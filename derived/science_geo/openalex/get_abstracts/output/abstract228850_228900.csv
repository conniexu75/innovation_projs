https://openalex.org/W2138708625,"The RNase III enzyme Dicer processes RNA into siRNAs and miRNAs, which direct a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to cleave mRNA or block its translation (RNAi). We have characterized mutations in the Drosophila dicer-1 and dicer-2 genes. Mutation in dicer-1 blocks processing of miRNA precursors, whereas dicer-2 mutants are defective for processing siRNA precursors. It has been recently found that Drosophila Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are also components of siRNA-dependent RISC (siRISC). We find that Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are required for siRNA-directed mRNA cleavage, though the RNase III activity of Dicer-2 is not required. Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 facilitate distinct steps in the assembly of siRISC. However, Dicer-1 but not Dicer-2 is essential for miRISC-directed translation repression. Thus, siRISCs and miRISCs are different with respect to Dicers in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2082471729,"Yeast mutants lacking meiotic proteins Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, Mer3, and/or Msh5 (ZMMs) were analyzed for recombination, synaptonemal complex (SC), and meiotic progression. At 33 degrees C, recombination-initiating double-strand breaks (DSBs) and noncrossover products (NCRs) form normally while formation of single-end invasion strand exchange intermediates (SEIs), double Holliday junctions, crossover products (CRs), and SC are coordinately defective. Thus, during wild-type meiosis, recombinational interactions are differentiated into CR and NCR types very early, prior to onset of stable strand exchange and independent of SC. By implication, crossover interference does not require SC formation. We suggest that SC formation may require interference. Subsequently, CR-designated DSBs undergo a tightly coupled, ZMM-promoted transition that yields SEI-containing recombination complexes embedded in patches of SC. zmm mutant phenotypes differ strikingly at 33 degrees C and 23 degrees C, implicating higher temperature as a positive effector of recombination and identifying a checkpoint that monitors local CR-specific events, not SC formation, at late leptotene."
https://openalex.org/W2156107051,"How much dissolved oxygen was present in the mid-Proterozoic oceans between 1.8 and 1.0 billion years ago is debated vigorously. One model argues for oxygenation of the oceans soon after the initial rise of atmospheric oxygen ∼2.3 billion years ago. Recent evidence for H 2 S in some mid-Proterozoic marine basins suggests, however, that the deep ocean remained anoxic until much later. New molybdenum isotope data from modern and ancient sediments indicate expanded anoxia during the mid-Proterozoic compared to the present-day ocean. Consequently, oxygenation of the deep oceans may have lagged that of the atmosphere by over a billion years."
https://openalex.org/W2164293876,"Experiments in both vertebrates and invertebrates have illustrated the competitive nature of growth and led to the idea that competition is a mechanism of regulating organ and tissue size. We have assessed competitive interactions between cells in a developing organ and examined their effect on its final size. We show that local expression of the Drosophila growth regulator dMyc, a homolog of the c-myc protooncogene, induces cell competition and leads to the death of nearby wild-type cells in developing wings. We demonstrate that cell competition is executed via induction of the proapoptotic gene hid and that both competition and hid function are required for the wing to reach an appropriate size when dMyc is expressed. Moreover, we provide evidence that reproducible wing size during normal development requires apoptosis. Modulating dmyc levels to create cell competition and hid-dependent cell death may be a mechanism used during normal development to control organ size."
https://openalex.org/W2050533433,"Overexpression of myc protooncogenes has been implicated in the genesis of many human tumors. Myc proteins seem to regulate diverse biological processes, but their role in tumorigenesis remains enigmatic. Here we use Drosophila imaginal discs to mimic situations in which cells with unequal levels of Myc protein are apposed and show that this invariably elicits a win/lose situation reminiscent of cell competition; cells with lower levels of dMyc are eliminated by apoptosis whereas cells with higher levels of dMyc over-proliferate. We find that this competitive behavior correlates with, and can be corrected by, the activation of the BMP/Dpp survival signaling pathway. Hence the heritable increase in dMyc levels causes cells to behave as ""super-competitors"" and reveals a novel mode of clonal expansion that causes, but also relies on, the killing of surrounding cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026992473,Al 13 – is a cluster known for the pronounced stability that arises from coincident closures of its geometric and electronic shells. We present experimental evidence for a very stable cluster corresponding to Al 13 I – . Ab initio calculations show that the cluster features a structurally unperturbed Al 13 – core and a region of high charge density on the aluminum vertex opposite from the iodine atom. This ionically bound magic cluster can be understood by considering that Al 13 has an electronic structure reminiscent of a halogen atom. Comparisons to polyhalides provide a sound explanation for our chemical observations.
https://openalex.org/W2080459765,"We use native gel electrophoresis to characterize complexes that mediate RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila. Our data reveal three distinct complexes (R1, R2, and R3) that assemble on short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in vitro. To form, all three complexes require Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), which directly contacts siRNAs in the ATP-independent R1 complex. R1 serves as a precursor to both the R2 and R3 complexes. R3 is a large (80S), ATP-enhanced complex that contains unwound siRNAs, cofractionates with known RNAi factors, and binds and cleaves targeted mRNAs in a cognate-siRNA-dependent manner. Our results establish an ordered biochemical pathway for RISC assembly and indicate that siRNAs must first interact with Dcr-2 to reach the R3 ""holo-RISC"" complex. Dcr-2 does not simply transfer siRNAs to a distinct effector complex, but rather assembles into RISC along with the siRNAs, indicating that its role extends beyond the initiation phase of RNAi."
https://openalex.org/W2021815265,"The vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1) plays a key role in the perception of peripheral thermal and inflammatory pain. TRPV1 expression and channel activity are notably up-regulated by proalgesic agents. The transduction pathways involved in TRPV1 sensitization are still elusive. We have used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that associate with the N terminus of TRPV1. We report that two vesicular proteins, Snapin and synaptotagmin IX (Syt IX), strongly interact in vitro and in vivo with the TRPV1 N-terminal domain. In primary dorsal root ganglion neurons, TRPV1 co-distributes in vesicles with Syt IX and the vesicular protein synaptobrevin. Neither Snapin nor Syt IX affected channel function, but they notably inhibited protein kinase C (PKC)-induced potentiation of TRPV1 channel activity with a potency that rivaled the blockade evoked by botulinum neurotoxin A, a potent blocker of neuronal exocytosis. Noteworthily, we found that PKC activation induced a rapid delivery of functional TRPV1 channels to the plasma membrane. Botulinum neurotoxin A blocked the TRPV1 membrane translocation induced by PKC that was activated with a phorbol ester or the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5. Therefore, our results indicate that PKC signaling promotes at least in part the SNARE-dependent exocytosis of TRPV1 to the cell surface. Taken together, these findings imply that activity-dependent delivery of channels to the neuronal surface may contribute to the buildup and maintenance of thermal inflammatory hyperalgesia in peripheral nociceptor terminals.

Heterologous expression of TRPV1 cDNA results in ionic currents that recapitulate most of the functional properties displayed by native capsaicin- and heat-activated currents in sensory neurons (1Scholz J. Woolf C.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5 (suppl.): 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 2Julius D. Basbaum A.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). For instance, TRPV1 exhibits a time- and Ca2+-dependent desensitization, a long lasting refractory state during which the receptor does not respond to vanilloids or other stimuli (2Julius D. Basbaum A.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). In addition, the channel activity of TRPV1 is remarkably up-regulated by inflammatory mediators through the activation of phospholipase C and protein kinases A and C (PKA and PKC) signaling pathways (4Crandall M.

Recent evidence shows that an increase in TRPV1 expression in peripheral nociceptors is critical for the maintenance of inflammatory hyperalgesia (14Ji R.R. Samad T.A. Jin S.X. Schmoll R. Woolf C.J.

The involvement of TRPV1 in heat hypersensitivity is further underscored by the reduced sensitivity of mice lacking TRPV1 (16Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J.

Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) and by mice treated with receptor-specific antagonists (18García-Martínez C. Humet M. Planells-Cases R. Gomis A. Caprini M. Viana F. De La Peña E. Sanchez-Baeza F. Carbonell T. De Felipe C. Perez-Paya E. Belmonte C. Messeguer A. Ferrer-Montiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2374-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). TRPV1 belongs to the family of transient receptor potential channels, which structurally resembles the family of voltage-gated potassium or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (19Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these channels are presumed to be tetrameric assemblies of identical subunits (Fig. 1A), although heteromeric assemblies have been reported in heterologous systems (20Smith G.D. Gunthorpe M.J. Kelsell R.E. Hayes P.D. Reilly P. Facer P. Wright J.E. Jerman J.C. Walhin J.P. Ooi L. Egerton J. Charles K.J. Smart D. Randall A.D. Anand P. Davis J.B. Nature. 2002; 418: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Each subunit has six membrane-spanning domains (S1–S6) and cytosolic carboxyl and amino termini. These intracellular domains have consensus sequences for protein kinases. Phosphorylation of the C terminus with PKC remarkably sensitizes TRPV1 channel activity by augmenting the channel open probability (5Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 13Bhave G. Hu H.-J. Glauner K.S. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau IV, R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 21: 12480-12485Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKC-mediated phosphorylation also decreases the heat threshold of channel activation (5Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 6Vellani V. Mapplebeck S. Moriondo A. Davis J.B. McNaughton P.A. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of the N terminus with PKA affects TRPV1 channel function by modulating the rate and extent of receptor desensitization (9Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau IV, R.W. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In addition, the C- and N termini display the presence of putative lipid-protein and protein-protein interacting domains that may also contribute to the regulation of receptor channel properties. Indeed, the association of the C terminus with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate inhibits the channel activity (7Prescott E.D. Julius D. Science. 2003; 300: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 8Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D. Nature. 2001; 411: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), and its interaction with calmodulin promotes channel desensitization (12Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Takeuchi K. Murayama N. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8002-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, the identification of proteins that interact with the N-terminal region of TRPV1 has remained elusive despite the fact that this segment contains potential protein-protein interacting domains such as a relatively proline-rich region and three ankyrin repeats (1Scholz J. Woolf C.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5 (suppl.): 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 2Julius D. Basbaum A.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 19Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Here, we addressed this issue and used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that associate with the N terminus of TRPV1 (referred to as N-TRPV1; Fig. 1A) and modulate its functional properties. We report the identification of two vesicular proteins, Syt IX and Snapin, that strongly interact with the TRPV1 channel, suggesting that this channel is located in vesicles that participate in SNARE-dependent exocytosis. Noteworthily, we found that PKC-mediated potentiation of TRPV1 channel activity in cells occurs in part by rapid recruitment of vesicular channels to the cell surface by regulated exocytosis. These findings suggest that TRPV1 sensitization by proalgesic agents that activate PKC signaling appears to involve the concerted activation of surface resident channels and the mobilization of receptors from a vesicular pool. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the MATCHMAKER GAL4-based two-hybrid system (Clontech) as described by the manufacturer. The full-length cytosolic N-terminal domain of TRPV1 (residues 1–414) was cloned into pG-BKT7-BD and transformed into the PJ69–2A strain of Saccaromyces cerevisiae. Screening was made by conjugation against strain Y187 pretransformed with the rat brain cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain of plasmid PACT2 (Clontech). Positive interactions were identified by the ability of yeast to grow on selective medium in the absence of histidine and adenine and the presence of 40 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and X-α-Gal for α-galactosidase expression. Plasmids and Deletions—cDNAs of Syt IX, Syt I, and Snapin were obtained by PCR with specific primers from a human DRG library (21Caprini M. Gomis A. Cabedo H. Planells-Cases R. Belmonte C. Viana F. Ferrer-Montiel A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1-Myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen). N-TRPV1 was cloned into the pET-22b plasmid (Qiagen) as a His6 fusion protein. Deletion species were generated by inverse PCR (22Cabedo H. Luna C. Fernandez A.M. Gallar J. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19905-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Vitro His Pull-down Assay—Fusion proteins were affinity-purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen). Immobilized fusion proteins (≈10 μg) were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]Snapin or [35S]Syt IX (TnT T7 Quick Coupled transcription/translation system, Promega) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 16 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8) for 2 h at 22 °C. After three washes with binding buffer, Ni2+-bound complexes were eluted from the resin and denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 90 °C for 10 min. Proteins complexes were resolved by SDS/PAGE on 12% gels, visualized by autofluorography, and quantified as described (23Blanes-Mira C. Ibanez C. Fernandez-Ballester G. Planells-Cases R. Perez-Paya E. Ferrer-Montiel A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2234-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HEK293 cells (1.5 × 106) were transfected with 1 μg of full-length TRPV1 and Myc-Snapin, Myc-Syt IX, or Myc-Syt I using the LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and solubilized with 900 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm iodoacetamide) for 15 min at 22 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-TRPV1 serum (1:200). Thereafter, 30 μl of agarose-protein G beads (Pierce) were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (90 °C for 5 min), separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western immunoblotting using an anti-c-Myc antibody (1:2,000) (Sigma). Anti-TRPV1 Serum—A synthetic peptide encoding the C terminus of rat TRPV1 (EVFKDSMVPGEK; DiverDrugs S.L.) was coupled to key-hole limpet hemocyanin and administered to rabbits to raise a polyclonal anti-TRPV1 serum. Immunocytochemistry—Adult rat DRGs (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar) were isolated, incubated in 0.125% collagenase for 3 h, washed, mechanically dissociated with glass pipettes, and plated on polyornithine- and laminin-coated glass coverslips. Cells were incubated for 72–96 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum before immunocytochemical analysis. Primary cultures were fixed, blocked, permeabilized, and subsequently incubated with the following primary antibodies and dilutions: 1:2000 anti-TRPV1 (Chemicon); 1:500 anti-Syt IX (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and 1:500 anti-VAMP2 (clone Cl69.1) (Synaptic Systems). After washing, the cultures were incubated with secondary antibodies, washed, embedded, and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS). Oocyte Electrophysiology—Amphibian oocytes were harvested and microinjected with cRNA encoding the rat TRPV1 channel, Snapin, and Syt IX as described previously (18García-Martínez C. Humet M. Planells-Cases R. Gomis A. Caprini M. Viana F. De La Peña E. Sanchez-Baeza F. Carbonell T. De Felipe C. Perez-Paya E. Belmonte C. Messeguer A. Ferrer-Montiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2374-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents in oocytes were recorded with a two-microelectrode voltage clamp amplifier. Oocytes were continuously perfused (2 ml min-1) in Mg2+-Ringer's solution (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 115 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 0.1 mm BaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2) at 20 °C. TRPV1 currents were activated with acidic solution (Mg2+-Ringer's solution with 10 mm MES, pH 6) or capsaicin at the indicated concentrations. The holding potential was kept at -40 mV. Recordings were performed 3–5 days after injection. The recombinant BoNT A catalytic domain was expressed and purified as described (23Blanes-Mira C. Ibanez C. Fernandez-Ballester G. Planells-Cases R. Perez-Paya E. Ferrer-Montiel A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2234-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the exception that detergents were not present during the purification process. Oocytes were microinjected with 1 μm neurotoxin 12 h before current recordings. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 4α-TPA (Sigma), and bisindolylmaleimide I (Calbiochem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Biotin Labeling of Surface Proteins—Control and TPA-treated (3 × 30-s pulses of 1 μm TPA) oocytes (30 cells) expressing TRPV1 were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Biotin-conjugated cell surface proteins were purified with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma). Surface TRPV1 was detected by Western blotting with the anti-TRPV1 serum. Immunoblots were digitized and quantified as described (23Blanes-Mira C. Ibanez C. Fernandez-Ballester G. Planells-Cases R. Perez-Paya E. Ferrer-Montiel A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2234-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Syt IX and Snapin Interact with the N Terminus of TRPV1— To identify proteins that interact with the N-terminal domain of TRPV1, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen a rat brain complementary DNA library using the rat N-TRPV1 (residues 1–414; Fig. 1A) as bait. A brain-derived library was employed because the receptor is also expressed in this tissue (24Mezey E. Toth Z.E. Cortright D.N. Arzubi M.K. Krause J.E. Elde R. Guo A. Blumberg P.M. Szallasi A. Proc.

We identified Syt IX and Snapin, two synaptic vesicle proteins involved in regulated exocytosis (26Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 27Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), as interacting partners of the N-TRPV1 domain (Fig. 1B). Both proteins were cloned from a cDNA library from human DRGs. To verify that Snapin and Syt IX bind directly to the N terminus of TRPV1 and to determine the interacting domain on the channel, hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins of wild type (N-TRPV1-His) and N-TRPV1 deletion mutants were immobilized on nickel-agarose beads and incubated with in vitro translated [35S]Snapin or [35S]Syt IX (Fig. 2). As illustrated (Fig. 2A, lane2), both proteins were retained specifically by the N-TRPV1-His fusion protein but not by resin alone (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Deletion analysis of the N-TRPV1 domain indicates that Snapin and Syt IX bind preferentially to the ankyrin repeats, as evidenced by the enhanced interaction of both proteins with the construct encompassing residues 200–414 (Δ2–199-His) that contains the ankyrin core structure. Removal of the three ankyrin repeats notably weakened the interaction, although it did not completely abrogate it, suggesting that neighboring domains may contribute to protein binding. These data demonstrate that Snapin and Syt IX strongly interact in vitro with the N-TRPV1. Because Syt IX is structurally and functionally related to Syt I, a synaptotagmin isoform abundantly expressed in vesicles that undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (26Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (396) Google Scholar), we questioned whether Syt I also interacts with the N-TRPV1. As shown in Fig. 2A, [35S]Syt I was retained by an immobilized N-TRPV1-His fusion protein. Similarly, Syt I was preferentially bound to the core ankyrin repeats. We next examined the role of the two Ca2+ binding sites, C2A and C2B, which are present in Syt IX in the interaction with N-TRPV1 (Fig. 2B). Pull-down experiments of Syt IX deletion species in which one of the C2 sites has been removed indicate that the N-TRPV1 domain could interact with both Ca2+ domains, although it seems to bind slightly stronger to the C2A domain. In support of this tenet, a peptide patterned after the C2A domain potently inhibited the interaction of Syt IX with the N-TRPV1-His fusion protein (n = 3, Fig. 2C). Saturation of the fusion protein with an unrelated peptide did not affect the binding capacity of Syt IX (Fig. 2C). Syt IX and Snapin Associate with TRPV1—The association of Snapin and Syt IX with the TRPV1 channel was next evaluated in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. Full-length, Myc-tagged Snapin and Syt IX were co-expressed with the TRPV1 receptor in HEK293 cells, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-TRPV1 serum against the C terminus. Fig. 3, A and B show that Myc-tagged Snapin and Syt IX were readily co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-TRPV1 serum. IgGs from non-immunized rabbits were not able to immunopurify these proteins (data not shown). Likewise, Myc-tagged Syt I also interacted with the TRPV1 receptor in cells, as evidenced by its co-immunopurification with the anti-TRPV1 antibody (Fig. 3C). Notice, however, that the in vivo association of TRPV1 with Syt I was lower than with Syt IX, which is consistent with the weaker interaction seen in vitro. These results demonstrate that the full-length TRPV1 channel associates with vesicular Syt IX and Snapin proteins in vivo. TRPV1 Localizes in Synaptic Vesicles in DRG Neurons—The interaction of TRPV1 with vesicular SNARE proteins suggests that the channel is sorted into synaptic vesicles in neurons. To address this issue, we investigated the co-distribution of TRPV1 with Syt IX in primary cultures of DRG neurones by immunocytochemistry using specific anti-TRPV1 and anti-Syt IX antibodies. As depicted in Fig. 4A, Syt IX and TRPV1 exhibited a widespread subcellular localization, especially in the soma of the neurons. The overlay of both immunoreactivities revealed a neuronal co-distribution of both proteins, suggesting the presence of TRPV1 in vesicles. This finding was further supported by the codistribution of TRPV1 channels with the synaptic vesicle marker VAMP2, as evidenced by the colocalization of the immunoreactivities of both proteins in DRG neurons (Fig. 4, B and C). Vesicular localization was observed in the cell body as well as in neuronal processes (Fig. 4B). Note that the puncta co-stained by TRPV1 and VAMP2 along the neuronal processes were significantly larger (≥200 nm) than the average synaptic vesicles (≈50 nm), suggesting that they may represent the so-called “cytoplasmic transport packets” (29Greka A. Navarro B. Lancea E. Duggan A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 30Ahmari S.E. Buchanan J. Smith S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that TRPV1 is sorted into synaptic vesicles and transported to synaptic terminals by vesicular clusters. Syt IX and Snapin Do Not Modulate TRVP1 Channel Properties—We next evaluated whether Snapin and/or Syt IX modulated the channel activity of TRPV1. The TRPV1 receptor was co-expressed with Snapin or Syt IX in Xenopus oocytes, and the receptor channel activity was monitored by a two-microelectrode voltage clamp. As summarized in Table I, the overall channel properties of TRPV1 were not altered by the expression of Syt IX or of Snapin, although Snapin mildly affected the kinetics of pH-induced responses (see also the supplemental data in the on-line version of this article). These data are consistent with the notion that the interaction of the vesicular SNARE proteins with TRPV1 occurs in vesicles rather than on the cell surface and suggest that these proteins may modulate aspects of receptor trafficking.Table IIon channel properties of TRPV1 in the presence of Syt IX and Snapin Values are given as mean ± S.D. n indicates the number of oocytes. *, p < 0.01 (Student's t test).TRPV1TRPV1 + Syt IXTRPV1 + SnapinImax, capsaicin (nA)aPeak current elicited by 10 μm capsaicin at -40 mV485 ± 191548 ± 207385 ± 200N = 15n = 17n = 17ICap/IpHbRatio of the inward current elicited by 10 μm capsaicin (Cap) with respect to that evoked by an acidic solution (pH 6)1.4 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.2n = 6(n = 6)n = 6EC50 (capsaicin; μm)cEC50 is the concentration of capsaicin required to activate the half-maximal response obtained from a dose-response curve (18)1.4 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.2n = 4n = 4n = 4IC50 (RR; μm)dIC50 is the concentration of ruthenium red (RR) needed to block the half-maximal response elicited by 10 μm capsaicin obtained from a dose-response curve (18)0.45 ± 0.050.32 ± 0.080.37 ± 0.06n = 3n = 3n = 3Vr (mV)eReversal potential of the ionic current elicited by an acidic solution (pH = 6)-4.5 ± 2.3-3.2 ± 3.0-6.0 ± 3.7n = 3n = 3n = 3τoff (s) (capsaicin)fτoff is the time constant of the deactivation process of capsaicin and pH-evoked ionic currents9.7 ± 0.69.8 ± 2.19.8 ± 1.4n = 8n = 8n = 8τoff (s) (pH)gτoff is the time constant of the deactivation process of pH-evoked ionic currents5.7 ± 1.04.4 ± 1.73.5 ± 0.6*n = 4n = 4n = 4a Peak current elicited by 10 μm capsaicin at -40 mVb Ratio of the inward current elicited by 10 μm capsaicin (Cap) with respect to that evoked by an acidic solution (pH 6)c EC50 is the concentration of capsaicin required to activate the half-maximal response obtained from a dose-response curve (18García-Martínez C.

https://openalex.org/W2145661991,"A role for norepinephrine in learning and memory has been elusive and controversial. A longstanding hypothesis states that the adrenergic nervous system mediates enhanced memory consolidation of emotional events. We tested this hypothesis in several learning tasks using mutant mice conditionally lacking norepinephrine and epinephrine, as well as control mice and rats treated with adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists. We find that adrenergic signaling is critical for the retrieval of intermediate-term contextual and spatial memories, but is not necessary for the retrieval or consolidation of emotional memories in general. The role of norepinephrine in retrieval requires signaling through the β1-adrenergic receptor in the hippocampus. The results demonstrate that mechanisms of memory retrieval can vary over time and can be different from those required for acquisition or consolidation. These findings may be relevant to symptoms in several neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the treatment of cardiac failure with β blockers."

The 2.1 A crystal structure of the bifunctional catalytic fragment of the Rel/Spo homolog from Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Rel(Seq), reveals two conformations of the enzyme corresponding to known reciprocal activity states: (p)ppGpp-hydrolase-OFF/(p)ppGpp-synthetase-ON and hydrolase-ON/synthetase-OFF. The hydrolase and synthetase domains bear remarkable similarities to the catalytic domains of the cyclic phosphodiesterase and nucleotidyltransferase superfamilies, respectively. The active sites, separated by more than 30 A, contain bound nucleotides including an unusual (p)ppGpp derivative, GDP-2':3'-cyclic monophosphate. Reciprocal regulation of the antagonistic catalytic activities, suggested by the structure, is supported by mutagenesis experiments and appears to involve ligand-induced signal transmission between the two active sites."

Here, we have identified an unanticipated role for CK2. We show that this essential protein kinase phosphorylates the scaffold protein XRCC1 and thereby enables the assembly and activity of DNA single-strand break repair protein complexes in vitro and at sites of chromosomal breakage. Moreover, we show that inhibiting XRCC1 phosphorylation by mutation of the CK2 phosphorylation sites or preventing CK2 activity using a highly specific inhibitor ablates the rapid repair of cellular DNA single-strand breaks by XRCC1. These data identify a direct role for CK2 in the repair of chromosomal DNA strand breaks and in maintaining genetic integrity."

Mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 gene are deficient in tissue oleate and have reduced expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and its target genes. The SREBP-1c isoform is a known mediator of insulin action on hepatic gene expression, but its transcriptional effects due to glucose or fructose are still unclear. We found that fructose compared with glucose is a stronger inducer of SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression, causing a dramatic increase in hepatic triglyceride levels. However, when fed to the SCD1–/– mice, fructose failed to induce SREBP-1 or lipogenic genes and the triglyceride levels were not increased. Instead fructose feeding caused a decrease in hepatic glycogen and plasma glucose levels. The induction of SREBP-1 and lipogenic gene expression as well as the levels of liver triglycerides, glycogen, and plasma glucose was partially restored when the fructose diet was supplemented with very high levels of oleate (20% by weight) but not with palmitate, stearate, or linoleate. Fructose in a long term feeding induced the expression of SCD1 and that of other lipogenic genes in the liver of SREBP-1c–/– mice, and a further increase in expression of these genes occurred when the fructose diet was supplemented with oleate. Our observations demonstrated that oleate produced by SCD is necessary for fructose-mediated induction of lipogenic gene expression through SREBP-1c-dependent and -independent mechanisms and suggested that SCD1 gene expression is important in lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins are members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors and regulate enzymes responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides (35Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). There are three characterized isoforms of SREBP. SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are derived from a single gene through the use of alternative promoters that give rise to the diverse first exon. SREBP-1a is the predominant form in cultured cells and a stronger activator of transcription of genes controlling lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis (36Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The roles of SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 are more restricted than that of SREBP-1a. Transgenic animal studies showed that SREBP-1c preferentially stimulates transcription of lipogenic genes in response to insulin and high carbohydrate feeding, whereas SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes involved in cholesterol synthesis (37Shimano H.

The worldwide prevalence of obesity is increasing, and although it is probable that no single factor is responsible, environmental factors interacting with predisposing genetic factors are involved (40Ogden C.L. Flegal K.M. Carroll M.D. Johnson C.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 288: 1728-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar, 41Flegal K.M. Carroll M.D. Ogden C.L. Johnson C.L. J. Am. Med.

Assoc. 1994; 272: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). One of these environmental elements is diet, and currently, changes in the diet are being studied as contributing factors to the development of obesity. Along with an increase in total energy consumption over the past decades, there has been a shift in the types of nutrients consumed worldwide (43Elliott S.S. Keim N.L. Stern J.S. Teff K. Havel P.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The consumption of fructose has increased, largely because of an increase in the consumption of soft drinks and many other beverages that contain high levels of fructose (43Elliott S.S. Keim N.L. Stern J.S. Teff K. Havel P.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which fructose may contribute to the development of obesity and accompanying abnormalities of insulin resistance have not been well addressed. We show in this study that when mice are fed either glucose or fructose individually, fructose is a stronger inducer of liver SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression than glucose. However, fructose failed to induce SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression in SCD1–/– mice. Fructose feeding was instead accompanied by a decrease in liver glycogen and plasma glucose levels. SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression, as well as triglyceride and glycogen levels, were partially restored in the SCD1–/– mice when the fructose diet was supplemented with high levels of dietary oleate and after feeding for 7 days. Stearate or palmitate supplementation to the fructose diet did not induce SREBP-1c or lipogenic gene expression. Liver triglyceride, liver glycogen, and plasma glucose levels were not rescued. Long term feeding of fructose also induced the expression of SCD1 and other lipogenic genes in SREBP-1c–/– mice. Supplementing the fructose diet with oleate did change SCD1 mRNA levels but caused additional increase in the mRNA levels of FAS and ACC. Taken together, our observations demonstrated that fructose-mediated induction of SREBP-1c or lipogenic genes is highly dependent on SCD1 gene expression and suggested that regulation of SCD1 plays an important role in carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis. Animals and Diets—The generation of SCD1–/– mice has been described previously (44Miyazaki M. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Nutr. 2001; 13: 2260-2268Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Pre-bred homozygous (SCD1–/–) and wild-type (SCD1+/+) mice on a pure 129 SV background were used. The SREBP-1c–/– mice were from the Jackson Laboratory and were bred into 129S6/SvEv background at least for five generations. 16–20-week-old mice were used in all of the experiments. Three mice were housed/caged and fed a standard chow diet (number 7001, Harlan Teklad), a 60% fructose diet (catalog number TD02518, Harlan Teklad), or a 60% glucose diet (TD02519) for 2 or 7 days. Triolein, tripalmitin, and tristearin (99% purity, Sigma) were supplemented to the fructose diet at 20 g weight % of diet. Dietary fat absorption was assessed by delivering 2mm bovine serum albumin complex containing 1 μCi of [14C]palmitate and phosphatidylcholine-liposome containing 1 μCi of [3H]sitostanol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) by oral gavage to the mouse after a 4-h fast. Animals were given ad libitum access to food and water after gavage. Total feces were collected for 3 days, and the ratio of 14C to 3H radioactivity in aliquots of fecal extracts were used to calculate the percent dietary fat absorption. The breeding and care of the animals are in accordance with the protocols approved by the Animal Care Research Committee (ACRC) of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Materials—Radioactive [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Thin layer chromatography plates (TLC Silica Gel G60) were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The cDNA probes for SCD1, FAS, and SREBP-1 have been described previously (25Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1018-1024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 antibodies were from Dr. Jay Horton (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Isolation and Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was isolated from livers of SCD1–/– mice and SREBP-1c–/– mice as well as the appropriate wild-type controls using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The isolated RNA from livers of 4–6 mice in each group were pooled, and 15 μg of total RNA were separated by 1.0% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The cDNA probes for long chain fatty acyl-CoA elongase (LFAE, GenBank™ accession number AY053453), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC, GenBank™ accession numbers J03808 and NM000664), fructokinase (FK, GenBank™ accession number Y09335), and aldolase B (GenBank™ accession number AH011101) were prepared by RT-PCR. The primers used for PCR were as follows. For ACC, the 5′ primer was 5′-GGGACTTCATGAATTTGCTGATTCTCA-3′ and the 3′ primer was 5′-GTCATTACCATCTTCATTTACCTCAATC-3′. For long chain fatty acyl-CoA elongase, the 5′ primer was 5′-CCTGTTTTCTGCGCTGTACGG-3′ and the 3′ primer was 5′-GCATGCACGCCATAGTTCAT-3′. For FK, the 5′ primer was 5′-GAATGCATCGGAACAGGTGA-3′ and the 3′ primer was 5′-GCTTGCCTCTCACACAATGC-3′. For aldolase B, the 5′ primer was 5′-CAATGCTCTGGCTCGCTATG-3′ and the 3′ primer was 5′-CTTCCTGGGTTGCCTTCTTG-3′. SREBP-1c, SREBP-1a, and SREBP-2 isoform mRNAs were analyzed by RT-PCR (18Miyazaki M.

Specific primers for SREBP isoforms were designed as described previously (45Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—For the immunoblotting of the SREBP proteins, nuclear extracts and membrane fractions of mice livers were prepared according to the methods of Shimomura et al. (46Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12354-12359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Aliquots of nuclear extracts (20 μg) were mixed with SDS loading buffer, subjected to SDS/PAGE on an 8% gel, transferred, and immobilized on Immobilon-P transfer membranes. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline buffer (pH 8.0) plus Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight, the membranes were washed and incubated with polyclonal anti-SREBP-1 or anti-SREBP-2 as primary antibody and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate as the secondary antibody. Visualization of the SREBP proteins was performed with Western blotting detection system kit (Pierce). Lipid Analysis—Total lipids were extracted from liver according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (47Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were separated by TLC (hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid, 80:20:1), and the bands were scraped from the plates, methylated, and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as described previously (48Miyazaki M. Kim H.J. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39455-39461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Pentadecanoic acid (Sigma) was added as an internal standard for the quantitation of fatty acids. Glucose and Glycogen Determinations—Plasma glucose was analyzed using colorimetric glucose oxidase method (Sigma), and glycogen content was measured according to the methods of Roehrig and Allred (49Roehrig K.L. Allred J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with either one-way ANOVA or Student's t test with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Fig. 1 shows a Northern blot of total RNA isolated from the liver of wild-type mice that were fed chow, high glucose, or fructose diets for 7 days measuring the mRNA levels of SREBP-1 and lipogenic genes. The 7-day feeding period was used to ensure maximum induction of mRNA levels. Dietary glucose increased the mRNA levels of SREBP-1, SCD1, LFAE, FAS, and ACC by 1.5-, 4.7-, 2.8-, 2.3-, and 1.9-fold, respectively, whereas fructose increased the levels of these mRNAs by 2.6-, 19.6-, 7.9-, 7.0-, and 9.1-fold, respectively, relative to chow diet. The effect of glucose or fructose on the expression of SREBP isoforms was analyzed by RT-PCR. Fig. 1B shows that glucose induced the mRNA level of SREBP-1c isoform by 1.5-fold, whereas fructose induced it by 2.9-fold relative to chow diet. Glucose or fructose did not induce SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 mRNA expression. Consistent with the Northern blot, fructose induced the mature form of SREBP-1 protein 3.8-fold, whereas glucose did not induce it (Fig. 1C). The levels of the mature form of SREBP-2 protein were not altered by either sugar. These experiments indicated that fructose is a stronger inducer of SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression than glucose. Mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 isoform have reduced body adiposity and down-regulated expression of several genes encoding enzymes of fatty acid and triglyceride biosynthesis (22Ntambi J.M. Miyazaki M. Stoehr J.P. Lan H. Kendziorski C.M. Yandell B.S. Song Y. Cohen P. Friedman J.M. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11482-11486Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). We sought to explore the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency causes reduced lipogenesis by feeding the highly lipogenic fructose diet to the SCD1–/– mice and measuring the expression of SREBP-1c and its target genes. Fig. 2 shows that, whereas fructose induced SREBP-1, SCD1, FAS, and ACC mRNA levels by 2.3-, 16.3-, 9.8-, and 13.3-fold, respectively, in the wild-type mice relative to chow diet, fructose did not induce SREBP-1, FAS, and ACC mRNA expression in the SCD1–/– mice. Food intake of the fructose diet was not different between SCD1–/– and wild-type mice (3.1 ± 0.3 g/day SCD1–/– mice versus 2.9 ± 0.4 g/day wild-type mice). To check the nutritional status of the mice, we measured the mRNA expression of fructokinase and aldolase B genes. These genes encode for fructokinase and aldolase B enzymes, which are increased by fructose feeding (50Adelman R.C. Spolter P.D. Weinhouse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5467-5472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that fructose induced fructokinase and aldolase B mRNA levels by >2-fold in both wild type and SCD1–/– mice, demonstrating that both groups of mice were correctly fed fructose. Consistent with the Northern blot (Fig. 2A), Fig. 2B shows that fructose increased the content of the precursor and mature forms of SREBP-1 protein by 1.8- and 4-fold, respectively, in the wild-type mice, but no such induction was observed in the SCD1–/– mice. The content of the precursor and mature forms of SREBP-2 proteins was not changed in the wild-type and SCD1–/– mice in response to fructose feeding. Oleate is the major product of SCD (48Miyazaki M. Kim H.J. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39455-39461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether oleate is required for the induction of SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression, SCD1–/– mice were fed a fructose diet supplemented with 5% triolein (18:1) for 2 or 7 days and mRNA expression of SREBP-1, FAS, and ACC were measured. Because there was no increase in the levels of these mRNAs in the liver of SCD1–/– mice (data not shown), the amount of triolein supplemented to the fructose diet was increased to 20% by weight. A two-day feeding of fructose induced SREBP-1 and lipogenic genes in the wild-type mice but not in the SCD1–/– mice (data not shown). Fig. 2A shows that 20% triolein (18:1) supplementation to the fructose diet for 2 days still did not increase the mRNA for SREBP-1, FAS, and ACC in the SCD1–/– mice, but a 4.3-, 3.5-, and 7.0-fold induction, respectively, relative to the fructose-fed mice occurred after a 7-day feeding period. Triolein supplementation caused a further increase in the expression of SREBP-1, FAS, and ACC mRNA levels in the wild-type mice, but the mRNA level of SCD1 was not increased. Consistent with the Northern blot (Fig. 2), 20% triolein feeding increased the content of the mature SREBP-1 protein in the wild-type and SCD1–/– mice 6.7- and 5.3-fold, respectively, relative to a chow diet feeding (Fig. 2B). The content of precursor and mature forms of SREBP-2 proteins were not affected by triolein feeding. Fructose supplemented with tristearin (18:0) did not induce SREBP-1, FAS, and ACC mRNA levels, and the content of the mature form of SREBP-1 protein was not increased in SCD1–/– mice (Fig. 2B). The content of the precursor and mature form of SREBP-2 protein was not changed. In another experiment, 20% tripalmitin (16:0) or trilinolein (18:2n-6) supplementation to the fructose diet did not induce the mRNA levels for SREBP-1, ACC, and FAS in the SCD1–/– mice (Fig. 2C) and the levels of the mature form of SREBP-1 protein were not increased (Fig. 2D). Dietary fat absorption as assessed by the ratio of 14C to 3H radioactivity of [14C]palmitate and of phosphatidylcholine-liposome containing [3H]sitostanol in the feces of SCD1–/– and wild type mice was not different (data not shown). These experiments suggested that fructose-mediated induction of SREBP-1 and lipogenic gene expression requires oleate. To determine whether oleate is required for fructose-mediated changes in triglyceride levels, we measured liver and plasma triglycerides in the SCD1+/+ and SCD1–/– mice after 7 days of feeding. Fig. 3A shows that fructose caused a 2.7-fold increase in liver triglyceride levels in the wild-type mice but that no increase in triglyceride content was observed in the SCD1–/– mice. Triolein (20%) supplementation caused a further 1.5-fold increase in liver triglyceride content relative to fructose feeding in wild-type mice but caused a 4.8-fold increase in triglyceride content in the SCD1–/– mice. Tristearin or tripalmitin supplementation did"

However, no potent inhibitors have been discovered so far. This report describes the identification and characterization of highly potent bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors with antibacterial activity for the first time. We demonstrate that pseudopeptide pyrrolidine dione antibiotics such as moiramide B inhibit the Escherichia coli enzyme at nanomolar concentrations. Moiramide B targets the carboxyltransferase reaction of this enzyme with a competitive inhibition pattern versus malonyl-CoA (Ki value = 5 nm). Inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of the pyrrolidine diones is also demonstrated using recombinantly expressed carboxyltransferases from other bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We isolated pyrrolidine dione-resistant strains of E. coli, S. aureus, and Bacillus subtilis, which contain mutations within the carboxyltransferase subunits AccA or AccD. We demonstrate that such mutations confer resistance to pyrrolidine diones. Inhibition values (IC50) of >100 μm regarding an eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylase from rat liver indicate high selectivity of pyrrolidine diones for the bacterial multisubunit enzyme. The natural product moiramide B and synthetic analogues show broad-spectrum antibacterial activity.

Whereas higher eukaryotes carry out these reactions by a large multifunctional protein (type I pathway (1Chirala S.S. Huang W.Y. Jayakumar A. Sakai K. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because of the high structural conservation of many bacterial FAS enzymes among different species this pathway appears to be suited to be targeted by inhibitors with broad-spectrum antibacterial potency (4Campbell J.W.

Nevertheless, critical aspects also accompany FAS as the antibiotic target area. The fatty acid composition of bacteria varies from species to species, leading to variations in enzymatic properties of orthologs and to variable numbers of isoforms (11Marrakchi H. Zhang Y.M.

Chem. 2003; 46: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To avoid difficulties mentioned before, another key enzyme of FAS has attracted attention, the bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). It is a multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in FAS. It is broadly conserved among bacteria and no isoforms are known (exceptions: some actinobacteria). Its rate-limiting role in FAS has been shown for E. coli, where overexpression of this enzyme increased the rate of FAS (19Davis M.S. Solbiati J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28593-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that ACC is a site of feedback inhibition by-products of the FAS pathway, the acyl-ACPs (20Davis M.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in Bacillus subtilis indicated that the product of the ACC-catalyzed reaction malonyl-CoA plays major roles in regulating the expression of other FAS enzymes (21Schujman G.E. Paoletti L. Grossman A.D. de Mendoza D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 663-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings suggest that the bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase could be an appropriate target for the design of novel broad-spectrum antibacterials. The acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction can be divided into two partial reactions (22Cronan Jr., J.E. Waldrop G.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 407-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In the first step the biotin, attached to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP = AccB), is carboxylated via ATP consumption by the biotin carboxylase AccC. Second, the carboxyl group is transferred to acetyl-CoA yielding malonyl-CoA by the carboxyltransferase, which is composed of subunits AccA and -D. Studies with the E. coli enzyme showed that the ACC complex contains each subunit as a dimer. After cell lysis the complex dissociates into two stable complexes, the biotin carboxylase and the carboxyltransferase subcomplexes (23Fall R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 450: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Only reaction intermediates and bisubstrate analogues without antibacterial activity have been published so far, representing moderate inhibitors of the two partial reactions of ACC (24Levert K.L. Waldrop G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Blanchard C.Z. Amspacher D. Strongin R. Waldrop G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, numerous natural compounds have been described as broad-spectrum antibacterials with unknown modes of action. Our efforts to decipher the targets of not yet mechanistically examined natural products led us to the identification of the first highly potent bacterial ACC inhibitors. We show that the pseudopeptide pyrrolidine dione antibiotics moiramide B (CPD1) and andrimid (CPD5; Fig. 2) (26Needham J. Kelly M.T. Ishige M. Andersen R.J. J. Org.

Microbios. 1994; 78: 7-16PubMed Google Scholar) act by inhibiting the carboxyltransferases of bacterial ACCs. Media, Materials, and Strains—Various media for cell growth were used: DO (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), LB (Difco), M9 (Difco), and Brain Heart Infusion medium (Oxoid) as well as Isosensitest broth (Oxoid). Columbia agar plates with 5% sheep blood (BD Biosciences), bovine serum (Oxoid), and Aerocult C filter paper bags (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were necessary for S. pneumoniae cultivation. Radioactively labeled metabolites were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Other purchased reagents included calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, T4 DNA ligase, DNA polymerase, protein and DNA molecular weight markers (Invitrogen), various substrates and ingredients for enzymatic assays (Sigma), as well as antibiotics for growth selection (Sigma). The compounds CPD1 to 5 were synthesized according to previously published procedures (30Davies S.G. Dixon D.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1998; 17: 2635-2644Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cloning was generally performed in E. coli XL1Blue (Stratagene). The E. coli BLR(DE3) strain carrying plasmid pMSD8 (19Davis M.S. Solbiati J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28593-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) was used for overproduction of the complete ACC complex. The plasmid pS47 was a derivative of expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) carrying a fragment of accC from E. coli MG1655 (codons 2 to 451 including the termination codon). Recombination experiments in B. subtilis were performed with strain 168 (31Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using plasmids pDG1731xyl (32Haas M. Beyer D. Gahlmann R. Freiberg C. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and pS42. 2C. Freiberg, H. P. Fischer, and N. A. Brunner, submitted for publication. Other bacterial strains used in this study were E. coli MG1655 (PC 4007, Phabagen collection, Utrecht University, Netherlands), E. coli strain “Neumann” (DSM number 10650, DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany), E. coli HN818 carrying a deletion of acrA encoding an efflux system component (34Ma D. Cook D.N. Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), Staphylococcus aureus isolate 133, S. pneumoniae isolate G9A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 (NCCB 2452, Netherlands Culture Collection), and P. aeruginosa strain PAO200 carrying a deletion of mexAB-oprM encoding an antibiotic efflux system (35Schweizer H.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 394-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of Carboxyltransferases—The subunits accA and accD of different organisms were cloned as one operon such as previously described for E. coli (36Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification of the genes accA and accD are listed in Table I. The obtained PCR products of each species were fused via a second crossover PCR using the 5′-terminal accA and 3′-terminal accD primers (called ACCA1A and ACCD2B). The resulting plasmids, pGF1, pS39, pS38, and pS35, contained accAD from E. coli, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The plasmids enabled expression of the carboxyltransferases with a 6-amino acid His tag fused to the amino terminus of the α subunit AccA.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyPrimer nameSequence (5′-3′ direction)ACCA1A_ECOCCGGGAATTCCATATGAGTCTGAATTTCCTTGATTTTGAAACCA1B_ECOCTCATCTCGAGTTCTCCTTACGCGTAACCGTAGCTCATCAGGCGACCD2A_ECOCGTAAGGAGAACTCGAGATGAGCTGGATTGAACGAATTAAAAGCACCD2B_ECOCCGGGGATCCTCAGGCCTCAGGCCTCAGGTTCCTGATCCGGTACACCA1A_SACCGGGAATTCCATATGTTAGATTTTGAAAAACCACTACCA1B_SAAACATTCTAGATTCTCCTTATTCTATATAAGAACCGATATTTCTGACCD2A_SAAATAAGGAGAATCTAGAATGTTTAAAGATTTTTTTAATCGAACACCD2B_SACCGGCTCGAGTTATTTAGTCACCTCTTGATGGACCA1A_SPCCGGGAATTCCATATGAATATTGCAAAAATAGTCAGAGAAGACCA1B_SPGCCATTCTAGATTCTCCTTAGTATTTTCTAAATCGTTGATAGACCD2A_SPACTAAGGAGAATCTAGAATGGCTCTATTTAGTAAAAAAGATACCD2B_SPCCGGCTCGAGTCATCTAGGACTCCCTCCATGACCA1A_PAECCGGGAATTCCATATGAACCCGAACTTTCTTGATTTCACCA1B_PAECTCATTCTAGATTCTCCTTACGGCGCGCCGTAGCTCACCD2A_PAECGTAAGGAGAATCTAGAATGAGCAACTGGCTGGTAGACACCD2B_PAECCGGGGATCCTCATGCGGATACGGGGCTC Open table in a new tab The operon accDA amplified from the pyrrolidine dione-resistant B. subtilis strain was ectopically expressed behind the xylose-inducible promoter PxylA in B. subtilis 168, carrying a deletion of the accDA wild-type locus. The resulting strain was B. subtilis MH110. The applied primers and cloning strategy have been previously described for ectopic expression of the wild-type allele (32Haas M. Beyer D. Gahlmann R. Freiberg C. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).2 Metabolite Incorporation Assays—Cells of E. coli MG1655, exponentially growing to an A535 of 0.1 in DO medium (1.25 ml) supplemented with 2 μg/ml polymyxin B nonapeptide, were labeled with 7.5 kBq each of l-[U-14C]leucine (10.96 GBq/mmol), [U-14C]uridine (18.56 GBq/mmol), [2-14C]thymidine (2.22 Gbq/mmol), and N-acetyl-d-[1-14C]glucosamine (1.85 GBq/mmol), to monitor effects on translation, transcription, replication, and cell wall biosynthesis, respectively. After 5 min the test compound was added (defined as time point 0) to the cultures at various concentrations. Samples (0.1 ml) were taken in regular time intervals and precipitated with 6% perchloric acid in a multiscreen filter plate (Millipore, 0.45 μm). After washing the precipitates with 0.1 ml of ethanol, plates were dried and radioactivity was determined in a MicroBeta TriLux β-counter (Wallac). Phospholipid synthesis was determined by metabolic labeling of 0.1 ml of exponentially growing E. coli MG1655 cells at A535 of 0.1 with 370 kBq of [3H]acetate (189 GBq/mmol) in M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% glycerol and 2 μg/ml polymyxin B nonapeptide. At regular time intervals after addition of the test compound (time point 0) the cells were labeled for 10 min. Each labeling reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.6 ml of CHCl3/methanol (1:2). After phase separation with 0.2 ml of CHCl3 and 0.2 ml of H2O, the organic phase was recovered by centrifugation and washed three times each with 0.6 ml of 2 m KCl and 0.1 m sodium acetate. Radioactivity in aliquots of the organic phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The incorporation of [14C]malonyl-CoA into fatty acids was measured in cell extracts of E. coli MG1655. The cell extract generation and subsequent fatty acid synthesis assay, including saponification and extraction of fatty acids into hexane, was performed as described previously (37Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1833-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Enzyme Purification—E. coli strains containing plasmids pGF1, pS35, pS38, pS39, and pS47 were handled for protein overexpression as described previously (36Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified in a single step and under native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, QIAexpressionist manual). Changes in comparison to these instructions concerned the lysis and elution buffers, which were published previously (36Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified using bovine serum albumin as standard (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The purified proteins, which were >95% pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE, were stored at 4 °C. Biotin Carboxylase Assay—The activity of biotin carboxylase was measured by following the production of ADP using the coupling enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as described previously (39Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reaction was measured at room temperature in 384 microtiter plates using a mixture (60 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm biotin, 3 mm ATP, 8 mm KHCO3, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 3 units of pyruvate kinase. The reaction was started with various amounts of biotin carboxylase, and the oxidation of NADH was followed at 340 nm using Spectrafluor Plus (Tecan). Carboxyltransferase Assay—The carboxyltransferase activity was measured in the reverse direction using a spectrophotometric assay, in which the production of acetyl-CoA was coupled to the citrate synthase/malate dehydrogenase reaction cascade leading to NAD reduction (36Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 40Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Lane M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reaction was measured at room temperature in 384 microtiter plates using a mixture (60 μl) with 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm l-malate, 0.5 mm NAD, 0.06% bovine serum albumin, 6.8 units/ml (0.1 mg/ml) citrate synthase, 3.6 units/ml (0.07 mg/ml) malic dehydrogenase, biocytin, malonyl-CoA, and carboxyltransferase. The reduction of NAD was measured at 340 nm using Spectrafluor Plus (Tecan). The standard assay concentrations of the carboxyltransferase substrates biocytin and malonyl-CoA were 10 and 0.1 mm, respectively. In the case of E. coli and S. aureus enzymes, initial velocities were obtained by varying the substrate concentrations to determine maximum velocities and Michaelis constants. The data were calculated by non-linear regression of initial velocity values and substrate concentrations were fitted to Michaelis-Menten equations (36Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using GraphPad Prism software (version 3; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). E. coli ACC Assay—Extracts of E. coli BLR(DE3) cells carrying plasmid pMSD8 were prepared as described previously (19Davis M.S. Solbiati J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28593-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). ACC activity was assayed by the acetyl-CoA-dependent incorporation of 14CO2 from [14C]bicarbonate into the acid-stable product malonyl-CoA (19Davis M.S. Solbiati J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28593-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 41Harwood J.L. Walsh M.C. Walker K.A. Dey P.M. Harbone J.B. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. Academic Press, London1990: 96-110Google Scholar). Changes compared with the published assay concerned the total reaction volume of 25 μl, the concentration of 5 mm NaH14CO3 (0.3 μCi), and the amount of cell-free extract protein (0.02 mg). Rat Liver ACC Isolation and Assay—The isolation of rat liver ACC was performed similar to published protocols (42Thampy K.G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6447-6453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Tipper J.P. Witters L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 715: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Rat livers were freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 2 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5% protease inhibitor (Sigma), and 100 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatant fluid was incubated with immobilized monomeric avidin (Pierce) for 60 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the immobilized avidin was packed into a column and washed with 2–3 volumes of homogenization buffer. ACC was eluted with homogenization buffer containing 2 mm biotin. Inhibition of rat liver ACC was determined in 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm citrate, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm ATP, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Following preincubation of ACC with test compounds for 10 min, the reaction was started with 0.2 mm acetyl-CoA. After 90 min, the reaction was stopped with perchloric acid, neutralized with KHCO3, and malonyl-CoA synthesis was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography similar to Hosokawa et al. (44Hosokawa Y. Shimomura Y. Harris R.A. Ozawa T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CoA esters were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (C18 Nucleosil 120-3, Macherey & Nagel, Dueren, Germany) in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.0, with a gradient of 0–12% acetonitrile and detected by UV absorption at 254 nm. The peak area was determined for malonyl-CoA using an external standard, and inhibition by test compounds was quantified by percent reduction in malonyl-CoA. Enzyme Inhibition Studies—The initial velocity of the enzyme activities was determined in the presence of various concentrations of a test compound. IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data to a sigmoid dose-response equation using the GraphPad Prism software. The data for competitive and noncompetitive inhibition by CPD1 in the case of carboxyltransferase of E. coli were fitted to the following equations, respectively. v=Vm×A/(Km(1+I/Ki)+A) (Eq. 1) v=Vm×A/(Km(1+I/Ki)+A(1+I/Kii)) (Eq. 2) The reversibility of CPD1 binding to the carboxyltransferase of E. coli was examined by dilution experiments. The enzyme without inhibitor as well as together with 15 and 30 nm CPD1, respectively, was diluted several times. The initial reaction velocity was immediately measured, whereas the activities of the inhibitor-free enzyme dilutions additionally were measured in the presence of 15 and 30 nm CPD1, respectively. Antibiotic Susceptibility Tests—Microdilution MICs were determined against different bacterial strains in 96-well microtiter plates with growth medium containing serial dilutions (2-fold) of antibiotics. A starting inoculum of 1.0 × 105 colony forming units ml–1 derived from overnight cultures was used. S. pneumoniae cells were directly taken from colonies, grown overnight on Columbia agar plates with 5% sheep blood (BD Biosciences). The strains were aerobically incubated in Isosensitest medium at 37 °C, except S. pneumoniae, which was incubated at 37 °C in Brain Heart Infusion broth supplemented with 10% bovine serum using an anaerobic jar with AerocultC (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The MIC was the lowest concentration of drug that yielded no visible growth after incubation for 18–24hat37 °C. End points were determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm with microtiter plate reader EL312e (Bio-Tec Instruments). Isolation of Resistant Mutants—LB medium (3 ml) containing serial dilutions (2-fold) of the antibiotic was inoculated with overnight cultures of B. subtilis 168, S. aureus 133, and E. coli HN818, respectively (starting A600 = 0.01). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the culture with the highest antibiotic concentration, at which the cells reached the same optical density at 600 nm as the antibiotic-free culture, was used for inoculation of a novel series of antibiotic dilutions in LB medium. This procedure was repeated six times. The resistant cells then were plated on antibiotic-free LB agar plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C for isolation of single colonies. The obtained clones were tested for antibiotic susceptibility, to confirm their antibiotic resistance. Metabolite Incorporation and Other Technologies—We measured the effects of CPD1 on macromolecular syntheses in E. coli. The compound selectively inhibited incorporation of radioactively labeled acetate into chloroform/methanol-extractable phospholipids. In contrast, the incorporation of labeled thymidine, uridine, leucine, and N-acetylglucosamine into DNA, RNA, proteins, and murein, respectively, was not inhibited (Fig. 3). These data suggested phospholipid synthesis as the possible target area of CPD1. To narrow down the target candidates, we measured incorporation of malonyl-CoA into hexane-extractable fatty acids in the presence of the natural product. No effects up to 10 μm could be observed, whereas the FAS inhibitor cerulenin inhibited the incorporation by 83% (Fig. 4). We concluded that CPD1 probably inhibits the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is catalyzed by the key enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase.Fig. 4Incorporation of [14C]malonyl-CoA into fatty acids using cell extracts of E. coli MG1655 in the presence of various concentrations of CPD1 and cerulenin, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload"
https://openalex.org/W2113834570,"Dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) reduces body fat in animals and some humans. Here we show that trans-10, cis-12 CLA, but not cis-9, trans-11 CLA, when added to cultures of stromal vascular cells containing newly differentiated human adipocytes, caused a time-dependent decrease in triglyceride content, insulin-stimulated glucose and fatty acid uptake, incorporation into lipid, and oxidation compared with controls. In parallel, gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and many of its downstream targets were diminished by trans-10, cis-12 CLA, whereas leptin gene expression was increased. Prior to changes in gene expression and metabolism, trans-10, cis-12 CLA caused a robust and sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling. Furthermore, the trans-10, cis-12 CLA-mediated activation of MEK/ERK could be attenuated by pretreatment with U0126 and pertussis toxin. In parallel, pretreatment with U0126 blocked the ability of trans-10, cis-12 CLA to alter gene expression and attenuate glucose and fatty acid uptake of the cultures. Intriguingly, the induction by CLA of MEK/ERK signaling was linked to hypersecretion of adipocytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. Collectively, these data demonstrate for the first time that trans-10, cis-12 CLA decreases the triglyceride content of newly differentiated human adipocytes by inducing MEK/ERK signaling through the autocrine/paracrine actions of interleukins-6 and 8.

The two predominant isomers of CLA, which are found primarily in ruminant meats and milk products and commercial preparations, are cis-9, trans-11 CLA and trans-10, cis-12 CLA. Originally identified as potential anticarcinogenic compounds (1Ha Y. Grimm N. Pariza M. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 1881-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 2Belury M. J.

It has been clearly demonstrated that MAPK activation results in regulation of gene expression by phosphorylating a variety of transcription factors and altering their transcriptional efficiency in a variety of cell types (32Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Whitmarsh A.J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 320: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Importantly in adipocytes, both ERK and JNK can phosphorylate PPAR-γ, which results in repression of its transcriptional activation potential, and adipogenesis (33Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P.

TNF-α signaling has also been shown to repress PPAR-γ gene expression, which blocks adipogenic conversion and causes dedifferentiation of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Xing H. Northrop J.P. Grove J.R. Kilpatrick K.E. Su J.L. Ringold G.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2776-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERK activation in adipocytes has been linked to insulin resistance (37Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Onishi Y. Ono H. Abe M. Shojima N. Fukushima Y.

In addition to TNF-α, other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 and chemokines such as IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α have been shown to promote adipocyte delipidation and insulin resistance (39Suzawa M.

Based on these observations, we examined the role of MEK/ERK signaling and adipocytokines in the isomer-specific, TG-lowering actions of CLA. Here, we demonstrate that trans-10, cis-12 CLA activates ERK1/2, but not p38 or JNK MAPKs, unlike TNF-α, which activates all three MAPKs (24Ryden M. Dicker A. van Harmelen V. Hauner H. Brunnberg M. Perbeck L Lonnqvist F. Arner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1085-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The importance of CLA-induced ERK activation was demonstrated by the fact that pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 blocked the ability of CLA to alter gene expression and attenuate glucose and fatty acid (FA) uptake of the cultures. The novel delayed, yet sustained kinetics of ERK activation by CLA, and the involvement of a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), suggested that a secretory network must exist for CLA to activate ERK. Finally, using protein array technology, we have identified IL-6 and IL-8 as critical autocrine/paracrine regulators of CLA-induced ERK activation. Collectively, these studies demonstrate for the first time that trans-10, cis-12 CLA induces the expression and secretion of the proinflammatory adipocytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and through autocrine and paracrine networks, these mediators reduce human adipocyte TG content by activating MEK/ERK signaling.

SV cells isolated from single subjects were used in some experiments, and another set of pooled SV cells obtained from Zen Bio, Inc. representing six independent human donors was used in parallel.

https://openalex.org/W2018982114,"Homo- and hetero-oligomeric interactions between the transmembrane (TM) helices of integrin alpha and beta subunits may play an important role in integrin activation and clustering. As a first step to understanding these interactions, we used the TOXCAT assay to measure oligomerization of the wild-type alpha(IIb) TM helix and single-site TM domain mutants. TOXCAT measures the oligomerization of a chimeric protein containing a TM helix in the Escherichia coli inner membrane via the transcriptional activation of the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. We found the amount of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase induced by the wild-type alpha(IIb) TM helix was approximately half that induced by the strongly dimerizing TM helix of glycophorin A, confirming that the alpha(IIb) TM domain oligomerizes in biological membranes. Mutating each of the alpha(IIb) TM domain residues to either Ala, Leu, Ile, or Val revealed that a GXXXG motif mediates oligomerization. Further, we found that the residue preceding each glycine contributed to the oligomerization interface, as did the residue at position i + 4 after the second Gly of GXXXG. Thus, the sequence XXVGXXGGXXXLXX is critical for oligomerization of alpha(IIb) TM helix. These data were used to generate an atomic model of the alpha(IIb) homodimer, revealing a family of structures with right-handed crossing angles of 40 degrees to 60 degrees, consistent with a 4.0-residue periodicity, and with an interface rotated by 50 degrees relative to glycophorin A. Thus, although the alpha(IIb) TM helix makes use of the GXXXG framework, neighboring residues have evolved to engineer its dimerization interface, enabling it to subserve specific and specialized functions."
https://openalex.org/W2171728173,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) family ligands are derived by proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomains of integral membrane precursors. Previously, we established that tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) is a physiologic transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) sheddase, and we also demonstrated enhanced shedding of amphiregulin (AR) and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF upon restoration of TACE activity in TACE-deficient EC-2 fibroblasts. Here we extended these results by showing that purified soluble TACE cleaved single sites in the juxtamembrane stalks of mouse pro-HB-EGF and pro-AR ectodomains in vitro. For pro-HB-EGF, this site matched the C terminus of the purified human growth factor, and we speculate that the AR cleavage site is also physiologically relevant. In contrast, ADAM9 and -10, both implicated in HB-EGF shedding, failed to cleave the ectodomain or cleaved at a nonphysiologic site, respectively. Cotransfection of TACE in EC-2 cells enhanced phorbol myristate acetate-induced but not constitutive shedding of epiregulin and had no effect on betacellulin (BTC) processing. Additionally, soluble TACE did not cleave the juxtamembrane stalks of either pro-BTC or pro-epiregulin ectodomains in vitro. Substitution of the shorter pro-BTC juxtamembrane stalk or truncation of the pro-TGF-α stalk to match the pro-BTC length reduced TGF-α shedding from transfected cells to background levels, whereas substitution of the pro-BTC P2-P2′ sequence reduced TGF-α shedding less dramatically. Conversely, substitution of the pro-TGF-α stalk or lengthening of the pro-BTC stalk, especially when combined with substitution of the pro-TGF-α P2–P2′ sequence, markedly increased BTC shedding. These results indicate that efficient TACE cleavage is determined by a combination of stalk length and scissile bond sequence.

Members of this family share a distinctive disulfide-bonded 3-loop domain, the EGF-like motif, which is required for high affinity binding to the EGF receptor (EGFR). Soluble receptor ligands containing this EGF-like sequence are in each case released from integral membrane precursor proteins. The critical “C-terminal” cleavage events that are required for release occur within short juxtamembrane stalks that link the EGF-like motifs to the transmembrane (TM) domains. Additionally, variable cleavage at membrane distal sites (N-terminal cleavage) gives rise to larger soluble forms and could modulate the function of EGF family members. Whether both C- and N-terminal processing events are mediated by the same or different enzymes is presently unclear.

Fibroblasts, as well as primary keratinocytes, derived from these TACE-deficient mice, were dramatically impaired in their ability to shed TGF-α, whereas restoration of functional TACE enhanced processing (27Peschon J.J.

Collectively, these results established TACE as a major TGF-α sheddase, although TACE-deficient cells retain reduced ability to shed TGF-α, apparently because of the minor action of one or more other metalloproteases (32Merlos-Suarez A. Ruiz-Paz S. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48510-48517Google Scholar, 33Hinkle C.L. Mohan M.J. Lin P. Yeung N. Rasmussen F. Milla M.E. Moss M.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2127-2136Google Scholar). TACE-deficient mice die soon after birth, displaying epithelial defects in lung, small intestine, stomach, thyroid, parathyroid, and salivary glands (27Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Google Scholar). These defects are broadly similar to those observed in EGFR null mice, prompting speculation that TACE is a Pan-EGF family sheddase (27Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J.

Supporting this notion, TACE-deficient and HB-EGF-null mice displayed similarly defective cardiac valvulogenesis and poorly differentiated lungs (14Jackson L.F. Qiu T.H. Sunnarborg S.W. Chang A. Zhang C. Patterson C. Lee D.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2704-2716Google Scholar, 35Zhao J. Chen H. Peschon J.J. Shi W. Zhang Y. Frank S.J. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 204-218Google Scholar), and cotransfection of TACE with pro-AR and pro-HB-EGF increased the shedding of these growth factors from TACE-deficient fibroblasts (31Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Raska C.S. Peschon J.J. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12838-12845Google Scholar). In addition, application of TACE antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNA diminished AR shedding from lung (36Lemjabbar H. Li D. Gallup M. Sidhu S. Drori E. Basbaum C. J. Biol.

Arguing against a role for TACE as a Pan-EGF family convertase, EGF processing was shown to be metalloprotease-dependent, but TACE-independent (37Le Gall S. Auger R. Dreux C. Mauduit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45255-45268Google Scholar), and ADAM9 (38Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E.

Here we used cell-based and in vitro assays to examine further the role of TACE as a mediator of EGF family shedding. Our results support recent genetic evidence implicating TACE as a physiologic HB-EGF convertase, while arguing against roles for ADAM9 and -10, and they are also consistent with growing evidence that TACE is a major AR convertase. On the other hand, although TACE contributed to PMA-induced shedding of EPR, it did not affect constitutive release of either EPR or BTC, nor did it efficiently cleave the ectodomains of pro-BTC or pro-EPR in vitro. Through stalk domain swapping and mutagenesis experiments aimed at understanding TACE preference for pro-TGF-α versus pro-BTC, we found that in addition to scissile bond sequence, stalk length is a major determinant of which EGF family precursors are efficient TACE substrates. Materials—The antibodies used are as follows: monoclonal anti-HA.11 (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA), monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), polyclonal anti-human TGF-α (Sigma), and polyclonal anti-mouse BTC (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Roche Applied Science or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG affinity gel was obtained from Sigma, and the anti-HA affinity resin and peptide were from Roche Applied Science. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Nucleic Acids Core Facility. The QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to insert HA and FLAG epitopes and to construct EGF family ectodomains and juxtamembrane domain mutants per the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of Epitope-tagged Growth Factors—Murine cDNAs for the murine EGF ligands were epitope-tagged with HA and FLAG sequences (31Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in DMEM with 5% FBS and 1× nonessential amino acids and transfected by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For TAPI-2 experiments, cells were switched to complete media in the presence or absence of 50 μm TAPI-2 (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) after 24 h. After 24 h, conditioned media and cell lysates were harvested. For PMA experiments, cells were switched to complete media after 24 h. After 24 h, cells were washed with serum-free media and incubated in serum-free media in the presence and absence of 100 ng/ml PMA (Sigma) for 2 h (43Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P.

For each PMA experiment sample, media or lysate from three transfected 60-mm dishes were pooled and treated together. All media was concentrated on Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges (Waters) and lyophilized (44Sandgren E.P. Luetteke N.C. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Lee D.C. Cell. 1990; 61: 1121-1135Google Scholar). To collect lysates, cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 μm EDTA). Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Conditioned media and cell lysates (75 μg) were analyzed by Western blot (31Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M.

Sandwich ELISA—To quantitate nanogram levels of epitope-tagged growth factors, we developed a sandwich ELISA for TGF-α and BTC similarly to published protocols (45Nemzek J.A. Siddiqui J. Remick D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 255: 149-157Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well enzyme immunoassay/radioimmunoassay high binding plates (Corning Glass) were incubated with 10–15 μg/ml anti-HA overnight at room temperature. After each incubation, wells were washed three times with wash buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Wells were blocked in 2% BSA, 1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Media and lysate samples or standards (ligand ectodomains) were diluted in dilution buffer (2% FBS, 1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), added to wells in triplicate, and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Anti-growth factor antibodies diluted 1:100 (anti-TGF-α) or 1:200 (anti-BTC) in dilution buffer were added for 1.5 h at room temperature. Anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:10,000 in dilution buffer was added for 1 h at room temperature. Color substrate solution (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to wells and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. The color reaction was stopped by adding 1.5 n sulfuric acid and immediately read on a plate reader at 450 nm. Production of Ectodomain Ligands—Pro-TGF-ecto was generated previously (31Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Raska C.S. Peschon J.J. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12838-12845Google Scholar). Forward primers used for mutagenesis are as follows: ProARecto, 5′-GCGAGGATGACAAGGACCTATCCAAGGATTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATTGCC-3′; ProHB-EGFecto, 5′-CCTATACACATATGACCACACTGATTACAAGGACGACG-3′; Pro-BTCecto: 5′-GCAGGACCGGGGGCAGGATTACAAGGACGACG-3′; and Pro-EPRecto, 5′-CGTTGACAGTGATTCTCATTTTCGATTACAAGGACGACG-3′. To produce ectodomain proteins, cDNAs were transfected into COS-1 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, cells were placed in complete media (DMEM, 10% FBS) and cultured for an additional 24 h before conditioned media were collected. For pro-BT-Cecto and pro-EPRecto, conditioned media were concentrated as before (31Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Raska C.S. Peschon J.J. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12838-12845Google Scholar). For pro-ARecto and pro-HB-EGFecto, media were immunoprecipitated by using anti-HA affinity resin at 4 °C with tumbling for 24–48 h. Beads were washed with 20 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20), and bound proteins were eluted by using 1 mg of HA peptide in equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) at 37 °C with tumbling. To remove excess HA peptide, proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 16–18 h using Spectra-Por membrane (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA). The protein concentrations were assayed using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) and normalized for ectodomain proteins by comparison on Western blots. In Vitro Digests—Aliquots (1–10 μg) of ectodomain proteins were incubated with 150–300 μg/ml recombinant human TACE or ADAM9 or ADAM10 (R & D Systems) or 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (as indicated) (31Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Raska C.S. Peschon J.J. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12838-12845Google Scholar), for 1 or 24 h. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and products were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride, and probed with the indicated antibodies. For determination of N- and C-terminal cleavage sites, reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA, and products were immunoprecipitated by using M2 anti-FLAG affinity gel at 4 °C for 16–18 h. Beads were washed five times with fresh 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Molecular weights of cleavage products were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF-MS) using a Bruker Reflex III mass spectrometer (Bruker Instruments Co., Billerica, MA) optimized in the linear mode (46Raska C.S. Parker C.E. Sunnarborg S.W. Pope R.M. Lee D.C. Glish G.L. Borchers C.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 1076-1085Google Scholar, 47Papac D.I. Hoyes J. Tomer K.B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1485-1492Google Scholar), and recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) was used as the matrix. The α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solvent was 50:50:0.1 acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid and used as a saturated solution. A 0.5-μl aliquot of the settled beads was spotted on the target, followed by 0.5 μl of matrix solution, and the solution was allowed to dry at room temperature. Construction of Juxtamembrane Domain Mutants—Epitope-tagged pro-TGF-α (41Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Google Scholar) and pro-BTC cDNAs were used to construct juxtamembrane domain mutants. For the BTC-JMFYLQ-LAVV+2 mutant, sequential rounds of mutagenesis were performed using the BTC-JMFYLQ-LAVV and BTC-JM+2 primers. Forward primers used are as follows: TGF-JMBTC, 5′-GGTGTTCGCTGTGAGCGAGTGGACCTGTTTTACCTCCAGCAGGACCGGGGGCAGGCCATCACTGCCCTGG-3′; TGF-JMΔ2, 5′-GCTGCCAGCCAGAAGGCCATCACTGCCC-3′; TGF-JMLAVV-FYLQ, 5′-CGCTGTGAGCATGCAGACCTCTTTTACCTCCAGGCTGCCAGCCAGA AGAAGC-3′; BTC-JMTGF-, 5′-GGCTACTTTGGGGCTCGGTGTGAGCATGCAGACCTCCTGGCTGTGGTGGCTGCCAGCCAGAAGAAGCAAATCCTGGTGGTCTGCTTGATAGTGG-3′; BTC-JM+2, 5′-GCAGGACCGGGGGCAGAAGCAAATCCTGGTGGTCTGC-3′; and BTC-JMFYLQ-LAVV, 5′-GGTGTGAGCGAGTGGACCTGCTTGCCGTCGTGCAGGACCGGGG G-3′. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Biostatistics Facility using SAS statistical software, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for pairwise group comparisons. p values are exact and have been adjusted by using the Bonferroni method to allow multiple comparisons. TACE Does Not Enhance Shedding of Betacellulin or Epiregulin from Cells—We showed previously that cotransfection of TACE with TGF-α, AR, or HB-EGF enhanced shedding of these growth factors from TACE-deficient (EC-2) fibroblasts (31Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Raska C.S. Peschon J.J. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12838-12845Google Scholar). To assess the role of TACE in the shedding of two additional EGF family members, BTC and EPR, we generated epitope-tagged constructs encoding the precursors (Fig. 1A). As with pro-TGF-α (41Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Google Scholar), the HA epitope was inserted into the N-terminal portion of the EGF-like sequence, either three (BTC) or two (EPR) amino acids upstream of the first cysteine. In both cases, the FLAG epitope was inserted into the cytoplasmic domain of the precursor immediately preceding the penultimate amino acid. Tagged pro-BTC or pro-EPR were transfected into EC-2 fibroblasts, which lack functional TACE (43Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of TACE cDNA, and lysates and conditioned media were analyzed by Western blot by using HA and FLAG antibodies. Pro-TGF-α and empty pcDNA3 vector were transfected as positive and negative controls. As observed previously (31Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Raska C.S. Peschon J.J. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12838-12845Google Scholar), lysates of TGF-α-transfected EC-2 cells (43Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Google Scholar) contained 36- and 20–25-kDa species that were recognized by both anti-HA (Fig. 2A) and anti-FLAG (data not shown); the 36-kDa form is the fully glycosylated precursor, and the 20–25-kDa forms are immature glycoprotein precursors (41Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Google Scholar). FLAG, but not HA antibody, also recognized a minor 16-kDa species corresponding to the residual transmembrane (TM)/cytoplasmic domains of pro-TGF-α (Fig. 2A). Media from the transfected cells contained low levels of soluble HA-reactive 6- and 25-kDa proteins corresponding to mature TGF-α and larger fully glycosylated forms cleaved only at the C-terminal site (48Luetteke N.C. Michalopoulos G.K. Teixido J. Gilmore R. Massague J. Lee D.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6487-6494Google Scholar). High speed centrifugation of conditioned media confirmed that the 25-kDa protein was soluble and not membrane-associated (data not shown). In some experiments, the species appeared as closely s"
https://openalex.org/W2066744493,"The effect of a noncanonical Wnt, Wnt11, on canonical Wnt signaling stimulated by Wnt1 and activated forms of LRP5 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5), Dishevelled1 (Dvl1), and β-catenin was examined in NIH3T3 cells and P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. Wnt11 repressed Wnt1-mediated activation of LEF-1 reporter activity in both cell lines. However, Wnt11 was unable to inhibit canonical signaling activated by LRP5, Dvl1, or β-catenin in NIH3T3 cells, although it could in P19 cells. In addition, Wnt11-mediated inhibition of canonical signaling in NIH3T3 cells is ligand-specific; Wnt11 could effectively repress canonical signaling activated by Wnt1, Wnt3, or Wnt3a but not by Wnt7a or Wnt7b. Co-culture experiments with NIH3T3 cells showed that the co-expression of Wnt11 with Wnt1 was not an essential requirement for the inhibition, suggesting receptor competition as a possible mechanism. Moreover, in both cell types, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, which can result from Wnt11 treatment, led to the inhibition of canonical signaling. This result suggests that Wnt11 might not be able to signal in NIH3T3. Furthermore, P19 cells were found to express both endogenous canonical Wnts and Wnt11. Knockdown of Wnt11 expression using siRNA resulted in increased LEF-1 reporter activity, thus indicating that Wnt11-mediated suppression of canonical signaling exists in vivo.

The Wnt gene family encodes for a conserved class of secreted signaling molecules and is considered one of the major gene families essential for proper embryonic patterning and organo-genesis. Genome sequencing projects have revealed that a large number of Wnt genes exist, including 7 Wnt genes in Drosophila and at least 19 Wnt genes in humans. 1R. Nusse, www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html Wnt proteins function as growth factors and morphogens modulating cell growth and specifying cell fate. Early segment polarity screens in Drosophila resulted in the identification of key components of a “canonical” Wnt signaling pathway (2Nusslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Nature. 1980; 287: 795-801Google Scholar). Since then, extensive research on the canonical pathway has identified several genes, the gene products of which interact in a complex series of mechanisms that ultimately regulate the canonical pathway. At the cell surface, Wnt proteins activate the pathway through binding a receptor complex consisting of Frizzled, a seven transmembrane receptor, and its co-receptor LRP-5/6 2The abbreviations used are: LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; TCF, T cell factor; CamKII, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; DKK, Dickkopf; NLK, Nemo-like kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA.

Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Google Scholar). Intracellular mediators of the canonical pathway include Dishevelled and β-catenin (6Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 118-130Google Scholar, 7Noordermeer J. Klingensmith J. Perrimon N. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 367: 80-83Google Scholar), which promote pathway activation, and Axin and GSK-3β (8Nakamura T. Hamada F. Ishidate T. Anai K. Kawahara K. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 395-403Google Scholar, 9Siegfried E. Chou T.B. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1167-1179Google Scholar), which negatively regulate the pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligand, cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin protein remain low, as a result of its association with GSK-3β and Axin, which target it for proteolytic degradation (10Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Google Scholar). Upon Wnt ligand binding, GSK-3β is inhibited, and cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin protein increase (11Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Google Scholar) and subsequently translocate into the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator, commonly associating with members of the LEF/TCF family of transcription factors (12van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H. Cell. 1997; 88: 789-799Google Scholar, 13McKendry R. Hsu S.C.

Several assays now exist that demonstrate the ability of Wnt proteins to activate canonical signaling. Injection of Wnt or β-catenin mRNAs into the ventral marginal zone of four cell stage Xenopus embryos results in axis duplication (15Sokol S. Christian J.L. Moon R.T. Melton D.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 741-752Google Scholar). Wnt-induced protein stabilization of β-catenin can be detected by Western blotting (11Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Google Scholar). Also, a LEF/TCF reporter gene construct can be used to measure pathway activation (16Korinek V. Barker N. Willert K. Molenaar M. Roose J. Wagenaar G. Markman M. Lamers W. Destree O. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1248-1256Google Scholar). Collectively, these assays reveal that not all Wnt proteins can trigger activation of the canonical pathway. As a result, this gene family has been subdivided into at least two classes (17Du S.J. Purcell S.M. Christian J.L. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2625-2634Google Scholar). Members of the Wnt1 class (Wnt1, Wnt3, Wnt3a, Wnt7a, Wnt7b, Wnt8a) are effective activators of the canonical pathway, whereas members of the Wnt5a class (Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt11), with few exceptions (18He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Wang Y. Nathans J. Dawid I. Varmus H. Science. 1997; 275: 1652-1654Google Scholar), are poor activators of the canonical pathway. Signal transduction mechanisms triggered by the Wnt5a class are less understood than the more extensively researched canonical pathway. Embryonic studies in Xenopus and Zebrafish indicate that overexpression of Wnt5a results in an increased release of intracellular calcium (19Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Google Scholar). Wnt5a overexpression can also lead to increased activation of classical protein kinase C and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) (20Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Google Scholar, 21Kuhl M. Sheldahl L.C. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12701-12711Google Scholar), two calcium-responsive serine threonine kinases. Further support for a Wnt5a-calcium pathway comes from the analysis of different Frizzled receptors, which show that a specific subset can trigger increases in intracellular calcium (20Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Google Scholar, 21Kuhl M. Sheldahl L.C. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12701-12711Google Scholar). Also, recent work using the Δ Dix mutant of Dishevelled demonstrates its ability to increase intracellular calcium as well as to activate protein kinase C and CamKII (22Sheldahl L.C. Slusarski D.C. Pandur P. Miller J.R. Kuhl M. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 769-777Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that Wnt5a class members signal through Frizzled and Dishevelled, analogous to canonical, Wnt signaling, but resulting in an intracellular calcium release. There are multiple ways to inhibit Wnt canonical signaling. On the outer cell surface, there are at least four different gene families, the gene products of which have been shown to inhibit the canonical pathway. Specific members of the secreted Frizzled-related protein (sFRP) family, Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF), and Cerberus/DAN family are believed to inhibit Wnt signaling by directly binding to Wnt ligands (23Bell E. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Altmann C.R. Vonica A. Brivanlou A.H. Development. 2003; 130: 1381-1389Google Scholar, 24Hsieh J.C. Kodjabachian L. Rebbert M.L. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Dawid I.B. Nathans J. Nature. 1999; 398: 431-436Google Scholar, 25Rattner A. Hsieh J.C. Smallwood P.M. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2859-2863Google Scholar). Members of the Dickkopf (DKK) family, specifically DKK-1 and DKK-2, are also capable of inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling by targeting LRP5/6 at the receptor complex (26Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Google Scholar). There is evidence that members of the Wnt5a class can also inhibit canonical signaling. Early studies in Xenopus revealed that Wnt-triggered axis duplication could be blocked if mRNA from a member of the Wnt5a class was co-injected (27Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Google Scholar). Also, a recent microarray study identifies several canonical target genes up-regulated by Wnt1, which are repressed by Wnt5a (28Prieve M.G. Moon R.T. BMC. Dev. Biol. 2003; http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/3/2Google Scholar). How this inhibition occurs is not entirely understood. Although some studies provide evidence that members of the Wnt5a class repress canonical signaling at the transcriptional level (29Kuhl M. Geis K. Sheldahl L.C. Pukrop T. Moon R.T. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 61-76Google Scholar, 30Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo-Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 131-139Google Scholar), other reports suggest that inhibition may occur further upstream in the pathway (27Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Google Scholar, 31Gieseler K. Graba Y. Mariol M.C. Wilder E.L. Martinez-Arias A. Lemaire P. Pradel J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 123-131Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated Wnt11-mediated repression of the canonical pathway in NIH3T3 cells and P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. We show that Wnt11 can effectively inhibit canonical signaling in both cell lines and provide evidence for more than one inhibitory mechanism. Although Wnt11 can effectively inhibit downstream of β-catenin in P19 cells, it can only inhibit canonical signaling upstream of LRP5/6 in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting a novel inhibitory mechanism located at the cell surface. Further analysis of this mechanism in NIH3T3 cells reveals that Wnt11 can only repress a specific subset of Wnt1 class ligands efficiently. Cell mixing experiments with NIH3T3 cells show that the co-expression of Wnt11 with Wnt1 is not essential for inhibition and suggests receptor competition as one possible mechanism. We also show that P19 embryonic carcinoma cells not only have an active endogenous Wnt canonical pathway, but also signal through Wnt11. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Wnt11 results in increased LEF/TCF reporter activity, suggesting the presence of an endogenous Wnt5a class signaling pathway that can repress Wnt canonical signaling. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assays—NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. P19 embryonic carcinoma cells were maintained on gelatin-coated plates in MEM-α medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Various combinations of DNA constructs were transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE with Plus reagent as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Unless otherwise noted, 75 ng/well LEF-1 reporter, 25 ng/well of LEF1, and 100 ng/well of green fluorescent protein were added to every transfection, which was carried out in a 24-well dish. For NIH3T3 cells and P19 cells, LacZ expression plasmid was added to equalize the total amount of DNA per well (0.5 μg/well). Transfections were stopped after 3 h, and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity after 24 h (Roche Applied Science, luciferase assay kit). In brief, lysates were initially measured for green fluorescent protein fluorescence (transfection control) followed by the addition of luciferase substrate and then measured for luciferase luminescence in a Wallac multicounter. Luminescent intensity was normalized against fluorescent intensity. DNA concentrations were adjusted if significant differences were noted between normalized and non-normalized data. Experiments were carried out in duplicate and repeated twice to verify results. To quench endogenous Wnt signaling in P19 cells, Dkk-1 protein was added at the indicated concentrations after the transfection was stopped. Transfection studies utilized an N-terminal truncated form of mouse β-catenin, which was PCR-cloned using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with the following primers: 5′XbaI-TGTCTCTAGAGCAGATGTTGAAACATGCAG-3′ and 5′XhoI-CGTTCCTCGAGCAGGTCAGTATCAAACCA-3′ (no stop codon in frame with c-terminal hemagglutinin tag). To address the TAK1-NLK pathway as a mechanism of inhibition, we constructed an NLK phosphorylation mutant of LEF-1 as discussed previously (30Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo-Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 131-139Google Scholar) by switching T155A and S166A in mouse LEF1. A back-to-back PCR strategy was used to construct the LEF-1 mutant. After 15 cycles, 1 μl of a 50-μl reaction was added to a second reaction for seven more cycles, using the following primer sets: reaction 1, HindIII 5′-TCTCAAGCTTGCCACCATGCCCCAACTTTCCGGA-3′ and 5′-GCTCGTCGCTGTAGGTGATGAGAGGTGCTAGCGGGTGGA-3′, and reaction 2, HindIII primer and BamHI 5′-GTGGGATCCCGGAGCAAAGTGCTCGTCGCTGTAGGTGAT-3′. For cell mixing experiments, 24 h after transfection in a 24-well dish, cells were trypsinized, resuspended, and added in various combinations in a new 24-well dish and were assayed 24 h after mixing. Wnt11 siRNA Treatment—For siRNA transfection, control siRNA and Wnt11 siRNA (AACTGATGCGTCTACACAACA) were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and transfected into P19 cells in the presence of the LEF/TCF reporter using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent or Oligofectamine. To slow cell growth, P19 cells were grown in MEM-α containing 1% fetal calf serum and assayed 48 h after transfection. Western Analysis—For Western blotting, HEK 293T cells were transfected with Wnt3a-FLAG and Wnt11-FLAG at the indicated dosages. 24 h after transfection, total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. Super Signal (Pierce) horseradish peroxidase substrate was used to generate a chemiluminescent signal that was detected by a CCD camera. Suppression of Canonical Wnt1 Signaling by Wnt11 in NIH3T3 and P19 Cells—Previous work in Xenopus demonstrated that members of the Wnt5a class could block axis duplication if co-injected with members of the Wnt1 class (27Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of Wnt11 to block canonical signaling in NIH3T3 and P19 cells. The activation of the canonical signaling pathway by Wnt1 in both cell lines was evaluated using the LEF-1 reporter gene assay as described previously (32Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. McMahon E. Sussman D. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Google Scholar, 33Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Google Scholar). Analogous to studies in Xenopus with members of the Wnt5a class, co-transfection of Wnt11 inhibited Wnt1-mediated canonical pathway activation in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Although transfection of Wnt11, by itself, into NIH3T3 cells did not result in suppression of LEF-1 reporter activity (Fig. 1A), transfection of Wnt11 into P19 cells resulted in a significant reduction in LEF-1 reporter activity in the absence of Wnt1 (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that P19 cells may possess endogenous canonical signaling activity, which can be repressed by Wnt11 (Fig. 1B). Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of P19 cells with Dkk-1 protein also resulted in inhibition of reporter activity (Fig. 1C). This hypothesis is further supported by a previous finding showing that members of the Wnt1 class, including Wnt3, are endogenously expressed in P19 cells (34Smolich B.D. Papkoff J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 300-310Google Scholar). To determine whether Wnt11-mediated inhibition of canonical signaling exist in vivo, we utilized siRNA to suppress Wnt11, which is expressed endogenously in the P19 cells (data not shown). Co-transfection of the LEF-1 reporter gene in the presence of the siRNA targeting Wnt11, but not the control siRNA, led to increases in the reporter activity (Fig. 1D). We further demonstrated the effectiveness of siRNA-mediated knockdown by co-transfecting P19 cells with Wnt11 and the siRNAs. Wnt11 could only inhibit canonical signaling in the presence of the control siRNA (Fig. 1D). Wnt11 Represses Canonical Signaling through Multiple Mechanisms—To further understand how Wnt11 inhibits canonical signaling, we tested its ability to inhibit downstream components of the canonical pathway. Transfection studies in NIH3T3 cells showed that although Axin could inhibit activated forms of LRP5 (LRPC2) and Dishevelled1 (Myri-Dvl1), Wnt11 was unable to repress reporter activity activated by the activated forms of LRP5, Dvl1, or β-catenin (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that Wnt11-mediated inhibition of canonical signaling in 3T3 cells lies far upstream in the pathway, possibly at the cell surface. Analogous studies were carried out in P19 cells with a significantly different outcome. As mentioned previously, P19 cells retain endogenous levels of canonical signaling. Since the addition of any downstream activator would synergize with an already active pathway, the presence of endogenous canonical signaling initially complicated our attempts to demonstrate whether Wnt11 could block downstream pathway components. However, we could effectively quench endogenous signaling by adding purified Dkk-1 protein (Fig. 1C). Dkk-1 inhibits canonical signaling through binding to the LRP5/6 and Kremen1/2 proteins at the cell surface, where the receptor complex subsequently undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis (26Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Google Scholar, 35Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Google Scholar, 36Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B.M. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Google Scholar). Transfection studies carried out in the presence of Dkk-1 revealed that Wnt11 could effectively repress canonical signaling downstream of both Dvl1 and β-catenin (Fig. 2B). In addition, Wnt5a, another noncanonical Wnt class member, could also effectively down-regulate canonical signaling activated by Dvl1 and β-catenin in a manner comparable with Wnt11 (data not shown). To demonstrate the ability of Dkk-1 to quench endogenous signaling far upstream in the pathway, the expression of Wnt1 in the presence of the Dkk1 protein hardly resulted in further stimulation of the reporter activity (compare Fig. 1B with Fig. 2B). Therefore, it is evident that Wnt11 may inhibit the canonical pathway via more than one mechanism. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ Levels Inhibits Canonical Signaling in Both 3T3 and P19 Cells—Although signaling mechanisms of the noncanonical Wnt class are poorly understood, previous studies indicate that some of the noncanonical Wnts can trigger the intracellular release of calcium (19Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Google Scholar, 20Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Google Scholar, 21Kuhl M. Sheldahl L.C. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12701-12711Google Scholar). Furthermore, mediators of calcium signaling may be inhibitory to Wnt canonical signaling (29Kuhl M. Geis K. Sheldahl L.C. Pukrop T. Moon R.T. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 61-76Google Scholar, 37Li G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13254-13259Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous findings, increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration by treatment with ionomycin or by transfection with constitutively active Gαq (GqQ209L) in NIH3T3 cells and P19 cells led to the inhibition of the canonical pathway (Fig. 2, C and D). Interestingly, in NIH3T3 cells, the same treatments also led to the inhibition of canonical signaling activated by activated forms of LRP-5 and Dvl-1 (Fig. 2C), which could not be inhibited by Wnt11 (Fig. 2A). Therefore, although NIH3T3 cells may retain the essential intracellular components necessary for the calcium-mediated inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, Wnt11 does not seem to be able to activate these intracellular components in these cells. This further supports the idea that, in NIH3T3 cells, Wnt11 represses Wnt1 at the cell surface rather than through an intracellular signaling pathway The Cell Surface Mechanism Is Ligand-specific—The possibility that Wnt11 inhibits Wnt1-mediated activation of canonical signaling at the cell surface in NIH3T3 cells intrigued us. We wanted to examine whether there is specificity in the antagonism of canonical Wnts by Wnt11 and Wnt5a. The following canonical Wnts were tested: Wnt1, Wnt3, Wnt3a, Wnt7a, and Wnt7b, which all resulted in significant LEF/TCF reporter activation in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3A). We also tested Wnt8a, which could only activate LEF-1 in P19 cells (data not shown) but not in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3A). Co-transfection of Wnt11 or Wnt5a with Wnt1, Wnt3, or Wnt3a resulted in greater than 70% inhibition of canonical signaling, whereas co-transfection of Wnt8a with Wnt1 or Wnt3 resulted in less than 20% inhibition (Fig. 3, B and D). Interestingly, Wnt11 either poorly repressed or showed minor pathway stimulation when co-expressed with Wnt7a or Wnt7b (Fig. 3, C and D). When compared with Wnt1, Wnt3, and Wnt3a, Wnt5a also showed a reduced ability to inhibit Wnt7a and Wnt7b (Fig. 3, C and D). Surprisingly, Wnt8a substantially synergized with Wnt7a and Wnt7b to further activate LEF/TCF reporter activity (Fig. 3, C and D). To eliminate the possibility that Wnt11 or Wnt5a was being expressed at much higher levels than members of the canonical Wnts, resulting in nonspecific competition at the cell surface, we made FLAG-tagged versions of Wnt11 and Wnt3a and compared their expression levels. Both Wnt3a-FLAG and Wnt11-FLAG showed comparable levels of expression (Fig. 4A) with Wnt3a showing slightly higher expression. The biological activity of the FLAG-tagged Wnt proteins were then compared with nontagged ones; no significant differences were observed (Fig. 4B). Also, similarly to Wnt11, Wnt11-FLAG could not effectively repress canonical signaling mediated by Wnt7a (Fig. 4C). Unfortunately, FLAG-tagged versions of Wnt7a at either end of the protein were not functional, and therefore, were not included in these studies. Comparison of the ability of Wnt11 to repress Wnt3a versus Wnt7a by percent of inhibition (Fig. 4, B and C) further confirms our previous observation that inhibition appears to be ligand-specific. Wnt11-mediated Inhibition Does Not Require Its Coexpression with Canonical Wnts—Collectively, the data in NIH 3T3 cells suggested that an inhibitory mechanism existed at the cell surface. Therefore, we speculated that Wnt co-expression may result in either the formation of a nonfunctional multimeric ligand complex or competition for common receptor components. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we carried out a series of cell mixing coculture experiments. In the first coculture experiment (Fig. 5A, Scheme 1), two cell populations were mixed. One cell population co-expressed Wnts, whereas the other cell population was transfected with the reporter gene from which the response was measured. When these two cell populations were mixed, Wnt11 could still inhibit Wnt1 while having a mild stimulatory effect with Wnt7a (compare Fig. 5A (percent of inhibition) with Fig. 5B (percent of stimulation), white bars). In the second coculture experiment (Scheme 2), Wnt1 and Wnt11 were expressed in two distinct cell populations. Wnt11 was transfected into a cell population that was also transfected with the LEF-1 reporter gene. Under these conditions, Wnt11 still inhibited Wnt1 and moderately stimulated Wnt7a (compare Fig. 5A with Fig. 5B, black bars). Because the first scheme favors ligand oligomerization, whereas the second scheme favors receptor competition as a potential mechanism, comparing the two separate mixing experiments suggests that receptor competition may play a more significant role as a mechanism for Wnt11-mediated inhibition (87% inhibition versus 67%). Consistent with Scheme 2, the ability of Wnt3a-conditioned media to trigger canonical signaling in NIH3T3 cells expressing Wnt11 was substantially reduced (data not shown). In addition, when we switched Wnts and expressed the canonical Wnt in the same cell containing the LEF-1 reporter gene and Wnt11 in a separate cell population, Wnt11 was unable to demonstrate significant repression (data not shown). We also tested the ability of Wnt11 to repress canonical signaling under conditions in which three cell populations are mixed (Fig. 5, C and D, Scheme 3). In this scheme, Wnt1, Wnt11, and the LEF/TCF reporter are transfected into three separate cell populations. In these mixing experiments, Wnt11 or control transfected (LacZ) cells were added in either an equal number (one) or twice the number (two) of Wnt1 cells. Although we detected some inhibition with Wnt11, its ability to repress canonical signaling was substantially reduced when compared with Schemes 1 and 2. One likely reason for reduced inhibition with this scheme is that Wnt proteins normally stay highly associated with the cell surface and are poorly released into the media. Therefore, the function of Wnts is likely to be limited at the interfaces of producer and target cells. An increasing body of evidence suggests that members of the noncanonical Wnt class, Wnt11 and Wnt5a, can function as repressors of canonical Wnt signaling (27Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Google Scholar, 29Kuhl M. Geis K. Sheldahl L.C. Pukrop T. Moon R.T. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 61-76Google Scholar, 30Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo-Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 131-139Google Scholar). Work presented in this investigation further substantiates these previous findings. In addition, the results from this study indicate that there is more than one mechanism of repression by non-canonical Wnt proteins, as depicted in Fig. 6; one mechanism occurs extracellularly, and at least one occurs intracellularly. The Intracellular Mechanisms—Although the biochemical mechanisms by which Wnt5a class proteins inhibit canonical Wnt signaling are poorly understood, studies have indicated the existence of a Wnt5a class intracellular pathway that can repress canonical signaling far downstream at the transcriptional level (29Kuhl M. Geis K. Sheldahl L.C. Pukrop T. Moon R.T. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 61-76Google Scholar, 30Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo-Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 131-139Google Scholar). Consistent with those studies, we showed that Wnt11 and Wnt5a in P19 cells could repress canonical signaling activated by β-catenin, strongly implying that the inhibition occurs downstream of β-catenin and probably at the transcriptional level. How this transcriptional repression occurs is not entirely clear. Previous work on CamKII, a calcium-responsive serine threonine kinase, the activity of which increases upon Wnt5a signaling, showed that this kinase could phosphorylate LEF-1 in vitro, suggesting that it may be directly involved in transcriptional regulation (29Kuhl M. Geis K. Sheldahl L.C. Pukrop T. Moon R.T. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 61-76Google Scholar). Another study suggests that CamKII may activate the TAK1-NLK pathway (30Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo-Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 131-139Google Scholar), which has been shown previously to inhibit β-catenin-mediated activation of LEF-1 (38Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Google Scholar). However, we have been unable to demonstrate any significant effect on canonical Wnt signaling in either P19 cells or NIH3T3 cells using an activated form of CamKII or a pharmacological inhibitor of CamKII (KN-62) (data not shown). Furthermore, there were no differences in the ability of Wnt11 to repress canonical signaling in P19 cells when comparing the wild-type form of LEF-1 versus an NLK phosphorylation mutant, suggesting that Wnt11 does not utilize the TAK1-NLK pathway to inhibit canonical signaling (data not shown). Despite this, we do observe inhibition of canonical signaling by the activation of Ca2+ signaling via ionomycin treatment or the expression of activated Gαq. A previous study has shown that Gαq-induced repression of canonical signaling was calcium-mediated (37Li G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13254-13259Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional repression of Wnt canonical signaling, there is also evidence that the inhibition may occur upstream in the pathway. Early Xenopus embryo studies demonstrated that when members of the Wnt5a class were co-expressed with members of the Wnt1 class, axis duplication could be blocked. However, members of the Wnt5a class could not block axis duplication mediated through β-catenin or a kinase-dead form of GSK-3β (27Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Google Scholar). Similar studies with DWnt4, which has been shown to repress Wg signaling in Drosophila (39Gieseler K. Mariol M.C. Sagnier T. Graba Y. Pradel J. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1995; 318: 1101-1110Google Scholar), also suggest that inhibition does not occur at the transcription level but upstream of β-catenin (31Gieseler K. Graba Y. Mariol M.C. Wilder E.L. Martinez-Arias A. Lemaire P. Pradel J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 123-131Google Scholar). Our observation that the inhibition by ionomycin treatment or transfection with activated Gαq in NIH3T3 cells became progressively less effective with downstream pathway activators (Fig. 2C) also suggests that repression through calcium may target different points of the canonical Wnt pathway. The Extracellular Mechanism—In addition to the intracellular mechanisms, we also discovered that Wnt11 can inhibit canonical Wnts via an extracellular mechanism. This conclusion is mainly based on the finding that in NIH3T3 cells, although Wnt11 could effectively inhibit Wnt1-activated canonical signaling, it could not inhibit signaling activated by activated forms of LRP5, Dishevelled1, and β-catenin. Two additional pieces of evidence further support this conclusion. First, the activation of endogenous calcium signaling in NIH3T3 cells results in the inhibition of downstream pathway components, suggesting that Wnt11 is unable to trigger the release of intracellular calcium in these cells. Second, the Wnt11 inhibition of Wnt1 class members is selective. If Wnt11 targeted canonical pathway repression through an intracellular mechanism, it most likely would be common to all members of the Wnt1 class. What is the biochemical mechanism of repression at the cell surface? There are the following possibilities: 1) nonspecific aggregation of overexpressed Wnt proteins. Wnt proteins, which are cysteine-rich, glycosylated, and lipid-modified (40Burrus L.W. McMahon A.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 363-373Google Scholar, 41Smolich B.D. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Papkoff J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1267-1275Google Scholar, 42Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Google Scholar), can be highly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, most likely as misfolded protein aggregates (42Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of two Wnts in the same cell may cause a problem in either protein synthesis or the transport pathway, resulting in pathway repression. However, we feel that this is unlikely for four reasons. First, Wnt8a, a member of the Wnt1 class, which could not trigger pathway activation in NIH3T3 cells, had little to no effect on pathway inhibition. Second, Wnt11 is unable to repress Wnt7a or Wnt7b, demonstrating a ligand-specific nature to repression. Problems in protein synthesis or secretion, as a result of overexpression, most likely would not be so specific. Third, data obtained from various cell mixing coculture experiments indicate that co-expression is not essential for the inhibition. Last but not least, Wnt11-mediated suppression occurs in a nontransfected endogenous system. Suppression of endogenous Wnt11 expression by Wnt11-specific siRNA led to increases in canonical signaling (Fig. 1D). 2) Repression may occur through ligand oligomerization. Although Wnt proteins are active in their monomeric form (42Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Google Scholar), early studies have implied that Wnt proteins may form multimeric structures (40Burrus L.W. McMahon A.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 363-373Google Scholar). A hetero-oligomer ligand may not function well. We think that this is unlikely to be the major mechanism (see below). 3) Repression may occur through competition, most likely to receptors. Two different Wnts may compete for the same receptor components, although the ligands trigger two different pathways. One explanation for this may have to do with the multi-functional nature of Frizzled receptors. Genetic studies in Drosophila have shown that DFz1 and DFz2, which are developmentally redundant for canonical signaling, distinctly function in planar cell polarity (43Strapps W.R. Tomlinson A. Development. 2001; 128: 4829-4835Google Scholar, 44Shulman J.M. Perrimon N. Axelrod J.D. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 452-458Google Scholar) and cell motility, respectively (43Strapps W.R. Tomlinson A. Development. 2001; 128: 4829-4835Google Scholar, 45Cohen E.D. Mariol M.C. Wallace R.M. Weyers J. Kamberov Y.G. Pradel J. Wilder E.L. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 437-448Google Scholar). Because of this multifunctionality, the same Frizzled receptor may bind more than just one class of Wnt ligands. Consistent with this thinking, ligand-receptor binding studies in Drosophila indicate that although certain Wnts, such as DWnt8, are very selective in what Frizzled it binds, other Wnts, such as Wg, Dwnt2, and DWnt4, appear to be more promiscuous in their specificity for Frizzled proteins (46Wu C.H. Nusse R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41762-41769Google Scholar). The data from the coculture experiments suggest that the competition model may be the predominant mechanism, if not the sole one, for Wnt11-mediated inhibition of canonical Wnts in NIH3T3 cells. If oligomers were formed, it would have been more efficient for them to form when two Wnt proteins are coexpressed in the same cells. Thus, Wnt11 should have shown stronger inhibition in the scheme in which Wnt1 and W11 were coexpressed in the same cell population than the scheme in which Wnt11 was cotransfected with the reporter gene. In addition, as Wnt is usually membrane-associated, cells producing them would have better access to the Wnt proteins than cells that do not produce them. In fact, Wnt11 showed stronger inhibition in the scheme in which Wnt11 was cotransfected with the reporter gene, whereas Wnt11 showed little inhibition if it was expressed in a population different from the one expressing both Wnt1 and the reporter gene. Localized repression of the Wnt canonical pathway by members of the Wnt5a class is an essential part of embryonic development. Previous work in Xenopus implicated that both canonical signaling and Wnt5a class noncanonical signaling antagonistically control convergent extension (29Kuhl M. Geis K. Sheldahl L.C. Pukrop T. Moon R.T. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 61-76Google Scholar). Two recent studies, carried out in Zebrafish and mice, now provided genetic evidence that Wnt5a actively represses canonical signaling in vivo. Analysis of the Zebrafish Wnt5 mutant, pipetail, during dorsal/ventral axis specification and the Wnt5a-/-mouse during limb bud formation revealed ectopic activation of the canonical pathway (47Rauch G.J.

Saude L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C. Wilson S.W. Nature. 2000; 405: 76-81Google Scholar). Further confirming the antagonistic role of Wnt5a, patterning defects in the limb bud, as a result of Wnt5a disruption, could be partially rescued by transplanted cells expressing SFRP-2, a different type of secreted Wnt inhibitor (1Topol L. Jiang X. Choi H. Garrett-Beal L. Carolan P.J. Yang Y. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 899-908Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2137300854,"Notch and HOXB4 have been reported to expand hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro. However, their critical effector molecules remain undetermined. We found that the expression of c-myc, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, cyclin E, and E2F1 was induced or enhanced during Notch1- or HOXB4-induced self-renewal of murine HSCs. Since c-Myc can act as a primary regulator of G1/S transition, we examined whether c-Myc alone can induce self-renewal of HSCs. In culture with stem cell factor, FLT3 ligand, and IL-6, a 4-hydroxytamoxifen-inducible form of c-Myc (Myc/ERT) enabled murine Lin–Sca-1+ HSCs to proliferate with the surface phenotype compatible with HSCs for more than 28 days. c-Myc activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen augmented telomerase activities and increased the number of CFU-Mix about 2-fold in colony assays. Also, in reconstitution assays, HSCs expanded by c-Myc could reconstitute hematopoiesis for more than 6 months. As for the mechanism of c-myc induction by Notch1, we found that activated forms of Notch1 (NotchIC) and its downstream effector recombination signal-binding protein-J κ (RBP-VP16) can activate the c-myc promoter through the element between –195 bp and –161 bp by inducing the DNA-binding complex. Together, these results suggest that c-Myc can support self-renewal of HSCs as a downstream mediator of Notch and HOXB4."

Sam50 is essential for yeast cell viability under all growth conditions and related to the bacterial export component Omp85, suggesting that principles of the SAM pathway have been conserved from bacteria to mitochondria. The precursors of β-barrel proteins are first imported via the TOM complex, like all other nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S.

Sam35 is essential for cell viability and shows the characteristics of a peripheral outer membrane protein. Sam35 is needed for formation of an assembly intermediate of Tom40 at the SAM complex and thus plays a specific role in the biogenesis of mitochondrial β-barrel proteins. Yeast Strains—A triple HA tag (pYM2) (28Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) or a His10 tag (pFA-His10-HIS3MX6) (29Meisinger C. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Model K. Lim J.H. Sickmann A. Müller H. Meyer H.E. Wagner R.

For disruption of genomic SAM35 by homologous recombination, a DNA fragment containing sam35::ADE2 was transformed into the YPH499 strain carrying the 2μ URA3-containing plasmid YEp352 with the SAM35 ORF between the MET25 promoter and the CYC1 terminator, yielding sam35-delta (Mata, ade2-101, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, ura3-52, trp1-Δ63, lys2-801, sam35::ADE2, [YEp-SAM35]). The temperature-conditional yeast strain sam35-2 (Mata, ade2-101, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, ura3-52, trp1-Δ63, lys2-801, sam35::ADE2, [pFLfomp4-Ts5-2-CEN]) was generated by low fidelity PCR of the SAM35 ORF, followed by cloning through gap repair and subsequent plasmid shuffling of the sam35-2 mutant allele plasmid pFLfomp4-Ts5-2-CEN against the wild-type YEp-SAM35 plasmid in the sam35-delta strain according to published procedures (30Truscott K.N.

Yeast strains were grown at 24 or 30 °C in YPG medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, and 3% (v/v) glycerol) or YPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, and 2% (w/v) glucose). Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation and adjusted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) and stored at -80 °C. In Vitro Protein Import—Radiolabeled precursor proteins were generated by in vitro transcription, using SP6 RNA polymerase, and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences). Mitochondria in BSA buffer (3% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA, 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm methionine, 2 mm KH2PO4) were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min where indicated. The samples were transferred to 25 °C for 2 min and 2-5 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 mm creatine phosphate were added when required. To dissipate the membrane potential before import, 1 μm valinomycin was added. The import was started by addition of reticulocyte lysate (5-20% (v/v) of import reaction). After the indicated times, import was stopped by addition of 1 μm valinomycin, and samples were chilled on ice. Where indicated, mitochondria were treated with 5-50 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min on ice. After addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10-min incubation on ice, mitochondria were reisolated and washed with SEM buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitochondria were resuspended in Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE or in digitonin buffer (0.4-1% (w/v) digitonin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) for BN-PAGE (10Wiedemann N.

Radiolabeled proteins were detected by digital autoradiography (Amersham Biosciences). Miscellaneous—Isolation of the SAM complex via a protein A tag was performed by adaptation and scaling up of a described method (17Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B.

Isolation of the SAM complex via a His10 tag followed a described procedure (29Meisinger C. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Model K. Lim J.H. Sickmann A. Müller H. Meyer H.E. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2337-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: mitochondria were lysed in 1% digitonin; 0.5% digitonin was used in subsequent buffers; and 30-40 mm imidazole was used for washing. Sonication was performed as described previously (17Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48520-48523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). For treatment with carbonate, samples were incubated for 30 min on ice. For some figures, non-relevant gel lanes were excised digitally. Western transfers onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunodecoration were done according to standard techniques. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection (Amersham Biosciences). Sam35 Is a Peripheral Outer Membrane Protein—We scaled up the purification of the SAM complex from isolated S. cerevisiae mitochondria via a tagged Mas37, carrying protein A at the N terminus (17Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48520-48523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of a further protein, termed Sam35, besides the known subunits Mas37 and Sam50 (Fig. 1A). The new protein is encoded by the S. cerevisiae ORF YHR083w and is predicted to contain 329 amino acid residues without longer hydrophobic segments (Fig. 1B). Sam35 possesses homologues in Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces paradoxus, and Saccharomyces castellii and, via the proteins ADR303Wp of Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii, FG10106.1 of Gibberella zeae, AN0657.2 of Aspergillus nidulans, and SPAC589.04 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is related to mammalian metaxin 2. The function of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein metaxin 2 is unknown, yet it has been found by its similarity to and interaction with metaxin 1 (32Armstrong L.C. Saenz A.J. Bornstein P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Metaxin 1 shows a weak similarity to Mas37 and has been implicated to be involved in mitochondrial protein import (33Abdul K.M. Terada K. Yano M. Ryan M.T. Streimann I. Hoogenraad N.J. Mori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our finding that Sam35 is present in the SAM complex together with Mas37 raises the possibility that mammalian metaxins 1 and 2 may be involved in the biogenesis of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. We constructed a S. cerevisiae strain with an HA tag at the C terminus of Sam35. The resulting cells grew like wild-type yeast. Upon sonication of isolated mitochondria in the presence of salt, Sam35 was retained in the membrane fraction like the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) and Tim44, while the matrix protein Mge1 was released to the supernatant (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). When mitochondria were treated at alkaline pH, however, Sam35 was extracted from the membranes both under strong (pH 11.5) and mild conditions (pH 10.8) like the peripheral membrane protein Tim44 (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 8), while the integral membrane protein AAC remained in the membrane sheets (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 7). Thus Sam35 shows the typical characteristics of a peripheral membrane protein that is associated with the membrane via interaction with other membrane proteins. A treatment of isolated mitochondria with protease rapidly removed the Sam35 signal, indicating that at least the HA tag was degraded (Fig. 1D). Under the same conditions, Tim23 and Tim22 were not affected by the protease treatment (Fig. 1D). Since Tim23 is exposed to the intermembrane space, the outer membrane barrier remained intact during the protease treatment, indicating that Sam35 is exposed on the mitochondrial surface. To determine whether Sam35 is specifically associated with the SAM complex, we generated a yeast strain carrying a 10-histidine tag at the C terminus of Sam35. Mitochondria were isolated, lysed with digitonin, and subjected to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. The eluate contained Sam35 and Mas37 but neither Tom proteins, Tim proteins, nor the abundant membrane proteins porin and AAC (Fig. 1E, lane 6), demonstrating a specific association of Sam35 and Mas37. In an independent approach, digitonin-lysed mitochondria were separated by blue native electrophoresis (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 17Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48520-48523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Sam35 migrated in a distinct band, termed SAM core complex (Fig. 1F, lane 2). Its mobility was indistinguishable from Mas37 and Sam50 (in the latter case, a yeast strain carrying HA-tagged Sam50 was used (17Kozjak V. Wiedemann N. Milenkovic D. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48520-48523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar)), while the TOM complex showed a slower mobility (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results show that Sam35 is a peripheral outer membrane protein that represents a new subunit of the SAM complex. Sam35 Is Essential for Viability of Yeast Cells—Deletion of the SAM35 gene was lethal to yeast cells (34Niedenthal R. Riles L. Guldener U. Klein S. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1775-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). We generated yeast mutant cells by low fidelity PCR of the SAM35 ORF and plasmid shuffling. A mutant strain carrying the temperature-sensitive allele sam35-2 was selected. The sam35-2 cells grew like wild-type cells at 24-30 °C on both fermentable and non-fermentable medium but stopped growth at the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C (Fig. 2A). To minimize possible indirect effects of the sam35-2 mutation on cellular growth and mitochondrial function, the mutant cells were grown at the permissive temperature of 24 °C and mitochondria were isolated. The mutant mitochondria contained marker proteins for the outer membrane (Tom40, Tom22, porin) and inner membrane (AAC) in roughly similar amounts as wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 2B). The SAM core complex, analyzed by blue native electrophoresis and Western blotting with antibodies against Mas37, remained intact also after incubation of the mutant mitochondria at 37 °C (Fig. 2C). Sam35 Is Needed for Formation of a Tom40 Assembly Intermediate at the SAM Complex—To determine whether Sam35 was involved in the biogenesis of the precursor of Tom40, we induced the mutant phenotype by a preincubation of the mitochondria at 37 °C and imported the 35S-labeled precursor protein of Tom40. In wild-type mitochondria, the assembly pathway of Tom40 into the mature TOM complex of about 450 kDa involves two intermediates of 250 and 100 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2D, lanes 1-3) (10Wiedemann N.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In sam35-2 mitochondria, the assembly of Tom40 was blocked already at the level of intermediate I (Fig. 2D, lanes 4-6). The assembly intermediate I has been shown to be associated with Mas37 and Sam50 (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 18Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), indicating that it represented the SAM-intermediate of Tom40 biogenesis. To directly determine whether Sam35 was present in a functional SAM complex engaged in precursor binding, we used the method of antibody shift blue native electrophoresis (10Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schönfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 30Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Rehling P. Müller H. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Guiard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7780-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mitochondria carrying Sam35 with an HA tag were incubated with the radiolabeled precursor of Tom40 to generate the assembly intermediate I, followed by incubation with anti-HA antibodies and blue native electrophoresis. The antibodies efficiently shifted the assembly intermediate I to a high molecular weight range (Fig. 2E, lane 2). In a parallel reaction, the radiolabeled Tom40 was fully assembled into the mature TOM complex. Anti-HA antibodies did not shift the TOM complex (Fig. 2E, lane 4), demonstrating the specificity of the antibody shift and confirming the absence of Sam35 from the TOM complex. We conclude that Sam35 is a subunit of the active SAM complex. Specificity of Sam35 Function in Mitochondrial Protein Biogenesis—We studied the specificity of the role of Sam35 in mitochondrial protein import by analyzing the biogenesis of five different proteins. The assembly of the β-barrel protein porin (13Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) was strongly inhibited in sam35-2 mitochondria compared with wild-type mitochondria when both mitochondria were preincubated at 37 °C (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6 versus lanes 1-3). Without preincubation at 37 °C, porin assembly was similar in wild-type and mutant mitochondria (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-12), indicating that the mutant phenotype of sam35-2 mitochondria was selectively induced by the heat treatment. The outer membrane receptor Tom20, which contains a single transmembrane segment (4Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), efficiently assembled into the TOM complex in both wild-type and sam35-2 mitochondria (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the import of precursor proteins via the presequence pathway or the carrier pathway was not affected by the sam35-2 mutation (heat-shocked mitochondria), as shown with two cleavable preproteins, matrix F1-ATPase subunit β (Fig. 3C) and the Rieske Fe/S protein of the inner membrane bc1 complex (Fig. 3D), and the non-cleavable dicarboxylate carrier of the inner membrane (Fig. 3E). These results suggest a specific role of Sam35 in the biogenesis of β-barrel proteins and thus a genuine function in the SAM complex. Conclusions—Sam35 is a novel subunit of the SAM complex and is required for the assembly pathway of β-barrel proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The SAM complex contains two subunits that are essential for cell viability, Sam35 and Sam50, whereas only one subunit of the TOM complex, Tom40, is essential, emphasizing a crucial role of the SAM complex in mitochondrial biogenesis. While Sam50 and Tom40 are both integral outer membrane proteins with β-barrel structure, Sam35 shows the typical characteristics of a peripheral membrane protein exposed on the mitochondrial surface. Sam35 is present in the active SAM complex engaged in binding of the Tom40 precursor at an early assembly stage, and Sam50 is required at the same assembly stage I. We conclude that the generation of assembly intermediate I is of major importance in the biogenesis of Tom40, since it requires the functional cooperation of two topologically different, essential components. Sam35 and Mas37 are related to mammalian metaxins 2 and 1, respectively. Since it was reported that metaxin is required for tumor necrosis factor-induced cell death (35Wang X. Ono K. Kim S.O. Kravchenko V. Lin S.C. Han J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the role of mitochondria in apoptotic events (36Bernardi P. Petronilli V. di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 37Scheffler I.E. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 49: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) may also involve the SAM complex. We thank Drs. P. Rehling, A. Chacinska, and A. E. Frazier for discussion and experimental advice. We are grateful to B. Schönfisch and N. Zufall for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2157756800,"In C. elegans embryos, a Wnt/MAPK signaling pathway downregulates the TCF/LEF transcription factor POP-1, resulting in a lower nuclear level in signal-responsive cells compared to their sisters. Although the beta-catenin WRM-1 is required for POP-1 downregulation, a direct interaction between these two proteins does not seem to be required, as the beta-catenin-interacting domain of POP-1 is dispensable for both POP-1 downregulation and function in early embryos. We show here that WRM-1 downregulates POP-1 by promoting its phosphorylation by the MAP kinase LIT-1 and subsequent nuclear export via a 14-3-3 protein, PAR-5. In signal-responsive cells, we also detect a concurrent upregulation of nuclear LIT-1 that is dependent on Wnt/MAPK signaling. Our results suggest a model whereby Wnt/MAPK signaling downregulates POP-1 levels in responsive cells, in part by increasing nuclear LIT-1 levels, thereby increasing POP-1 phosphorylation and PAR-5-mediated nuclear export."
https://openalex.org/W2103268126,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-activated chloride channel that resides on the apical surface of epithelial cells. One unusual feature of this protein is that during biogenesis, ∼75% of wild type CFTR is degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradative (ERAD) pathway. Examining the biogenesis and structural instability of the molecule has been technically challenging due to the limited amount of CFTR expressed in epithelia. Consequently, investigators have employed heterologous overexpression systems. Based on recent results that epithelial specific factors regulate both CFTR biogenesis and function, we hypothesized that CFTR biogenesis in endogenous CFTR expressing epithelial cells may be more efficient. To test this, we compared CFTR biogenesis in two epithelial cell lines endogenously expressing CFTR (Calu-3 and T84) with two heterologous expression systems (COS-7 and HeLa). Consistent with previous reports, 20 and 35% of the newly synthesized CFTR were converted to maturely glycosylated CFTR in COS-7 and HeLa cells, respectively. In contrast, CFTR maturation was virtually 100% efficient in Calu-3 and T84 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasome had no effect on CFTR biogenesis in Calu-3 cells, whereas it stabilized the immature form of CFTR in HeLa cells. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR indicated that CFTR message levels are ∼4-fold lower in Calu-3 than HeLa cells, yet steady-state protein levels are comparable. Our results question the structural instability model of wild type CFTR and indicate that epithelial cells endogenously expressing CFTR efficiently process this protein to post-Golgi compartments.

Newly synthesized proteins entering the secretory pathway are carefully monitored by the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. quality control machinery to ensure that only correctly folded molecules exit and continue their journey to the cell surface. Misfolded membrane and secretory proteins are promptly recognized as such and degraded by the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD; reviewed in (1Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin.

Understanding this process is critical, since a number of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyrosis, and familial hypercholesterolemia are caused by protein folding defects that often arise from missense or deletion mutations (3Aridor M. Hannan L.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 836-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 4Aridor M. Hannan L.A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that many of these mutations result in the production of proteins that retain some biological activity, they are rapidly degraded by ERAD, preventing proper targeting of the proteins to their biologically relevant destinations (reviewed in Ref. 5Kim P.S. Arvan P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 173-202PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, inefficient protein biogenesis appears to occur even for “wild type” proteins, with a number of examples that include the epithelial sodium channels (6Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S.

Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins, including CFTR, are assembled in the cell membrane as part of a multiprotein complex (14Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

CFTR is a large transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two homologous halves, each containing six transmembrane segments (TMD1 and TMD2) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2), that are connected by a regulatory domain (16Riordan J.R.

Interestingly, even the wild type protein is substrate for ERAD, with as much as 75% being degraded by the proteasome during biogenesis (13Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W.

Since only a small fraction of newly synthesized wild type CFTR reaches the cell surface where it performs its biological function, the question has often arisen as to why CFTR biogenesis so inefficient. A study by Tector and Hartl (26Tector M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggested the possibility that transmembrane segment 6 in TMD1 is unstable due to 3 charged residues within this domain. Substitution of these residues with non-charged amino acids resulted in an increase in protein stability but a loss of chloride transport (26Tector M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that protein stability had been compromised for biological function. This hypothesis has not been evaluated in cells endogenously expressing CFTR. It has been suggested that an appropriate cellular context may be necessary to support proper membrane protein trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 27Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F192-F201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 28Bertrand C.A. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1-C18Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, it is possible that altered protein trafficking may result from the use of overexpression systems or non-physiological experimental conditions (reviewed in Bertrand et al. (28Bertrand C.A. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1-C18Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). Given that the initial studies of CFTR biogenesis were performed primarily in transfected, heterologous overexpression systems, a careful analysis of endogenous CFTR biogenesis both in the early (ER) and post-Golgi pathways is warranted. Heterologous systems may lack CFTR binding partners such as EBP50, syntaxin 1A, and CAL (15Sun F. Hug M.J. Lewarchik C.M. Yun C.H. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

In the present studies, we monitored the maturation efficiency of CFTR in two human epithelial cell lines that endogenously expresses CFTR, Calu-3 (34Shen B.Q. Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L493-L501PubMed Google Scholar), and T84 cells (35Cohn J.A. Nairn A.C. Marino C.R. Melhus O. Kole J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2340-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Metabolic pulse-chase analysis of CFTR in these cells grown under both nonpolarizing and polarizing conditions indicated that core glycosylated (Band B) CFTR is very efficiently (∼100%) processed to a maturely glycosylated (Band C) protein that is extremely stable. Moreover, quantitative cell surface biotinylation assays revealed that the CFTR surface pool is substantially elevated in Calu-3 cells compared with heterologous expression systems. Thus, endogenous CFTR maturation differs fundamentally from the patterns reported in recombinant overexpression systems, and these differences extend across multiple cellular compartments. Our findings cast doubt upon the viewpoint that wild type CFTR protein maturation is inefficient. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—COS-7, Calu-3, and T84 cells were obtained from the ATCC (www.atcc.org) and maintained in the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at University of Alabama at Birmingham. HeLa cells overexpressing wild type CFTR were transduced and selected as previously described (36Wu X. Wakefield J.K. Liu H. Xiao H. Kralovics R. Prchal J.T. Kappes J.C. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37Kappes J.C. Wu X. Wakefield J.K. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 76: 449-465PubMed Google Scholar), cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2. For cell monolayers, Calu-3 cells were seeded on 6.5- or 12-mm diameter Transwell filters (Corning-Costar, Corning, NY). After 2-3 days, the medium containing 10% FBS was exchanged to 2% FBS containing media, and cells were cultured for an additional 7-9 days with liquid both at the apical and the basolateral compartments. Under these conditions, the cells formed monolayers with trans-epithelial resistances of >800 Ω·cm2. Transient Transfection of COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured for 24-48 h before analysis as described previously (38Peter K. Varga K. Bebok Z. McNicholas-Bevensee C. Schwiebert L. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49952-49957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of CFTR—CFTR was immunoprecipitated using the 24-1 anti-C-terminal antibody (ATCC number HB-11947) (38Peter K. Varga K. Bebok Z. McNicholas-Bevensee C. Schwiebert L. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. Collawn J.F. J. Biol.

Labeled CFTR was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (39Bebök Z. Venglarik C.J. Panczel Z. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 44: C599-C607Crossref Google Scholar). Metabolic Pulse-Chase—One hour before addition of radiolabeled amino acids, the tissue culture medium was replaced with methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium. After 1 h of methionine starvation at 37 °C, 300 μCi/ml EasyTag Protein Labeling Mixture ([35S]methionine/cysteine, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added, and cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min (for the maturation studies) or 60 min (for protein half-life analysis). The radioactive medium was then exchanged with cold, complete medium and cultured for various chase periods. Cells were lysed at the time points indicated and CFTR was immunoprecipitated using the 24-1 monoclonal antibody and protein A+G-agarose (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (6% gels) and detected using autoradiography (PhosphorImager, Amersham Biosciences). Calculation of protein half-lives was performed as described by Straley et al. (1998) (40Straley K.S. Daugherty B.L. Aeder S.E. Hockenson A.L. Kim K. Green S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1683-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Maturation efficiency was measured by comparing the density of the labeled Band B to the density of the fully glycosylated band C using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.) as described previously (41Bebok Z. Varga K. Hicks J.K. Venglarik C.J. Kovacs T. Chen L. Hardiman K.M. Collawn J.F. Sorscher E.J. Matalon S. J. Biol.

Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface glycoproteins were biotinylated as described previously (38Peter K. Varga K. Bebok Z. McNicholas-Bevensee C. Schwiebert L. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49952-49957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Total CFTR and biotinylated CFTR was immunoprecipitated and in vitro phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and PKA catalytic subunit (Promega), separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected using autoradiography and PhorphorImager analysis as described previously (38Peter K. Varga K. Bebok Z. McNicholas-Bevensee C. Schwiebert L. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. Collawn J.F. J. Biol.

Biotinylation efficiency was tested by comparing transferrin receptor 125I binding assay with the biotinylated fraction of the transferrin receptor. The efficiency of the cell surface biotinylation in the experiments presented was 75 ± 4%. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from each filter using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was calculated based on the absorbance of samples at 260 nm. One tube from the RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) was used to amplify the CFTR mRNA using 1 ng of total RNA as templates. The primers were designed to anneal to two different exons (exon 10 and exon 11) to prevent possible amplification from genomic DNA and pre-mRNA. The sequences of the primers were 5′ ACTTCACTTCTAATGATGAT 3′(exon-10F1) and 5′ AAAACATCTAGGTATCCAA 3′(exon-11R). Two primers specific for GAPDH were used as controls for each sample (42Li J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10790-10794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed as instructed by manufacturer. The number of PCR cycles for this experiment was experimentally determined (28 cycles) to allow semiquantification of PCR products during the log-linear phase of amplification. RNA samples isolated from CFTR-negative HeLa cells were used as control to assure the specificity of the PCR product. The specificity of the GAPDH primers were previously tested (42Li J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10790-10794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Controls with no template or reverse transcriptase were also included. Experiments were repeated two times. Fluorescence-based Kinetic Real-time PCR—Isolated RNA samples were also analyzed by fluorescence-based kinetic real-time PCR using the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System as described previously for other genes (43Haslett J.N. Sanoudou D. Kho A.T. Bennett R.R. Greenberg S.A. Kohane I.S. Beggs A.H. Kunkel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15000-15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). One-step RT-PCR was performed on serial dilutions of RNA isolates using Master Mix Reagent kit and Assay-on-Demand Gene Expression Probes (Applied Biosystems, CFTR Assay ID: HS00357011_m1). 6-Carboxylfluorescein was chosen as reporter dye at the 5′-end of the probe and minor groove binder as the quencher at the 3′-end. The 5′ nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase cleaves the probe and generates a fluorescent signal proportional to the amount of starting target template. Each reporter signal is then divided by the fluorescence of an internal reference dye 5-carboxy-X-rhodamine, to normalize for non-PCR-related fluorescence. The TaqMan RT-PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 0.5 μl of RNA, 10 μl of TaqMan One-step RT-PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 μl of Multiscribe/RNase inhibitor, and 1 μl of 20× primer/probe set for CFTR and/or 18 S rRNA as endogenous control. Six 10-fold serial dilutions (100-10-6) of RNA samples isolated from the models cell lines were amplified in duplicates using CFTR and/or 18 S endogenous control. Data were exported from the ABI Prism 7900SDS software into Microsoft Excel where relative standard curves were plotted. Using the Excel Trendline option, a line of best fit was plotted. Data from each cell line were analyzed based on these standard curves and relative quantities were extrapolated. CFTR values were normalized to 18 S by dividing the CFTR values by the corresponding 18 S values from the same sample according to the Applied Biosystems relative quantification method. The specificity and quality of the primers is assured by ABI. Appropriate controls with no RNA, primers, or reverse transcriptase were included in each set of experiments. Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (41Bebok Z. Varga K. Hicks J.K. Venglarik C.J. Kovacs T. Chen L. Hardiman K.M. Collawn J.F. Sorscher E.J. Matalon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43041-43049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance among means was determined using the Student's t test (two samples). Calu-3 Cells Express High Levels of CFTR Compared with Heterologous Expression Systems—To compare CFTR biogenesis in heterologous versus endogenous expression systems, we first determined the relative amounts of CFTR in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, in HeLa cells stably expressing CFTR, and in cells that endogenously express CFTR, Calu-3 cells. COS-7 cells represent a common cell type that has been used extensively to study CFTR biogenesis (13Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E.

Physiol. 1999; 277: L700-L708PubMed Google Scholar) were selected based on their stable, high expression levels of wild type CFTR. To compare CFTR expression levels in the model cell lines, CFTR was immunoprecipitated from 250 μg of total cellular protein under standardized conditions. Relative amounts of CFTR expressed in each cell type were calculated based on densitometry and are shown in Fig. 1A. In COS-7 cells, CFTR expression levels are dependent upon transfection efficiency, while in HeLa and Calu-3 cells, the expression levels were consistently high. Since the relative expression level in Calu-3 cells was similar to HeLa cells stably expressing wild type CFTR, we selected Calu-3 cells for the initial analysis. The simplest explanation for high CFTR levels both in HeLa and Calu-3 cells is that they have similar CFTR mRNA levels, protein synthetic rates, and stability. To compare CFTR mRNA levels in HeLa and Calu-3 cells, we developed a semiquantitative RT-PCR using GAPDH as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 1B, while GAPDH message levels are similar, CFTR message levels are significantly higher in HeLa cells than in Calu-3 (in contrast to rather similar protein levels (Fig. 1A)). To further assess these differences, we also performed TaqMan Quantitative PCR (Fig. 1C). The results of the real-time experiments establish that CFTR message levels in HeLa cells are 3.5-fold higher than in Calu-3 cells. These findings imply that the high steady-state levels of CFTR in Calu-3 cells must be due to increased translational rate, increased maturation efficiency, extended protein half-life, or some combination of these effects. CFTR Maturation and Protein Stability Are Enhanced in Calu-3 Cells—To monitor CFTR maturation efficiency and protein half-life in Calu-3 cells and compare these values to previously reported results, we performed metabolic pulse-chase experiments and followed CFTR maturation in COS-7, HeLa, and Calu-3 cells. In these experiments, we compared the amount of the newly synthesized Band B CFTR and its conversion to the fully glycosylated Band C CFTR in each cell type. The results indicate that significantly more CFTR was synthesized in COS-7 and HeLa cells than in Calu-3 cells, as was first described by Cheng et al. (13Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). The conversion of the immaturely glycosylated CFTR to the maturely glycosylated form was extremely inefficient, with 27 ± 7.1% (mean ± S.D.; n = 7) maturation efficiency in COS-7 cells and 39 ± 5.1% (n = 11) in HeLa (Fig. 2A). In contrast, while the amount of the newly synthesized Band B form of CFTR was the lowest in Calu-3 cells, the maturation efficiency was 92.4 ± 8% (n = 11) after 4 h (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that although less CFTR was being produced in Calu-3 cells, the protein was processed much more efficiently to the mature form. Furthermore, comparing the total densities of Band B and Band C CFTR over the 4-h chase indicated that the total densities remain constant. This suggests that there is no early degradation, and all newly synthesized Band B is converted into Band C, and that the maturation only reaches maximum after 4 h of the pulse. To test whether increased CFTR maturation efficiency alone is responsible for high CFTR levels in Calu-3 cells, we determined the half-life of the fully glycosylated CFTR in each cell line. Using a more extended chase period in the metabolic labeling experiments, we found that CFTR half-lives were 10.8 ± 2.5 h (mean ± S.D.) in COS-7 cells, 12.3 ± 1.7 h in HeLa cells, and 22.0 ± 4.2 h in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 3). The results indicate that CFTR is more stable in Calu-3 cells compared with heterologous cells. Therefore, more efficient CFTR maturation and elongated protein half-lives contribute to the high steady state CFTR levels in these cells. ERAD of CFTR Is Insignificant in Calu-3 Cells—Early degradation of wild type CFTR by the proteasome has been described as a common feature of CFTR biogenesis (23Bebok Z. Mazzochi C. King S.A.

Because CFTR maturation approaches 100% efficiency in Calu-3 cells, we hypothesized that the disappearance of Band B CFTR in these cells is clearly the result of maturation and not degradation by the proteasome. To test this possibility, we compared the effects of two proteasome inhibitors (ALLN (50 μm) (48Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2027478659,"Crossover and noncrossover recombinants can form by two different pathways during meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The MER3 gene is known to affect selectively crossover, but not noncrossover, recombination. The Mer3 protein is a DNA helicase that unwinds duplex DNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction. To define the underlying molecular steps of meiotic recombination, we investigated the role of Mer3 helicase in DNA strand exchange promoted by Rad51 protein. We found that Mer3 helicase does not function as an initiator of DNA pairing events but, rather, it stimulates DNA heteroduplex extension in the 3′ → 5′ direction relative to the incoming (or displaced) single-stranded DNA. Conversely, Mer3 helicase blocks DNA heteroduplex extension in the 5′ → 3′ direction. Our results support the idea that Mer3 helicase stabilizes nascent joint molecules via DNA heteroduplex extension to permit capture of the second processed end of a double-stranded DNA break, a step which is required for crossover recombinant product formation."
https://openalex.org/W2081094927,"Human NDR1 (nuclear Dbf2-related) is a widely expressed nuclear serine-threonine kinase that has been implicated in cell proliferation and/or tumor progression. Here we present molecular characterization of the human NDR2 serine-threonine kinase, which shares ∼87% sequence identity with NDR1. <i>NDR2</i> is expressed in most human tissues with the highest expression in the thymus. In contrast to NDR1, NDR2 is excluded from the nucleus and exhibits a punctate cytoplasmic distribution. The differential localization of NDR1 and NDR2 suggests that each kinase may serve distinct functions. Thus, to identify proteins that interact with NDR1 or NDR2, epitope-tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated from Jurkat T-cells. Two uncharacterized proteins that are homologous to the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> kinase regulators Mob1 and Mob2 were identified. We demonstrate that NDR1 and NDR2 partially colocalize with human Mob2 in HeLa cells and confirm the NDR-Mob interactions in cell extracts. Interestingly, NDR1 and NDR2 form stable complexes with Mob2, and this association dramatically stimulates NDR1 and NDR2 catalytic activity. In summary, this work identifies a unique class of human kinase-activating subunits that may be functionally analagous to cyclins."
https://openalex.org/W2132660240,"We have demonstrated previously that new blood vessel formation induced by angiogenic growth factors in onplants placed on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chick embryos is critically dependent on the cleavage of fibrillar collagen by a previously unidentified interstitial collagenase. In the present study we have used a quantitative CAM angiogenesis system to search for and functionally characterize host avian collagenases responsible for the collagen remodeling associated with angiogenesis. Among the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) identified in the CAM onplant tissue, the chicken MMP-13 (chMMP-13) was the only enzyme whose induction and expression coincided with the onset of angiogenesis and blood vessel formation. The chMMP-13 cDNA has been cloned and recombinantly expressed. The chMMP-13 protein has been purified, characterized in vitro, and examined in situ in the CAM. MMP-13-positive cells appear in the CAM shortly after angiogenic stimulation and then accumulate in the collagen onplant tissue. Morphologically, the chMMP-13-containing cells appear as hematopoietic cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. In vitro, the chMMP-13 proenzyme is rapidly and efficiently activated through the urokinase plasminogen activator/plasminogen/plasmin cascade into a collagenase capable of cleaving native but not the (r/r) mutant collagenase-resistant collagen. Surprisingly, nanogram levels of purified chMMP-13 elicit an angiogenic response in the CAM onplants comparable with that induced by the angiogenic growth factors. The chMMP-13-mediated response was efficiently blocked by select protease inhibitors indicating that plasmin-activated chMMP-13 can function as an angiogenic factor in vivo. Altogether, the results of this study extend the physiological role of MMP-13, previously associated with cartilage/bone resorption, to the collagen remodeling involved in the angiogenic cascade.

Altogether, the results of this study extend the physiological role of MMP-13, previously associated with cartilage/bone resorption, to the collagen remodeling involved in the angiogenic cascade. Angiogenesis, the formation of new vasculature from preexisting vessels, involves extensive tissue remodeling (1Pepper M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1104-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Sprouting through the vascular basement membrane, proliferation and invasion into the surrounding tissue matrix, and coalescing of endothelial cells with other vascular tissue components to form tubular arrays all represent events that evoke the induction of proteolytic enzymes as contributors to such remodeling. The targeted substrates for the induced proteases would be the proteinaceous components of the vascular basement membrane and the extracellular matrix within the angiogenic tissue. The most dominant proteins in the vascular tissue milieu are the interstitial collagens. A number of non-collagen extracellular proteins also contribute to the architecture of vascular tissue, but these molecules (e.g. the adhesive glycoproteins), although functionally very significant, compositionally are often minor when compared with the collagens. Proteolytic remodeling of the structural collagen in vascular tissue would not be a straightforward catalytic event. Triple helical, fibrillar collagen is resistant to many proteolytic enzymes, including the potent digestive proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin and to plasmin, the major extracellular serine protease present in body fluids and tissues. Furthermore, among the members of an extensive family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ch, chicken; hu, human; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; wt, wild type; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; APMA, p-aminophenylmercuric acetate; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; r/r collagen, collagenase-resistant collagen. only a limited number can cleave the highly structured fibrillar collagens under physiological conditions (2Jeffrey J.J. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 15-42Google Scholar, 3Somerville R. Oblander S. Apte S. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 216.1-216.11Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This cleavage can be carried out by several soluble MMPs, including MMP-1 (collagenase-1), MMP-8 (collagenase-2), MMP-13 (collagenase-3), and possibly MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and by at least one member of the subfamily of membrane-anchored MMPs, MMP-14 (membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase). These enzymes are the main candidates that within vascular tissue could catalyze the initial cleavage in type I collagen, at the Gly775-Ile776 bond, causing a partial unfolding of the fibrillar collagen and thereby making it susceptible to the gelatinases and to other proteases in the vascular tissue. Thus it is likely that this initial and highly specific cleavage reaction would constitute a rate-limiting step in the remodeling of collagen-enriched tissues. In the case of invasive tumor cell remodeling of collagen-enriched tissue, recent studies (4Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 5Ellerbroek S.M. Wu Y.I. Overall C.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24833-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) indicate that MMP-14 is the major collagen-cleaving enzyme. In contrast, when dermal keratinocytes migrate through collagen, MMP-13 would appear to be the principal collagen-cleaving enzyme (6Netzel-Arnett S. Mitola D.J. Yamada S.S. Chrysovergis K.

However, it has not yet been clarified which specific collagen-cleaving MMP(s) might be the rate-limiting enzyme(s) in angiogenesis-linked tissue remodeling and which vascular-associated cell types produce the enzyme(s). By using a variety of in vitro angiogenic models, it has been shown that specific MMPs, in particular MMP-14 and MMP-2, are up-regulated in both endothelial and stromal cell cultures (1Pepper M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1104-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 7Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Clin.

In contrast, a number of in vivo studies using gene-depleted null mice have indicated that MMP-9 expression and activity correlate positively with the progression of angiogenesis (10Vu T.H.

However, MMP-9, although a potent gelatinase, is clearly not an interstitial collagenase (2Jeffrey J.J. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases.

Thus it would appear that additional in vivo studies are needed to evaluate the angiogenic involvement of specific collagenases. For in vivo modeling of angiogenesis, the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the developing chick embryo historically has been a frequently used model system (13Jain R.K. Schlenger K. Hockel M. Yuan F. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1203-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 14Auerbach R. Lewis R. Shinners B. Kubai L. Akhtar N. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). It provides an accessible, facile in vivo system to examine molecular events that occur during new blood vessel formation induced by angiogenic growth factors or tumors. The CAM system has implicated MMP-2 as one possible contributory proteolytic enzyme (9Fang J. Shing Y. Wiederschain D. Yan L. Butterfield C. Jackson G. Harper J. Tamvakopoulos G. Moses M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3884-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Brooks P.C. Aimes R.T. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5872-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) but mainly has been examined in the CAM as a potential modulator of specific integrins (15Brooks P.C.

Our laboratory has developed and utilized a quantitative CAM angiogenesis assay that involves placing select collagens onto the CAM in the absence or presence of angiogenic factors (16Seandel M. Noack-Kunnmann K. Zhu D. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Within 24 h various stromal cells, macrophage-like cells, and endothelial cells influx the collagen onplant from the underlying CAM, thereby expanding the vascular tissue. At the end point of the assay, only the new blood vessels that have formed in the collagen/CAM onplants are scored. It has been demonstrated that the new blood vessel formation in the CAM is MMP-dependent (16Seandel M. Noack-Kunnmann K. Zhu D. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the use in this assay of a specific, collagenase-resistant, mutant collagen (r/r) has implicated an undefined interstitial collagenase as the rate-limiting angiogenic MMP (16Seandel M. Noack-Kunnmann K. Zhu D. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used the CAM angiogenesis system to screen for host avian collagenases responsible for the collagen cleavage and remodeling associated with new blood vessel formation. We have identified chicken MMP-13 (chMMP-13), induced in the CAM angiogenic onplants, as a likely candidate. The chMMP-13 cDNA has been cloned from the total RNA isolated from the onplant tissue and recombinantly expressed. The chMMP-13 protein has been purified, characterized in vitro, and then examined in situ in the CAM and in other chick tissues. We demonstrate that the chMMP-13 zymogen is rapidly and efficiently activated into an interstitial collagen-cleaving enzyme by the uPA/plasminogen cascade. Moreover, purified chMMP-13, when added at nanogram levels onto the CAM, can function directly as a stimulator of new blood vessel formation. CAM Angiogenesis Assay—Angiogenesis assays were performed as described previously (16Seandel M. Noack-Kunnmann K. Zhu D. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs were received from SPAFAS (North Franklin, CT) and incubated in a humidified incubator at 38 °C. At day 4, eggshells were carefully removed, and embryos were incubated throughout the length of the experiment under shell-less conditions, in a covered dish placed in a humidified air incubator at 38 °C and 60% humidity. Onplants were generated by overlaying two gridded plastic meshes and embedding them into 30 μl of 1.6 mg/ml collagen of different types and origin. Where indicated, collagen was supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) at 16.7 μg/ml and VEGF at 5 μg/ml (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Collagen onplants were placed on the CAM of 10-day-old shell-less embryos. Test proteins or reagents were incorporated into the onplants at the concentrations indicated in the text. Onplant-bearing embryos were incubated for an additional 66 h at which time the extent of onplant vascularization was quantified. Newly formed vessels were identified by analyzing the upper plane of the onplant with a dissecting microscope (i.e. scoring only those vessels that sprouted up from the CAM and reached the plane of the upper mesh). The angiogenic index of the onplant tissue was determined as the percentage of grids that contained newly formed blood vessels from the total number of grids in the upper mesh. Data were processed using Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad Software Inc. San Diego). Statistical significance was estimated with the Mann-Whitney test. To facilitate angiogenic scoring in some experiments, 100 μl of india ink were injected intravenously to visually enhance the appearance of the vasculature. Images were taken at ×6.3 by using a digital video camera mounted on an Olympus SZ60 dissecting microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY). Immunohistochemistry and Histology—Onplants and embryo tissues were collected immediately after scoring, fixed in 10% zinc formalin, and paraffin-embedded. 4-6-μm-thick sections were deparaffinized and processed either for histological or immunohistochemical analyses. For routine histology, the sections were stained with Gills III hematoxylin and eosin. Giemsa-based dyes were used to discriminate the cells of hematopoietic origin. For immunohistochemistry, the chMMP-13 antigen was retrieved by heating the sections in 0.01 m citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 5 min in a microwave oven. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were subsequently probed with a polyclonal huMMP-13-specific antibody (Triple Point Biologics Inc., Forest Grove, OR), which is directed to the highly conserved hinge domain of the enzyme and cross-reacts with chMMP-13. Bound MMP-13 antibody was visualized with the chromogen diaminobenzidine, resulting in dark brown staining. Counterstaining was performed with Gills III hematoxylin. Images were taken using a DVC digital camera mounted on an Olympus BX60 microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY) and processed with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Seattle, WA) and Macromedia Freehand software (Macromedia Inc., San Francisco). RNA Isolation—RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using either Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) or RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturers' instructions. RNA was suspended in RNase-free water and stored at -80 °C. Screening for Expression of chMMPs in the CAM Angiogenic Tissue—The full-length sequence of the chMMP-13 cDNA was determined by using a combination of gene family PCR (17Aimes R.T. French D.L. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), gene-specific primers, and 5′-RACE. Collagen onplants were dissected from the CAM and snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was purified from the onplants, and 1 mg of RNA was reverse-transcribed to first strand cDNA with random hexamer primers. After cDNA synthesis, the PCR was carried out with degenerate primers from the two most conserved domains found in MMPs: the Cys-switch and the zinc-binding regions. The forward primer was 5′-AGCCIMGITGYGGIRWICCIGA-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-GATGICCIADYTCRTGIRCIGCIAC-3′ (I = deoxyinosine, Y = C + T, R = A + G). The reaction was cycled at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 1-min cycles at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 40 °C for annealing, and 2 min at 72 °C for elongation. The PCR products were cloned into pCR4-Topo vector. Those clones containing an insert of ∼450 bp were sequenced. Cloning of chMMP-13 Full-length cDNA—The 5′ 279-bp fragment coding for the first 93 amino acids of the chMMP-13 cDNA was cloned using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, mRNA was purified from FGF-treated chick embryonic fibroblasts and then reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 1.5 h primed with SMART II oligonucleotides and 5′ coding sequences. The first strand cDNA was subjected to touch-down PCR by using universal primers provided in the kit and gene-specific primer 5′-AAGTTCTGCTTCAACCATCTGCGGG-3′. The PCR was carried out under the following cycling conditions: 5 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 3 min, followed by 27 cycles 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. This reaction yielded a 1-kb fragment that was cloned into pCR4-Topo vector and sequenced. RT-PCR—Reverse transcription was performed on 4-μg samples of total RNA using SuperScriptII kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed with specific primers for chMMP-13 (sense, 5′-GGTCAGATGATTCTAGAGGGT-3′ and antisense, 5′-CAACTATGTCATAGCCATTCATAG-3′, which generated a fragment of 469 bp), chicken GAPDH (sense, 5′-GAGGAAAGGTCGCCTGGTGGATCG-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGTGAGGACAAGCAGTGAGGAACG-3′, which produced a 300-bp fragment), chicken MMP-16 (sense, 5′-AGAATCACCCCAGGGAGCCTTTGT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GATCTCACCCACTCTTGCATAGAGCGT-3′, which generated a 372-bp product), and chicken MMP-2 (sense, 5′-TGTGGTAACCCCGATGTGGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-ATCGCATGGCCAAATTCGTGG-3′, which generated a 923-bp fragment). The PCR was performed at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C for denaturation, 30 s at 60 °C for annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for elongation. PCR samples were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The intensity of chMMP-13, chMMP-2, and chGAPDH bands was determined by densitometric scanning, and analysis was performed on AlphaImager 3.3 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Expression of Recombinant chMMP-13 Protein—The cDNA containing the entire coding sequence for chMMP-13 was cloned into the expression vector pEE12 and used to transfect the murine myeloma cell line NS0 as described (18Bebbington C.R. Renner G. Thomson S. King D. Abrams D. Yarranton G.T. BioTechnology. 1992; 10: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Wells containing NSO cells expressing the chMMP-13 protein were identified by using gelatin and casein zymography of conditioned medium, and then cell lines were isolated and cloned by limiting dilution. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—For isolating recombinant chMMP-13, serum-free conditioned medium from NS0 cell clones expressing chMMP-13 was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2 buffer and then applied to a UnoS column, equilibrated with the same buffer, and attached to a Biologic DuoFlow FPLC system (Bio-Rad). Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in the same buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and zymography. Chicken MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-2 were purified as described previously (12Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol.

Collagenase Assays—Assays for the cleavage of native, acid-soluble collagens by specific MMPs were performed essentially as described (12Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, collagens were solubilized in 10 mm acetic acid and diluted to the indicated concentrations in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35 buffer (calcium assay buffer). Individual MMPs or organomecurial p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) was added to collagen mixtures at the concentrations indicated in the text. Reactions were performed at 23 °C to maintain the native triple helical collagen status and then terminated by the addition of 10× reducing SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed for specific collagen cleavage by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Zymography—Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were detected in the gels by either Coomassie Blue R-250 or silver staining (21Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml primary MMP-13 polyclonal antibody (Triple Point Biologics Inc., Forest Grove, OR), washed four times with PBST, incubated for 1 or 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) diluted at 1:2,500 in PBST, 5% milk, and developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Casein (0.67 mg/ml) and gelatin (0.28 mg/ml) zymography was performed on 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels as described (12Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5872-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100, incubated overnight at 37 °C in calcium assay buffer, and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Activation of chMMP-13 Zymogen by Plasmin—Chicken plasmin was generated by incubation of purified plasminogen (2.5 μm) with recombinant uPA (5% conditioned medium from HeLa cells transfected with the chicken uPA cDNA) in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 (TTX buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, aprotinin was added at a final concentration of 10 μm to block the activity of generated plasmin. To analyze whether plasminogen or uPA alone could induce chMMP-13 activation, these proteins were preincubated individually and thereafter mixed with the chMMP-13 proenzyme. The chMMP-13 zymogen was added at 33 nm to each of reaction mixtures, which were further incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time intervals, the reaction was stopped with ×10 SDS sample buffer. Proteins from 20-μl aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels under nonreducing conditions, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with 1 μg/ml anti-MMP-13 rabbit antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and MMP-13 bands were visualized by ECL. To determine the actual amount of plasmin generated from 2.5 μm plasminogen upon incubation with recombinant chuPA, a standardized assay for plasmin-mediated cleavage of a specific tripeptide substrate was employed. The plasmin substrate S2251 (American Diagnostics, Greenwich, CT) was incubated with serial dilutions of purified human plasmin (1.5-100 nm), and S2251 cleavage was monitored during a 1-h incubation at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. In parallel, aliquots of the chicken plasminogen/uPA incubation mixture were serially diluted and similarly assayed with the plasmin substrate S2251. The concentration of plasmin in the incubation mixture was then determined based on a kinetic analysis of the ensuing cleavage reaction compared with the standardized cleavage reaction with purified plasmin. The analysis confirmed that chuPA was the rate-limiting factor in conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, yielding ∼10-25 nm of plasmin from 2.5 μm chicken plasminogen. In addition, it was also determined that at a concentration as low as 2 nm, purified human uPA was capable of generating 1 nm plasmin from 250 μm of human plasminogen (data not shown), indicating that the chicken uPA/plasminogen cascade operates at a similar efficiency in generating plasmin as the human uPA/plasminogen cascade. Collagenolytic Activity of the Plasmin-activated chMMP-13 Enzyme—The chMMP-13 zymogen was activated by plasmin as described above. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, aprotinin was added at 10 μm to all reaction mixtures to block any residual collagenolytic activity of plasmin or plasmin-generating reagents. Where indicated, recombinant chTIMP-2 was added at a stoichiometric concentration of 33 nm to inhibit proteolytic activity of the generated chMMP-13 enzyme. The collagenolytic ability of the plasmin-activated chMMP-13 was assessed by the 3/4—1/4 cleavage of type I collagen. A 20-μl aliquot of the above described reagent mixtures was mixed with 20 μg of type I rat collagen in 30 μl of calcium assay buffer and incubated for 18 h at 23 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, and protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. MMP-13 Expression in the Chicken CAM Correlates with Growth Factor-induced Angiogenesis—A quantitative method for scoring new blood vessel formation in the chick embryo was used to examine the involvement of specific MMPs in angiogenesis. The method involves placement of collagen-enmeshed grids on the CAM and then scoring for the newly formed blood vessels that distinctly appear in the upper grids of the collagen onplant (see Ref. 16Seandel M. Noack-Kunnmann K. Zhu D. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and “Materials and Methods”). The development of functional, blood-bearing vessels in the collagen onplants was stimulated by the addition of the angiogenic growth factors FGF and VEGF. The number of grids containing newly formed blood vessels increased 5-10-fold in the presence of FGF/VEGF as compared with control conditions lacking exogenous angiogenic factors (Fig. 1A). This growth factor-induced blood vessel formation was inhibited almost completely by purified chTIMP-2 (Fig. 1A). In conjunction with the reported sensitivity of CAM angiogenesis to synthetic broad spectrum MMP inhibitors (16Seandel M. Noack-Kunnmann K. Zhu D. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the latter result with a natural MMP inhibitor strongly indicated an involvement of avian MMP(s) in the formation of new vessels in the CAM. Moreover, CAM angiogenesis was substantially reduced when the normal wild type (wt) collagen in the onplants was substituted with a collagenase-resistant mutant (r/r) collagen (Fig. 1A). This finding suggests that during angiogenesis, one of the rate-limiting MMPs is an interstitial collagenase that specifically cleaves wt collagen at the site mutated in the r/r collagen. To identify potential MMP candidates, the temporal expression of various chicken MMPs was examined in both control and growth factor-containing onplants. Total RNA was extracted from the CAM onplants at 15 h (before any new blood vessels have formed), at 45 h (when new vessels have begun to sprout), and at 66 h (the peak of new vessel formation) (16Seandel M. Noack-Kunnmann K. Zhu D. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The RNA was reverse-transcribed and subjected to PCR analysis by using degenerate primers targeting the two most conservative domains found in MMPs, the cysteine switch and zinc-binding regions. The chicken MMP-1, -8, and 14 mRNAs were not detected in the CAM extracts. In contrast, the mRNA for chMMP-2 (gelatinase A), chMMP-13 (collagenase-3), and chMMP-16 (MT3-MMP) were readily detected. However, mRNA expression levels of chMMP-2 and chMMP-16 were not affected by the angiogenic growth factors and did not correlate with the kinetics of C"

Cytokine expression array experiments showed that exposure of the cells to flagellin (100 ng/ml) for 12 h increased the expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and macrophage-inflammatory protein 3α (MIP3α) in a TLR5-specific manner. Flagellin also activated MAP kinases (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38) and degraded IκBα. Dominant negative MEK1 (a kinase that activates ERK1/2) blocked flagellin-stimulated IL-8 and MIP3α transcriptional activity, while the MEK-specific inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 reduced protein production of these cytokines. Conversely, transfection with a constitutively active MEK1 increased IL-8 and MIP3α transcriptional activity in a NFκB-independent manner. Furthermore, overexpression of the constitutively active MEK1 induced IL-8 and MIP3α protein production.

https://openalex.org/W1967020388,"The mosquito midgut ookinete stage of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, possesses microneme secretory organelles that mediate locomotion and midgut wall egress to establish sporogonic stages and subsequent transmission. The purpose of this study was 2-fold: 1) to determine whether there exists a single micronemal population with respect to soluble and membrane-associated secreted proteins; and 2) to evaluate the ookinete micronemal proteins chitinase (PgCHT1), circumsporozoite and TRAP-related protein (CTRP), and von Willebrand factor A domain-related protein (WARP) as immunological targets eliciting sera-blocking malaria parasite infectivity to mosquitoes. Indirect immunofluorescence localization studies in Plasmodium gallinaceum using specific antisera showed that all three proteins are distributed intracellularly with a similar granular cytoplasmic appearance and with focal concentration of PgCHT1 and PgCTRP, but not PgWARP, at the ookinete apical end. Immunogold double-labeling electron microscopy, using antisera against the membrane-associated protein CTRP and the soluble WARP, showed that these two proteins co-localized to the same micronemal population. Within the microneme CTRP was associated peripherally at the microneme membrane, whereas PgCHT1 and WARP were diffuse within the micronemal lumen. Sera produced against Plasmodium falciparum WARP significantly reduced the infectivity of P. gallinaceum to Aedes aegypti and P. falciparum to Anopheles mosquitoes. Antisera against PgCTRP and PgCHT1 also significantly reduced the infectivity of P. gallinaceum for A. aegypti. These results support the concept that ookinete micronemal proteins may constitute a general class of malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates."

In the first step, l-Arg is hydroxylated to N-hydroxyarginine (NOHA). In the second step, NOHA is oxidized to citrulline and NO. Three major isoforms, iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS, have been found in macrophages, endothelial cells, and neuronal tissues, respectively. All three NOS isoforms are dimeric. Each subunit of the dimer contains two domains: a reductase domain that binds FMN, FAD, and NADPH and an oxygenase domain that contains heme and tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B). The electron transfer from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain, which is essential for the enzymatic activity, is regulated by binding of a calcium-calmodulin complex. When the calciumcalmodulin complex is present, electrons flow from NADPH through FMN and FAD in one subunit to the oxygenase domain of the other subunit (7Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D.

The crystal structures of the oxygenase domains from all three isoforms have been determined. They show that the substrate l-Arg binds directly above the heme iron atom, whereas the cofactor H4B binds along the side of the heme.

EPR and optical absorption data show that during the hydroxylation of l-Arg, the disappearance of the oxygenbound heme is kinetically and quantitatively coupled to the formation of NOHA and a H4B radical species (15Wei C.C.

Using rapid freeze-quench EPR and stopped flow optical absorption measurements, it has been demonstrated that in the second step of the catalytic cycle the H4B radical is first formed and then decayed, suggesting that H4B serves as an electron mediator during the reaction (17Wei C.C.

Though recent emphasis has been placed on the catalytic role of H4B, experiments have also given indications that it plays an important structural role. Based on the crystal structures of the oxygenase domain of iNOS (iNOSoxy), Crane et al. (8Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

In addition, biochemical studies of various isoforms of NOS, showed that H4B binding introduces significant changes in protein stability, monomer/dimer equilibrium, proteolytic susceptibility, heme-ligand binding, and substrate binding properties (21Abu-Soud H.M.

In contrast, based on the crystal structure of the oxygenase domain of eNOS (eNOSoxy), Raman et al. (11Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) reported that H4B binding does not produce any conformational changes in the protein, and more importantly the dimeric assembly is retained in the absence of H4B. The heme iron is coordinated by four pyrrole nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin ring and a proximal thiolate ligand from a cysteine residue. The Fe–S stretching mode of the proximal bond was identified at 338 cm-1 by Schelvis et al. (27Schelvis J.P. Berka V. Babcock G.T. Tsai A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5695-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the resonance Raman spectrum with near-UV excitation. The Fe–S stretching frequency is lower than that in cytochrome P-450s, indicating a weaker Fe–S bond that may be important for the catalytic function of NOS. Based on resonance Raman and optical absorption spectra of NOS, in the absence of l-Arg and H4B the ferric heme iron is in a six-coordinated low spin electronic configuration with a water or a dithiothreitol (DTT) molecule coordinated to the distal side of the heme. A six-coordinate low spin to a five-coordinate high spin heme transition was observed upon H4B or l-Arg binding, reflecting the exclusion of the sixth ligand, either water or DTT, from the heme iron (28Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22255-22258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wu C. Zhang J. Abu-Soud H. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This is similar to the low spin to high spin transition observed in the cytochrome P-450 class of proteins, in which a water molecule bound to the heme iron is displaced upon substrate binding (32McMillan K. Masters B.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is believed that substrate binding to P450 interferes with ligand binding to the heme iron because of a steric constraint that is imposed by the substrate located directly over the heme iron (33Poulos T.L. Raag R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 2843-2850Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The analogous displacement of water or DTT in NOS induced by l-Arg binding has been attributed to the same origin (35Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12446-12451Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, such a steric interaction cannot account for the H4B binding-induced spin transition, considering the fact that the H4B binding site is on the peripheral side of the heme. The origin for the exclusion of the distal ligand upon H4B binding thus has been an open question. It has been shown that the NO produced at the end of the catalytic reaction remains in the distal pocket and rebinds to the heme iron, thereby inhibiting the enzyme. Although the crystal structures of the oxygenase domains of the three isoforms of NOS are almost identical, the degree of the autoinhibition by NO follows the order nNOS > iNOS > eNOS (36Abu-Soud H.M.

Resonance Raman studies of the three NOS isoforms showed that the frequencies of the νFe–CO and νC–O modes of CO-bound nNOS were shifted with respect to those of eNOS and iNOS in the presence of l-Arg, plausibly because of a unique binding geometry of l-Arg in nNOS with respect to those in eNOS and iNOS (38Fan B. Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12660-12665Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, ENDOR data of the high spin ferric ligand-free enzyme showed that the binding geometries of l-Arg or NOHA with respect to the heme iron are essentially the same for eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS (39Tierney D.L.

Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the catalytic mechanism for the conversion from l-Arg to NOHA is fundamentally different than that from NOHA to citrulline (1Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

This is supported by the ENDOR data, showing that the hydroxylated nitrogen of NOHA is held 3.8 Å from the Fe, closer than the corresponding guanidino nitrogen of l-Arg (4.05 A) in each of the three isoforms (39Tierney D.L.

However, Raman data showed that the Fe–C–O-related vibrational modes of the ferrous CO-bound nNOS in the presence of l-Arg are essentially identical to those in the presence of l-NOHA. Furthermore, the O–O stretching frequency of the oxyderivative of nNOSoxy in the presence l-Arg is the same as that in the presence of NOHA (42Couture M. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3201-3205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a first step to reconcile these disparate results, we have examined the influence of l-Arg and/or H4B binding on the ligand-protein interactions in iNOSoxy, by using CO, NO, and CN- as structural probes for the ferric and ferrous derivatives of iNOSoxy. We found that heme distortion introduced by l-Arg and/or H4B binding plays an important role in modulating the ligand-protein interactions in iNOSoxy. The possible role of this distortion is discussed in the context of the catalytic function of the enzyme. l-Arginine, DTT, sodium cyanide, and sodium dithionite were purchased from Sigma. (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The natural abundant gases, N2, CO, and NO were obtained from Tech Air (White Plains, NY). The isotopically labeled compounds, 12C18O, K13C14N, K12C15N, K13C15N, and 15N16O, were supplied by Icon (Mount Marion, NY). The oxygenase domain of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOSoxy) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in the absence of both l-Arg and H4B as described previously (42Couture M. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3201-3205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The enzyme was kept in EPPS buffer at pH 7.6 in the presence of 1 mm DTT. Preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen in buffer containing 10% glycerol. Prior to use, the protein was washed three times with EPPS buffer using a centrifugal filtration unit (Ultrafree-15, Biomax-10K NMWL membrane from Millipore). To generate the l-Arg- and/or H4B-bound derivatives, l-Arg and H4B were added to the filtered enzyme in 100 and 3–5 × excess with regard to the heme, respectively. The enzyme was then incubated for ∼18 h at 4 °C. The binding of l-Arg and H4B was confirmed by monitoring changes in the spin and coordination state of the ferric heme with optical absorption spectroscopy. The protein concentration for each sample was ∼50 μm. The samples used for optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopic measurements on the NO, CO, and CN- derivatives were first purged with N2 gas in an anaerobic cell. To form the ferric-NO complexes, 400 μl of 1 atm of NO was injected into the cell using a Hamilton (Reno, NV) gas-tight syringe. Immediately prior to injection, NO gas was scrubbed by passage through a solution of 10 m NaOH. H4B titrations were performed by injecting different volumes of a N2-purged 1 mm H4B stock solution into the anaerobic sample prior to NO injection. To form the ferrous-CO complexes, the purged samples were reduced with sodium dithionite and 400 μl of 1 atm of CO was injected into the cell. To form the ferric-CN- adducts, sodium cyanide solutions were added to the enzyme to a final concentration of 20 mm under anaerobic conditions. Cyanide adducts were kept in anaerobic conditions to minimize the oxidation of H4B, which increased the fluorescence from the samples. Both H4B and cyanide solutions were purged with N2 gas prior to injection into an anaerobic cell-containing sample. Optical absorption spectra were taken on a Shimadzu UV2100U spectrophotometer. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained by using 406.7 or 413.1 nm excitation from a Kr ion laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) or 441.6 nm excitation from a He-Cd laser (Liconix, Santa Clara, CA). The incident power on the sample was kept under 3 milliwatts, and the sample cell was rotated at ∼6000 rpm during the spectral acquisition to avoid photodamage. The scattered laser light was collected and focused onto an entrance slit (100 μm) of a 1.25-m SPEX spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) and was then detected using a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Princeton, NJ). All of the resonance Raman spectra were frequency calibrated by using spectral lines from indene (Sigma), except that for those in the 1800–2000 cm-1 spectral region, an acetone/ferricyanide combination was used instead. Cosmic rays artifacts were removed from the spectra by using a routine in the Winspec spectral acquisition software (Roper Scientific). Intensity references were not added to the samples, so the changes that are detected are all relative to the other modes in the spectra. All measurements were made at room temperature. Data were averaged and accumulated for a total integration time of 30 min/spectra for most cases. A longer integration time of 60 min was used to improve the signal to noise ratio for the CN- adducts and the νC-O spectral region of the CO adduct. The non-planarity of the hemes was analyzed by the normal-coordinate structural decomposition (NSD) program written by J. A. Shelnutt. 2Available at jasheln.unm.edu. This program analyzes the heme or porphyrin structure, such as those from the protein data bank, and decomposes any distortions into different symmetry types that may be related directly to vibrational modes. It also gives a mean atomic displacement from the ideal square planar geometry of the porphyrin for the total distortion and for each symmetry type (43Shelnutt J.A. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. 7. Academic Press, New York2000: 168-223Google Scholar). The optical absorption spectra of various oxidation and ligation states of iNOSoxy are shown in Fig. 1. In the absence of l-Arg and H4B, the Soret transition of the ferric protein is located at 420 nm, which is characteristic of a six-coordinate low spin heme (Fig. 1A). Upon the addition of either l-Arg or H4B, the Soret transition shifts to ∼400 nm, because of a partial conversion to a five-coordinated high spin heme. When l-Arg and H4B are both present, the Soret transition further shifts to 395 nm, indicating a full conversion to the five-coordinated high spin heme. Binding NO or CN- to the ferric heme iron causes a red shift of the Soret transition to 439 nm as shown in Fig. 1B, which is typical for a six-coordinated low spin ferric heme with a proximal cysteine axial ligand. On the other hand, the Soret transition of the CO-bound ferrous protein is located at 445 nm. In contrast to the ligand-free enzyme, the Soret transitions of the NO-, CN--, and CO-bound complexes were found to be unaffected by the addition of H4B and/or l-Arg (data not shown). Resonance Raman spectroscopy with Soret excitation has been successfully applied to study structural and functional relationships of heme proteins for several decades. The high frequency region (1000–1700 cm-1) of the spectrum is very sensitive to the oxidation and coordination states of the heme groups. In particular, the ν4 vibrational heme mode in the 1340–1380-cm-1 region is very sensitive to the electron density on the heme macrocycle and hence is a good indicator of the oxidation state of the heme iron. The ν3 vibrational mode in the 1475–1520-cm-1 region is sensitive to both the coordination and spin state of the heme iron, whereas the ν2 vibrational mode in the 1560–1590-cm-1 region is sensitive to the heme spin state. In contrast, in the low frequency region of the spectrum (200–800 cm-1), the specific axial ligands coordinated to the prosthetic heme group can be identified by detecting iron-ligand stretching and/or bending modes. In addition, when the prosthetic heme group is deformed from the planar structure, several heme out-of-plane modes may be strongly enhanced in this region of the spectrum (44Blackwood Jr., M.E. Rush III, T.S. Romesberg F. Schultz P.G. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 45Yeh S.R. Takahashi S. Fan B. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The frequencies and intensities of the Raman lines are further modulated by the protein environment surrounding the heme and, therefore, provide useful structural information for heme proteins. The Ligand-free Ferric Complex—The high frequency resonance Raman spectra of the ferric derivatives of iNOSoxy are presented in Fig. 2. In the absence of l-Arg and H4B (spectrum a), a typical six-coordinate low spin spectrum was obtained with the ν4 and ν3 marker lines present at 1372 and 1500 cm-1. Upon the addition of l-Arg, the ν3 marker line shifts to 1487 cm-1 (Fig. 2, spectrum b), indicating a conversion to a five-coordinate high spin complex. Although the optical absorption spectrum showed only partial conversion from the six-coordinate low spin state to the five-coordinate high spin complex (Fig. 1A), only the high spin component was detected in the resonance Raman spectrum, because the spectral lines from the low spin species were not enhanced with 406.7-nm excitation. The low frequency region of the spectrum was not examined in this study. Nonetheless, in a study of eNOS, changes in certain low frequency modes were identified upon the addition of l-Arg and were interpreted as an indication of a protein structural change (27Schelvis J.P. Berka V. Babcock G.T. Tsai A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5695-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Ferrous CO-bound Complex—The low frequency resonance Raman spectra of the ferrous-CO derivatives of iNOSoxy complexes were obtained in the presence and absence of l-Arg and/or H4B (Fig. 3A). In the absence of l-Arg and H4B, the two lines at 491 and 562 cm-1, as shown in the resonance Raman spectrum a, were assigned to the Fe–CO stretching (νFe–CO) and Fe–C–O bending (δFe–C–O) modes, respectively, based on the isotope difference spectrum shown in Fig. 3B. In the difference spectrum, all the heme modes are cancelled out, and the spectral features remaining in the spectrum are associated only with the vibrational modes involving CO. The split of the 491-cm-1 mode in the difference spectrum is a result of structural inhomogeneity of the Fe–CO moiety as reflected by a broad feature in the original νFe–CO mode. With the same isotope substitution experiment, a C-O stretching mode (νC–O) was assigned at 1946 cm-1 as shown in Fig. 3C. These CO-related vibrational modes are consistent with the data reported previously on the full-length enzyme and on other isoforms (38Fan B. Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12660-12665Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 42Couture M. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3201-3205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). No significant shifts in the frequencies or changes in spectral shapes were detected in the CO-related vibrational modes upon the addition of H4B (Fig. 3, spectra c). In contrast, the addition of l-Arg caused a shift in the frequency of the νFe–CO mode from 491 to 512 cm-1 and the δFe–CO mode from 562 to 569 cm-1(spectra b). In addition, the νCO mode shifted from 1946 to 1907 cm-1. All three of the Fe–C–O-related modes sharpened in the presence of l-Arg, indicating a direct interaction between l-Arg and the heme-bound CO. Similar spectra were observed in the presence of both l-Arg and H4B (spectra d). Table I summarizes the νFe–CO, δFe–CO, and νCO modes of the iNOSoxy complexes examined here and those reported for the other complexes of NOS. The similarity between the oxygenase domain and the full-length enzyme indicates that the reductase domain does not significantly modify the heme environment in the oxygenase domain, and hence, the oxygenase domain serves as a valid model for the native enzyme.Table IListing of the νFe–CO, δFe–CO, and νCO modes of the CO-bound ferrous complexes of iNOSOXY, full-length iNOS (iNOSFL), nNOSoxy, full-length nNOS (nNOSFL), and full-length eNOS (eNOSFL) ND, not determined.Complex (Fe2+-CO)νFe-COδFe-COνCORef.cm-1cm-1cm-1iNOSOXY491 (Broad)5621946This workiNOSOXY + L-Arg5125691907This workiNOSOXY + H4B490 (Broad)5621944This workiNOSOXY + L-Arg + H4B5125691905This workiNOSFL + H4B487 (Broad)560194538Fan B.

https://openalex.org/W1971252789,"The involvement of phospholipase D (PLD) in the regulation of melanogenesis was examined. Treatment of B16 mouse melanoma cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) resulted in the activation of PLD and a decrease in melanin content. 1-Butanol, but not 2-butanol, completely blocked the TPA-induced inhibition of melanogenesis, suggesting the involvement of PLD in this event. Reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analyses revealed the existence of both PLD isozymes, PLD1 and PLD2, in B16 cells. When PLD1 or PLD2 was introduced into those cells by an adenoviral gene-transfer technique, both PLD1 and PLD2 were activated by TPA. When PLD1 and PLD2 were overexpressed, PLD2 potently caused a decrease in melanin content, whereas the effect of PLD1 expression on melanin content was minimal. Over-expression of PLD2 itself did not affect protein kinase C activity, as assessed by the intracellular distribution and levels of expression of each isoform expressed in B16 cells. The effects of TPA on the down-regulation of basal or α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-enhanced melanogenesis were almost completely blocked by expressing a lipase activity-negative mutant, LN-PLD2, but not by LN-PLD1. Further, the PLD2-induced decrease in melanin content was accompanied by a decrease in the amount and activity of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in melanogenesis, whereas the mRNA level of tyrosinase was unchanged by the over-expression of PLD2. Moreover, treatment with proteasome inhibitors completely blocked the PLD2-induced down-regulation of melanogenesis. Taken together, the present results indicate that the TPA-induced down-regulation of melanogenesis is mediated by PLD2 but not by PLD1 through the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation of tyrosinase.

This suggests that PLD2 may play an important role in regulating pigmentation in vivo. Melanin is a mixture of pigmented biopolymers specifically synthesized within pigment cells. It plays a number of important roles, including photoprotection, the determination of phenotypic appearance, and the absorption of toxic drugs and chemicals (1Quevedo Jr., W.C. Fitzpatrick T.B. Szabó G. Jimbow K. Fitzpatrick T.B. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Freedberg I.M. Austen K.F. 3rd Ed. in Biology of Melanocytes: Dermatology in General Medicine.

Melanin is synthesized in specialized organelles, termed melanosomes, which are only observed in pigment cells. In melanosomes, melanogenesis is carried out by means of a specific enzymatic pathway initiated by tyrosinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the initial rate-limiting reaction of this process, the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dopaquinone via the intermediate 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (2Hearing V.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1999; 4: 24-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Melanin is a mixture of heterogeneous biopolymers formed from various intermediate products derived from dopaquinone. Because tyrosinase controls the first and rate-limiting step of melanogenesis, it is considered to be the key enzyme of this cascade and is the target of different effectors that regulate melanin synthesis. Mammalian tyrosinase is a type I membrane glycoprotein, which contains six putative N-glycosylation sites (3Müller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schütz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase is extensively processed by post-translational modifications, and those processes have been well characterized. Tyrosinase is first synthesized as a 55-kDa unglycosylated protein (4Hearing V.J. Jiménez M. Int. J. Biochem. 1987; 19: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 5del Marmol V. Beermann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and, like other membrane glycoproteins, it is processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LN, lipase activity-negative; α-MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; pfu, plaque-forming unit; PKC, protein kinase C; PLD, phospholipase D; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. by resident chaperones and enzymes. The 55-kDa tyrosinase protein is modified in the ER by the co-translational addition of multiple N-linked glycans. Complex sugar modifications in the Golgi apparatus further increase the molecular mass of tyrosinase to 80 kDa, the size of the mature protein (6Halaban R. Pomerantz S.H. Marshall S. Lambert D.T. Lerner A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Halaban R. Pomerantz S.H. Marshall S. Lerner A.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The 80-kDa tyrosinase protein is eventually transferred from the trans-Golgi network to melanosomes, the site of melanin synthesis, by vesicle transport. Melanogenesis is regulated by a variety of environmental and hormonal factors, such as ultraviolet radiation and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), and is aberrantly modulated in many different types of pigment cell disorders, including albinism, vitiligo, and melanoma (1Quevedo Jr., W.C.

The regulatory mechanisms of melanogenesis, however, are not yet fully understood. Phospholipase D (PLD) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to generate an important lipid mediator, phosphatidic acid. Although the precise physiological relevance of PLD remains to be elucidated, receptor-stimulated PLD activity has been implicated in a broad range of physiological responses including secretion, superoxide generation, proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses (9Exton J.H.

In mammals, two PLD isozymes, PLD1 and PLD2, have been identified. These phospholipases share several similar properties. They have about 50% amino acid similarity and show a broad tissue distribution (11Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem.

They utilize phosphatidylcholine as a substrate and require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for their activation (9Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

In contrast, PLD2 exhibits a high basal activity and is less responsive to PLD1-activating factors such as PKCα, ADP-ribosylation factor, and RhoA (9Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Despite the quite distinct regulatory features of these isozymes in vitro, it has been demonstrated that both isozyme activities are under the control of a tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in intact cells (9Exton J.H.

Acta. 2002; 1580: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The isozyme-specific function(s) of PLD as well as the molecular mechanism(s) of their regulation remain to be clarified. It has been reported previously that treatment of B16 mouse melanoma cells with TPA resulted in the strong inhibition of melanogenesis (22Fuller B.B. Niekrasz I. Hoganson G.E. Mol. Cell.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible involvement of PLD in the TPA-induced inhibition of melanogenesis and to determine whether tyrosinase is a downstream target of PLD. We assessed the involvement of PLD isozymes in the TPA-induced regulation of melanogenesis by over-expressing PLD1 or PLD2 using an adenoviral gene-transfer system. We show that PLD2 but not PLD1 is involved in TPA-induced inhibition of melanogenesis. The molecular mechanism of PLD2-mediated inhibition of melanogenesis is assessed herein.

Melanin Determination—The melanin content was determined as described previously (27Oka M. Nagai H. Ando H. Fukunaga M. Matsumura M. Araki K. Ogawa W. Miki T. Sakaue M. Tsukamoto K. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Ichihashi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 699-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, cells from a subconfluent monolayer in a 10-cm culture dish were solubilized in 150 μl of 1 N NaOH, incubated at 80 °C for 2 h, and vortexed to solubilize the melanin. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 400 nm and was compared with a standard curve of known concentrations of synthetic melanin (Sigma). The melanin content is expressed as μg/mg protein. PLD Assay—PLD activity was assayed by monitoring the in vivo transphosphatidylation activity (28Wakelam M.J.O. Hodgkin M. Martin A. Kendall D.A. Hill S.J. Signal Transduction Protocols. Humana Press Inc, Clifton, New Jersey1995: 271-278Google Scholar). Cells in six-well culture plates were infected with various plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell of adenovirus. One day after infection, cells were incubated with 1-[1-14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (0.25 μCi/107 cells) for 16 h at 37 °C and were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated in the presence of 1% ethanol (in a total volume of 1 ml) in serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with 5 nm TPA in the presence of 1% ethanol for 30 min. During the incubation, the reaction proceeded in a linear fashion. After incubation, the medium was removed by aspiration, and ice-cold methanol (400 μl) was added to each well. The cells were scraped into an Eppendorf tube (1.5 ml) and kept on ice; chloroform (400 μl) was then added to each tube. After mixing, 0.1 N HCl/1 mm EGTA (400 μl) was added, and the solution was mixed vigorously. The tube was centrifuged, and the organic phase was separated. The lipids extracted were analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described previously (29Nakamura S. Shimooku K. Akisue T. Jinnai H. Hitomi T. Kiyohara Y. Ogino C. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Proc.

Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA (5 μg) was subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following primers were used for mouse PLD1 (30Colley W.C. Altshuller Y.M. Sue-Ling C.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Branch K.D. Tsirka S.E. Bollag R.J. Bollag W.B.

The PCR was carried out in a PCR Thermal Cycler MP (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) in a 50-μl reaction volume using Hot Star Taq (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for 35 cycles. An aliquot (10 μl) of each reaction sample was analyzed in a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide fluorescence staining. Molecular weight markers (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were used to estimate the size of the amplified fragments. Adenovirus Vectors—The adenovirus vectors for rat FLAG-epitope-tagged PLD1 (32Oka M. Hitomi T. Okada T. Nakamura S. Nagai H. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Kikkawa U. Ichihashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and rat FLAG-epitope-tagged PLD2 (20Sarkar S. Miwa N. Kominami H. Igarashi N. Hayashi S. Okada T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 599-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generated as described previously and were designated AxPLD1 and Ax-PLD2, respectively. To generate lipase activity-negative PLD1 (LNPLD1) and PLD2 (LN-PLD2), site-directed mutagenesis (to create K860R and K758R, respectively) was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-G CTC ATC TAT GTC CAC AGC AGG TTG TTA ATT GCT GAT-3′, 5′-C ATC TAT ATC CAC AGC AGG TTG CTC ATT GCA GAT GAC-3′ and their reverse complements were used, respectively. The adenovirus vectors for rat FLAG-epitope-tagged LN-PLD1 and LN-PLD2 were generated as described previously (20Sarkar S. Miwa N. Kominami H. Igarashi N. Hayashi S. Okada T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 599-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were designated AxLN-PLD1 and AxLN-PLD2, respectively. The adenovirus carrying the β-galactosidase gene (LacZ) from Escherichia coli (33Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugamo S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. I. Saito (Tokyo University, Japan), was designated as AxLacZ and was used as a control virus. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-PLD1 and FLAG-PLD2—Cells plated into 10-cm tissue culture dishes were infected with various doses of adenovirus. One day after infection, cells were washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (30 μl) (Sigma) for 3 h with constant mixing. The immunoprecipitates were used for immunoblot analysis. Preparation of Cytosol and Particulate Fractions—Cells plated into 10-cm tissue culture dishes were infected with either AxLacZ or Ax-PLD2. At the indicated time points after infection, cells were washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline and were disrupted by sonication in buffer A without Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were used as cytosolic fractions. The pellets were solubilized in buffer A and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used as particulate fractions. Immunoblot Analysis—For the detection of PLD2 and tyrosinase, the cells were lysed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 μm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Each cell lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots from the cytosolic and particulate fractions or immunoprecipitates of FLAG-PLD1 and FLAG-PLD2 were separated by SDS-7.5% PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated with antibodies against PLD2, tyrosinase (αPEP-7), FLAG, PKCα, PKCδ, PKCϵ, or PKCζ, and were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat (for PLD2), anti-rabbit (for tyrosinase and PKCζ), or anti-mouse (for FLAG-PLD1, FLAG-PLD2, PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ) secondary antibodies. The color reaction was carried out using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-phosphate and nitro-blue tetrazolium as substrates, as described previously (34Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase Assay—Tyrosinase activity was measured using a modification of the method of Pomerantz (35Pomerantz S.H. Science. 1969; 164: 838-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells from a subconfluent monolayer in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were solubilized in 250 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 μm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After sonication for 20 s on ice, the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 90 μl of each clarified cell extract was incubated with 10 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 μCi of l-[ring-3,5-3H]tyrosine, 5 μg l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 60 min at 37 °C. 1 ml of activated charcoal (10% w/v) in 0.1 m citric acid was then added to stop the reaction, and the aliquots were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were applied to Dowex-50 columns (0.6 × 4 cm) equilibrated in 0.1 m citric acid, washed with 0.5 ml of 0.1 m citric acid, and the effluents were counted by scintillation spectrometry to determine the extent of formation of 3H2O. Northern Blot Analysis of Tyrosinase—Total RNA (25 μg) was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (36Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar), electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). After baking for 2 h at 80 °C, the membrane was prehybridized for 1 h at 42 °C in 40% (v/v) formamide, 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% each of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, bovine serum albumin, and Ficoll 400), 4× sodium citrate/chloride (SSC) buffer (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 20 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. The blot was then hybridized overnight at 42 °C with randomly primed 32P-labeled mouse tyrosinase cDNA clone Tyrs-J (37Yamamoto H. Takeuchi S. Kudo T. Sato C. Takeuchi T. Jpn. J. Genet. 1989; 64: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in a solution containing 4× SSC, 40% (v/v) formamide, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1× Denhardt's solution, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was washed at 65 °Cin0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS, dried, and autoradiographed. After boiling for 5 min in 0.1% SDS, the membrane was rehybridized with 32P-labeled mouse β-actin cDNA (Clontech Laboratories) under the conditions described above as an internal loading control. TPA Causes Activation of PLD and Suppresses Melanogenesis—To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the TPA-induced inhibition of melanogenesis, the effects of TPA on PLD activity, a well known downstream target of TPA, as well as the effects upon melanin content were examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of the cells with 5 nm TPA for 72 h markedly decreased the melanin content. TPA at this concentration caused a marked stimulation of PLD activity (Fig. 1B). These results suggest a potential involvement of PLD in the TPA-induced inhibition of melanogenesis. Reversal of TPA-induced Suppression of Melanogenesis by 1-Butanol—To confirm that PLD activation is a necessary downstream event in TPA-induced suppression of melanogenesis, the effects of 1-butanol upon the TPA-induced inhibition of melanogenesis were investigated (Fig. 2). 1-Butanol is a primary alcohol frequently used as a substrate for the PLD transphosphatidylation reaction at the expense of phosphatidic acid production, which inhibits PLD-induced phosphatidic acid-mediated biological responses (38Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The TPA-induced suppression of melanogenesis was completely reversed by 1-butanol, whereas it was unaffected by 2-butanol, indicating that PLD activation is necessary for the TPA-induced suppression of melanogenesis. Expression of Both PLD Isozymes in B16 Cells—The expression of PLD isoforms in B16 cells was estimated by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 3A). As it has been previously reported that PLD1 and PLD2 are abundantly expressed in kidney and lung tissues, respectively (30Colley W.C. Altshuller Y.M. Sue-Ling C.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Branch K.D. Tsirka S.E. Bollag R.J. Bollag W.B. Frohman M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), these tissues were used as positive controls for each PLD isozyme. The specific primers to mouse PLD1 and PLD2 amplified signals of 863 and 332 bp, respectively, in B16 cells, and these bands exactly matched the estimated sizes and signals from the positive controls. The control experiments in the absence of template DNA are not shown, but no PCR products were detectable. As it has been reported previously that the expression of PLD2 is very low in B16 cells (39Ohguchi K. Bannno Y. Akao Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3408-3412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), its expression was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, PLD2 was clearly detected by an anti-PLD2 antibody at the same molecular position as the positive control. These results indicate that B16 cells express both PLD1 and PLD2. Activation of Both PLD1 and PLD2 by TPA—To examine whether both PLD1 and PLD2 are under the control of TPA in B16 cells, the effects of TPA on PLD activation in the cells over-expressing either PLD1 or PLD2 were examined (Fig. 4). Both basal and TPA-stimulated PLD activities were enhanced in PLD1- or PLD2-over-expressing cells. Upon stimulation by TPA, PLD1 and PLD2 activity increased ∼3-fold and 2-fold over basal activity, respectively. Neither basal nor TPA-stimulated PLD activity was affected by the control viral infection. These results indicate that both PLD1 and PLD2 activities are under the control of TPA in B16 cells. Effects of Over-expression of PLD1 and PLD2 on PLD Activity and Melanin Content—Because both PLD1 and PLD2 are expressed in B16 cells, it is necessary to assess whether either or both PLD isozymes are involved in the regulation of melanogenesis. To get the isozyme-specific effects of PLD, we established a high basal PLD activity, which is comparable with TPA-stimulated PLD activity, by infecting B16 cells with high doses of AxPLD1 or AxPLD2. Infection of cells with either AxPLD1 or AxPLD2 enhanced basal PLD activity in a viral dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The basal PLD activity at each pfu of AxPLD2 was ∼2-fold higher than that of AxPLD1 at the corresponding pfu, presumably because PLD2 has a high basal activity in cells (11Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 21Xie Z. Ho W.-T. Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Importantly, there was a marked decrease in melanin content in the cells over-expressing PLD2. In cells over-expressing PLD1, there was a small decrease in melanin content, which is consistent with a recent report that PLD1 stably expressed in B16 cells caused a decrease in melanin content (39Ohguchi K. Bannno Y. Akao Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3408-3412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Infec"
https://openalex.org/W2113626439,"Protein engineers have widely adopted directed evolution as a design algorithm, but practitioners have not come to a consensus about the best method to evolve protein molecular recognition. We previously used DNA shuffling to direct the evolution of Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase (GUS) variants with increased β-galactosidase activity. Epistatic (synergistic) mutations in amino acids 557, 566, and 568, which are part of an active site loop, were identified in that experiment (Matsumura, I., and Ellington, A. D. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 305, 331–339). Here we show that site saturation mutagenesis of these residues, overexpression of the resulting library in E. coli, and high throughput screening led to the rapid evolution of clones exhibiting increased activity in reactions with p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (pNP-xyl). The xylosidase activities of the 14 fittest clones were 30-fold higher on average than that of the wild-type GUS. The 14 corresponding plasmids were pooled, amplified by long PCR, self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and transformed into E. coli. Thirteen clones exhibiting an average of 80-fold improvement in xylosidase activity were isolated in a second round of screening. One of the evolved proteins exhibited a ∼200-fold improvement over the wild type in reactivity (kcat/Km) with pNP-xyl, with a 290,000-fold inversion of specificity. Sequence analysis of the 13 round 2 isolates suggested that all were products of intermolecular recombination events that occurred during whole plasmid PCR. Further rounds of evolution using DNA shuffling and staggered extension process (StEP) resulted in modest improvement. These results underscore the importance of epistatic interactions and demonstrate that they can be optimized through variations of the facile whole plasmid PCR technique.

Adaptive evolution is arguably the most fundamental biological process, although it remains poorly understood. A better understanding of molecular adaptation would facilitate the engineering of enzymes with novel specificities. Theoreticians have proposed that a relatively small number of catalytically inefficient, broad specificity proto-enzymes diversified through gene duplication and adaptive evolution into the multitude of efficient and specialized catalysts present in the contemporary biosphere (2Kacser H. Beeby R. J Mol. Evol. 1984; 20: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Lazcano A. Diaz-Villagomez E. Mills T. Oro J. Adv.

This supposition cannot be proven nor refuted through experimentation, but recapitulation of the diversification process in the laboratory would support its feasibility and reveal possible underlying structural mechanisms. The glycoside hydrolases exemplify enzyme diversification. Natural selection has matched the great structural diversity of carbohydrates with a multitude of enzymes that selectively catalyze their cleavage. These enzymes have been classified into 91 families based on amino acid sequence similarity (7Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The GH-A clan (sometimes called the 4/7 superfamily) comprises >3000 GenBank™ sequences from Families 1, 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, 35, 39, 42, 53, 59, 72, 79, and 86 (8Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). All GH-A enzymes retain the same (β/α)8-barrel fold and catalytic mechanism (9Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor (10Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5674PubMed Google Scholar). Consider the specific example of two well characterized glycoside hydrolases: human β-glucuronidase (GUS, 1The abbreviations used are: GUS, β-glucuronidase; XYL, β-xylosidase; PSQ, β-glucuronidase mutants containing Pro557/Ser566/Gln568; PAF, β-glucuronidase mutants containing Pro557/Ala566/Phe568; pNP-gluc, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronide; pNP-xyl, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside; StEP, staggered extension process; LB, Luria broth.1The abbreviations used are: GUS, β-glucuronidase; XYL, β-xylosidase; PSQ, β-glucuronidase mutants containing Pro557/Ser566/Gln568; PAF, β-glucuronidase mutants containing Pro557/Ala566/Phe568; pNP-gluc, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronide; pNP-xyl, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside; StEP, staggered extension process; LB, Luria broth. Family 2) and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum β-xylosidase (XYL, Family 39). These distant homologs catalyze the hydrolysis of similar substrates that differ only in their C5 substituents (carboxylate for β-glucuronides, hydrogen for β-xylosides), but overlap very little in specificity. Their amino acid sequences are too divergent to align, but six conserved active site residues are superimposable (Fig. 1) (11Yang J.K. Yoon H.J. Ahn H.J. Il Lee B. Pedelacq J.D. Liong E.C. Berendzen J. Laivenieks M. Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Vocadlo D.J. Withers S.G. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.W.

X-ray crystallography is essential to understanding the structural basis of enzyme specificity, but the complexity of protein structures necessitates the development of complementary functional approaches. We randomly mutate genes or parts of genes, and express the resulting libraries in populations of microorganisms. High throughput screening enables the functional evaluation of thousands of sequence variants in parallel. Iterative cycles of mutagenesis, point mutant recombination, and high throughput screening lead to the accumulation of beneficial mutations in selected clones (13Rowe L.A. Geddie M.L. Alexander O.B. Matsumura I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Directed evolution has been used to alter properties of enzymes including substrate specificity (reviewed in Refs. 14Farinas E.T. Bulter T. Arnold F.H. Curr. Opin.

Engl. 2001; 40: 3948-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli GUS is a good model system for the study of adaptive evolution. As noted above, the human GUS protein has been crystallized; the amino acid sequences of the E. coli and human GUS homologs are 50% identical, with highly conserved active sites (12Jain S. Drendel W.B. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Sly W.S. Grubb J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The E. coli β-glucuronidase gene (gusA, formerly uidA) is more amenable to directed evolution, because it can be overexpressed at high levels in E. coli, enabling the detection of weak catalytic activities in reactions with β-xylosides and other non-native substrates. We have previously directed the evolution of GUS variants with increased β-galactosidase activity. We expressed a library of randomly mutated gusA alleles in a lacZ-E. coli strain. Clones exhibiting increased β-galactosidase activity on LB agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) were isolated. After two additional rounds of DNA shuffling (point mutation recombination, Ref. 19Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) and screening, clones exhibiting 500-fold increases in β-galactosidase activity were isolated. All clones were sequenced, and the fittest allele contained 13 mutations. We dissected the effects of these mutations through site-directed mutagenesis and found that four amino acids changes in an active site loop (T509A, S557P, N566S, K568Q) accounted for the changes in substrate specificity (1Matsumura I. Ellington A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here we extend a recently developed mutagenesis strategy (20Sio C.F. Riemens A.M. van der Laan J.M.

We randomized specificity-determining residues that were identified in our previous study (Ser557, Asn566, Lys568) by saturation mutagenesis (also called combinatorial cassette mutagenesis, Refs. 22Miyazaki K.

The selected clones were further evolved through random mutagenesis and point mutation recombination and high throughput screening (Table I).Table ISummary of evolution experiments The library was constructed in a different way for each round of evolution. The average selection coefficient (improvement in fitness over the ancestor) for each population was determined in quantitative whole cell xylosidase assays.

Geddie M.L. Alexander O.B. Matsumura I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides (Fig. 2) were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA); the pNP-β-d-xylopyranoside (pNP-xyl) was from Sigma-Aldrich. The GeneAmp XL polymerase kit, including the rTth and Vent polymerases, was from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Saturation Mutagenesis—The codons encoding gusA amino acids 557, 566, and 568 were randomized by whole plasmid PCR (28Eisinger D.P. Trumpower B.L. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 250-252, 254Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) using a mixture of Tth and Vent polymerase (29Cheng S. Fockler C. Barnes W.M. Higuchi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and back-to-back 5′-phosphorylated degenerate primers: 5′-GCGCAATATGCCTTGKNNGGTCGAAAATCGG-3′ (gusA S557X) and 5′-GTTGGCGGTNNKAAGNNKGGGATCTTCACTCGC-3′ (gusA N566X,K568X), where K is T or G. The long PCR reactions contained 50 ng of the ancestral gusA expression vector, 500 nm primers, 200 nm of each dNTP, 1× ABI XL buffer II, and 1.5 mm magnesium acetate. The reactions were overlaid with light mineral oil and heated to 80 °C in a thermal cycler for a hot start. 0.5 μl of the Tth/Vent mixture was added, and the temperatures were immediately raised to 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C × 15 s, 68 °C × 5 min (1 min per kb). The reaction was further incubated at 72 °C for 10 min and stored at 4 °C. The mineral oil was removed, and the PCR reaction was incubated with 0.5% SDS and 50 μg/ml proteinase K at 65 °C for 15 min to eliminate the thermostable polymerases. The PCR product was purified using the Promega Wizard PCR prep kit (Madison, WI) as directed by the manufacturer, with the final elution in 50 μl of water. The DNA was digested with restriction enzyme DpnI (to eliminate methylated ancestral template), and the desired PCR product was gel-purified using a QiaQuick spin column as directed by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The concentration of eluted DNA was estimated via agarose gel electrophoresis. For intramolecular self-ligation of blunt-ended DNA, we recommend low concentrations of DNA and high concentrations of T4 DNA ligase. 4 fmol of purified PCR product were reacted with 2.5 units of T4 DNA polymerase and 5 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase in 20-μl reactions containing 200 nm each dNTP, 100 μm ATP, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μm bovine serum albumin, for 1 h at 23 °C. The T4 DNA ligase was heat-killed at 65 °C for 10 min, and DNA was purified by butyl alcohol precipitation (30Thomas M.R. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 988-990PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly prepared E. coli InvαF′ cells were transformed by electroporation as described by Dower et al. (31Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). The transformed bacteria were titered, distributed into 384-well plates, and evaluated in our high throughput microplate assay (32Geddie M.L. Rowe L.A. Alexander O.B. I. M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 388: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using pNP-xyl as the substrate. Clones associated with the highest absorbance at 405 nm after 16 h at 37 °C were streaked onto LB-ampicillin agar plates and characterized in a whole cell activity assay. Whole Cell Activity Assays (Secondary Screens)—Microcultures associated with high xylosidase activity in primary screens were streaked onto LB-ampicillin plates. Individual colonies were picked and grown to saturation in a 96-well microplate. 20 μl of the saturated culture was placed in 200 μl of 0.4 mm pNP-β-d-xylopyranoside in a 96-well plate, and the absorbance at 405 nm was monitored for 5 h. Each clone was evaluated in three independent trials, and the average values (and associated S.E.) were calculated. The activity of each clone was normalized to that of the ancestral strain. Whole Plasmid PCR—The 14 plasmids selected in the first round of evolution were purified, pooled, and PCR-amplified as described above using 5′-GGGAAGCTTCTCATTGTTTGCCTCCCTGCTGCG-3′ (3′-gusA3) and 5′-GGGAAGCTTGCGGCCGCACTCGAGCAC-3′ (3′-pE-Tout3). The amplification product was purified, digested with restriction enzymes DpnI and Hind III (to digest the sites underlined in the primer sequence), gel-purified, and self-ligated. The ligation reaction was similar to that described above, except that we used a lower concentration of T4 DNA ligase (1 unit instead of 5), no T4 DNA polymerase (nor dNTPs and bovine serum albumin), and a 16 °C incubation (instead of 23 °C). E. coli strain InvαF′ was transformed with the plasmid library, and the transformants were screened as described above. DNA Shuffling—The gusA alleles isolated in the second round of evolution were pooled and amplified in a standard PCR using 500 nm primers 5′-GGACTTTGCAAGTGGTGAATCCGCAC-3′ (gusA 720) and 3′-gusA3, 50 ng of template DNA, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 15 mm (NH4)SO4, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 5 units of Taq polymerase. The mixture was overlaid with mineral oil and cycled 25 times between 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 2 min. The resulting PCR product was purified according to the Wizard PCR procedure and randomly recombined by DNA shuffling (19Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). We reacted the PCR product with 0.1 units of DNase I in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, for 2 min at 23 °C. The DNA was immediately extracted in phenol/chloroform (50:50) and ethanol precipitated. The fragments were reassembled in a 45 cycle PCR-like reaction with no additional primers. The full-length recombinant products were amplified in the standard PCR reaction as described above and subcloned using overlap PCR as follows (33Temesgen B. Eschrich K. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 828-830, 832Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The ancestral expression vector and part of the gusA gene were amplified in a long PCR (29Cheng S. Fockler C. Barnes W.M. Higuchi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) with 5′-CGGTTTGTGGTTAATCAGGAACTGTTCG-3′ (gusA 900out) and 3′-pETout3. Finally, the shuffled gusA mutants and the vector were combined in a long overlap PCR using primers 3′-gusA3 and 3′-pETout3. The resulting full-length PCR product was purified, restriction-digested, and self-ligated. E. coli strain InvαF′ was transformed with the plasmid library, and the transformants were screened for clones exhibiting increased XYL activity. Staggered Extension Process (StEP)—Plasmids derived from clones isolated in the third round of evolution were purified and pooled. Three overlapping regions of the pooled gusA alleles were amplified separately in standard PCR reactions, except that 100 cycles with short (15 s) extension times were executed. This produces incomplete fragments that can recombine by switching templates (34Zhao H. Giver L. Shao Z. Affholter J.A. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of the gusA gene pool was amplified with 5′-TAATCACCATTCCCGGCGGGATAGTC-3′ (gusA 500out) and 5′-TCTAGATCTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCCGACTG-3′ (rev137), the central region was amplified with 5′-GCCATTTGAAGCCGATGTCACGCCG-3′ (gusA 360) and 5′-CCTGTAAGTGCGCTTGCTGAGTTTCC-3′ (gusA 1150out), and the 3′-end was amplified with 5′-GGGAAGCTTATGTTTGCCTCCCTGCTGCGGTTTTTCA-3′ (3′-gusA2) and 5′-CTGCTGCTGTCGGCTTTAACCTCTCT-3′ (gusA 1080). The three amplification products combined and amplified in an overlap PCR using primers rev137 and 3′-gusA2. The vector was amplified with 5′-AGCTGTTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTATCC-3′ (rev0out) and 3′-pETout3. The vector and insert were then assembled in a long overlap PCR using primers 3′-pETout3 and 3′-gusA2. The resulting library was purified, restriction-digested, and self-ligated. E. coli strain InvαF′ were transformed with the resulting library, and the transformants were screened for clones with improved XYL activity. DNA Sequencing—The evolved gusA alleles were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems Big Dye protocol at the Center for Fundamental and Applied Evolution (Emory University). The 3′-end of every evolved gusA allele was sequenced using the primer 5′-GCTCAGCGGTGGCAGCAGCCAACTC-3′ (GC 3′pET). Particularly interesting alleles (namely 1.15, 2.10, 4.7, and 4.8) were sequenced in their entirety, using the following additional primers: 5′-ATGCTTCCGGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGG-3′ (rev 80), gusA 360, 5′-GGACTTTGCAAGTGGTGAATCCGCAC-3′ (gusA 720), and gusA 1080. Protein Purification and Characterization—Each GUS protein was fused to an N-terminal His6 tag, and the enzymes 1.15, 2.10, 4.7, and 4.8 were purified to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis) using nickel chelate affinity chromatography. The total protein concentration was quantified using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). 5 nm to 1 μm of each purified protein were separately reacted with 1 ml of pNP-β-d-xylopyranoside (concentrations ranging from 10 μm to 1 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), and the formation of the pNP product was followed in a spectrophotometer. The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the initial velocity values to the Michaelis-Menten equation (35Matsumura I. Wallingford J.B. Surana N.K. Vize P.D. Ellington A.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Each of the values (kcat,Km, kcat/Km) reported in Table III (and the associated S.E.) is an average of three independent trials.Table IIIKinetic parameters of the evolved enzymesSubstrate enzymepNP-β-d-xylopyranosidepNP-β-d-glucuronidekcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kms-1μ ms-1m-1s-1μ ms-1m-1WTaWT, wild type GUS0.0010 ± 0.0001360 ± 602.9 ± 0.368 ± 6200 ± 10340,000 ± 20,0001.150.054 ± 0.003660 ± 5081 ± 30.039 ± 0.001210 ± 10190 ± 102.100.063 ± 0.005110 ± 10590 ± 300.042 ± 0.002180 ± 20240 ± 204.7NDbNot determinedND240 ± 100.012 ± 0.001220 ± 1054 ± 24.8NDND190 ± 100.021 ± 0.004280 ± 9080 ± 10a WT, wild typeb Not determined Open table in a new tab Molecular Modeling—We visualized crystal structures, made sitedirected mutants in silico and performed energy minimization calculations using SYBYL (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) at the Biomolecular Computing Resource (BimCore) at Emory University. Saturation Mutagenesis—Our objective was to direct the evolution of GUS variants with XYL activity. The ancestral plasmid for these experiments was a constitutive gusA expression vector constructed for a previous study (13Rowe L.A. Geddie M.L. Alexander O.B. Matsumura I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We first employed gene site saturation mutagenesis to randomize the sequences of three residues: 557, 566, and 568, which were identified in a different directed evolution experiment (1Matsumura I. Ellington A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We encoded all twenty amino acids in a library containing 323 (or 32,768) different clones, which is about three times the throughput of our screen. The library was generated by whole plasmid PCR (28Eisinger D.P. Trumpower B.L. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 250-252, 254Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 37Stemmer W.P. Morris S.K. Kautzer C.R.

Rowe and I. Matsumura, submitted manuscript. using primers containing the degenerate NNK (where K is T or G) sequence. The PCR product was purified, self-ligated, and transformed into E. coli strain InvαF′. E. coli K-12 and its derivatives, including InvαF′, do not contain endogenous XYL activity (39Whitehead T.R. Curr. Microbiol. 1997; 35: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We evaluated ∼10,000 GUS mutants in a semi-automated, high throughput microplate screen (32Geddie M.L. Rowe L.A. Alexander O.B. I. M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 388: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We used a microplate dispensor to distribute transformed cells into 77 × 384 well microtiter plates such that each of the 29,568 wells received an average of one cell in 5 μl of LB-ampicillin medium. As a control, 3 × 384 microcultures were seeded with cells transformed with the ancestral gusA expression vector. The 80 microplates were manually sealed with autoclaved silicone seals and inverted end-over-end in an environmental rotator for 16 h at 37 °C. The microcultures grew to saturation under these conditions, and the GUS proteins were constitutively expressed at high levels. The seals were removed, and 75 μl of 1.0 mm pNP-xyl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, were added to each well. The microplates were incubated at a 45° angle (so that the cells settled into the corner of the wells) at 37 °C for 16 h. The XYL activity associated with each of the 29,568 microcultures was measured in a microplate spectrophotometer. Reconstruction experiments showed that all XYL activity was associated with the cells, rather than the supernatant, suggesting that pNP-xyl was somehow entering the cytoplasm. A Microsoft Excel macro facilitated the identification of the microcultures containing the most XYL activity. The vast majority of the GUS mutants exhibited less XYL activity than the ancestral controls (Fig. 3). We were not surprised because nearly all of the clones were supposed to contain random mutations in three active site residues. The 24 fittest clones were characterized in a more quantitative assay to demonstrate that the increases in xylosidase activity were reproducible (secondary screen). 16 replicates of each clone were propagated in a 384-well plate, in parallel with 48 replicates of the ancestral clone. Each of the cultures was reacted with 1.0 mm pNP-xyl for 16 h at 37 °C. The activity of each clone was calculated by averaging the ΔA405 of 16 replicates. The improvement initially exhibited by 10 of 24 selected clones was not reproducible, perhaps because the corresponding plasmids contained mutations that caused GUS expression to become genetically unstable. These ten clones were discarded. The average XYL activity of the remaining 14 clones was 30-fold higher than that of the ancestor. The best clone evinced 70-fold improvement in fitness (clone 1.11, Table II and Fig. 4). In our previous study, we found that random mutagenesis of the whole gene generated mutants with only 2–4-fold increases in β-galactosidase activity (40Matsumura I. Ellington A.D. Braman J. In Vitro Mutagenesis Protocols. 182. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 259-267Google Scholar). The higher values in the current study support the validity of our saturation mutagenesis strategy.Table IIAnalysis of mutants isolated in first round of evolutionVariant557566568Other mutationsaThe 3′-end of each gusA allele (encoding codons 440-604) isolated in the first round of screening was sequenced.

https://openalex.org/W1986349265,"Scaffold attachment factor-B1 (SAFB1) is a nuclear matrix protein that has been proposed to couple chromatin structure, transcription, and RNA processing. We have previously shown that SAFB1 can repress estrogen receptor (ERalpha)-mediated transactivation. Here we present a structure-function study showing that transactivation is mediated via an intrinsic and transferable C-terminal repression domain (RD). A similar C-terminal RD was found in the family member SAFB2. Removal of the RD from SAFB1 resulted in a dominant-negative SAFB1 protein that increased ligand-dependent and -independent ERalpha activity. SAFB1RD-mediated repression was partly blocked by histone deacetylase inhibitors; however, no histone deacetylase inhibitors were identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the RD as bait. Instead, SAFB1RD was found to interact with TAFII68, a member of the basal transcription machinery. We propose a model in which SAFB1 represses ERalpha activity via indirect association with histone deacetylation and interaction with the basal transcription machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2103540557,"In this study, we have compared the functional consequences of three mutations (R218Q, V260M, and Q266H) in the α1 subunit of the glycine receptor (GlyRA1) causing hyperekplexia, an inherited neurological channelopathy. In HEK-293 cells, the agonist EC50s for glycine-activated Cl- currents were increased from 26 μm in wtGlyRA1, to 5747, 135, and 129 μm in R218Q, V260M, and Q266H GlyRA1 channels, respectively. Cl- currents elicited by β-alanine and taurine, which behave as agonists at wtGlyRA1, were decreased in V260M and Q266H mutant receptors and virtually abolished in GlyRA1 R218Q receptors. Gly-gated Cl- currents were similarly antagonized by low concentrations of strychnine in both wild-type (wt) and R218Q GlyRA1 channels, suggesting that the Arg-218 residue plays a crucial role in GlyRA1 channel gating, with only minor effects on the agonist/antagonist binding site, a hypothesis supported by our molecular model of the GlyRA1 subunit. The R218Q mutation, but not the V260M or the Q266H mutation, caused a marked decrease of receptor subunit expression both in total cell lysates and in isolated plasma membrane proteins. This decreased expression does not seem to explain the reduced agonist sensitivity of GlyRA1 R218Q channels since no difference in the apparent sensitivity to glycine or taurine was observed when wtGlyRA1 receptors were expressed at levels comparable with those of R218Q mutant receptors. In conclusion, multiple mechanisms may explain the dramatic decrease in GlyR function caused by the R218Q mutation, possibly providing the molecular basis for its association with a more severe clinical phenotype. In this study, we have compared the functional consequences of three mutations (R218Q, V260M, and Q266H) in the α1 subunit of the glycine receptor (GlyRA1) causing hyperekplexia, an inherited neurological channelopathy. In HEK-293 cells, the agonist EC50s for glycine-activated Cl- currents were increased from 26 μm in wtGlyRA1, to 5747, 135, and 129 μm in R218Q, V260M, and Q266H GlyRA1 channels, respectively. Cl- currents elicited by β-alanine and taurine, which behave as agonists at wtGlyRA1, were decreased in V260M and Q266H mutant receptors and virtually abolished in GlyRA1 R218Q receptors. Gly-gated Cl- currents were similarly antagonized by low concentrations of strychnine in both wild-type (wt) and R218Q GlyRA1 channels, suggesting that the Arg-218 residue plays a crucial role in GlyRA1 channel gating, with only minor effects on the agonist/antagonist binding site, a hypothesis supported by our molecular model of the GlyRA1 subunit. The R218Q mutation, but not the V260M or the Q266H mutation, caused a marked decrease of receptor subunit expression both in total cell lysates and in isolated plasma membrane proteins. This decreased expression does not seem to explain the reduced agonist sensitivity of GlyRA1 R218Q channels since no difference in the apparent sensitivity to glycine or taurine was observed when wtGlyRA1 receptors were expressed at levels comparable with those of R218Q mutant receptors. In conclusion, multiple mechanisms may explain the dramatic decrease in GlyR function caused by the R218Q mutation, possibly providing the molecular basis for its association with a more severe clinical phenotype. IntroductionFast inhibitory neurotransmission in the adult mammalian central nervous system is primarily mediated by the amino acids γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GlyR, glycine receptor; LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; HE, hyperekplexia; TAU, taurine; β-ALA, β-alanine; STR, strychnine; wt, wild-type. and Gly, which, by activating Cl--selective ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs), hyperpolarize the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron and inhibit firing (1Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are heteropentameric proteins made up of the assembly of two types of homologous subunits: α subunits, which carry the molecular determinants for agonist and antagonist binding, and β subunits, which determine the subsynaptic localization of GlyRs (2Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In humans, only one gene encoding for β subunits has been identified (3Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Prior P. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Taleb O. Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 4: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); this gene is widely expressed in the central nervous system at all developmental stages of vertebrates. On the other hand, four genes encoding distinct α subunits (α1–4) are known, each showing a specific regional distribution and ontogenetic profile (4Laube B. Maksay G. Schemm R. Betz H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In particular, α1 subunits seem to be the predominant isoform expressed postnatally in the spinal cord and brainstem; GlyRs of mature vertebrates are thought to have a 3α12β stoichiometry. The topological organization of the GlyR subunits is believed to be similar to that of other members of the LGIC super-family (5Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1074) Google Scholar), with both the N and the C termini located extracellularly and four transmembrane segments; the second transmembrane segment (M2) determines permeation properties such as anion selectivity and conductance.GlyRs play a central role in the pathophysiology of hyperekplexia (HE), a rare inherited human neurological disease characterized by muscle stiffness, hyperreflexia, and an exaggerated startle response to sensory stimuli (6Zhou L. Chillag K.L. Nigro M.A. Brain Dev. 2002; 24: 669-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The muscle stiffness and hyperreflexia, usually present at birth, decline during the first year of life, although an exaggerated startle response persists during the adult life. The gene associated with hyperekplexia was linked to chromosomal locus 5q33–35 in 1992 (7Ryan S.G. Sherman S.L. Terry J.C. Sparkes R.S. Torres M.C. Mackey R.W. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 31: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); within this region, mutation analysis in HE-affected families proved that the GlyRA1 gene, encoding the α1 subunit of GlyR, was the defective gene in HE (8Shiang R. Ryan S.G. Zhu Y.Z. Hahn A.F. O'Connell P. Wasmuth J.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Several HE-causing mutations are known in the GlyRA1 gene; these include both dominant and recessive inherited mutations, as well as de novo mutations found in sporadic cases. Further support for the hypothesis that abnormal GlyR function causes neurological disturbances derives from the observation that the phenotypes of spasmoid (9Ryan S.G. Buckwalter M.S. Lynch J.W. Handford C.A. Segura L. Shiang R. Wasmuth J.J. Camper S.A. Schofield P. O'Connell P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), spastic (10Kingsmore S.F. Giros B. Suh D. Bieniarz M. Caron M.G. Seldin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and oscillator (11Buckwalter M.S. Cook S.A. Davisson M.T. White W.F. Camper S.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2025-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) mice, all of which carry genetically determined defects in GlyR-encoding genes, bear a striking resemblance to some of the sensorimotor manifestations of human HE.In the present study, we have characterized the functional properties of three GlyRA1 mutations associated with HE. The R218Q mutation, recently described by members of our group (12Miraglia del Giudice E. Coppola G. Bellini G. Ledaal P. Hertz J.M. Pascotto A. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: e71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), affects a residue that is located at the boundary between the extracellular N-terminal domain and M1 and is highly conserved among subunits forming both anion-selective (GlyR and GABAA,CR) and cation-selective (nicotinic α1–7 and α9, β1–4, γ, δ, ϵ; 5HT-3A and 5HT-3B; some purinergic receptors) LGICs (Supplemental Fig. 1). The V260M (13Miraglia del Giudice E. Coppola G. Bellini G. Cirillo G. Scuccimarra G. Pascotto A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 9: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the Q266H (14Milani N. Dalpra L. del Prete A. Zanini R. Larizza L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 420-422PubMed Google Scholar) mutations affect residues located in the M2 domain of GlyRA1 subunits but are not believed to participate in permeation (5Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 15Bera A.K. Chatav M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43002-43010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); they are less well conserved among LGIC subunits. We have used pharmacological, biochemical, and molecular modeling techniques to investigate the molecular basis of these three human “channelopathies” and found evidence that all three residues may cause a variable degree of impairment in GlyR gating, with the most dramatic phenotype associated with the R218Q mutation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis of hGlyRA1 cDNA—Mutations were engineered into the human GlyRA1 cDNA, cloned into the pCIS2 vector, by sequence overlap extension PCR with the Pfu DNA polymerase, as already described (16Castaldo P. Miraglia Del Giudice E. Coppola G. Pascotto A. Annunziato L. Taglialatela M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: RC199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequences were verified using an ABI PRISM 310 sequencing apparatus (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA).Heterologous Expression of GlyRA1 Subunits—Wild-type (wt) and mutant GlyRA1 subunits were transiently expressed via transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells. HEK-293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml), in an humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in 100-mm plastic Petri dishes. For electrophysiological experiments, the cells were seeded on glass coverslips (Carolina Biological Supply Company, Burlington, NC). One day after plating, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of the appropriate cDNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol, together with 2 μg of a plasmid encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clontech) used as a transfection marker. When lower amounts of GlyRA1 cDNA were used for transfection (see Fig. 5), the amount of enhanced green fluorescent protein cDNA was proportionally increased. All of the experiments were performed 1–2 days after transfection.Electrophysiology—Currents were recorded from HEK-293 cells at 20–22 °C using a commercially available amplifier (Axopatch 200A, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was adopted using glass micropipettes of 3–5 megaohms of resistance (17Coppola G. Castaldo P. Miraglia del Giudice E. Bellini G. Galasso F. Soldovieri M.V. Anzalone L. Sferro C. Annunziato L. Pascotto A. Tagliatatela M. Neurology. 2003; 61: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The extracellular and intracellular (pipette) solution contained (in mm): 138 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH; and 140 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.25 mm cAMP, pH 7.3–7.4, with KOH, respectively. The pCLAMP software (v. 6.0.4, Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Statistical differences were evaluated with the Student's t test (p < 0.05). Solution exchanges were achieved by means of a cFlow 8 flow controller attached to a cF-8VS 8-valve switching apparatus and a MPRE8 miniature flow outlet positioned within 200 μm of the cell (Cell Microcontrols, Norfolk, VA).Cell Surface Biotinylation and Western Blotting—Plasma membrane expression of GlyRA1 subunits in HEK-293 cells was investigated by surface biotinylation of membrane proteins in intact cells 2 days after transfection using a cell membrane-impermeable reagent (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol (18Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7991-8000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following biotinylation, the cells were lysed, and biotinylated proteins were isolated by reacting cell lysates with ImmunoPure streptavidin beads (Pierce). GlyR α subunits in streptavidin precipitates and total lysates were revealed in Western blots using an anti-GlyRA monoclonal antibody (mAb4a; Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland; dilution 1:4000); an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences; dilution 1:2000) was used as secondary antibody. Reactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce), using a ChemiDoc station (Bio-Rad). To confirm that intracellular proteins were not labeled by the biotinylation reagent, blots were stripped and reprobed with an anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma; dilution 1:5000).Molecular Modeling—A molecular model of a GlyRA1 subunit was built using a previously described model of the GABAAR α1 subunit as a template (19Bertaccini E. Trudell J.R. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2001; 48: 141-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 21Trudell J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Trudell J.R. Bertaccini E. Br. J. Anaesth. 2002; 89: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We built loops to fill in the gaps between the GlyRA1 sequence and the template sequence and refined the side chains in the model using the auto-rotomer feature in the Biopolymer Module of Insight II (v. 2000.1, Accelrys, San Diego, CA) as described previously (19Bertaccini E. Trudell J.R. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2001; 48: 141-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Trudell J.R. Bertaccini E. Br. J. Anaesth. 2002; 89: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The backbone atoms (C, Cα, N) of each GlyR residue were tethered to the coordinates of corresponding residues in the template with a force constant of 100 kcal/A2, and the structure was optimized with the Discover_3 module of Insight II. Coulombic interactions were calculated with a constant dielectric of one and a cutoff at 9.5 A. The structure was relaxed by performing 5000 2-fs steps of molecular dynamics at 298 K and was then reoptimized with the Discover_3 module to a derivative of 1 kcal/A.RESULTSGlycine Sensitivity of Homomeric GlyRA1s Carrying HE-causing Mutations—The putative topological arrangement of a single GlyR α1 subunit, highlighting the Arg-218, the Val-260, and the Gln-266 residues, is shown in Fig. 1A. To assess the functional consequences of the HE-causing GlyRA1 mutations affecting these residues, we transfected HEK-293 cells with the cDNAs encoding wtGlyRA1 or R218Q, V260M, or Q266H GlyRA1 mutants and recorded Cl- currents carried by the expressed channels upon perfusion with the agonist Gly. In wtGlyRA1-expressing cells, perfusion with concentrations of Gly above 3 μm (0.01–30 mm) activated robust inward Cl- currents when the cell was held at -60 mV (Fig. 1B); the reversal potential of these currents approximated the Cl- equilibrium potential (data not shown), confirming anionic selectivity. The peak amplitude of these Gly-gated Cl- currents increased with Gly concentration up to 300 μm; larger Gly concentrations (3–30 mm) failed to increase Clcurrent peak size, although they accelerated the time course of Gly-gated current desensitization. Peak amplitudes of Gly-gated currents were normalized to the maximum, expressed as a function of Gly concentrations, and fitted to a standard form of the Hill equation (y = ymax ([Gly]nH/[Gly]nH + EC50nH). The EC50 for Gly was 26 ± 4 μm, with a Hill coefficient (nH) of 2.0 ± 0.1 (Fig. 1C). These values concur with those reported previously (23Moorhouse A.J. Jacques P. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Schofield C.M. Jenkins A. Harrison N.L. J. Biol.

Each bar is the mean ± S.E. of 6–15 determinations in separate cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transfection of HEK-293 cells with R218Q GlyRA1 cDNA also led to the appearance of Gly-gated Cl- currents (Fig. 1B), although the agonist sensitivity of these currents was dramatically decreased when compared with that of homomeric wtGlyRA1 channels. Gly concentrations larger than 0.3 mm (1–30 mm) were required to activate Cl- currents in R218Q GlyRA1-transfected cells. Dose-response analysis revealed that the homomeric GlyRA1 channels carrying the R218Q mutation displayed a 200-fold decrease in Gly sensitivity when compared with wtGlyRA1 channels (EC50 of 5747 ± 270 μm), with no apparent change in the Hill coefficient nH (2.3 ± 0.2) (Fig. 1C). In addition, the maximal Cl- current density in cells transfected with the R218Q GlyRA1 cDNA (19.6 ± 8.9 pA/pF; n = 26) was markedly decreased when compared with that of wtGLyRA1-transfected cells (204.7 ± 32.9 pA/pF; n = 20; p < 0.05; see also Fig. 5).The two other HE-associated GlyRA1 mutations, V260M and Q266H, caused a more modest 5-fold increase in the EC50 for the agonist Gly (the EC50 was 135 ± 3 μm for V260M and 129 ± 8 μm for Q266H mutants) (Fig. 1C). Also in this case, no significant differences were detected in the Hill coefficients of V260M (nH = 1.7 ± 0.2) and Q266H (nH = 1.6 ± 0.2) GlyRA1 receptors when compared with wtGlyRA1 receptors.To gain further insight into the molecular defect prompted by the R218Q mutation, we measured the rates of channel activation, desensitization, and deactivation by fitting with a single exponential function the early phases of agonist (30 mm Gly)-induced current activation, the time course of agonist (30 mm Gly)-induced current desensitization, and the current decay upon agonist (3 mm) removal in both wtGlyRA1 and R218Q channels. Comparison of these kinetic properties showed that wtGlyRA1 receptors displayed an increased activation rate and a faster desensitization rate during agonist exposure when compared with GlyRA1 R218Q channels (Fig. 1, D and E), without significant changes in the deactivation rate upon removal of the agonist (Fig. 1E).Taurine and β-Alanine Sensitivity of HE-causing GlyRA1 Mutants—β-amino acids such as β-alanine (β-ALA) and taurine (TAU) behave as agonists at wtGlyR, but they appear to be of lower efficacy than Gly in some mutant receptors, acting as partial agonists (25Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Langosch D. Laube B. Rundstrom N. Schmieden V. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4223-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the peak Cl- currents elicited by exposure to 3 mm β-ALA or TAU in wtGlyRA1 receptors were similar in amplitude to those elicited by an identical Gly concentration (Fig. 2, B and C). By contrast, the currents elicited by both β-ALA and TAU in GlyRA1 carrying the V260M or the Q266H mutation were significantly smaller than those triggered by an identical concentration of Gly (3 mm) in the same cells (Fig. 2, A–C). In cells expressing GlyRA1 subunits carrying the R218Q mutation, 3 mm TAU or β-ALA application failed to elicit detectable Cl- currents (Fig. 2A). In the large majority of the R218Q-transfected cells, perfusion with a higher β-ALA concentration (30 mm) also failed to elicit measurable Cl- currents. In the only three cells in which these currents were clearly above background, the Iβ-ALA/IGly ratio was 0.13 ± 0.03 (p < 0.05 versus controls) (Fig. 2B); in R218Q-transfected cells, 30 mm TAU failed to activate measurable Cl- currents (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Taurine and β-alanine sensitivity of GlyRA1 mutants. A, whole cell current responses to the application of Gly, TAU, and β-ALA (each at 3 mm) in the same cell expressing wt or mutant GlyRA1 subunits. B and C, Iβ-ALA/IGly (B) and ITAU/IGly (C) ratios in wt and GlyRA1 mutants, as indicated. The ratios of the peak current amplitude elicited by 3 mm β-ALA/3 mm Gly and 3 mm TAU/3 mm Gly (for wt, V260M, and Q266H) or by 30 mm β-ALA/30 mm Gly and 30 mm TAU/30 mm Gly (for R218Q) are plotted in B and C, respectively. Each bar is the mean ± S.E. of 3–8 determinations in separate cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Strychnine-induced Blockade of GlyRA1 Channels Carrying the R218Q Mutation—Strychnine (STR) is an antagonist of Gly, which is known to bind at sites that partially overlap the agonist binding site on the GlyR (1Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Laube B. Maksay G. Schemm R. Betz H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Schmieden V. Kuhse J. Betz H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The competitive nature of STR-induced antagonism is shown in Fig. 3A. Cl- currents carried by channels composed of wtGlyRA1 subunits were activated by 30 μm Gly, an agonist concentration close to the EC50. During agonist application, 400 nm STR caused a rapid inhibition of the Gly-gated Cl- currents, which were almost fully abolished. The time course of STR-induced Cl- current inhibition reflects the kinetics of antagonist binding to its site on the receptor, which depend upon antagonist concentration. Lower STR concentrations (100 nm) also inhibited Glygated Cl- currents, although the time required to reach steadystate inhibition was much longer (data not shown). Upon removal of 400 nm STR, and in the continuous presence of the agonist, the Cl- current amplitude recovered slowly, reflecting the kinetics of unbinding of the antagonist from its receptor. When a supramaximal Gly concentration (6 mm, 200-fold higher than the EC50) was applied, 400 nm STR did not inhibit the agonist-induced current in wtGlyRA1 channels, consistent with the competitive nature of STR blockade.Fig. 3Blockade of wt and R218Q GlyRA1 channels by strychnine. A, whole cell current responses to Gly (30 μm, left panel;6mm, right panel) application in cells expressing wtGlyRA1 subunits. In the trace labeled with an empty square, 400 nm STR was co-applied with Gly; in the traces labeled with a filled square, no STR was co-applied with Gly (control). B, whole cell current response to 6 mm Gly application in a cell expressing R218Q GlyRA1 subunits. 400 nm STR was co-applied with Gly. C, left panel, whole cell current response to 30 μm Gly application in a cell expressing wtGlyRA1 subunits. Right panel, whole cell current response to 30 μm Gly in the same cell, after preincubation for 1 min with 400 nm STR. D, whole cell current response to 6 mm Gly application in the same cell expressing R218Q GlyRA1 subunits in control conditions (left panel) or after preincubation for 1 min with 400 nm STR (right panel). The same experiments were performed in at least three additional cells, with comparable results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In GlyRA1 channels carrying the R218Q mutation, 400 nm STR also inhibited the Cl- currents activated by Gly, with kinetics similar to those observed in wtGlyRA1 (Fig. 3B). In these experiments, similarly to those described for wtGlyRA1 channels, a concentration of Gly close to the EC50 (6 mm) for GlyRA1 R218Q channels was used to activate Cl- currents.In cells expressing R218Q GlyRA1 subunits, preincubation with 400 nm STR markedly reduced the response to 6 mm Gly (always in the presence of 400 nm STR) (Fig. 3C); the peak amplitude of the Cl- current elicited by 6 mm Gly in the presence of 400 nm STR was 8.0 ± 1.1% that of control (n = 4). This result was very similar to that obtained in cells expressing wtGlyRA1 subunits using the EC50 concentration of 30 μm (Fig. 3C), in which the peak amplitude of the Cl- current elicited by 30 μm Gly in the presence of 400 nm STR was 5.3 ± 1.7% (n = 5) of those recorded in the absence of STR. Measurements of the true equilibrium dissociation constant for STR by the method of Schild (27Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 28Lewis T.M. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Gardiner R.M. Schoepfer R. Rees M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 25-40Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were precluded in GlyRA1 R218Q channels due to the very low potency of Gly, requiring the use of concentrations higher than 10 mm to elicit even small currents.Membrane Localization of GlyRA1 Subunits Carrying HE Mutations—To determine whether the HE-causing mutations modified membrane insertion of GlyRA1 subunits, in addition to causing changes in the functional properties of correctly processed channels, Western blots were performed in total cell lysates and streptavidin-isolated plasma membrane proteins from HEK-293 cells transfected with the cDNAs encoding wtGlyRA1 or mutant GlyRs. The mAb4a monoclonal antibody was used, which recognizes an extracellular epitope (amino acids 96–105) shared by all GlyRA subunits; GlyRA1 subunits were revealed by the appearance of an immunoreactive band of an approximate molecular mass of 48 kDa (29Saul B. Kuner T. Sobetzko D. Brune W. Hanefeld F. Meinck H.M. Becker C.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This band was not detected in extracts from untransfected HEK-293 cells (data not shown).The intensity of this 48-kDa band did not show significant differences between cells expressing wtGlyRA1 subunits or GlyRA1 subunits carrying the V260M or the Q266H mutation, both in total lysates (Fig. 4A) and in streptavidin-isolated plasma membrane proteins (Fig. 4B). By contrast, cells expressing GlyRA1 R218Q subunits showed a significant decrease in the intensity of this 48-kDa immunoreactive band, both in total lysates (Fig. 4A) and in isolated plasma membrane fractions (Fig. 4B) when compared with wtGlyRA1-expressing cells. In fact, densitometric analysis revealed that the intensity ratios between the 48-kDa band in total lysates and the band corresponding to α-tubulin (∼55 kDa) in total lysates were 2.61 ± 0.94, 1.65 ± 0.45, 1.88 ± 0.64, and 0.46 ± 0.17 for cells transfected with wt, V260M, Q266H, and R218Q GlyRA1 cDNAs, respectively (n = 4; p < 0.05 between R218Q GlyRA1- and wtGlyRA1-transfected cells).

https://openalex.org/W1971017769,"Two isoforms of caveolin-1, α and β, had been thought to be generated by alternative translation initiation of an mRNA (FL mRNA), but we showed previously that a variant mRNA (5′V mRNA) encodes the β isoform specifically (Kogo, H., and Fujimoto, T. (2000) FEBS Lett. 465, 119–123). In the present study, we demonstrated strong correlation between the expression of the caveolin-1 protein isoforms and mRNA variants in culture cells and the developing mouse lung. The α isoform protein and FL mRNA were expressed constantly during the lung development, whereas expression of the β isoform protein and 5′V mRNA was negligible in the fetal lung before 17.5 days post-coitum, and markedly increased simultaneously at 18.5 days post coitum, when the alveolar type I cells started to differentiate. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the cell type-specific expression of the two isoforms; the alveolar type I cell expresses the β isoform predominantly, while the endothelium harbors the α isoform chiefly. The mutually exclusive expression of caveolin-1 isoforms was verified by Western blotting of the selective plasma membrane preparation obtained from the endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells. The present result indicates that the two caveolin-1 isoforms are generated from distinct mRNAs in vivo and that their production is regulated independently at the transcriptional level. The result also suggests that the α and β isoforms of caveolin-1 may have unique physiological functions.

Caveolae are small invaginations of the plasma membrane and have been implicated in many cell functions, including endocytosis, cholesterol transport, signal transduction, and tumor suppression (for reviews, see Refs. 1Anderson R.G.W.

Although caveolae are present in most tissues, lung has abundant caveolae in both endothelial and alveolar type I cells. Caveolins (caveolin-1, -2, and -3) are major constituents of caveolae (5Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W.

Among them, caveolin-1 was discovered first and has been characterized most extensively. Caveolin-1 has been shown to interact with many signaling proteins by the scaffolding domain (8Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 9Liu P. Rudick M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) appears to be related to the unique lipidic composition of the caveolar membrane and its involvement in cholesterol transport (11Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 49: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of caveolin-1 is sufficient for de novo formation of caveolae in cells lacking this organelle (12Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that caveolin-1 is an indispensable protein for both structure and function of caveolae. There are two isoforms of caveolin-1, termed α and β. They are identical except for the additional 31 amino acids of the α isoform at its N terminus. The two isoforms were reported to show an overlapping, but slightly different subcellular distribution in culture cells (13Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Our detailed observation by immunogold electron microscopy of a freeze fracture replica revealed that the α isoform preferentially distributed to caveolae with deep invagination in cultured fibroblasts (14Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Nomura R. Une T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific phosphorylation of the α isoform in v-Src transformed cells (15Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and that of the β isoform by insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 cells have been reported (17Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Mastick C.C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Despite these differences between the two isoforms, the β isoform has been generally considered to be a by-product formed by translation initiation from the second AUG codon (13Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In addition, the specific function of the β isoform is hard to speculate under the current knowledge, as most functional domains, i.e. those related to membrane attachment, oligomer formation, intracellular trafficking, and inhibitory interaction with many signaling molecules, are common in the two isoforms (18Machleidt T. Li W.P. Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21605-21617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). As a consequence, most experiments on the involvement of caveolin-1 in various cell functions have dealt only with the α isoform, leaving the functional significance of the β isoform elusive. Previously, we identified an mRNA variant of caveolin-1, termed 5′V, which specifically encodes the β isoform (20Kogo H. Fujimoto T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The result indicates that the expression of the β isoform is regulated independently from that of the α isoform. But to the best of our knowledge, preferential suppression of the α isoform by active c-Src (21Ko Y.G. Liu P. Pathak R.K. Craig L.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that of the β isoform in follicular thyroid carcinoma (22Aldred M.A. Ginn-Pease M.E. Morrison C.D. Popkie A.P. Gimm O. Hoang-Vu C. Krause U. Dralle H. Jhiang S.M. Plass C. Eng C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2864-2871PubMed Google Scholar) have been the only examples of differential regulation. In the present study, we demonstrated that the production of the two caveolin-1 isoforms is regulated at the transcriptional level by showing the correlation between the expression of the protein isoforms and the corresponding mRNAs in culture cells and the mouse tissue in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the α and β isoforms of caveolin-1 are expressed in the endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells of the mouse lung, respectively, in a mutually exclusive manner. This result supports the contention of Ramirez et al. (23Ramirez M.I. Pollack L. Millien G. Cao Y.X. Hinds A. Williams M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which suggested the expression of caveolin-1β in the fetal and neonatal alveolar epithelial cell based on the absence of caveolin-1α. Our result suggests that the two isoforms may have distinct physiological functions in different cell types. Culture Cells and Animals—A preadipocyte cell line, ST-13 (24Hiragun A. Sato M. Mitsui H. In Vitro. 1980; 16: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Fumio Fukai (Tokyo University of Science). 3T3-L1 (JCRB 9014) was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). Pam212 (25Yuspa S.H. Hawley-Nelson P. Koehler B. Stanley J.R. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 4694-4703PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Koji Hashimoto (Ehime University). ST-13 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% calf serum. 3T3-L1 and Pam212 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse embryos were obtained by breeding BALB/c mice. The presence of a vaginal plug at noon was considered as gestational day 0.5. Lungs were isolated from embryos at gestational days 16.5 (E16), 17.5 (E17), 18.5 (E18), and 19.5 (E19) and from mice at the postnatal age of 1 day, 3 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months. Wistar rats weighing 100–150 g were used for isolating the plasma membrane from pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. All experiments using laboratory animals were approved by the University Committee in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation in Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine. RNA Extraction and Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Total RNA of culture cells and mouse lung was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The template for the caveolin-1 antisense probe was subcloned into a pSPT18 plasmid (Roche Applied Science). This probe corresponds to a 294-bp sequence of mouse caveolin-1 5′V mRNA (bp 31–324 in AB029930). Cyclophilin was used as an internal control probe. The template for the cyclophilin antisense probe (bp 50–180 in X52803) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR and subcloned into a pBlue-script II plasmid (Stratagene). Antisense riboprobes were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and DIG 1The abbreviations used are: DIG, digoxigenin; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MBS, MES-buffered saline; HBSS, HEPES-buffered sucrose solution. RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science). A cDNA fragment of FL (bp 28–614 in AB029929) and that of 5′V (bp 31–662 in AB029930) were subcloned into a pSPT18 plasmid for the synthesis of sense caveolin-1 RNAs, which were transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) analysis of caveolin-1 mRNA was performed using RPA III kit (Ambion) with DIG-labeled riboprobes according to the manufacturer's instruction using 10 μg of total RNAs and 1 ng of antisense riboprobes per reaction. The protected RNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea and electro-transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science). The DIG-labeled RNA fragments were detected with a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-DIG Fab fragment conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) and SuperSignal™ Chemiluminescent System (Pierce). The chemiluminescent signals were analyzed using Kodak Digital Science™ Image Station 440CF and 1D Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Western Blotting—Culture cells and the plasma membrane preparations from the rat lung were directly dissolved with a SDS-containing buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, pH 6.8). Mouse lungs were homogenized in a buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before being treated with SDS sample buffer. Ten μg of proteins per lane were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blotted membranes of culture cells and developing mouse lungs were probed with anti-caveolin-1 antibody (clone 2297: BD Transduction Laboratories, at 1:1,000 dilution) or anti-β-actin antibody (clone AC-15: Sigma, at 1:50,000 dilution). The membrane blotted with the plasma membrane preparation was additionally probed with anti-caveolin-1α antibody (sc-894 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) at 1:2,000 dilution), anti-caveolin-2 antibody (clone 65 (BD Transduction Laboratories) at 1:5,000 dilution), anti-α smooth muscle actin antibody (clone 1A4 (Sigma) at 1:1,000 dilution), and anti-PECAM-1 antibody (sc-1506 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) at 1:200 dilution). The membrane was further treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the reaction was visualized and analyzed as described above. Immunohistochemistry—Mouse lungs were fixed in neutral buffered 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, displaced with 1-butanol, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5-μm thickness were placed on silane-coated slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated through an ethanol gradient. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation at 90 °C for 20 min in Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories). The sections were incubated with normal serum as blocking reagent and then with the following antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Three caveolin-1 antibodies, rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibodies (C13630 (BD Transduction Laboratories) at 1:100 dilution; sc-894 at 1:300 dilution), and mouse monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (clone 2297 at 1:50 dilution) were used. These antibodies exhibit a differential affinity to the two isoforms of caveolin-1 as reported previously (14Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Nomura R. Une T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Goat polyclonal anti-PECAM-1 antibody (sc-1506 at 1:50 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody (clone 1A4 at 1:400 dilution), hamster monoclonal anti-mouse gp38/T1α antibody (clone 8.1.1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) at 1:100 dilution) (26Farr A. Nelson A. Hosier S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Kotton D.N. Ma B.Y. Cardoso W.V. Sanderson E.A. Summer R.S. Williams M.C. Fine A. Development. 2001; 128: 5181-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse monoclonal anti-thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) antibody (clone 8G7G3/1 (Neomarkers) at 1:20 dilution) (28Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) were used as markers for endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, alveolar epithelial type I, and type II cells, respectively. Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-hamster antibodies (Molecular Probes), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used for the fluorescent detection of the antigens. Negative control staining was performed with normal mouse and rabbit sera at 1:100 dilution replacing the primary antibodies. Isolation of Endothelial and Alveolar Epithelial Cell Plasma Membranes—The luminal plasma membrane of the rat lung endothelium was silica-coated by perfusing the cationized colloidal silica solution from the pulmonary artery as reported previously (29Chaney L.K. Jacobson B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10062-10072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The silica coating of the alveolar epithelial cell plasma membrane was performed by filling and removing the solution manually through trachea using a 10-ml syringe fitted with a 16-gauge intravenous catheter. The lung with catheterized trachea was excised and lavaged four times with 5 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 2.5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4) to remove macrophages and then twice with 5 ml of MES-buffered saline (MBS: 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0). The lung was then filled with 5 ml of 1% cationic colloidal silica in MBS and settled for 1 min, followed by lavaging twice with 5 ml of MBS to remove excess colloidal silica. The lung was then filled with 5 ml of 1% sodium polyacrylate in MBS and settled for 1 min, followed by lavaging twice with 5 ml of HEPES-buffered sucrose solution (HBSS: 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The silica-coated lung (about 1 g) was minced and homogenized in 5 ml of cold HBSS and processed as reported previously (31Stolz D.B. Ross M.A. Salem H.M. Mars W.M. Michalopoulos G.K. Enomoto K. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In brief, after filtration through 200-μm nylon mesh, the homogenate was mixed with 75% (w/v) Nycodenz (Nycomed AS) to make a 50% final solution and was layered over a cushion of 70% Nycodenz in HBSS and then overlaid with HEPES-buffered saline. After a centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet formed at the bottom of the tube was washed with HBSS. To obtain a purer preparation, the pellets were resuspended with 50% Nycodenz solution and recentrifuged over a 70% Nycodenz cushion. The silica pellets were dissolved with a standard SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Detection of Two Caveolin-1 mRNAs by RPA—In a previous study, we identified two mRNAs for caveolin-1. They were named as FL and 5′V and were thought to encode the α and β isoforms, respectively (20Kogo H. Fujimoto T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether the isoform production is principally regulated at the transcriptional level or caused by alternative translation initiation (13Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). If the former is the case, the expression of the α and β isoform proteins should be correlated with that of the FL and 5′V mRNAs. To examine this, we quantified isoform proteins and mRNAs. For quantitative detection of two mRNAs in a single assay, we employed the RPA using the DIG-labeled antisense riboprobe that hybridizes to 5′V mRNA with 293 bases and to FL mRNA with 168 bases. We confirmed that the two caveolin-1 mRNAs can be quantitated by this method using known amounts of synthesized sense RNAs as samples (Fig. 1). Expression of Caveolin-1 Isoforms and mRNAs in Murine Culture Cells—We screened several mouse cell lines showing various expression ratios of caveolin-1 isoforms and present here the results of three culture cell lines (Fig. 2). The ratio of signal intensity for the two isoforms (β/α) by Western blotting (the mean ± S.D., n = 4) was 3.59 ± 0.62 for ST13, 0.55 ± 0.10 for 3T3-L1, and 0.03 ± 0.04 for Pam212 (Fig. 2, WB). The signal ratio of two mRNAs (5′V/FL) by RPA (the mean ± S.D., n = 3) was 6.00 ± 2.63 for ST13, 0.80 ± 0.24 for 3T3-L1, and 0.36 ± 0.11 for Pam212 (Fig. 2, RPA). The expression ratio of protein isoforms and mRNA variants was obviously correlated each other, suggesting that the α and β isoforms are produced from FL and 5′V mRNAs, respectively, in these cell lines. Expression of Caveolin-1 Isoforms and mRNAs during the Murine Lung Development—Next, we examined the caveolin-1 expression in the developing mouse lung. We found that the β isoform was hardly detectable at E16 and E17, but became prominent at E18 and thereafter (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the α isoform was already detectable at E16 and constantly expressed during the lung development (Fig. 3A). The expression of the two mRNAs also showed a similar change; namely, the expression of 5′V mRNA increased drastically between E17 and E18, while that of FL mRNA was rather constant (Fig. 3B), consistent with the assumption that the 5′V mRNA is responsible for the production of the β isoform. Quantitative analysis of the signal intensity ratio for caveolin-1 isoforms (β/α, Fig. 3C) and that of mRNA variants (5′V/FL, Fig. 3D) clearly shows the marked up-regulation of the β isoform protein and 5′V mRNA between E17 and E18. The protein β/α ratio and the mRNA 5′V/FL ratio both reached a plateau around birth and remained the same in the following ages at least until 12 months old (Fig. 3, C and D, part of the data is not shown). The apparent continuous increase of the β/α ratio after birth in Fig. 3A with the same protein loading is due to saturation of the α isoform signal in the older aged mice. By avoiding signal saturation by a decreased sample loading (Fig. 3A′), the β/α ratio remained the same after birth as shown in Fig. 3C. Immunohistochemical Identification of Caveolin-1-expressing Cell Types in the Developing Mouse Lung—To examine whether the expression of the β isoform increases specifically in some cell type at E18, we histologically observed caveolin-1-positive cells in the developing mouse lung by immunofluorescence labeling. In the lung at E16 and E17, in which the α isoform protein and FL mRNA were dominant, caveolin-1 was detected in cells in the lung mesenchyme (Fig. 4A), as well as in the endothelial cell of large blood vessels (Fig. 4, A and B, asterisks). The cells positive for caveolin-1 in the mesenchyme were identified as the endothelial cell of developing small vessels because they expressed endothelial markers, PECAM-1 (Fig. 4D) and eNOS (data not shown). This result is consistent with the previous report on the expression of caveolin-1α in the fetal lung (23Ramirez M.I. Pollack L. Millien G. Cao Y.X. Hinds A. Williams M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 was labeled only weakly in other cell types such as the smooth muscle cell of the blood vessel (Fig. 4E, asterisk) and of the bronchial tubule (Fig. 4E, br) and the interstitial fibroblast. The bronchial epithelium (Fig. 4, A and B, br) was negative for caveolin-1. We subsequently examined the expression of caveolin-1 in the alveolar epithelium. In the fetal lung, the epithelial cell of pulmonary acinus, but not that of bronchium, was labeled positively by the antibody to mouse gp38/T1α (Fig. 5, A–C, gp38), which is a specific marker for the apical surface of the alveolar type I cells in the adult lung (27Kotton D.N. Ma B.Y. Cardoso W.V. Sanderson E.A. Summer R.S. Williams M.C. Fine A. Development. 2001; 128: 5181-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acinar epithelium at E17 was mostly the cuboidal type II precursor cell (32Ten Have-Opbroek A.A. Exp. Lung Res. 1991; 17: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and was either negative or only weakly stained by a rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (C13630) recognizing both the α and β isoforms (Fig. 5A, ac). A dramatic morphological change of the acinar tubule occurred at E18; the acinar lumen enlarged tremendously and the alveolar epithelial cell became flattened (Fig. 5, B and C, ac) (32Ten Have-Opbroek A.A. Exp. Lung Res. 1991; 17: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The flat alveolar epithelial cell was labeled positively by C13630 (Fig. 5B, arrows) but not significantly by another rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody, sc-894, which is specific to the α-isoform (Fig. 5C, arrows). This result indicates that the marked induction of the β isoform protein and 5′V mRNA occurs in the alveolar type I cell at E18 as the cell starts to differentiate. Immunohistochemical Demonstration of the Differential Expression of Caveolin-1 Isoforms—To clearly visualize the differential expression of the two caveolin-1 isoforms in different cell types, we performed double labeling by using a combination of the two anti-caveolin-1 antibodies, 2297 and sc-894. While sc-894 recognizes only the α isoform, 2297 recognizes both the α and β isoforms evenly. In the lung at E16 and E17, the labeling by sc-894 and 2297 was almost indistinguishable, which result is consistent with the predominance of the α isoform at this stage (Fig. 6A). A little difference was observed in the vascular smooth muscle cell, which appeared reddish compared with the endothelial cell in the merged picture (data not shown). On the other hand, at E18, a marked difference between sc-894 (Fig. 6B, green) and 2297 (Fig. 6B, red) was observed; the alveolar epithelial cell was positive with 2297 but not with sc-894 (Fig. 6B, arrows). We confirmed this result by using another anti-caveolin-1 antibody, C13630, which labels the α isoform better than the β isoform (14Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Nomura R. Une T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At E19, whereas 2297 labeled the alveolar epithelium and the vascular endothelium in a similar intensity (Fig. 6C, red, arrows), C13630 labeled the endothelium preferentially (Fig. 6C, green, arrows). The difference of the isoform ratio in the two cell types is clearly visible in the merged picture (Fig. 6C); the alveolar epithelium was stained in orange or red, whereas the endothelium was stained in yellow or green. We also assessed the expression of caveolin-1 isoforms in the adult lung (Fig. 7). The alveolar type I cell of the adult lung recognized by anti-gp38 (red) was labeled by 2297 (green), thus resulting in yellow coloring (Fig. 7A, arrows), but it was not labeled by sc-894, resulting in red coloring (Fig. 7B, arrows). By the double staining with two different combinations of anti-caveolin-1 antibodies, the adult alveolar type I cell was intensely labeled by 2297 (Fig. 7, C and D, red, arrows), and only weakly by C13630 (Fig. 7D, green, arrows), but not by sc-894 (Fig. 7C, green, arrows), resulting in orange (Fig. 7D) and red (Fig. 7C) coloring, respectively, in the merged picture. The endothelial cell was intensely labeled by all caveolin-1 antibodies and thus it appeared yellow or green (Fig. 7, C and D). The lack of labeling by sc-894 in the alveolar type I epithelium was observed consistently in 3-, 6-, and 12-month old mice. This result contradicts the previous work (23Ramirez M.I. Pollack L. Millien G. Cao Y.X. Hinds A. Williams M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which showed the α isoform in the adult alveolar type I epithelium. Most likely this discrepancy was caused by the method applied; we used fluorochrome-labeled antibody and confocal laser microscopy, whereas the cited work (23Ramirez M.I. Pollack L. Millien G. Cao Y.X. Hinds A. Williams M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) used tyramide amplification combined with diaminobenzidine coloring. Due to the thinness of the adult epithelium, it is difficult to observe it differentially from the endothelium by the latter method. In conjunction with the immunoblotting result described below, we concluded that the adult alveolar epithelium contains little, if any, caveolin-1α. All together, our immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated that the alveolar type I cell expresses the β isoform of caveolin-1 predominantly in both the fetal and adult mouse lung. The alveolar type II cell identified by the presence of TTF-1 (28Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) was negative for both the α and β isoform of caveolin-1 (data not shown). We tried to examine the cell type-specific expression of FL and 5′V mRNAs by in situ hybridization using two DIG-labeled antisense riboprobes, which correspond to the unique 5′ ends of FL mRNA (1–117 in AB029929) and of 5′V mRNA (31–170 in AB029930); however, they were not sensitive enough to detect the mRNAs in tissue sections (data not shown). Selective Isolation of the Plasma Membrane from the Endothelium and the Alveolar Epithelium by Silica Coating Technique—To verify the cell type-specific expression of the caveolin-1 isoforms in the lung, we isolated the plasma membrane selectively from the endothelial and the alveolar epithelial cells by silica coating technique (see “Experimental Procedures”) and analyzed the expressio"

Until now, there have been no data that identify a particular region of the cytoplasmic tail of integrin subunits as being responsible specifically for promoting the invasive activity of tumor cells. In this report, we show that amino acids with the sequence EKQKVDLSTDC, which are the C-terminal residues of the integrin β6 subunit, promote αvβ6-dependent invasion in a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9-dependent fashion. This same peptide sequence, when expressed at the cytoplasmic end of the β3 integrin subunit, was able to enhance αvβ3-mediated invasive and enzymatic activity of tumor cells in an MMP-2-dependent fashion. Our results show that these 11 amino acids, when expressed at the C terminus of the β subunit, are responsible for regulating the activity of invasion-promoting degradative enzymes, whereas the specific MMP involved in this cellular behavior is dependent on the context of the remainder of the β integrin subunit.

A major goal of cancer research is to understand the molecular basis of tumor cell invasion, because this process represents a critical step in tumor metastasis, the most devastating aspect of malignancy. Integrins are key components of the invasive cancer cell in which they serve as the principal mediators of adhesion to, migration across, and invasion through, the extracellular matrix. In this article, we report that a discrete region of the cytoplasmic tail of the β6 subunit is essential, and sufficient, to promote invasion by carcinoma cells that express this integrin subunit.Expression of the integrin αvβ6 heterodimer is restricted to epithelial cells, where it serves as a receptor for fibronectin, tenascin, and latency-associated peptide, a protein involved in the maintenance of tumor growth factor-β in an inactive state. Integrin αvβ6 levels are up-regulated in wound healing and in various epithelial neoplasms (1Cass D.L. Bullard K.M. Sylvester K.G. Yang E.Y. Sheppard D. Herlyn M. Adzick N.S. J. Pediatr.

Moreover, αvβ6-mediated production and regulation of various MMPs, 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; MEM, minimal essential medium.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; MEM, minimal essential medium. specifically MMP-9 and MMP-3, also have been reported in several tumor types and in untransformed keratinocytes (9Thomas G.J.

Further still, αvβ6 has been implicated in the regulatory control of the urokinase-plasminogen activator proteolytic cascade (15Ahmed N. Pansino F. Clyde R. Murthi P. Quinn M.A. Rice G.E. Agrez M.V. Mok S. Baker M.S. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, αvβ6 is associated intrinsically with invasion that is regulated, in part, by the activity of certain proteases of both the MMP and the serine protease families.Integrins modulate cell behavior in response to a range of events largely by generating signals via their cytoplasmic tails. There is a large degree of protein homology between the different integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic domains, particularly between cytodomains-1, -2, and -3 (Fig. 1), these being regions of the molecule that are involved in the recruitment of integrins to focal adhesions and in modulating integrin affinity (16Reszka A.A.

Commun. 1994; 2: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to this conservation of primary sequence, the β6 subunit contains an unique C-terminal 11 amino acid sequence EKQKVDLSTDC (Fig. 1). We have demonstrated recently that this motif is essential for oral SCC invasion. 2M. R. Morgan, G. J. Thomas, D. Joshi, M. Jazayeri, I. R. Hart, and J. F. Marshall, submitted for publication.2M. R. Morgan, G. J. Thomas, D. Joshi, M. Jazayeri, I. R. Hart, and J. F. Marshall, submitted for publication. This domain also has been implicated in the ligand-independent regulation of MMP-9 in a colon cancer model (18Niu J. Gu X. Turton J. Meldrum C. Howard E.W. Agrez M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the density-dependent regulation of αvβ6 cell surface expression (19Niu J. Dorahy D.J. Gu X. Scott R.J. Draganic B. Ahmed N. Agrez M.V. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the role of the unique β6 C-terminal 11 amino acids in the regulation of MMPs and tumor cell invasion. We demonstrate, for the first time, by generating cells expressing chimeric integrins, that this unique, 11-residue motif not only is essential for αvβ6-mediated invasion but also is sufficient to induce an enhanced invasive phenotype, through up-regulation of gelatinases. It is notable that the precise gelatinase up-regulated is determined not by the 11 amino acid sequence but by the residual integrin cytoplasmic tail with which the 11 amino-acids are associated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—The low αvβ6-expressing oral SCC cell line, V3, was generated by transfection of αv cDNA into the αv-negative oral SCC cell line H357 (20Prime S.S.

We have created the C1, VB6, and V3B6Δ11aa cell lines previously through retroviral transduction into V3 cells of pBabe-puro retroviruses encoding either the puromycin resistance gene alone, wild-type human β6 cDNA, or a truncation mutant β6 lacking the C-terminal 11 amino acids, respectively (8Thomas G.J.

F. Marshall, submitted for publication. In this study, a further panel of oral SCC cell lines was generated, using similar techniques, expressing full-length wild-type human β3 or a chimeric extension mutant of human β3, whereby the cDNA sequence encoding the C-terminal 11 residues of β6 was added to that encoding the carboxyl terminus of wild-type β3. These cell lines were designated V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa, respectively. C1, the vector control cells, were used as negative control cells. All SCC cells were maintained in keratinocyte growth medium as described elsewhere (8Thomas G.J. Lewis M.P. Whawell S.A. Russell A. Sheppard D. Hart I.R. Speight P.M. Marshall J.F. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 67-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Generation of Oral SCC Cell Populations Expressing Wild-type or Extension Mutant β3—Using standard molecular techniques, the wild-type β3 sequence was excised from the pCDM8 vector (CD3A; a kind gift of Joe Loftus, Mayo Clinic) using restriction enzymes and ligated into the pBabepuro retroviral expression vector (β3pBabepuro). Wild-type β3, in the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), was used as a PCR template to generate cDNA encoding an extension mutant of the β3 subunit extended by the C-terminal 11 residues of β6 (β3Σ11aa) (Fig. 1). PCR primers also included 5′-XhoI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites (bold and underlined) to aid cloning. The forward primer (Beta3F) used was 5′-CCCCCCCTCGAGCGGGAGGCGGACGAGATGCGAGC-3′ and the reverse primer (Beta3/6R) used was 5′-CCCCCCCTCGAGCTAGCAATCTGTGGAAAGGTCTACCTTTTGTTTTTCAGTGCCCCGGTACGTGATATTGGTGAAG-3′. The β3Σ11aa PCR product was ligated into the pCDNA3.1 shuttle vector (Invitrogen). Restriction digest of the encoded XhoI sites was used to excise the β3Σ11aa cDNA, and this restriction fragment was blunt-end ligated into the SalI restriction site of the pBabepuro multiple cloning site, thus generating β3Σ11aapBabepuro.Retroviruses encoding either β3 or β3Σ11aa were generated as described by Thomas et al. (8Thomas G.J. Lewis M.P. Whawell S.A. Russell A. Sheppard D. Hart I.R. Speight P.M. Marshall J.F. J. Investig.

Puromycin-resistant cells were treated with mouse anti-αvβ3 antibodies (LM609; Chemicon International, Harrow, UK) and sorted using magnetic beads (sheep anti-mouse IgG; Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway) to enhance the levels of cell surface αvβ3 expressed by the cell populations. Expression levels of the β3 integrin heterodimers were determined by flow cytometry.Flow Cytometry—Standard flow cytometric techniques were used to assess levels of cell surface integrins on the various derivative lines. Cells grown on tissue culture plastic were detached with trypsin/EDTA (0.25% (w/v), 5 mm) and washed twice with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline (0.1/0.1 solution). Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 0.1/0.1 solution. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) (1:200 final dilution) was added to the cells at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed in 0.1/0.1 solution three times, resuspended to 0.5 ml, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), using Cellquest software, collecting 1 × 104 events.Indirect Immunofluorescence—In a 24-well plate, 13-mm diameter glass coverslips (Chance Propper Ltd., Smethwick, UK), previously coated with 5 μg/ml vitronectin (Sigma, Poole, UK), in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37 °C, were seeded with 2 × 104 cells. After 24 h in keratinocyte growth medium, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline then treated with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at ambient temperature before incubation in 0.1/0.1 solution for 20 min. LM609 primary antibody (anti-αvβ3, 5 μg/ml; Chemicon International Ltd., Harrow, UK), was added to cells for 60 min at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed three times in 0.1/0.1 solution and cells incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) (1:200 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed once and actin was labeled using tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (100 ng/ml; Sigma) (10 min incubation at room temperature). Otherwise, cells were labeled with rabbit anti-human β3 (Chemicon International) (secondary antibody = goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes)) and counterstained for vinculin, using mouse anti-human vinculin (Sigma) and Alexa 568-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were washed three times, mounted in Mowiol 4–88 (Novabiochem, Nottingham, UK), using 100 mg/ml of Citifluor mountant (Citifluor Ltd., London), and visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510; Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK). To allow for direct comparison of levels of expression between different cell lines, the analysis parameters on the microscope were kept constant for all cell lines.Migration Assay—Haptotactic migration assays were performed using vitronectin-coated polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size, Transwell, Costar Corning Inc.). The undersides of the filters were coated in plasma vitronectin (Sigma: 10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed with α-MEM, and blocked for 30 min in migration buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin in α-MEM supplemented with 4 mm glutamine). For blocking experiments, cells were preincubated at 4 °C for 10 min in the presence of LM609 (anti-αvβ3; 5 μg/ml). Control cells were incubated with the anti-MHC class I mouse monoclonal antibody W6/32 (5 μg/ml; a gift from Sir Walter Bodmer, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, UK). Cells (1 × 105) were added to the upper chamber of quadruplicate wells in 100 μl of migration buffer and 500 μl of migration buffer were added to the lower chamber. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After incubation, all cells were trypsin-detached separately from both the upper and lower chambers of the Transwell plates and counted on a CASY-1 cell counter (Schärfe System GmbH). Percentage migration was determined by the number of cells in the lower chamber relative to the total number of cells in the well. Random motility (toward bovine serum albumin) was subtracted from the total percentage migration to determine substrate-specific migration. Experiments were repeated three times, with quadruplicate wells for each treatment, with similar results.Analysis of MMP Secretion—Cells were allowed to attach to fibronectin- or vitronectin-coated 24-well plates in 500 μl of serum-free α-MEM. After 24 h, the supernatant was collected and analyzed by one of two methods. Levels of MMP-2 or MMP-9 secretion were measured by gelatin zymography as described previously (9Thomas G.J. Lewis M.P. Hart I.R. Marshall J.F. Speight P.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 92: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Thomas G.J. Poomsawat S. Lewis M.P. Hart I.R. Speight P.M. Marshall J.F. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 898-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MMP-9 levels were also assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Amersham Biosciences; used per manufacturer's instructions). Pro-MMP-9 was identified as a 92-kDa band on the gelatin-PAGE gel, whereas pro-MMP-2 was seen as a 72-kDa band. After collecting the conditioned medium, the adherent cells were trypsinized and counted to express protease activity relative to cell number and to achieve equal loading on each gel.Invasion Assay—70 μl of basement membrane-like matrix, Matrigel (BD Biosciences), diluted 1:2 with α-MEM, was allowed to set at 37 °C on the upper surface of a Transwell chamber. To the lower chamber was added 500 μl of keratinocyte growth medium, to act as a chemoattractant, and 1 × 105 cells were added in 200 μl of invasion buffer (α-MEM supplemented with 4 mm glutamine) on top of the Matrigel. After 48 h, all cells in the lower chamber were collected by trypsin detachment and counted on a CASY-1 cell counter. In some experiments, cells were pre-incubated on ice with 10 μg/ml function-blocking antibodies (LM609 (anti-αvβ3) or CA-4001 (anti-MMP-2; Chemicon International). Invasion was expressed relative to V3B3 or C1 cells. Antibody inhibition was expressed relative to the activity of cells in the presence of W6/32 control antibody.RESULTSThe C-terminal 11 Residues of the β6 Integrin Subunit Are Essential for αvβ6-Dependent MMP-9 Up-regulation—We have demonstrated previously that the amino acids EKQKVDLSTDC, which are located at the C terminus of the β6 subunit, are essential for αvβ6-dependent invasion by oral SCC cells. This was determined by comparing the invasive capacity of C1, VB6, and V3B6Δ11aa cell lines.2 Niu et al. (18Niu J. Gu X. Turton J. Meldrum C. Howard E.W. Agrez M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated, in a colon cancer model, that this same region of the molecule is required for ligand-independent up-regulation of pro-MMP-9. However, the behavior of an integrin in one cell line is not necessarily indicative of its behavior in another cell line (23Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the levels of pro-MMP-9 secreted by V3B6Δ11aa cells, when plated on fibronectin, versus those of VB6 or C1 cells, both by gelatin zymography (Fig. 2, A and B) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 2C). Zymographic analysis demonstrated that levels of secreted pro-MMP-9 were up-regulated in the VB6 cells relative to the C1-null transfectants (pro-MMP-9 levels: VB6, 100%; C1, 53.5%). We have reported previously that this increase is caused by ligand-dependent binding of αvβ6 (9Thomas G.J. Lewis M.P. Hart I.R. Marshall J.F. Speight P.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 92: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, this αvβ6-dependent up-regulation was not observed in V3B6Δ11aa cells (pro-MMP-9 levels: V3B6Δ11aa, 50.5%). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on supernatants taken from these cells confirmed these zymography results (Fig. 2C; VB6, 100%; C1, 68.5%; V3B6Δ11aa, 21.3%). Pro-MMP-2 was not detected by gelatin zymography of conditioned medium from C1, VB6, or V3B6Δ11aa cells (data not shown). These results seem to demonstrate that the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the β6 subunit are critical for αvβ6-dependent up-regulation of pro-MMP-9 in these oral SCC cells, an up-regulation that correlates with the invasive behavior of the different cell lines.2Fig. 2Examination of pro-MMP-9 levels of oral SCC cell lines.A, zymogram showing triplicate samples demonstrating secreted pro-MMP-9 bands. Levels of pro-MMP-9 were increased in the VB6 cells relative to both the C1 and V3B6Δ11aa cell lines. B, densitometric analysis of pro-MMP-9 zymographic band intensity relative to the cell number in each well. Results are expressed relative to MMP-9 expression for VB6 cells. Hence, VB6 = 100 ± 1.9%, C1 = 53.5 ± 6.6%, and V3B6Δ11aa = 50.5 ± 2.6%. Error bars represent standard deviation. C, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showing up-regulation of secreted MMP-9 by VB6 cells relative to both C1 and V3B6Δ11aa cells. MMP-9 expression: VB6 = 100%, C1 = 68.5%, and V3B6Δ11aa = 21.3%.

After several rounds of magnetic bead sorting, flow cytometry was performed to determine levels of cell surface αvβ3 expression. V3B3Σ11aa was seen to express levels of cell surface αvβ3Σ11aa mutant heterodimer similar to those at which the V3B3 cells express wild-type αvβ3 (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Immunofluorescent detection of αvβ3 and αvβ3Σ11aa.A, flow cytometric analysis of αvβ3 and αvβ3Σ11aa expression on V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa cells. Cells were labeled with LM609 (anti-αvβ3) followed by anti-mouse Alexa-488. Flow cytometry showed that both V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa cell lines expressed similar levels of αvβ3 or αvβ3Σ11aa heterodimer, respectively.

Both the V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa cell lines were seen to express similar levels of the αvβ3 integrin heterodimer. The pattern of αvβ3 localization in V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa cells was similar also, and the heterodimer appeared at the ends of actin filaments in focal adhesion-like structures (Fig. 3B). To confirm that these structures were focal adhesions, V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa cells were double-labeled for β3 and the focal adhesion-associated protein vinculin. Fig. 3, C and D, shows exact correlation between β3 or β3Σ11aa and vinculin, confirming that the focal distribution of αvβ3 at the ends of actin filaments actually was in focal adhesions. This provided the first indication that the αvβ3 and αvβ3Σ11aa heterodimers, expressed by these cell lines, were functional integrins.The C-terminal 11 Amino Acids of β6 Do Not Affect αvβ3-Dependent Adhesion or Migration—Adhesion to vitronectin was assessed in the C1, V3B3, and V3B3Σ11aa cell lines. The C1 cells achieved 6.52% adhesion, whereas the V3B3 cells demonstrated 38.60% adhesion and V3B3Σ11aa cells achieved 39.45% (data not shown). Thus, the wild-type and mutant αvβ3 heterodimers expressed in V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa can mediate adhesion to vitronectin to a comparable extent.To determine whether the addition of the EKQKVDLSTDC sequence to the C terminus of β3 would affect αvβ3-dependent migration, haptotactic migration toward vitronectin was measured in Transwell assays. Fig. 4 shows that migration toward vitronectin was similar and significantly enhanced for both the V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa cell lines (20.29 and 21.79%, respectively) compared with C1 cells that displayed only basal levels of migration (2.01%). Moreover, in the presence of an αvβ3-blocking antibody (LM609), V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa migration was reduced to basal levels (3.92 and 0%, respectively). Therefore, the wild-type and mutant αvβ3 heterodimers, in V3B3 and V3B3Σ11aa cells, are functional as vitronectin receptors and able to transduce signals required for ligand-binding, cell adhesion, and migration. Furthermore, the addition of EKQKVDLSTDC to the C terminus of β3, as a part of αvβ3Σ11aa, did not modulate αvβ3-dependent adherence or αvβ3-dependent migration as determined in these assays.Fig. 4Haptotactic migration toward vitronectin of C1, V3B3, and V3B3Σ11aa cells. Cells in the presence (open bars) or absence (filled bars) of LM609 (αvβ3-blocking antibody) were added to Transwell migration chambers coated on the under-side with vitronectin. After 16 h, the cells in the lower and upper chambers were counted and migration expressed as a fraction of the total (see “Experimental Procedures”). Histogram shows that expression of either αvβ3 or αvβ3Σ11aa confers an ability to migrate toward vitronectin that is largely absent in the αvβ3-negative C1 cells. The presence of LM609 abrogates this increased migratory ability. Results show a single experiment that is representative of three independent assays with similar results.

Fig. 5 shows that, relative to the C1 control cells (100%), invasion through Matrigel of V3B3Σ11aa cells (220.8%) was significantly higher than that of the V3B3 cell line (92.9%) (p = 0.0004).Fig. 5Invasion through Matrigel of C1, V3B3, and V3B3Σ11aa cells.

https://openalex.org/W2124924883,"A common human epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) polymorphism, αT663A, is present in the cytoplasmic C terminus of the α-subunit, although it is unclear whether this polymorphism segregates with blood pressure. We examined whether this polymorphism was associated with differences in functional Na+ channel expression. Whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild type channels (αT663βγ) were significantly ∼1.3–2.0-fold higher than currents measured in oocytes expressing channels with an Ala, Gly or Leu, or Lys at position α663. In contrast, differences in functional human ENaC expression were not observed with oocytes expressing channels having Thr (wild type), Ser, or Asp at this position. The surface expression of channels, measured using an epitope-tagged β-subunit, was significantly reduced in oocytes expressing αT663Aβγ when compared with oocytes expressing αT663βγ. The corresponding polymorphism was generated in the mouse α-subunit (mαA692T) and was not associated with differences in functional αβγ-mouse ENaC expression. The polymorphism is present in a region that is not well conserved between human and mouse. We generated a mouse/human chimera by replacement of the distal C terminus of the mouse α-subunit with the distal C terminus of the human α-subunit. Co-expression of this m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663A chimera with mouse βγ led to a significant reduction in whole cell Na+ currents and surface expression when compared with m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663-mβγ. Our results suggest that hαT663A is a functional polymorphism that affects human ENaC surface expression.

IntroductionEpithelial sodium channels (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; hENaC, human ENaC; mENaC, mouse ENaC; MBS, modified Barth's saline; TEV, two-electrode voltage clamp; BSA, bovine serum albumin; n.s., not significant. are expressed in principal cells in the late distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubule, where they serve as a final site for reabsorption of Na+ from the glomerular ultrafiltrate. Volume regulatory hormones, such as aldosterone, have a key role in modifying rates of renal tubular Na+ reabsorption through regulation of functional ENaC expression at the apical plasma membrane (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Google Scholar). Epithelial Na+ channels are composed of three structurally related subunits, termed α-, β-, and γ-ENaC that likely assemble as a α2,β1,γ1 tetramer (2Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Google Scholar, 3Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Google Scholar), although an alternative subunit stoichiometry has been proposed (4Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Google Scholar). The three subunits share limited (∼30–40%) sequence identity but share a common topology of two membrane-spanning domains and intracellular N and C termini (5Canessa C.M. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1682-C1690Google Scholar, 6Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Google Scholar, 7Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Google Scholar).Changes in ENaC functional expression are associated with alterations in blood pressure (8Hummler E. Curr. Hypertens. Rep. 2003; 5: 11-18Google Scholar, 9Hummler E. Horisberger J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G567-G571Google Scholar). Na+ channel gain-of-function mutations have been identified in patients with Liddle's syndrome, a disorder characterized by volume expansion, hypokalemia, and hypertension (10Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., J.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Google Scholar, 11Warnock D.G. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2001; 322: 302-307Google Scholar). ENaC loss-of-function mutations have been identified in patients with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism, a disorder characterized by volume depletion, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (12Chang S.S. Grunder S. Hanukoglu A. Rosler A. Mathew P.M. Hanukoglu I. Schild L. Lu Y. Shimkets R.A. Nelson-Williams C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 248-253Google Scholar, 13Saxena A. Hanukoglu I. Saxena D. Thompson R.J. Gardiner R.M. Hanukoglu A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3344-3350Google Scholar). Some common human ENaC polymorphisms may segregate with blood pressure (i.e. βT594M) (14Baker E.H. Dong Y.B. Sagnella G.A. Rothwell M. Onipinla A.K. Markandu N.D. Cappuccio F.P. Cook D.G. Persu A. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. Carter N.D. MacGregor G.A. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1388-1392Google Scholar), suggesting that ENaC polymorphisms that alter functional channel expression may contribute to the development of hypertension in the general population.A common polymorphism has been described in C terminus of the α-subunit of human ENaC (hENaC), αT663A (15Ambrosius W.T. Bloem L.J. Zhou L. Rebhun J.F. Snyder P.M. Wagner M.A. Guo C. Pratt J.H. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 631-637Google Scholar, 16Sugiyama T. Kato N. Ishinaga Y. Yamori Y. Yazaki Y. Hypertens. Res. 2001; 24: 515-521Google Scholar). The question of whether this polymorphism segregates with blood pressure has been addressed by several groups, and conflicting results have been reported (15Ambrosius W.T. Bloem L.J. Zhou L. Rebhun J.F. Snyder P.M. Wagner M.A. Guo C. Pratt J.H. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 631-637Google Scholar, 16Sugiyama T. Kato N. Ishinaga Y. Yamori Y. Yazaki Y. Hypertens. Res. 2001; 24: 515-521Google Scholar). We examined whether this polymorphism was associated with altered Na+ channel activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We observed that oocytes expressing wild type αT663βγ channels had significantly higher currents than oocytes expressing αT663Aβγ. Furthermore, the higher currents observed with αT663βγ channels were associated with higher levels of cell surface expression of channels, suggesting that this polymorphism altered channel trafficking. This polymorphism is present in the distal C terminus of the α-subunit, a region that is not well conserved between the human and mouse α-subunit. Although the αA692T polymorphism in mouse ENaC (mENaC), corresponding to human αT663A, was not associated with differences in functional αβγ-mENaC expression, replacement of the distal C terminus of the mouse α-subunit with the distal C terminus of the human α-subunit restored the functional differences that were observed with the human αT663A polymorphism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of hENaC Mutants—α-, β-, and γhENaC cDNAs were from M. J. Welsh (University of Iowa). Mouse ENaC cDNAs have been described and used by our group previously (17Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Google Scholar). All mutants and mouse/human chimeras were generated using a PCR-based mutagenesis technique as described previously (18Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analyses performed at sequencing facilities at the University of Pennsylvania, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, or the University of Pittsburgh.Expression of ENaC in Xenopus Oocytes—cRNAs for wild type and mutant αhENaC and αmENaC, wild type βhENaC and βmENaC, and wild type γhENaC and γmENaC were synthesized from linearized plasmids containing the appropriate cDNAs using appropriate RNA polymerases (T3, T7, or SP6, mMessage mMachine, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and stored at –80 °C. cRNA concentration was determined spectroscopically. Stage V-VI oocytes were surgically harvested from female Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) and pretreated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type IV) as described previously (18Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 2 ng/subunit of hENaC cRNAs or 0.33 ng/subunit of mENaC cRNAs in 50 nl of H2O. After injection, oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (MBS) (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, pH 7.2) supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. Animal protocols were approved by the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—A two-electrode voltage clamp (TEV) was performed 24–48 h after cRNA injection at room temperature using a DigiData 1320 interface and Axon Geneclamp 500B Amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were acquired at 200 Hz, and analyses were performed using pClamp 8.0 or 8.1 software (Axon Instruments) on 833-MHz Pentium III personal computers (Dell Computer, Austin, TX). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) with a micropipette fuller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and had resistances of 0.5–5 megohms when filled with 3 m KCl and inserted into the bath solution. Oocytes were maintained in a recording chamber with 1 ml of bath solution and continuously perfused with bath solution at a flow rate of 4–5 ml/min. The bath solution contained 100 mm sodium gluconate, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 3 mm BaCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. A series of voltage steps (1 s) from –140 to +60 mV (adjusted for resting membrane potential) in 20-mV increments were performed, and whole cell currents were recorded 750 ms after the initiation of the –100-mV voltage step for data analysis. ENaC-mediated current was defined as the difference in whole oocyte current at a –100-mV holding potential (adjusted for resting membrane potential) before and after the addition of 10 μm amiloride-HCl (Sigma) to the bath solution.Cell Surface Expression—Two approaches were used to examine the surface expression of ENaC in oocytes. A chemiluminescence-based assay was performed as described by Zerangue et al. (19Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Google Scholar) and modified by Yoo et al. (21Yoo D. Kim B.Y. Campo C. Nance L. King A. Maouyo D. Welling P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23066-23075Google Scholar, 20Carattino M.D. Hill W.G. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36202-36213Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 0.33 ng/subunit of m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663-mβγ, m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663-mβ-FLAG-mγ, or m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663A-mβ-FLAG-mγ ENaC. 42–48 h after injection oocytes were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in 4% formaldehyde in MBS. Oocytes were subsequently washed three times with MBS containing 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (MBS-BSA), incubated an additional 3 h with MBS-BSA, and then incubated overnight with MBS-BSA supplement with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) at 4 °C. Oocytes were then washed at 4 °C for 1 h in MBS-BSA and incubated with MBS-BSA supplemented with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1–1.5 h at 4 °C (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′2) fragment goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells were extensively washed (12 times over 2 h) at 4 °C and transferred to MBS without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 100 μl of SuperSignal Elisa Femto (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantitated in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA).A second approach to examine surface expression used cell surface biotinylation to identify the surface pool of channels as described previously (22Bruns J.B. Hu B. Ahn Y.J. Sheng S. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F600-F609Google Scholar). βhENaC with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (β-V5) was generated in pcDNA6 as described previously (23Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar). cRNAs for αβ-V5γ hENaC were co-injected into Xenopus oocytes. As a control, oocytes were co-injected only with cRNAs for β-V5 and γ. After 48 h, oocytes were stripped mechanically of their vitelline membranes in hypertonic medium (300 mm sucrose in MBS without penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin), and surface proteins were labeled with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) as described previously (22Bruns J.B. Hu B. Ahn Y.J. Sheng S. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F600-F609Google Scholar). Oocytes (10/group) were subsequently lysed in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.01 m EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 0.1 mm l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl-chloromethyl ketone, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Biotinylated β-subunits were detected on immunoblots probed with an anti-V5 antibody. Densitometry was performed using an AlphaImager 2200 system (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA).Statistical Analyses—Whole cell amiloride-sensitive current data were expressed relative to that of wild type ENaC. To decrease the influence of batch-to-batch variability in ENaC expression, data were normalized by the mean amiloride-sensitive current for the control condition (usually αT663βγ hENaC) within a batch of oocytes prior to combining data of multiple independent batches for statistical analysis. These data are presented as mean ± S.E. Because a Poisson distribution, rather than a Gaussian distribution, best described these combined data, p values were determined by a two-tailed t test after a square root transformation to better approximate a Gaussian distribution (24Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1984: 241-242Google Scholar). A p value of ≤0.05 was considered significant. We also independently analyzed the statistical significance of these data without normalization and transformation using the Wilcoxon rank sum/Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric results and obtained similar p values to the method outlined above (data not shown). Other data that were normally distributed are expressed as mean ± S.E. with p values determined by a two-tailed t test. All data analyses were performed with SigmaStat version 2.03.RESULTSαT663A Polymorphism Is Associated with Altered Functional Channel Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Functional hENaC expression was assessed by TEV in oocytes expressing either αT663βγ hENaC (n = 56) or the αT663A polymorphism (αT663Aβγ)(n = 57). Fig. 1 illustrates current/voltage relationships for oocytes expressing αT663βγ and αT663Aβγ hENaC before and after the addition of 10 μm amiloride. The linear current/voltage relationships are characteristic of αβγ ENaC expressed in oocytes, and the reversal potential of ∼0 mV is consistent with intracellular Na+ loading observed in oocytes expressing ENaC and incubated in MBS (17Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R. Kosari F. Harte B.J. Li J. Mackler S.A. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F121-F129Google Scholar, 18Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing αT663Aβγ channels exhibited mean ± S.E. whole cell amiloride-inhibited currents of –2.15 ± 0.29 μA at a –100-mV holding potential that were significantly lower than mean Na+ currents measured in oocytes expressing wild type channels (–4.65 ± 0.67 μA, p < 0.001 (Fig. 2 for normalized data)). Given the small difference in whole cell Na+ currents we observed with oocytes expressing αT663βγ and αT663Aβγ, experiments were performed with two different cRNA preparations and four different batches of oocytes to confirm our findings.Fig. 2The αT663A polymorphism reduces hENaC functional expression in oocytes. αT663βγ or αT663Aβγ hENaC was expressed in oocytes, and TEV was performed. Amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents were determined at a –100-mV holding potential (adjusted for resting membrane potential) and are expressed relative to the mean whole oocyte current for αT663βγhENaC-expressing oocytes. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. with the p value determined by a two-tailed t test as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Analyses of αT663 Mutants—A conservative substitution of Ser for the Thr residue at position α663 did not alter levels of amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (Fig. 3A, p = n. s.). Thr and Ser residues are potential targets of Ser/Thr kinases, and phosphorylation of this residue would alter the charge at this site. We examined whether an acidic residue (Asp) at position α663 affected functional expression of amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. Levels of amiloride-sensitive Na+ current expression in oocytes injected with either wild type (αT663βγ) hENaC or αT663Dβγ hENaC were similar (Fig. 3B, p = n. s.). In contrast, amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes expressing Na+ channels with a basic residue at position α663 (αT663Kβγ) were significantly lower than currents observed with wild type hENaC (Fig. 3C, p = 0.025). Non-polar amino acids were also introduced at position α663, and mutant or wild type channels were expressed in oocytes. Mean whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes expressing αT663Gβγ (Fig. 3D, p = 0.011) or αT663Lβγ (Fig. 3E, p < 0.001) were significantly lower than the currents measured in oocytes expressing wild type ENaC. These data are summarized in Table I.Fig. 3Effects of α663 mutants on hENaC in oocytes. αT663Sβγ (A), αT663Dβγ (B), αT663Kβγ (C), αT663Gβγ (D), and αT663Lβγ (E) were expressed in oocytes, and TEV was performed. The functional expression of these mutant hENaCs was compared with αT663βγ by determination of amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents at a –100-mV holding potential (adjusted for resting membrane potential).

T663 is present within a region of the α-subunit C terminus that is not well conserved across species. An Ala residue is present at the equivalent site in the mouse α-subunit (mαA692). We mutated mouse αA692 to Thr. Oocytes expressing mouse αA692βγ (i.e. wild type, n = 38) or mouse αA692Tβγ (n = 36) showed similar levels of amiloride-sensitive currents (Fig. 4B, p = n. s.). In contrast, oocytes expressing human αT663 with mouse βγ (n = 43) had significantly higher amiloride-sensitive currents than oocytes expressing human αT663A with mouse βγ (Fig. 4C, n = 44, p = 0.017).Fig. 4Residues in the vicinity of hαT663A have a role in conferring differences in function ENaC expression. A, alignments of the distal C termini of human and mouse α-subunits. Spaces were added to separate a conserved six-residue N-terminal tract (YATLGP) from the remainder of the C terminus and to highlight hαT663 and mαA692 (in bold). The first and last amino acid residue numbers for each sequence are listed. Sequence alignments were performed with MacVector 7.2 (Accelrys) for the mouse and human α-subunits (GenBank™ Accession Numbers AF112185 and L29007). B, TEV was performed with oocytes expressing either mouse αA692βγ or αA692Tβγ. Amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents were determined at the –100-mV holding potential (adjusted for resting membrane potential) and are expressed relative to the mean whole cell amiloride-sensitive current for αA692βγ. C, TEV was performed with oocytes expressing either human αT663/mouse βγ or human αT663A/mouse βγ. Amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents were determined at the –100-mV holding potential and expressed relative to the mean whole cell amiloride-sensitive current for human αT663/mouse βγ. D, TEV was performed with oocytes expressing either m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663/mouse βγ or m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663A/mouse βγ. Amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents were determined at the –100-mV holding potential and expressed relative to the mean whole cell amiloride-sensitive current for m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663/mouse βγ. p values were determined with a two-tailed t test as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)C-terminal sequences of human and mouse α-subunits diverge following a conserved YATLGP tract (Fig. 4A) suggesting that residues within the 20 C-terminal amino acids, in addition to Thr or Ala in position α692, may influence levels of function channel expression in association with this polymorphism. A mouse/human α-subunit chimera (m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663) was created by replacing the distal C terminus of the mouse α-subunit (SASPLDSAVPGSSACAPAMAL) with the distal C terminus of the human α-subunit (RPSPGGSAGASSSTCPLGGP). We also generated the corresponding m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663A α-subunit chimera. The co-expression of m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663A with mouse βγ led to a significant reduction in the normalized mean whole cell Na+ currents at –100 mV (–1.34 ± 0.13 μA, n = 62) when compared with m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663-mβγ (–2.04 ± 0.20 μA, n = 62, p = 0.007 (see Fig. 4D for normalized data)).αENaC Polymorphism Affects Surface Expression of ENaC— The reduced functional expression of αT663Aβγ channels in oocytes likely reflects changes in the numbers of channels at the plasma membrane or changes in channel open probability. Because these residues are not within the pore of the channel (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Google Scholar, 18Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Google Scholar), it is unlikely that this polymorphism affects single-channel conductance. Previous studies (25Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Google Scholar) have also suggested that it is difficult to assess differences in ENaC open probability because the channel has inherently large variability in open probability.We therefore examined whether differences in functional expression of αT663βγ and αT663Aβγ hENaC were associated with altered levels of cell surface expression of channels. In these experiments, the β-subunit had a C-terminal V5 epitope tag to identify the protein on immunoblots. Cell surface proteins of oocytes expressing αT663β-V5γ or αT663Aβ-V5γ were labeled by biotinylation and recovered with streptavidin beads. The biotinylated β-subunits were subsequently detected by immunoblots. As shown in Fig. 5A, expression of αT663Aβ-V5γ hENaC resulted in a relative recovery of biotinylated β-V5 of 0.64 ± 0.08 compared with that observed when αT663β-V5γ hENaC was expressed (n = 5, p = 0.003). Whole oocyte β-V5 expression was similar in the two groups (Fig 5B). These data suggest that the increases in functional expression observed with αT663βγ, when compared with αT663Aβγ, are because of differences in surface expression.Fig. 5The hαT663A polymorphism affects channel surface expression. Human αT663βγ or αT663Aβγ was expressed in oocytes where the β-subunit had a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (β-V5). Non-injected oocytes were used as controls. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and β-V5 hENaC recovered by streptavidin-agarose precipitation was quantitated by immunoblot and densitometry. A, representative immunoblot and densitometry of immunoblots probed with an anti-V5 antibody. Densitometry results are expressed as mean ± S.E., n = 5 independent experiments, and normalized to values obtained with oocytes expressing αT663β-V5γ. B, representative immunoblot of whole oocyte lysates of αT663 and αT663A-injected oocytes demonstrating a similar expression of β-V5 hENaC.

Investig. 1999; 104: 967-974Google Scholar) suggested that the α-subunit has a key role in facilitating the trafficking of β- and γ-subunits to the plasma membrane in oocytes. In the absence of α-subunit expression, levels of surface expression of β- and γ-subunits in oocytes are reduced markedly (25Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C.

Investig. 1999; 104: 967-974Google Scholar). We observed that the recovery of biotinylated β-V5 in oocytes expressing only βγ-hENaC was 0.18 ± 0.06 (n = 3) of that observed with oocytes expressing αT663βγ hENaC (data not shown). These data suggest that oocytes that are stripped of their vitelline membrane have only a limited labeling of intracellular β-subunits with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin.We also examined whether differences in the functional expression of mouse/human α-chimeras (m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663-mβγ and m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663A-mβγ) were associated with altered levels of cell surface expression of channels. Cell surface expression was determined using a β-subunit with an extracellular FLAG epitope tag and a chemiluminescence-based assay that does not require stripping of the oocyte vitelline membrane. The mean relative cell surface expression of m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663A-mβγ was 0.59 ± 0.10 (n = 46) compared with that of m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663-mβγ (Fig. 6, 1.00 ± 0.18, n = 47, p = 0.016). Nonspecific labeling was examined in oocytes expressing m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663-mβγ where the β-subunit did not contain an epitope tag. Mean nonspecific labeling was 0.18 ± 0.03 (n = 35) of the labeling observed in oocytes expressing epitope-tagged m(1–678)/h(650–669)T663-mβγ. We also performed separate control experiments to assess the labeling of intra-cellular β-subunits in this chemiluminescence-based assay. The labeling of oocytes expressing only human β-FLAG, which, as discussed above, has markedly reduced surface expression (25Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C.

https://openalex.org/W2156476693,"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-mediated cholesterol efflux involves the binding of apoA-I to the plasma membrane via its C terminus and requires cellular ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) activity. ApoA-I also stimulates secretion of apolipoprotein E (apoE) from macrophage foam cells, although the mechanism of this process is not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that apoA-I stimulates secretion of apoE independently of both ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and of lipid binding by its C terminus. Pulse-chase experiments using 35S-labeled cellular apoE demonstrate that macrophage apoE exists in both relatively mobile (Em) and stable (Es) pools, that apoA-I diverts apoE from degradation to secretion, and that only a small proportion of apoA-I-mobilized apoE is derived from the cell surface. The structural requirements for induction of apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux are clearly dissociated, as C-terminal deletions in recombinant apoA-I reduce cholesterol efflux but increase apoE secretion, and deletion of central helices 5 and 6 decreases apoE secretion without perturbing cholesterol efflux. Moreover, a range of 11- and 22-mer α-helical peptides representing amphipathic α-helical segments of apoA-I stimulate apoE secretion whereas only the C-terminal α-helix (domains 220–241) stimulates cholesterol efflux. Other α-helix-containing apolipoproteins (apoA-II, apoA-IV, apoE2, apoE3, apoE4) also stimulate apoE secretion, implying a positive feedback autocrine loop for apoE secretion, although apoE4 is less effective. Finally, apoA-I stimulates apoE secretion normally from macrophages of two unrelated subjects with genetically confirmed Tangier Disease (mutations C733R and c.5220–5222delTCT; and mutations A1046D and c.4629–4630insA), despite severely inhibited cholesterol efflux. We conclude that apoA-I stimulates secretion of apoE independently of cholesterol efflux, and that this represents a novel, ABCA-1-independent, positive feedback pathway for stimulation of potentially anti-atherogenic apoE secretion by α-helix-containing molecules including apoA-I and apoE.

Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein component of HDL, is understood to play an important role in this process (1Asztalos B.F. Roheim P.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Properties additional to induction of cholesterol efflux may contribute to the anti-atherogenic effect of apoA-1.

This may depend upon enhanced local clearance of cellular lipids and/or inhibition of local inflammatory responses, in addition to lowering plasma concentrations of atherogenic plasma lipoproteins. Recent studies demonstrated that apoA-I stimulates both apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux from human and mouse foam cell macrophages (12Bielicki J.K. McCall M.R. Forte T.M. J.

Recent studies indicate that ABCA1 may be involved in basal apoE secretion (16Von Eckardstein A. Langer C. Engel T. Schaukal I. Cignarella A. Reinhardt J. Lorkowski S. Li Z. Zhou X. Cullen P. Assmann G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for ABCA1 activity in apoA-I-induced apoE secretion has never been reported. In this study we provide evidence that apoA-I-stimulated apoE secretion is mechanistically distinct from its stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. We demonstrate that apoA-I promotes secretion of a mobile pool of apoE, which is otherwise destined for intracellular degradation, that this process does not require interactions between the C terminus of apoA-I and the plasma membrane and occurs normally in macrophages of patients with Tangier disease, implying independence from ABCA1 activity.

Wild-type apoA-I and engineered variants of apoA-I were expressed in expression host E. coli strain Bl21-DE3 and isolated by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography (29Saito H.

Identical stimulation of apoE secretion from human macrophage foam cells was observed in control experiments using recombinant wild-type apoA-I and human apoA-I prepared from human plasma. In previous studies we established that 5–10 μg/ml apoA-I was saturating for cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion from human and murine macrophages (13Rees D. Sloane T. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27925-27933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present studies, peptides and proteins were added to cells at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml culture medium after first establishing that this was in excess of saturating concentrations for induction of apoE secretion for all molecules. Preparation of Phospholipid ApoA-I and Phospholipid ApoA-II Discs—Discs were prepared as described previously (19Rye K.A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the cholate dialysis method (30Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After preparation, all discs were dialyzed extensively against 0.01 m Tris-buffered saline containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) EDTA-Na2, 0,006% (w/v) NaN3, and stored under argon. Lipid-free apoA-I and apoA-II were not present in the preparations as judged by electrophoresis on non-denaturing 3–40% gradient gels. Phospholipid composition was varied by altering the proportions of phospholipids added at the time of preparation. All chemical analyses of reconstituted particles were carried out on a Roche/Hitachi 902 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Zurich, Switzerland). Phospholipid concentrations were determined enzymatically (31Trinder P. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1969; 6: 24-27Crossref Google Scholar, 32Takayama M. Itoh S. Nagasaki T. Tanimizu I. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1977; 79: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The Stokes' diameter and surface charge of the particles was measured by non-denaturing PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis (19Rye K.A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liang H.Q. Rye K.A. Barter P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1187-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, after cell efflux incubations, media containing apoA-I phospholipid or apoA-II phospholipid discs underwent non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electrophoretic transfer nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotting for apoE, apoA-I, or apoA-II to investigate possible association of apoE with phospholipid-containing particles. Isolation and Culture of Human Monocyte-derived Macrophages (HMDM)—Human monocytes (apoE3/E3 phenotype) were isolated from white cell concentrates from healthy donors using centrifugal elutriation as described (13Rees D. Sloane T. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27925-27933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Genotyping was completed by Taq polymerase chain reaction amplification of a 232-base pair fragment of the apoE gene followed by cutting with the restriction endonuclease Cfo1 by the Department of Biochemistry, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. White cell buffy coat concentrates (<24 h, ex vivo) and human serum were provided by the New South Wales Red Cross blood transfusion service, Sydney, Australia. Purified monocytes (>95% purity by nonspecific esterase staining) were differentiated by plating at 1.5 × 106 cells per 22-mm diameter culture dish (Costar) in RPMI 1640 containing penicillin G and streptomycin (50 units/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated whole human serum for 6 days. Following differentiation, the cells were washed and enriched with unesterified cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl ester (CE) by incubation in RPMI 1640 containing 10% LPDS (v/v) and AcLDL (50 μg protein/ml) for 4 days (13Rees D.

Mononuclear cells from individual donors (Tangier disease subjects and their controls) were isolated by minor modification of a previously described density separation method (34Boyum A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 108: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35Becq F. Hamon Y. Bajetto A. Gola M. Verrier B. Chimini G. J. Biol.

Total cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/22-mm diameter culture well (Falcon). Cells were differentiated to macrophages in RPMI 1640-containing antibiotics, glutamine, 50 ng/ml M-CSF (36Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G.

Atherosclerosis. 1997; 128: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for 6 days. At this time cells were washed prior to cholesterol enrichment (see above). Direct comparisons between HMDM isolated from normal donors by density centrifugation and centrifugal elutriation confirmed identical cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion by either method. Lipid Efflux and ApoE Secretion—To achieve cholesterol loading of macrophages, 2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in ethanol was incorporated into AcLDL before incubating with cells for 4 days as described (18Kritharides L. Christian A. Stoudt G. Morel D. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Triplicate cultures were harvested after loading to confirm efficient enrichment with FC and CE by HPLC. Cells were subsequently washed, equilibrated overnight in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, to allow equilibration of [3H]cholesterol in FC and CE pools. In some experiments, cells were loaded with AcLDL without [3H]cholesterol, and phospholipids were labeled at the end of the 4-day cholesterol-loading period by incubating cells with RPMI 1640 containing 3 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride in ethanol (final 2% (v/v)) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) for 22 h, followed by equilibration for 1 h in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Equilibrated, cholesterol-enriched cells were washed with warm PBS and incubated in 1.0 ml of efflux medium comprising RPMI 1640 with or without 25 μg/ml apoA-I or the appropriate additions. After 1–8 h, media were removed, mixed with Complete© protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and 0.02 TIU of aprotinin (Sigma) and spun for 2 min at 16,000 × g to remove any detached cells. The cultures were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then scraped in 0.8 ml of cold PBS containing Complete© protease inhibitor and aprotinin. Quantitation of Cholesterol and Cholesteryl Ester in Cells and Media—40-μl media aliquots and 5-μl cell aliquots were analyzed by scintillation counting to quantify efflux of [3H]cholesterol. The proportions of label in cell [3H]FC and [3H]CE were determined after separation by TLC in heptane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v). Standards of FC and CE were identified by charring at 100 °C in 10% CuSO4, 8.5%H3PO4. The masses of FC and CE in cells and media were determined by reverse-phase HPLC after extraction into methanol/hexane (17Kritharides L. Jessup W. Mander E.L. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 38Kritharides L. Jessup W. Gifford J. Dean R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Radiochemical equilibrium was determined by calculating the specific activity of free and esterified cholesterol (dpm per nmol) (18Kritharides L. Christian A. Stoudt G. Morel D. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and was reproducibly achieved after 4 days of cholesterol enrichment and overnight equilibration. Quantitation of Phospholipids in Cells and Media—Phospholipids were extracted from 150-μl aliquots of cell lysates and media samples using the method of Bligh and Dyer including two backwashes with methanol/water (10:9, v/v) as described previously (39Gelissen I.C. Rye K.A. Brown A.J. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1636-1646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After evaporation of the chloroform phase, lipids were dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and 50-μl aliquots were counted by scintillation counting to determine phospholipid efflux. Total phospholipid mass was determined using a modification of the Bartlett assay as described (40Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and was used to determine specific activity (dpm per nmol phospholipid). Quantitation of ApoE in Cell Lysates and Efflux Media by Western Blot and by ELISA—Aliquots (55 μl) of cell culture medium were mixed with sample buffer (27.5 μl) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE using a 4% stacking gel, and 12.5% polyacrylamide resolving gel under reducing conditions in Tris-glycine buffer as described (13Rees D. Sloane T. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27925-27933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Western blot transfer onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes was performed in Trisglycine buffer for 1 h at 25–30 V, blocked before incubating with primary antibody to apoE (goat anti-human polyclonal, 1:5000 dilution), and washing and incubating with 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody (rabbit anti-goat IgG) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (13Rees D. Sloane T. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27925-27933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Membrane chemiluminescence signal was quantified using Kodak Digital Science 1D and expressed as arbitrary units (AU) per mg of cell protein. In most experiments, a serial dilution of authentic human apoE standard in sample buffer was separated and blotted in parallel to allow calculation of secreted apoE mass as microgram per culture or μg per mg of cell protein. The linear response range of chemiluminescence signal to mass of authentic human apoE standard was defined for each Western blot in each experiment. In addition, apoE secretion was measured in some experiments using ELISA. NUNC 96 well immunoplates were coated with 1.5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-human apoE antibody (Biodesign) in 0.2 m Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer. Standards were prepared from purified human apoE (Biodesign), whereas antibodies used in Western analysis were used as tagging antibodies (goat anti-human polyclonal, 1:3750 and rabbit antigoat horseradish peroxidase, 1:2500). Metabolic Labeling of Cell Proteins with [35S]Methionine/Cysteine— To study the fate of newly synthesized apoE, cholesterol-enriched HMDM were labeled in methionine-free medium (Invitrogen) containing 250 μCi/ml [35S]TRAN-label (1175 Ci/mmol, ICN) for 3 h, then washed and chased in RPMI 1640 media containing 2 mm methionine (Sigma) and cysteine (Sigma). 35S-labeled apoE in cell lysates and culture medium were determined by immunoprecipitation using 1:10,000 dilution of the polyclonal goat antibody to human apoE and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) after separation by SDS-PAGE, quantified by phosphorimaging (Photostimulated Luminescence, Fujix BAS 1000) and expressed as AU of apoE/mg of cell protein (13Rees D. Sloane T. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27925-27933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Where indicated, in experiments detecting small amounts of secreted apoE requiring increased sensitivity, immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled apoE was directly quantified by radiometric detection, after confirming a single band on SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. [35S]Methionine/cysteine labeling was also used to discriminate between cell derived (secreted) and exogenous apoE in experiments investigating the secretion of apoE by recombinant apoE2, E3, and E4. Biotinylation and Isolation of Biotinylated ApoE—Cholesterol-enriched HMDM were incubated with 200 μCi/ml [35S]TRAN-label in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% DMEM for 16 h. Surface proteins were then biotinylated by placing the cells on ice for 5 min, followed by incubation with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS at 4 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and subsequently incubated with or without 25 μg/ml apoA-I for 30 min at 37 °C. ApoE was immunoprecipitated as described above, and biotinylated apoE separated from total immunoprecipitated apoE as described (41Zhao Y. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In short, total apoE was released from protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling in 100 μl of HEPES-buffered saline containing 1% SDS at 90 °C for 3 min. Biotinylated apoE was separated from unbiotinylated apoE using ImmunoPure Immobilized Streptavidin (Pierce) and both were quantified using scintillation counting and SDS-PAGE/phosphorimaging. Biotinylated apoE was"

BRCC2 open reading frame (327 bp) codes for an ∼12-kDa protein (108 amino acids (aa)) localized predominantly in the cytosol and to a lesser extent in the mitochondria. Ectopic expression of BRCC2 cDNA also was found in both the cytosol and mitochondria. Exogenous expression of BRCC2 caused apoptotic cell death in three different cell lines as evidenced by enhanced chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, or an enhanced number of cells in the sub-G1 phase. In human prostate cancer cells (PC-3), BRCC2-induced DNA fragmentation was blocked efficiently by coexpression of the anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl-XL. Transient transfection of BRCC2 cDNA into PC-3 cells in the presence of a broad-range caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (100 μM, 24 h), abrogated DNA fragmentation. Consistently, BRCC2 expression correlated with the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. An N-terminal deletion mutant of BRCC2 (10.2 kDa, Δ1-16 aa) lacking a BH3-like domain (5-12 aa, LPIEGQEI) or BRCC2 containing a mutant BH3-like domain (leucine 5→glutamate) failed to induce apoptosis, whereas a C-terminal deletion mutant (6.8 kDa, Δ62-108 aa) retained the apoptotic activity comparable to the full-length BRCC2. Finally, the treatment of HeLa cells with doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) led to an increase in the mitochondrial (heavy membrane) level of endogenous BRCC2 (doxorubicin (100 ng/ml), 5 h, ∼2-fold; H2O2 (200 μM), 2 h, ∼2-fold). These findings demonstrate that BRCC2 functions as a proapoptotic molecule and suggest that BRCC2 induces a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway of cell death.

These findings demonstrate that BRCC2 functions as a proapoptotic molecule and suggest that BRCC2 induces a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway of cell death. Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a physiological process that is essential in development and tissue homeostasis, and deregulation of apoptosis has been associated with cancer and degenerative diseases (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6187) Google Scholar). Two signal transduction pathways of apoptosis have been studied extensively (2Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). The “extrinsic pathway” is induced by the binding of a “death ligand” (tumor necrosis factor or FasL) to its receptor on the plasma membrane (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 or Fas) and activation of a cysteine protease, caspase-8. In response to a variety of cytotoxic/stress-related signals, apoptosis is triggered through an “intrinsic pathway” involving the Bcl-2 family of proteins, the release of apoptogenic molecules from the mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of caspase-9 (3Gross A. McDonnell M. Kormsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 and caspase-9 activate the “effector caspases” such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 that cleave and inactivate a number of substrates including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNA nuclease, lamins, and others, ultimately leading to chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and cell death (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6151) Google Scholar). Although the effector caspases are critical components of the apoptotic pathways, caspase-independent apoptosis also has been demonstrated. For example, apoptosis inducing factor and endonuclease G may be released from the damaged mitochondria, and these can directly act in the nucleus, inducing chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (5Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a pivotal role in the control of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and consists of both anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic members (7Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 8Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w share homology within three or four Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; BRCC2, breast cancer cell 2; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; LS-HB, low salt homogenization buffer; HA, hemagglutinin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; L5E, leucine 5→glutamate; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin.1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; BRCC2, breast cancer cell 2; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; LS-HB, low salt homogenization buffer; HA, hemagglutinin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; L5E, leucine 5→glutamate; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. domains (BH1-4). The proapoptotic members contain either two or three BH domains (multi-BH domain proapoptotic proteins: Bax, Bak, Bcl-GL, and Bcl-XS) or only the short (9-16 amino acids) BH3 domain (BH3-only proteins: Bid, PUMA, Bim, Noxa, Bad, Bmf, and so on) (9Bouillet P. Strasser A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a new class of proapoptotic molecules has emerged that contains a BH3-like domain with completely conserved leucine but not aspartate in the BH3 domain (BH3-like-only protein, modulator of apoptosis-1) (10Tan K.O. Tan K.M.L. Chan S.-L. Yee K.S.Y. Bevort M. Ang K.C. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2802-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The BH3-only proteins are believed to act as early damage sensors that bind to other Bcl-2-like molecules. Aggregation of Bax or Bak molecules in the mitochondria is an equally obligatory step in the initiation of apoptosis. The signals upstream of the BH3-only proteins remain elusive. Because apoptosis also appears to occur in the absence of a known key initiator(s) of the intrinsic pathway, an unidentified adapter molecule has been proposed to interact with the aggregated Bax/Bak and activate an initiator caspase (9Bouillet P. Strasser A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cross-talk among the different apoptotic pathways and redundancy of the apoptogenic signals challenge many of the existing paradigms of this relatively complex cascade of events. BRCC2 (breast cancer cell 2) gene was originally identified as an ∼1.2-kb transcript in MDA-MB 231 human breast carcinoma cells, other human cancer cell lines, and in normal tissues (GenBank™ accession numbers AF220061 and AF303179) (11Gokhale P.C.

Gokhale et al., manuscript in preparation.BRCC2 is an intronless gene localized on human chromosome 11q24.1. The loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 11q24.1-11q25 has been associated with early onset breast cancer and poor prognosis of breast and ovarian neoplasias (12Gentile M. Olsen K. Dufmats M.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 950-954PubMed Google Scholar). The goals of this study were to determine the subcellular localization and function of BRCC2. We provide the first evidence that BRCC2 is a cytosolic and mitochondrial protein, and it has a negative impact on cell survival. BRCC2 expression correlates with caspase activation, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, hallmarks of cells undergoing apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of BRCC2 including a BH3-like domain (amino acids at positions 5-12) is important for BRCC2-induced apoptosis. In addition, the translocation of endogenous BRCC2 to the mitochondria (heavy membrane) is increased in response to doxorubicin and hydrogen peroxide, which are known to be cytotoxic agents. All of the cell lines used in this study were obtained from the Tissue Culture Shared Resource of the Lombardi Cancer Center and grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 and 95% air in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen), and 100 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Biofluids). Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbit polyclonal anti-serum was generated by Zymed Laboratories Inc. against a BRCC2-specific custom peptide, KARLPLEALLGSNKEPMLPK(C) (amino acids 42-61; the last cysteine was added for conjugation purposes).

For PCR, the forward primer was 5′-GCCGCCATGGAGCAGAAACTCATCTCTGAAGAGGATCTGATCCTAGAATCTGAGTGT-3′ (a Kozak sequence and initiation codon at the 5′-end are followed by Myc epitope (underlined)), and the reverse primer was 5′-GCCTCATTACAGGGCCTCAGCAGAGGAATTGCATAA-3′. Myc-BRCC2(ΔC-47)—A deletion mutant of Myc-tagged BRCC2 lacking the last 47 amino acids was generated by PCR (216 bp) and cloning using pCR3.1-Myc-BRCC2(Ile) as template and PCR conditions as described for Myc-BRCC2(Ile) followed by sequence verification. The forward primer was as described for Myc-BRCC2(Val), and the reverse primer was 5′-CTATTACTTAGGCAACATAGGTTCTTTGT-3′ (two- stop codons incorporated are underlined). Myc-BRCC2(L5E)—Myc-tagged BRCC2 containing mutated BH3-like domain was generated by the substitution of leucine at position 5 with glutamate. This change was incorporated in the design of the 5′-primer sequence replacing natural leucine codon (TTG) with a glutamate codon (GAG). First, N-terminal Myc-tagged BRCC2(Ile) ORF was cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced as described for Myc-BRCC2(Ile). Subsequently, N-terminal Myc-tagged BRCC2 ORF containing a single amino acid change (leucine 5→glutamate) was amplified using pCR2.1Myc-tagged BRCC2(Ile) as a template followed by cloning into pCR3.1 and sequence verification. The forward primer was 5′-GCCGCCATGGAGCAGAAACTCATCTCTGAAGAGGATCTGATGGTGACTTTGGAGCCTA-3′ (Myc epitope (underlined) is flanked by Kozak sequence and initiation codon at the 5′-end; codon substitution is shown in boldface). The reverse primer was as described for Myc-BRCC2(Val). HA-p53 and HA-Bcl-XL—HA-tagged cDNAs representing ORFs of p53 (1179 bp, GenBank™ accession number X60013) and Bcl-XL (699 bp, GenBank™ accession number Z23115) and the ORF of Bax (576 bp, GenBank™ accession number L22473) were generated by PCR using human placenta Marathon cDNA as template (Clontech). The following pairs of primers were used (HA tag is underlined and is flanked by Kozak sequence and initiation codon at the 5′-end): p53, 5′-GCCATGGCTTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTATGGAGGAGCCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCATTAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTCTGTCTTGAACATGAGTTTTTTATGGC-3′ (reverse); and Bcl-XL, 5′-GCCATGGCTTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTATGTCTCAGAGCAACCGGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGAGCCCAGCAGAACCACGCCGGCCACAGTCATG-3′(reverse). All of the amplified cDNAs were cloned into the pCR3.1 vector and verified by sequencing of both strands. Baxα—The following pairs of primers were used: 5′-GCCATGGCTTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGACGGGTCCGGGGAGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGCCCATCTTCTTCCAGATGGTGAGCGAGGCGGTGAGCACTCCCGCCACAAAGA-3′ (reverse). The Bax construct was found to code for p18 Bax (amino acids 20-192). For β-galactosidase assay, COS-1 cells were seeded on coverslips and, a day later, transfected with 2 μg of Myc-BRCC2 or empty vector along with 0.2 μg of pcDNA3.1/LacZ (Invitrogen). In certain cases, 0.5 μg of BRCC2 construct (Myc-BRCC2(L5E)) or empty vector along with 0.05 μg of pcDNA3.1/lacZ was used for transfection. Twenty-four hours later, adherent cells were collected, fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and stained using an X-gal staining kit (Invitrogen). The morphology of transfected cells (blue) was visualized with an Olympus AH2 Vanox microscope (×25 objective). DNA fragmentation assay was carried out as follows. Cells were (∼2 × 106) transfected transiently with various cDNA constructs (5-10 μg). At various times posttransfection (0-36 h), adherent and floating cells were collected and lysed in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% SDS and incubated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K overnight at 37 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted sequentially with 1 ml of phenol, 1 ml of phenol: chloroform, and 1 ml of chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.3 m potassium acetate. DNA pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in nuclease-free water containing 100 μg/ml RNase A (Ambion). The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and 20-25 μg of DNA were loaded onto a 2% agarose gel followed by electrophoresis at 50 V for 2 h in 1× TAE buffer (Eppendorf) and ethidium bromide staining. The percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase was determined by FACS analysis using FACSort (BD Biosciences). Cells were transfected transiently for various times, and then both floating and adherent cells were collected and fixed in absolute ethanol for FACS analysis. Approximately 5 × 106 cells were seeded/150-mm dish. On the next day, cells were collected by trypsinization and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Low salt homogenization buffer (LS-HB) containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was added (300 μl of LS-HB/dish for 10 min on ice). An equal volume of 0.6 m sucrose in LS-HB was added, and the cells were homogenized either by 40 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer equipped with a tight-fitting pestle B or by passing 25-30 times through a 26-G needle. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 700 × g for 10 min. The pellet represented the initial nuclear fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10-20 min, resulting in the supernatant and the mitochondria-enriched or heavy membrane (HM) fractions (pellet). The supernatant was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h to collect the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). The mitochondria-enriched fraction was resuspended twice in isotonic homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose in LS-HB) and centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g for 15 min each time. Mitochondria either were resuspended in isotonic buffer or extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (14Broustas C.G. Grammatikakis N. Eto M. Dent P. Brautigan D.L. Kasid U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3053-3059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min to remove residual pellet. The initial nuclear fraction was washed twice in LS-HB, and the proteins were extracted by resuspending the pellet in high salt homogenization buffer (i.e. LS-HB containing 750 mm KCl, 200 μl/dish), incubation with mild agitation at 4 °C for 20 min, and centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant representing the nuclear fraction was diluted with an equal volume of LS-HB. The cytosolic, mitochondrial (heavy membrane), and nuclear fractions were stored at -80 °C until use. HeLa cells (6 × 106) were seeded in 150-mm tissue culture dishes, and ∼20 h later, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml doxorubicin (Sigma) prepared as a 2 mg/ml stock in Me2SO or vehicle (Me2SO) in serum-containing medium. Cells were incubated for 5 or 16 h and subsequently harvested by trypsinization and fractionated into cytosolic (C) and mitochondria-enriched fractions (HM) as described above. HeLa cells grown as above in serum-containing medium were treated with hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, 30% w/w) at a final concentration of 200 μm for 2 h, and subcellular fractions were isolated as described above. Immunoblotting was performed essentially as described previously (14Broustas C.G. Grammatikakis N. Eto M. Dent P. Brautigan D.L. Kasid U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3053-3059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At various times posttransfection, adherent and floating cells were collected. Whole cell extracts (total cell homogenates) were prepared by cell lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (14Broustas C.G. Grammatikakis N. Eto M. Dent P. Brautigan D.L. Kasid U. J. Biol.

Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45 μm) immunoblotted with the appropriate primary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The antigen-antibody complex was determined using the ECL detection assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The signals were scanned and quantified using the NIH ImageJ 1.31 software program (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Caspase-3 activity assay was carried out using the fluorometric assay (ApoAlert caspase assay kit, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both adherent and floating cells were collected and lysed. Fluorescence was measured with a TECAN Ultra 384 fluorometer. COS-1 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 1 μg of Myc-BRCC2 or empty vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. The cells were stained with anti-Myc antibody (1:250 dilution, overnight at 4 °C) followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline and incubation with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) (1:1,000 dilution, 45 min). During the last 10 min of the incubation, 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added to stain the nuclei.

https://openalex.org/W2070553019,"Many strains of Vibrio cholerae produce a cytolysin (VCC) that forms oligomeric transmembrane pores in animal cells. The molecule is secreted as a procytolysin (pro-VCC) of 79 kDa that must be cleaved at the N terminus to generate the active 65-kDa toxin. Processing can occur in solution, and previous studies have described the action of mature VCC thus generated. However, little is known about the properties of pro-VCC itself. In this study, it is shown that pro-VCC exist as a monomer in solution and binds as a monomer to eukaryotic cells. Bound pro-VCC can then be activated either by exogenous, extracellular, or by endogenous, cell-bound proteases. In both cases, cleavage generates the 65-kDa VCC that oligomerizes to form transmembrane pores. A wide variety of exogenous proteinases can mediate activation. In contrast, the activating cellular protease is selectively inhibited by the hydroxamate inhibitor TAPI, and thus probable candidates are members of the ADAM-metalloproteinase family. Furin, MMP-2, MMP-9, and serine proteinases were excluded. Cells over-expressing ADAM-17, also known as tumor necrosis factor α converting enzyme, displayed increased activation of VCC, and knockout cells lacking ADAM-17 had a markedly decreased capacity to cleave the protoxin. The possibility is raised that pro-VCC is targeted to membrane sites that selectively contain or are accessible to cellular ADAM-metalloproteinases. Although many microbial toxins are activated by furin, this is the first evidence for processing by a cellular metalloproteinase. We identified ADAM-17 as a potent activator of pro-VCC.

VCC thus contributes to the pathogenesis of gastroenteritis caused by V. cholerae strains, especially with strains not producing cholera toxin (4Pichel M. Rivas M. Chinen I. Martin F. Ibarra C. Binsztein N. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Such strains also occasionally cause septicemia (5Ninin E. Caroff N. El Kouri D. Espaze E. Richet H.

Genetic characterization of VCC identified the structural gene hlyA encoding a protein which results, after removal of a signal peptide during secretion, in a protoxin (pro-VCC) of 79 kDa (7Alm R.A.

This is the sole form present in supernatants after 8 h of bacterial culture. With time, the protein can undergo N-terminal proteolytic cleavage, and mature 65-kDa VCC is detectable in aged (48 h) culture supernatants (9Yamamoto K. Ichinose Y. Shinagawa H. Makino K. Nakata A. Iwanaga M. Honda T. Miwatani T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4106-4116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Artificial activation of pro-VCC can be achieved in solution by a wide variety of proteinases; cleavage then occurs at one of multiple sites between Leu-146 and Asn-158, depending upon the processing agent. In all cases, functionally active 65-kDa toxin is obtained (10Nagamune K. Yamamoto K. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4655-4658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that the 65-kDa mature VCC binds to lipid membranes in a nonspecific, reversible fashion (11Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T.C. Biermann C. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J.

Although mature VCC is irreversibly denatured by urea, pro-VCC refolds correctly after the removal of urea, and active VCC is obtained upon trypsinization.

It was also reported that pro-VCC was weakly hemolytic, a finding that was interpreted to indicate that the N-terminal pro-peptide interferes with pore formation (19Nagamune K. Yamamoto K. Honda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1338-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As will be detailed in this communication, our data led us to another conclusion. A theoretical analysis has led to the recognition that VCC shares structural and, probably, functional characteristics with pore-forming toxins of Staphylococcus aureus (α-toxin and leukocidin) and with aerolysin (20Olson R. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). VCC is most closely related to staphylococcal cytolysins, and all have a common cytolytic core with a similar overall fold and a similar putative membrane spanning region. In addition, VCC contains a lectin domain that is absent in the other cytolysins. The properties of pro-VCC have not been described in any detail. Processing may occur in solution, as is also known for aerolysin (21Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 1632: 336-340Crossref Google Scholar). However, protoxin is the secreted form in both cases, and it is not ad hoc evident that fluid-phase processing should occur in a biological setting. Enteric pathogens generally adhere to target cells, and this intimate contact may shield secreted toxins from the action of soluble host proteases. In septicemia or tissue infections, there would be yet less reason to assume that pro-VCC should mainly be processed prior to contact with target cells. It has remained unclear whether pro-VCC itself may bind to cells and be activated thereafter, as has been shown for pro-aerolysin. In the latter case, processing occurs through the action of cell-bound furin (22Abrami L. Fivaz M. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Jean F. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Buckley J.T. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32656-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the endogenous proteinase that seems to assume a central role in activating many other microbial toxin precursors, including anthrax protective antigen (23Klimpel K.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26461-26465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report that pro-VCC binds as a monomer to target cells and can subsequently be activated by both exogenous and endogenous proteases. A proteinase of the ADAM family, rather than furin, was identified as the active principle in the latter case. Processing is followed by oligomerization and transmembrane pore formation. Cloning, Recombinant Expression, and Purification of Protoxin—For expression of the pro-VCC, the hlyA gene was amplified from V. cholerae El Tor-O1 strain 8731 by PCR and cloned into the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) which adds a His6 tag to the N terminus of procytolysin. Upon transformation of Escherichia coli M15 with the construct and with plasmid pREP4 to provide an enhanced amount of lac repressor, cells were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin to an A600 of 0.8, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration) for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) and disrupted by ultrasonication with a Branson probe sonifier 250 (3 × 1 min, output scale = 30). Inclusion bodies were recovered from the suspension by centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g) and washed repeatedly with washing buffer (10 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). The pellet was finally dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The denatured His6-tagged fusion protein was purified on Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with nickel chloride. The column was washed 3× with 50 mm 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid in 500 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, pH 6.3, and then eluted with the same buffer adjusted to pH 5.5. For renaturation, the protein (dissolved at 1 mg/ml in buffer containing 8 m urea) was diluted 50× in 20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-methyl-cyclodextrin, pH 6.8. Samples were processed over a hydroxyl apatite column from which the protein was eluted with 70 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. When applicable, proteolytic activation was accomplished by incubation with trypsin (1 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 20 min. Mature non-recombinant VCC was isolated according to published procedures (11Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T.C. Biermann C. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Native PAGE and Ferguson Plot Analysis—For native PAGE, a continuous buffer system (50 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine, pH 9.2) was used. Polyacrylamide gels were cast with final concentrations of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9% polyacrylamide, respectively, and loaded with cytolysin, procytolysin, and a commercial set of appropriate marker proteins (Sigma). For each protein, a primary plot was constructed of the relative electrophoretic mobility versus the polyacrylamide concentration. In a Ferguson plot, the slopes of the primary plots were related to the molecular masses of the protein species (29Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Hemolytic Assays—Serial dilutions of procytolysin (tryptically activated when indicated) were prepared in duplicate with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Rabbit erythrocytes were added to each dilution step to a final concentration of 1.25% (w/v) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Hemolysis was measured at A412 nm. When indicated, hemolytic assays were performed in the presence of 30 mm polyethylene glycol (1000 or 1500 Da) as an osmotic protectant. Measurement of Intracellular ATP—Int407 cells in 96-well plates were treated with various concentrations of pro-VCC or VCC for 120 min, after which the supernatants were removed. Cellular ATP concentrations were determined after lysing the cells with 0.2 ml of 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 as described, using a commercial ATP-bioluminescence kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Intracellular ATP was expressed as the percentage of luminescence relative to that of negative controls (without toxin). Analysis of Cell-bound Toxin—Int407 cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Erythrocyte ghosts were produced as described previously (11Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T.C. Biermann C. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes (4 × 108 cells/ml) or ghosts were incubated with pro-VCC (5 μg/ml) for the indicated time at 37 °C or 4 °C in HBSS, washed twice, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (11Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T.C. Biermann C. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Int407 or Chinese hamster ovary cells were scraped off and resuspended in HBSS, followed by pre-incubation with protease inhibitors for 5 min at 37 °C when indicated. Cells were then incubated with toxin in HBSS for 60 min at 37 °C, pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 5000 × g), and washed with HBSS. Cells were finally solubilized with 1% SDS and electrophoresed. Western blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against mature V. cholerae cytolysin (2Zitzer A.O. Nakisbekov N.O. Li A.V. Semiotrochev V.L.Y. Kiseliov Y. Muratkhodjaev J.N.

Protease inhibitors used were N-ethylmaleimide (1 mm), aprotinin (100 μm), pepstatin (20 μm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) (all from Sigma), Pefabloc™ (3 mm), and protease inhibitors mixture Complete (Roche), furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (50 μm) (30Garten W.

Trypsin, dispase (protease from Bacillus polymyxa), proteinase K, and proteinase type XVIII (from Rhizopus sp.) were obtained from Sigma. Cross-linking Experiments—Pro-VCC or VCC was incubated with either 0.2–10 mm dimethylsuberimidate in 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5, with 0.06–5.0 mm difluorodinitrobenzene in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, or with 100 μm disuccinimidyl-suberate (DSS) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to 100 mm, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analogous cross-linking experiments were performed on cell-bound toxin. 100 μm DSS (final concentration) was added for 15 min to cells carrying bound pro-VCC. Crosslinking was terminated by adding 100 mm (final concentration) Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubation was done at 37 °C for 5 min. Cell pellets were further washed with 5 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, prior to electrophoresis. Genetically Engineered Cell Lines—Wild-type EC-4 and ADAM-17ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 murine fibroblasts in which ADAM-17 (tumor necrosis factor α converting enzyme) was inactivated (33Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Roy Black. We produced HEK-293 cells that over-express ADAM-17 as follows. First, a hemagglutinin epitope (encoding YPYD-VDDYA) was added to the ADAM-17 gene. The stop codon within the murine ADAM-17 cDNA was deleted by PCR-directed mutagenesis and replaced by an Nrul restriction site, which was used to fuse the ADAM-17 cDNA with the hemagglutinin-epitope. The integrity of the nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and C-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged ADAM-17 was expressed using the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Stable transfections of HEK-293 cells with either tagged ADAM-17 or the empty vector were performed by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfected HEK-293 cells were selected using G418 sulfate (1 mg/ml), and expression was confirmed by Western blotting using hemagglutinin antisera (not shown). Pro-VCC Is Monomeric in Solution—Fig. 1 depicts an SDS-PAGE of isolated recombinant pro-VCC (Fig. 1, lane 1) and VCC purified from bacterial culture supernatants (Fig. 1, lane 3). Trypsinized pro-VCC and mature VCC had identical hemolytic activity, and ∼40 ng/ml invoked 60% hemolysis of a 5 × 108 cells/ml erythrocyte suspension (data not shown). The relative mobility of mature VCC and pro-VCC in non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was determined. A Ferguson plot (Fig. 2) demonstrated that the proteins migrated as molecules of 65 and 79 kDa, respectively. When either pro-VCC or mature VCC was treated with cross-linking reagents such as dimethylsuberimidate, difluorodinitrobenzene, or disuccinimidyl-suberate in solution, no covalently bonded dimers or multimers were evident by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (data not shown). These data indicated that both pro-VCC and mature VCC are present in monomeric form in solution. Protoxin Is Cleaved and Activated After Binding to Cell Membranes—Incubation of nucleated cells with pro-VCC resulted in the reduction of cellular ATP levels, and dose-response curves were obtained that matched those obtained with mature VCC (Fig. 3). Pro-VCC and mature VCC were also found to have essentially identical hemolytic activity, whereby the rate of hemolysis provoked by pro-VCC was retarded. Thus, hemolysis end points were observed after an ∼2-h incubation with mature VCC and after 4 h with pro-VCC. A 60% hemolysis end point was provoked by ∼40 ng/ml of either toxin. As reported for mature VCC (34Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), hemolysis by pro-VCC was completely prevented in the presence of polyethylene glycol at osmotically protective concentrations. This observation indicated that procytolysin could form pores of similar size as those of the mature cytolysin. The above results led us to suspect that pro-VCC could bind to cells and be activated thereafter, possibly by an endogenous proteinase. To corroborate this contention, rabbit erythrocyte ghosts were incubated with pro-VCC or with mature VCC for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The results are shown in Fig. 4A. Pro-VCC migrated as a single band of 79 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 1). After incubation with erythrocyte ghosts, three membrane-bound toxin entities were detected: oligomer, unprocessed pro-VCC, and mature VCC (Fig. 4A, lane 2, unboiled sample). Boiling in SDS resulted in dissociation of the oligomer with predominant strengthening of the mature VCC-band (Fig. 4A, lane 3). When mature VCC (Fig. 4A, lane 4) was applied to the ghosts, membrane-bound toxin was detected predominantly in oligomeric form (Fig. 4A, lane 5), and boiling resulted in dissociation to yield the monomer (Fig. 4A, lane 6). These results indicated that pro-VCC could indeed bind to cells and be cleaved by an endogenous proteinase, and that mature VCC thus formed would assemble into the oligomeric VCC pore. The kinetics of spontaneous cleavage of cell-bound pro-VCC was investigated (Fig. 4B). Erythrocytes were incubated for 30 min with pro-VCC at 4 °C, and SDS-PAGE/Western blotting led to the detection of bound, unprocessed pro-VCC (Fig. 4B, lane 1). When the cells were post-incubated at 37 °C, it was found that the toxin assembled into SDS-resistant oligomers over time (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–5), and this was accompanied by hemolysis (not shown). After 2 h at 37 °C, the bulk of the toxin was converted to oligomers that were dissociated predominantly to the 65-kDa mature form after heating (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–9). In another experiment, protoxin was first bound to erythrocytes at 4 °C and then exposed to exogenous proteases for only 30 min. Results are shown for trypsin and dispase. In both cases, oligomers formed that, upon dissociation, again yielded the mature 65-kDa band (Fig. 4C). Hemolysis occurred within minutes after exposure to trypsin (not shown). Similar results were obtained with other tested proteases (proteinase K, type XVIII protease). Additional experiments were conducted with nucleated cells and similar results were obtained. We concluded that pro-VCC can bind both to erythrocytes and intestinal epithelial cells and subsequently can be activated by both endogenous and exogenous proteases. Inhibition Studies Indicate that a Cell-bound Metalloprotease Cleaves Pro-VCC—To obtain an indication of the nature of the endogenous protease involved in pro-VCC cleavage, specific protease inhibitors were used. In pilot experiments, hemolytic activity of pro-VCC was determined in the presence of various protease inhibitors. Agents that did not inhibit hemolysis were N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of thiol-proteinases; inhibitors of serine-proteinases such as Pefabloc™, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; pepstatin, which inhibits carboxyl-proteinases; a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche); and gelatinase inhibitor, which inhibits matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 (35Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) but not proteases belonging to the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) family (36Wolfsberg T.G. Straight P.D. Gerena R.L. Huovila A.P. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In contrast, TAPI, which inhibits metalloproteases (31Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Alderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarna K. Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), including those of the ADAM family, was found to fully suppress hemolysis (not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the specific action of TAPI. As shown in Fig. 5A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or gelatinase inhibitor did not prevent the formation of oligomers. In contrast, oligomerization was entirely absent in the presence of 50 μm TAPI. The inhibitor had no effect when pre-activated mature VCC was applied (Fig. 5A, lane 6), indicating that suppression of the proteolytic activation step was truly responsible for its protective action. Together, the results led us to conclude that the responsible protease may belong to the ADAM family of metalloproteases. Additional experiments were performed using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which is known to express furin (22Abrami L. Fivaz M. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Jean F. Thomas G. Leppla S.H.

As shown in Fig. 5B, similar results were obtained. Again, TAPI markedly suppressed cleavage and oligomer formation, whereas the furin inhibitor did not. ADAM-17 Activates Pro-VCC—Experiments were conducted with EC-2 cells that lacked ADAM-17 and the respective controls. Fig. 6A depicts the results of Western blots. Cells lacking ADAM-17 bound comparable amounts of protoxin at 4 °C (Fig. 6A, lane 2) as control cells (Fig. 6A, lane 3). Samples were washed and subsequently incubated at 37 °C. Oligomerization of VCC (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 4 and 6) and cleavage of pro-VCC (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 5 and 7) was markedly decreased in ADAM-17-deficient cells. The above findings were corroborated in experiments using transfected HEK-293 cells that over-expressed ADAM-17 (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6B, lane 1 shows the pro-VCC that was applied to the cells at 4 °C, and Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 3 show further incubation at 37 °C, with oligomerization visible in the unheated sample (Fig. 6B, lane 2) and cleaved toxin visible after heating (Fig. 6B, lane 3). Cleavage and oligomer formation in Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 2, respectively, was clearly enhanced in the ADAM-17-transfected cells (Fig. 6B, lane 6) compared with control cells (Fig. 6B, lane 5). Cleavage of Pro-VCC Precedes Oligomerization—Use of TAPI to inhibit processing of pro-VCC rendered it possible to determine which of two possible orders of events underlies pore formation. In the first scenario, pro-VCC would bind as monomer to membranes, undergo proteolytic cleavage, and the mature VCC would oligomerize and form a pore. In the second scenario, cell-bound pro-VCC would first form SDS-labile oligomers, and subsequent proteolytic cleavage would lead to pore-formation by SDS-resistant VCC oligomers. Cells were incubated with pro-VCC in the presence or absence of TAPI, and cross-linking was performed with DSS. In the absence of TAPI, oligomers were detected as expected, and they dissociated after boiling to yield the 65-kDa VCC monomer (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3). Cross-linking was found to prevent dissociation of these oligomers (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5). In the presence of TAPI, membrane-bound pro-VCC remained monomeric even after exposure to the cross-linker, indicating that pro-VCC oligomers were not formed (Fig. 7, lanes 6-9). Thus, proteolytic cleavage of pro-VCC is apparently required for oligomerization to take place. Fig. 8 depicts events that are proposed to lead to pore formation.Fig. 8Schematic representation of events leading to pore formation by VCC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Many publications describe the properties and biological activity of mature VCC. In contrast, little is known about pro-VCC, which is the naturally secreted form of the toxin. The present investigation was undertaken to fill this information gap. We employed a recombinant pro-VCC containing a His6 tag at the N-terminal region. This tag has been shown not to interfere with binding and function of other toxins such as staphylococcal leukocidin and clostridial α-toxin (37Miles G. Cheley S. Braha O. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8514-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Hong Y. Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kang J.Y. Shime H. Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F.G. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5047-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Three controls were performed to ascertain that the tag also did not create artifacts in our system. First, binding and hemolytic assays were performed over a pH range of 5.0–8.0 (spanning the pKa of histidine), with no difference in outcome. Second, recombinant pro-VCC was expressed using a thioredoxin tag instead of His6, and the protein had similar binding and poreforming properties (not shown). Third, when the His6 tag was added to native 65-kDa VCC, the purified protein entirely lacked binding properties because of irreversible denaturation by guanidine. Thus, the His6 tag itself was devoid of binding properties. There are striking similarities, but also clear differences, in the mode of action of aerolysin and VCC. Both are secreted as protoxins, both require proteolytic activation, and both build oligomeric transmembrane pores. On the other hand, however, pro-aerolysin exists as a dimer in solution (39Barry R. Morre S. Alonso A. Ausio J. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Fivaz M. Velluz M.-C. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37705-37708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas pro-VCC is monomeric. Also, pro-aerolysin binds as a dimer to membranes, whereas cell-bound pro-VCC seems to remain monomeric prior to cleavage. Bound pro-aerolysin is processed by furin, but a metalloproteinase is likely responsible in the case of pro-VCC. In situ activation by furin has been described for other bacterial pore-forming toxins, and the present study is the first to discover a similar role for an endogenous metalloproteinase. By making use of a cell line in which the metalloproteinase ADAM-17 was overexpressed, we identified this enzyme as an important activator of pro-VCC. In line with this observation, inactivation of ADAM-17 led to decreased processing of pro-VCC. Although several related ADAM proteins are simultaneously expressed in cells, this did not compensate for the absence of ADAM-17. Together, these results directly identify ADAM-17 as a potent activator of pro-VCC. Why processing of pro-VCC should occur through the action of a cellular metalloproteinase is unclear, especially in view of the fact that no demands on specificity could be discerned when exogenous proteinases were applied to the cell-bound protoxin. We are not aware that this type of experiment has been performed for aerolysin, and future comparison of the results would be of interest. It is tempting to speculate that processing of bound protoxin by an endogenous proteinase may be primarily influenced not by specificity, but instead by the accessibility of the substrate to its enzyme. Pro-VCC contains a lectin domain (20Olson R. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that is absent in aerolysin, and perhaps this domain targets the toxin to membrane sites that contain or are accessible to endogenous metalloproteinases, but not to furin. TAPI-inhibitable metalloproteinases are known to cleave their substrates at sites very close to the surface of the lipid bilayer (41Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and we envisage the cleavage site in pro-VCC to become deeply embedded in the extracellular membrane glycocalyx and to be positioned ideally for cleavage by the processing enzyme. Targeting to such sites may simultaneously serve to cluster the toxin molecules, rendering their rapid oligomerization possible after activation. In sum, pro-VCC seems to be targeted to membranes of mammalian cells, and effective processing can subsequently occur by the action of both exogenous and endogenous proteinases. This would guarantee that the toxin can exert its potent cytotoxic activity in a wide variety of biological settings. We thank Rolf Streeck for critical reading of the manuscript and Roy Black for kindly providing murine ADAM-17 cDNA and for also making available the EC-4 and knock-out cell lines, which were generously given to us by Peter Altevogt."
https://openalex.org/W2048545091,"Understanding of the chemical nature of the dioxygen and nitric oxide moiety of ba3 -cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus is crucial for elucidation of its physiological function. In the present work, direct resonance Raman (RR) observation of the Fe–C–O stretching and bending modes and the C–O stretching mode of the CuB-CO complex unambiguously establishes the vibrational characteristics of the heme-copper moiety in ba3-oxidase. We assigned the bands at 507 and 568 cm–1 to the Fe-CO stretching and Fe–C–O bending modes, respectively. The frequencies of these modes in conjunction with the C–O mode at 1973 cm– 1 showed, despite the extreme values of the Fe-CO and C–O stretching vibrations, the presence of the α-conformation in the catalytic center of the enzyme. These data, distinctly different from those observed for the caa3 -oxidase, are discussed in terms of the proposed coupling of the α-and β-conformations that occur in the binuclear center of heme-copper oxidases with enzymatic activity. The CuB-CO complex was identified by its ν(CO) at 2053 cm– 1 and was strongly enhanced with 413.1 nm excitation indicating the presence of a metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition state near 410 nm. These findings provide, for the first time, RR vibrational information on the EPR silent CuB(I) that is located at the O2 delivery channel and has been proposed to play a crucial role in both the catalytic and proton pumping mechanisms of heme-copper oxidases. Understanding of the chemical nature of the dioxygen and nitric oxide moiety of ba3 -cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus is crucial for elucidation of its physiological function. In the present work, direct resonance Raman (RR) observation of the Fe–C–O stretching and bending modes and the C–O stretching mode of the CuB-CO complex unambiguously establishes the vibrational characteristics of the heme-copper moiety in ba3-oxidase. We assigned the bands at 507 and 568 cm–1 to the Fe-CO stretching and Fe–C–O bending modes, respectively. The frequencies of these modes in conjunction with the C–O mode at 1973 cm– 1 showed, despite the extreme values of the Fe-CO and C–O stretching vibrations, the presence of the α-conformation in the catalytic center of the enzyme.

Cytochromes ba3 and caa3 serve as the terminal heme-copper oxidases in the Gram-negative thermophilic eubacterium Thermus thermophilus (1Soulimane T. Buse G. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R.

Both enzymes couple the reduction of dioxygen to proton translocation across the inner bacterial membrane, and in contrast to the eucaryotic heme-copper oxidases, catalyze the reduction of NO to N2O (1Soulimane T.

The FTIR 1The abbreviations used are: FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; RR, resonance Raman; MLCT, metal-to-ligand charge transfer; W, watt. and time-resolved FTIR studies of the CO-bound fully reduced form of ba3 have revealed several unique characteristics of the enzyme including the formation of the equilibrium CuB-CO complex and the identification of a ligand docking site (4Koutsoupakis K.

It was reported that the rate of decay of the transient CuB-CO complex that is produced from the photolysis of complex B (Scheme 1) is 34. 5 s–1 and rebinding to heme a3 occurs with k2 = 28.6 s–1 (4Koutsoupakis K.

The ν(CO) of the transient CuB-CO species at 2053 cm–1 is the same as that of the equilibrium CuB-CO species and remained unchanged in the pH and pD 5.5–10 ranges, indicating that no structural change takes place at CuB between these states (4Koutsoupakis K.

Recently, the role of the ring A propionate of heme a3-Asp372-H2O site as a proton carrier to the exit/output proton channel (H2O pool) that is conserved among all structurally known heme-copper oxidases and is part of the Q-proton pathway in ba3-cytochrome c oxidase was reported (8Koutsoupakis C. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2438-2444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further FTIR studies provided solid evidence that in cytochrome ba3 the ligand delivery channel is located at the CuB site, which is the ligand entry to the heme a3 pocket (5Koutsoupakis K.

It was suggested that the properties of the O2 channel are not limited to facilitating ligand diffusion to the active site but are extended in controlling the dynamics and reactivity of the reactions of ba3 with O2 and NO. Therefore, it is of particular interest to gain insight into the environment of the spectroscopic silent CuB. Resonance Raman (RR) is a structure-sensitive technique, and thus, data of the CO-bound adducts of ba3 can be interpreted to yield specific information concerning heme/CuB geometric properties and heme/CuB-axial ligand bonding interactions (10Pinakoulaki E.

Although the presence of one or the other conformation has been implicated in the enzymatic activity of heme-copper oxidases, their functional significance remains to be determined (14Wang J. Takahasi S. Hosler J.P. Mitchel D.M. Fergusson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have studied the CO-bound ba3 oxidase by RR with the aim to fully characterize complexes A and B and thus to explore the proposed role of CuB in the formation of either the α- or the β-conformation and to determine the significance of the α- and β-conformations in the enzymatic activity of heme-copper oxidases. Our data demonstrate, despite the extreme values of the Fe-CO and C–O stretching vibrations at 507 and 1973 cm–1, respectively, the presence of the α-conformation in the catalytic site of the enzyme. The analysis of the data also reveals that the environment of CuB does not control the strength of the Fe–C bond and thus the type of conformation of the binuclear center. The results presented here and those of caa3, in contrast to previous reports, demonstrate that enzymatic activity is not controlled by the type of conformation (α or β) of the binuclear center. We have also made the novel RR characterization of the CuB-CO complex by its CO stretching frequency at 2053 cm–1. The 2053 cm–1 band, as opposed to 507 and 1973 cm–1 bands, is more readily observed with 413.1 nm RR excitation than with 428.7 nm excitation, indicating the presence of a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) CuB-CO transition state near 410 nm. This observation provides for the first time an indication as to how to exploit the environment of the spectroscopic silent CuB center that has been implicated not only in the catalytic properties of heme-copper oxidases but also in the proton pumping mechanisms.

Resonance Raman spectra were obtained from 40–50 μm samples, pH 7.5, in a cylindrical quartz spinning cell. The RR data were acquired as described elsewhere (10Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B.

FTIR spectra were recorded from 400 μm samples at 4 cm–1 resolution with a Bruker Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. The fully reduced CO samples were anaerobically loaded into a cell with CaF2 windows and a 0.025-mm spacer. An average of 2000 scans was used for each spectrum.

We detect two modes that have carbon and oxygen isotopic sensitivity. The shifts are more evident in the difference spectrum (trace c) between the 12C16O- and 13C18O-bound states.

In addition, the shift of the weak mode at 568 cm–1 (trace a) to 550 cm–1 (trace b) also appears in the isotope difference spectrum (trace c).

The difference spectrum (trace a) between 12C16O- and 13C18O-bound states demonstrates the presence of modes at 1973 (12C16O) and 1884 (13C18O) cm–1. We assign the 1973 cm–1 mode to the CO stretching vibration of Fe-CO (complex B). In trace b we display the difference spectrum obtained at higher laser power (500 μW). Under these conditions partial photodissociation of Fe-CO (complex B) is observed. This effect causes the migration of CO to CuB, and in conjunction with 1) the unusual long lifetime (4Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32860-32866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) of the CuB-CO species (t½ = 20.1 ms) and 2) the presence of the equilibrium complex A, we observe the C–O mode of Cu -CO at 2053 cm– B 1. For 13C18O this mode shifts to 1959 cm–1, confirming the assignment. The observed CO stretching vibrations are very similar to those obtained by FTIR (trace c). The 413.1 nm excitation RR data shown in Fig. 2B were obtained under the same conditions as those in Fig. 2A, trace b. Comparison of trace b, Fig. 2A with trace c, Fig. 2B shows that the band pair 2053/1959 cm–1 is more enhanced with 413.1 nm excitation. The opposite occurs for the 1973/1884 cm–1 band pair. It is readily observed with 428.7 nm excitation, but it has lost most of its intensity in the 413.1 nm excitation spectra. This is consistent with the optical absorption spectrum of the CO-bound heme a3 at λmax = 430 nm (4Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol.

We attribute the increased intensity of the 2053/1959 cm–1 band pair to the presence of a CuB-CO MLCT transition near 410 nm. We have been unable, however, to detect it by absorption spectroscopy because it is obscured by the strong Soret transition. Our assignment finds support from the absorption spectrum of the CO bound form of copper/topa quinone-containing amine oxidase from Arthrobactor globiformis where two transitions with maximum absorbance at 334 and 434 nm were observed (20Hirota S.

The molecular origin for the heme Fe-CuB binuclear center of heme-copper oxidases that is responsible for the unique Fe–C–O modes is of significant interest. The frequencies of the Fe-CO and C–O modes of CO-bound ba3 oxidase are the lowest and highest, respectively, ever reported among the heme a3-containing heme-copper oxidases. Nevertheless, the ν(Fe-CO) and ν(CO) frequencies fall on the correlation curve for the α-form of the enzyme and suggest that it has the same structure as that of the major form of the aa3-type oxidases (10Pinakoulaki E.

A high Iδ/Iν (intensity of bending mode/intensity of stretching mode) is an indication of a strong interaction between the CO and CuB (10Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol.

Although the frequencies we detect in ba3 are quite different from those reported for the aa3-type oxidases, the Iδ/Iν (0.3) is very similar. Thus, CuB exerts similar steric forces to Fe–C–O in the ba3- and aa3-type oxidases. The anomalously high frequency of the Fe-CO stretching mode at 517–524 cm–1 in the α-form of the aa3- and bo3-type oxidases has also been attributed to distal effects exerted by CuB (12Argade P.V.

The frequency of the ν(Fe-CO) in ba3 is close to those of model heme and heme proteins and of the β-form of heme-copper oxidases in which CO can bind to the heme Fe without anomalous polar or steric interactions (14Wang J. Takahasi S. Hosler J.P. Mitchel D.M. Fergusson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Das T.K. Tomson F.K. Gennis R.B.

Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3390-3391Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Based on the above arguments, the low frequency of ν(Fe-CO) in ba3 cannot be attributed only to distal effects caused by CuB to the bound CO. It is known that ν(Fe-CO) and ν(CO) reflect both the identity and properties of the proximal ligand because the bound CO competes with the proximal ligand for the same d 2z orbital and the polarity of the distal heme pocket (10Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13563-13568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A highly polar environment favors π-back donation, resulting in an increased ν(Fe-CO) and reduced ν(CO) due to the increased density in the CO antibonding orbitals. Taken together, the present results and those recently reported for the aa3-type oxidases indicate that CuB contributes to distort the Fe–C–O group from its axial symmetry so that the bending vibration is enhanced but does not affect the strength of the Fe-CO bond. In the absence of polar interactions, we suggest that the strength of the proximal histidine (His384) H-bonding interaction affects the strength of the Fe–C and C–O bonds. This explanation finds support from the crystal structure of ba3 where it has been shown that the distance from Nδ of His384 to the carbonyl of Gly359 is 3.43 Å (H-bonding distance). In the past, it has been suggested that the major conformations (α and β) at the binuclear center and the existence of equilibrium between them might have significant importance in the enzymatic activity of heme-copper oxidases (14Wang J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9446-9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For instance, in certain mutant heme-copper oxidases, low frequency Fe-CO stretching modes were detected (β-form), and the enzyme had no dioxygen reduction activity (19Hosler P.H. Kim Shapleigh J.P. Gennis R.B. Alben J.O. Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5515-5516Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, due to the presence of both forms the activity of the population with the β-form could not be determined. The α- and β-conformational states of heme-copper oxidases, although their functional significance and the origin for the splitting have not been established, have been attributed to changes in the distance between the iron atom of heme a3 and CuB (10Pinakoulaki E.

J. 2001; 80: 2039-2045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was postulated that the different structures result from a change in the position of the CuB atom with respect to the Fe-CO due to the presence of one or more ionizable groups (14Wang J. Takahasi S. Hosler J.P. Mitchel D.M. Fergusson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Das T.K. Tomson F.K. Gennis R.B.

Possible candidates included the cross-linked, conserved tyrosine that is adjacent to the oxygen-binding pocket or one of the histidines that coordinate CuB. We have recently demonstrated that that the absence of the farnesyl-tyrosine linkage has no direct control on the ν(CO) stretching frequency and thus on the type (α or β) of the stable conformation that is present in heme-copper oxidases (4Koutsoupakis K.

Soc. 2002; 124: 3814-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has also been established that the CuB-His environment is very rigid and not subject to conformational transitions that are associated with protonation/deprotonation events of the CuB His ligands (5Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14893-14896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The binuclear centers of ba3 (α-form) and caa3 (β-form) oxidases contain the conserved tyrosine; therefore, we can exclude that the cross-linked tyrosine provides the ionizable group that causes the heme-CuB distance to change. In the absence of any evidence regarding the involvement of functional groups associated within the binuclear center, we suggest that the presence of one or more ionizable groups near the binuclear center that affect the heme a3-CO CuB distance are the cause of the observed conformations observed in aa3 oxidases. Given that the binuclear centers in ba3 and its counterpart caa3 oxidase are very similar, the same argument holds for the absence of the β-form in ba3 oxidase but its presence in its counterpart caa3. Taken together, the present data and data previously reported (4Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Pinakoulaki E. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol.

The CuB-CO Complex—The variation of ν(CO) in mononuclear Cu-containing proteins has been attributed to changes in the coordination structure of the metal (20Hirota S. Iwamoto T. Tanizawa K. Adachi O. Yamauchi O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14256-14263Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The insensitivity of the ν(CO) of CuB frequency to H2O/D2O exchange and to pH/pD 5.5–9.7 range indicated that the degree of back-donation of electron density from the d orbitals to the antibonding π* orbitals is not altered under these conditions (5Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14893-14896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Koutsoupakis C. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2438-2444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the presence of small amounts of O2, however, the ν(C–O) of CuB1+ -CO at 2053 cm–1 (complex A) shifts to 2045 cm–1 and remains unchanged in H2O/D2O exchanges and in the pH 6.5–9.0 range (5Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Soulimane T. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14893-14896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This observation was attributed to an increased electron density in the CO antibonding orbitals that results in weakening the C–O bond strength (lower νCO). It was concluded that the change in the ν(CO) of complex A results in an increase of k–2 and thus to a higher affinity of CuB for exogenous ligands. The nature of ligands coordinated to the metal in copper proteins has been of particular interest but difficult to determine, since conformational and/or chemical changes in the proteins may lead to ligand exchanges by the EPR silent copper (I). Although we have identified additional vibrations in the RR spectra (data not shown) that can be attributed to the internal vibrations of CuB-(N-His), the insufficient amounts, so far, of 15N-enriched enzyme have prevented us from collecting high quality RR data of the 15N-enriched enzyme. Therefore, it remains to be established whether internal ligand motions are resonance-enhanced, either because the ligand coordinates themselves are displaced upon MLCT excitation or the ligand coordinates contribute to ground-state normal modes that involve CuB-L(N) stretching coordinates. In summary, the unique CO binding properties of ba3 oxidase have allowed us, first, to investigate from the frequencies and intensities of Fe–C–O the role of CuB in the structure of this coordinated ligand. We suggest that CuB maintains the same role in the structure of the physiological coordinated ligands, such as NO and O2. This way, the role of CuB in the structure-function relationship has been established. Second, we have identified the CuB-CO complex by its ν(CO) at 2053 cm–1. The ν(CO) is strongly enhanced with 413.1 nm excitation indicating the presence of a metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition state near 410 nm. The RR identification of the CuB-CO complex provides us direct access, for the first time, to spectroscopic silent CuB site under steady state conditions. This way, the environment of CuB that has been implicated in both the O2 delivery channel and proton translocation mechanisms can now be explored (5Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S. Soulimane T.

The classical PKCβI and PKCβII isoenzymes provide a unique opportunity because they are the alternatively spliced products of the β gene and are 100% identical except for the last 50 of 52 amino acids. In this study, it is shown that green fluorescent protein-tagged PKCβII and not PKCβI translocates to a recently described juxtanuclear site of localization for PKCα and PKCβII isoenzymes that arises with sustained stimulation of PKC. Mechanistically, translocation of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear region required kinase activity. PKCβII, but not PKCβI, was found to activate phospholipase D within this time frame. Inhibitors of phospholipase D (1-butanol and a dominant negative construct) prevented the translocation of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear region but not to the plasma membrane, thus demonstrating a role for phospholipase D in the juxtanuclear translocation of PKCβII.

PKC currently consists of 11 closely related isoenzymes that can be grouped into 3 subfamilies (classical, novel, and atypical) on the basis of lipid cofactor requirements and structural homology (1Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 2Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A major form of cellular regulation of PKC involves the dynamic redistribution or “translocation” of PKC isoenzymes from cytosol to the plasma membrane. Membrane translocation of PKC is regulated through receptor-coupled lipid hydrolases that act on phosphoinositides and phosphatidylcholine to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) lipid second messengers. The recruitment and activation of PKC at membranes also link activation of the enzyme to the proximity of membrane protein substrates (3Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). One of the major targets of PKC is phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PC-PLD) (4Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated PC-PLD hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond of phosphatidylcholine to generate free choline and phosphatidic acid, which is converted to DAG through the actions of lipid phosphate phosphatases. DAG derived from phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis has been proposed to mediate the reciprocal regulation of PKC, but there are incomplete and conflicting data on this topic (5Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Wright T.M. Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possible functional significance of PC-PLD-derived DAG arises from the sustained presence of DAG in the membrane for extended periods of time and in relatively high concentrations in comparison with DAG derived from phosphoinositide-specific PLC, and this phosphatidylcholine-derived DAG has been proposed to mediate long-term cellular processes that require sustained PKC activation (8Billah M.M. Anthes J.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The implication of specific PKC isoenzymes in distinct pathological processes has led to an intense effort to identify and elucidate the mechanisms that regulate isoenzyme-specific functions of PKC. To date, these efforts have been complicated by the large number of highly homologous PKC family members, expression of multiple PKC isoenzymes in each cell type, and the finding that there are only minor differences in substrate selectivity among different PKCs. One of the best opportunities to study the mechanisms of isoenzyme specificity arises from the alternatively spliced gene products of the classical PKC (cPKC) β gene. This alternative splicing creates two proteins, PKCβI and PKCβII, which display 100% identity over their first 621 amino acids but then diverge in the last 50–52 carboxyl-terminal residues, which are encoded by two consecutive and alternatively spliced exons (9Ono Y. Kurokawa T. Fujii T. Kawahara K. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Importantly, these divergences are 100% conserved across rat, rabbit, and human, suggesting that there are distinct functions encoded by both gene products. To that end, we previously identified residues in the carboxyl terminus of PKCβII that are homologous to actin-binding proteins (10Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that with long-term stimulation with phorbol esters, PKCβII differentially interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, where it becomes activated and is then protected from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced down-regulation. In another line of investigation, we have recently reported that sustained stimulation (45–60 min) of PKC with DAG-mimicking phorbol and non-phorbol PKC agonists can induce the translocation of PKCα and PKCβII to a subcomponent of the endosomal recycling compartment concentrated in a juxtanuclear location around the microtubule-organizing center/centrosome (11Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies with a fluorescence-conjugated transferrin ligand as a marker of membrane trafficking demonstrated that the cPKC-positive compartment functions to sequester membrane recycling components. In this study, we investigated the isoenzyme specificity of this novel translocation and found that whereas PKCα and PKCβII translocated to the juxtanuclear compartment, PKCβI did not. Further analysis showed that PKCβII translocation to this compartment required kinase activity, implicating a substrate-dependent interaction. The specificity for PKCβII versus PKCβI and the requirement for kinase activity raised the possibility that PC-PLD may be involved in the process. Evidence is provided to implicate PLD in the selective translocation of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear compartment. These results define a novel pathway of translocation of PKCβII requiring differential activation of PLD. These data suggest that PKCβII differentially activates PLD and that this is required for the mechanism of translocation to the subset of juxtanuclear recycling endosomes.

Cells were allowed to recover in serum-free media at 37 °C for 30 min before stimulation. Ten min before stimulation, 0.4% 1-butanol was added to the cells. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm PMA for the specified times and at the noted concentrations. All incubations were performed at 37 °C. After stimulation, the culture media were removed, and the cells were washed rapidly three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Total cellular membranes were extracted via the method of Bligh and Dyer (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Lipids were dried down and resuspended in 75 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1). Fifty μl of the 75-μl volume was loaded per lane. The TLC solvent system consisted of ethyl acetate:iso-octane:acetic acid (9:5:2). A phosphatidyl-butanol standard (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) was included in parallel to confirm lipid species. The plate was sprayed with EN3HANCE Spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to amplify the tritium signal and exposed for autoradiography for 24 h. The phosphatidyl-butanol band and the total remaining lipids were scraped and counted separately. The [3H]phosphatidylbutanol band was compared with total labeled lipids to generate the percentage of increase over total labeled lipid. Each experiment was repeated three to five times. Isoenzyme-specific Translocation of PKCβII to a Subset of Recycling Endosomes—To investigate the isoenzyme specificity of PKCβ translocation to the subset of recycling endosomes centered around the microtubule-organizing center/centrosome described previously (Ref. 11Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a GFP-tagged PKCβIorPKCβII construct and stimulated with PMA for 1 h. Confocal microscopic imaging revealed that in the absence of phorbol ester stimulation, both GFP-tagged cPKC isoenzymes displayed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization with exclusion from the nucleus (Fig. 1, A and B, panels 1). Addition of 100 nm PMA for 1 h induced translocation of GFP-PKCβII to both the plasma membrane and the juxtanuclear location (Fig. 1A, panel 2). In contrast, stimulation of GFP-PKCβI with PMA for 1 h resulted in the translocation of PKCβI to the plasma membrane only, and no further translocation was evident (Fig. 1B, panel 2). These results suggest that amino acid residues encoded within the carboxyl terminus of PKCβI and PKCβII determine the specificity for translocation of PKCβII to this subset of recycling endosomes. To control for the possibility that the specificity of translocation for the two cPKC isoenzymes was related to different rates of translocation, a time course experiment was performed at 0, 1, 3, and 6 h. No juxtanuclear translocation of PKCβ1 was evident at any time point, suggesting that the differences between translocation were not related to rates of the process (data not shown). Of note, in a previous study, Blobe et al. (10Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) stated that PKCβII contained actin binding sequences within its carboxyl terminus not found in PKCβI. Given the above-mentioned results, we examined the cellular actin pattern during translocation of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear compartment. It was observed that upon stimulation with PMA for 1 h, there was a concentration of actin at the juxtanuclear location and that this overlapped with translocated GFP-PKCβII (Fig. 2, A and B). These results reveal a significant effect of PMA on the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and they demonstrate a co-localization of PKCβII but not PKCβI with the reorganized actin. Moreover, treatment of cells with cytochalasin D, which depolymerizes actin, caused partial unraveling of the pericentriolar actin and of the associated PKCβII, which acquired a whorl-like appearance in the presence of cytochalasin D (Fig. 2C). These results confirm and extend the previous finding of in vitro and cellular association of PKCβII (and not PKCβI) with the actin cytoskeleton. Kinase Activity Is Required for Translocation of PKCβII to the Juxtanuclear Compartment—To investigate the role of kinase activity in the translocation of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear compartment, HeLa cells transfected with GFP-PKCβII were stimulated with PMA, with or without a 30-min preincubation with 3 μm Gö 6976, a specific inhibitor of the calcium-dependent PKC isoenzymes (15Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3A, panels 1 and 2, when the kinase activity of PKCβII was inhibited with Gö 6976, PKCβII translocated to the plasma membrane, but there was no further translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment. This requirement for kinase activity was further probed using a kinase-defective GFP-tagged PKCβII mutant K371R, which is unable to bind ATP and phosphorylate PKC substrates. When stimulated with PMA for 1 h, GFP-K371R-βII was observed to translocate to the plasma membrane, but no juxtanuclear accumulation was evident (Fig. 3B, panels 1 and 2). These data demonstrate that PKCβII translocation to the plasma membrane occurs independent of kinase activity but that kinase activity is required for translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment. PC-PLD Is Activated in a Time- and PKC-dependent Manner during the Sustained Stimulation of PKC with Phorbol Esters—PC-PLD1 is a major downstream target for calcium dependent, DAG/PMA-sensitive cPKC isoenzymes. Currently, there are some data demonstrating isoenzyme-specific differences in the cPKC regulation of PLD, including differences between PKCβI and cPKCβII (see “Discussion”). In addition, very recently, Hu and Exton (16Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2348-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that the full-length rat PKCα isoenzyme binds and activates PC-PLD1 and that this was dependent on the presence of a phenylalanine residue (Phe663) in the V5 carboxyl terminus of PKCα. These data implicate a possible role for the V5 variable region of PKC in the PKC-PLD interaction. These observations, coupled with the requirement for kinase activity for PKCβII translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment, raised the possibility that the mechanism of this translocation may involve the activation of PLD1. To begin to explore this hypothesis, it was important first to establish whether PLD was activated in this system. Using a transphosphatidylation assay with 1-butanol to evaluate cellular PLD activity, HEK 293 cells were treated with 100 nm PMA. As seen in Fig. 4A, phosphatidyl-butanol accumulation, indicating PLD activity, was evident starting at 30–40 min of PMA stimulation. Importantly, this activation was completely blocked by preincubation with 3 μm of the selective cPKC inhibitor Gö 6976 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, this time frame of PLD activation correlated closely with the translocation of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear compartment. To determine whether PKCβI and PKCβII regulated PLD differentially, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with each PKC isoenzyme, and the transphosphatidylation reaction was assayed. For each experiment, the efficiency of transfection was similar for both isoenzymes and ranged between 40% and 50% of total cell population. Interestingly, in cells that were transfected with PKCβII, there was a higher basal level of PLD activity in the absence of phorbol stimulation when compared with PKCβI. Upon stimulation with PMA, cells that expressed PKCβII demonstrated a 50% increase in phosphatidyl-butanol accumulation (Fig. 4B). In contrast, there was no further stimulation of PLD in cells overexpressing PKCβI. These data disclose significant isoenzyme specificity of activation of PLD by cPKC, and they also suggest the possibility that the isoenzyme specificity in translocation of PKCβ isoenzymes to the juxtanuclear compartment may be related to the differential activation of PLD. Translocation of PKCβII to the Juxtanuclear Compartment Is Dependent upon PLD Activity—To investigate whether PLD activity is required for translocation of PKC to the juxtanuclear compartment, 1-butanol was utilized as an inhibitor of PLD activity. HEK 293 cells were preincubated with 0.4% 1-butanol for 10 min before a 1-h stimulation with PMA. Preincubation with 1-butanol had no effect on the translocation of PKCβII to the plasma membrane, but there was a complete inhibition of the translocation of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear location (Fig. 5A, panels 1 and 2). This inhibition was specific for the primary alcohol because the secondary alcohol 2-butanol did not block translocation (data not shown). To confirm this pharmacological inhibition, a catalytically deficient mutant PLD, KR-PLD1, was cotransfected along with GFP-PKCβII into HEK 293 cells, and trafficking of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear compartment was evaluated. When GFP-PKCβII was stimulated with PMA for 1 h, the co-expression of KR-PLD1 did not inhibit the translocation of PKCβII to the plasma membrane, but there was no translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment (Fig. 5B). The ability of the KR-PLD1 mutant to inhibit PLD was evaluated in a transphosphatidylation assay that was performed in parallel with the confocal studies. Transient transfection of KR-PLD1 reduced endogenous PLD activity by ∼50% (Fig. 5C), thus confirming that KR-PLD1 inhibited cellular PLD activity. These data demonstrate that PLD activity is involved in the translocation of cPKC to a subset of recycling endosomes. In the present study, we have identified a role for the carboxyl-terminal V5 variable region in the differential subcellular localization of PKCβ isoenzymes to a recently defined novel intracellular target of translocation of PKCβ that co-localizes with the microtubule-organizing center/centrosome (11Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Investigation into the mechanism revealed that PKCβII translocation to this juxtanuclear compartment, unlike translocation to the plasma membrane, required kinase activity of PKC. The results also revealed differential activation of PLD by PKCβII and not PKCβI. Finally, the results disclosed a critical role for PLD in the differential juxtanuclear translocation of PKCβII. Thus, these data define an isoenzyme-specific function for cPKC in the regulation of PLD and, in turn, the reciprocal regulation of PKC by PLD through the modulation of PKC subcellular localization. Isoenzyme-specific differences in the subcellular localization and function of PKCβI and PKCβII have been reported previously. Using indirect immunofluorescence and monoclonal antibodies, several groups have observed an isoenzyme-specific association of PKCβII with the actin cytoskeleton (17Goodnight J.A. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 18Disatnik M.H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, Blobe et al. (10Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) identified an actin-binding sequence (ABS-1) located within the V5 region of PKCβII that was absent from PKCβI. This sequence was found to be necessary for the phorbol ester-induced translocation of PKCβII to the actin cytoskeleton and for isoenzyme-specific functions associated with this translocation, including protection from down-regulation. Furthermore, Yamamoto et al. (19Yamamoto M. Acevedo-Duncan M. Chalfant C.E. Patel N.A. Watson J.E. Cooper D.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) identified specific and opposing functional roles for the PKCβ isoenzymes in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells. They reported that upon overexpression of PKCβI, there was a stimulation of cell proliferation, whereas PKCβII overexpression was inhibitory to cell proliferation. This is supported by other data wherein the selective regulation of the expression of PKCβ isoenzymes occurs through differential splicing in lymphoid cells (20Blobe G.C. Khan W.A. Halpern A.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10627-10635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto M. Acevedo-Duncan M. Chalfant C.E. Patel N.A. Watson J.E. Cooper D.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C587-C595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these studies, there are also a number of other studies that have proposed specific subcellular localization and/or functions for either one or the other isoenzyme, but in most cases there was no direct comparison between PKCβI and PKCβII, and it is not known whether the proposed functions are isoenzyme-specific (22Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results from this study define a very clear difference in the translocation of PKCβI and PKCβII such that only PKCβII translocates to the juxtanuclear region. PC-PLD is a major downstream target for PKC. Data from overexpression studies and in vitro experiments with purified or recombinant protein indicate that it is the calcium-dependent cPKC isoenzymes (α and β) that are the primary PKC regulators of PLD in the cell (23Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Conricode K.M. Smith J.L. Burns D.J. Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are some data to suggest possible isoenzyme-specific differences between PKCβI and PKCβII. For instance, a role for PKCβ1 has been suggested through the examination of PLD activity in cells that stably overexpressed PKCβ1 and displayed an enhanced formation of DAG in response to phorbol ester treatment (27Pachter J.A. Pai J.K. Mayer-Ezell R. Petrin J.M. Dobek E. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9826-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pai J.K. Pachter J.A. Weinstein I.B. Bishop W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results were further supported with studies that used purified PKC and a cell-free system to demonstrate a rank order of potency for PLD activation with “PKC beta 1 > alpha > gamma and beta 2” showing little or no activity (25Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19465-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these studies are in apparent conflict with the current study. However, while researching the literature, it was discovered that there had been an inconsistency in the nomenclature that was applied initially to the PKCβ isoenzymes. Whereas Ono et al. (29Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) proposed to name the 673-amino acid splice product, PKCβII, and the 671-amino acid protein PKCβI, Coussens et al. (30Coussens L. Rhee L. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. DNA (N. Y.). 1987; 6: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) referred to the 673-amino acid splice product as “PKC beta I” and the shorter, 671-amino acid splice product as “PKC beta II.” Currently, the accepted nomenclature is that the longer gene product is PKCβII and the shorter one, PKCβI (31Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Importantly, a very recent report by Hu and Exton (16Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2348-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) identified residues in the carboxyl terminus of PKCα as critical to the activation of PLD by PKC. It is noteworthy that the carboxyl domain of PKCα shows higher homology to the carboxyl domain of PKCβII than PKCβI. These results underscore the importance of the variable region in the PKC-PLD relationship. Coupled with the results from this study implicating PLD in the juxtanuclear translocation of PKCβII, the differential activation of PLD by PKCβII and PKCβI provides a mechanistic explanation for the selective translocation of PKCβII to the juxtanuclear region. In addition, these results raise the possibility that sustained activation (30–60 min) of DAG/PMA-responsive PKC may disclose novel isoenzyme-specific functions arising from differential subcellular localization. This could potentially lead to disparate isoenzyme effects secondary to differential down-regulation and the differential access to compartmentalized substrates. It is interesting that we found the compartment to overlap with actin because this is predicted from the study of Blobe et al. (10Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), who demonstrated biochemically that the differential interaction of PKCβII with actin prevented PMA-induced down-regulation. In our previous study, we showed that the juxtanuclear translocation of PKCβII and PKCα regulates the kinetics of the recycling endosomes such that a component of those endosomes becomes sequestered in this juxtanuclear region. The findings of isoenzyme specificity of translocation and interaction with PLD and the role of PLD in the juxtanuclear translocation of PKCβII therefore suggest specific roles for the PKCα/PKCβII-PLD pathway in regulation of membrane recycling. One interesting question raised by the current findings is the mechanism by which PLD participates in/regulates juxtanuclear translocation of PKC. The results with the K/R mutant of PLD, which appears to function as a dominant negative, establish the role of PLD in this process. The observation that overexpression of the KR-PLD1 reduces cellular PLD activity by 50% but completely blocks PKC translocation to the juxtanuclear compartment suggests that there is a requirement for a specific subcellular pool of PLD activity in the translocation event. That is, KR-PLD1, which in our system localizes in a pattern similar to wild-type PLD1 (Fig. 5; data not shown), may act to specifically inhibit the PLD1 isoform in that specific compartment but may not inhibit PLD2. Moreover, the results with 1-butanol demonstrate a specific requirement for PLD activity and, presumably, the production of its product, phosphatidic acid. It would be of interest to determine the mechanism by which phosphatidic acid regulates this translocation. (Whereas the current results do not distinguish whether it is phosphatidic acid or a subsequent metabolism to DAG that is required for this translocation, it is presumed that PMA would circumvent the requirement for DAG, thus pointing to a role for phosphatidic acid itself.) In conclusion, these studies identify specific differences in the function of PKCβI and PKCβII relating to activation of PLD and juxtanuclear translocation. Moreover, understanding this juxtanuclear translocation promises novel insight into a novel paradigm of PKC function whereby sustained activation results in selective translocation to a novel compartment with selective functions.

https://openalex.org/W2090404591,"Tuberin (TSC2) is a tumor suppressor gene. At the cellular level, tuberin is required as a critical regulator of cell growth, neuronal differentiation (Soucek, T., Holzl, G., Bernaschek, G., and Hengstschlager, M. (1998) Oncogene 16, 2197–2204), and tumor suppression (Crino, P. B., and Henske, E. P. (1999) Neurology 53, 1384–1390). Here we report a critical role for tuberin in late stage myeloid cell differentiation. Tuberin strongly augments transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signal transduction pathways, including SMAD activation. We also demonstrate that the amino-terminal region of tuberin interacts specifically with the MH2 domain of SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins to regulate TGF-β1-responsive genes such as p21CIP. Inhibition of tuberin expression by Tsc2 antisense greatly reduces the ability of TGF-β to transcriptionally regulate p21CIP, p27KIP, and cyclin A leading to an abrogation of the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β1. Also, inhibition of tuberin expression during stimulation of monocytic differentiation with vitamin D3 and TGF-β1 significantly impaired myeloid cell growth inhibition and differentiation. Together, the data demonstrate the presence of a novel activation process following TGF-β1 stimulation that requires tuberin-dependent activity. Tuberin (TSC2) is a tumor suppressor gene. At the cellular level, tuberin is required as a critical regulator of cell growth, neuronal differentiation (Soucek, T., Holzl, G., Bernaschek, G., and Hengstschlager, M. (1998) Oncogene 16, 2197–2204), and tumor suppression (Crino, P. B., and Henske, E. P. (1999) Neurology 53, 1384–1390).

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1The abbreviations used are: TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; TGF, transforming growth factor; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotides; aODN, antisense ODN; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CDKs, cyclin-dependent kinase; cODN, control ODN. plays a fundamental role in the autosomal dominant syndrome of tuberous sclerosis. The syndrome is a multiorgan disease of benign tumors (i.e. hamartomas) and malformations affecting mesodermal and ectodermal tissue (5Murthy V. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Haddad L.A. Roy J.E. Cutone A.N. Beauchamp R.L. Smith N. Louis D.N. Ramesh V. Acta Neuropathol. 2001; 101: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The protein products of the two TSC genes, hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), are widely distributed in the brain, kidney, heart, and many other organs. Structurally, tuberin contains 1784 amino acids (6Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) with a 58-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region with homology to the catalytic domains of the Rap1 GTPase-activating protein and Rab5 GT-Pase-activating proteins (6Wienecke R.

Moreover, two potential transactivating domains (AD1 and AD2) were identified in the protein (8Tuschiya H. Orimoto K. Kobayashi K. Hino O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 429-433PubMed Google Scholar), and tuberin has been shown to associate with members of the steroid receptor superfamily and modulate transcriptional events (9Henry K.W. Yuan X.

Tuberin is known to play a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 boundary (1Soucek T. Pusch O. Wienecke R. DeClue J.E. Hengstschlager M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29301-29308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of tuberin expression leads to a faster transition through the G1/S phase and an inability of cells to arrest in the G0 phase or in response to mitogen depletion (10Hengstschlager M. Rodman D.M. Miloloza A. Hengstschlager-Ottnad E. Rosner M. Kubista M. Mutat. Res. 2002; 488: 233-239Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Tuberin also plays important functions in cell differentiation and development. For example, loss of tuberin expression has been shown to be sufficient to block neuronal differentiation (2Soucek T. Holzl G. Bernaschek G. Hengstschlager M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The TGF-β family of tumor suppressors is also critical for regulation of cell growth and differentiation of many cell types (11Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the signal transduction pathway of these tumor suppressor proteins results in uncontrolled cellular proliferation (11Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar, 12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cell cycle progression in late G1 by TGF-β1 is dependent on SMAD proteins, intracellular mediators of TGF-β1 signal transduction (13Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 102-111Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar). By working through SMAD proteins, TGF-β1 regulates transcriptional events including activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, which inhibit or down-regulate CDKs and/or cyclins involved in the control of the phosphorylated state of the retinoblastoma protein to prevent transition to the S phase (13Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 102-111Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Tuberin and the intracellular mediators of TGF-β1 signals have similar functions. As tumor suppressor genes, they encode proteins that suppress tumors by inhibiting the cell proliferation of epithelial, neural, and hematopoietic cells (1Soucek T. Pusch O. Wienecke R. DeClue J.E.

Like the mediators of TGF-β1, a functional loss of tuberin leads to pathologic outcomes being associated, at least in part, with the inactivation of the CDK inhibitor p27KIP (15Soucek T. Yeung R.S. Hengstschlager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15653-15658Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize that the mechanism of the negative growth regulation by tuberin might overlap with the mechanism of negative growth regulation by TGF-β1. Cells and Plasmids—HL-60 and the interleukin-3-dependent TF-1 cells, human myeloid leukemic cells, were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. HEK293 and CCL64 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. TSC2 mutant rodent cells LEF4A-/- pZ110-4-/-, pZ118-6+/-, pZZ119-6-/-, and pZ157-4+/- were gifts from Hiroki Onda (Harvard Medical School, Boston). Daniel Noonan (University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington) provided TSC2 expression vectors (9Henry K.W. Yuan X. Koszewski N.J. Onda H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Noonan D.J. J. Biol.

The cyclin A-luciferase reporter was provided by Rik Derynck (University of California, San Francisco). All GAL4-SMAD fusion plasmids were constructed by inserting the appropriate SMAD DNA fragments in-frame to the GAL4-(1–147) sequences in the vector pSG424 (23Sadowski I. Triszenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). In Vitro Production of TSC2 Deletion Proteins—Tuberin full-length, tuberin N (amino acids 1–440), tuberin ND (amino acids 673–1810), tuberin CD (amino acids 1–1124), and tuberin C (amino acids 1467–1810) were constructed for in vitro transcription and translation. 5′ and 3′ oligomers that have restriction sites NcoI and SpeI for tuberin, NcoI and SmaI for tuberin CD (amino acids 1–1124), and NcoI and XhoI for tuberin ND (amino acids 673–1810) were made and subcloned into the pTM1 vector. In vitro transcription and translation (TnT) of TSC2 deletions were done according to the protocol of rabbit reticulocyte lysate TnT systems (Promega, Madison, WI). Easytag [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to label proteins. A series of pTMTSC2 deletion plasmids were used as templates. Expression of GST Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Binding Assay— Full-length and partial deletions of Smad2 and Smad3 were synthesized by PCR and subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of plasmid pGEX-4T-1. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). TSC2 lysates were incubated with agarose beads, which have GST and GST fusion proteins, in 150 μl of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were washed six times in the above buffer with 250 mm NaCl, 400 mm KCl added. In vitro translated 35S-labeled tuberin products containing the indicated peptides were incubated with the indicated GST, followed by purification on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Samples were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to film. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—100 μl of crude extract obtained from TF1, pZ110-4-/-, pZ118-6+/-, pZZ119-6-/-, and pZ157-4+/- cells was rocked with the appropriate antibodies against tuberin and SMADs2/3 overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using Dynabeads according to the manufacturer (Dynal, New York). Samples were incubated with beads coupled with monoclonal FLAG antibody (Sigma) or polyclonal tuberin antibody (anti-tuberin antibody, C-20 polyclonal antibody, anti-tuberin antibody, N-19 polyclonal antibody, anti-cyclin A monoclonal antibody, and anti-p27KIP monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; anti-p21CIP monoclonal antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) for 4 h with horizontal rotation at 4 °C. Beads were washed at least five times and resuspended in SDS loading buffer. Immune complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by immunoblotting (24Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Ruscetti F.W. Kasper J.J. Bertolette D. Yoo Y.D.

Polyclonal anti-SMAD2 and -SMAD3 antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (polyclonal antibody, San Francisco, CA). Densitometry studies were carried out by following the Un-Scan-IT graph digitizing software instructions. Transient Transfection Assays—Transient transfections with 2 μg of Tsc2 cDNA or Tsc2 mutants were performed with the indicated cells grown at 50–70% confluence in 60-mm plates. The transfected cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. All transfections used the Fu-GENE 6 Transfection Reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics) with a ratio of DNA to FuGENE 6 of 1 mg of DNA to 3 ml of reagent. Transfections lacking the vectors of interest contained an equal amount of the “empty” expression vector. After overnight incubation, the cells (or transfected cells) were treated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 as indicated. The cells were then analyzed for luciferase activity. β-Galactosidase activity and protein determination were used to correct for transfection efficiencies. SB-43154224 (25Laping N.J. Grygielko E. Mathur A. Butter S. Bomberger J. Tweed C. Martin W. Fornwald J. Lehr R. Harling J. Gaster L. Callahan J.F. Olson B.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), a selective inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor signaling (Tochris, Ellisville, MO), was used in some assays. Antisense Treatment—The TSC2 antisense ODN (aODN, 5′-ATCTTAAACTTCTCCTTCAA-3′) was designed from the initiation codon (GenBank™ accession number NM000548). An equal length of control ODN (cODN, 5′-AACAAGTACACACAGCAGAC-3′) included nucleotides randomly organized. Cells were cultured for 24 h after transfection with the indicated expression vectors. Then cells were treated with 15 μm control or aODN for 2 h in the absence of serum, followed by treatment with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) and/or vitamin D3 (100 ng/ml) in 5% serum (26Cao Z. Flanders K.C.

After 24 h of additional incubation, cells were collected for the appropriate reading assay. For luciferase assays cells were collected and lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured with dual luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to the appropriate control vector. For differentiation studies into monocytes, HL-60 cells were incubated a total of 72 h, and the cells were identified by staining for the presence of α-naphthyl acetate esterase as indicated by the manufacturer (Sigma). For cell cycle analysis, pelleted and washed cells were treated with 70% ethanol overnight. Following alcohol removal, cells were treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with propidium iodide for 1 h. Cells were then analyzed for propidium iodide fluorescence using a FACscan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using CellFit software (BD Biosciences). Apoptosis of the cells was determined by labeling the cells with annexin V-FITC, and fluorescence was monitored by using flow cytometry. Confocal Microscopy—Cells under study were transfected with the appropriate expression vectors (TSC2, FLAG-tagged Smad3, and TGF-β receptor I) and incubated overnight. Depending on the type of experiment, the cells were then incubated in the presence of the control and aODNs for 2 h in the absence of serum. TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) and 5% serum were added to the cells followed by overnight incubation. The next day, the cells were first washed in PBS, pH 7.4, fixed with formalin (Sigma), blocked with normal goat serum, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody against the indicated protein (tuberin, SMADs2/3, and p27KIP). Slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated horse antimouse IgG (1:75) and/or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:100, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). DAPI (Sigma) DNA staining was used to monitor the nuclear organization. The double-immunolabeled slides were mounted under glass coverslips with GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). All slides were processed at once to maintain the same experimental conditions. The immunofluorescent labeling was done at least twice to assess the reproducibility of results. The confocal images were made using a Zeiss 310 confocal microscope with a HeNe laser with 543 nm excitation for rhodamine, argon laser with 488 nm excitation for FITC, and a coherent UV laser with 364 nm excitation for DAPI. The images and stored parameter files for intensity, pinhole aperture, contrast, and attenuation, etc. were held constant and identical for all images. Files were stored on a disk and printed using a Hewlett-Packard laser jet 4500 printer. The primary antibodies were tagged with anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Co-localization of red and green produces orange-yellow, and red, green, and blue combine to produce a pale yellow. Tuberin and SMAD Expression in Tuberin(-/-) and Tuberin(+/+) Cell Lines—The structures of tuberin and SMAD2 proteins along with some of their known domains are shown in Fig. 1A. By using antibodies specific for the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal domains of tuberin, we observed a protein band around 220 kDa in extracts from the TSC2-positive 293T, pZ118-6+/-, pZ157-4+/-, TF1, and TF1 subcloned (TF1s) cell lines (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–8), with the highest levels of expression occurring in the 293T, TF1, and TF1s. As expected, tuberin was not detected in the TSC2-negative LEF4A, pZ110-4-/-, and pZ119-6-/- cell lines, and TGF-β1 was not able to inhibit the proliferation of these lines (data not shown). The levels of tuberin expression in the promyelocytic HL-60 cells have been found to be very low or undetectable (6Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Tuberin expression, however, was observed in HL-60 cells treated with TGF-β1, with an ∼10-fold increase in protein following a 15-min treatment (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2), and specific anti-TGF-β1 antibodies blocked the TGF-β1-mediated increase in tuberin expression (Fig. 1C, lane 3). We detected expression of SMAD2 in all the cell lines studied, albeit at low level in 293T and pZ157-4+/- (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–8). Exogenous Tuberin Expression Induces TGF-β1-regulated Transcription—3TP-Lux is a reporter construct containing the TGF-β1-responsive elements from the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and collagenase I genes controlling the expression of luciferase (27Derynck R. Zhang L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1226-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Expression from 3TP-Lux was activated by TGF-β1 through SMAD proteins and the AP-1 transcription factor (27Derynck R. Zhang L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1226-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 stimulation of HEK293 cells co-transfected with 3TP-Lux and Tsc2 cDNA increased the luciferase activity by 6.4-fold when compared with TGF-β1 alone and 30-fold over the TSC2 transfectant alone (Fig. 2A). In the IL-3-dependent human myeloid cell line TF-1, transient expression of TSC2 followed by TGF-β1 stimulation increased the luciferase activity by 2.5-fold when compared with TGF-β1 alone and 140-fold over the TSC2 transfectant alone (Fig. 2B). To ascertain whether TSC2 activity was dependent on SMAD proteins alone, the SMAD-dependent and AP-1-independent reporter construct (p6SBE-Lux) was studied (22Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S. Cell. 2002; 1: 611-617Google Scholar). By using TF-1 cells with the p6-SBE-Lux reporter, transient expression of TSC2 followed by TGF-β1 stimulation increased the luciferase activity by 5-fold when compared with TGF-β1 alone and 1.8-fold over the TSC2 transfectant alone (Fig. 2C). Tuberin expression enhanced the ligand-induced transactivation function of the SMAD-driven p6SBE-Lux promoter. In TF-1 cells, exogenous tuberin expression was able to increase TGF-β1-dependent activation of the GAL4-SMAD2 (50-fold compared with 5.4-fold for TGF-β1 alone) or GAL4-SMAD3 (78-fold compared with 3.7-fold) directed reporter pG5E1b-Lux (Fig. 2D). Thus, the effect of tuberin and TGF-β1 work in concert to stimulate significantly higher levels of promoter activity than either alone or their additive effects. Evidence for a functional role for tuberin in TGF-β1 signal transduction was demonstrated by using antisense technology. In HEK293 cells treated with antisense phosphorothiolate oligodeoxynucleotides to Tsc2, a marked reduction in the level of tuberin was observed (Fig. 2E, lanes 1 and 3). Most interesting, TGF-β1 had a stimulatory effect on tuberin expression, and this effect was also blocked by aODN to Tsc2 (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 4). Similar results were obtained with HL-60 cells (data not shown). When HEK293 cells were transfected with SMAD3 and pG5E1b-Lux reporter constructs and treated with TGF-β1, aODN to Tsc2 inhibited TGF-β1-dependent activity of the reporter gene construct by 67% in cells expressing GAL4-SMAD3 relative to cells treated with cODN (Fig. 2F). These results establish that tuberin enhances the SMAD-dependent transactivation functions of TGF-β1. Tuberin Physically Interacts with the SMAD Proteins in Vivo—Next we showed a physical association between tuberin and the SMADs (Fig. 3). The effect of TGF-β1 on the levels of tuberin and SMADs2/3 complexes was examined in a time-dependent manner. CCL64 cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins were examined for an association between SMADs2/3 and tuberin from 0 to 120 min following TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 3, A and B). These interactions were detected by using anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3A) and anti-tuberin antibodies (Fig. 3B) followed by Western blotting. Whereas an association between SMADs2/3 and tuberin was detectable at time 0, TGF-β1 stimulation of these complexes increased in 3 min, reached a plateau by 30 min, and remained elevated after 120 min. No bands were observed when control antibodies were used (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 6). As additional controls, the same experiments were performed using the pZ157-4 TSC2(+/+) and pZ119-4 TSC2(-/-) cells. SMADs2/3 proteins were found associated with tuberin in the pZ157-4 TSC2(+/+) cell line (Fig. 3C) but not in pZ119-4 TSC2(-/-) cell line (Fig. 3D). Thus, TGF-β1 stimulates the association of SMAD proteins with tuberin. The few complexes observed in the absence of TGF-β1 could represent either TGF-β-independent association or the results of endogenous TGF-β activity. Amino-terminal Region of Tuberin Interacts with the MH2 Region of the SMADs2/3—We next mapped the protein domains mediating the interaction between tuberin and SMADs2/3. A diagrammatic representation of the tuberin mutants used in these studies is shown in Fig. 4A. The aminoterminal 1322 amino acids of tuberin were sufficient for interaction with GST-SMAD2 (Fig. 4B, N), whereas no interaction could be detected by using either the carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 4B, C and NΔ) or the middle region of tuberin (Fig. 4B, M). Identical results were obtained with a GST-SMAD3 fusion protein (data not shown). To map the domains within the SMAD proteins interacting with tuberin, HEK293 were transfected with various mutants of Smad3 (Fig. 4C) and Tsc2. Lysates from these cells were then immunoprecipitated followed by Western blotting. FLAG-tagged SMAD3 lacking the MH2 domain did not interact with tuberin (Fig. 4D, upper panel), whereas SMAD3 containing the MH2 domain formed complexes with tuberin. The expression levels of tuberin and SMAD3 mutants were monitored by immunoblotting (Fig. 4D, bottom panels). SMADs2/3 proteins share two conserved functional domains termed the MH homology domains as follows: the amino-terminal MH-1 domain, and the carboxyl-terminal MH-2 domain attached by a linker region (27Derynck R. Zhang L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1226-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Tuberin similarly bound to SMAD2 through the MH2 region but not through SMAD2 MH1 or MH1 + linker regions (data not shown). Thus, the amino-terminal domain of tuberin physically associates with the MH2 region of SMADs2/3. TGF-β1 Stimulates Co-localization of Tuberin and SMAD Protein Complexes from the Cytoplasm to the Nucleus of Myeloid Cells—Given that tuberin physically associates with SMADs2/3, we next studied the intracellular trafficking of tuberin following TGF-β1 treatment because SMAD proteins are known to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following TGF-β1 treatment. Confocal microscopy of immunostained CCL64 cells revealed that endogenous SMAD2 and tuberin were co-localized in the cytoplasm of serum-deprived CCL64 cells (Fig. 5A, top panels). When the CCL64 cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 30 min, tuberin and SMAD2 proteins were found co-localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, bottom panels). Similar results were seen with endogenous SMAD3 (data not shown). Even in the case of SMAD3 and tuberin overexpression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5B, top panels), there is little or no nuclear co-localization of the proteins until TGF-β1 was added to the cells (Fig. 5B, bottom panels). Additional experiments using antibodies against specific domains of the SMAD2 or SMAD3 proteins, in other cell lines, confirmed the association of endogenous SMADs with the tuberin protein (data not shown). Tuberin Mutants Lacking the SMAD Binding Domain Fail to Enhance TGF-β1-directed Transactivation—Because the ability of TGF-β1 to stimulate SMADs2/3-dependent transactivation is increased by tuberin, we determined the ability of tuberin mutants lacking the SMAD binding domain to stimulate TGF-β1-directed promoter activity. CCL64 cells were co-transfected with Gal4-Smad3, G5E1b-luciferase reporter, and TSC2 mutants (Fig. 6A) and incubated overnight with and without TGF-β1. The tuberin mutant lacking the MH2 binding domain had 73% less promoter activity (Fig. 6B, lane 8 compared with lane 4), whereas the mutant containing the MH2 binding domain retained full activity. These results indicate that tuberin stimulation of TGF-β1-dependent promoter activity requires binding to the SMAD protein. Involvement of Tuberin in TGF-β1 Regulation of Cell Cycle Genes—Previous studies have shown that TGF-β1 exerts antiproliferative effects by regulating the transcriptional activity of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes such as cyclin A, p21CIP, and p27KIP. TGF-β1 increased the expression of these CDK inhibitors in epithelial (28Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TF-1 myeloid cells were transfected with p21CIP promoter luciferase constructs and treated the next day with control or aODNs to Tsc2 (Fig. 7, A and B) followed by treatment with TGF-β1 for 24 h. Treatment of TF-1 cells with the aODN to Tsc2, but not control ODN, blocked the ability of TGF-β1 to stimulate p21CIP promoter activity (Fig. 7A). SB-431542 (25Laping N.J. Grygielko E. Mathur A.

Two highly homologous polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV, which belong to the sialyltransferase gene family, synthesize polysialic acid on NCAM. By contrast, ST8Sia III, which is moderately homologous to ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV, adds oligosialic acid to itself but very inefficiently to NCAM. Here, we report domains of polysialyltransferases required for NCAM recognition and polysialylation by generating chimeric enzymes between ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia III or ST8Sia II. We first determined the catalytic domain of ST8Sia IV by deletion mutants. To identify domains responsible for NCAM polysialylation, different segments of the ST8Sia IV catalytic domain, identified by the deletion experiments, were replaced with corresponding segments of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia III. We found that larger polysialic acid was formed on the enzymes themselves (autopolysialylation) when chimeric enzymes contained the carboxyl-terminal region of ST8Sia IV. However, chimeric enzymes that contain only the carboxyl-terminal segment of ST8Sia IV and the amino-terminal segment of ST8Sia III showed very weak activity toward NCAM, even though they had strong activity in polysialylating themselves. In fact, chimeric enzymes containing the amino-terminal portion of ST8Sia IV fused to downstream sequences of ST8Sia III inhibited NCAM polysialylation in vitro, although they did not polysialylate NCAM. These results suggest that in polysialyltransferases the NCAM recognition domain is distinct from the polysialylation domain and that some chimeric enzymes may act as a dominant negative enzyme for NCAM polysialylation.

Based on phenotypes observed in NCAM-deficient mice, polysialylated NCAM is likely involved in various neural functions such as axon pathfinding, circadian rhythm, and memory formation through neuronal plasticity and is also important for olfactory bulb formation (12Cremer H.

These enzymes catalyze transfer of multiple α2,8-linked sialic acid residues to a precursor containing a NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R structure without participation of other enzymes (19Nakayama J.

The presence of polysialic acid is always associated with expression of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV (23Hildebrandt H. Becker C. Murau M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Rahmann H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Ong E. Nakayama J. Angata K. Reyes L. Katsuyama T. Arai Y. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similar to phenotypes observed in NCAM-deficient mice, disruption of ST8Sia IV in mice leads to impaired long-term potentiation and long-term depression in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of the adult hippocampus (25Eckhardt M.

Loss of polysialic acid in ST8Sia IV-null mice is incomplete, presumably because ST8Sia II compensates for loss of ST8Sia IV. These results suggest that ST8Sia IV and S8Sia II are the key enzymes controlling expression of polysialic acid. Importantly, it has been reported that aberrant expression of polysialylated NCAM correlates with some disease states. Expression of polysialic acid is often associated with tumor metastasis in both small cell and non-small cell lung carcinomas (26Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Investig. 1994; 70: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tanaka F. Otake Y. Nakagawa T. Kawano Y. Miyahara R. Li M. Yanagihara K. Nakayama J. Fujimoto I. Ikenaka K. Wada H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3072-3080PubMed Google Scholar). Polysialic acid is also detected in neuroblastomas and in Wilms' tumor (28Hildebrandt H. Becker C. Glüer S. Rösner H. Gerardy-Schahn R. Rahmann H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 779-784PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jimbo T. Nakayama J. Akahane K. Fukuda M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Roth J.

In addition, capsules of certain pathogenic bacteria that cause meningitis bear polysialic acid, suggesting that polysialic acid leads to immune tolerance by facilitating escape from attack by the immune system in vivo (31Robbins J.B.

Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In order to both develop therapeutic agents to treat these diseases and understand the roles of polysialic acid in neural development, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms of polysialic acid synthesis. Polysialyltransferases belong to the vertebrate sialyltransferase gene family, including α2,3-, α2,6-, and α2,8-sialyltransferases. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of various sialyltransferases shows two regions of weak but discernible homology in their catalytic domains, designated sialylmotifs L and S (33Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that sialylmotif L is involved in binding to the donor substrate, CMP-NeuNAc, whereas sialylmotif S participates in binding to both donor and acceptor substrates (34Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 35Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond structures of ST8Sia IV determined by mass spectrometric analysis indicate that its carboxyl-terminal region is close to the center of the catalytic domain through a unique disulfide bond that is not formed in other α2,3- and α2,6-sialyltransferases (36Angata K. Yen T.-Y. El-Battari A. Macher B.A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15369-15377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Of six α2,8-sialyltransferases, ST8Sia II, ST8Sia IV, and ST8Sia III, which is moderately homologous to ST8Sia II and IV, can polysialylate themselves (autopolysialylation) (22Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4484-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The length of polysialic acid made in vitro by these three enzymes is, however, substantially different in that ST8Sia II and IV form larger polymers of sialic acids than does ST8Sia III, and only ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV can add polysialic acid to NCAM (22Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis for these differences is not yet known. It was reasonable to hypothesize that differences in acceptor specificity could allow us to identify protein domains responsible for synthesis of long polysialic acid and/or recognition of NCAM by swapping various domains because the gross structures of ST8Sia II, ST8Sia III, and ST8Sia IV are similar to each other (2Angata K. Fukuda M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To identify domains responsible for NCAM polysialylation, first we used deletion analysis to determine the catalytic domain of ST8Sia IV. Then, the catalytic domain of ST8Sia IV was divided into seven different domains based on homology of ST8Sia II, III, and IV (Fig. 1). These domains of ST8Sia IV were swapped with corresponding segments of ST8Sia II or III. The enzymatic activity of the resulting chimeric proteins was measured by determining polysialic acid synthesis in transfected cells and assaying autopolysialylation and NCAM polysialylation in vitro. We found that the carboxyl-terminal region determines the length of polysialic acid and that the amino-terminal region of the catalytic domain is required for NCAM recognition, indicating that different domains underlie these two functions. Plasmid DNAs—cDNAs encoding ST8Sia II, ST8Sia III, and ST8Sia IV (pcDNAI-ST8Sia II, pcDNAI-ST8Sia III, and pcDNAI-ST8Sia IV, respectively) were prepared and used as described previously (16Nakayama J.

The soluble forms of each enzyme fused to a signal peptide and IgG binding domain of protein A (pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia II, pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia III, and pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV) were also described previously (19Nakayama J.

The modified pIG-NCAM·IgG encoding a soluble NCAM lacking the VASE and muscle-specific domain, which was fused with hinge and constant regions of human IgG in pIG vector (40Simmons D.L. Hartly D. Cellular Interactions in Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1993: 93-127Google Scholar), was generated as described previously (22Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Deletion Mutants of Soluble ST8Sia IV—To construct deletion mutants from the amino-terminal region of ST8Sia IV, pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV was used as a template for PCR by Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using SP6 primer and the following primers: PST-50, 5′-CGGGATCCCAATAGCTCTGATAAAATCATT-3′ (147-168); PST-62, 5′-GAGGATCCTTCAATCTTCCAGCACAATGTA-3′ (183-204); PST-72, 5′-CGGGATCCGAAAATCAATTCCTCTTTGGTC-3′ (213-234); PST-82, 5′-GAGGATCCAAGGAAGAACATACTTCGTTTC-3′ (243-264); PST-103, 5′-GAGGATCCTAAGCCTGGTGATGTCATACAC-3′ (306-327); and PST-127, 5′-GAGGATCCCCTCCTACCTGAAGTTTCACCA-3′ (378-399); BamHI sites are underlined. The initiation methionine is coded by nucleotides 1-3. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene) and sequenced to select proper clones. The cDNAs digested with BamHI and XbaI replaced wild-type sequences of pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV. Construction of Chimeric Forms of ST8Sia IV and II or III—To swap sequences, we utilized PCR-based methods using human ST8Sia II, III, and IV cDNA as a template. For ST8Sia IV, an upstream primer (designated IV-N′) includes the first methionine and a HindIII site, and a downstream primer (designated IV-C′) contains the terminal codon and an XbaI site. Similarly, primers II-N′ and III-N′ for ST8Sia II and III contain a HindIII site upstream of the initiation methionine codon, and 3′ primers, II-C′ and III-C′, contain an XhoI site after the termination codons. To divide the genes into seven domains (A-G), regions exhibiting that sequences are highly homologous among the three enzymes were chosen (see Fig. 1). A BsaI site was incorporated into each internal primer so that the end of amplified fragments after digestion with BsaI would share sequences in both directions and in different genes. For example, to obtain IVCDII, an ST8Sia IV cDNA fragment containing regions A-C and an ST8Sia II cDNA fragment containing regions D-G were amplified by PCR. For amplification of A-C domains of ST8Sia IV, a primer IV-N′ and a primer IVDC containing the TGAG sequence within the BsaI restriction site (underline indicates the antisense sequence of Ser193) were used. cDNA encoding regions D to the stop codon of ST8Sia II was amplified using primers II-C′ and IICD with CTCA within the BsaI site (Ser208 of ST8Sia II is underlined). The amplified fragments were cloned into pBluescript II and sequenced to select the proper clone. The HindIII- and BsaI-digested ST8Sia IV fragment and the XhoI- and BsaI-digested ST8Sia II fragment were ligated and sub-cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNAI (Invitrogen), resulting in a membrane form of IVCDII, pcDNAI-IVCDII. To construct pcDNAI-IIIEFIVFGIII, a chimeric cDNA fragment was amplified by primers IVEF and III-C′ from pcDNAI-IVFGIII. The resultant cDNA was ligated with an ST8Sia III fragment containing regions A-E into pcDNAI at the common site generated by BsaI digestion. Construction of Soluble Forms of Chimeric cDNAs—The cDNA in pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV was replaced with chimeric cDNAs derived from ST8Sia IV using common restriction sites, either BstBI or NarI. Similarly, cDNAs of ST8Sia II and III were replaced with chimeric cDNAs using either the EcoRI or BamHI site in the pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia II sequence and either the XbaI or XmnI in the ST8Sia III sequence. To generate a mutant at the third N-glycosylation site (Asn206) of ST8Sia III in IVBCIIICDIV, the following primer sets were used for PCR reaction: T7 primer and III-N3-PML, 5′-GGCACGTGTTTCTTCCAACATCTCTTTGG-3′ (591-611; the PmlI site is underlined); III-N3-MSC, 5′-GATGGCCAACTTACCACCTTCAACCCC-3′ (619-636; the MscI site is underlined, and the mutated site is in bold); and the SP6 primer. After cloning into pBluescript II, DNA fragments were excised by NarI and PmlI or MscI and XbaI. The purified fragments replaced the NarI-XbaI fragment of pcDNAI-A·IVBCIIICDIV, resulting in pcDNAI-A·IVBCIIICDIV-N. Expression of Polysialic Acid on Cells Transfected with Chimeric cDNAs—The chimeric cDNAs encoding membrane or soluble forms of chimeric enzymes were transfected into COS-1, HeLa, and Chinese hamster ovary cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) as described previously (36Angata K. Yen T.-Y. El-Battari A. Macher B.A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15369-15377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with 12F8 (BD Biosciences), a rat monoclonal antibody specific to polysialic acid (41Chung W.W. Lagenaur C.F. Yan Y.M. Lund J.S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 314: 290-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody specific to rat IgM (Cappel). Preparation of Enzymes and NCAM·IgG Chimera Proteins—The cDNAs encoding protein A fused with ST8Sia II, ST8Sia III, ST8Sia IV, truncated forms of ST8Sia IV, or chimeric enzymes were transfected into COS-1 cells, and soluble protein A fusion enzymes were purified from spent serum-free media with human IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (21Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A 50% suspension of enzyme-adsorbed IgG-Sepharose in the serum-free medium was used as an enzyme source. The amount of the enzymes was estimated by densitometric analysis after Western blotting using peroxidase-conjugated rabbit immunoglobulins (Cappel) and an ECL PLUS kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (21Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly, the fusion protein NCAM·IgG purified from cultured medium by protein A beads (Pierce) was subjected to Western blotting analysis to measure the quantity and quality of NCAM·IgG using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Cappel) as described previously (21Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In Vitro Polysialyltransferase Assays—An equivalent amount of each chimeric enzyme was used for in vitro sialyltransferase assays. For autopolysialylation assays, the enzyme-adsorbed beads were incubated in 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton CF-54, and 2.4 nmol (0.7 μCi) of CMP-[14C]NeuNAc for2hat37 °C. After incubation, the radiolabeled enzymes were released from beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography (22Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To measure polysialylation activity onto NCAM·IgG, 10 pmol of NCAM·IgG was added to the reaction mixture. After incubation, NCAM·IgG in the supernatant was obtained by brief centrifugation and subjected to fluorography. The degree of polymerization of sialic acid on ST8Sia III, ST8Sia IVDEIII, or ST8Sia IV was analyzed by HPLC using a Mono-Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) after [14C]NeuNAc-labeled N-glycans were released by PNGase F (Calbiochem) as described previously (21Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Determination of the Catalytic Domain of ST8Sia IV—Previously, we demonstrated that Cys356 at the carboxyl-terminal of ST8Sia IV is required for enzymatic activity and that only three amino acids can be removed from the catalytic domain of ST8Sia IV to maintain its activity (36Angata K. Yen T.-Y. El-Battari A. Macher B.A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15369-15377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the amino-terminal limit of ST8Sia IV catalytic activity, we generated protein A fusion proteins of truncated ST8Sia IV and assayed enzymatic activity in vitro. Removing 39, 49, and 61 amino acids from the amino-terminal (SF-IV-(40), SF-IV-(50), and SF-IV-(62), respectively) minimally affected NCAM polysialylation (Fig. 2). However, eliminating more than 61 amino acids from the amino-terminal (SF-IV-(72)) dramatically reduced both polysialylation of NCAM and autopolysialylation (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the catalytic domain of ST8Sia IV resides between amino acid residues 62 and 356. Accordingly, a soluble form of ST8Sia IV encoding residues 40-359 was assayed in the following experiments to ensure that the catalytic domain is fully accessible to NCAM·IgG. Functional Analysis of ST8Sia II/ST8Sia IV Chimeric Enzymes—Although ST8Sia II, III, and IV can all autopolysialylate, ST8Sia II and IV synthesize longer polysialic acid on NCAM than does ST8Sia III. ST8Sia IV exhibits 59% identity at the amino acid level with ST8Sia II but only 34.8% identity with ST8Sia III (22Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Harrplot analysis revealed that the two NCAM polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV, are highly homologous along the entire amino acid sequence except for the extreme amino-terminal region (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia III share significant homology only in sialylmotif L and S regions. Because ST8Sia III and ST8Sia IV differ in their efficiency in recognizing NCAM, these results suggest that regions exhibiting low homology are involved in NCAM (acceptor) recognition and/or polysialylation activity (Fig. 1). Because all three enzymes conserve similar structural elements such as size, Cys residues involved in disulfide bridges, and N-glycosylation sites (2Angata K. Fukuda M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), we assumed that swapping domains among them was a reasonable strategy to determine functional domains. To construct a chimeric polysialyltransferase, the domains of ST8Sia IV were replaced with corresponding domains of ST8Sia II. In our nomenclature, IICDIV corresponds to the chimeric protein containing A, B, and C domains of ST8Sia II and D, E, F, and G domains of ST8Sia IV. In these constructs, almost all chimeric proteins (IIABIV to IIEFIV) displayed high NCAM polysialylation activity (Fig. 3), demonstrating that chimeric enzymes are functional. Interestingly, IIBCIV, IICDIV and IIDEIV, in which the carboxyl-terminal region consists of ST8Sia IV domains, showed higher polysialylation activity than ST8Sia II or ST8Sia IV (Fig. 3). The chimeric enzymes IIABIV, IIBCIV, and IICDIV, produced in COS-1 cells, showed an increased amount of a higher molecular mass band upon Western blot analysis, whereas the same band was less for ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV. These second bands represent polysialylated enzymes as reported for autopolysialylation in vivo (38Close B.E. Tao K. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4484-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The results on Western blot analysis are consistent with the findings that IIBCIV and IICDIV formed NCAM·IgG with much higher molecular masses (Fig. 3, middle panel). Unlike the chimeric enzymes described above, replacement of the G domain of ST8Sia II with the corresponding domain of ST8Sia IV (IIFGIV) resulted in decreased NCAM polysialylation activity (Fig. 3). This activity was restored when the F domain of ST8Sia IV was included in the ST8Sia II sequence (IIEFIVFGII), indicating that F or F and G domains contain the minimal requirement for efficient polysialylation in these chimeric enzymes. It is possible that the ST8Sia II G domain makes more stabilized intramolecular interactions with ST8Sia II sequences in the rest of molecule and that the ST8Sia IV G domain makes weaker intramolecular connections with ST8Sia II sequences. Efficient Polysialylation Requires the Carboxyl-terminal Region of ST8Sia IV—To determine the roles of different domains in polysialylation, ST8Sia IV sequences were replaced with corresponding sequences of ST8Sia III, as shown in Fig. 4. In this series of the constructs, the ST8Sia III sequence can replace the ST8Sia IV A sequence, which contains a stem region, for autopolysialylation. Replacement of A-DorA-E regions of ST8Sia IV with the corresponding sequence of ST8Sia III, IIIDEIV, or IIIEFIV did not interfere with autopolysialylation activity (Fig. 4A). By contrast, IIIBCIV and IIICDIV exhibited reduced autopolysialylation activity. These chimeric enzymes were produced in amounts equivalent to those for other chimeric enzymes, indicating that gross conformational change did not take place in these chimeric enzymes. The results also suggest that fusing AB or ABC domains of ST8Sia III to ST8Sia IV (IIIBCIV and IIICDIV) did not lead to a proper conformation of domains including these regions, whereas the chimeric enzyme containing the ABCD domains of ST8Sia III (IIIDEIV) was highly active (Fig. 4A). In the following experiments, we performed experiments using the chimeric enzymes that showed activity for autopolysialylation to interpret the results because those active enzymes are judged to have no gross structural alteration that affects polysialylation activity. The above-mentioned results also indicate that the carboxyl-terminal half of ST8Sia IV is required for efficient polysialylation because the autopolysialylation products of IIIDEIV and IIIEFIV were larg"
https://openalex.org/W2094743769,"The p53-inducible gene 3 (PIG3) is a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and is thought to play a role in apoptosis. In this report, we identify a novel alternatively spliced product from the PIG3 gene that we call PIG3AS (PIG3 alternative splice). PIG3AS results from alternative pre-mRNA splicing that skips exon 4 of the five exons included in the PIG3 transcript. The resulting protein product shares its first 206 amino acids with PIG3 but has a unique 42-amino acid C terminus. In unstressed cells and after most DNA damage conditions that induce transcription from the PIG3 gene, production of the PIG3 transcript dominates. However, in response to UV light, pre-mRNA splicing shifts dramatically in favor of PIG3AS. Unlike the PIG3 protein, the PIG3AS protein is rapidly degraded with a short half-life and is stabilized by proteasome inhibition. Our results illustrate the first example of an endogenous, UV-inducible, alternative splicing event and that control of the splicing machinery is involved in the cellular DNA damage response. They also suggest that rapid proteolytic degradation represents a cellular mechanism for uncoupling p53 activity from PIG3 gene activation that is independent of promoter selectivity."

Streptokinase (SK) is a robust Pg activator in physiologic fluids in the absence of fibrin.

We show that the SK α domain binds avidly to the Pg kringle domains that maintain Glu-Pg in a tightly folded conformation. By virtue of deletion of SK residues 1–59, SKΔ59 loses the ability to unfold Glu-Pg during complex formation and becomes incapable of nonproteolytic active site formation. In this manner, SKΔ59 behaves more like staphylokinase than like SK; it requires plasmin to form a functional activator complex, and in this complex SKΔ59 does not protect plasmin from inhibition by α2-antiplasmin. At the same time, SKΔ59 is unlike staphylokinase or SK and is more like tissue Pg activator, because it is a poor activator of the tightly folded form of Glu-Pg in physiologic solutions. SKΔ59 can only activate Glu-Pg when it was unfolded by fibrin interactions or by Cl–-deficient buffers. Taken together, these studies indicate that an intact α domain confers on SK the ability to nonproteolytically activate Glu-Pg, to unfold and process Glu-Pg substrate in physiologic solutions, and to alter the substrate-inhibitor interactions of plasmin in the activator complex. The loss of an intact α domain makes SKΔ59 activate Pg through classical “fibrin-dependent mechanisms” (akin to both staphylokinase and tissue Pg activator) that include: 1) a marked preference for a fibrin-bound or unfolded Glu-Pg substrate, 2) a requirement for plasmin in the activator complex, and 3) the creation of an activator complex with plasmin that is readily inhibited by α2-antiplasmin. The mechanism of action of plasminogen (Pg) activators may affect their therapeutic properties in humans. Streptokinase (SK) is a robust Pg activator in physiologic fluids in the absence of fibrin.

https://openalex.org/W2077366253,"Apoptotic markers consist of either caspase substrate cleavage products or phenotypic changes that manifest themselves as a consequence of caspase-mediated substrate cleavage. We have shown recently that pharmacological inhibitors of caspase activity prevent the appearance of two such apoptotic manifestations, αII-spectrin cleavage and DNA fragmentation, but that blockade of the latter required a significantly higher concentration of inhibitor. We investigated this phenomenon through the use of a novel radiolabeled caspase inhibitor, [125I]M808, which acts as a caspase active site probe. [125I]M808 bound to active caspases irreversibly and with high sensitivity in apoptotic cell extracts, in tissue extracts from several commonly used animal models of cellular injury, and in living cells. Moreover, [125I]M808 detected active caspases in septic mice when injected intravenously. Using this caspase probe, an active site occupancy assay was developed and used to measure the fractional inhibition required to block apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation. In thymocytes, occupancy of up to 40% of caspase active sites had no effect on DNA fragmentation, whereas inhibition of half of the DNA cleaving activity required between 65 and 75% of active site occupancy. These results suggest that a high and persistent fractional inhibition will be required for successful caspase inhibition-based therapies.

The deliberate removal of excess or damaged cells is a universal feature of multicellular organisms and proceeds by a biochemical suicide program known as apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Hengartner M.O.

Signals that activate the apoptotic cascade include DNA damage, anoxia, lack of survival factors, and cytotoxic drugs. The downstream executioners of the apoptotic death pathway belong to a family of cysteine proteases termed caspases. Caspases exist as pro-enzymes that are activated by proximity-induced conformational change and autoprocessing, or by proteolytic processing by either an upstream activator caspase or the serine protease granzyme B (3Martin S.J.

The resulting heterotetramer consists of two large and two small subunits and cleaves a limited set of protein substrates with the loosely conserved recognition sequence X-Glu-X-Asp.

Because of the lethal consequences of unbridled caspase activity, several checkpoints both upstream and downstream of caspase activation ensure tight control over the apoptotic pathway (reviewed in Refs. 8Shi Y.

Ischemic diseases (stroke, myocardial infarction, renal ischemia, and organ transplantation), alcohol-induced hepatitis, sepsis, and Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, are conditions with demonstrated caspase-3 activation and where excessive caspase activity may contribute to the pathology (reviewed in Refs. 17Nicholson D.W.

Although the end point for compound efficacy is whether or not it will improve symptoms in preclinical animals models and in patients, an important aspect to drug development is to assess the percentage of target occupied by the drug, and to correlate this value with the occupancy required for effective treatment. In vivo occupancy studies for cell surface receptors have been mostly applied to anti-psychotic drugs and are performed by positron emission tomography and single photon emission-computed tomography (reviewed in Refs. 29Gibson R.E.

Des. 2000; 6: 1593-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For intracellular enzymes, no reports of whole cell active site occupancy by inhibitors have been published. Instead, surrogate markers of enzymatic activity are used to evaluate the potency of inhibitors. For caspases, direct and indirect markers, such as substrate cleavage, phosphatidylserine exposure, and DNA fragmentation have been used to follow apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Recently, however, we have shown that not all markers give the same indication of caspase activity (31Méthot N. Huang J. Coulombe N. Vaillancourt J.P. Rasper D. Tam J. Han Y. Colucci J. Zamboni R. Xanthoudakis S. Toulmond S. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 199: 199-207Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We speculated that the inhibition of some apoptotic manifestations require a greater percentage of caspase blockade than other markers. Here we characterized a radiolabeled, irreversible caspase inhibitor and established a methodology that enables the quantitation of active caspases in cells and the occupancy of their active sites by reversible, competitive caspase inhibitors. We compared caspase active site occupancy with DNA fragmentation, and demonstrate that inhibition of up to 40% of caspase activity has no effect on apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation, suggesting that a high fractional inhibition of caspases is required for inhibition of DNA cleavage. The caspase active site probe was able to detect active caspases in vivo, however, its uneven distribution precluded determination of caspase active site occupancy. We therefore devised an ex vivo method that estimates the percentage of caspase that must be blocked to inhibit DNA cleavage in vivo, and applied the methodology to the rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) 1The abbreviations used are: CLP, cecal ligation and perforation; Ac-DEVD-AMC, acyl-DEVD-aminomethyl coumarin; ICAD, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: CLP, cecal ligation and perforation; Ac-DEVD-AMC, acyl-DEVD-aminomethyl coumarin; ICAD, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. sepsis model. Caspase Active Site Probe—[125I]M808 was synthesized by the Medicinal Chemistry Department at Merck Frosst with a specific activity of 2000 Ci/mmol. Briefly, the synthesis was performed by peptidic coupling of commercially available (5-iodo-2-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid with l-valine t-butyl ester. Deprotection of the t-butyl ester with trifluoroacetic acid gave N-[(5-iodo-2-methoxyphenyl)acetyl]-l-valine, which was coupled with the known tert-butyl 3-amino-2,3,5-trideoxy-5-fluoropentonate (preparation described in Ref. 32Revesz L. Briswalter C. Heng R. Leutwiler A. Mueller R. Wuethrich H.-J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 9693-9696Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), to yield N1-(1-ethyl-3-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-N2-[(5-iodo-2-methoxyphenyl)acetyl]-l-valinamide as a mixture of four diastereomers. Conversion of the iodide functionality to 125I was accomplished through the intermediacy of an aryl tin species and the alcohol moiety was oxidized to the ketone via a tetrapropylammoniumperruthenate oxidation. Animals—Female Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g; Charles River) and ND4 mice (20–25 g, Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. All procedures were carried out under appropriate Animal Care Committee approval in strict accordance to Merck and Co. animal care policies. Cecal Ligation and Perforation—Animals were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane and body temperature was maintained by use of a thermoregulated heated blanket. A midline incision was made in the abdominal wall of the animal and the cecum exteriorized. The cecum was ligated with a nylon (4-0) suture proximal to the ileocecal valve. In mice, perforation of the cecum was done using a 23-gauge needle passed through the distal portion of the cecum. The abdominal wall was sutured with polydioxane suture (4-0) and the skin was sutured with surgical glue. Rat femoral vein cannulation and CLP surgeries were done sequentially. First, femoral vein cannulation was performed by a small incision in the inguinal region and isolation of the femoral vein. A Silicone catheter (0.02 “× 0.037,” Lomir) connected to a polyurethane catheter (PU-C30, 3 French, 80 cm, Instech Solomon) was inserted into the vena cava, exteriorized at the nape of the neck, and clamped for the duration of the surgery. Cannulation was immediately followed by cecal ligation and perforation, using a 20-gauge cannula (Abbott Ireland) passed through the distal portion of the exteriorized cecum. Braided silk (size 0) was threaded through the cannula and secured in place to allow leakage of the cecal content into the peritoneum. Sham-operated animals had the cecum exteriorized but no ligation or puncture of the cecum. The abdominal wall was sutured with polydioxane suture (4-0) and the skin was sutured with clips. Immediately after surgery, all animals received 1 ml of 0.9% saline administered by subcutaneous injection. In rats where compound was delivered continuously, a bolus of vehicle or compound (M867) was administered via the intravenous catheter, which was then connected to a Medfusion 2010i Syringe pump (Medex Inc.) at a delivery rate of 2 ml/h/kg for 24 h. Cell Culture—All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Jurkat cells (ATCC TIB-152) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptamycin). Rat thymocytes were cultured for 24 h at a density of 10 × 106 cells/ml in CytoSF4 media (Kempt Technologies) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and penicillin-streptamycin. NT2 cells (ATCC 3813555) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Apoptosis was induced by addition of campothecin (3 μg/ml) on serum-starved Jurkat cells suspended at a density of 1 million cells/ml in CytoSf4 media or by addition of camptothecin (5 μg/ml) added to the culture media of NT2 cells that had reached 60–80% confluence. Cultured rat thymocytes spontaneously initiated apoptosis under the culture conditions used. Typically, 30% of thymocytes exhibited subdiploid DNA content after 24 h of culture. Thymocyte Cell Suspensions—Single-cell thymocyte suspensions were obtained by grinding fresh thymi in 50-μm Medicon (Dako) and Medimachine (Dako) with 2 ml of ice-cold isolation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% fetal bovine serum), for 2 15-s pulse. The suspension was filtered through a 50-μm nylon mesh (BD Bioscience). Cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, suspended in 10 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (17 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NH4Cl), and incubated 10 min at room temperature. Thymocytes were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min, suspended in 5–10 ml of isolation buffer without fetal bovine serum, and counted with hemocytometer and trypan blue staining. Apoptosis Detection—DNA fragmentation was quantified by subdiploid DNA content, which was determined with flow cytometry. Briefly, 1.5 × 106 thymocytes or 5 × 105 Jurkat cells were fixed for 30 min on ice in 80% EtOH. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated on ice for 45 min. Pelleted cells were suspended in 500 μl of PI staining solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml RNase A (Roche), 25 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma)). Flow cytometry was performed with a FACS Calibur instrument (BD Bioscience) on 20,000 events per sample, each sample was prepared in duplicate. Very small cell debris was electronically gated out based on forward light scatter. A comparison of DNA fragmentation assessed by subdiploid DNA content and cytoplasmic nucleosomes has been performed elsewhere (31Méthot N. Huang J. Coulombe N. Vaillancourt J.P. Rasper D. Tam J.

Tissues, Cell Extracts, and Caspase Activity—All tissues were either frozen or processed within 20 min of their removal. Rat tissues and cultured cells were lysed in ice-cold TNE lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Thymi from mice injected with [125I]M808 were homogenized in lysis buffer supplemented with 25 μm M808. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the soluble fraction was quantitated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Caspase-3-like activity was determined with the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC as described previously (33Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L.C. Rowland K. Seiden I.M.

According to the equation, IC50 = Ki (1 + S/Km), which is applicable to reversible competitive inhibitors, the IC50 = 2 Ki under the conditions used. Ki is the inhibitory constant. The Ki values for M791 and M826 were determined on purified recombinant human caspase-3 at a final concentration of 0.15 nm in ICE III buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA), supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol and preincubated for 15 min with the indicated concentrations of M791 or M826. Recombinant human caspase-3 was a gift from Nancy Thornberry and was purified from Escherichia coli expressed subunits as described in Ref. 34Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M.

[125I]M808 Labeling and SDS-PAGE—Active caspases in tissue or cell extracts were labeled by incubating 60–80 μg of lysate with 1.25 nm [125I]M808 for 15 min at 25 °C. Labeling was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer (2% SDS, 0.35 m β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue) and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The Ki values for M791 and M826 were determined with [125I]M808 and purified recombinant human caspase-3 at a final concentration of 0.15 nm in ICE III buffer, supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol. Caspase-3 and the inhibitors were incubated 15 min with the indicated concentrations of M791 or M826 before the addition of the probe. [125I]M808 was added to a final concentration of 0.25 nm for 5 min before stopping the reaction by boiling in 1× Laemmli buffer. Caspase labeling in whole cells was performed as described below. Serum-starved Jurkat cells (0.5 × 106) were plated in CytoSF4 with camptothecin (3 μg/ml) and the indicated concentrations of caspase inhibitors for 4 h. The cells were then centrifuged at 350 × g for 10 min and then suspended in CytoSF4 containing 12.5 nm [125I]M808 and the indicated concentrations of caspase inhibitor for a 1-h incubation period at 37 °C. Labeling was stopped by washing the cells with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 25 μm M808. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in TNE buffer supplemented with 25 μm M808 and protease inhibitors. Rat thymocytes were treated the same way except that 3 million cells per assay were used. Labeling with 12.5 nm [125I]M808 was performed for 15 min at 37 °C. In vivo labeling of active caspases was performed by intravenous injection (jugular vein) of 125 μl of a 0.43 μm solution of [125I]M808 (1125 Ci/mmol) in 10% PEG200. Assuming an average blood volume of 1.25 ml per mouse, the expected initial blood concentration of [125I]M808 is 43 nm. Animals were euthanized 45 min after the [125I]M808 injection. Thymi were recovered and processed for protein extraction as described above. Denatured protein extracts in 1× Laemmli buffer were resolved through an 18% polyacrylamide SDS gel (Invitrogen) at 30 mA in Tris glycine buffer. All samples labeled with [125I]M808 were migrated until the dye front reached 0.5 cm above the end of the gel. All material 1 cm above the dye front was cut out to remove free [125I]M808. The gels were fixed for 45 min in a 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution and dried for 90 min at 80 °C under vacuum before exposure on MS Kodak film with MS intensifying screens (Kodak). Western Blotting—Proteins were resolved in an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a 45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen) in Tris glycine, 20% methanol buffer at 40 V for 2 h. Nonspecific protein binding was minimized by incubating the membranes for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk, TBS, 0.1% Tween 20). Caspase-3 antisera MF R280 and MF467 were raised in rabbits against recombinant large subunits (p17) of human and rat caspase-3, respectively. Both antisera were used at a 2000-fold dilution in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Membranes were washed in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 5000-fold in blocking buffer. The enhanced chemiluminescence reaction was performed with Supersignal West Femto chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry on 125I-exposed or chemiluminescence-exposed film was obtained using a Bio-Rad GS800 instrument and QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). A pixel saturation calibration curve was done before each scan, with saturated pixels appearing in red. Only signals that were well below the apparatus pixel saturation limit were quantitated. Background densitometric values corresponding to the identical area size of each quantitated bands were subtracted. In some experiments, an [125I]M808-labeled caspase-3 standard curve was performed to establish the linearity of the signal. A 20-fold dynamic range with a single film exposure time was achieved. IC50 Calculations and Statistical Analysis—Curve fitting was obtained using a sigmoidal Hill 4-parameter equation using SigmaPlot 8.0 software. Statistical analysis was performed by standard one-way analysis of variance. Where applicable, data were log-scaled so that underlying assumptions of equal variance and normality were better satisfied. All comparisons were deemed statistically significant at the 0.05 level. [125I]M808 Specificity and Sensitivity in Vitro—[125I]M808 is an iodinated trifluoromethylketone caspase inhibitor predicted to bind covalently and irreversibly to the active site cysteine located in the large caspase subunit (Fig. 1). The inhibitory profile of M808 against purified recombinant caspases indicates a slight preference (2-fold) for caspase-3 over caspase-8, and a 10-fold preference over caspase-7 (Table I).Table IM808 affinity for various caspasesKobs/[I]m-1 s-1Caspase-175,733Caspase-337,550Caspase-72,107Caspase-812,850 Open table in a new tab We tested the specificity of [125I]M808 for active caspases in crude protein extracts. Equal amounts rat tissue homogenates were either incubated with [125I]M808 or pretreated with granzyme-B to activate caspases prior to the addition of [125I]M808. In parallel, caspase activity in granzyme-B-treated extracts was measured by cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC. The large subunit of fully processed caspase-3 migrated at 17 kDa (p17). Partially processed caspase-3 retains part (p19) or all (p20) of the pro-domain (34Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), but is as active as the p17 form. 2S. Roy, unpublished data. Removal of the prodomain is self-catalyzed (33Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L.C. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As expected, the p17 subunit of purified recombinant human caspase-3 covalently bound [125I]M808 (Fig. 2A, first lane). All granzyme-B-treated rat tissues contained an [125I]M808-labeled 19-kDa protein, whereas liver and thymus showed an additional polypeptide migrating at 20 kDa (second through fifth lanes). The identity of the radiolabeled proteins as caspases was ascertained by several means. Radiolabeled proteins migrating at this position were not observed when granzyme-B was omitted (data not shown). Moreover, preincubation of the extract with the caspase-3-specific inhibitor M791 abolished (sixth through eighth lanes) or greatly reduced (ninth lane) the appearance of the radiolabeled proteins. Caspase activity, as measured by Ac-DEVD-AMC cleavage, correlated with the amount of radiolabeled p19/p20 proteins (Fig. 2B). [125I]M808 recognized polypeptides migrating at 17, 19, and 20 kDa in extracts of cells treated with the apoptotic inducers camptothecin or anti-Fas antibody. Labeling of a 70-kDa protein was also observed in NT2 cell extracts, but not Jurkat (Fig. 2C). The p17-, p19-, and p20-radiolabeled proteins were absent if the apoptotic inducer was omitted, or if M791 had been added in the extract, whereas labeling of the 70-kDa polypeptide was not affected. Taken together, these results demonstrate that [125I]M808 binds to caspases, including caspase-3, in a complex protein mixture. [125I]M808 Detects Caspase Activity in Animal Models of Apoptotic Injury—Using purified recombinant human caspase-3, the sensitivity threshold of [125I]M808 was established at 0.5 fmol (0.02 ng; Fig. 2D). The intensity of the radiolabeled signal was directly proportional to the amount of caspase-3, with a 20-fold dynamic range per film exposure (Fig. 2E). With different exposure times, a linear range of 0.5 to 100 fmol of caspase-3 was achievable (data not shown). We wanted to know if this sensitivity would be sufficient to detect active caspases in pharmacological models of caspase activation. To that end, [125I]M808 was incubated in tissue extracts from three animal models of ischemia and one animal model of sepsis. Hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) in neonatal rat brain leads to caspase-3 activation in the injured, ipsilateral side, but not the contralateral side (22Han B.H. Xu D. Choi J. Han Y. Xanthoudakis S. Roy S.

Incubation of rat brain extracts with [125I]M808 resulted in the labeling of a 17-kDa protein in ipsilateral but not contralateral extracts (Fig"

Endo1 has also been reported to affect endocytosis by converting membrane curvature via its lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity. Here we report that a closely related isoform of Endo1, Endo3, inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Mutational analyses showed that the variable region of Endo3 is important in regulating transferrin endocytosis. In the brain, Endo3 is co-localized with dopamine D2 receptor in olfactory nerve terminals and inhibits its clathrin-mediated endocytosis in COS-7 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of Endo3 in an olfactory epithelium-derived cell line suppressed dopamine D2 receptor-mediated endocytosis and therefore accelerated its dopamine-induced differentiation. These results indicate that Endo3 may act as a negative regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in brain neurons.

Endo1 binds, via its C-terminal SH3 domain, to proline-rich domains of Amphyphysin (15Micheva K.D. Ramjaun A.R. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S.

Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies using Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that the Endophilin-mediated recruitment and stabilization of Synaptojanin on synaptic vesicles is crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (16Schuske K.R.

Bellen H.J. Neuron. 2003; 40: 733-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition to the activity of its SH3 domain, the N-terminal domain of Endo1 has been shown to have lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPA-AT) activity; this enzyme converts lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and acyl-CoA to phosphatidic acid (PA) (11Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Since the cone shape of PA is more compatible with a high curvature than the inverted cone shape of LPA, Endo1 may promote negative membrane curvature by altering the composition of the donor membrane at the invaginating bud, thereby promoting the conversion of a shallow pit (11Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of Endo1 to liposomes is sufficient to deform them into narrow tubules (18Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). These observations provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that Endo1 generates membrane curvature during synaptic vesicle endocytosis (19Huttner W.B. Schmidt A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast to the neural expression of Endo1, the closely related protein Endophilin 2 (Endo2) is ubiquitously distributed throughout many tissue types (2Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Endo2 has been reported to interact with Endo1 via its coiled-coil domain, thus linking a number of neuronal targets to the endocytic machinery (20Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40424-40430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we assayed the involvement of a third mammalian Endophilin isoform, Endophilin 3 (Endo3), in receptor-mediated endocytosis. We show that, while structurally similar to Endo1 and -2, Endo3 is functionally distinct in its ability to inhibit clathrin-mediated transferrin endocytosis. We also show that Endo3 is expressed in the brain, including the olfactory nerve (ON) terminals, where presynaptic D2Rs are co-localized. We therefore investigated the ability of Endo3 to regulate D2R-mediated endocytosis in COS-7, HEK293T, and olfactory epithelium-derived cell lines. Dopamine was purchased from Sigma; (-)-[methoxy-3H]sulpiride (specific activity, 73.7 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; and restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, and KOD Dash DNA polymerase from Toyobo Co.

Cloning of Rat Endophilin cDNAs—Rat endophilin cDNAs were PCR amplified from a rat hippocampus cDNA library (21Irie Y. Yamagata K. Gan Y. Miyamoto K. Do E. Kuo C.H. Taira E. Miki N. J. Biol.

The amplified DNA fragments were directly sequenced in both directions. A rat testis cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with the rat endo3 cDNA probe according to standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.108-2.117Google Scholar). The expression plasmid used in this study was pEF-BOS (24Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Deletion constructs and chimeras between endo1 and 3 were made by two-step amplification using the overlap extension method (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The internal oligomer pairs were designed such that the 5′ appendage of one primer was complementary to the other oligomer, and the two DNA fragments resulting from the first PCR amplification were annealed prior to the second round of amplification. Site-directed mutations were created using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). Yeast Two-hybrid System Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (21Irie Y. Yamagata K. Gan Y. Miyamoto K. Do E. Kuo C.H. Taira E. Miki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2647-2653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Rat hippocampal cDNAs were subcloned in the SalI/NotI sites of the pPC86 vector, which contains the GAL4 activation domain, and the variable region and SH3 domain of Endo3 were subcloned in-frame in the SalI/NotI sites of the pPC97 vector, which contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The plasmids were used to transform PCY2 cells, and positive clones were selected on double-minus plates (Leu –, Trp –) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-7, HEK293T, and 13.S.1.24 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells grown to 50–70% confluence in 60-mm dishes were transfected with plasmids using FuGENE 6 or TransFast (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the internalization assay, cells were transfected with pEF-BOS-D2R along with plasmids encoding GRK2, endo3, endo1, or their mutants. In each transfection, the total amount of plasmids was adjusted to 5 μg by adding pEF-BOS vector. Dopamine-induced sequestration of human c-myc-tagged D2R was visualized by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy as described previously (26Ito K. Haga T. Lameh J. Sadee W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 μm dopamine at 37 °C for 120 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS(-)) and incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 120 min. Prior to drug treatment of the 13.S.1.24 cells, they were transfected with EGFP-N1, EGFP-endo1, or EGFP-endo3, and apomorphine was added after 2 days. The populations of differentiated bipolar cells were quantified by hand scoring. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test. Transferrin Uptake—COS-7 fibroblasts were transfected using TransFast for 36 h, after which the cells were transferred to serum-free medium and incubated overnight. The cells were subsequently incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 25 μg/ml biotinylated human transferrin (Sigma) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Transferrin uptake was visualized with Alexa488-conjugated streptavidin (green) using a Leica scanning confocal microscope (TCS-SP). Endo1 and Endo3 were detected using anti-Endophilin polyclonal antibodies followed by Alexa568-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes). Inhibition of endocytosis in transfected cells was defined as uptake of less than 5% of the transferrin taken up by untransfected cells in the same field, which ensured scoring of only strongly inhibited cells. Assay of Agonist-dependent Internalization—The assay for agonist-dependent internalization has been described previously (26Ito K. Haga T. Lameh J. Sadee W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Itokawa M. Toru M. Ito K. Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Arinami T. Hamaguchi H. Mol.

In brief, 1 day after transfection, cells in two 60-mm dishes were trypsinized and resuspended in 15 ml of medium, and 1.5 ml of suspension was dispensed into each well of a 12-well dish. The following day, 44–48 h after transfection, 10 μm dopamine was added, and the cells were incubated for various times. The reaction was stopped by placing the dishes on ice and washing the cells three times with cold PBS(-). The amount of D2R on the cell surface was determined by the binding of the hydrophilic, membrane-impermeable ligand, [3H]sulpiride (28Iwata K. Ito K. Fukuzaki A. Inaki K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cells were therefore incubated with 2.8 nm [3H]sulpiride in 1 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 150 min, washed twice with ice-cold PBS(-), and treated with 1% Triton X-100 solution. To each sample was added 3.5 ml scintillation mixture (Aquasol-2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the amount of [3H]sulpiride remaining was quantified with a scintillation counter (Tri-Carb, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific binding of [3H]sulpiride was determined by incubation in the presence of 10 μm haloperidol, a D2R ligand, and was found to be a maximum of 5% of the total binding. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Production of Recombinant Proteins and Antibodies—cDNA encoding full-length Endo3 (aa 1–347) was subcloned into pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and the construct was verified by sequencing. The host strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the resulting expression vector, and the recombinant protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using standard methods. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with GST-Endo3 fusion protein, and the antisera were affinity-purified by chromatography on GST-Endo3 immobilized on Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). The antibodies were further purified by passing them through glutathione-Sepharose columns coupled with GST-Endo1 and GST-Endo2. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses of rat brain and transfected cell lysates with anti-Endo3 or anti-pan-Endophilin antibody were performed as described previously (29Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Brain Res. 1992; 593: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—An olfactory bulb was extracted in 1.2 ml of TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extract was precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose and divided into two parts. 2 μl of affinity-purified anti-Endo3 antibody was added to one part, while 2 μl of preimmune serum was added to the other part, and the lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted into 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred and incubated with monoclonal antibody to Dynamin-1 or Synaptojanin-1. Immunohistochemistry—Adult female Wistar rats (8 weeks old, 200 g) were perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde fixative for 20 min. The brain was postfixed in the same fixative for 2 h, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS(-) solution and frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT Compound (Miles, Elkhart, IN) at -80 °C. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guideline for the Care and Use of Animals (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, 2000). Frozen olfactory bulbs were cut into 20-μm-thick sections with a cryostat. The sections were thaw-mounted onto silanized slides, air-dried, frozen, and stored at -80 °C until used. The brain sections were incubated with 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 10% Block Ace (Snow Brand Milk, Sapporo, Japan) for 1 h and then with rabbit anti-Endo3 (1:100 dilution) and mouse anti-D2R (1:500 dilution) antibodies at 4 °C for 4 days. Endo3 was visualized with the Alexa568-labeled secondary antibody. D2R signals were amplified with a Renaissance TSA Amplification kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For signal amplification, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody, followed by biotinyltyramide and horseradish peroxidase, and visualized using Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin. In Situ Hybridization—Olfactory epithelium samples were collected from female rats, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and decalcified in 8% EDTA for 1 day. Sections 12 μm in thickness were attached to silanized slides and incubated at 56 °C for 16 h with RNA probes of endo1 and endo3 labeled with digoxigenin in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 μg/ml tRNA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 300 mm NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) (30Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Hybridized RNAs were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG Fab fragment antibody (Roche Diagnostics), and signals were visualized using 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (Roche Diagnostics) as chromogenic substrates. Inhibition of Transferrin Endocytosis by Endophilin 3—To clarify the role of Endo3 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we assayed the effect of Endo3 on transferrin uptake (31Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) by transient expression of endo3 in COS-7 cells, with an empty vector or endo1 as controls. In contrast to control cells, which showed marked transferrin uptake, we unexpectedly observed an inhibition of transferrin uptake in endo3-expressing cells (Fig. 1b). To confirm this inhibition and to determine the Endo3 domain responsible, we interchanged the variable and SH3 regions of Endo1 and Endo3. Replacement of Endo1 domains with those of Endo3 (Endo1–3) resulted in the Endo3-phenotype for transferrin uptake; conversely, replacement of Endo3 domains with those of Endo1 (Endo3–1) resulted in the Endo1 phenotype (data not shown). The same pattern was observed in the absence of the Endo3 variable domain (Endo3(ΔV)) (Fig. 1, a–c). When we interchanged the variable regions of Endo1 and Endo3, we found that Endo1(V3) showed robust inhibition, whereas Endo3(V1) stimulated transferrin uptake (Fig. 1, a–c). These results strongly indicate that the variable domain of Endophilin is responsible for the regulation of endocytosis. To test the role of the Endophilin variable region in the regulation of endocytosis, we introduced additional structural perturbations by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1a). Secondary structure analyses of the Endophilins revealed that both Endo1 and 2 have short N-terminal α-helices in their variable regions, whereas the corresponding region of Endo3 has a β-turn. We therefore inserted the α-helical structure of Endo1 (MSLEF, corresponding to amino acids 261–265) into the N terminus of the variable region of Endo3 (Endo3(+H)), and we found that this fragment stimulated transferrin uptake (Fig. 1, b and c). Conversely, introduction of a point mutation into the middle of the α-helix of the variable region of Endo1 (Endo1L263P) resulted in marked inhibition of transferrin uptake (Fig. 1, a–c). These data are consistent with the notion that the α-helix in the variable region is important for the regulation of transferrin endocytosis. Expression of Endo3 in D2R-containing Olfactory Glomeruli— To address the functional role of Endo3 in neurons, we searched brain neurons, which express endo3 but not endo1,by in situ hybridization (30Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) for optimal expression of endo3. We found that olfactory mucosae were suitable for determining the function of Endo3. In situ hybridization revealed that endo3 mRNA was strongly expressed in the middle two-thirds of the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 2, a and c), corresponding to the location of the primary ON perikarya (30Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of endo1 mRNA in olfactory mucosae was much weaker than that of endo3 (Fig. 2, b and d). In addition, little signal was detected in sections hybridized with the endo3-sense control (data not shown). To determine the distribution of Endo3 protein in olfactory neurons, we generated an anti-Endo3 antibody and performed Western blotting, and we found that Endo3 protein was expressed in all brain regions, including the olfactory bulb (Fig. 2e). Among the G protein-coupled receptors expressed in the olfactory bulb, D2R is highly and selectively expressed on the ON terminals (32Koster N.L. Norman A.B. Richtand N.M. Nickell W.T. Puche A.C. Pixley S.K. Shipley M.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 411: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine whether Endo3 is co-expressed with presynaptic D2R in this region, we incubated olfactory bulbs with anti-Endo3 and anti-D2R antibodies, and we found that D2Rs were co-localized with Endo3 at the same glomerular synapses (Fig. 2, h–j). Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Endo3 was highly enriched in the presynaptic ON terminals, which are characterized by the presence of numerous synaptic vesicles (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that Endo3 is co-localized with presynaptic D2Rs on the ON terminals and may be involved in D2R-mediated endocytosis. Identification of Dynamin-1 and Synaptojanin-1 as Endo3-binding Proteins in the Brain—Since Endo3 has been reported to be testis-specific and to associate with testis-specific Dynamin-3 (2Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), we used the variable and SH3 domains of endo3 cDNA as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening system to identify the brain proteins that interact with it (21Irie Y. Yamagata K. Gan Y. Miyamoto K. Do E. Kuo C.H. Taira E. Miki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2647-2653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This screening led to the isolation of dynamin-1 and -3. To confirm that Endo3 is associated with Dynamin-1 in vivo, we immunoprecipitated Endo3 from an extract of olfactory bulbs and found that Dynamin-1 was co-precipitated (Fig. 2f). In addition, Synaptojanin-1 was co-precipitated with Endo3 (Fig. 2g), indicating that Endo3 forms a stable complex with Dynamin-1 and Synaptojanin-1 in olfactory bulbs. Effects of Endo3 Proteins on Presynaptic D2R-mediated Endocytosis—To verify the involvement of Endo3 in presynaptic D2R-mediated endocytosis, we reconstituted the assay system of D2R-mediated internalization after dopamine stimulation (26Ito K. Haga T. Lameh J. Sadee W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Itokawa M. Toru M. Ito K. Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Arinami T. Hamaguchi H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 560-566PubMed Google Scholar, 28Iwata K. Ito K. Fukuzaki A. Inaki K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). D2Rs are reported to be internalized in an agonist-dependent manner when GRK2 is co-expressed (26Ito K. Haga T. Lameh J. Sadee W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We assayed the effect of Endo3 on D2R internalization, which was detected as a decrease in [3H]sulpiride binding activity in cells treated with dopamine (Fig. 3a). Control cells, which were transfected with the expression vector alone, showed robust D2R internalization (41.9 ± 0.5%, n = 10) after 120 min of dopamine treatment. In contrast, there was little decrease in [3H]sulpiride binding (6.5 ± 0.7%, n = 10) when endo3-expressing cells were treated with dopamine (Fig. 3, a and b). Moreover, this inhibition was much stronger than that observed in cells expressing the SH3 domain of Endo3 (Endo3D in Fig. 3b, 26.3 ± 1.0%). Overexpression of endo1 led to an increase in the basal level of D2R endocytosis even before dopamine treatment (Fig. 3g), and dopamine-induced internalization of D2R in endo1-expressing cells was slightly reduced compared with that in cells expressing vector (Fig. 3b). When we examined D2R internalization in transiently infected cells by confocal microscopy, we found that Endo3 suppressed dopamine-induced internalization of the c-myc-tagged D2Rs. In cells expressing D2R and GRK2, D2R was located predominantly at the cell surface in the absence of dopamine (Fig. 3c). When these cells were treated with dopamine, the receptors were distributed in the intracellular endosomes (Fig. 3d). In endo3-expressing cells, however, there was almost a complete absence of D2R redistribution into the endosomes (Fig. 3f). Since Endo2 is the primary Endophilin isoform in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3i), our results suggest that exogenous Endo3 may inhibit D2R endocytosis by disrupting the interaction of Dynamin with endogenous Endo2. Promotion of Dopamine-induced Differentiation of an Olfactory Epithelial Cell Line Expressing Endo3—To confirm that Endo3 inhibits D2R endocytosis in olfactory neurons, we used a neuronal cell line generated by transfection of rat olfactory epithelium with the immortalizing recombinant oncogene E1A of adenovirus-2 (33Coronas V. Feron F. Hen R. Sicard G. Jourdan F. Moyse E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This 13.S.1.24 cell line has the phenotype of olfactory neuronal progenitors, and addition of dopamine has been shown to induce their differentiation into bipolar olfactory neurons. When we expressed the EGFP-Endo3 fusion protein in this cell line and treated it with the dopamine agonist apomorphine (10 μm), we observed that a large proportion of epitheloid cells underwent morphological differentiation into bipolar cells (Fig. 4, e and h). In contrast, apomorphine treatment of cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-Endo1 fusion protein resulted in the differentiation of a significantly smaller proportion of cells (Fig. 4, f and g). In addition, when we co-transfected myc-tagged D2R and the pEF-endo3 into these 13.S.1.24 cells line and immunostained them with anti-myc antibody, we observed inhibition of D2R-mediated endocytosis; in contrast, endocytosis was stimulated in cells co-transfected with myc-tagged D2R and pEF-endo1 or pEF-BOS plasmids (Fig. 4, a–d). These results suggest that Endo3 inhibits D2R endocytosis, resulting in the differentiation of epithelial cells into bipolar neurons. We have shown here that Endo3 is an inhibitor of receptor-mediated endocytosis. While overexpression of endo3 in COS-7 cells was associated with the arrest of transferrin endocytosis, this inhibition of transferrin uptake was abolished by replacing the variable region of Endo3 with that of Endo1. In olfactory neurons, only Endo3, not Endo1, was expressed. Endo3 inhibited the endocytosis of dopamine D2 receptors localized on olfactory nerve terminals, and this inhibition facilitated the dopamine-induced differentiation of a cell line derived from olfactory epithelium. Endo1 is required for the transition from early to late stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, as shown by the microinjection of anti-Endophilin antibodies at the giant synapse of the lamprey, which resulted in the accumulation of clathrin-coated pits at the presynaptic membrane (10Ringstad N. Gad H. Low P. Di Paolo G. Brodin L. Shupliakov O. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1999; 24: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutant Drosophila larvae lacking endophilin failed to take up FM1–43 dye in synaptic boutons, indicating an inability to retrieve synaptic membrane (13Guichet A. Wucherpfennig T. Dudu V. Etter S. Wilsch-Brauniger M. Hellwig A. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Huttner W.B. Schmidt A.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Verstreken P. Kjaerulff O. Lloyd T.E. Atkinson R. Zhou Y. Meinertzhagen I.A. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and the similarity of Endo3 to Endo1 and Endo2, we initially expected that Endo3 would activate the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Unexpectedly, however, our results showed that expression of Endo3 almost completely inhibited receptor-mediated endocytosis. The variable domain of Endo3 is composed of a β-turn, whereas that of Endo1 has an additional α-helix at its amino-terminal end. As the crystal structures of the Endophilins are not yet known, the sites responsible for inhibition of endocytosis were identified by mutagenesis. For example, when we inserted five residues (MSLEF aa261–265) from Endo1, which have a high potential to form an α-helix, into the corresponding portion of the variable region of Endo3, we observed reduced inhibition of transferrin endocytosis compared with wild type Endo3. Conversely, when we replaced a leucine in the α-helix of Endo1 with proline, we observed an inhibition of transferrin uptake equal to that seen with Endo3. The proline residue introduced a kink into the α-helix, which bends away from the side of the helix continuing the proline (34Woolfson D.N. Williams D.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that an amino-terminal α-helical structure in the variable region of the Endophilins regulates transferrin endocytosis. Similar findings have been described for Endo2, in that the presence of glutamate at amino acid 264 was shown to be required for its binding to voltage-gated calcium channels (35Chen Y. Deng L. Maeno-Hikichi Y. Lai M. Chang S. Chen G. Zhang J.F. Cell. 2003; 115: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A point mutation at this amino acid was found to eliminate this calcium-dependent interaction, as well as impairing synaptic vesicle endocytosis, indicating that this region is necessary for facilitation of endocytosis. Although there is as yet no direct evidence that this glutamate binds Ca2+, the replacement of glutamate with serine at the corresponding position of Endo3 suggests that it may work as a dominant negative regulator for other Endophilins. NH2-terminal LPA-AT activity was also shown to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. When we compared LPA-AT activity of the three Endophilins, we found that, although Endo3 had some LPA-AT activity, it was significantly lower than that of Endo2 (data not shown). Thus, overexpression of Endo3 protein in COS-7 cells may act as a dominant negative regulator by replacing endogenous Endo2, which induces positive-negative lipid membrane curvature along with conversion of the inverted cone-shaped LPA into cone-shaped PA. This N-terminal low LPA-AT model does not necessarily exclude inhibition via a variable region model. Either or both models may explain the ability of Endo3 to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis. The in vivo functional role of Endo3 in the ON terminals is of great interest. Axons from olfactory epithelium form the ON, which innervates the olfactory bulb (36Shipley M.T. Ennis M. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 30: 123-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). ON terminals make synapses with dendrites of both mitral and tufted and periglomerular cells, and periglomerular neurons can form reciprocal dendro-dendritic synapses with mitral and tufted cells (37Pinching A.J. Powell T.P. J. Cell Sci. 1971; 9: 347-377PubMed Google Scholar). Dopamine and D2R agonists are known to block synaptic transmission from the olfactory nerve to mitral and tufted cells (38Ennis M. Zhou F.M. Ciombor K.J. Aroniadou-Anderjaska V. Hayar A. Borrelli E. Zimmer L.A. Margolis F. Shipley M.T. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2986-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In other words, the activation of D2Rs presynaptically inhibits olfactory nerve terminals and decreases the ability to detect odors. We therefore hypothesize that dopamine-induced D2R internalization is suppressed by co-expression of Endo3 in ON terminals. For example, if an animal is tonically exposed to a strong odor, the glomeruli activated by this odor might release more dopamine, resulting in greater presynaptic inhibition. In the absence of Endo3 from the glomeruli, however, D2R would be internalized rapidly after odor stimulation. Under these conditions, feedback inhibition would not work satisfactorily, leading to sensing of the offensive smells. Thus, presynaptic inhibition of ON terminals via D2R is a potential mechanism for increasing the range of adaptation to strong odors. We have demonstrated here that Endo3 inhibits transferrin uptake and that its variable region is critical for the regulation of endocytosis. In addition, we have shown that suppression of D2R-mediated endocytosis by Endo3 accelerates dopamine-induced differentiation of olfactory epithelium-derived cells. These findings indicate that Endo3 acts as a negative regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, suggesting a new role of Endophilin in mediating physiological sensations. We thank Dr. R. J.

Using the murine enteroendocrine cell line STC-1, we investigated whether candidate intracellular pathways transduce the FA signal, or whether FA themselves act within the cell to release Ca2+ directly from the intracellular store. STC-1 cells loaded with fura-2 were briefly (3 min) exposed to saturated FA above and below the threshold length (C8, C10, and C12). C12, but not C8 or C10, induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i, in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. Various signaling inhibitors, including d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor antagonists, all failed to block FA-induced Ca2+ responses. To identify direct effects of cytosolic FA on the intracellular Ca2+ store, [Ca2+]i was measured in STC-1 cells loaded with the lower affinity Ca2+ dye magfura-2, permeabilized by streptolysin O. In permeabilized cells, again C12 but not C8 or C10, induced release of stored Ca2+. Although C12 released Ca2+ in other permeabilized cell lines, only intact STC-1 cells responded to C12 in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. In addition, 30 min exposure to C12 induced a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, but only a transient response in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. These results suggest that at least two FA sensing mechanisms operate in enteroendocrine cells: intracellularly, FA (≥C12) transiently induce Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. However, they also induce sustained Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium to maintain an elevated [Ca2+]i.

The ability to sense luminal nutrients after a meal is of fundamental importance in the gut epithelium. This serves to orchestrate digestion and so optimize nutrient assimilation. In addition, epithelial nutrient sensing is central to the short term control of food intake via gut to brain signaling pathways. After a meal, several gastrointestinal peptides are secreted by epithelial enteroendocrine cells (EEC). 1The abbreviations used are: EEC, enteroendocrine cells; CCK, cholecystokinin; 2-APB, 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate; SLO, streptolysin-O; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TG, thapsigargin. The pattern of secretion from EEC in vivo is complex, being encoded both chemically and anatomically, responding to the presence of specific macronutrient molecules in each luminal region (1Buchan A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1103-G1107PubMed Google Scholar, 2Furness J.B. Kunze W. Clerc N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G922-G928PubMed Google Scholar, 3Raybould H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G751-G755PubMed Google Scholar). This precision implies that a highly specific, nutrient-sensing apparatus must exist at a cellular and molecular level to produce appropriate EEC responses. However, the molecular bases for nutrient sensing by individual EEC are largely uncharacterized. In the proximal small intestinal epithelium, cholecystokinin (CCK) is a major EEC product and is secreted in response to free fatty acid. Also in this gut region, glucose evokes glucagon-like peptide 1 and 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion, amino acids induce gastrin release, and luminal acid causes secretin release. This categorization is a little oversimplified; for instance, dietary proteins can also stimulate CCK release (4Hira T. Hara H. Aoyama Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 5Nishi T. Hara H. Hira T. Tomita F. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, specific information about the nutrient environment in the lumen is transduced across the epithelium by EEC to activate local and distant reflexes. Of the various EEC cellular mechanisms, those involved in glucose-induced glucagon-like peptide 1 secretion by L-cells (6Reimann F. Gribble F.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2757-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 7Gribble F.M. Williams L. Simpson A.K. Reimann F. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) are best understood. Lipid sensing is less well explained. Our earlier studies demonstrate that 12 or more carbon atoms (C12) are required in the acyl chain for saturated fatty acids to stimulate CCK release in humans (8McLaughlin J.T. Grazia Luca M. Jones M.N. D'Amato M. Dockray G.J. Thompson D.G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 46-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and in the murine enteroendocrine cell line STC-1, where fatty acid exposure causes a reversible increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) (9McLaughlin J.T. Lomax R.B. Hall L. Dockray G.J. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. J. Physiol. 1998; 513: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Fatty acids are the most difficult nutrients to study, because they display complex physicochemical behavior in an aqueous environment. On account of their hydrophobic nature, once they exceed their limit of solubility they preferentially form insoluble aggregates unless a detergent such as bile is present. Bile salt secretion and, hence, this dissolution step, only occurs as a secondary event in response to the detection of fatty acids. The delivery of bile to the duodenum by gall bladder contraction is mediated by CCK. Therefore the system must initially be able to identify these unsolubilized fatty acids to secrete CCK in the first place. Our recent data have demonstrated that STC-1 cells are indeed able to respond to such unsolubilized particulate material, either lipid or nonlipid in origin, and this may underpin a component of the fatty acid response (10Benson R.S. Sidhu S. Jones M.N. Case R.M. Thompson D.G. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 11Kazmi S. Sidhu S.S. Donohoe T.J. Wickham M. Jones M.N. Thompson D.G. Case R.M. Benson R.S. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 759-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, this cannot be the sole mechanism because, under different physicochemical conditions (e.g. a Ca2+-free milieu), the same saturated fatty acids are far more soluble and effectively nonparticulate, yet still evoke a response from STC-1 cells. Hydrophobic lipids will rapidly leave aqueous solution to enter the lipid plasma membrane and, as our previous data show, are rapidly accumulated in the cytoplasm of STC-1 cells (12Sidhu S.S. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. Case R.M. Benson R.S. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is germane to the critical but unresolved issue as to whether fatty acids act on EEC at an extracellular or intracellular site. The relevant but uncharacterized signal transduction pathways activated by fatty acids clearly require identification. Intracellular fatty acid effects are the focus of the current study. We have analyzed in STC-1 cells the role of extracellular Ca2+ and intracellular Ca2+ pools in the C12-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, and the possible involvement of candidate signal transduction pathways. In light of the results from the initial studies, we then formulated and tested a novel hypothesis, that intracellular fatty acids can act directly and independently to induce Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Materials—Cell culture consumables (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, horse serum, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, trypsin, and EDTA solution) were purchased from Invitrogen. Saturated fatty acids (C8, C10, and C12), bombesin, poly-l-lysine solution (0.1% solution), U-73122, 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB), ryanodine, dantrolene, ruthenium red, thapsigargin, d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate sodium salt (IP3), antimycin, and oligomycin were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2-AM, magfura-2-AM, and pluronic F-127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Genistein, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, 8-bromo-, Rp-isomer ((Rp)-8-Br-cAMPs), and xestospongin C were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). ONO-RS-082 was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Streptolysin O was provided from Murex Diagnostics, NorCross, GA. Cell Culture—STC-1 cells (a gift from D. Hanahan, University of California, San Francisco, CA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, number 41965-039) supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were routinely subcultured by trypsinization upon reaching 80–90% confluency. For fluorescence imaging of intracellular Ca2+, cells were grown on 0.025% poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (1.3 cm2) at a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates and used 24–48 h after seeding. Cells between passages 50 and 60 were used. Other cell lines, PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma, ATCC), BON (human enterochromaffin, Dr. C. M. Townsend Jr., University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX), Caco-2 (human colon epithelial, ATCC), and IIC9 (Chinese hamster embryo fibroblast, ATCC) cells, were handled similarly to STC-1 cells. Cell viability was estimated by trypan blue exclusion and was always greater than 95%. Preparation of Fatty Acids—Fatty acids were dissolved in 99.6% ethanol and then diluted into extracellular or intracellular buffer (compositions described below), so as to produce working solutions with fatty acid concentrations between 100 and 500 μm. Each fatty acid solution was sonicated prior to use (SONICATOR XL, Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY) at level 9 for 3 min. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+Concentration in Intact STC-1 Cells—The cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined using dual-excitation fluorescence microscopy with the calcium-sensitive ratiometric dye fura-2-AM, as previously described (10Benson R.S.

Briefly, cells were loaded with 2 μm fura-2-AM dissolved in extracellular buffer, containing 0.015% Pluronic F-127 at 37 °C for 20 min. After loading, coverslips were mounted into a perfusion chamber and washed with extracellular buffer or Ca2+-free extracellular buffer. The chamber was placed on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence images were observed via a ×40 oil immersion lens, at an emission wavelength of 510 nm and were captured by a cooled slow scan CCD camera (Digital Pixel Ltd., Brighton, UK) at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. Images were acquired every 15 or 20 s, and the 340/380 nm ratio images were constructed and analyzed using Lucida 3.5 software (Kinetic Imaging Ltd., Bromborough, Wirral, UK). Normal extracellular buffer (pH 7.4) had the following composition (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 10 Hepes, 10 Hepes salt, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, and 10 glucose. In Ca2+-free extracellular buffer, CaCl2 was omitted and 0.2 mm EGTA was included. The pH of both buffers was adjusted to 7.4. Measurement of Ca2+Release from Intracellular Ca2+Stores in Streptolysin O-permeabilized STC-1 Cells—To measure the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores, cells were loaded with the low affinity Ca2+ indicator magfura-2 and then permeabilized with the bacterial protein streptolysin-O (SLO) as previously described (13van de Put F.H. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). STC-1 cells on coverslips were exposed to extracellular buffer containing 2 μm magfura-2-AM and 0.015% Pluronic F-127 at 37 °C for 20 min. The coverslip was mounted into the perfusion chamber and washed with permeabilization buffer on the stage of the microscope as described above. Permeabilization buffer contained 135 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.1). The free Mg2+ concentration was calculated as 0.9 mm, being adjusted with MgCl2 according to a previously described method (14Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870, 876-874, 879Google Scholar). To observe the real time process of cytosolic dye leakage, cells loaded with magfura-2 were excited at 360 nm, the isosbestic wavelength for magfura-2, and the permeabilization procedure was performed on the microscope stage in permeabilization buffer containing 0.5 units/ml SLO. After exposure to SLO solution for 5–10 min, cytosolic magfura-2 was visibly lost and the fluorescence intensity at 360 nm significantly dropped. Permeabilized cells were then washed with Ca2+-free intracellular buffer containing: 1 mm ATP, 135 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.1), and 0.9 mm free Mg2+, for 5 min to remove residual SLO. To load Ca2+ into the intracellular Ca2+ stores, permeabilized cells were exposed to intracellular buffer containing 0.2 μm free Ca2+, 0.9 mm free Mg2+, 1 mm ATP, 135 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.1). For Ca2+ uptake experiments, cells were washed with the permeabilization buffer (free of ATP and Ca2+), then exposed to the buffer containing Ca2+ but devoid of ATP for 2 min. Uptake of Ca2+ was then initiated by exposure to the intracellular buffer containing ATP and Ca2+. After Ca2+ loading for 5 min, permeabilized cells were exposed to test agents to examine stimulatory effects on Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Because magfura-2 has spectral properties similar to fura-2, images were acquired and analyzed as described above for fura-2. Data Analysis—Data were calculated by determining ratio values for each of the individual cells (10–40 cells) in a microscope field. All data are representative of at least three individual experiments. Significant differences were determined by Student's unpaired t test. Fatty Acids Elevate [Ca2+]i in the Absence of Extracellular Ca2+—To investigate the contribution of intracellular Ca2+ stores to fatty acid-induced [Ca2+]i responses, STC-1 cells were exposed to fatty acids in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. In both cases, C12 at 500 μm induced a rise in [Ca2+]i. However, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the rise was more rapid (Fig. 1A). This response was dose dependent (Fig. 1B). STC-1 cells were also exposed to different chain length fatty acids. As shown in Fig. 1C, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, C12 but not C8 or C10, induced an increase in [Ca2+]i. This chain length specificity corresponds to that reported by us both in humans (8McLaughlin J.T. Grazia Luca M. Jones M.N. D'Amato M. Dockray G.J. Thompson D.G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 46-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and in STC-1 cells under Ca2+ containing conditions (9McLaughlin J.T. Lomax R.B. Hall L. Dockray G.J. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. J. Physiol. 1998; 513: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In experiments measuring [Ca2+]i, the uncalibrated 340/380 nm ratio signal is generally presented as a surrogate for [Ca2+]i, because absolute estimates of [Ca2+]i are not routinely derived from ratio values. However, a two-point calibration of the fura-2 signal was carried out on a limited number of STC-1 cells as described elsewhere (12Sidhu S.S. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. Case R.M. Benson R.S. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Individual cells were initially treated with 1 μm thapsigargin and 1 μm ionomycin in Ca2+-free medium (containing 2 mm EGTA) to obtain fluorescence parameters for fura-2 under Ca2+-free conditions (Rmin). The cells were subsequently superfused with thapsigargin and ionomycin in Ca2+-supplemented medium to obtain fluorescence parameters for Ca2+-saturated fura-2 (Rmax). The 340/380 nm ratio signal was 0.99 ± 0.10 in resting cells (n = four experiments), corresponding to an estimated [Ca2+]i of 134 ± 22 nm (the Kd of fura-2 at 22 °C was taken as 135 nm (15Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). In Ca2+-containing conditions C12 (500 μm) typically raised the 340/380 fluorescence ratio by 0.25 ± 0.03, which corresponds to an estimated increase in [Ca2+]i of 68 ± 7 nm, which is around 200 nm, a value similar to those in our previous STC-1 studies (9McLaughlin J.T. Lomax R.B. Hall L. Dockray G.J. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. J. Physiol. 1998; 513: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Sidhu S.S. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. Case R.M. Benson R.S. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in other endocrine cell types (16Menezes A. Zeman R. Sabban E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Karlsson S. Sundler F. Ahren B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Hoenig M. Sharp G.W. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2502-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Ca2+-free conditions C12 (500 μm) typically raised the 340/380 fluorescence ratio by 0.35 ± 0.02, which corresponds to an estimated increase in [Ca2+]i of 83 ± 2 nm, which is around 220 nm. Finally, KCl (70 mmol) typically raised the 340/380 fluorescence ratio by 0.45 ± 0.05, which corresponds to an estimated increase in [Ca2+]i of 116 ± 11 nm, which is around 250 nm (Fig. 7A). C12Mobilizes Ca2+from Thapsigargin- and IP3-sensitive Intracellular Ca2+Stores—When intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted by the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) (Fig. 2A), C12 failed to induce [Ca2+]i responses in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. A similar result was obtained using the neuroendocrine peptide bombesin, which is known to activate the IP3 pathway in STC-1 cells (19Chang C.H. Chey W.Y. Erway B. Coy D.H. Chang T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G192-G202PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, bombesin induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, indicating release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. After Ca2+ release by bombesin, C12 failed to increase [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that C12 releases Ca2+ from the same intracellular store mobilized by IP3. Potential Pathways Involved in Fatty Acid-induced Ca2+Release from Intracellular Stores—To explore the signaling pathways involved in fatty acid-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, we examined the effect of pretreatment with several agents known to block intracellular signal transduction pathways linked to Ca2+ store mobilization. In the first instance, since C12 mobilizes Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive stores (Fig. 2A), pretreatment was undertaken with a PLC inhibitor, U73122 (10 μm, Fig. 3B), or an IP3 receptor antagonist, 2-APB (100 μm, Fig. 3C). However, both agents failed to block the C12-induced [Ca2+]i response although, as expected, both fully blocked the effects of 10 nm bombesin, a positive control of PLC/IP3-dependent Ca2+ release. Several other agents tested (data not shown), namely the IP3 antagonist xestospongin C, and a panel of ryanodine receptor antagonists (dantrolene, ruthenium red, and ryanodine used at >10 μm) also failed to block C12-induced [Ca2+]i responses, as did pertussis toxin, which inhibits Gi- and Go-coupled pathways, and genistein, which inhibits tyrosine kinase-linked receptor pathways. Although previous papers have demonstrated cAMP-dependent CCK release in STC-1 cells (20Chang C.H. Chey W.Y. Sun Q. Leiter A. Chang T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Prpic V. Basavappa S. Liddle R.A. Mangel A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the cAMP antagonist (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPs also failed to block C12-induced [Ca2+]i responses. Finally, thromboxane A2, an arachidonic acid cascade product generated by phospholipase A2 has been reported to induce Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (22Hertelendy F. Molnar M. Jamaluddin M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 83: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore the phospholipase A2 inhibitor ONO-RS-082 was tested, but it too failed to block the C12-evoked Ca2+ responses. This evolving mass of negative data raised the alternative hypothesis: that C12 itself, which gains rapid access to the intracellular compartment (12Sidhu S.S. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. Case R.M. Benson R.S. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was transducing its own signal. To assess this possibility, we developed a permeabilized STC-1 cell system in which the effect of C12 on the intracellular Ca2+ store can be assessed directly. Ca2+Stores Remain Functional in Permeabilized STC-1 Cells—The fluorescence image of magfura-2-loaded STC-1 cells was monitored while excited at 360 nm, the dye isosbestic wavelength, before and after treatment of cells with SLO. In intact cells, all cell compartments including the cytosol and nucleus were stained with magfura-2 after 20 min of loading. Three minutes after exposure to 0.5 units/ml SLO, fluorescence intensity began to decrease, and full permeabilization was achieved within 10 min. As a consequence of the loss of cytosolic magfura-2, together with the soluble cytosolic contents (including soluble signaling molecules), magfura-2 fluorescence became punctate, indicating that residual dye was compartmentalized into cell organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. To demonstrate that stores retained physiological functions in permeabilized cells, Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ release were evaluated under several conditions. The experimental protocol was adapted by initially exposing cells to Ca2+-free intracellular buffer containing 0.9 mm free Mg2+ and 1 mm ATP to rule out the possibility that the changes in the magfura-2 ratio were because of changes in intraorganelle [Mg2+], rather than [Ca2+]. Cells were then exposed to the same buffer, but containing in addition 0.2 μm free Ca2+, which resulted in an appropriate increase in the magfura-2 ratio as Ca2+ was sequestered into the organelles (data not shown). Because free Mg2+ concentration was maintained constant at 0.9 mm, any increase in magfura-2 ratio indicates an increase in [Ca2+] in cell organelles. The magfura-2 ratio was not changed by adding Ca2+ in the absence of ATP, but was increased in the presence of ATP, an effect that was appropriately prevented by 1 μm thapsigargin pretreatment (data not shown). These results confirmed that Ca2+ was sequestered into the organelles by a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-type Ca2+-ATPase. Exposing permeabilized cells to IP3 resulted in a rapid, dose-dependent release of stored Ca2+ (Fig. 4, A and D). By contrast, thapsigargin induced a slow and continuous decrease in the magfura-2 ratio, indicating the existence of a slow efflux of Ca2+ from intracellular stores that is normally masked by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-mediated Ca2+ re-uptake (Fig. 4B). When applied in combination with thapsigargin, IP3 induced a larger Ca2+ release than did IP3 or thapsigargin alone, almost completely depleting the stores (Fig. 4, C and D). These validation studies confirm that in permeabilized cells Ca2+ is still functionally sequestered into intracellular Ca2+ stores via Ca2+-ATPase, and that these stores are the source of the fluorescence we measured. Intracellular Ca2+ stores are not damaged by SLO permeabilization, as they are still appropriately responsive to physiological and pharmacological stimuli. C12 Induces Ca2+Release from Intracellular Ca2+Stores in Permeabilized STC-1 Cells—Having validated the model of permeabilized STC-1 cells, we next examined whether intracellular fatty acids can induce Ca2+ release. Permeabilized cells were exposed to C12 after loading Ca2+ into the stores. Exposure to C12 at ≥250 μm induced a rapid decrease in magfura-2 ratio (corresponding to release of 50% of loaded Ca2+), and the ratio dropped irreversibly to the basal value on exposure to 500 μm C12 (Fig. 5A). The magfura-2 ratio did not recover after removing C12. This might suggest that C12 has a nonspecific permeabilization effect on the ER membrane. To exclude this possibility, we isolated and analyzed the time course data for cells excited at 380 nm. As the denominator in the 340/380 ratio, this signal appropriately falls as calcium is loaded into the stores. Simple leakage of store contents would have caused this signal to fall upon C12 exposure because of dye loss. However, the 380 nm fluorescence rose upon C12 exposure, so that the overall 340/380 ratio fell. This is in keeping with a selective transmembrane flux of calcium (Fig. 5B). The effect of C12 on magfura-2 ratio was dose dependent (Fig. 5C). In contrast to the result in intact cells (Fig. 3C), exposure to 10 nm bombesin did not change the magfura-2 ratio in permeabilized cells (Fig. 5D) even though C12 induced a decrease in magfura-2 ratio in the same cell preparations. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake inhibitors (23van de Put F.H. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27764-27770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) antimycin (5 μm) and oligomycin (5 μm) did not impair the decrease in magfura-2 ratio induced by C12 (Fig. 5E). As in intact cells (Fig. 1B), C8 and C10 (500 μm) did not affect magfura-2 ratio, but subsequent C12 was still effective (Fig. 6, A and B). In summary, C12 evokes Ca2+ release from non-mitochondrial stores in permeabilized STC-1 cells.Fig. 6C8 and C10 do not induce Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in permeabilized STC-1 cells. Permeabilized cells were washed with the intracellular buffer containing 1 mm ATP and 0.9 mm free Mg2+ in the absence of Ca2+, then cells were loaded with 0.2 μm free Ca2+ for 5 min. Ca2+-loaded cells were sequentially exposed to: A, 500 μm C8 for 5 min and 500 μm C12 for 2 min; B, 500 μm C10 for 5 min and 500 μm C12 for 2 min. Values are mean fluorescence ratio ± S.E. of 10–30 cells obtained from a single experiment, and data are representative of at least three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Extracellular Ca2+Changes the Response Pattern to C12 and Is Necessary for Continuous [Ca2+]i Elevation—The above data indicate a direct effect of C12 on intracellular calcium stores. However, previous data have also shown that responses to C12 in Ca2+-containing medium depend largely on Ca2+ entry (9McLaughlin J.T. Lomax R.B. Hall L. Dockray G.J. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. J. Physiol. 1998; 513: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Sidhu S.S. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. Case R.M. Benson R.S. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that fatty acids may influence intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in more than one manner, probably depending on their mode of presentation. During short term exposure of calcium-free C12 to STC-1 cells, the [Ca2+]i response showed a very brisk rate of onset and decline. We went on to examine the Ca2+ dependence of C12 responses during longer exposures. Accordingly, STC-1 cells were exposed to 500 μm C12 for 30 min in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, the C12-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was maintained throughout the exposure (Fig. 7A). This response was also reversible, [Ca2+]i rapidly returning to basal values when C12 was washed out. In addition, STC-1 cells tolerate prolonged C12 exposure, responding promptly to depolarization (70 mm KCl) even after 30 min exposure to C12. In contrast, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, C12 induced only a transient Ca2+ spike, and the elevated [Ca2+]i returned to basal value within 10 min of starting continuous exposure to C12 (Fig. 7B)"
https://openalex.org/W1992585105,"Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, the first enzyme of the β-oxidation pathway, has been proposed to be involved in long chain fatty acid translocation across the plasma membrane of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. To test this proposal, we used an in vitro system consisting of Escherichia coli inner (plasma) membrane vesicles containing differing amounts of trapped fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and its substrates CoA and ATP. This system allowed us to investigate the involvement of fatty acyl-CoA synthetase independently of other proteins that are involved in fatty acid translocation across the outer membrane and in downstream steps in β-oxidation, because these proteins are not retained in the inner membrane vesicles. Fatty acid uptake in vesicles containing fatty acyl-CoA synthetase was dependent on the amount of exogenous ATP and CoASH trapped by freeze-thawing. The uptake of fatty acid in the presence of non-limiting amounts of ATP and CoASH was dependent on the amount of endogenous fatty acyl-CoA synthetase either retained within vesicles during isolation or trapped within vesicles after isolation by freeze-thawing. Moreover, the fatty acid taken up by the vesicles was converted to fatty acyl-CoA. These data are consistent with the proposal that fatty acyl-CoA synthetase facilitates long chain fatty acid permeation of the inner membrane by a vectorial thioesterification mechanism.

Translocation of fatty acids across the plasma membrane of cells is a critical first step leading to their utilization in energy storage, lipid biosynthesis, and energy production, as well as in transcriptional control, signal transduction, and regulation of protein function. Long chain fatty acid uptake and utilization by Escherichia coli is induced by growth of the bacterium on long chain fatty acids (1Klein K. Steinberg R. Fiethen B. Overath P. Eur. J.

These properties have been exploited to identify much of the machinery required for long chain fatty acid uptake in both bacteria and mammalian cells. Mammalian plasma membrane proteins that have been implicated in long chain fatty acid uptake include CD36/Fatty acid transporter (9Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 34-39Google Scholar). Homologues of the mammalian FATP genes have also been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and seem to play an important role in fatty acid uptake and growth on long chain fatty acids (12Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Google Scholar). In addition to protein-mediated pathways, long chain fatty acids seem to be able to cross the plasma membrane and model membranes by diffusion (reviewed in Ref. 13Hamilton J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidology. 2003; 14: 263-272Google Scholar). The relative importance of protein mediated versus diffusion mediated trans-bilayer movement of long chain fatty acids remains controversial (13Hamilton J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidology. 2003; 14: 263-272Google Scholar). Detailed genetic analyses in Escherichia coli have led to the identification of the fatty acid degradative (fad) regulon, which encodes genes required for long chain fatty acid uptake and utilization. These include fadR, which encodes a transcription factor regulated by fatty acyl-CoA (14DiRusso C.C. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 583-588Google Scholar, 15DiRusso C.C.

In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, long chain FACS is induced upon differentiation along with long chain fatty acid uptake activity and has been found associated with a variety of organellar membranes, including the plasma membrane (28Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Google Scholar). Elimination of long chain FACS in E. coli and in S. cerevisiae impairs long chain fatty acid uptake and the ability to grow on long chain fatty acids (1Klein K. Steinberg R. Fiethen B. Overath P.

DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16414-16422Google Scholar). Overexpression of long chain FACS in mammalian cells/tissues leads to increased long chain fatty acid uptake and triglyceride accumulation (10Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Google Scholar, 28Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Google Scholar, 30Chiu H.C. Kovacs A. Ford D.A. Hsu F.F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 813-822Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast and mammalian FATPs have sequence similarities to FACS and seem to possess some FACS enzymatic activity (28Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Google Scholar, 31Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Google Scholar). These studies have led to the idea that long chain FACSs may play an integral role either in directly facilitating or in driving the movement of long chain fatty acids across cellular plasma membrane. This concept has been recently called “vectorial acylation” and is supported by genetic studies in both E. coli and the yeast S. cerevisiae (21Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. Delio R. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29369-29376Google Scholar, 29Zou Z. Tong F. Fargeman N.J. Borsting C. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16414-16422Google Scholar, 32Black P.N. DiRusso C.C.

Biophys. 1999; 365: 299-306Google Scholar) and by the finding that overexpression of the putative fatty acid transport protein FATP and the long chain FACS in mammalian cells has synergistic effects on fatty acid uptake (28Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Google Scholar). To provide a direct biochemical test for the involvement of FACS in long chain fatty acid uptake, we have established a model system involving E. coli inner (plasma) membrane vesicles in which we have trapped different amounts of long chain FACS. Using this system, we demonstrate that the enzyme is a component of the long chain fatty acid transport machinery. The data support the proposal that fatty acid translocation of the plasma membrane involves a vectorial acylation mechanism. Furthermore, the results of this study taken together with those reported previously suggest that fatty acid permeation across the inner membrane of E. coli may occur by passive diffusion and that FACS may be needed to drive unidirectional fatty acid uptake by desorbing the fatty acid from the inner leaflet of the membrane and preventing efflux by converting them into the non-permeant CoA form. The E. coli ML308 strain (I–z–y+) was from the American Type Culture Collection. [3H]Oleic acid (10 Ci/mmol) and l-[3H]proline (15 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences. High volume, low pressure filters (0.45 μm) were from Millipore Corporation. The Mono Q HR 5/5 column, Superdex 200 prep grade, and Sephacryl S-1000 superfine were from Amersham Biosciences. E. coli ML308 was grown initially in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. An aliquot was diluted into MA medium (40.2 mm K2HPO4, 22.1 mm KH2PO4, 1.7 mm sodium citrate·3 H2O, 0.41 mm MgSO4·7 H2O, and 7.6 mm (NH4)2SO4) supplemented with either 30 mm glucose or with 5 mm fatty acid (either palmitate or oleate) and 35 mg/ml Brij 58 and grown at 37 °C (5Maloy S.R. Ginsburg C.L. Simons R.W. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3735-3742Google Scholar, 34Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Google Scholar). After reaching a density of 4.8 × 108 cells/ml, the cells were diluted 90-fold into the same medium freshly prepared and grown at 37 °C to a density of 4.8–6.4 × 108 cells/ml. To induce expression of the enzymes of the fad regulon, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium (42 mm Na2HPO4, 22 mm KH2PO4, 8.6 mm NaCl, and 18.9 mm NH4Cl) supplemented with 5 μg/ml thiamine, 5 mg/ml Brij 58, and 5 mm oleate at 37 °C (1Klein K. Steinberg R. Fiethen B. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 442-450Google Scholar, 2Overath P. Raufuss E. Stoffel W. Ecker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 24-33Google Scholar, 3Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Google Scholar). FACS was purified from the fatty acid-induced cells as described previously (35Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Google Scholar) with some modifications. The cells were lysed in an Aminco French pressure cell at 70,000 kilopascals. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex column (3 × 28 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The column was eluted with a 1.2 L linear gradient of 50 to 500 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 60 μm ATP. Fractions containing FACS activity (see below) were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to 50%. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, dissolved in 80 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm ammonium sulfate and 60 μm ATP and applied to a Superdex 200 column (1.6 × 62 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The fractions containing FACS were combined and applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. The column was eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of 0–1.4 M NaCl in 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 60 μm ATP. The fractions containing FACS were pooled and stored at –80 °C. Purity was tested by silver staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified sample. Method A. Isolation of Vesicles from Palmitate-induced Cells—The cells were grown at 25 °C in MA medium supplemented with 35 mg/ml Brij 58 and 5 mm palmitate as described above and harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and vesicles containing FACS were isolated as described previously (36Mangroo D. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 51-56Google Scholar, 37Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3376-3381Google Scholar). In brief, cells (2.5 g wet weight) were resuspended in 250 ml of digestion buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 20% sucrose (w/v) and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol) and stirred at 25 °C for 30 min. It is noteworthy that the inclusion of 20 mmd-lactate in the digestion buffer resulted in the association of FACS with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane; alternatively, in the absence of d-lactate, FACS did not associate with the plasma membrane (36Mangroo D. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 51-56Google Scholar). This allowed us to prepare vesicles either containing or free of FACS. The potassium salt of EDTA, pH 7.0, and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 10 mm and 2.3 mg/ml, respectively, and the digestion was allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 30 min. Spheroplasts were harvested at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, containing 2 mm magnesium sulfate, 10 μg/ml DNase I, and 10 μg/ml RNase A) with or without 20 mmd-lactate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with continuous shaking. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant (crude lysate) was centrifuged at 46,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet (vesicles) was resuspended in 13 ml of cold 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, with or without 20 mmd-lactate and centrifuged at 46,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The washed vesicles (induced) were resuspended in a small volume of cold 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and rapidly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen in small aliquots. Method B. Trapping of Pure Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase in Vesicles from Uninduced Cells by Freeze Thawing—Vesicles were prepared from cells grown in MA medium containing glucose (to suppress expression of the fatty acid degradation regulon, including the FACS gene) as described above. The vesicles (1.1 mg of protein/ml) (uninduced) were frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of varying amounts (0.5–2 μg) of pure FACS, 30 mm ATP, 3.5 mm CoASH, and 10 mm magnesium sulfate in 250 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The vesicles were thawed at 37 °C and allowed to reseal for 20 min at 37 °C. Vesicles containing FACS were purified at 4 °C by size exclusion on a Sephacryl S-1000 column (1.5 × 9.0 cm) pre-using 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, as the elution buffer (1.5 ml/min flow rate). Proline uptake was measured as described previously (34Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Google Scholar). Vesicles were incubated with 10 mm magnesium phosphate in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 (100-μl total volume), for 20 min with vigorous shaking. Fifty microliters of 80 mmd-lactate in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, was added. The assay was initiated by the addition of 50 μlof20 μm [3H]proline in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. At the specified time, 40 μl of the reaction mixture was diluted into 2.5 ml of 100 mm lithium chloride and filtered. The filter was washed once with 2.5 ml of 100 mm lithium chloride, and the radioactivity retained was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In some experiments, the membrane was energized by the addition of ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate at final concentrations of 80 mm and 0.2 mm, respectively, in place of d-lactate. To trap ATP and CoASH, vesicles (0.8 mg of protein/ml) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 10 mm magnesium sulfate with indicated concentrations of ATP and CoASH were frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed at 37 °C, and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The uptake assay was initiated by the addition of 150 μlof[3H]oleate (1320 Ci/mol) complexed to BSA (1246 μm oleate/350 μm BSA) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, to 150 μl of vesicles. At the specified times, 50 μl of the incubation mixture was added to 2.5 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2% BSA (w/v) and filtered. The filter was washed once with 2.5 ml of the same buffer and air-dried. The radioactivity retained was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The vesicles were incubated with [3H]oleate as described above. At the specified time, the whole incubation mixture was added to 2.5 ml of 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2% BSA (w/v) and washed once with the same volume of buffer. The lipids were isolated as described previously (38Abumrad N.A. Perkins R.C. Park J.H. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9183-9191Google Scholar) with modifications. The vesicles retained on the filter were extracted twice with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), and the extracts were combined. After addition of 1.5 ml of 0.01% sulfuric acid and the same volume of chloroform, phase separation was achieved by centrifugation of the samples. The organic phase was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, whereas the aqueous phase was evaporated under reduced pressure. The dried residues from the organic and aqueous phase were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and methanol/water (1:1, v/v), respectively, and analyzed by TLC using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v) for the former or butanol/water/acetic acid (50:30:20, v/v/v) for the latter. The radioactive products were visualized by fluorography (39Randerath K. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 188-205Google Scholar) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The conversion of [3H]oleate into [3H]oleoyl-CoA was used as a measure of FACS activity (35Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Google Scholar). Varying amounts of enzyme or vesicles (20–100 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (200 μl) containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 75 μm [3H]oleate (1.2 Ci/mmol), 10 mm ATP, and 2.5 mm CoASH. After 2 min, 100 μl of the incubation mixture was diluted into 500 μl of isopropyl alcohol/heptane/1 M sulfuric acid (40:10:1, v/v/v) to terminate the reaction. Heptane and water (300 μl of each) were then added to induce phase separation. The organic phase (containing [3H] oleic acid) was removed and the aqueous phase was extracted four times with 1 ml of diethyl ether. The total radioactivity in the aqueous phase (containing [3H]oleoyl-CoA) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Control reactions in the absence of ATP and CoASH were carried out and subtracted as blank values. β-Galactosidase activity (cytoplasmic marker enzyme) was determined at 25 °C by measuring as the increase in absorbance at 420 mm from the conversion of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside to o-nitrophenol in the presence of 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 0.5 mm o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside and enzyme solution (200–300 μg of protein) (40Malamy M.H. Horecker B.L. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1889-1893Google Scholar). Removal of β-oxidative enzymes from the inner membrane vesicles was monitored by measuring the activity of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The activity of the enzyme was assayed at 25 °C by following the decrease in NADH absorbance at 340 nm (41Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 574: 258-267Google Scholar) when samples (200–300 μg of protein) were incubated in a solution containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm NADH, and 25 μm acetoacetyl-CoA. The unbound oleate concentration in the presence of BSA was determined by the heptane phase partitioning method as described previously (7Trigatti B.L. Mangroo D. Gerber G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22621-22625Google Scholar, 42Spector A.A. John K. Fletcher J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 56-67Google Scholar). Characterization of Inner Membrane Vesicles Prepared from E. coli Grown on Long Chain Fatty Acids—To test the role of long chain FACS on long chain fatty acid uptake across the plasma membrane in the absence of other E. coli proteins involved in either fatty acid translocation across the outer membrane (FadL protein) or in later steps in β-oxidation, we used methods developed and characterized extensively by Kaback (34Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Google Scholar) for the preparation and use of right-side out E. coli inner membrane (i.e. plasma membrane) vesicles to study membrane transport processes. To induce long chain FACS expression, we grew E. coli on either oleate or palmitate as sole carbon sources. In contrast, Kaback (34Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Google Scholar) developed this system using cells grown on glucose as a carbon source. Therefore, we first tested whether inner membrane vesicles prepared from cells grown on either oleate or palmitate were comparable functionally to those prepared from cells grown on glucose. We chose to use proline uptake as a measure of membrane function because it is dependent on the integrity of the membrane potential and maintenance of the membrane energy potential is dependent on the integrity of the vesicles (34Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that proline uptake by inner membrane vesicles prepared from cells grown on palmitate (A) or glucose (B) was dependent on energization by the electron donors d-lactate or ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate, consistent with results reported by others (43Kaback H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 265: 367-416Google Scholar), and the magnitude of stimulation of proline uptake by d-lactate was similar in vesicles prepared from cells grown on palmitate and glucose (data not shown). Furthermore, proline uptake in vesicles from cells grown on either carbon source was completely inhibited in the presence of carbonylcyanide-3-chlorophenylhydrazone, a proton ionophore that is known to abolish the electrochemical proton gradient across the inner membrane of E. coli and mitochondria (data not shown). These experiments indicate that vesicles prepared from cells grown on palmitate are able to maintain a membrane potential and therefore are intact. We have previously demonstrated that the presence of d-lactate during lysis of E. coli cells grown on the long chain fatty acid oleate results in the association of FACS with the inner leaflet of the inner membrane, allowing the recovery of essentially all of the cellular FACS activity with inner membrane vesicles (36Mangroo D. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 51-56Google Scholar). Vesicles prepared from cells grown on oleate are also active in proline uptake (Fig. 2A, before freeze-thaw) and are therefore intact based on the criteria described above. To test the role of FACS in fatty acid uptake, however, it is necessary to introduce the substrates for this enzyme, CoA and ATP, into the vesicles by freeze-thawing (34Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested whether these vesicles remain intact after freeze-thawing by comparing the rates of d-lactate energized proline uptake in vesicles before and after freeze-thaw. Fig. 2 demonstrates that vesicles prepared from cells grown on oleate (A) loose activity (perhaps because of improper resealing of vesicles or to inactivation of the proline carrier), whereas vesicles prepared from cells grown on either palmitate (B) or glucose (C) retain full activity after freeze-thaw. Therefore, we used vesicles prepared from cells grown on palmitate (which also induces expression of the long chain FACS) to investigate the role of FACS on long chain fatty acid uptake. Fatty Acid Uptake in Inner Membrane Vesicles Containing Endogenous FACS—Having established that we could prepare intact and functional inner membrane vesicles from cells grown on palmitate, we use these vesicles to determine whether the presence of functional FACS affected long chain fatty acid uptake. These vesicles, prepared in the presence of d-lactate (36Mangroo D. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 51-56Google Scholar) retained ∼20% of the total cellular FACS activity but less than 1% of the cytoplasmic enzymes β-galactosidase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities (data not shown), indicating that the vesicles are essentially devoid of cytosolic components including enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway. The vesicles were subjected to freeze-thaw in the absence or presence of CoASH and either ATP or ADP and the uptake of [9,10-3H]oleate was assayed (Fig. 3). Oleate uptake by inner membrane vesicles was dependent on the presence of trapped substrates for FACS, CoASH, and ATP. In the absence of trapped exogenous ATP or CoASH or in the presence of only one of these substrates, the rate of oleate uptake was substantially lower. Furthermore, a very low rate of oleate uptake was observed if ADP was substituted for ATP in the presence of CoASH (Fig. 3) or if ATP and CoASH were added to the outside of the vesicles rather than trapped on the inside (data not shown). We reasoned that if oleate uptake was indeed dependent on the activity of FACS within the inner membrane vesicle, then the level of oleate uptake should be dependent on the amount of trapped ATP and CoASH. We therefore varied the amount of ATP and CoASH trapped within the inner membrane vesicles by subjecting them to freeze-thaw in the presence of varying amounts of either ATP (Fig. 4A) or CoASH (Fig. 4B), holding the other substrate constant. Fig. 4 demonstrates that the rate of oleate uptake increased in a saturable manner with the amount of ATP or CoASH included in the trapping reaction. The apparent Km values for ATP and CoASH are 1.34 and 131 μm, respectively. We also measured oleate uptake by FACS containing inner membrane vesicles with saturating amounts of trapped CoASH and ATP and incubated with increasing concentrations of [9,10-3H]oleate (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2001925394,"Buthotus judaicus toxin 1 (BjTx-1) and toxin 2 (BjTx-2), two novel peptide activators of ryanodine receptors (RyR), were purified from the venom of the scorpion B. judaicus. Their amino acid sequences differ only in 1 residue out of 28 (residue 16 corresponds to Lys in BjTx-1 and Ile in BjTx-2). Despite a slight difference in EC50, both toxins increased binding of [3H]ryanodine to skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum at micromolar concentrations but had no effect on cardiac or liver microsomes. Their activating effect was Ca2+-dependent and was synergized by caffeine. B. judaicus toxins also increased binding of [3H]ryanodine to the purified RyR1, suggesting that a direct protein-protein interaction mediates the effect of the peptides. BjTx-1 and BjTx-2 induced Ca2+ release from Ca2+-loaded sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in a dose-dependent manner and induced the appearance of long lived subconductance states in skeletal RyRs reconstituted into lipid bilayers. Three-dimensional structural modeling reveals that a cluster of positively charged residues (Lys11 to Lys16) is a prominent structural motif of both toxins. A similar structural motif is believed to be important for activation of RyRs by imperatoxin A (IpTxa), another RyR-activating peptide (Gurrola, G. B., Arevalo, C., Sreekumar, R., Lokuta, A. J., Walker, J. W., and Valdivia, H. H. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 7879-7886). Thus, it is likely that B. judaicus toxins and imperatoxin A bind to RyRs by means of electrostatic interactions that lead to massive conformational changes in the channel protein. The different affinity and structural diversity of this family of scorpion peptides makes them excellent peptide probes to identify RyR domains that trigger the channel to open.

The amino acid sequence of the three RyR isoforms has been completely elucidated, but due in part to their tremendous molecular size (∼5,000 amino acids/monomer), the exact structural motif(s) of RyR involved in excitation-contraction coupling, the ATP and Mg2+ regulation sites, as well as the Ca2+ activation and inactivation domains still remain uncertain and controversial (4Yamazawa T.

The limited availability of antibodies and other ligands against specific functional sites has also hampered the elucidation of the channel's most important structural domains. To date, only a few molecular probes of RyRs have been well characterized. Ryanodine, a plant alkaloid, has been used for identification and characterization of RyRs because it preferentially binds to the open state of RyRs, thus serving as an index of channel activity (7Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Welch W. Ruest L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar). Because venoms from spiders, snakes, and scorpions are rich in peptide toxins, they have been extensively exploited as a source of peptide probes specifically targeted to various voltage- and ligand-gated channels (8Furukawa K. Funayama K. Ohkura M. Oshima Y. Tu A.T. Ohizumi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Morrissette J. Kratzschmar J. Haendler B. el-Hayek R.

Beurg M. Sukhareva M. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 707-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). From the venom of the African scorpion Pandinus imperator, two components (IpTxa and IpTxi) have been shown to activate and inhibit RyRs, respectively (11Valdivia H.H. Kirby M.S. Lederer W.J. Coronado R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12185-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). IpTxa, a 3.7-kDa basic peptide (12Zamudio F.Z. Conde R. Arevalo C. Becerril B. Martin B.M. Valdivia H.H. Possani L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11886-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), increases [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal RyR, but not cardiac RyR, although it induces the appearance of long lived subconductance states in both isoforms (13Tripathy A. Resch W. Xu L. Valdivia H.H. Meissner G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IpTxa shares strikingly similar structural and functional properties with peptide A (14Gurrola G.B. Arevalo C. Sreekumar R. Lokuta A.J. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7879-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a peptide fragment from the II-III loop of the skeletal type dihydropyridine receptor α1 subunit, which also triggers Ca2+ release from the SR (15el-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By mutating some amino acids in the cardiac and skeletal II-III loop peptide, we found that a cluster of positively charged amino acid residues on the surface of the peptide A molecule is important for activation of skeletal RyRs (16Zhu X. Gurrola G. Jiang M.T. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of the common structural components for activation of RyR, as well as their binding sites in RyRs, will help us to better understand the mechanisms that control gating of the RyR. Other peptide probes for the RyR have been isolated, but they are not as well characterized as the above mentioned peptides. A peptide fraction of ∼4000-7000 Da molecular mass from the venom of the African scorpion Buthotus hottentota increases [3H]ryanodine binding and induces the appearance of subconductance states in skeletal RyRs (17Valdivia H.H. Fuentes O. el-Hayek R. Morrissette J. Coronado R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19135-19138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, Morrissette et al. (10Morrissette J. Beurg M. Sukhareva M. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 707-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) isolated ryanotoxin, an ∼11.4-kDa peptide fraction, from Buthotus judaicus scorpion venom, which similarly induces the appearance of subconductance states in skeletal RyRs. Nevertheless, it is not yet known whether these peptide probes consist of a single polypeptide or several distinct polypeptides of highly similar molecular weights and HPLC elution profiles (10Morrissette J. Beurg M. Sukhareva M. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 707-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is hard to exploit these peptides as probes to study the functional domains of RyRs. In this paper, we have been able to determine the structural components of two novel toxins from the venom of scorpion B. judaicus. We report purification and complete amino acid sequences of these toxins, which are able to activate RyRs, and we compare their structure and function with IpTxa. Materials—[3H]Ryanodine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bovine brain phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Purification of B. judaicus Toxins—100 mg of lyophilized B. judaicus venom (Alomone Laboratories Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) was suspended in 2 ml of water and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to separate the soluble fraction and the mucus. The mucus was re-extracted two more times. All the supernatants were pooled and adjusted to 5 mg of protein/ml. 150 μl of sample was injected into a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (System Gold, Beckman Instruments, San Ramon, CA). The peptide fractions were eluted with 0-67.5% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluted fractions were monitored at 214 nm. Each fractionated peak was collected and lyophilized. With the same amount of peptides (w/v) in each sample as determined by A214, the activity of HPLC peak fractions was determined by [3H]ryanodine binding. Amino Acid Analysis and Sequencing of B. judaicus Toxins—Amino acid analysis of B. judaicus toxins was performed on samples hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl with 0.5% phenol at 110 °C in evacuated, sealed tubes as described (18Becerril B. Corona M. Coronas F.I. Zamudio F. Calderon-Aranda E.S. Fletcher Jr., P.L. Martin B.M. Possani L.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Reduction of B. judaicus toxins with dithiothreitol, and alkylation with iodoacetic acid was performed as described (18Becerril B. Corona M. Coronas F.I. Zamudio F. Calderon-Aranda E.S. Fletcher Jr., P.L. Martin B.M. Possani L.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The sequences of the intact native and reduced/carboxymethylated B. judaicus toxins were determined using a model 6400/6600 automatic liquid-phase protein sequencer (Milligen/BioSearch Prosequencer) using standard Edman degradation programs and CD Immobilon membrane. To confirm the carboxyl-terminal sequence, 20 μg of B. judaicus toxin was hydrolyzed with Staphylococcus aureus V8 in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.8). The peptide fragments were purified and sequenced as described for native B. judaicus toxins. Computer Modeling—To generate the three-dimensional structure, we used Insight II Discover software from Biosym Technologies (San Diego, CA) running on a Silicon Graphics Octane RS10000 Workstation. Peptide P01 (19Blanc E. Fremont V. Sizun P. Meunier S. Van Rietschoten J. Thevand A. Bernassau J.M. Darbon H. Proteins. 1996; 24: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional structure of which has been determined by NMR, is a natural peptide from the North African scorpion Androctonus mauretanicus mauretanicus. The primary structure of peptide P01 is quite similar to the B. judaicus toxins we purified, thus it was used as the structural model for building. The three-dimensional structure of peptide P01 was obtained from the Entrez of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/). The electrostatic potential surface was analyzed using the Discover force field. Five hundred steps of minimization were performed using the steepest descent algorithm method until a root mean square deviation of 0.001 was obtained. SR Microsome Preparation and Purification of RyR1—Porcine skeletal, cardiac, and liver SR-enriched microsomes were isolated as described (20Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2365-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes from the last centrifugation were suspended in 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl and 5 mm Na-PIPES (pH 7.2). RyR1 was purified from microsomes using continuous 5-20% sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as described (21Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—[3H]Ryanodine binding to pig skeletal SR and other tissue homogenates was carried out as described previously (22el-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The standard incubation medium contained 0.2 m KCl, 10 μm CaCl2, 40 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.2), 7 nm [3H]ryanodine, 40-50 μg of pig skeletal or cardiac SR vesicles, and different concentrations of modulators as stated in each specific experiment. Samples (0.1 ml) were run in duplicate at 37 °C for 90 min. For binding assays with different calcium concentrations, 10 μm CaCl2 in the standard assay was replaced by 1 mm EGTA and CaCl2 necessary to set free calcium from 1 nm to 10 mm. Unless otherwise indicated, data represent the mean ± S.E. with n ≥ 2. Mathematical fitting of data was accomplished with the computer program Origin (version 7.0, Micro-cal Inc., Northampton, MA). Planar Lipid Bilayer Technique—Pig skeletal RyRs were reconstituted into Muller-Rudin planar lipid bilayers as described previously (22el-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Single channel data were collected at steady voltages (+35 mV, cis chamber grounded) for 2 min in symmetrical 300 mm cesium methane-sulfonate and 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.2). The recording solution contained ∼5 μm free Ca2+, as assessed by a calibration curve, which was sufficient to activate RyRs. Different concentrations of B. judaicus toxins were added to the cis chamber, which corresponded to the cytosolic side of the channel (22el-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Signals were digitized at 4 kHz and analyzed after filtering with a low-pass 8-pole Bessel filter at a sampling frequency of 1.5 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Axon Instruments software and hardware (pClamp version 8.03, Digidata 200 AD/DA interface). The full and subconducting current values were obtained from Gaussian fits to the amplitude histograms, as described previously (23Xiao R.P. Valdivia H.H. Bogdanov K. Valdivia C. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric Ca2+ Release Assay—Skeletal SR vesicles (∼50 μg of protein) were mixed in a 1-ml solution containing 95 mm KCl, 7.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 250 μm antipyrylazo III, 1.5 mm MgATP, 25 μg/mg creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm phosphocreatine and 20 mm K-MOPS, (pH 7.0). The solution was placed in a cuvette, incubated at 37 °C, and allowed to equilibrate for 2 min. Changes in free Ca2+ were monitored by changes in the absorbance of antipyrylazo at 710 nm and subtraction of the absorbance at 790 nm, at 1-s intervals, using a diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard Model 8452A). Initially, vesicles were actively loaded with CaCl2 until levels were close to the filling capacity (∼2 μmol of total Ca2+/mg of protein, usually 10 μl of 1 mm CaCl2 added 4 times). Thapsigargin (1 μm) was then added to block Ca2+ uptake. The absorbance signals were calibrated by addition of a known amount of Ca2+ to the complete transport mixture in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 to prevent Ca2+ accumulation. Purification of B. judaicus Toxin Activators—[3H]Ryanodine binds with high affinity (Kd ∼7 nm) to the open conformational state of the RyR. Thus, we used the standard [3H]ryanodine binding assay to characterize whole B. judaicus venom and to screen the peaks separated by HPLC fractionation (as described below). Whole B. judaicus venom stimulated [3H]ryanodine binding in a dose-dependent manner, and the effective concentration (EC50) for the whole venom was 400 μg/ml (Fig. 1C). To purify the active component, soluble proteins from whole venom were loaded onto a C18 reverse-phase column. Two peaks, eluted at 32.8 min and 36.4 min (Fig. 1A, arrows), effectively increased [3H]ryanodine binding, although most other peaks had no effect. (Two other peaks, one eluted at 6 min (not shown) and another eluted at 44 min, increased [3H]ryanodine binding marginally.) Thus, the two peaks at 32.8 and 36.4 min were collected and subjected to another analytical HPLC separation to verify their purity. Both fractions appeared as single, homogenous, and symmetrical peaks (Fig. 1B), and their purity was greater than 95%. The molecular weights, determined by mass spectrometry analysis, were 2888.95 ± 0.12 for peptide 1 and 2874.46 ± 0.37 for peptide 2. Interestingly, the molecular mass difference between peptide 1 and peptide 2 is only 15 Da, suggesting that these two peptides may have similar primary structures. Both peptides stimulated [3H]ryanodine binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). The EC50 for peptide 1 and peptide 2 was 8 and 20 μm, respectively. Because both peptides activating RyRs were purified from B. judaicus, we named them BjTx-1 and BjTx-2, respectively. Primary Structures—The complete amino acid sequences of BjTx-1 and BjTx-2 were determined by direct automated sequencing (Fig. 2). Both peptides are composed of 28 amino acid residues with a difference of only 1 amino acid at position 16 (i.e. a Lys in BjTx-1 but an Ile in BjTx-2). The molecular difference between Lys and Ile is 15 Da, and this precisely matches the difference in molecular mass between the two toxins as determined by mass spectrometry. This difference also explains the observed HPLC elution profile. Because Ile is a hydrophobic amino acid but Lys is electrically charged, BjTx-1 is more hydrophilic than BjTx-2 and thus elutes earlier in the reverse-phase column. The calculated molecular weights for the linear sequences are 2895 and 2880, respectively, which are 6 greater than the molecular masses determined by mass spectrometry. This suggests that both toxins may contain three pairs of disulfide bridges, which is a characteristic of most short scorpion toxins (forming a disulfide bridge removes two hydrogen atoms). However, unlike most small scorpion toxins, which are usually basic in nature, both B. judaicus toxins contain four negatively charged amino acid residues (Asp or Glu), but only two or three positively charged amino acids (Lys), making them acidic in general (calculated pI values for BjTx-1, 5.48; BjTx-2, 4.75). To compare the similarity of the two isolated toxins with other peptides, we searched GenBank™ of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), using the program Blast (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). B. judaicus toxins are highly homologous with scorpion peptide Lqhpep 2, from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus (24Buisine E. Wieruszeski J.M. Lippens G. Wouters D. Tartar A. Sautiere P. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and PepII, from Buthus sindicus (25Fazal A. Beg O.U. Shafqat J. Zaidi Z.H. Jornvall H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). They also share some similarity with peptide P01 from the scorpion A. mauretanicus mauretanicus, the three-dimensional structure of which has been determined by NMR (19Blanc E. Fremont V. Sizun P. Meunier S. Van Rietschoten J. Thevand A. Bernassau J.M. Darbon H. Proteins. 1996; 24: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, although the complete amino acid sequences of those three peptides have been determined, their biological function remains unknown. No significant similarity in primary structure is observed between both B. judaicus toxins and IpTxa, except that all three peptides contain 6 cysteines, enabling them to form three pairs of disulfide bridges (Fig. 2). Molecular Modeling of B. judaicus Toxins—B. judaicus toxins share some sequence similarities with scorpion peptide P01 and leiuropeptide II, the solution structures of which have been determined by NMR spectroscopy (19Blanc E. Fremont V. Sizun P. Meunier S. Van Rietschoten J. Thevand A. Bernassau J.M. Darbon H. Proteins. 1996; 24: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Buisine E. Wieruszeski J.M. Lippens G. Wouters D. Tartar A. Sautiere P. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The backbone fold for all of these structurally identified peptides (listed in Fig. 2) is virtually identical, albeit there are some differences in side chains and surface charges. Considering this information, we created a molecular model of BjTx-1 based on the three-dimensional structures of peptide P01 and leiuropeptide II. The molecular model was then subjected to energy minimization. As shown in Fig. 3, the backbone model of BjTx-1 includes an α-helix connected by a tight turn to a β-sheet. The α-helix extends from residues Cys3 to Gln14, with a Pro residue located at position 7, which may act as an α-helix breaker (19Blanc E. Fremont V. Sizun P. Meunier S. Van Rietschoten J. Thevand A. Bernassau J.M. Darbon H. Proteins. 1996; 24: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The antiparallel β-sheet is composed of two strands. The first strand extends from Ala15 to Asp20 and the second from Gly23 to Val28. The primary structures of both toxins are ordered as -Cys1-Cys2-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys3-Cys4-Cys5Xaa-Cys6-, a well known cysteine motif common to most scorpion toxins, including all the peptides we previously mentioned, and also charybdotoxin (26Schweitz H. Bidard J.N. Maes P. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9708-9714Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), iberiotoxin (27Galvez A. Gimenez-Gallego G. Reuben J.P. Roy-Contancin L. Feigenbaum P. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11083-11090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), margatoxin (28Garcia-Calvo M. Leonard R.J. Novick J. Stevens S.P. Schmalhofer W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18866-18874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and kaliotoxin (28Garcia-Calvo M. Leonard R.J. Novick J. Stevens S.P. Schmalhofer W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18866-18874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-helix and β-sheet are connected by three disulfide bridges, with the pattern Cys1-S-S-Cys4, Cys2-S-S-Cys5, and Cys3-S-S-Cys6 (19Blanc E. Fremont V. Sizun P. Meunier S. Van Rietschoten J. Thevand A. Bernassau J.M. Darbon H. Proteins. 1996; 24: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Corey-Pauling-Koltun model of BjTx-1 (Fig. 3, lower model) indicates the spatial orientation of all atoms of the amino acid residues forming the carbon backbone. Three pairs of disulfide bridges formed by 6 cysteine residues (yellow) remain buried inside the molecule and function to pull it together, whereas other amino acid residues are surface-exposed. Based on the calculated electrical potentials, there appear to be two potential electrostatic zones. One of them is positive, localized in the region around Lys11 and Lys13 in the α-helix and extending to Lys16 at the beginning of the β-sheet (blue residues, top of the molecule). Another charged surface area is a negative zone, including Glu4, Glu5 (dark red) and Asp20, Asp21 (magenta). Although far away in the primary sequence, these residues are adjacent to each other in the spatial arrangement because of the disulfide bridges. The backbone structure of BjTx-1 is virtually identical to that of peptide P01 (Fig. 3, middle column, upper model). However, the positively charged zone is absent in peptide P01, because there is only one Lys present on the top of the molecule (middle column, bottom model). On the contrary, the backbone structure of IpTxa (third column, upper model) and its three-dimensional structure, determined by NMR (29Lee C.W. Lee E.H. Takeuchi K. Takahashi H. Shimada I. Sato K. Shin S.Y. Kim do H. Kim J.I. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), have no similarity with BjTx-1. However, IpTxa also contains a positively charged zone, which is even more positive than that of BjTx-1, because five positively charged Lys (blue) and Arg (dark blue) residues exist in a cluster on the top of the molecule (third column, bottom model). Selective Activation of Skeletal RyRs by B. judaicus Toxins—To ascertain whether the B. judaicus toxins had any effects on the various RyR isoforms, we carried out [3H]ryanodine binding assays with tissues expressing different isoforms. Fig. 4 shows that both BjTx-1 and BjTx-2 increased binding of [3H]ryanodine to skeletal SR (RyR1). Bindings increased to ∼300% of control at a concentration of 8 and 20 μm (the Kd values of BjTx-1-RyR1 and BjTx-2-RyR1 interactions, respectively). Both toxins also slightly increased [3H]ryanodine binding to cardiac SR (RyR2), but to a much lesser extent than skeletal SR and had negligible effects on the binding of [3H]ryanodine to liver microsomes (mostly RyR3). These results suggest that B. judaicus toxins preferentially increase [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal type RyR1 isoforms. Similarly, it has been shown that IpTxa preferentially increases [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 and has a limited effect on RyR2 or RyR3 (22el-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). B. judaicus Toxins Interact with RyR1 Directly—To determine whether BjTx-1 and BjTx-2 had a direct interaction with RyR1 or mediated their effects through a regulatory protein, we purified RyR1 from skeletal microsomes and tested the effects of BjTx-1 and BjTx-2 on [3H]ryanodine binding. Fig. 5A shows RyR1 identified as a single, high molecular weight band in a silver-stained SDS gel, with no other proteins present. To exclude the interference of high salt (1 m NaCl) and [Ca2+] (300 μm) present in the purification buffer, we adjusted the salt and calcium to a final concentration of 0.2 m and 10 μm, respectively, by adding salt-free buffer and EGTA. BjTx-1 increased [3H]ryanodine binding to the purified RyR1 at concentrations of 2 μm (low dose) and 5 μm (high dose). BjTx-2, although having less affinity compared with BjTx-1, also increased [3H]ryanodine binding to the purified RyR1 at concentrations of 6 μm (low dose) and 20 μm (high dose) (Fig. 5B), suggesting that both toxins act on RyR1 based on a direct protein-protein interaction mechanism. This property is analogous to that of IpTxa, which also activates RyR1 by a direct interaction (14Gurrola G.B. Arevalo C. Sreekumar R. Lokuta A.J. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7879-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22el-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Effects of BjTx-1 and BjTx-2 on the Ca2+ Dependence of [3H]Ryanodine Binding—The Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 has been well established. In the range of pCa 9 to pCa 5, Ca2+ has an activating effect and increases [3H]ryanodine binding to the RyR, whereas in the range of pCa 4 to pCa 2, Ca2+ has an inactivating effect. Fig. 6A (black line) shows the dual effect of Ca2+ on RyR activity, which gives rise to the characteristic bell-shaped curve (30Fill M. Coronado R. Mickelson J.R. Vilven J. Ma J.J. Jacobson B.A. Louis C.F. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 471-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31Chu A. Fill M. Stefani E. Entman M.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the presence of BjTx-1 (filled circles) or BjTx-2 (filled triangles), the binding curves maintained the same bell shape; however, the absolute [3H]ryanodine binding values were increased above pCa 7. Both B. judaicus toxin curves maintained the same basal threshold as control, peaked between pCa 5 and pCa 4, and almost fully inhibited RyR activity at pCa 3. For further comparison, we normalized the data points with maximal binding at pCa 5 (Fig. 6B) and found no"
https://openalex.org/W2013411072,"A previously described system for biological selection of randomly mutagenized ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) employing the phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (Smith, S. A., and Tabita, F. R. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 331, 557–569) was used to select a catalytically altered form of a cyanobacterial (Synechococcus sp. strain PCC6301) enzyme. This mutant Rubisco, in which conserved glycine 176 was replaced with an aspartate residue, was not able to support CO2-dependent growth of the host strain. Site-directed mutant proteins were also constructed, e.g. asparagine and alanine residues replaced the native glycine with the result that these mutant proteins either greatly reduced the ability of R. capsulatus to support growth or had little effect, respectively. Growth phenotypes were consistent with the Rubisco activity levels associated with these proteins, and this was also borne out with purified recombinant proteins. Despite being catalytically challenged, the G176D and G176N mutant proteins were found to exhibit a more favorable interaction with CO2 than the wild type protein but exhibited a reduced affinity for the substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The G176A enzyme differed little from the wild type protein in these properties. None of the mutants had CO2/O2 specificities that differed markedly from the wild type. Further studies taken from the known structure of the Synechococcus Rubisco indicated that substitutions at Gly-176 affected associations between large subunits. Supporting experimental data included an unusual protein concentration-dependent effect on in vitro activity, differences in thermal stability relative to the wild type protein, and aberrant migration on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. From these results, it is apparent that residues not directly located within the active site but near large subunit interfaces can affect key kinetic properties of Rubisco. These results suggest that further bioselection protocols (using these proteins as starting material) might yield novel mutant forms of Rubisco that relate to key functional properties. A previously described system for biological selection of randomly mutagenized ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) employing the phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (Smith, S. A., and Tabita, F. R. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 331, 557–569) was used to select a catalytically altered form of a cyanobacterial (Synechococcus sp. strain PCC6301) enzyme. This mutant Rubisco, in which conserved glycine 176 was replaced with an aspartate residue, was not able to support CO2-dependent growth of the host strain. Site-directed mutant proteins were also constructed, e.g. asparagine and alanine residues replaced the native glycine with the result that these mutant proteins either greatly reduced the ability of R. capsulatus to support growth or had little effect, respectively. Growth phenotypes were consistent with the Rubisco activity levels associated with these proteins, and this was also borne out with purified recombinant proteins. Despite being catalytically challenged, the G176D and G176N mutant proteins were found to exhibit a more favorable interaction with CO2 than the wild type protein but exhibited a reduced affinity for the substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The G176A enzyme differed little from the wild type protein in these properties. None of the mutants had CO2/O2 specificities that differed markedly from the wild type. Further studies taken from the known structure of the Synechococcus Rubisco indicated that substitutions at Gly-176 affected associations between large subunits. Supporting experimental data included an unusual protein concentration-dependent effect on in vitro activity, differences in thermal stability relative to the wild type protein, and aberrant migration on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. From these results, it is apparent that residues not directly located within the active site but near large subunit interfaces can affect key kinetic properties of Rubisco. These results suggest that further bioselection protocols (using these proteins as starting material) might yield novel mutant forms of Rubisco that relate to key functional properties. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), 1The abbreviations used are: Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate; Ω, specificity factor; Kc, Km for carboxylase; Ko, Km for oxygenase; KRuBP, Km for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate; Vc, Vmax for carboxylase; Vo, Vmax for oxygenase; kcat, turnover number. the key enzyme of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham reductive pentose phosphate pathway, catalyzes the fixation of CO2 onto the five-carbon substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) yielding two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. Rubisco also catalyzes a competing monooxygenase reaction, whereby RuBP reacts with molecular O2 yielding one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate and one molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate. The rates at which Rubisco catalyzes the competing carboxylase and oxygenase reactions are determined by the inherent substrate specificity factor of the protein, Ω, and may be expressed by: vc/vo = Ω ([CO2]/[O2]). By definition, Ω = VcKo/KcVo, where V is Vmax and K represents the Michaelis constants for carboxylation and oxygenation (c and o, respectively). The production of 2-phosphoglycolate is the first reaction of a respiratory pathway, which ultimately leads to the loss of carbon from cells. It is not understood why different yet structurally similar Rubisco proteins possess inherent and variable catalytic efficiencies and substrate selectivities (1Tabita F.R. Photosyn. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Spreitzer R.J. Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The inherent kinetic properties of this bifunctional enzyme, particularly Ω, and the relative affinities for its gaseous substrates constitute a major limiting factor governing biomass yields of many industrially and ecologically significant microorganisms that fix CO2 as well as several economically important plants. For these reasons, there is considerable interest in elucidating the molecular factors that influence the variability in kinetic properties exhibited by structurally similar Rubisco enzymes. There have been multiple attempts to change or engineer Rubisco; however, no alterations have significantly influenced the physiology of the host organism so that some distinct benefit might be achieved. Recently a system was described for directed evolution of prokaryotic Rubisco genes using the purple, nonsulfur, phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus as a selective host (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). R. capsulatus is capable of aerobic growth using organic carbon (chemoheterotrophy) and can synthesize its own organic carbon through CO2 fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle either photosynthetically (photoautotrophy) or during dark aerobic growth (chemoautotrophy). The strain of R. capsulatus used in this system, strain SBI-II-, is a Rubisco deletion strain incapable of either photoautotrophic/chemoautotrophic or photoheterotrophic growth (4Paoli G.C. Vichivanives P. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4258-4269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) unless complemented in trans by exogenous Rubisco genes. Indeed, this system has the inherent advantage that growth of strain SBI-II- under these conditions is directly dependent on the properties of the Rubisco gene(s) employed for complementation. Thus, by expressing heterologous Rubisco genes in strain SBI-II- followed by complementation to CO2-dependent growth, the enzyme from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC6301 was chosen as a useful target to initiate bioselection studies. A positive selection condition was identified in which the wild type Synechococcus Rubisco genes were unable to support growth at levels of atmospheric CO2 lower than 1.5% but could support growth at concentrations of CO2 greater that 5%. Using this selection system a variety of mutant Rubisco proteins were isolated (some better able to support growth at low CO2 levels), and enzymes with inherent difficulties to support growth at higher levels of CO2 were also obtained (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition to the phenotype that Synechococcus Rubisco genes confer to R. capsulatus SBI-II-, these genes may also be conveniently expressed to produce recombinant enzyme in Escherichia coli. The previously solved x-ray structure (5Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25876-25886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) then allows one to better understand the positioning of mutated residues in the cyanobacterial enzyme. Furthermore, the cyanobacterial (Synechococcus) enzyme is a “green-like” Rubisco with high sequence and structural identity to plant enzymes, making it a suitable model to understand plant and eukaryotic Rubisco (1Tabita F.R. Photosyn. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Using the bacterial selection system, potentially interesting but defective enzymes were identified by their inability to complement R. capsulatus SBI-II- under conditions where the wild type enzyme was fully competent (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One particular residue, glycine 176 (Gly-176), was identified through this selection system. Specifically, a mutation that involved a change of Gly-176 to aspartate (G176D) resulted in an enzyme that was unable to complement strain SBI-II- to photoautotrophic growth in the presence of high levels of CO2. However, in a previous study G176 had not been shown to influence catalysis to any great extent (6Cheng C.Q. McFadden B.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The G176D enzyme and the newly constructed G176N and G176A enzymes were used to study the influence of residue Gly-176 in greater depth. In this report we show that the kinetic properties (Kc and KRuBP) of the G176D and G176N mutant proteins were greatly altered. In addition, the altered enzymes exhibited various degrees of reduced thermal stability and to differing extents showed an unusual protein concentration-dependent alteration in specific activity. These latter properties along with the potential for this residue to influence important associations of catalytic subunits suggest that the Gly-176 mutant proteins might serve as starting points for further mutagenesis and selection. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth—Construction of the Rubisco deletion strain of R. capsulatus strain SBI-II- was described previously (4Paoli G.C. Vichivanives P. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4258-4269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To maintain cultures, R. capsulatus was grown aerobically on peptone yeast extract plates (7Weaver K.E. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 507-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in a broth containing Ormerod's basal salts (8Ormerod J.G. Ormerod K.S. Gest H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 94: 449-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), 6 g/liter peptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 0.1 μg/ml biotin. Both media were supplemented with 1 μg/ml nicotinic acid and 1 μg/ml thiamine hydrochloride. Antibiotics in peptone yeast extract plates were used at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml rifampicin, 2 μg/ml tetracycline, 10 μg/ml spectinomycin, 5 μg/ml kanamycin. Growth of R. capsulatus under selective conditions lacking organic carbon (photoautotrophic growth) was performed using Ormerod's minimal medium (8Ormerod J.G. Ormerod K.S. Gest H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 94: 449-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 μg/ml nicotinic acid and 1 μg/ml thiamine hydrochloride. Plates for photoautotrophic growth were incubated in jars containing a CO2/H2-generating system (5–6% CO2, BBL GasPak system, BD Biosciences), and liquid cultures were bubbled with 1.5% CO2/98.5% H2 as described previously (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Growth rates were determined by removing 1-ml samples at 6–12-h intervals for absorbance readings at 660 nm. When cultures reached an OD660 between 1.2 and 1.5, where maximum levels of Rubisco activity are reached (data not shown), 40 ml were removed, the cells were washed with TE buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and the cell pellets were stored at -80 °C until needed for assays. Es. coli JM109 and pUC19 were used for routine cloning, and JM109 was also the donor strain in conjugations (9Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar, 10Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11408) Google Scholar). Es. coli HB101, which harbors the transfer genes required for conjugation on pRK2013, was used as the “helper” strain in triparental matings with Es. coli JM109 and R. capsulatus SBI-II- (11Boyer H.W. Roulland-Dussoix D. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar, 12Figurski D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). Epicurian coli® XL1-Red (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for random mutagenesis of genes encoding Rubisco as described previously (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All Ep. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C using 100 μg/ml ampicillin for cultures containing pUC19 or 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline for cultures containing pRPS-MCS3. The genes encoding Rubisco of Synechococcus PCC6301, rbcLS, were cloned into pUC19 to generate pUC6301, the plasmid used for mutagenesis in Ep. coli XL1-Red. Plasmid pRPS-MCS3 was constructed specifically for this selection system. It was derived from the broad host range plasmid pBBR1-MCS3 (13Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop II, R.M. Peterson K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar) and contained a Rubisco promoter from Rhodospirillum rubrum to express wild type and mutated rbcLS genes in R. capsulatus SBI-II-. The construction and properties of this plasmid were described recently (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Identification of XL1-Red Negative Mutant G176D—Plasmid pUC6301 was mutated by propagation in Ep. coli XL1-Red, reisolated, and digested with PstI and XbaI (MBI Fermentas) for subcloning of rbcLS into pRPS-MCS3 (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ligations were used to transform Ep. coli JM109, and the pRPS-MCS3 subclones were introduced into R. capsulatus SBI-II- by triparental conjugation (12Figurski D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). Mated cells were plated onto peptone yeast extract with rifampicin to select against Ep. coli and tetracycline to select against R. capsulatus that had not received the pRPS-MCS3 plasmid. These plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. Tetracycline-resistant colonies of R. capsulatus SBI-II- were tested for the ability to grow photoautotrophically. Isolates incapable of photoautotrophic growth were called negative mutants. It was verified by colony hybridization that the negative mutants contained rbcLS on pRPS-MCS3, and Western immunoblots revealed which mutants were capable of synthesizing a large subunit polypeptide. The negative mutant genes were sequenced as described previously (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The following sets of complementary primers were used to construct the site-directed mutants with the QuikChange kit from Stratagene using pUC6301 as the template. The mutant constructed is listed in bold, followed by the forward and reverse primer sequences, respectively: G176A, 5′-CCGTAGTTTTTCGCCGACAGAGCGAGTTTTGGTTTGATCGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCACGATCAAACCAAAACTCGCTCTGTCGGCGAAAAACTACGG-3′; G176D, 5′-GCACGATCAAACCAAAACTCGATCTGTCGGCGAAAAACTACGG3-′ and 5′-CCGTAGTTTTTCGCCGACAGATCGAGTTTTGGTTTGATCGTGC-3′; G176N, 5′-CCGTAGTTTTTCGCCGACAGTTCGAGTTTTGGTTTGATCGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCACGATCAAACCAAAACTCAATCTGTCGGCGAAAAACTACGG-3′. All mutations and a lack of undesired secondary mutations were verified by complete sequencing of rbcLS, and the genes were subcloned into pRPS-MCS3 for expression in R. capsulatus SBI-II- (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The pUC19 plasmids were used for expression of the mutant genes in Es. coli JM109. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Assays—Prior to assays, frozen cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in TE containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and low speed supernatants were obtained by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. High speed supernatants from Es. coli extracts were obtained by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Rubisco activity was measured by incorporation of 14CO2 into acid stable products (14Whitman W. Tabita F.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Total protein concentrations in samples were measured by a modification of the Lowry assay (15Markwell M. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5278) Google Scholar). The extracts were also used to verify Rubisco polypeptide synthesis by SDS-PAGE and Western blots (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205447) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed and visualized by chemifluorescence as described previously (4Paoli G.C. Vichivanives P. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4258-4269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of mutant enzymes to assemble into a holoenzyme was screened by Western blotting of nondenaturing gels containing extracts from some of the cultures and purified enzymes. Kinetic Measurements—Purified enzymes were required for measurements of kcat, Kc, and Ω as described previously (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-liter cultures of Es. coli JM109 containing pUC19 subclones of the wild type and mutant enzymes were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight, and harvested cells were disrupted by sonication. Rubisco was isolated from lysates by anion exchange chromatography using a Green-A dye affinity column (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and eluting with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. This was followed by 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation and ultracentrifugation of the products through a 0.2–0.8-m sucrose density gradient. The final sample was dialyzed against TEM buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0), and 1-ml aliquots were stored in TEM with 20% glycerol at -80 °C. The purified enzymes were used to measure kcat, Kc, KRuBP, and specificity as described previously (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protein Concentration Dependence and Activity—All enzyme preparations were diluted to 0.5 μg/μl in TEM with 20% glycerol so that the same volume of enzyme were added to each assay. Thus 10 μl of enzyme was added for 5 μg of Rubisco per assay, 20 μl for 10 μg, and so on. Samples were assayed by the standard protocol with 1-min assays for the wild type, K11R, and G176A enzymes and 5-min assays for the K11R/G176D, G176D, and G176N mutants. Relative activity was calculated as the percentage of activity in any given assay relative to the assay that contained 5 μg of the same Rubisco. Thermal Stability Assays—All enzymes were diluted to 0.5 μg/μl in TEM with 20% glycerol, which was the same buffer the enzymes had been stored in at -80 °C. 20 μl was used for a standard Rubisco assay, which served as the reference assay for calculation of relative activity. 200-μl samples were placed in a thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) heated to 55 °C. After 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min of incubation, 20-μl aliquots were removed and immediately assayed by the standard protocol. The wild type, K11R, and G176A enzymes were assayed for 1 min; the other mutants were assayed for 5 min. Different assay times were necessary to stay within the linear range of enzyme activity with respect to time. Relative activity was calculated as the percent of specific activity in the incubated sample relative to the specific activity in the reference assay prior to incubation. Residue Gly-176 and Growth Phenotypes—In a previous report (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a system was described whereby potentially interesting mutant forms of cyanobacterial Rubisco could be selected after random mutagenesis and complementation of a Rubiscodepleted strain of R. capsulatus. This strain, SBI-II-, was unable to grow photoautotrophically, photoheterotrophically, or chemoautotrophically unless genes encoding a functional Rubisco, such as rbcLS from Synechococcus sp. strain PCC6301, were provided in trans. Furthermore, when these genes were randomly mutagenized prior to introduction into R. capsulatus SBI-II-, altered forms of Rubisco could be identified based on the phenotype of SBI-II- complemented to photoautotrophic growth on minimal medium plates. Whereas the wild type genes enabled growth of the strain, genes carrying “negative” mutations either would not complement or would poorly complement the strain to photoautotrophic growth. In this manner we isolated a mutant enzyme that had an aspartate residue substituted for a highly conserved glycine residue at position 176 in the cyanobacterial enzyme. In a previous study (6Cheng C.Q. McFadden B.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), all of the glycine residues of the Synechococcus 6301 enzyme were changed, and residue Gly-176 (residue Gly-179 of spinach Rubisco) was found to influence activity; however, no further indications of its potential role in catalysis was reported. In light of our discovery that the G176D mutation grossly affected the photoautotrophic growth phenotype of R. capsulatus SBI-II-, we decided to focus on this residue further; additional site-directed mutants, G176A and G176N, were prepared to assist in these studies. We also reconstructed the G176D mutation to ensure that none of the effects previously observed were caused by changes in the strain background of SBI-II- or to mutations elsewhere on the pRPS-MCS3 plasmid. The growth phenotype of R. capsulatus strain SBI-II- was affected by all of the mutant enzymes studied, even the conservative G176A mutation. On photoautotrophic plates, none of the mutant enzymes complemented the strain to photoautotrophic growth after a week of incubation. In liquid cultures that were continuously supplied with 1.5% CO2/98.5% H2, the G176D and G176N enzymes supported growth although with doubling times nearly 3-fold higher than the wild type enzyme. The G176A enzyme was much less affected in its ability to complement strain SBI-II- under these growth conditions (Table I). Furthermore, Rubisco specific activity levels in crude extracts of photoautotrophically grown cells seemed to reflect the growth rates with the G176D and G176N mutants having activities that were only a fraction of those measured for either the G176A mutant or the wild type enzymes (Table I). To ensure that these low activities were not simply the consequence of poor expression of the mutant genes in R. capsulatus, the steady state levels of large subunit polypeptides were qualitatively assayed on Western blots of these same extracts, and there appeared to be no significant differences (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 also included a K11R mutant that was discovered as part of a different study and found to have no effect on the properties of the enzyme or the phenotype of R. capsulatus SBI-II- relative to the wild type enzyme (data not shown).Table IPhotoautotrophic doubling time and Rubisco specific activity for the Gly-176 mutant enzymesComplementing RubiscoDoubling timeaCalculated from the early logarithmic stage of growth; values are the averages of three determinationsSpecific activitybRubisco specific activity in nmol of CO2 fixed per min/mg of protein; values are the averages of three determinationshWild type35.0226G176D101.822G176N90.370G176A42.4189a Calculated from the early logarithmic stage of growth; values are the averages of three determinationsb Rubisco specific activity in nmol of CO2 fixed per min/mg of protein; values are the averages of three determinations Open table in a new tab Catalytic Properties of Gly-176 Mutant Enzymes—The kinetic properties of the purified enzymes were studied in vitro. Surprisingly, the G176D and G176N mutant enzymes had a higher affinity for CO2 than either the wild type or G176A mutant, and they had a lower affinity for the substrate RuBP (Table II). Note that despite the roughly 2-fold difference in the Kc for these mutants relative to the wild type there was no significant difference in specificity, at least with the precision of the employed specificity assay, indicating that parameters that were not measured, such as the Ko, were also probably affected.Table IIKinetic properties of the Gly-176 mutantsEnzymekcatVcKcaAverage of at least three independent assaysΩaAverage of at least three independent assaysKRuBPaAverage of at least three independent assayss-1μmol / min / mgμmμmWild type3.53.0183 ± 2037.8 ± 5.344.7 ± 7.2G176D0.30.297 ± 733.4 ± 3.0100.2 ± 14.3G176N0.40.3107 ± 134.3 ± 3.491.6 ± 18.0G176A1.31.1237 ± 2137.9 ± 5.740.0 ± 2.8a Average of at least three independent assays Open table in a new tab When determining the kcat of the G176D enzyme, it was noted that the kcat was difficult to validate at different concentrations of enzyme. Thus, an experiment was undertaken to examine this property for all of the mutant enzymes. The G176D enzyme consistently showed a pattern of increasing specific activity with respect to protein concentration up to a concentration of 291 nm (40 μg/assay). This property was not displayed by the wild type enzyme and perhaps only mildly exhibited by the G176N and G176A enzymes (Fig. 2). When this experiment was repeated with a constant concentration of Rubisco and increasing concentrations of bovine serum albumin, there was no effect (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the protein concentration dependence effect on enzyme activity exhibited by the G176D enzyme was a property specific to this Rubisco and not solely the consequence of increasing concentrations of just any protein. Protein Conformation—It is apparent that the ability of the holoenzyme to maintain its active conformation was compromised in the G176D mutant enzyme. The protein concentration effect described above, together with analysis of the known structure (5Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25876-25886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Knight S. Andersson I. Branden C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), suggested the potential for glycine 176 to influence large subunit associations into dimers and eventual formation to the catalytically important octameric core; alternatively, Gly-176 potentially influenced the ability of the octameric core to properly associate with small subunits to form the fully assembled and maximally active holoenzyme. As a potential indicator of holoenzyme stability, it was shown that the wild type enzyme retained substantial activity after 2 h of incubation at 55 °C. The mutant proteins, by contrast, had all lost more than 50% of their relative activities within the first 20 min of incubation (Fig. 3). Even the G176A mutant, which showed only minor differences relative to the wild type enzyme up to this time, lost significant activity after only 10 min of incubation at 55 °C (Fig. 3). Consistent with these results, the mutant enzymes, including the G176A enzyme, displayed aberrant migration on nondenaturing gels relative to the wild type enzyme, whereas qualitatively the stoichiometry of large and small subunits did not appear to differ between the wild type and the mutants under denaturing conditions (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 also contains two mutants in lanes 2 and 3 (K11R and K11R/G176D). As described above, the K11R mutation was found to have no effect on the properties of the enzyme or the phenotype of R. capsulatus SBI-II- relative to the wild type enzyme. Likewise, in the context of G176D, this mutation had no effect (data not shown), and it was therefore not germane to the experiments discussed here.Fig. 4PAGE of purified wild type Rubisco (lanes 1 and 7), G176D (lane 4), G176N (lane 5), and G176A (lane 6) enzymes in the presence (upper panel) or absence (lower panel) of SDS. Lanes 2 and 3 contain K11R and K11R/G176D mutants that were not part of the current study (under “Results”). The gel with SDS contained 15% acrylamide, and the gel without SDS contained 7% acrylamide. Approximately 2 μg of each purified sample were loaded onto the SDS gels, and 3 μg were loaded onto the nondenaturing gels. Both were stained with Coomassie Blue.

The inability of the Synechococcus PCC6301 Rubisco to complement R. capsulatus SBI-II- to photoautotrophic growth, predicted to be a consequence of the extremely high Kc (∼173 μm) of this enzyme (18Horken K.M. Tabita F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was the major rationale for using this enzyme in these initial studies. Although our original hypothesis was that a system of positive selection in which mutant enzymes capable of complementing SBI-II- to photoautotrophic growth under a low CO2 atmosphere might yield enzymes with improved affinity for CO2, the results given in this investigation and the previous study (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) so far indicate that negative selection produces the most useful and interesting mutant enzymes. Thus, in both studies mutant enzymes were selected that were unable to complement strain SBI-II- to photoautotrophic growth under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% H2; these are conditions where the wild type enzyme was fully competent. In addition, it was important to verify and choose mutant proteins that possessed no obvious gross folding defects as evidenced by the ability of the proteins to retain solubility and maintain some degree of catalytic competency (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this initial selection, the G176D enzyme represents one of the few mutants that does not have a gross folding problem and appears to be affected by some aspect of catalysis. Gly-176 (residue 179 in spinach Rubisco) is one of 22 glycine residues that is completely conserved in Rubisco. Note that another glycine, Gly-401 (residue 404 in the spinach enzyme), was identified through this selection process; however, the G401S enzyme obtained was shown to be folding/assembly-incompetent (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Gly-176 lies within a stretch of 7 amino acids that are completely conserved; these residues are localized in a loop preceding the first α-helix of the C-terminal domain of the enzyme near an interface between large subunits that participate in dimerization (5Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25876-25886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Knight S. Andersson I. Branden C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A broad survey of the effects of substitutions at conserved glycyl residues had previously identified Gly-176 as a potentially interesting residue (6Cheng C.Q. McFadden B.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but the properties of the G176A enzyme prepared in this earlier work differ somewhat from the results obtained for the G176A mutant prepared in the current study. In particular, Cheng and McFadden (6Cheng C.Q. McFadden B.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) described their mutant as having ∼18% wild type activity, although results described here placed it closer to 40–50% wild type activity. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the slight concentration-dependent effect on activity shown by this protein (Fig. 2). Although the amount of enzyme used in the assays performed by Cheng and McFadden (6Cheng C.Q. McFadden B.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was not reported, perhaps if higher concentrations had been used the reported activity would more closely resemble that which is reported here. In addition, the G176A enzyme was initially described as mildly defective in its ability to fold properly, but no data were shown. It is conceivable that the slightly altered migration on nondenaturing gels observed here might have been observed previously and leads to classification of the G176A enzyme (G179A in the Cheng and McFadden paper, Ref. 6Cheng C.Q. McFadden B.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as defective for folding/assembly. The protein concentration-dependent effect on maximal activity, particularly with the G176D enzyme, could be a consequence of forcing an equilibrium toward the association of large subunits into functional dimers, the fundamental units of Rubisco assembly. Interestingly, the nondenaturing gel shown in Fig. 4 may also support this notion. There appears to be significantly less protein in the mutant lanes on this gel (lanes 3–6). A possible explanation for this is that, if the association of large subunits has indeed been affected by substitutions at Gly-176, the decreased stability would result in a lower proportion of holoenzyme relative to total protein in the preparation. The dissociated subunits that may be present would migrate off of the gel, and there would appear to be a lower concentration of enzyme. At lower protein concentrations, a tendency for weak large subunit associations could also account for the observed thermal instability of enzymes with substitutions at residue 176. If this is true, then the results of the kinetic measurements for the Gly-176 mutant proteins support the hypothesis that the Kc and KRuBP are determined, at least in part, by conformational properties at a tertiary and possibly quaternary level. Our previous finding that a D103V mutation located in a region near the interface between large subunit dimers had the opposite effect on the Kc further supports this prediction (3Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our attempts to model the G176D mutation in silico (using the Swiss Protein Data Base viewer, version 3.7) indicate that any of the possible conformations assumed by an aspartate at this position would not be accommodated because the aspartate would contact neighboring residues. Disregarding this warning from the software because the G176D enzyme obviously reaches a conformation that has some catalytic competency and using the lowest energy conformation proposed by the software, the model produced (Fig. 5) indicated minor repositioning of some of the local residues with the most apparent change observed in threonine 72 of the opposing large subunit. This model as well as the in vitro data suggest that changing residue 176 to aspartate caused major conformational shifts in a localized region at the interface between large subunits in the dimers. It is conceivable that these changes in monomer association may subsequently be translated to larger conformational changes in the holoenzyme. The properties of decreased thermal stability and altered migration on nondenaturing gels seem to support this conclusion. An important feature of Rubisco enzymology is the activation of large subunits by a nonsubstrate molecule of CO2 resulting in the formation of a lysyl carbamate at a completely conserved lysine residue within the active site (Lys-201) (19Lorimer G.H. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 20Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 270-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lorimer G.H. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5321-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the absence of activation by CO2, RuBP and other sugar phosphates will inhibit Rubisco. Activated Rubisco is stabilized by a Mg2+ cofactor, which is essential for the carbamate to act as a general base, abstracting a proton from the substrate RuBP and forming an unstable enediol intermediate (22Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Both carboxylation and oxygenation proceed through this intermediate, and it is beyond that point that the chemistry diverges. The same active site residues, therefore, are required for either carboxylation or oxygenation. Rubisco activation was not the focus of this study, but it is worth noting that it was briefly investigated by comparison of the wild type and the original G176D mutant. No difference was noticed in this single activation assay (data not shown), but this property may be worth further investigation in future studies of this enzyme. It is also interesting to note that the mutations we have found that affected Kc (at residues Asp-103 and Gly-176) had no effect on specificity. At the outset of these studies, the Kc was the presumed “target” of positive selection, because we predicted the enzyme would require a lower Kc to enable R. capsulatus SBI-II- to grow photoautotrophically with lowered CO2 in the atmosphere. Furthermore, we hoped that such a mutant would have an increased specificity as a consequence of its decreased Kc (see the equation in the Introduction). These results and the results of several mutant studies that precede this reflect that the specificity parameter is recalcitrant to increases even when mutations result in a lower Kc as with the G176D and G176N mutants. Perhaps some of the mutant proteins described here will serve as a better starting material for further mutagenesis and selection, allowing us to obtain the long sought highly active improved specificity mutant proteins. For example, the G176D mutant has a better affinity for CO2 than the wild type enzyme but less than 10% of wild type carboxylase activity. Because this enzyme already possesses one of the desirable characteristics, i.e. low Kc, random mutagenesis might lead to a protein with either an enhanced kcat and/or normal KRuBP, which could be identified by the ability of such proteins derived from G176D to support photoautotrophic growth. It seems possible that such a mutant might retain the gains made in Kc. It could then be used in further rounds of selection under aerobic chemoautotrophic growth conditions where the levels of CO2 and O2 may be changed. Altering the relative concentrations of these gaseous reactants may target specificity mutations more directly. The complex nature of the specificity issue certainly suggests that multiple rounds of mutagenesis and selection will be necessary; the scenario outlined here might allow for such an approach where one aspect of catalysis is targeted (Kc) followed by another (kcat) and/or KRuBP. This stepwise approach, rather than gross recombination and shuffling, will allow us to keep track of which changes and residues are important. At the very least, biological selection will allow us to learn more of the molecular determinants that influence the affinity and/or association of the enzyme with its substrates and gaseous reactants. Alternatively, isolating suppressor mutations of the G176D, G176N, and G176A enzymes directly by selecting for mutations in those genes that restore normal growth of strain SBI-II- under photoautotrophic conditions should also prove fruitful.
