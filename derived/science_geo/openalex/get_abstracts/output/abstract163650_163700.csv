Here we demonstrate a direct functional role for GATA4 and GATA6 as regulators of cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth and gene expression. To model the increase in endogenous GATA4 and GATA6 transcriptional activity that occurs in response to hypertrophic stimulation, each factor was overexpressed in cardiomyocytes using recombinant adenovirus. Overexpression of either GATA4 or GATA6 was sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy characterized by enhanced sarcomeric organization, a greater than 2-fold increase in cell surface area, and a significant increase in total protein accumulation. In vivo, transgenic mice with 2.5-fold overexpression of GATA4 within the adult heart demonstrated a slowly progressing increase in heart to body weight ratio, histological features of cardiomyopathy, and activation of hypertrophy-associated genes, suggesting that GATA factors are sufficient regulators of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. To evaluate the requirement of GATA factors as downstream transcriptional mediators of hypertrophy, a dominant negative GATA4-engrailed repressor fusion-encoding adenovirus was generated. Expression of GATA4-engrailed blocked GATA4- and GATA6-directed transcriptional responses and agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, demonstrating that cardiac-expressed GATA factors are necessary mediators of this process.

Although initially a compensatory response that temporarily normalizes wall stress and augments pump function, prolonged cardiac hypertrophy is a significant risk factor for the development of future heart failure (1Levy D.

Cardiol. 1993; 22: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). Increases in wall tension and neural-hormonal stimuli are thought to directly activate various membrane-bound receptors and signal transduction cascades within cardiomyocytes resulting in the activation of immediate early genes and hypertrophic responsive genes such as c-jun, c-fos, c-myc, Egr-1,ANF,1 BNP, β-MHC, and skeletalα-actin (reviewed in Ref. 3Chien K.R Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling pathways that utilize protein kinase C, calcineurin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, small G proteins (Ras, Rac, Rho, and Cdc42), and the various mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases have each been implicated as hypertrophic regulators in cardiomyocytes (see Ref. 4Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin.

Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Receiving signals from these various transduction cascades, a number of transcription factors have been implicated as direct mediators of hypertrophic gene expression including AP-1, Elk1, Sp1, serum response factor (SRF), transcriptional enhance factor-1, nuclear factor of activated T-cells 3, NF-κB, myocyte enhancer factor 2, and GATA4 (4Passier R.

Physiol. 2000; 278: H796-H805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GATA4, -5, and -6 form a subfamily of zinc finger-containing transcription factors that are expressed in the heart and play essential roles in diverse developmental processes including differentiation and/or migration of cardiomyocyte precursors (reviewed in Ref. 17Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). GATA4, -5, and -6 contain a DNA binding domain consisting of two centrally located zinc fingers that preferentially bind to a 5′-(A/T)GATA(A/G)-3′ motif found within the regulatory region of most cardiac-expressed genes (reviewed in Ref. 18Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). For example, GATA4 has been shown to transactivate promoters from theANF, BNP, α-MHC, β-MHC,cardiac troponin C, cardiac troponin I,cardiac-restricted ankyrin repeat protein,sodium/calcium exchanger, A1 adenosine receptor,m2 muscarinic receptor, and the myosin light chain 1/3 genes (18Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Such a direct regulatory role is further supported by the observation that adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of antisense GATA4 into cultured cardiomyocytes inhibited the basal expression of certain cardiac-expressed genes (19Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested a role for GATA factors as transcriptional effectors of the hypertrophic response. For example, GATA factors were shown to be required for transcriptional activation of the β-MHC and angiotensin II type 1A receptor promoters during pressure overload-induced hypertrophy in vivo (13Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). GATA4 was also shown to functionally and physically interact with nuclear factor of activated T-cells 3, a transcription factor implicated in a calcineurin-dependent hypertrophy pathway in the heart (20Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). A number of reports have also shown an increase in GATA4 mRNA levels or functional activity in response to hypertrophic stimulation. Specifically, isoproterenol and PE stimulation increased cardiac GATA4 mRNA expression in the heart, as did electrical pacing of cultured cardiomyocytes (12Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Saadane N. Alpert L. Chalifour L.E. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H796-H805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, α-adrenergic agonist stimulation caused serine phosphorylation of GATA4 that was associated with an increase in DNA binding activity (14Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). More recently, vasopressin-induced pressure overload was shown to enhance GATA4 DNA binding activity in vivo (21Hautala N. Tokola H. Luodonpaa M. Puhakka J. Romppanen H. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although a number of reports have associated GATA4 with the cardiac hypertrophic process, it is largely unknown whether GATA4 directly functions as a necessary and/or sufficient mediator of the response. Because GATA factors each bind to a similar DNA sequence element it suggests a certain degree of functional redundancy among co-expressed family members (18Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). GATA6, but not GATA5, is expressed at comparable levels to GATA4 in the post-natal and adult heart implicating GATA6 as a potential regulator of basal and inducible gene expression (22Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Indeed, transient transfection assays in cultured cardiomyocytes showed that GATA6 is similar in potency to GATA4 as a transactivator of cardiac genes such as cardiac troponin C, ANF, and BNP (19Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). GATA6 also physically interacts with GATA4 resulting in cooperative activation of the ANF and BNP promoters (19Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, evaluation of GATA6 as a direct mediator of the hypertrophic response has not been reported. In the present study, we utilized recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene transfer that demonstrates GATA4 and GATA6 are each sufficient inducers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in culture. In vivo, transgenic mice expressing 2.5-fold more GATA4 specifically in the heart demonstrate cardiac hypertrophy and functional impairment, suggesting that GATA factors are sufficient regulators of the hypertrophic response. To assess the necessary function of cardiac-expressed GATA factors in the hypertrophic response, an adenovirus expressing a dominant negative GATA4-engrailed fusion protein was generated. AdG4-Engr-infected cardiomyocytes were refractory to PE-induced hypertrophy suggesting that GATA factors are important transcriptional effectors of the cardiac hypertrophic response. Preparation of primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was described previously (23De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat neonates were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, the hearts were collected, atria were removed, and the ventricles were cut into four pieces and subjected to 10 rounds of enzymatic digestion using 0.05% pancreatin and 84 units/ml of collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). The cells were differentially plated for 1 h in cell culture dishes to remove contaminating non-myocytes and then plated on gelatinized cell culture dishes and cultured overnight in M199 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mmol/liter). The following day the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in serum-free M199 medium, containing 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine. Protein extracts from cultured cardiomyocytes or heart tissue were prepared in extraction buffer (20 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 µm phenylasine oxide, 10 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, 10 µg/ml tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 10 µg/mlN-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) as described previously (23De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Protein samples were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and blocked in 5% milk for 1 h. Primary antibodies against GATA4, GATA6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and the FLAG epitope (Sigma) were incubated overnight at room temperature in 3% milk. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 3% milk and processed for chemiluminescent detection as described by the manufacturer (Vistra ECF; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclei-enriched protein extracts were prepared from cultures of primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes as described previously (24Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar), although a mixture of protease inhibitors was also added (CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two GATA motifs from the α-MHC promoter or the SRF binding site used in EMSAs was described previously (25Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed at room temperature for 20 min in 20 µl of reaction mixtures containing 10 µg of protein extract, 50,000 cpm of [32P]-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, 1 µg of poly(dI-dC)-(dI-dC), 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4 mmTris (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, and 2 µg/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. For cold competition experiments, a 100 molar excess of unlabeled self competitor oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (50 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA). Supershift experiments were carried out as described for a standard EMSA except that 0.6 µg of antibody was added. The mouse GATA4 and GATA6 cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNAI under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The Drosophila-engrailed repressor domain encoding amino acids 2–298 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pCS2+nls engrailed (27Fu Y. Yan W. Mohun T.J. Evans S.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into pCDNAI. The engrailed repressor domain was fused with the GATA4 zinc finger domain spanning amino acids 211–329 encoding the DNA binding and nuclear localization region. The resulting engrailed-GATA4 fusion was introduced into the EcoRI site of pECEflag, giving rise to pECEflag-engrailed-GATA4. The BNP-116 luciferase reporter was a gift from Dr. C. C. Glembotski (28Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A GATA-luciferase reporter containing six tandem copies of GATA sites linked to a thymidine kinase minimal promoter was a gift from Dr. Ichiro Shiojima and was described previously (29Yamagata T. Nishida J. Sakai R. Tanaka T. Honda H. Hirano N. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3830-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primary rat cardiomyocytes were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 6-cm plates. The total amount of DNA for each transfection was 3 µg/plate. Empty vector was used to normalize DNA amounts. When used, PE was added to cardiomyocyte cultures 24 h after transfection at a final concentration of 20 µm. 24 h later, cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed with a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The GATA4 cDNA was subcloned as an EcoRI fragment into the adenoviral shuttle vector pACCMVpLpA. A HindIII fragment containing the GATA4-engrailed fusion (with the flag epitope) described above was also subcloned into pACCMVpLpA. The GATA4 domain was cut out of pACCMVpLpA-GATA4-engrailed resulting in a construct encoding only the engrailed repressor domain (with the nuclear localizing sequence) and the 5′ FLAG epitope. These plasmids were cotransfected with pJM17 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells to produce recombinant adenovirus encoding GATA4, engrailed repressor domain, or the GATA4-engrailed fusion protein. Each adenovirus was plaque-purified, expanded, and tittered in human embryonic kidney 293 monolayers by agarose overlay. The GATA6-expressing adenovirus (AdGATA6), obtained from Drs. E. Suzuki and K. Walsh (30Nagata D. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Yoshizumi M. Mano T. Walsh K. Sata M. Kakoki M. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), contains an HA tag at the N terminus. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were infected with AdGATA4 or AdGATA6 at a m.o.i. of 25 pfu for 2 h and then cultured in serum-free M199 media for an additional 48 h. AdG4-Engr or AdEngr was used at a m.o.i. of 100 pfu. For immunocytochemical analysis, cardiomyocytes were fixed, blocked, and incubated with monoclonal antiserum against sarcomeric α-actinin and polyclonal ANF antisera at a dilution of 1:800 and 1:400, respectively, as described previously (23De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies included anti-mouse tetramethylrhodamine β-isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody and anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody used at a dilution of 1:400. Quantitation of cardiomyocyte cell surface area was performed on α-actinin-stained cardiomyocytes using confocal laser microscopy and National Institutes of Health image software and consisted of at least 100 cardiomyocytes in 20–30 fields at 400× magnification. This process was replicated in three independent experiments, and the data were combined. ANF quantitation involved scoring at least 15 fields of α-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes at 200× (typically 40 cells in each field), from three independent experiments. The rate of protein synthesis in cultured cardiomyocytes was determined by [3H]leucine incorporation as described previously with some modification (31Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, triplicate cardiomyocyte cultures in 6-cm plates were infected with adenovirus overnight, pre-incubated with leucine-free RPMI medium for 1 h, and followed by incubation with 2.5 µCi/ml [3H]leucine in the same medium for an additional 24 h. Subsequently, PE (20 µm) was added to the culture, together with leucine-free medium, and [3H]leucine incorporation was then quantified as described previously (31Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mouse GATA4 cDNA was subcloned by blunt-end ligation into theHindIII-SalI site of the α-MHC promoter-containing construct (32Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The Bluescript backbone was removed by SpeI digestion, and the α-MHC-GATA4 DNA fragment was gel-purified and injected into newly fertilized FVB oocytes, which were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant FVB recipients. Transgenic founders were identified by Southern blot using a [32P]-labeled 600-base pair human growth hormone polyadenylation sequence region as a probe. Animals were weighed and sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and the hearts were harvested, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, blotted dry, and weighed. Hearts were fixed in 4% formaldehyde buffered with phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin for histological sectioning. Longitudinal 10-µm sections were cut and stained with H&E or Masson's trichrome. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on anesthetized mice (continuous inhalation of 2% isoflurane) using a 15-MHz echocardiographic apparatus (HP5500). At least three independent measurements per animal were obtained by an examiner blinded to the genotype of the animal. A portion of left ventricle from each mouse was used for analyzing expression ofANF, BNP, and skeletalα-actin. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent, and 10 µg was fractionated on a denaturing formalin gel and transferred to nylon membrane. The membrane was probed with [32P]-labeled oligonucleotides that were described previously (33Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Jones S.P. Lefer D.J. Peng C-F. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Hybridization was quantified with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunny Vale, CA). The membrane was then stripped and re-hybridized with an oligonucleotide specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which was used to normalize signal intensity. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between experimental groups were evaluated for statistical significance using a Student's t test for unpaired data or one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To investigate the role of GATA factors as hypertrophic regulators, we first examined whether expression of GATA4 or GATA6 was altered by hypertrophic stimuli. As analyzed by Western blot, treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes with PE for 1, 3, or 24 h did not alter GATA4 or GATA6 protein levels (Fig.1 A), nor did fetal bovine serum (data not shown). GATA5 protein levels were undetectable in the postnatal heart (data not shown), consistent with a previous report (34Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). EMSAs were employed to examine whether DNA binding activity of GATA4 or GATA6 was affected by hypertrophic agonist stimulation. Cardiomyocytes were first infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either GATA4 or GATA6 to isolate their respective contribution to EMSA activity and their ability to respond to hypertrophic agonist. The GATA DNA binding site from the α-MHC promoter was incubated with protein extracts derived from cardiomyocytes stimulated with PE or saline vehicle for 3 h, and EMSAs were performed (25Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data demonstrate that PE stimulation enhanced GATA4 DNA binding activity by 2.1-fold (p < 0.05), whereas GATA6 DNA binding activity was unaffected (n = 5 individual EMSA reactions each) (Fig. 1,B and D). To verify specificity, unlabeled “self” oligonucleotide at 100-fold excess or specific antiserum to GATA4 or GATA6 was added (Fig. 1 B). The results indicate that hypertrophic stimulation in cardiomyocytes is associated with increased GATA4, but not GATA6, DNA binding activity. The regulation of endogenous GATA factors by hypertrophic agonist stimulation was also evaluated in non-infected cardiomyocyte nuclear extracts. EMSA conditions were modified so that endogenous GATA factors could be more readily detected, compared with the less sensitive conditions used in Fig. 1 B. Endogenous GATA DNA binding activity was significantly enhanced by PE stimulation (Fig.1 C). Antibody supershift experiments identified this increase in endogenous GATA DNA binding activity as being primarily comprised of GATA4 protein (data not shown). As a further control, the same extracts were also incubated with a serum response element-labeled oligonucleotide from the α-MHC promoter, previously shown to bind SRF from cardiac nuclear extract (26Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PE stimulation did not alter the DNA binding activity of SRF, suggesting comparable integrities between the different nuclear extracts (Fig.1 C). To assess the importance of GATA factor transcriptional responses in mediating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, a dominant negative GATA4-engrailed fusion construct was generated. Specifically, a cDNA fragment encoding the Drosophila-engrailed repressor domain was fused to the GATA4 zinc finger domains and a 5′ FLAG epitope to generate a mammalian expression plasmid and recombinant adenovirus (Fig. 2 A). Cardiomyocytes infected with AdG4-Engr showed robust protein expression of the predicted molecular weight by Western blotting against the flag epitope (Fig. 2 B). AdGATA4- and AdGATA6-infected cardiomyocytes (m.o.i. of 25 pfu) were also subjected to Western blotting to verify protein expression and to quantify the level of overexpression relative to endogenous protein (∼10-fold for both GATA4 and GATA6) (Fig. 2 B). The GATA4-engrailed fusion construct might act as a dominant negative by simply competing for GATA DNA sequence elements, by binding DNA elements and directly repressing transcription, or by dimerizing with endogenous GATA factors and preventing their DNA binding. Indeed, GATA4 and GATA6 factors were previously reported to homo- and heterodimerize in cardiac myocytes, suggesting at least one mechanism whereby dominant negative activity might arise (19Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To investigate these mechanisms, cardiomyocytes were infected with either AdGATA4 or AdGATA6 alone, or co-infected with AdEngr (control) or AdG4-Engr. Nuclei-enriched protein extracts generated from infected cardiomyocytes demonstrated GATA4- and GATA6-dependent bands (lanes 1 and5), which were not influenced by co-expression of engrailed alone (lanes 2 and 6) (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, co-expression of GATA4-engrailed attenuated both GATA4 and GATA6 DNA binding activities (lanes 3 and 7) (Fig. 2 C). Quantitation of this inhibition was performed from five independent DNA binding reactions, which demonstrated a 50 and 30% reduction of GATA4 and GATA6 DNA binding activities, respectively (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2 D). The GATA4-engrailed protein also directly bound DNA generating a slightly faster migrating band (lanes 3 and 7) (Fig.2 C). The identity of this band was confirmed by the addition of Flag antibody, which eliminated and supershifted this band (lanes 4 and 8) (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that AdG4-Engr could funct"

Apoptosis is triggered through a controlled program that is associated with distinctive morphological changes, including membrane blebbing, cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, chromatin aggregation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (1Willie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis involves a cascade of initiator and effector caspases that are activated sequentially (2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

The results demonstrate that Dex-induced apoptosis in MM cells is mediated by Smac, which activates caspase-9 by binding to and inhibiting XIAP. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a growth factor for MM, blocks Dex-induced release of Smac and apoptosis. Taken together, this study provides evidence for an Apaf-1-cyto-c-independent pathway mediating caspase-9 activation via Smac.

The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MM.1S cells were transiently cotransfected with FLAG-Apaf-1 and T7-Apaf-1 using SuperfectTM (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) and treated with 10 μm Dex for 24 h. Lysates from transfectants were then incubated with dATP and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-T7 (Novegen, Madison, WI) or anti-FLAG. MM.1S cells were also transiently transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-XIAP vector (26Mesner P.W.

MM.1S MM cells were also treated with Dex (10 μm) in the presence or absence of caspase-9 inhibitor LEHD-FMK (5 μm) for 24 h and then analyzed for apoptosis. Flow cytometric analyses: dual fluorescence staining with DNA-binding fluorochromes Hoechst 33342 (HO) and propidium iodide (PI) was used to quantitate the percentage of apoptotic (HO+PI−) cells using flow cytometry (The Vantage, Becton Dickinson), as described previously (24Chauhan D.

The results demonstrate that Dex treatment is associated with an increase in Smac levels in the cytosol at 24 and 48 h, with a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial Smac levels (Fig. 1 A). Dex-induced increase in cytosolic Smac and a corresponding decrease in mitochondrial Smac levels were specific, because no change was observed in the levels of tubulin protein and mitochondrial matrix protein, Hsp60, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained when patient MM cells were exposed to Dex (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that Dex-induced apoptosis is accompanied by accumulation of Smac in the cytosol. Smac is known to promote caspase activation in the cyto-c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway; therefore, we next examined the release of cyto-c triggered by Dex or IR in MM.1S MM cells. The cytosolic extracts from Dex- or IR-treated cells were subjected to immunoblot analyses with anti-cyto-c and anti-Smac. As in our previous findings (22Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Krett N. Halgren R. Rosen S. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29995-29997Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), treatment of MM.1S MM cells with Dex did not induce release of cyto-c in the cytosol (Fig. 1 C, upper panel); in contrast, γ-radiation (IR) stimulated the release of cyto-c (Fig.1 C, upper panel), demonstrating that the release cyto-c is functional in these cells. To assay for Smac release these immunoblots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-Smac. As seen in Fig. 1 C, both Dex and IR induced release of Smac in the cytosol. Furthermore, low to undetectable cytosolic Smac or cyto-c levels were observed in the untreated cells. Reprobing the immunoblots with anti-tubulin confirms equal protein loading (Fig. 1 C). Since Dex-induced apoptosis is associated with Smac release, but not cyto-c release, we next determined whether Apaf-1 oligomerization is required for Smac-related signaling. For these experiments, we utilized the same MM.1S MM cells model (22Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Krett N. Halgren R. Rosen S. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29995-29997Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) to determine whether IR or Dex induce Apaf-1 oligomerization. Cells were transiently cotransfected with FLAG-Apaf-1 and T7-Apaf-1 or empty vector and treated with Dex or IR. Cell lysates were incubated with dATP. As shown in Fig. 1 D, IR (lane 3), but not Dex (lane 2), induces Apaf-1 oligomerization in MM.1S MM cells (Fig. 1 D, lane 3). The finding that IR induces Apaf-1 oligomerization in MM.1S MM cells indicates that the Apaf-1 oligomerization system is functionally intact and served as a positive control. Taken together, these findings suggest that Dex-induced apoptosis in MM cells is mediated by Smac and is independent of cyto-c/Apaf-1 mechanism. To examine whether Dex-induced Smac release and apoptosis are associated with processing of caspase-9, the cytosolic extracts from Dex-treated cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-caspase-9. The results demonstrate that treatment of MM.1S cells with Dex induces proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9 into 37- and 35-kDa fragments (Fig. 2 A,upper panel). Reprobing the immunoblot with anti-tubulin confirms equal protein loading (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). We next assayed for catalytic activity of caspase-9 using LEHD-pNA conjugated substrate in a colorimetric protease assays (26Mesner P.W. Bible K.C. Martins L.M. Kottke T.J. Srinivasula S.M. Svingen P.A. Chilcote T.J. Basi G.S. Tung J.S. Krajeewski S. Reed J.C. Alnemri E.S. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22635-22645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Incubation of cytosolic extracts from Dex-treated MM.1S cells with LEHD-pNA was associated with efficient cleavage of LEHD-pNA (Fig.2 B). Although LEHD-pNA may be cleaved by caspases other than caspase-9, our study indicates that activated caspase-8 in MM.1S MM cells does not cleave this substrate (Fig. 2 B), further supporting its specificity for caspase-9. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that treatment of MM.1S cells with Dex is associated with activation of caspase-9. We next asked whether caspase-9 activation is an obligatory event during Dex-induced apoptosis. MM.1S MM cells were cultured with Dex in the presence or absence of caspase-9 tetrapeptide inhibitor LEHD-FMK for 24 h and then assayed for proteolytic cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. LEHD-FMK abrogates Dex-induced cleavage of both caspase-9 and caspase-3 (Fig. 2 C, left andright panel). In contrast, LEHD-FMK did not inhibit anti-Fas-induced caspase-8 or caspase-8-mediated caspase-3 cleavage in MM.1S MM cells (data not shown), further indicating the selectivity of LEHD-FMK for caspase-9. We next determined whether blocking caspase-9 activation affects Dex-induced apoptosis, MM.1S MM cells were cultured with Dex in the presence or absence of caspase-9 inhibitor LEHD-FMK for 24 h and then assayed for apoptosis using flow cytometric analysis with PI and HO dual staining to determine the percentage for PI− and HO+ apoptotic cells. Dex-induced apoptosis (51 + 3% apoptotic cells (n = 3)) was significantly inhibited in cells pretreated with caspase-9 inhibitor (27 + 2% apoptotic cells (n = 3)) (Fig.2 D). Other studies have demonstrated that caspase-9 proteolytically cleaves and activates procaspase-3 (14Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). In that context, our previous studies have shown that Dex triggers caspase-3 activation in MM.1S MM cells (22Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Krett N. Halgren R. Rosen S. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29995-29997Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Treon S. Urashima M. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Dex induces sequential activation of Smac → caspase-9 → caspase-3 and is independent of cyto-c·Apaf-1 apoptosome complex formation. We next determined the mechanism of Smac-mediated Dex-induced caspase-9 activation. Two potential mechanisms for capsase-9 activation have been suggested (18Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). First, the release of cyto-c leads to Apaf-1 oligomerization, which then activates caspase-9; second, Smac interacts with IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis protein), such as X-chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), and eliminates the inhibitory effects of IAPs on caspase-9 (27Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Since Dex-induced apoptosis is not associated with cyto-c release or Apaf-1 multimerization, we asked whether XIAP interacts with Smac during Dex-induced apoptosis. MM.1S MM cells were transiently transfected with Myc-XIAP and treated with Dex for 24 h. Cytosolic extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc and immunoblotting with anti-caspase-9, anti-Smac, or anti-XIAP. As shown in Fig.2 E, Dex treatment induces an interaction between XIAP and Smac. Importantly, Dex treatment also leads to dissociation of XIAP from caspase-9 (Fig. 2 E). Equivalent levels of transfected XIAP protein were confirmed by reprobing the filters with anti-XIAP (Fig. 2 E). These findings are in concert with other studies demonstrating that Smac promotes caspase activity of initiator caspase-9 by binding to and inhibiting IAPs (7Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar, 20Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). To explore the functional significance of Smac release during Dex-induced apoptosis, we utilized IL-6, a known inhibitor of Dex-triggered apoptosis in MM cells. IL-6 abrogates Dex-induced apoptosis in MM.1S MM cells (Fig.3 A, Refs. 23Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Treon S. Urashima M. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and 28Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), as evidenced by DNA fragmentation assay. To determine whether IL-6 affects Dex-induced release of Smac, MM.1S MM cells were treated with Dex in the presence or absence of IL-6 (100 ng), and cytosolic extracts were analyzed for Smac levels. The Dex-induced increase in cytosolic Smac was significantly abrogated in the cells pretreated with IL-6 (Fig.3 B). This IL-6-mediated block in the Dex-induced Smac levels was specific, because no change was observed in the levels of tubulin (Fig. 3 B). Additional evidence for supporting the role of Smac during Dex-induced signaling was obtained by utilizing Dex-resistant (MM.1R) MM cells. MM.1R cells were treated with Dex or IR for 48 h, and cytosolic extracts were analyzed for Smac levels. As shown in Fig. 3 C, IR, but not Dex, induces Smac release. The finding that IR induces release of Smac from mitochondria to cytosol in MM.1R MM cells indicates that the Smac release system is functionally intact and served as a positive control. The observation that IL-6 prevents Dex-induced Smac release and apoptosis, coupled with the lack of Smac release and apoptosis by Dex in MM.1R (Dex-resistant) cells, supports a role for Smac in mediating Dex-induced apoptosis and is consistent with the known resistance to Dex treatment in MM patients with advanced disease and high serum levels of IL-6 (28Chauhan D.

Collectively, the present study demonstrates that Dex-induced apoptosis in MM cells is associated with Smac release and caspase-9 activation, without concurrent release of cyto-c and Apaf-1 oligomerization. In contrast, treatment of Dex-resistant cells with Dex fails to induce release of Smac and apoptosis. Furthermore, IL-6 blocks Dex-induced apoptosis in MM cells and inhibits Smac release, thereby conferring Dex-resistance. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a Smac-dependent activation of caspase-9 and apoptosis, independent of Apaf-1/cyto-c (Fig.3 D), and suggest therapeutic strategies based upon targeting both Smac and XIAP. We thank Dr. Xiaodong Wang for providing Smac-related reagents and helpful suggestions. We also thank Dr. Emad S. Alnemri for providing FLAG- and T7-Apaf-1 cDNAs.

Here we show that their plasma membranes contain detergent-resistant membrane rafts that constitute a small fraction (4%) of the total membrane protein, with a complex mixture of proteins that differentially associate with rafts. Depletion of raft-cholesterol abrogates association of all proteins with no significant effect on cholesterol:protein ratios in the rest of the membrane, lipid asymmetry, deformability, or transport properties of the bilayer, indicating that cholesterol is critical for protein assembly into rafts and suggesting that rafts have little influence on several erythrocyte functions. Erythrocytes from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which lack glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, show significant elevation in raft-cholesterol but no increase in raft protein association, suggesting that raft assembly does not require glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, raft proteins do not bind directly to cholesterol, and only threshold levels of raft-cholesterol are critical for protein recruitment. Loss of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins had no effect on erythrocytic infection by malarial parasite or movement of raft markers into the parasite's vacuole. However, infection is blocked following raft-cholesterol disruption, suggesting that erythrocyte rafts can be functionally exploited and providing the first evidence for the involvement of host rafts in an apicomplexan infection.

Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). They have been implicated in a variety of sorting and signaling processes in cells (2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). They are presumably present in all cells and can be functionally isolated as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs)1 by virtue of their property of being insoluble in cold, nonionic detergents (3Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Despite some earlier concerns about DRMs, as reviewed by Brown and London (2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar), DRMs reflect at least a subset of raft-sorting properties in the membrane and have been very useful tools for studying rafts. But it is difficult to separate DRMs isolated from different compartments of a cell and analyze their resident proteins, which underlie the catalytic properties of interest ascribed to rafts. Mature human erythrocytes are unique in that they are terminally differentiated cells that comprise a plasma membrane and dense cytoplasm enriched in hemoglobin. They are devoid of intracellular organelles, lack endocytic machinery, and are incapable of de novoprotein or lipid biosynthesis (4Chasis J.A. Prenant M. Leung A. Mohandas N. Blood. 1989; 74: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that from mature erythrocytes, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, a transmembrane receptor, and a cytoplasmically associated signaling molecule can be isolated in DRMs that float with densities expected for rafts on sucrose gradients (5Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). But a basic characterization of the complexity of protein composition of isolated plasma membrane rafts, their association with cytoskeletal proteins, the relative abundance of cholesterol, its regulation of raft protein composition, and the role of rafts in erythrocyte function are not known. Biophysical studies using fluorescence anisotropy and chemical cross-linking data show rafts as submicron (70–200-nm) clusters of GPI-anchored proteins on cellular plasma membranes maintained at high levels of cholesterol (6Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 7Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Rafts were proposed by Simons and Ikonen (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar) to provide a model for sphingolipid-based sorting of apical proteins and basolateral proteins in polarized epithelial cells. Later, this model of hydrogen-bonded sphingolipid domains incorporated a basis for cholesterol-based microheterogeneity seen in membranes by proposing that cholesterol fills gaps between glycosphingolipids. Independent studies by Brown and co-workers (2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 8Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 10Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) have led to the development of a model that suggests that interactions between lipid acyl chains are critical for raft formation as liquid ordered domains (lo domains) in a fluid bilayer. One study suggests that glycosphingolipids are not required for raft formation (11Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been shown that individual proteins associated with rafts become disassociated in the absence of cholesterol (12Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), but whether cholesterol alone is sufficient for functional raft assembly in natural membranes has not been clearly established. In addition, the role of GPI-anchored proteins, known to be important for multiple raft functions has not been evaluated. GPI-anchored proteins may hydrogen-bond by virtue of the presence of hydroxyls on the carbohydrate moieties that links the lipid anchor in the membrane bilayer to the protein in the extracellular milieu. In mammalian cells, GPI-anchored proteins have long chain fatty acids, which favors their partitioning into lo domains. Thus, both by virtue of hydrogen bonding and acyl chain interactions, GPI-anchored proteins may contribute to raft composition and sorting in cells. Rafts have been implicated in a variety of membrane-sorting processes (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 13Verkade P. Simons K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 108: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that at cellular plasma membranes, rafts may sort out to of the phospholipid milieu to cluster into membrane invaginations, independent of endocytosis (14Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). However, additional studies suggest that rafts undergo endocytosis and that this is the dominant mode of their sorting and internalization in cells (15Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although erythrocytes are non-endocytic, they can be infected by a number of vacuolar pathogens, including the malaria parasitePlasmodium falciparum. We have previously shown that lipid and protein marker of rafts are drawn into the P. falciparumvacuole during the invasion and intraerythrocytic growth, while the dominant erythrocyte integral and cytoskeletal proteins are not (5Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Further, cholesterol is critical for maintaining the vacuole, but whether raft- cholesterol in the erythrocyte membrane is required for establishing malarial infection, and how this is influenced by GPI-anchored proteins is not known. In the present study, we show that DRM rafts from normal, uninfected erythrocyte plasma membranes contain a small but complex set of defined proteins and elevated cholesterol levels compared with non-raft regions of the plasma membrane. Selective depletion of raft-cholesterol disrupts all raft protein association, indicating that cholesterol is critical for all protein assembly into rafts. Loss of GPI-anchored proteins is associated with elevated cholesterol levels, but this does not increase raft association of proteins, suggesting that raft assembly does not require GPI-anchored proteins and that raft proteins do not bind directly to cholesterol. Further, although loss of rafts has no major effect on the shape, deformability, or transport properties of the erythrocyte, it can be correlated to inhibiting malarial infection, suggesting that rafts may provide specific functions of vacuolar uptake in the non-endocytic erythrocyte membrane. All chemicals were obtained from either Sigma or J. T. Baker Inc. unless indicated otherwise. Reagents were made using water prepared with the Nanopure system (Barnstead, Dubuque, IA), and pH values indicated were determined at room temperature. Asexual stages ofP. falciparum FCB or 3D7 strain were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% human serum in 5% CO2, at 37 °C, as described previously (16Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cultures were synchronized with 5% sorbitol (17Haldar K. Elmendorf H.G. Das A. Li W.L. Ferguson D.J. Elford B.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 221-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibody to CD59 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), Duffy (anti-Fy3), spectrin, actin, glycophorin A (all from Sigma), flotillin (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Duffy (anti-Fy6), Gαs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-globoside GL4 (Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA), anti-β2-adrenergic receptor (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), and FITC- or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary (goat) antibodies (Cappel, Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA). For flow cytometry and as indicated (see “Results”), mouse monoclonal antibody to CD59 directly conjugated to FITC was also used (PharMingen). Cell preparations were washed three times in RPMI 1640, resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml, and allowed to adhere to coverslips precoated with poly-l-lysine for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then fixed in 1% formaldehyde and washed once with PBS, pH 7.4, following which autofluorescence was quenched using 50 mm ammonium chloride in PBS. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin where indicated, blocked with 0.2% fish skin gelatin, followed by sequential incubation with the relevant primary antibody (diluted 1:100 to 1:500), and secondary antibody-conjugated to FITC, with three washes with PBS after each incubation. Parasite nuclei were stained with Hoechst 10 µl/ml or with ethidium bromide as indicated. Fluorescence microscopy and digital image collection were performed on an Olympus IX inverted fluorescence microscope and a Photometrix cooled CCD camera (CH350/LCCD) driven by DeltaVision software from Applied Precision Inc. (Seattle, WA) as described (5Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 200-nm optical sections were taken through the depth of the cell, and DeltaVision software (softWoRx) was used to deconvolve these images and construct three-dimensional volume views (18Hiraoka Y. Swedlow J.R. Paddy M.R. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 153-165PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitative projections, the “additive” method of data collection was used. Here, each ray collects and sums data from all of the voxels in its path and scales it down to an appropriate intensity. The data can be used for comparison of intensity in various structures within the image data. For CD59 and Duffy labeling, the concentrations of the primary and secondary antibodies were optimized by titrating empirically such that the fluorescence emission was linear over a 100-fold range of emission signal and such that the fluorescence detected with the parasite as well as the red cell were well within this range. Fluorescence quantification was carried out with a low magnification objective (× 40, NA 1.00) as well as with × 60, NA 1.4 and × 100 NA 1.35. Data from at least 200 individual infected red cells of mixed stages ranging from newly infected rings to mature schizonts in the process of rupturing were analyzed, and polygons were drawn to delineate the parasite and red cell. Background (or nonspecific) signal was subtracted by imaging areas that had no cells. Autofluorescence and nonspecific fluorescence levels were determined by viewing control samples with either primary or secondary antibody (but not both), obtained under the same illumination and exposure conditions. Total fluorescence intensity, areas, and pixel densities associated with the parasite and erythrocytes were determined in 0° projections of three-dimensional volume views. To determine the fluorescence internalized by the vacuolar parasite, we subtracted signal associated with the erythrocyte membrane above and below the parasite. To normalize for the variability in the amount of CD59 and Duffy found on uninfected erythrocytes, the data are represented as a fraction of the total cell-associated fluorescence internalized by the parasite as a function of hours of intraerythrocytic development. A minimum of at least 10 cells centered on a given parasite size were used to compute mean values and error bars shown in Fig. 7. Cholesterol depletion of cells and malarial infection was done as previously described (5Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 109 erythrocytes, washed free of serum, were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI medium containing 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, following which excess MBCD was washed, and cells were replated with 5% synchronized schizonts for 1 h in RPMI with 10% human serum (complete medium) at 37 °C, at the end of which ring parasitemia was scored by Giemsa stain. Control treatments contained RPMI alone or 5 mm MBCD complexed to cholesterol, which was prepared as described (19Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). A ring parasitemia of at least 5% in untreated, control cells was indicative of successful infection and formation of rings. Schizonts at the terminal stages of development (44–48 h) were purified over Percoll gradient, as described (17Haldar K. Elmendorf H.G. Das A. Li W.L. Ferguson D.J. Elford B.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 221-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), mixed with an over 100-fold excess of erythrocytes either from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients or normal controls, in 100 µl of cell pellets at 2% hematocrit. Following infection, 10–20 µl of erythrocyte pellet was taken out of the culture at various time points and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Cultures were routinely replenished with fresh PNH or normal erythrocyte pellet as the case may be to the same amount as that taken out for analysis. Thus, the erythrocyte pellet volume and hematocrit were maintained constant throughout the assay. Expression of CD59 (a marker for GPI-anchored proteins) on P. falciparum-infected and uninfected PNH cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. 10–20 µl of erythrocyte pellet (see above) was washed in PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated in 100 µl of PBS containing pretitered amounts of FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody to human CD59 for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed once with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min following which parasite nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (10 µl/ml) for an additional 15 min. The cell pellet was then washed once in PBS (pH 7.4). Samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan (FACSCalibur) within 2 h of immunofluorescence staining. Data were collected on a total of at least 50,000 light scatter gated events, gated to include erythrocyte population. Data were analyzed with CELLQuest software, and fluorescence histograms and dot plots were displayed on a four-decade logarithmic scale. Normal, MBCD-treated or PNH erythrocyte (type C; see Fig. 3) ghosts from 1 × 109 cells were prepared by hypotonic lysis (20Civenni G. Test S.T. Brodbeck U. Butikofer P. Blood. 1998; 91: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and extracted on ice in 1 ml of 1% Triton in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm EDTA and subjected to sucrose flotation gradient (3Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 12Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). After 30 min at 4 °C, the extract was mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose and then overlaid with 6 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose in Tris-buffered saline and subjected to ultracentrifugation in a SW41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C. The top 3 ml was collected as the first fraction. Proceeding down the gradient, fractions 2–6 were collected as 2-ml aliquots, and their protein concentrations were determined. If necessary, the proteins were concentrated by precipitation in acetone, and samples were subjected to electrophoresis by SDS-PAGE and probed with the appropriate antibodies in Western blots. For detection of proteins in SDS-PAGE gels, the gels were stained by either Coomassie Blue or silver stain. Protein assay kits (both the detergent-compatible and the Bradford assay) were from Bio-Rad. Cholesterol estimations were carried out, on chloroform-methanol extracts of hypotonically lysed erythrocyte membranes or aliquots of sucrose gradient fractions, using a Roche Molecular Biochemicals diagnostic kit (No.139050) and Amplex Red Cholesterol assay kit (A-12216) from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The former is a spectrophotometric assay in which cholesterol is converted to cholestenone with cholesterol oxidase. The Amplex Red Cholesterol assay is a sensitive fluorometric assay. The assay is based on an enzyme-coupled reaction that detects both free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters and was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Osmotic gradient ektacytometry was performed on mock and MBCD-treated human erythrocytes. Briefly, erythrocytes were continuously mixed with a 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone solution of gradually increasing osmolality (from 60 to 600 mosmol), and the deformability index is recorded as a function of osmolality at a constant applied shear stress of 170 dynes/cm2, using an ektacytometer (Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY). The maximum value of deformability index attained at physiologically relevant osmolality is quantitatively related to the mean surface area of the erythrocytes and to membrane deformability (21Clark M.R. Mohandas N. Shohet S.B. Blood. 1983; 61: 899-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell aliquots were also simultaneously assayed for invasion and DRMs. FITC-annexin V (Molecular Probes; catalog no. A13199) binding was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. A minimum of 100,000 events were collected and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Positive controls were conducted with erythrocyte ghosts prepared as described (20Civenni G. Test S.T. Brodbeck U. Butikofer P. Blood. 1998; 91: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in the presence of ionophore and calcium. Instrument settings were established using uninfected erythrocytes in the absence of annexin. In mammalian cells, a number of studies have shown that DRMs containing GPI-anchored proteins (expressed by transfection) and signaling proteins can be isolated from a variety of nucleated cells. In contrast, studies on the identification of DRM rafts from mature erythrocytes have been limited. Civenni et al. (20Civenni G. Test S.T. Brodbeck U. Butikofer P. Blood. 1998; 91: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) originally reported the presence of GPI-anchored proteins in detergent-resistant light membrane complexes isolated at 31% (w/v) sucrose. We have recently shown that detergent-resistant complexes with densities expected for rafts were enriched in GPI-anchored proteins (CD59, -58, and -55), a transmembrane heptahelical receptor such as Duffy, and heterotrimeric Gαs associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte membrane (5Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These DRM rafts were isolated on density gradients that comprise a bottom loading zone of 40% sucrose, overlaid with cushions of 35 and 5% sucrose (Fig.1 A). The 5–35% interface (fraction 2) is predicted to be highly enriched in DRM rafts, while the 40% sucrose zone reflects total cellular protein. To establish that the protein content of the DRM fraction is indeed unique and compare it with that of the whole cell lysate, fractions from the loading zone (40% sucrose) and the DRM rafts (5–35% interface) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig.1 B). As expected, the total protein content of the DRM fraction 2 is much reduced compared with fraction 6, as detected by silver staining. Despite this, the DRM fraction contains multiple protein bands. A heterogeneous band between 100 and 120 kDa is as prominent in the DRM fraction as in the loading zone. Further, multiple resolved protein bands between 60 and 70 kDa, between 30 and 40 kDa, at ∼22 kDa, and at ∼16 kDa also appear to be prominent and specific to fraction 2. Notably, major erythrocyte membrane bands corresponding to those of spectrin and ankyrin, band 3 and 4.1, as well as the major low molecular weight species seen in the loading zone (fraction 6) are conspicuously absent in fraction 2. These data confirm that the erythrocyte DRM fraction is truly enriched in a subset of proteins and shows a defined compositional content. As indicated earlier, we had previously shown that erythrocyte raft fractions are enriched in GPI-anchored proteins, the transmembrane Duffy antigen, and the signaling molecule Gs, but not glycophorin A (Ref. 5Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A). To further characterize them, we examined the distribution of additional raft markers. Stomatin and flotillin have been recently described as markers for rafts, and flotillin has been localized to caveolae (22Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Stomatin (31 kDa) was previously known to be present in erythrocytes (23Stewart G.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Monospecific antibodies to flotillin (45 kDa) confirmed its presence in erythrocytes (not shown). Western blots show that these proteins and earlier described markers are associated with DRM rafts found in fraction 2, which corresponds to the 5/35% sucrose interface containing light membrane rafts (Fig. 1 A). Our detection of signal in other fractions (fractions 3 and 4) suggests that DRMs may be heterogeneous. Bickel et al. (22Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) find a large proportion of flotillin in the light raft fraction. This may reflect differences in raft dynamics and/or the presence/absence of additional raft/caveolar proteins like caveolin (24Volonte D. Galbiati F. Li S. Nishiyama K. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12702-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, transmembrane proteins, such as the β-adrenergic receptor and aquaporin (CHIP), detected in either caveolae or DRMs when expressed in a variety of nucleated cells (25Page E. Winterfield J. Goings G. Bastawrous A. Upshaw-Earley J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1988-H2000PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H416-H422PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), are also enriched in fraction 2 (data not shown), confirming that plasma membrane DRMs from erythrocytes contain multiple transmembrane (as well as GPI-linked) proteins. We were unable to detect even low levels of major erythrocyte skeletal proteins such as spectrin and actin in DRM fractions, suggesting the absence of strong links between erythrocyte DRMs and these skeleton components. These data show that erythrocyte rafts have complex protein composition with several transmembrane receptors and virtually all of the heterotrimeric signaling protein Gs. Nonetheless, their overall protein content is low (∼4%) relative to the total membrane protein of the erythrocyte (Fig. 1 C and inset). Since cholesterol is known to be enriched in rafts and critical to their formation, we estimated how much was found in each gradient fraction. As shown in Fig. 1 C, ∼10% of the total cellular cholesterol is in the DRM fraction, leading to a ratio of 0.21 µg of cholesterol/µg of protein (Fig. 1 D). This is 7-fold higher than the cholesterol:protein ratio in the loading zone, where the ratio is 0.03 (Fig. 1 D). Cholesterol:protein ratios in the intermediate fractions 3–5 are comparable with the low values of the loading zone. These data show that DRMs are enriched in cholesterol relative to the rest of the plasma membrane. The amount of a protein or lipid isolated in DRMs at 4 °C may not accurately reflect the proportion in which it is found in dynamic rafts at 37 °C. However, since the liquid ordered state is favored at lower temperature, the cholesterol:protein ratios that we detect in isolated DRMs present an upper limit for these ratios in cells (for a review, see Ref. 28London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that cholesterol:protein ratios in rafts have the potential to increase by as much as 1 log, relative to that in non-raft domains of the plasma membrane. Taken together, the above data suggest that DRM and raft properties are conserved in cells and that erythrocytes may provide an unexpected, simplified model system in which to study plasma membrane rafts. Since cholesterol has been shown to play an important role in raft formation (10Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 28London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of its depletion on erythrocyte rafts. We depleted erythrocytes of surface cholesterol by treatment with MBCD, which results in a one-third reduction in cellular cholesterol levels (see “Experimental Procedures”) and subjected the cells to cold Triton X-100 extraction and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig.2 A)."
https://openalex.org/W1981526282,"In the Ascomycete fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the ratio of conidia (asexual spores) to ascospores (sexual spores) is affected by linoleic acid moieties including endogenous sporogenic factors called psi factors. Deletion ofodeA (ΔodeA), encoding a Δ-12 desaturase that converts oleic acid to linoleic acid, resulted in a strain depleted of polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:2 and 18:3) but increased in oleic acid (18:1) and total percent fatty acid content. Linoleic acid-derived psi factors were absent in this strain but oleic acid-derived psi factors were increased relative to wild type. The ΔodeA strain was reduced in conidial production and mycelial growth; these effects were most noticeable when cultures were grown at 26 °C in the dark. Under these environmental conditions, the ΔodeA strain was delayed in ascospore production but produced more ascospores than wild type over time. This suggests a role for oleic acid-derived psi factors in affecting the asexual to sexual spore ratio in A. nidulans. Fatty acid composition and spore development were also affected by veA, a gene previously shown to control light driven conidial and ascospore development. Taken together our results indicate an interaction betweenveA and odeA alleles for fatty acid metabolism and spore development in A. nidulans.

In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, linoleic acid-derived signal molecules called psi factors govern the development of cleistothecia (sexual bodies containing the sexual spores called ascospores) and conidiophores (asexual bodies producing the asexual spores called conidia) (5Champe S.P. Rao P. Chang A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1383-1388PubMed Google Scholar, 6Champe S.P. El-Zayat A.A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3982-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mazur P. Meyers H.V.

Commun. 1991; 1991: 1486-1487Crossref Google Scholar). Psi factor is a mixture of three hydroxylated linoleic molecules (PsiA1α, PsiB1α, and PsiC1α) and it has been reported that the proportion of these three compounds controls the ratio of asexual to sexual spore development in this fungus (5Champe S.P. Rao P. Chang A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1383-1388PubMed Google Scholar, 6Champe S.P. El-Zayat A.A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3982-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mazur P. Meyers H.V.

Commun. 1991; 1991: 1486-1487Crossref Google Scholar). Specifically, PsiB1α and PsiC1α are reported to stimulate sexual spore development whereas PsiA1α inhibits sexual spore development (6Champe S.P. El-Zayat A.A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3982-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxylated derivatives of oleic acid (PsiA1β, PsiB1β, and PsiC1β) have also been isolated fromA. nidulans (7Mazur P. Meyers H.V. Nakanishi K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 3837-3840Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Mazur P. Nakanishi K. El-Zayat A.A.E. Champe S.P. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1991; 1991: 1486-1487Crossref Google Scholar) but their role in sporulation has not been characterized. In addition to the effects of psi factor onAspergillus development, recent studies have also shown that purified linoleic acid and hydroperoxy linoleic acids derived from seed also exhibit sporogenic activities toward severalAspergillus spp. including A. nidulans and the seed infecting fungi Aspergillus flavusand Aspergillus parasiticus (9Calvo A.M. Hinze L.L. Gardner H.W. Keller N.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3668-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these species, the primary effect of linoleic acid and hydroperoxy linoleic acids was to induce precocious and increased conidial development. Lower concentrations of linoleic acid and 9(S)-hydroperoxy linoleic acid stimulated sexual spore development rather than conidial development in A. nidulans (9Calvo A.M. Hinze L.L. Gardner H.W. Keller N.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3668-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest a relationship between linoleic acid and/or its derivatives andAspergillus developmental processes. The sporogenic effects of linoleic acid, hydroperoxy linoleic acids, and psi factor were demonstrated on A. nidulans strains with an intact velvet (veA) locus (5Champe S.P. Rao P. Chang A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1383-1388PubMed Google Scholar, 9Calvo A.M. Hinze L.L. Gardner H.W. Keller N.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3668-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In A. nidulans veA strains, light delays and reduces sexual development and induces conidial production, while in the absence of light conidial production is repressed and the fungus develops cleistothecia (10Yager L.N. Bennett J.W. Klich M.A. Aspergillus: Biology, and Industrial Applications. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1992: 19-41Google Scholar). Strains with mutations in veA (veA1) exhibit light-independent development of conidia and ascospores (10Yager L.N. Bennett J.W. Klich M.A. Aspergillus: Biology, and Industrial Applications. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1992: 19-41Google Scholar). Furthermore, veA1 mutants do not develop spores in response to psi factor, linoleic acid, and other linoleic acid derivatives (5Champe S.P. Rao P. Chang A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1383-1388PubMed Google Scholar,9Calvo A.M. Hinze L.L. Gardner H.W. Keller N.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3668-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). veA locus was originally identified by Käfer in 1965 (11Käfer E. Genetics. 1965; 52: 217-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who also isolated the veA1 mutation.veA has been sequenced (accession numberU95045). 1L. Yager, personal communication. Currently the cellular function of VeA is not known. As a first step in understanding the molecular genetics of psi factor formation and psi factor effects on Aspergillus development, we deleted the odeA gene encoding an oleate Δ-12 desaturase, which catalyzes the conversion of oleic acid into linoleic acid. The effects of the odeA deletion were examined in bothveA and veA1 genetic backgrounds. The absence ofodeA changed the fatty acid profile, including the composition of psi factor, and raised total percent fatty acids/fungal tissue. Interestingly, veA also affected fatty acid composition. Detailed examination of psi factor levels in theveA strains at 26 °C indicated that, in comparison to the wild type, the ΔodeA strain was delayed in psi factor biosynthesis; however, higher amounts of psi factor were found over time. This was paralleled by delayed but increased ascospore production in this strain compared with wild type. The ΔodeA strain also displayed delayed and decreased conidial production compared with wild type in both veA and veA1 backgrounds. Interactions between odeA and veA affected spore development, fatty acid composition, and psi factor composition. A. nidulansstrains used in this study are listed in Table I. Cultures were grown on A. nidulans glucose minimal medium (GMM)2 unless otherwise indicated. GMM consists of 10 g of glucose, 6 g of NaNO3, 0.52 g of KCl, 0.52 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 1.52 g of KH2PO4, 1 ml of trace elements (2.2 g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 1.1 g of H3BO3, 0.5 g of MnCl2·4H2O, 0.5 g of FeSO4·7H2O, 0.16 g of CoCl2·5H2O, 0.16 g of CuSO4·5H2O, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 5 g of Na4EDTA in 100 ml of distilled H2O), in 1 liter of distilled H2O. pH was adjusted to 6.5 with a 10 n NaOH solution. Appropriate supplements corresponding to the auxotrophic markers were added to the medium (12Käfer E. Adv. Genet. 1977; 19: 33-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Agar (15 g/liter) was added to obtain solid medium. Temperature of incubation was 37 °C, unless indicated otherwise. Cultures were grown in continuous white light or in the dark. Cultures requiring white light were grown in an incubator equipped with General Electric 15-W broad-spectrum fluorescent light bulbs (F15T12CW) positioned at a distance of 20 cm from the agar surface, with a light intensity of 66 mE/m2/s.Table IFungal strain used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceFGCS26(biA1; vcA1)FGSC1-aFungal Genetics Stock Center (Kansas City, KS). veA, velvet gene; veA1, mutation in veA; odeA, delta-12 desaturase gene: ΔodeA, deletion of odeA; biA1, mutation inbiA causing biotin-deficient auxotrophy; argB2, mutation in argB causing arginine-deficient auxotrophy;pyroA4, mutation in pyroA causing pyridoxine-deficient auxotrophy; pabaA1, mutation inpabaA causing 4-aminobenzoic acid-deficient auxotrophy.FGSC89(biA1; argB2; veA1)FGSCTAMC31.65(biA1; veA1.

Open table in a new tab An A. nidulans cosmid library (pWE15, Fungal Genetics Stock Center, Kansas City, KS) and A. parasiticuscosmid library (pA1, provided by J. Linz, Ref. 13Skory C.D. Chang P.-K. Cary J. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 3527-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were screened using a putative Δ-12 desaturase gene from the yeast Candida albicans. The gene was contained in a 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment obtained from the plasmid pFAD4 (provided by J. Beckerman and P. MaGee). The screening of the A. parasiticus library yielded a cosmid, pAMC8, containing the putative Δ-12 desaturase gene. A 1.2-kb BamHI fragment from pAMC8 containing the carboxyl-terminal coding region of the A. parasiticus Δ-12 desaturase gene was used as a probe to screen the A. nidulans pWE15 genomic cosmid library, and a single cosmid, pWEO2H5, was obtained. Fragments from these cosmids were subcloned to facilitate sequencing and construction of transformation vectors. Fragments from the cosmid pWEO2H5 were subcloned into the plasmid pK19 (14Pridmore R.D. Gene ( Amst .). 1987; 56: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), obtaining pAMC15 (4.6-kbHindIII insert), pAMC16 (2.4-kb KpnI insert), pAMC17 (6-kb SalI insert), pAMC18 (1.8-kb BamHI insert), and pAMC19 (1.3-kb BamHI/HindIII insert). DNA sequencing of both strands was performed using synthetic primers and ABI PRISM DNA Sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Science). Sequences were assembled with the Sequencher 3.1 program. Nucleotide sequence was translated in all six reading frames using BLASTX 2.0.12 and compared with the sequences in GenBankTM (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). The GenBankTMsequence accession number of A. nidulans odeA isAF262955. The transformation vector utilized to delete odeA was called pAMC31.3. This plasmid included the argB marker gene and odeA flanking sequences without the odeA encoding region. pAMC31.3 was constructed as follows: first, the plasmid pAMC26.6 was obtained by insertion of a 7-kb SphI-XhoI fragment from pWEO2H5 into the SphI-SalI sites in pK19 (14Pridmore R.D. Gene ( Amst .). 1987; 56: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Another plasmid, pAMC29.1, was generated by digestion of pBlueScript SK− (Stratagene) with EcoRI and XhoI, followed by a blunt-end reaction and religation of the plasmid. A 4.3-kbSmaI fragment, containing the 1.3-kb odeAencoding region, was released from pAMC26.6 and ligated into theSmaI site in pAMC29.1 to create pAMC30.4. The entireodeA encoding region plus 389 base pairs downstream from the putative stop codon was then removed from pAMC30.4 by aSalI-NdeI double digest. This left two 1.3-kb genomic DNA fragments that were on either side of the excisedodeA gene. The remaining linear vector was blunt-ended and ligated to a blunt-ended 1.8-kb fragment containing the A. nidulans argB gene to obtain the final transformation vector pAMC31.3. Using standard procedures (16Miller B. Miller K. Timberlake W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), A. nidulans FGSC89 (biA1; argB2) (Table I) was transformed with pAMC31.3 to create TAMC31.65 (biA1; veA1,ΔodeA). Replacement of odeA by argBis denoted by the symbol ΔodeA. The ΔodeAallele was introduced in a veA background by sexual recombination of TAMC31.65 with WIM126 (pabaA1;veA). Ultimately, four isogenic strains differing only inveA and odeA alleles were created through transformation and sexual crosses (TableI). The transformation vector pAMC33.3 was used to complement the odeA deletion strain RAMC25 (pyroA4; veA1, ΔodeA). pAMC33.3 was constructed by inserting the 4.3-kb SmaI fragment from pAMC26.6 into pSM3 (which contains A. nidulans pyroA as a selectable marker, 17Yu J.H. Wieser J. Adams T.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5184-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 µg of genomic DNA from transformed A. nidulans strains were double digested withSalI/NdeI, and another 5 µg were digested withBamHI. Genomic DNA samples were separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and then transferred to Hybond membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary action. Gene replacement ofodeA with argB was confirmed by probing with a 1.7-kb SalI-NdeI fragment from pAMC30.4 and a 4.3-kb SmaI fragment from pAMC26.6. DNA was labeled with32P by random primer extension as described by Sambrook (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from mycelia by using Trizol as described by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 20 µg of total RNA were used for RNA blot analysis. Temperature and light effects on expression of odeA and theA. nidulans Δ-9 desaturase gene (sdeA) were analyzed by using A. nidulans veA1; veA1, ΔodeA; veA; and veA,ΔodeA strains. Inocula (106 conidia/ml) were grown in 3 ml of liquid GMM in 7-ml glass vials under stationary conditions for 72 h. Cultures were grown at 20, 26, 30, 37, and 40 °C in the dark. Light effects were observed in cultures grown at 37 °C. The 1.7-kb SalI-NdeI fragment containing the odeA encoding region and a sdeAcDNA fragment (an EST clone encoding the putative Δ-9 desaturase of A. nidulans, provided by Drs. B. Roe and D. Kupfer) were used as probes. Fatty acid feeding studies were carried out in the four near-isogenic strains (i.e. veA1; veA1, ΔodeA; veA; and veA, ΔodeA). Inocula (106 conidia/ml) were grown in 1-liter flasks containing 400 ml of liquid GMM at 37 °C and 300 rpm. After 16 h of growth, equal amounts of mycelia were transferred into GMM plus sodium linoleate, GMM plus sodium oleate, GMM, control minimum medium without glucose (MM) plus sodium linoleate, MM plus sodium oleate and MM. Sodium linoleate and sodium oleate (Sigma) were added to a final concentration of 1 mm in 1% Tergitol Nonidet P-40 (19McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Controls containing Tergitol, GMM plus Tergitol and MM plus Tergitol, were also included in the experiment. After 8 h the mycelia were harvested and processed for mRNA analysis. Conidial production studies were performed on plates containing GMM agar plus appropriate supplements that were spread with 100 µl of water containing 105conidia of veA1; veA1, ΔodeA; veA; andveA, ΔodeA strains. The cultures were incubated in the dark at 26 and 37 °C, and in the light at 37 °C. After 72 h, a core of 12.5-mm diameter was removed from each plate and homogenized in 2 ml of water to release the spores. Conidia were counted using a hemacytometer. Colony growth was recorded as colony diameter. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. The studies on sexual spore production were performed with theveA and veA, ΔodeA strains. The strains were inoculated on YGT medium, since this medium has been used in previous research to promote sexual development in A. nidulans (5Champe S.P. Rao P. Chang A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1383-1388PubMed Google Scholar, 6Champe S.P. El-Zayat A.A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3982-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Calvo A.M. Hinze L.L. Gardner H.W. Keller N.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3668-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five ml of melted 0.7% agar-YGT containing 106 conidia were poured on 30 ml of solid 1.5% agar-YGT and incubated in the dark at 26 and 37 °C, and in the light at 37 °C. After 10 days, a core of 12.5-mm diameter was removed from each plate and homogenized in 2 ml of water to release the spores. Ascospores were counted using a hemacytometer. The experiments were performed with four replicates. Additionally, in order to study the early stages of sexual development in the absence of odeA, a time course was carried out taking microscopic observations at 42, 66, 90, 114, 138, and 162 h after inoculation. Free ascospores and mature asci of veA and veA, ΔodeAstrains were counted at the 162-h time point following the procedure described above. veA1; veA1,ΔodeA; veA; and veA, ΔodeAstrains were incubated in 15 ml of liquid GMM in 8-cm diameter plates under stationary conditions at 37 °C in the light, 37 °C in the dark, or 26 °C in the dark. After 72 h, the mycelial mats were harvested and lyophilized to analyze FAME composition, including psi factors. Samples from veA and veA,ΔodeA on YGT medium were also analyzed at 42, 66, 114, 162, and 240 h for psi factor and FAME composition. Mycelia (56–134 mg) were sequentially extracted with two portions of 15 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) at −20 °C for a total of 4 days followed by extraction with 20 ml of ethyl acetate/methanol (1:1, v/v) for 4 h at room temperature with agitation. A known quantity of methyl nonadecanoate (19:0, NuChek Prep) was added to the combined extract of fungal lipids (19:0 was previously shown to be absent inAspergillus strains), and the extract was evaporated to dryness. The lipid residue was partitioned with 20 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (2:1:1, v/v/v), and the chloroform layer was collected and evaporated. The resultant lipid residue was saponified with 2 ml of 0.5 n NaOH in methanol at 65 °C for 30 min, after which the solution was acidified with 1 m oxalic acid. Free fatty acids extractable with chloroform after partition in chloroform/methanol/water (2:1:1, v/v/v) were methyl esterified with an excess of diazomethane in diethyl ether/methanol (9:1, v/v) for 2 min at room temperature. FAME recovered after solvent removal were partitioned with 6 ml of hexane/methanol (2:1, v/v), and 20 µg of internal standard ethyl ricinoleate (Sigma) was added for determination of hydroxy fatty acid methyl esters (HFAME). FAME were more selectively concentrated in the hexane layer, while HFAME were mainly extracted into the methanol layer. FAME, including the 19:0 internal standard, were analyzed by flame ionization detection-gas chromatography (FID-GC) by removing samples from the hexane layer. FID-GC was completed with a Spectra Physics Model SP-7100 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (0.25 mm × 25 m; film thickness, 0.25 mm; coated with a film of 007 CPS-2, J and S Scientific). The carrier flow was 1 ml/min, and the temperature programming was 100 to 180 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. After FAME analysis, the methanol layer from the hexane/methanol partition, containing HFAME, was recovered, and evaporated to dryness. The residue was treated with trimethylchlorosilane/hexamethyldisilazane/pyridine (3:2:2, v/v/v) to obtain trimethylsilyloxy (OTMSi) derivatives of the hydroxyl groups. After 15 min, the reagent was evaporated and 100 µl of hexane was added for analyses by FID-GC. OTMSi HFAME were analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard Model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detection using the internal standard OTMSi ethyl ricinoleate. The capillary column used was a SPB-1 (dimethyl polysiloxane phase, 0.32 mm × 30 m, film thickness 0.25 µm, Supelco). Temperature programming was from 160 to 260 °C at 5 °C/min with a hold at 260 °C for 5 min; the flow was 2 ml/min. The identity of the FID-GC peaks were confirmed by GC-MS using a Hewlett-Packard Model 5890 gas chromatograph interfaced with a model 5971 mass-selective detector operating at 70 ev. The capillary column utilized was a Hewlett-Packard HP-5MS cross-linked 5% phenylmethylsilicone (0.25 mm × 30 m, film thickness 0.25 µm). FAME were analyzed by temperature programming from 140 to 260 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min with a flow rate of 0.67 ml/min. HFAME were analyzed identically, except the temperature was programmed from 160 to 260 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min with a hold at 260 °C for 10 min. The identity of 8-hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoate (8-HOE), psiB1β, as its OTMSi ether was also confirmed by its isolation by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) followed by analyses by both GC-MS and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). 1H NMR was completed with a Bruker model ARX-400 spectrometer (400 MHz) using C2HCl3 as an internal standard and solvent. Lipid (as methyl ester/OTMSi ether derivative) from the ΔodeA strains was separated by TLC (Silica Gel 60 F254 plates, 20 cm × 20 cm × 0.25 mm, Merck) using solvent development with hexane/ethyl ether (9:1, v/v). After spraying the plate with 0.1% aqueous sodium 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonate, 8-HOE (methyl ester/OTMSi ether) was detected at R F = 0.41 by long-wave ultraviolet light. The scrapings containing 8-HOE (methyl ester/OTMSi ether) were eluted with ethyl acetate, and the solvent was removed for analysis. Chemical and sporulation data were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA). To compensate for the fact that the experimental design was not fully factorial (i.e.all possible combinations of temperature and illumination were not tested) each condition (26 °C dark, 37 °C dark, 37 °C light) was treated as an independent category within a single independent variable “environmental treatment.” For cases in which the main effect of environmental treatment was significant, single degree of freedom contrasts to test the specific hypotheses of the effect of temperature (37 °C dark versus 26 °C dark) and the effect of illumination (37 °C dark versus 37 °C light) were performed. Sequence analysis of A. nidulans odeA at both the nucleotide and amino acid level revealed high similarity with other Δ-12 desaturases from plants and fungi. OdeA contained the conserved His-rich regions found in other Δ-12 desaturases (data not shown) (20Sakamoto T. Wada H. Nishida I. Ohmori M. Murata N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Los D.A. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 22Sakuradani E. Kobayashi M. Ashikari T. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Deletion of odeA resulted in loss of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and alterations in spore production (described below). Transformation of the ΔodeAstrain with the odeA gene recovered the wild type phenotype as revealed by fatty acid analysis and physiological studies (data not shown). This supports the conclusion that the defects in the ΔodeA phenotype are solely due to loss of theodeA gene. Due to the extensive use of veA1 strains as research models throughout the international research community, theodeA deletion was placed in both a veA andveA1 genetic backgrounds, although our main interest was examining sporulation and psi factor composition in the veAstrains. Also, because fatty acid composition has been shown to change with temperature (23Murata N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Sakamoto T. Higashi S. Wada H. Murata N. Bryant D.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152 (b): 313-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fatty acid composition was compared in theveA; veA1; veA, ΔodeA; andveA1, ΔodeA strains at both 26 and 37 °C. Fatty acids were also examined under light and dark regimes at 37 °C due to the importance of light in conidial versus ascospore development in veA strains (10Yager L.N. Bennett J.W. Klich M.A. Aspergillus: Biology, and Industrial Applications. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1992: 19-41Google Scholar). Fatty acid composition was first examined under culture conditions known to promote asexual spore development (72 h growth and GMM medium). Table II shows the fatty acid composition of veA; veA1; veA,ΔodeA; and veA1, ΔodeA under the environmental conditions (treatments) tested. OdeAallele, veA allele, and treatment had a significant effect on fatty acid composition (p < 0.01). There was a near loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 18:2 and 18:3) in ΔodeA strains (Table II). Their presence was, however, confirmed independently by silver-ion HPLC followed by GC-MS of the HPLC-purified FAME (not shown). To determine whether these low levels of PUFA were of fungal or exogenous origin in the ΔodeAstrains, GMM medium was examined for the presence of linoleic acid. The medium contained trace amounts of linoleic acid (0.8 µg), but this amount was negligible in comparison to the total amount found in ΔodeA mycelia (average of 23 µg/culture). Levels of other fatty acids also changed in ΔodeA mycelia (TableII). For example, the percentage of saturated fatty acids, palmitic acid (16:0), and stearic acid (18:0) was reduced. In addition, the total percentage of FAME per g of mycelium was approximately 2–3-fold higher in the ΔodeA strains. These effects were conserved independently of veA or veA1 alleles, illumination regimens and temperature (Table II).Table IIFatty acid composition of mycelia of ΔodeA and wild type in veA1 and veA genetic backgroundsSample% FAME*Wt % of individual FAME16:018:018:118:218:3OthersveA1 26D2.43 ± 0.0913.1 ± 0.213.6 ± 0.114.5 ± 0.348.4 ± 0.58.03 ± 0.362.40 ± 0.08veA1, ΔodeA26D5.68 ± 0.055.53 ± 0.0710.4 ± 0.180.8 ± 0.30.68 ± 0.07TR2-bTR, trace (below integration threshold).2.59 ± 0.09veA 26D2.71 ± 0.1712.7 ± 0.115.2 ± 0.622.0 ± 0.743.1 ± 0.63.32 ± 0.243.59 ± 1.07veA, ΔodeA26D6.40 ± 0.356.02 ± 0.1910.7 ± 0.679.1 ± 0.40.62 ± 0.08TR3.63 ± 0.43veA1 37D1.81 ± 0.1615.4 ± 0.068.90 ± 0.1915.0 ± 0.355.7 ± 0.21.77 ± 0.133.18 ± 0.44veA1, ΔodeA 37D5.64 ± 0.068.77 ± 0.206.46 ± 0.4681.4 ± 0.40.47 ± 0.05ND2-cND, not detected.2.89 ± 0.04veA 37D2.38 ± 0.0916.0 ± 0.39.42 ± 0.4623.7 ± 0.946.5 ± 1.00.46 ± 0.123.88 ± 0.12veA, ΔodeA 37D5.32 ± 0.379.25 ± 0.057.24 ± 0.1779.7 ± 0.50.39 ± 0.08ND3.43 ± 0.28veA1 37L2.06 ± 0.2016.7 ± 0.17.34 ± 0.7916.1 ± 0.155.0 ± 1.30.60 ± 0.044.02 ± 0.19veA1, ΔodeA37L4.84 ± 0.218.62 ± 0.484.99 ± 0.6283.0 ± 1.30.30 ± 0.06ND3.04 ± 0.16veA 37L2.07 ± 0.2215.6 ± 0.38.46 ± 0.8922.9 ± 1.049.4 ± 1.30.28 ± 0.073.35 ± 0.30veA, ΔodeA 37L5.16 ± 0.209.37 ± 0.136.17 ± 0.1280.7 ± 0.20.48 ± 0.16ND3.24 ± 0.08The analysis was carried out on 72-h old mycelia grown in liquid glucose minimum med"

However, the molecular events that lead to ubiquitin conjugation to these cell surface molecules have not been defined. Here we report that Cbl, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, promotes ubiquitination of TCRζ chain, which requires its functional variant Src homology 2 domain and an intact RING finger. The tyrosine kinase Zap-70, which binds to both TCRζ and Cbl, plays an adaptor role in these events. Mutations in TCRζ, Zap-70, or Cbl that disrupt the interaction between TCRζ and Zap-70 or between Zap-70 and Cbl reduce ubiquitination of TCRζ. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which Cbl negatively regulates T cell development and activation by inducing ubiquitination of the TCR·CD3 components.

Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 2Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The TCR is assembled as a multiple subunit complex that consists of the specific antigen-binding TCR α and β heterodimer, signal-transducing invariant CD3γ, δ, ε chains, and the structurally distinct TCRζ chain. The signal capacity of the CD3 subunits and TCRζ chain is achieved through the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), characterized by the presence of a pair of YXX(L/I) sequences separated by 6–8 variable amino acids. Each CD3 subunit has one copy, and TCRζ chain has three copies of ITAMs. Engagement of the TCR induces rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the ITAMs through the activation of the Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) Lck and Fyn. The tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAMs in CD3 subunits and TCRζ chain creates the binding sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the Syk family PTKs Syk and Zap-70, resulting in their subsequent recruitment and activation. The activated PTKs in turn propagate activation signals by phosphorylating multiple intracellular proteins, eventually leading to T cell activation. Of note is the fact that biochemical and genetic studies have documented a critical role for the TCRζ chain in transducing the signaling processes (3Love P.E. Shores E.W. Immunity. 2000; 12: 591-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which is further supported by the formation of TCRζ chain clustering in the T cell- antigen presenting cell interface during T cell recognition (4Krummel M.F. Sjaastad M.D. Wulfing C. Davis M.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Engagement of the TCR by the peptide-MHC complex or anti-TCR·CD3 antibodies also results in down-regulation of the TCR·CD3 complex (5Viola A. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1996; 273: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 6Valitutti S. Muller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of the TCR·CD3 complex is considered a self-limiting factor to terminate a sustained signaling in T cell-antigen presenting cell conjugates and is also proposed to be responsible for unresponsiveness and/or tolerance induction of the self-reactive T cells (8Pantaleo G. Olive D. Poggi A. Pozzan T. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Schonrich G. Kalinke U. Momburg F. Malissen M. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Malissen B. Hammerling G.J. Arnold B. Cell. 1991; 65: 293-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Among all potential pathways leading to TCR·CD3 down-regulation, ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation to the TCR·CD3 subunits, and particularly to the TCRζ chain, has been shown in activated T cells (10Cenciarelli C. Hou D. Hsu K.C. Rellahan B.L. Wiest D.L. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Weissman A.M. Science. 1992; 257: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of TCRζ chain occurs in response to TCR triggering, upon treatment with a phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, and is inhibited by the PTK inhibitor herbimycin (11Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Multiple lysine residues in the intracellular domain of TCRζ chain are potential sites for Ub attachment (12Hou D. Cenciarelli C. Jensen J.P. Nguygen H.B. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14244-14247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying TCRζ chain ubiquitination remains unclear. Ubiquitination of a protein substrate occurs via a covalent isopeptide bond formation between the C-terminal glycine of Ub and the ε-amino group of lysine residues of the substrate and involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions of E1, E2, and E3 (13Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). Ub is activated first by an activating enzyme (E1) to form a high energy thiolester bond between Ub and E1 and is then transferred to a conjugating enzyme (E2). The E3s or Ub- protein ligases are the components responsible for specific substrate recognition and for promoting Ub ligation to the target protein. Therefore, the E3s can provide specificity to the Ub system. Ubiquitination of cell surface receptors represents a general mechanism of turning off signal transduction induced by the ligand binding (15Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Particularly, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the receptors for epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and colony-stimulating factor-1 go through ubiquitination upon receptor engagement, and this Ub conjugation process involves Cbl, an adaptor protein (16Miyake S.

Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Cbl, a 120-kDa proto-oncogene product, was originally isolated as a cellular homologue of v-Cbl, a part of the transforming fusion protein of CAS NS-1 retrovirus causing leukemia in mice (19Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. d. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Cbl consists of an N-terminal variant SH2 domain, a RING finger, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain with potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Indeed, genetic and biochemical studies have shown that Cbl family proteins including those fromDrosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans attenuate intracellular signaling induced by the engagement of cell surface receptors (20Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is now understood that Cbl functions as an E3 Ub ligase with a RING finger that recruits a Ub-conjugating enzyme or E2 and an SH2 domain that recognizes activated receptor tyrosine kinases for Ub conjugation (18Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y.

Two genetic studies using Cbl gene-targeted mice showed that the cell surface expression of the TCR·CD3 complex is up-regulated in Cbl-deficient thymocytes (24Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G. Venter D.J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15547-15552Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for Cbl in T cell development and activation. The fact that TCRζ chain is ubiquitinated and that Cbl acts as a RING-type E3 ligase for receptor tyrosine kinases prompted us to investigate whether Cbl also functions as an E3 for TCRζ chain to promote its ubiquitination. Here we show that Cbl indeed induces Ub conjugation to TCRζ chain, which requires a functional RING finger and the N-terminal variant SH2 domain of Cbl. Furthermore, mutations of TCRζ ITAMs reduce its ubiquitination, whereas coexpression of Zap-70 enhances the event. Significantly, it is shown that Zap-70 plays an adaptor role in Cbl-induced Ub conjugation to TCRζ chain. Our results provide a molecular mechanism by which Cbl regulates T cell function by promoting ubiquitination of TCRζ chain. Polyclonal anti-Cbl, anti-TCRζ chain, anti-Zap-70 antibodies, anti-Myc, and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Zap-70 monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Xpress antibody was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Anti-human CD3ε (OKT3) monoclonal antibody was purified from ascites using a protein G-Sepharose column. Anti-TCRζ monoclonal antibody (H146-968) was provided by R. Kubo. The human TCRζ chain cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a human lymphocyte cDNA library (CLONTECH) as the template and was subcloned into a pEF vector with an in-frame Myc epitope tag at the 3′-end. A truncated mutant with the second half of the second ITAM and the third ITAM removed (TCRζ 1–121) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pEF vector. Point mutations at the N-terminal tyrosine residue to phenylalanine at each of the three ITAMs in wild-type TCRζ (AYF, ABYF, ABCYF) or TCRζ 1–121 (AYF), or lysines 115 and 117 mutated to arginine in TCRζ 1–121 (TCRζ 1–121KR), were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene). The human Zap-70 cDNA was subcloned into pEF without or with an Xpress epitope. Point mutations at tyrosine 292 to phenylalanine in Zap-70 were made by site-directed mutagenesis. The HA epitope-tagged Ub cDNA has been described (26Fang D. Wang H.-Y. Fang N. Altman Y. Elly C. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4872-4878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol.

The Cbl cDNAs encoding the full-length Cbl or Cbl G306E without or with an HA epitope in the pEF vector were described previously (28Deckert M. Elly C. Altman A. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8867-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A Cbl construct containing the N-terminal variant SH2 domain and the RING finger (SH2+RING, amino acids 1–481), or the RING finger and C-terminal proline-rich domain (RING+C, amino acids 355–906) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pEFneo with an HA epitope at the 5′-end. Mutations at glutamic acid 369 to alanine (E369A), cysteine 381 to alanine (C381A), and tryptophan 408 to alanine (W408A) in the full-length Cbl or in Cbl 1–481 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Jurkat T cells or a Zap-70-deficient Jurkat T cell line (P116; kindly provided by Dr. Bob Abraham, Duke University, Durham, NC) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For protein expression in Jurkat T cells, cells were transfected with the appropriate amount of plasmids (usually 1–10 µg total) by electroporation (240 V, 960 microfarads; Bio-Rad). 293T kidney embryonic cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For protein expression in 293T cells, cells were transfected with the appropriate amount of plasmids (usually 1–4 µg total) by calcium precipitation. After 48 h, cells were collected, resuspended (2 × 107/ml) in 0.5 ml of medium, and treated with pervanadate, OKT3, or MG132 (50 µm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaPiP, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 10 µg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). Cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g(4 °C for 10 min). For displaying ubiquitinated protein bands, 0.1% SDS was added into lysis buffer to disrupt nonspecific protein-protein interaction. For immunoprecipitation, lysates (∼1 × 107 cells) were mixed with antibodies (1 µg) for 2 h followed by the addition of 30 µl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and boiled in 20 µl of 2× Laemmli's buffer. Samples were subjected to 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with the indicated primary antibodies (usually 1 µg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Membranes were then washed and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When necessary, membranes were stripped by incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.7, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) for 1 h at 70 °C with constant agitation, washed, and then reprobed with other antibodies as indicated. Previous studies have shown that the TCR components including the TCRζ chain undergo activation-dependent ubiquitination (10Cenciarelli C. Hou D. Hsu K.C. Rellahan B.L. Wiest D.L. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Weissman A.M. Science. 1992; 257: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The present study was made to determine the molecular events underlying Ub conjugation to TCRζ. As the first step, we tried to establish anin vivo system in which TCRζ can be properly ubiquitinated. For this purpose, TCRζ chain tagged with a Myc epitope at the C terminus was expressed in Jurkat T cells in the absence or presence of HA-tagged Ub. The cells were left untreated or were treated with pervanadate, a phosphatase inhibitor, or with both pervanadate and MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-HA. Coexpression of HA-Ub with TCRζ resulted in the formation of a slow migrating, higher molecular weight smear that was recognized by anti-HA antibody (Fig.1 a, top panel). Treatment of the cells with pervanadate increased Ub conjugation to TCRζ, and that was further enhanced by the presence of both pervanadate and MG132. To eliminate the interference of nonspecific co-precipitation of other proteins, we added 0.1% SDS in the lysis buffer. The same membrane was reprobed with anti-Myc antibody, showing equivalent amounts of TCRζ expression among all the samples (Fig. 1 a, bottom panel). The recent identification of Cbl as a RING-type E3 Ub-protein ligase (21Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine whether Cbl can promote ubiquitination of TCRζ. Jurkat T cells were cotransfected with TCRζ and HA-Ub plasmids in the absence or presence of Cbl plasmid. Coexpression of Cbl with TCRζ significantly augmented Ub conjugation to TCRζ, which was further enhanced by pervanadate treatment (Fig. 1 b). The results suggest that TCRζ can act as a substrate for Cbl E3 Ub ligase in T cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that TCR cross-linking with OKT3 could also induce TCRζ ubiquitination (10Cenciarelli C. Hou D. Hsu K.C. Rellahan B.L. Wiest D.L. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Weissman A.M. Science. 1992; 257: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To examine whether Ub conjugation to TCRζ could be induced under OKT3-stimulated conditions in our system, T cells transfected with TCRζ and Cbl were left unstimulated or stimulated with OKT3 or pervanadate. OKT3 stimulation indeed augmented Ub conjugation to TCRζ, although to a lesser degree than with pervanadate stimulation (Fig.1 c). The data were consistent with previous publications (10Cenciarelli C. Hou D. Hsu K.C. Rellahan B.L. Wiest D.L. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Weissman A.M. Science. 1992; 257: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that TCRζ ubiquitination occurs under physiologic stimulation conditions. We have previously shown that mutation at cysteine 381 to alanine (C381A) of Cbl RING finger can disrupt the interaction of Cbl with Ubc E2 and ablate its ligase activity in an in vitro system (21Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Cbl C381A mutant on TCRζ ubiquitination, we coexpressed TCRζ with wild-type Cbl or Cbl C381A mutant. Consistent with our in vitro study, the mutation at cysteine 381 to alanine abrogated Cbl-induced Ub conjugation to TCRζ under both resting and pervanadate-stimulated conditions (Fig. 2 a). A recent crystal structure study on Cbl·UbcH7 complex showed that besides the Cbl RING finger, which contains the primary binding sites for Ubc E2, a link region between the N-terminal variant SH2 domain and the RING finger, also forms contact sites with UbcH7 (23Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Of note, the glutamic acids 366 and 369 form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with UbcH7 arginine 15 and arginine 5, respectively. To investigate the role of this linker region in Cbl E3 ligase activity toward TCRζ ubiquitination, we generated a point mutation at glutamic acid 369 to alanine in Cbl and coexpressed with TCRζ. As compared with wild-type Cbl, the E369A mutant reduced its ability to induce TCRζ ubiquitination under both resting and pervanadate-stimulated conditions (Fig. 2 b). The RING fingers of Cbl family proteins contain a well conserved tryptophan residue (Trp-408), and mutation at this residue to alanine (W408A) reduces its binding to Ubc E2 and eliminates its ligase activity in vitro (21Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). To further confirm the importance of the Cbl RING finger in Ub conjugation to TCRζ, we also coexpressed the W408A mutant with TCRζ. In agreement with our in vitrodata (21Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), the W408A mutant severely reduced TCRζ ubiquitination under resting and pervanadate-treated conditions (Fig. 2 b). Taken together, the results indicate that an intact RING finger and the linker region are required for Cbl to promote TCRζ ubiquitination. Cbl consists of an N-terminal variant SH2 domain, a RING finger, and C-terminal proline-rich sequences (20Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We next examined the functional requirement of each domain in Cbl for the Ub conjugation to TCRζ. Truncated Cbl constructs containing Cbl variant SH2 domain and the RING finger (SH2+RING), or the RING finger and the C-terminal portion (RING+C) were generated and coexpressed with TCRζ. The SH2+RING mutant induced Ub conjugation to TCRζ to a similar degree as wild-type Cbl (Fig. 3 a), under resting and pervanadate-stimulated conditions. However, the RING+C mutant showed markedly reduced ability to promote TCRζ ubiquitination, in comparison with either wild-type Cbl or the SH2+RING mutant. We then tested whether the RING finger mutation at cysteine 381 to alanine in the SH2+RING mutant has an effect on TCRζ ubiquitination. As compared with Cbl SH2+RING, the C381A mutant showed reduced ability in inducing Ub conjugation to TCRζ (Fig.3 b). The data collectively suggest that the N-terminal SH2 domain and the RING finger are primarily responsible for TCRζ ubiquitination. The E3 ligases are the components in the Ub system that mediate substrate recognition, in addition to their role in the recruitment of Ub-loaded E2, and help transfer Ub to the substrate and subsequent polyubiquitination (13Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). Because Cbl is not known to associate directly with TCRζ, an intermediate or adaptor molecule would be required for Cbl to form an indirect complex with TCRζ and to transfer Ub to TCRζ. The importance of the Cbl N-terminal SH2 domain as demonstrated above may suggest that the putative adaptor molecule can interact with the variant SH2 domain and also with TCRζ. One of the potential molecules for this role is Zap-70, because it is the well characterized protein that binds to Cbl variant SH2 domian (20Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and also to TCRζ (Zap-70, or ζ chain-associated protein-70 as it was originally named) (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possibility of whether Zap-70 has any effect on TCRζ ubiquitination. Coexpression of Zap-70 with TCRζ enhanced Ub conjugation to TCRζ under resting conditions, and TCRζ ubiquitination was further enhanced by pervanadate stimulation (Fig.4 a). We next assessed whether Zap-70 could further augment the Cbl-mediated effect on TCRζ ubiquitination. Ub conjugation to TCRζ was indeed increased by coexpression of Cbl and Zap-70 under both resting and pervanadate-stimulated conditions (Fig. 4 b, lanes 4 and 10). Previous studies have showed that tyrosine 292 in Zap-70 is the binding site for the Cbl variant SH2 domain and that mutation at this site to phenylalanine can disrupt its interaction with Cbl (20Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of this mutation on TCRζ ubiquitination. As compared with wild-type Zap-70, Zap-70 Y292F mutant showed a reduced ability to cooperate with Cbl to induce Ub conjugation to TCRζ (Fig. 4 b, lanes 6 and12), although substantial level of TCRζ ubiquitination remained. Previous studies have documented that a loss-of-function mutation in Cbl glycine 306 to glutamic acid (G306E) can also disrupt its interaction with Zap-70 (20Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The effect of this mutation on TCRζ ubiquitination was assessed by coexpressing TCRζ with either the SH2+RING or its G306E mutant. The G306E mutant markedly lost its ability to induce TCRζ ubiquitination as compared with the SH2+RING (Fig. 4 c). To further confirm an adaptor's role for Zap-70 in Cbl-induced ubiquitination of TCRζ, we employed a Zap-70-deficient non-lymphoid 293T cells. The cells were transfected with plasmids containing HA-Ub, TCRζ, and Cbl in the absence or the presence of Zap-70 plasmid. Unlike in Jurkat T cells, Cbl alone induced Ub conjugation to TCRζ only slightly in 293T cells (Fig. 4 d). However, coexpression of Cbl with Zap-70 markedly augmented ubiquitination of TCRζ. The data collectively suggest that Zap-70 can act as an adaptor for Cbl to induce Ub transfer to TCRζ. The TCR·CD3 complex including TCRζ undergoes Ub conjugation in an activation-dependent manner (Refs. 10Cenciarelli C. Hou D. Hsu K.C. Rellahan B.L. Wiest D.L. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Weissman A.M. Science. 1992; 257: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar and 11Cenciarelli C. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Guo A. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8709-8713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and the present study). To further dissect the molecular events underlying Cbl-promoted ubiquitination of TCRζ, we generated a series of point mutations at the tyrosine residues of the three ITAMs on TCRζ and analyzed the effect of these mutations on TCRζ ubiquitination. Mutation at a single tyrosine residue to phenylalanine at the first ITAM (denoted as AYF) or a double mutation at the first two ITAMs (ABYF) affected Ub conjugation to TCRζ to a certain degree, although these effects were variable among different mutants (Fig. 5 a). Significantly, a mutation with all of the three ITAMs mutated (ABCYF) showed a marked reduction in TCRζ ubiquitination under both resting and pervanadate-stimulated conditions. We then analyzed the effect of these mutations on the interaction with Zap-70. Jurkat T cells coexpressed with Zap-70 and the TCRζ mutants were left unstimulated or stimulated with pervanadate. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Zap-70. Of all the TCRζ mutants, only the ABCYF mutant completely disrupted the binding to Zap-70 (Fig. 5 b). To further assess the role of TCRζ ITAMs in its ubiquitination, we examined the effect of the ABCYF mutant in the presence of Zap-70 or Cbl. The Zap-70-induced Ub conjugation to TCRζ was severely reduced in the ABCYF mutant (Fig. 5 c). Similarly, the same mutation also reduced Cbl-mediated ubiquitination as compared with wild-type TCRζ (Fig. 5 d). Collectively, the data suggest that any of three ITAMs on TCRζ can mediate Zap-70 interaction and the subsequent Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of TCRζ. We then focused on the first ITAM of TCRζ to analyze its role in the Ub conjugation process. A previous study has shown that Ub conjugation to TCRζ chain occurs in multiple intracellular lysine residues (12Hou D. Cenciarelli C. Jensen J.P. Nguygen H.B. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14244-14247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the TCRζ 1–121 mutant, there are five lysine residues in the intracellular portion, whereas in the 1–121KR mutant, the last two lysine residues were mutated to arginines. We first examined whether the truncated mutants could be ubiquitinated. The 1–121 and the 1–121KR mutants displayed similar or slightly reduced Ub conjugation as compared with the full-length TCRζ under resting and pervanadate-stimulated conditions (Fig.6 a). Next, the effect of Cbl on their ubiquitination was analyzed by coexpressing Cbl and the full-length TCRζ or the truncated mutants. Under resting conditions, Cbl induced Ub conjugation to both the full-length TCRζ and the truncated mutants to a similar degree, a"

When the innermost capsid protein VP2 is expressed in the baculovirus-insect cell system it assembles as core-like particles.

Morphologically and biochemically, the capsid consists of three concentric layers. The outermost layer in the infectious virus is composed of the glycoprotein VP7 and the hemagglutinin spike protein VP4. The intermediate capsid layer is composed of trimers of VP6 organized on a T = 13 icosahedral lattice (1Prasad B.V. Wang G.J. Clerx J.P. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The innermost capsid layer is composed of 120 molecules of a 102-kDa protein (VP2) and encloses the genomic dsRNA (2Labbé M. Charpilienne A. Crawford S.E. Estes M.K. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2946-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VP2 binds to viral RNA, and its nucleic acid binding domain is located between amino acids (aa)1 1 and 132 (3Labbé M. Baudoux P. Charpilienne A. Poncet D. Cohen J. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3423-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The bond between Gln-92 and Lys-93 in VP2 is a protease-accessible site (4Zeng C.Q. Labbe M. Cohen J. Prasad B.V. Chen D. Ramig R.F. Estes M.K. Virology. 1994; 201: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been shown that coexpression of capsid viral proteins in the baculovirus system results in the assembly of virus-like particles (VLP) (2Labbé M. Charpilienne A. Crawford S.E. Estes M.K.

Zhou Y.J. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5922-5945Crossref Google Scholar). VLP are stable, and when they include the spike protein, they share several properties with infectious virus including cell binding, α sarcine coentry, activation of NF-κB, and cell fusion from without (5Crawford S.E.

In general molecules carried by VLP are small (12Gilbert S.C. Plebanski M. Harris S.J. Allsopp C.E. Thomas R. Layton G.T. Hill A.V. Nat.

However, three chimeric VLP have been constructed with exceptionally large inserts; they are papillomavirus VLP containing E7 and E2 of the same virus (14Greenstone H.L. Nieland J.D. de Visser K.E.

To our knowledge a limited number of native virus particles have been conjugated by chemical grafting to a fluorescent dye including reovirus (17Georgi A. Mottola H.C. Warner A. Fields B. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6579-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and influenza virus (18Yoshimura A. Ohnishi S. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These labeled virions exhibit a decrease in their specific infectivity but can be visualized in living cells. In the rotavirus model, the amino terminus region of VP2 is dispensable for assembly of VLP, and the deletion of the first 92 amino acids of VP2 resulted in the formation of pseudo-core particles (Δ92VLP2). Complexes of the two enzymes VP1 and VP3, which are involved in the transcription of the genome within the intact particle, are anchored to the inner surface of VP2 at the icosahedral vertices (19Prasad B.V. Rothnagel R. Zeng C.Q. Lawton J.A. Chiu W. Estes M.K. Nature. 1996; 382: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Analysis of Δ92VLP2 suggests that the amino termini are clustered around the 12 icosahedral vertices, with the RNA binding domains facing inward (20Lawton J.A. Zeng C.Q.Y. Mukherjee S.K. Cohen J. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V.V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7353-7360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On this basis we reasoned that the addition of a large protein domain at the amino terminus could fit into the space occupied by the VP1-VP3 complex and by the genome in the virus particle. We hypothesized that the addition of much larger inserts than those previously added to chimeric VLP might be tolerated. Accordingly, we prepared two chimeric VP2 in which amino acids 1–92 are replaced either by the entire 238-aa GFP or by the entire 249-aa DsRed protein (21Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar), both followed by a flexible linker. This addition did not affect assembly of double and triple layered VLP. Moreover a single VLP can be detected by fluorescent microscopy. This is the first report of VLP with a long exogenous polypeptide enclosed within. These chimeric particles allow to study the first steps of rotavirus infection. The plasmid pBS2C24Δ (22Zeng C.Q.Y. Estes M.K. Charpilienne A. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 201-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), constructed for the expression of VP2 with the first 92 amino acids deleted, was modified to remove the extra methionine. The linker TCTAGAGGATCC was added to provide an XbaI site and a flexible linker, consisting of the amino acids SRGS between VP2 and the fused protein. This fragment was then subcloned in pVL1392 (Invitrogen) and the recombinant plasmid named pVL1392JA16. The GFP gene was recovered from pEGFPC1 (CLONTECH) and ligated into pVL1392JA16. Recombinant plasmids were sequenced to determine the integrity of the GFP insert and of the linker. The recombinant clone containing the GFP in the proper orientation was named pVLJA16PEGFPC1. Similarly, DsRed fluorescent protein that consists of 249 residues (28 kDa) (CLONTECH) (23Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11984-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) (21Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar) was fused to Δ92VP2, but the transfer vector was pFastbac instead of pVL1392. To generate the recombinant baculovirus expressing GFP fused to Δ92VP2, a mixture of 2 µg of purified transfer vector DNA plus 500 ng of linearized parental baculovirus DNA AcRP6SC (24Kitts P.A. Ayres M.D. Possee R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) was added toSpodoptera frugiperda clone 9 (Sf9) insect cells in the presence of the transfection reagent. The recombinant baculovirus expressing DsRed-Δ92VP2 was obtained with the Bac to Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.) Recombinant baculoviruses were plaque-purified, and selected viruses were referred to as GFPJA16 and DsRedJA16. Four different VLP containing full-length VP2 and VP6 (VLP2/6), Δ92VP2 and VP6 (Δ92VLP2/6), GFP-Δ92VP2 and VP6 (GFP-VLP2/6), or DsRed-Δ92VP2 and VP6 (DsRed-VLP2/6) were produced in the baculovirus expression system as described earlier (2Labbé M. Charpilienne A. Crawford S.E. Estes M.K. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2946-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly Sf9 cells were coinfected with two baculoviruses expressing VP6 and an authentic or a modified VP2 at a multiplicity of infection higher than 5 plaque-forming units/cell, collected 5–7 days post-infection, and then treated with Freon 113, purified by density gradient centrifugation in CsCl. The concentration of protein in the purified VLP suspension was estimated by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard. Usually the final preparation has a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. Because the calculated molecular weight of GFP-VLP2/6 is 5 × 107, a 1-mg/ml suspension contains 1.2 × 1013 particles/ml. Coinfections with recombinant baculovirus expressing GFP-Δ92VP2, VP6, VP7 (BVP7 A459RD; see Ref. 25Franco M.A. Prieto I. Labbe M. Poncet D. Borras-Cuesta F. Cohen J. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2579-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and VP4 (BVP4 expressing the VP4 of the bovine strain RF) 2J. Cohen, unpublished data. produced three layered particles with VP4 spikes (GFP-VLP2/6/7/4) and were purified by the same method. Confocal microscopic analysis was carried out using the TCS SP1 confocal imaging system (Leica Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany), equipped with a × 63 objective (numerical aperture = 1.4). The signal was integrated over four to eight frames to reduce the noise. For calibration purpose we used FluoSpheres® carboxylate-modified red fluorescent microspheres, 0.1 µm (2.7 × 1013 particles/ml), purchased from Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands. For visualization of VLP entry a mixture of DsRed-VLP2/6 and trypsinized GFP-VLP2/6/7/4 was absorbed on MA104 cells for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with serum-free medium, shifted for various time lengths at 37 °C, and finally fixed with 2% para-formaldehyde. Untrypsinized GFP-VLP2/6/7/4 were used in control experiments. Time lapse experiments were carried out on human dendritic cells prepared as described (26Canque B. Camus S. Dalloul A. Kahn E. Yagello M. Dezutter-Dambuyant C. Schmitt D. Schmitt C. Gluckman J.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and generously provided by J. C. Gluckman (INSERM, EMI 00-13, Hôpital Saint-Antoine, Paris). They were used after 48 h of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor treatment to promote a dendritic differentiation. VLP-GFP (either VLP2/6 or VLP2/6/7/4) were added to the cells at time zero, together with 0.1 µm of red FluoSpheres®. To control their ability to enter the cells, GFP-VLP were trypsinized (1 µg/ml for 15 min at room temperature) before addition. Time lapse capture was performed using the software provided by Leica (Scanware, Version 1.6.587). At each time, 5 sections, 0.5 mm each, encompassing the whole depth of the cells, were recorded with two consecutive accumulated passes during which both the green and the red channel were captured, together with the transmitted light. Cells were recorded every 30 s for a total duration of 30 min. The five sections of each channel (green and red) at each time were projected to give an image that corresponds to the sum of all the volume at a given time. The resulting data were animated using NIH image software (version 1.6.1). Specimens for electron microscopy were prepared from the appropriate CsCl gradient fractions containing GFP-VLP2/6 or VLP2/6. For cryo-electron microscopy frozen hydrated specimens were prepared on holy carbon grids as described previously (27Hewat E.A. Blaas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Samples of the VLP suspension were applied to grids, blotted immediately with filter paper for 1–2 s, and rapidly plunged into liquid ethane. Specimens were photographed at a temperature of close to −180 °C using a Gatan 626 cryo-holder in a Phillips CM200 operating at 200 kV. Defocus image pairs were obtained under low dose conditions (<10 electrons/Å2) at a nominal magnification of × 38,000 at underfocus values ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 µm. Micrographs were digitized using an Optonics microdensitometer with a pixel size of 12.5 µm corresponding to a nominal pixel size of 4.30 Å. Image analysis was performed on a Silicon Graphic Incorporated using the ICOS program suite (28Fuller S.D. Butcher S.J. Cheng R.H. Baker T.S. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The common lines method (29Crowther R.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1971; 261: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) was used for the initial determination of particle origins and orientations in the VLP2/6 micrograph. The polar Fourier transform model-based method (30Baker T. Cheng R.H. J. Struct.

The VLP2/6 reconstruction was computed to 18 Å using 76 particles, and the GFP-VLP2/6 reconstruction was computed to 19 Å using 79 particles. Only information before the first zero of the contrast transfer function was used. Fourier ring correlation was used to estimate the resolution (31Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsci. 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE analysis (12.5% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS) the Laemmli system (32Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was used, and proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Aliquots from CsCl gradient fractions were loaded onto 0.8% (w/v.) agarose gels in MOPS-Tris buffer, pH 6.6, and were run at 5 V/cm (33Ruiz M.C. Charpilienne A. Liprandi F. Gajardo R. Michelangeli F. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4877-4883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleic acids and GFP-VLP were visualized by illumination at 310 nm. For immunization, 100 µg of CsCl gradient-purified GFP-VLP2/6 were injected twice (days 0 and 21) intraperitoneally into mice with Freund's adjuvant. The final serum was collected 7 days after the boost and assayed on COS-7 cells transfected with pEGFPC1 plasmid by indirect immunofluorescence using Alexa 588-labeled anti-mice secondary antibody. For demonstrating the feasibility of rotavirus “nanoboxes” we constructed chimeric VLP that assemble as well as normal VLP and contain 120 copies of a functional protein inside the VLP, fused to VP2. GFP appeared to be an ideal model insert, because its fluorescence depends on proper folding. To minimize steric constraints, an SRGS linker was added at the carboxyl end of GFP. After electrophoretic analysis and Coomassie Blue staining, visible bands of apparent molecular masses of 80, 92, and 110 kDa were detected in the extracts of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing Δ92VP2, VP2, and GFP-Δ92, respectively (Fig.1, lanes 2–4). The apparent molecular weight of the band observed in cell infected with GFPJA16 baculovirus corresponds to the expected size for the chimeric Δ92VP2 protein fused to GFP. This was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-VP2 monoclonal and a commercial anti-GFP serum (data not shown). To test for the assembly of VLP made of chimeric VP2, we coexpressed GFP-Δ92VP2 or DsRed-Δ92VP2 with VP6 and purified the possible VLP by density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig.2 bands corresponding to Δ92VLP2/6 and fluorescent VLP2/6 were similar when illuminated with white light, but only bands corresponding to GFP-VLP (or DsRed-VLP) were visible under UV light. As determined by PAGE, the CsCl gradient band contained VP6 and either GFP-VP2 or VP2 (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6) or VP6 and DsRed-VP2 (not shown). The stoichiometry of VP6 and the chimeric VP2 (or authentic VP2) was similar in all types of VLP and in virus particles. Electron microscopy of negatively stained (not shown) and frozen hydrated preparations revealed the presence of morphologically identical VLP in gradients (Fig.3).Figure 3Cryo-electron micrographs of frozen hydrated rotavirus VLP2/6 (A) and GFP-VLP2/6 (B). The scale bar represents 20 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The assembly was also tested, by comparing the electrophoretic migration in native agarose gels of GFP-VLP2/6 and authentic VLP2/6 with viral double layered particles (DLP) and triple layered particles (TLP). The RNA present in DLP and TLP was stained red with ethidium bromide, and it was possible to visualize a green-colored band corresponding to GFP-VLP (Fig. 4). In this electrophoresis system the migration rate depend on the size and on the charge of the objects (thus on the presence of RNA in DLP). Because DLP and VLP2/6 have the same diameter the green band migrated close to the band corresponding to DLP. Spectrophotometry measurements were performed to evaluate the proper folding of the inserted GFP molecules. We measured the absorbency at 488 nm of purified GFP (CLONTECH) and purified GFP-VLP, and we calculated the molar extinction coefficient. As expected native GFP exhibits a strong absorbency in the visible range with a maximum at 488 nm and a molar extinction coefficient ofE M = 53000m−1·cm−1 (34Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Sharif W.D. Kain S.R. Piston D.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients of GFP-VLP at 488 nm varied betweenE M =50600 and 55250m−1·cm−1. This result indicated that all GFP molecules (120 molecules per VLP) contained the authentic chromophore and that spacing between the GFP chromophores had no quenching effects. Hence, at least 95% of the GFP domains in the particulate chimeric protein are properly folded. Cryo-electron micrographs of GFP-VLP2/6 and VLP2/6 are indistinguishable by eye (Fig. 3), and their three-dimensional reconstructions reveal an identical morphology seen from the outside (Fig. 5, A and B). However, differences are visible in the interior of the capsid on and around the 5-fold icosahedral axes. In the GFP-VLP2/6 density map there is additional density compared with the VLP2/6 map inside the capsid on each of the 5-fold axes (Fig. 5 C). Also there are five zones of missing density roughly 7 nm from the 5-fold axis (Fig.5, D–F). Difference maps between GFP-VLP2/6 and VLP2/6 show that these differences are well above the noise level. It is now well established from cryo-electron microscopy of rotavirus (20Lawton J.A. Zeng C.Q.Y. Mukherjee S.K. Cohen J. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V.V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7353-7360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and orthoreovirus (35Hill C.L. Booth T.F. Prasad B.V. Grimes J.M. Mertens P.P. Sutton G.C. Stuart D.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the crystallographic structure of the core of bluetongue virus (36Grimes J.M. Burroughs J.N. Gouet P. Diprose J.M. Malby R. Zientara S. Mertens P.P.C. Stuart D.I. Nature. 1998; 395: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), that the VP2 (or the VP2 equivalent) of all these viruses are arranged as 60 dimers on a T = 1 icosahedral lattice. The amino termini of each VP2 of the dimer are located inside the capsid with one very close to the 5-fold axis and the second at a distance roughly 7 nm from the 5-fold axis. Thus we are able to interpret the missing density in the GFP-VLP2/6 as the missing 92 amino acids. This is in agreement with the difference maps of Δ92VLP2/6 and VLP2/6 determined by Prasad and colleagues (20Lawton J.A. Zeng C.Q.Y. Mukherjee S.K. Cohen J. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V.V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7353-7360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We interpret the additional density on the 5-fold as representing five GFP molecules that are only partially ordered and thus only partially visible. VP2 is located inside the virus particle and inside the VLP; however, immunization with VLP2/6 induces a clear antibody response to VP2 (37O'Neal C.M. Crawford S.E. Estes M.K. Conner M.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8707-8717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of the chimeric particles to induce antibodies against native GFP, mice were immunized with the purified particles. Preimmune and hyperimmune sera were tested by indirect immunofluorescence on COS cells transfected with a plasmid containing the gene of GFP under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Diluted hyperimmune serum revealed by an Alexa-conjugated anti-mouse antiserum lead to a clear staining of cells expressing GFP (Fig. 6). With a standard microscope, observation of a 1 mg/ml suspension of fluorescent VLP revealed faint spots that looked like stars in the Milky Way (not shown). At the confocal microscope level, the detection of GFP-VLP (or DsRed-VLP) was much easier, and individual green (or red) spots could be identified (Fig. 7 A). Increasing the illumination intensity made the individual spot brighter but did not reveal new spots. This suggested that each spot corresponds to a single VLP and that sources dimmer than a single VLP spot were not present. The intensity of spots was fairly homogenous with some exceptions that could correspond to small aggregates. To confirm that most of the spots corresponded to a single VLP we observed a mix of 100 nm in diameter red fluorescent latex beads and GFP-VLP. The concentration of latex beads and VLP were both adjusted to 3.109/ml. It appeared that the number of red and green spots was of the same magnitude (Fig.7 B). Assuming that beads and VLP bind as efficiently on the glass this confirmed that most of the green spots corresponded to a single VLP. Addition of antibody to GFP-VLP lead to specific aggregation depending on the nature of the outer protein of the VLP; GFP-VLP2/6 and GFP-VLP2/6/7/4 are aggregated by RV138 and 7/7 directed against VP6 and VP4, respectively (Fig. 7, C–F). It has been shown previously that VLP containing the spike protein VP4 bind to permissive cells (5Crawford S.E. Labbé M. Cohen J. Burroughs M.H. Zhou Y.J. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5922-5945Crossref Google Scholar). To examine whether fluorescent VLP were also competent for entry, we first incubated MA104 cells with a mix of DsRed-VLP2/6 and GFP-VLP2/6/7/4. After 30 min of adsorption at 4 °C, cells were washed, shifted to 37 °C, and further incubated for 15 or 30 min to allow the penetration of VLP. When GFP-VLP2/6/7/4 were not trypsinized (Fig. 8 A) both types of VLP were retained at the cell surfaces as confirmed by vertical x-z section (Fig. 8 B). In contrast with trypsinized GFP-VLP2/6/7/4, the green signal strongly decreased indicating that these VLP entered the cells, whereas DsRed-VLP2/6 were still detected at the cell surface (Fig. 8, C and D). It could be noted that despite extensive washing, fluorescent DsRed-VLP2/6 that do not present the viral attachment protein (VP4) remained at the cell surface. To explore the interactions between VLP and professional antigen-presenting cells we incubated VLP with living human dendritic cells (at room temperature) for 30 min, and images were recorded every 30 s. A majority of nontrypsinized GFP-VLP2/6/7/4 were not internalized during the experiment (not shown). When trypsinized GFP-VLP2/6/7/4 were used, two main phenomenons were observed. As shown on Fig. 9 (and in the video that can be downloaded at http://www.jbc.org), some VLP seemed to move along extensions of dendritic cells toward the cell body. They appeared to roll on the cell surface, as confirmed by the analysis of individual sections, which showed that these VLP were present on the outermost optical sections. In the meantime, other VLP, associated with the cell body surface from the beginning of the experiment, move less actively and seemed to disappear after 15 min, suggesting that they are rapidly internalized. Presented data show that it is possible to fuse a protein to the amino terminus of rotavirus VP2 deleted of the first 92 amino acids, without altering the autoassembly property of VP2. Particles that we obtained have the same diameter as authentic VLP, and their outer surface is not modified, because VP6 assembles on the modified VP2 particles as well as it assembles on the native VP2. After addition of VP6, the outer layer of the viral capsid consisting of VP7 and VP4 can also assemble. The production of fluorescent particles indicates that the individual constituents of the chimeric protein are properly folded, because both particle formation and fluorescence depend on a native three-dimensional structure. Direct evidence for the formation of capsid-like particles containing GFP was obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction, revealing the presence of particles with the same T = 1 and T = 13 architecture as observed previously for authentic VLP (19Prasad B.V. Rothnagel R. Zeng C.Q. Lawton J.A. Chiu W. Estes M.K. Nature. 1996; 382: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20Lawton J.A. Zeng C.Q.Y. Mukherjee S.K. Cohen J. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V.V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7353-7360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using difference map analysis to compare structures of GFP-VLP2/6 and VLP2/6 we have defined the probable locations of the GFP within the core. The GFP molecules are only partially visible on the 5-fold axis and not at the expected positions off axis. The 4-aa flexible linker apparently allows the GFP to move about quite freely, which means that they are lost in the averaging inherent in the three-dimensional reconstruction except on 5-fold axis where they have restricted movement because of the close proximity of the five on axis GFP. Whereas the insertion of small peptides into virus and virus-like particles is a long established practice, the insertion capacity appeared to be limited (13Sedlik C. Saron M. Sarraseca J. Casal I. Leclerc C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7503-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), because long inserts appear to affect folding of capsid proteins. For example when the hepatitis B virus preS2 region (amino acid residues 1–48) is fused upstream to, and collinear with, the amino terminus of bluetongue virus VP7 protein (preS2-VP7) core assembly is possible only if a fraction of this protein is chimeric, the outer shell being a mixture of normal and chimeric molecules of VP7 (38Belyaev A.S. Roy P. Virology. 1992; 190: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two types of VLP, derived from hepatitis B virus core and from papillomavirus, have been amenable to large addition or insertion. For HBV core particles, the exogenous protein (GFP) is inserted into the 76–83 loop and is surface-exposed (16Kratz P.A. Bottcher B. Nassal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Papillomavirus VLP containing E7 or E2 proteins from the same virus are more comparable with the VLP described here, because extra polypeptides correspond to entire proteins and project into the interior of the empty capsid (14Greenstone H.L. Nieland J.D. de Visser K.E. De Bruijn M.L. Kirnbauer R. Roden R.B. Lowy D.R. Kast W.M. Schiller J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates that a complete foreign protein of about 250 aa can be present in multiple copies inside a chimeric rotavirus capsid. The connection between GFP and VP2 must not sterically hinder formation of the final structure. Apparently, the flexible linker at the end of GFP meets this requirement. Hence, we believe that the native display of other proteins (or protein domains) of the size of GFP and possibly larger can be accomplished. This view is supported by preliminary evidence showing that addition of chameleon GFP (643-aa-long; see Ref. 39Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), a fragment of the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (261 aa), and VP8* of rotavirus (241 aa) do not inhibit particle formation. An intriguing perspective for structural studies is that proteins fused inside rotavirus VLP might become amenable to high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy analyses. This possibility was investigated for the hepatitis B virus VLP with a GFP insert on the outside of the capsid (16Kratz P.A. Bottcher B. Nassal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the hepatitis B VLP construction, GFP was inserted at the tip of the external spike with two linking regions. In that case GFP was clearly visible in the cryo-EM images, but the three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that GFP was only partially ordered. Optimizing the flanking linker sequences to allow rigid fixing of the foreign protein domains to the surface such that they adopt well defined positions while allowing normal VLP formation is clearly the key to this approach. One of the major interests of fluorescent rotavirus VLP is to enable the first direct observation of VLP interactions with living cells. Indeed we were able to follow in real time the internalization of fluorescent VLP on two cell types, namely human dendritic and monkey MA104 cells. In addition we were able to compare in the same experiment the fate of entry-competent (trypsinized VLP2/6/7/4; green) and entry-incompetent (VLP2/6; red) particles. Surprisingly, shortly after entry, trypsinized VLP 2/6/7/4 were no longer detectable. This could be because of either the fact that the internalized particles reached an acidic compartment in which fluorescence was quenched (endosomes and/or lysosomes) (34Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Sharif W.D. Kain S.R. Piston D.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) and/or because of the disruption of the VLP into smaller objects not detectable at the optical microscope level. It has been shown previously that VP2 is completely inside VLP2/6 (20Lawton J.A. Zeng C.Q.Y. Mukherjee S.K. Cohen J. Estes M.K. Prasad B.V.V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7353-7360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that immunization of mice with VLP2/6 induces antibodies against VP2 (37O'Neal C.M. Crawford S.E. Estes M.K. Conner M.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8707-8717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus not surprising that the chimeric particles efficiently induced antibodies against native epitopes of the protein graft located inside the VLP. This suggests that both chimeric and authentic VLP present their inner components to the immune system following degradation that occurs after inoculation. One advantage of rotavirus VLP as a transport system is their ability to enter target cells through the recognition of host cell receptors followed by specific viral uptake mechanisms (5Crawford S.E. Labbé M. Cohen J. Burroughs M.H. Zhou Y.J. Estes M.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5922-5945Crossref Google Scholar). In conclusion, we demonstrated the possibility of producing recombinant chimeric rotavirus VLP with a properly folded protein within. Addition of the outer capsid proteins is possible, and therefore, such complete VLP imitate natural viruses and could be used as a transport system for cell-specific drug delivery. Several approaches have been investigated to improve the oral bioavailability of bioactive peptides and proteins. Among them, the use of VLP delivery systems represents a promising concept, particularly when VLP are derived from a virus of the gastrointestinal tract. Packaging peptides and proteins in particles should provide added protection of these molecules against degradation and, in some cases, also enhance their absorption. Other specific applications of the fluorescent VLP might be to follow the intracellular trafficking of authentic VLP or virus and also to trace the fate of virus particles in the environment after administration to a complete organism.

Using ER as bait, the yeast two-hybrid screen of the cDNA library derived from Tam-resistant breast tumors was utilized to identify novel ER-interacting proteins. A 0.8-kilobase open reading frame DNA fragment obtained from this screen showed 100% identity with the C-terminal one-third of FKHR (amino acids 402–629), a member of the HNF3/FKH transcription factor family (22Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 23Shapiro D.N. Sublett J.E. Li B. Downing J.R. Naeve C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 108-112Google Scholar). The sequence of FKHR protein exhibits certain interesting features (22Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1A, the protein contains at its N terminus a forkhead domain that is highly homologous among the HNF3/FKH family and is necessary for DNA binding, and at its C terminus a proline-rich and acidic serine/threonine-rich transactivation domain (AD). Other motifs in FKHR include an SH3 binding site and an alanine-rich region that has been associated with transcriptional repression in other proteins. FKHR and two other closely related members, FKHRL1 and AFX (41Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden C.K. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 42Borkhardt A. Repp R. Haas O.A. Leis T. Harbott J. Kreuder J. Hammermann J. Henn T. Lampert F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), are relatively divergent from other HNF3/FKH family members both within and outside the forkhead region. As shown in Fig. 1 B, their forkhead domain lacks the N-terminal KPPY motif common to most HNF3/FKH family genes and contains a novel 5-amino acid insert (DKGDS) instead. Interestingly, at their C termini an NR-interacting domain or LXXLL motif (Fig.1 A, NID) (43Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 45McInernery E.M.

The interaction between FKHR and ER was defined further using the yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. In the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2A), in the presence of E2, co-expression of two chimeric proteins (GAL4 AD-FKHR (amino acids 402–629) and GAL4 DBD-hERα) resulted in good cell growth on selection medium, and the colonies turned blue within 1 h in the β-gal filter lift assay (Fig. 2 A, E2), whereas a minimal growth was seen either in the absence of ligand (Fig. 2 A, No ligand) or the presence of anti-estrogen (Fig. 2 A, Tam). Surviving colonies in the absence of ligand or with Tam did not turn blue within 16 h in a β-gal filter lift assay. In the GST pull-down assay, FKHR only weakly interacted with ER both in the absence of hormone (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) and the presence of Tam (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). E2treatment enhanced the interaction by 2–3-fold (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). GST alone did not interact with FKHR even in the presence of E2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 5), indicating the specific interaction between ER and FKHR. As reported previously (9Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Taneer M.M. Guan X. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 10Chen H. Lin R.J. Schitz R.L.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), the known ER-interacting protein AIB1 interacted with ER only in the presence of E2 (Fig. 2 B,lane 8). Taken together these results suggest that FKHR is an ER-interacting protein that preferentially associates with E2-bound ER. The ligand-dependent interaction between FKHR and ER suggests a potential role for FKHR as an ER coregulator. Therefore, we tested whether FKHR can directly affect ER transactivation by cotransfection of FKHR and ER along with reporters driven by either an artificial ERE promoter (Fig. 2 C) or a natural ERE promoter (Fig. 2 D) into mammalian cells. In both cases, co-expression of ER and FKHR into HepG2 cells repressed 2–3-fold the transcriptional activity of the reporter in the presence of E2 in a dose-dependent manner. A similar result was obtained in COS-1 cells (data not shown). A slight repression of reporter activity was also observed in the absence of ligand and the presence of Tam, which could be either caused by residual E2 in the medium or the weak interaction of ER and FKHR under those conditions. Alternatively, FKHR could act as a general transcriptional repressor. However, the transcriptional activity of the CMV-β-gal (used as an internal control) was not significantly affected (data not shown), and the repression was observed only when the ER was cotransfected (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the repression is receptor-dependent. To exclude the possibility that FKHR may down-regulate ER, we measured ER protein levels in cells transfected with various amounts of FKHR. No difference in ER protein levels was found (data not shown), indicating that the repressive effect of FKHR on ER-mediated transactivation is not caused by ER down-regulation. To test whether FKHR can counteract the activator activity mediated by other known coactivators, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a constant amount of the AIB1 expression plasmid along with increasing amounts of FKHR (Fig.3A) or vice versa (Fig.3 B). As reported previously (9Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Taneer M.M. Guan X. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), the transient transfection of AIB1 resulted in a 2-fold enhancement of ER-mediated transactivation, confirming its ER coactivator activity. Cotransfection of increasing amounts of FKHR along with AIB1 resulted in a dose-dependent repression of AIB1-enhanced ER-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3 A). Conversely, cotransfection of increasing amounts of AIB1 along with a constant amount of FKHR gradually reversed the repressive effect of FKHR on ER-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3 B). These data demonstrate that FKHR and AIB1 antagonize the effects of each other on ER-mediated transactivation. To investigate whether the repressor activity of FKHR is limited to ER, we examined the effect of FKHR on other NRs. Similar to ER, cotransfection of FKHR resulted in a gradual repression of PR- and GR-mediated transactivation (Fig. 4,A and B), and this effect was solely observed in cells cotransfected with the receptor and treated with their cognate ligands. In addition, FKHR interacted with two nonsteroid NRs: GST-RAR and GST-TR (Fig. 4 C). However, unlike ER, FKHR bound to TR and RAR both in the absence and presence of their cognate ligands, indicating the ligand independence of the interaction. In contrast to steroid receptors, cotransfection of FKHR resulted in 2–3-fold stimulation, rather than repression, of RAR- and TR-mediated transactivation both in the absence and presence of their cognate ligands (Fig. 4, D and E). To determine the physiologic relevance of the interaction of FKHR with ER, we tested the effect of FKHR on the growth of an estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Using a single colony reduction assay (Fig.5A), we observed that empty vector-transfected cells had a significantly different distribution in the cell number per colony or cluster than FHKR-transfected cells (p < 0.0001). Clusters containing single cells or doublets were much more common in cells transfected with FKHR, whereas clusters containing more than 10 cells were common in control dishes (Fig. 5 A). This difference in colony size is more apparent when comparing the median cell number per colony for pcDNA-transfected cells (seven cells/colony) with the FKHR-transfected cells (two cells/colony). In the colony reduction assay (Fig. 5 B), in comparison with vector alone, overexpression of FKHR greatly reduced colony formation (50% reduction). Similarly, overexpression of p21, a known negative regulator for cell growth, resulted in a 70% reduction of colony formation (40Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Finally, Western blot analysis revealed the differential expression pattern of FKHR in different human tissues (Fig.6). FKHR is expressed in most of the tissues tested with higher levels in ovaries and testes and intermediate levels in brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and skeletal muscle. There is very low FKHR expression in lungs and no detectable levels in placenta and spleen. Interestingly, there is a doublet band in muscle (heart and skeletal muscle) but not in other tissues tested, although we do not know currently the nature of this doublet. The tissue differences in FKHR protein levels may play a role in tissue specificity of NR-mediated responses to various hormones or antihormones. We have shown that FKHR interacts with several members of the NR superfamily including ER, RAR, and TR, although the effect of ligand on this interaction varies by receptor type. Its interaction with ER is enhanced by estrogen, whereas its interaction with TR and RAR is ligand-independent. The characteristic features of the interaction of FKHR with ER compared with TR and RAR are similar to those described for the previously described NR intermediary protein NSD1 (19Huang N. Baur E.V. Garnier J. Lerouge T. Vonesch J. Lutz Y. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3398-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The two distinct NR-interacting domains identified in NSD1 could be also present in FKHR. Alternatively, the different binding features of FKHR could also reside within the structure of the NRs themselves. As mentioned, steroid and nonsteroid receptors show distinct features in their DNA binding and dimerization and in their effects on the basal transcriptional activity of target genes. First, steroid receptors form homodimers in their active state, whereas nonsteroid receptors heterodimerize with RXR upon the addition of ligand. Conceivably, FKHR could interact differently with homodimer versus heterodimer partners. Second, unliganded steroid receptors are complexed with chaperone proteins and remain in an inactive state, whereas unliganded nonsteroid receptors are bound to DNA and are complexed with corepressors, resulting in the repression of basal transcription of target genes. FKHR could bind with different affinities and/or mechanisms to DNA-bound versus free NRs. Because there is no DNA or promoter present in our in vitro assay, the interaction seen in vitro may not necessarily reflect thein vivo situation. In addition to its different binding properties with steroid and nonsteroid NRs, FKHR differentially regulates the transactivation mediated by different NRs. Co-expression of FKHR in mammalian cells (HepG2 and COS-1) dramatically represses transactivation mediated by ER, PR, and GR. In contrast, FKHR stimulates rather than represses transactivation mediated by RAR and TR. The differential effects of FKHR on the transactivation of different NRs might be explained by the presence of both coactivation and corepression domains in the FKHR molecule, as described for NSD1 (19Huang N. Baur E.V. Garnier J. Lerouge T. Vonesch J. Lutz Y. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3398-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the FKHR gene has shown a transactivation domain at its C terminus as well as a repression region at its N terminus (22Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Binding to different receptor types could result in conformational changes, exposing either the transactivation or repression domains of FKHR. In addition, homodimers and heterodimers of NRs might recruit different sets of transcriptional components that might then be differentially regulated by FKHR. Finally, because its regulatory function depends on the nature of the receptor, it is possible that FKHR activates transcription functions of TR and RAR by either sequestering TR- and RAR-specific corepressors or blocking the histone deacetylase activity associated with these corepressors. Further experiments are required to address these possibilities. The HNF3/FKH transcription factor family has been implicated in diverse biological functions varying from embryonic development to adult tissue-specific gene expression (46Barr F.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 47Hromas R. Costa R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 20: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 48Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In addition, variants of several genes of this family (especially the FKHR subfamily) have shown oncogenic potential (46Barr F.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 49Scheidler S. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Barr F.G. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FKHR was originally cloned from a rhabdomyosarcoma because of its aberrant fusion with another transcription factor, PAX3, resulting from a unique chromosomal translocation t(2;13) (22Galili N.

Little is known about the underlying mechanism of this transformation process (55Bennicelli J.L. Edwards R.H. Barr F.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Characterization of FKHR as an NR transcriptional intermediary protein should provide clues about the biological function of FKHR and possibly the oncogenic mechanism of PAX3-FKHR. It is possible that the chromosomal translocation in rhabdomyosarcoma results in not only the activation of PAX3 but also disruption of functional FKHR, which may be essential for RAR-dependent muscle cell differentiation. This loss of a differentiation function of FKHR, rather than a gain of function by the PAX3-FKHR fusion, could conceivably contribute to the development of rhabdomyosarcoma. In addition, FKHR has been shown recently to play a role in several signal transduction pathways (24Tomizawa M. Kumaro A. Perrot V. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. J. Biol.

These data implicate a role for XIAP in TGF-β-mediated signaling that is distinct from its anti-apoptotic functions. inhibitor of apoptosis protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein glutathione S-transferase transforming growth factor-β transforming growth factor-β type I receptor hemagglutinin baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 fetal bovine serum dominant negative plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 tumor necrosis factor receptor Eagle's medium containing Earle's salts Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium c-Jun N-terminal kinase nuclear factor κB tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-binding protein 1 bone morphogenetic protein Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays a critical role during development and tissue homeostasis, and also serves to remove damaged or extraneous cells from an organism (1Kerr J.F.

Apoptotic cells undergo a regulated autodigestion, which involves the disruption of cytoskeletal integrity, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and the activation of endonucleases. The chief effectors of the apoptotic cell death pathway are the caspase family of cysteine proteases. Caspases are synthesized as inactive precursors that are cleaved at specific aspartate residues to generate the active subunits. Zymogen cleavage can occur by several mechanisms including proximity-induced autoprocessing or cleavage by other caspases, revealing a caspase cascade with upstream initiator caspases such as caspases -8, -9, and -10 and downstream, effector caspases, such as caspases-3, -6, and -7 (4Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar, 5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). The activity of these caspases is regulated by several families of both pro- and anti-apoptotic cellular proteins including the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)1 proteins (6Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The IAPs were first discovered in the genomes of baculoviruses, where they were found to maintain viability of virus infected cells and thus enhance virus replication (7Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Miller L.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Certain baculovirus IAPs can function in mammalian cells to suppress apoptosis (9Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Van Dongen J.L. Gilfillan M.C. Shiels H. Hardwick J.M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2685-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 10Hawkins C.J. Uren A.G. Häcker G. Medcalf R.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13786-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), andIAP-related genes have subsequently been identified in many metazoan genomes (11Uren A.G. Coulson E.J. Vaux D.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation. IAPs are defined by a domain of ∼70 amino acids known as the baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) (7Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Uren A.G. Coulson E.J. Vaux D.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Members of the IAP family contain one to three imperfect BIR repeats arranged in tandem. These BIR domains are required for the ability of IAPs to suppress apoptosis, and have been shown to bind caspases directly (6Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The mammalian IAP family (6Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar) includes c-IAP1, c-IAP2, X-linked IAP (XIAP), neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP), survivin, BRUCE, and ML-IAP (12Vucic D. Stennicke H.R. Pisabarro M.T. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1359-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Of these, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP exhibit the most structural homology, possessing three tandem BIR repeats and a C-terminal RING finger, which is involved in ubiquitin conjugation (13Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). XIAP (14Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.-E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), also known as ILP (9Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Van Dongen J.L. Gilfillan M.C. Shiels H. Hardwick J.M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2685-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), or MIHA (15Uren A. Pakusch M. Hawkins C. Puls K.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), is a broad-ranging suppressor of apoptosis (14Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.-E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 16Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). XIAP has been shown to bind to and directly inhibit the activity of specific caspases (17Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 18Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). However, emerging data suggest that the cellular activities of XIAP are not limited to caspase binding and inhibition. A previous report (19Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W.M. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) implicated XIAP in the regulation of the stress-induced kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Similarly, XIAP has recently been identified as an activator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates expression of a range of acute phase and immediate-early genes (20Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Stehlik C. Binder B.R. Lipp J. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22064-22068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Other members of the IAP family have also been implicated in signal transduction. For example, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 associate with the type 2 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR2) signaling machinery (21Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 22Rothe M. Pan M.-G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) through physical interactions with members of the TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs). The TRAFs and c-IAPs are therefore thought to be signal transduction intermediates that are involved in JNK and NF-κB activation (23Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 24Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 25Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, XIAP does not interact with any of the known TRAF proteins or with any other components of the TNFR2 signaling pathway (16Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), suggesting that XIAP plays a role in the cell that is separate from those of c-IAP1 or c-IAP2. Several members of the IAP family have been reported to be involved in signaling cascades that are unrelated to the tumor necrosis factor pathway. For example, the Drosophila IAPs, dIAP-1 and dIAP-2/dILP, are known to interact with Thickveins (Tkv), a type I serine-threonine kinase receptor homologous to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor (27Oeda E. Oka Y. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9353-9356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). XIAP has been implicated in BMP signaling (28Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) as a bridging molecule between the BMP type I receptor and a downstream signaling molecule, TGF-β-activated kinase-binding protein 1 (TAB1). The TGF-β superfamily encodes a group of cytokines that includes BMP, TGF-β, and the activins/inhibins, and is involved in diverse cellular responses such as apoptosis, differentiation, and cell cycle arrest (29Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 30Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling initiated by this family of cytokines involves two classes of receptors. The type II receptors bind their specific ligand and then phosphorylate a type I receptor (31Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 32Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which propagates the signal through a specific subset of the Smad family of signal transduction intermediates and transcription factors (33Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 34Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). One of these intermediate signaling proteins, Smad4, is common to all of these signaling pathways in that it serves as the obligatory partner of the pathway-restricted Smad proteins and, together with them, translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression by binding to cognate sites in the promoters of target genes (35Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 36Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both TGF-β and XIAP have been reported to specifically activate JNK (19Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W.M. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 37Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Smad proteins have been shown to cooperate with the AP-1 transcription factor, a heterodimer of c-Fos and c-Jun that binds specific sequences in its target promoters (38Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). AP-1 activity is stimulated by phosphorylation of the c-Jun transactivation domain by JNK (38Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar, 39Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.-T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent data have shown a direct, TGF-β-inducible interaction between Smad3 and c-Jun (36Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Because both TGF-β and XIAP can activate JNK, and the TGF-β and JNK signaling pathways are closely linked, we examined the possibility of a role for XIAP in TGF-β-mediated signaling. Data presented here reveal the involvement of XIAP in signaling through the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI). XIAP was found to co-localize with TβRI and to interact with this receptor. XIAP also activated transcription of both TGF-β- and κB-responsive promoters. Furthermore, the signaling properties of XIAP were found to be distinct from its anti-apoptotic properties in that signaling by XIAP was inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Smad4, whereas its anti-apoptotic properties were unaffected by dominant negative Smad4. These data suggest that XIAP is involved in both caspase inhibition and signaling through the TβRI receptor. The pEBB expression vector has been described previously (40Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and the pEBB-Flag, pEBB-HA, and pEBB-T7 expression vectors are all derivatives of pEBB that have been modified to incorporate the appropriate epitope tag and translational termination codes in all three reading frames. The full-length, ΔRING, and 3xBIR XIAP vectors were generated by subcloning into pEBB or one of its epitope-tagged derivatives, as described previously (16Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The pEBG mammalian glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector (41Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Mayer. The GST-XIAP/hILP, GST-c-IAP1, and GST-c-IAP2 fusion proteins have been previously described (16Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Deletions of XIAP were subcloned into pEBG in-frame with the GST reading frame to generate pEBG-ΔRING and pEBG-3xBIR. The 2κB-luc reporter construct has been described previously (42Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3TP-Lux reporter was kindly provided by Dr. J. Massagué. The wild type and dominant negative Smad4 (ΔM4) constructs were gifts of Dr. M. de Caestecker. The HA-tagged expression vectors encoding wild type, constitutively active (T204D), and kinase-deficient (K232R) TβRI receptors, as well as the constitutively active ALK mutants, were gifts from Dr. J. Wrana and Dr. L. Attisano. The Bax expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. S. Korsmeyer. The HA-JNK expression vector was a gift from Dr. M. G. Sanna. The full-length open reading frame of TAK1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction utilizing the following two primers: 5′-ATAGGATCCATGTCTACAGCCTCTGCCGCCTCC-3′ and 5′-ATTATCGATATTTCAAAATGTAACGGTCCCAGAGAATC-3′ using standard conditions. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and subcloned into pEBB-T7. This clone was sequenced in its entirety and found to be identical to human TAK1a (43Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). The K63W dominant negative mutant (DN TAK1) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and was confirmed by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and HeLa (human adenocarcinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HepG2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Eagle's medium containing Earle's salts (EMEM) with 10% FBS. All media were supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, and all cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection of 293 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure as described previously (44Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Duckett C.S. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6820-6823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 10 µl of LipofectAMINE with 200 µl of serum-free DMEM for each well of a six-well plate, for 5 h. Following transfection, the medium was changed to EMEM with 10% FBS, and cells were incubated for 16 h. The medium was then changed to EMEM + 0.2% FBS with or without 5 ng/ml TGF-β and allowed to incubate for another 24 h. Transfection of HeLa cells was performed as described above, except that 6 µl of LipofectAMINE was incubated for 3 h, and following transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% FBS and incubated for 16 h prior to harvest. For 3TP-Lux reporter assays, cells were transfected with 200 ng/well reporter plasmid together with 2 µg/well indicated expression vector, in a six-well plate. For 2κB-luc reporter assays, 50 ng/well reporter was transfected along with 2 µg/well indicated expression vectors. Cells were transfected for 6–8 h, after which time the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM + 10% FBS and cells were incubated for 16 h. In all transfections, the amount of DNA was kept constant by the addition of an empty control vector. Cells were harvested by washing once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysing in 0.5 ml of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Luciferase activity was quantified using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) on a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer (PE Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). All assays were performed in triplicate, and all data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. 293 cells were transiently transfected with a total of 10 µg of plasmid DNA in a 10-cm dish. Following transfection, cells were washed once in 5 ml of PBS and lysed for 10 min at room temperature in 1.0 ml of 1% Triton X-100 buffer (45Duckett C.S. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2810-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Following lysis, 400 µl of lysate were incubated with 20 µl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Triton X-100 buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 4–12% gradient gel electrophoresis in 1× MOPS buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electrophoretic blotting transfer buffer (Invitrogen) containing 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween (TBS-T) and 5% milk. Proteins were visualized by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody in TBS-T with 5% milk for 1 h, followed by secondary incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) in TBS-T with 5% milk for 1 h. The blot was washed twice for 10 min and once for 30 min in TBS-T and resolved using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary antibodies used were anti-HA antibody (Mono HA.11; Covance, Berkeley, CA), anti-GST (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Myc (9E10; Covance, Berkeley, CA), anti-T7 tag (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated; Novagen, Madison, WI), anti-hILP (H59520; Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). HepG2 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well onto sterilized glass coverslips (Corning, Charlotte, NC), incubated for 16 h, and transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. Cells were washed once in PBS, fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed once in PBS, and blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with either of the following primary antibodies: anti-hILP/XIAP mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) or rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:200, sc-805, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were washed three times with PBS prior to incubation with the second primary antibody and then incubated for 30 min with the following secondary antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000, Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) in PBS with 10% goat serum. Cells were mounted with medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vectashield mounting medium H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and then visualized with a Zeiss confocal microscope. 293 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 µg of HA-tagged JNK and 2 µg of the indicated plasmid in a six-well plate. Following 18 h of incubation, cells were lysed in 0.3 ml of M2 buffer (19Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W.M. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) on ice for 30 min. For assays involving p38 inhibitors, cells were treated with 50 µm SB203580 or 30 µm SB202190 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and allowed to incubate for 24 h prior to lysis. Protein concentrations were standardized by the method of Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad) followed by immunoprecipitation of HA-JNK with protein A-Sepharose and a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C. In vitro kinase assays were performed exactly as described (23Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK was measured as phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun. Expression of HA-JNK, XIAP, Myc-DN Smad4, and T7-DN TAK1 was confirmed by immunoblotting. 293 cells were transiently transfected with 2 µg of the indicated expression vector along with 0.5 µg of a Bax expression vector in a six-well plate. Following 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 µl of caspase assay cell lysis buffer (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). These cells were lysed for 10 min at room temperature with gentle rocking, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Protein concentrations were standardized, and caspase assays were performed using the ApoTarget protease assay (BIOSOURCE) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Samples were read every 5 min for 2 h on a Cytofluor 4000 fluorescence plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 508 nm. To explore the possibility that XIAP might associate with members of the TGF-β receptor superfamily, constitutively active mutant members of the TGF-β type I receptor superfamily were cotransfected with a mammalian GST-XIAP expression vector into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Cell lysates were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and associated receptors were detected by immunoblot analysis. XIAP was found to coprecipitate with several members of the receptor superfamily, most notably TSR1 (ALK1), activin RIb (ALK4), and TGF-β RI (ALK5) receptors (Fig. 1 A). Weaker interactions were also observed between GST-XIAP and activin RI (ALK2) and BMP RIa (ALK3) receptors upon longer exposures (data not shown). The BMP RIb (ALK6) receptor did not coprecipitate with XIAP. To determine whether the activation state of TβRI affected its interaction with XIAP, constitutively active (ALK5*), wild type TβRI (ALK5), and kinase-deficient TβRI (ALK5 kinase-deficient) were compared for their ability to associate with XIAP in 293 cells. XIAP was found to interact equivalently with all versions of TβRI (Fig.1 B), indicating that the receptor need not be activated to interact with XIAP. Since there are currently no antibodies available to allow the detection of endogenous TβRI, immunofluorescence analysis was performed on HepG2 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding both XIAP and HA-tagged TβRI, in order to confirm the interaction between TβRI and XIAP. Transfected cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. XIAP and TβRI were observed to co-localize predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2), although interestingly a small proportion of XIAP was detected in the nucleus of transfected cells. These data provide further evidence for an interaction between these proteins. To further explore the possibility of nuclear localization or translocation of XIAP, immunofluorescence analysis was performed on several cell lines transfected with epitope-tagged XIAP and subsequently treated with either a media control, or media containing TGF-β. The subcellular localization of XIAP was observed by confocal microscopy, and no change in localization was seen upon treatment with TGF-β (data not shown). To determine whether other IAP family members, in addition to XIAP, could interact with TβRI, coprecipitations were performed with several members of the IAP family (XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2) and TβRI. TβRI was found to coprecipitate with GST-XIAP, but not with the other IAP family members or with the GST control vector (Fig.3 A). These data suggest that TβRI associates specifically with XIAP. XIAP contains three N-terminal BIR domains and a C-terminal RING finger, separated by an amphipathic spacer region (6Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C.

To determine which domains of XIAP are involved in binding the TβRI receptor, sequential deletions of the C-terminal domains of XIAP fused to the mammalian GST protein were utilized in coprecipitation experiments. A weak interaction was detected between TβRI and the XIAP ΔRING construct, while a strong interaction was observed between TβRI receptor and the 3xBIR domain of XIAP, which lacks both the RING finger and the spacer region (Fig.3 B). These data suggest that the XIAP-TβRI interaction involves the BIR domain of XIAP. Since an interaction between XIAP and TβRI was observed, the possibility was tested that XIAP might be involved in regulating transcripti"

We determined whether p38 MAPK is activated by IFN-α in BCR-ABL-expressing cells and whether its function is required for the generation of growth inhibitory responses. IFN-α treatment induced phosphorylation/activation of p38 in the IFN-α-sensitive KT-1 cell line, but not in IFN-α-resistant K562 cells. Consistent with this, IFN-α treatment of KT-1 (but not K562) cells induced activation of the small GTPase Rac1, which functions as an upstream regulator of p38.

To define the functional role of the Rac1/p38 MAPK pathway in IFN-α signaling, the effects of pharmacological inhibition of p38 on the induction of IFN-α responses were determined. Treatment of KT-1 cells with the p38-specific inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 reversed the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α.

CML is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of hematopoietic stem cells, and the hallmark of the disease is the expression of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein in the malignant cells. BCR-ABL is the product of the bcr-abl oncogene, which is generated by the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the fusion of bcr to c-abl and the formation of the abnormal bcr/abl proto-oncogene (9Groffen J.

Thus, signaling specificity via the IFN-α-activated JAK/STAT pathway appears to be determined by the formation of distinct complexes among STAT proteins that activate different regulatory elements in the promoters of target genes. Recent studies have established that, in addition to the STAT pathway, type I IFNs activate MAPKs, including ERK kinases (15David M. Petricoin E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C.

Such regulatory effects of p38 MAPK on IFN transcriptional activation are unrelated to tyrosine or serine phosphorylation of STAT proteins and apparently involve activation of downstream signaling pathways that function independently of the STAT pathway (19Uddin S. Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B. Mayer I. Young P.R. Bokoch G.M. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27634-27640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, coordination of the STAT and p38 MAPK pathways is required for transcriptional activation of IFN-α-sensitive genes. The mechanisms of action of IFN-α in CML are not understood. Very little is known of the signaling events induced by IFN-α in BCR-ABL-expressing cells, primarily due to a lack of IFN-sensitive, BCR-ABL-expressing cell line model systems. In this study, we used the recently established IFN-α-sensitive KT-1 cell line (20Yanagisawa K. Yamauchi H. Kaneko M. Kohno H. Hasegawa H. Fujita S. Blood. 1998; 91: 641-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine whether p38 and its upstream effector, Rac1, are engaged in IFN signaling in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. We also examined whether the p38 pathway is engaged in IFN-α signaling in primary cells obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with CML. Our data indicate that IFN-α activates the Rac1/p38 MAPK pathway in CML cells. Most importantly, pharmacological blockade of p38 reverses the inhibitory effects of IFN-α in KT-1 cells and primary leukemic bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors, providing the first direct evidence that the p38 MAPK pathway is essential for the generation of the growth inhibitory and anti-leukemic effects of IFN-α. The KT-1 and K562 cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Human recombinant IFN-α2 was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. Human recombinant consensus IFN-α was provided by Amgen Inc. Antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of p38 and ERK2 were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. and used for immunoblotting. A polyclonal antibody against p38 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against STAT1, Rac1, and ERK2 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). An antibody that specifically recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT1 at tyrosine 701 and an antibody that recognizes anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. and used for immunoblotting. The p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 and the MEK kinase inhibitor PD098059 were purchased from Calbiochem. Cells were stimulated with 1 × 104 IU/ml IFN-α for the indicated times and lysed as previously described (21Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X.-J. Sweet M.E. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

The cells were treated with IFN for the indicated times and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer. Cell lysates were incubated with 5 µg of GST-PBD, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody against Rac1 to detect GTP-bound Rac1. In vitro kinase assays to detect the activation of the MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3 kinases by IFN-α were performed as previously described (17Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y.

Cells were pretreated for 30–60 min with SB203580 (20 µm), SB202190 (10 µm), or PD098059 (20 µm) as indicated and subsequently incubated for 7 days with the indicated doses of IFN-α in the continuous presence of the pharmacological inhibitors. Cell proliferation assays using the MTT method were performed as described previously (24Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D. Gardziola C. Colamonici O.R. Kellum M. Pitha P.M. White M.F. Platanias L.C.

The antiviral effects of IFN-α in KT-1 cells were determined by assaying its activity against encephalomyocarditis virus infection as previously described (25Fish E.N. J. Interferon Res. 1992; 12: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Informed consent was obtained from patients with CML according to the guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were separated from peripheral venous blood using Mono-Poly Resolving Medium (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). After centrifugation at 300 × g for 30 min at room temperature, the plasma and mononuclear leukocyte band were discarded, and the polymorphonuclear leukocyte band was transferred to individual tubes. Cells were washed and resuspended in culture medium prior to stimulation with IFN-α. The effects of IFN-α on the growth of hematopoietic progenitors from patients with CML was determined in methylcellulose assays as described previously (26Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Bruno E. Korkmaz M.

Bone marrow aspirate specimens were obtained under local anesthesia from patients with CML after obtaining informed consent. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation, and cells were cultured in methylcellulose mixture containing hematopoietic growth factors (26Platanias L.C. Uddin S.

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units from leukemic bone marrow samples were scored on day 14 of culture. We sought to determine whether the p38 MAPK pathway is activated in response to IFN-α treatment in BCR-ABL-expressing cells of CML origin. We first performed studies with the CML-derived human leukemia cell line KT-1, which expresses BCR-ABL and is sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α (20Yanagisawa K. Yamauchi H. Kaneko M. Kohno H. Hasegawa H. Fujita S. Blood. 1998; 91: 641-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Grumbach I.M. Mayer I.A. Uddin S. Lekmine F. Majchrzak B. Yamauchi H. Fujita S. Druker B.J. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of IFN-α; and after cell lysis, total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of p38. IFN-α induced strong phosphorylation/activation of p38 MAPK in these cells (Fig.1, A and B). On the other hand, IFN-α treatment of the CML-derived K562 cell line, which is resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α (27Grumbach I.M. Mayer I.A. Uddin S. Lekmine F. Majchrzak B. Yamauchi H. Fujita S. Druker B.J. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), failed to induce phosphorylation/activation of p38 (Fig. 1 C). It should be pointed out that the inability to detect signals in anti-phospho-p38 immunoblots using lysates from K562 cells was not due to lack of p38 expression, as the p38 protein was abundantly expressed in these cells (Fig. 1 D). Thus, p38 is phosphorylated/activated in an IFN-α-dependent manner in KT-1 (but not K562) cells, indicating that the upstream components of this pathway are functional in the KT-1 cell line, but defective in K562 cells. Interestingly, the ERK2 kinase, another member of the MAPK family that has also previously been shown to be activated in response to IFN-α in non-BCR-ABL-expressing cells (15David M. Petricoin E.

TYK2 was also phosphorylated/activated in K562 cells (Fig. 3 B), indicating that defective activation of p38 in these cells does not result from lack of TYK2 activation. In studies to determine whether STAT proteins are activated in KT-1 and K562 cells, we found that the IFN-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 and STAT1 was clearly detectable in both KT-1 and K562 cells (Fig.4). This indicates that the lack of activation of p38 in K562 cells is not due to a common early upstream defect at the receptor level that also results in defective STAT2 and STAT1 activation. Furthermore, in studies to determine the effects of p38 inhibition on the IFN-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, we found that inhibition of p38 activation using the inhibitor SB203580 or SB202190 did not affect STAT1 phosphorylation on Tyr701 (Fig.5). Thus, as in the case of non-BCR-ABL-expressing cells (17Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

KT-1 or K562 cells were treated with IFN-α for the indicated times; and after cell lysis, lysates were bound to a GST fusion protein encoding the GTPase-binding domain of PAK1 (23Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) to detect GTP-bound Rac1. IFN-α treatment induced strong activation of Rac1 in KT-1 cells (Fig.6A). In K562 cells, some base-line activation of Rac1 was detectable, but there was no further increase in the amount of GTP-bound Rac1 in lysates from IFN-α-treated cells (Fig. 6 B), indicating that IFN-α-inducible activation of Rac1 is defective in these cells. We also performed studies to determine whether the activation of Rac1 in KT-1 cells is tyrosine kinase-dependent. The IFN-α-inducible activation of Rac1 was blocked by pretreatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, but not the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Fig.6 C). Thus, engagement of Rac1 in IFN-α signaling in BCR-ABL-expressing cells requires upstream activation of a tyrosine kinase(s), but not the function of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, which is also activated by the type I IFN receptor (16Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our data established that the Rac1/p38 MAPK pathway is activated independently of the STAT pathway in the IFN-α-sensitive, BCR-ABL-expressing KT-1 cell line. To obtain information on the functional relevance of p38 activation in the induction of IFN-α responses in CML cells, we performed experiments in which the effects of pharmacological inhibition of p38 on the generation of the antiproliferative and antiviral activities of IFN-α were examined. KT-1 cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or SB202190 and subsequently treated with IFN-α in the continuous presence or absence of the p38 MAPK pharmacological inhibitors. Cell proliferation was subsequently assessed using an MTT assay. As expected (20Yanagisawa K. Yamauchi H. Kaneko M. Kohno H. Hasegawa H. Fujita S. Blood. 1998; 91: 641-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Grumbach I.M. Mayer I.A. Uddin S. Lekmine F. Majchrzak B. Yamauchi H. Fujita S. Druker B.J. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), treatment of KT-1 cells with IFN-α suppressed the growth of KT-1 cells (Fig.7, A and B). However, concomitant treatment of cells with SB203580 (Fig.7 A) or SB202190 (Fig. 7 B) reversed the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α. On the other hand, treatment of cells with PD098059, which selectively inhibits activation of ERK kinases (but not p38), did not abrogate the IFN-α-inducible growth inhibition (Fig. 7 C). On the contrary, it slightly enhanced the generation of an IFN-α antiproliferative response in these cells. In other studies, we determined whether KT-1 cells are sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN-α and whether p38 plays a role in the induction of an antiviral state by IFN-α. As shown in Fig.8, KT-1 cells were susceptible to the cytopathic effects of encephalomyocarditis virus infection, whereas treatment with IFN-α inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with SB203580 partially inhibited the induction of IFN-α-regulated antiviral responses, suggesting a role for p38 in the IFN-α induction of antiviral effects. We subsequently sought to identify putative downstream effectors of p38 that may mediate the induction of IFN-α-dependent growth inhibitory responses in KT-1 cells. We determined whether the MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3 kinases, which are activated downstream of p38 in other systems (31Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 32Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), are engaged in IFN-α signaling in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. KT-1 cells were treated with IFN-α in the presence or absence of the inhibitor SB203580. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against MAPKAPK-2 or MAPKAPK-3. Subsequently, in vitro kinase assays were carried out on the immunoprecipitates using HSP25 as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig. 9, treatment of KT-1 cells with IFN-α resulted in strong activation of MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3. Such activation was blocked by pretreatment of cells with SB203580, indicating that activation of the kinase domains of MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3 is p38-dependent. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of p38 reverses the biological effects of IFN-α in the KT-1 cell line, and such reversal correlates with inhibition of MAPKAPK-2/3 kinases (but not STAT) activation (Fig. 5), raising the possibility that MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3 are downstream targets of p38 that mediate IFN-α-dependent growth inhibition in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Based on the data from the studies with the KT-1 cell line, the p38/MAPKAPK-2/3 pathway appeared to play an important role in the generation of the antiproliferative effects of IFN-α in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. This prompted us to extend these studies to determine the biological relevance of this pathway in the generation of the anti-leukemic effects of IFN-α in primary cells from patients with CML. We first determined whether p38 is phosphorylated/activated in an IFN-α-dependent manner in isolated granulocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of four different patients with CML. The granulocytes were treated with IFN-α; and after cell lysis, total lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of p38. Treatment of cells with IFN-α induced phosphorylation/activation of p38 MAPK (Fig.10, A, C,E, and G), whereas there was no change in the levels of p38 protein expression (B, D,F, and H). We subsequently determined whether the p38 MAPK pathway plays a role in inducing the antiproliferative effects of IFN-α on primary leukemic hematopoietic progenitors. We determined whether two specific inhibitors of p38 (SB203580 and SB202190) reversed the generation of the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α on leukemic progenitors in clonogenic assays in methylcellulose. Bone marrow samples from four CML patients were obtained and studied. IFN-α inhibited colony formation of myeloid progenitors isolated from the bone marrow samples of all patients with CML (Fig. 11,A–D). Concomitant treatment of cells with SB203580 reversed the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α on the leukemic progenitors (Fig. 11, A–D). In a similar manner, SB202190 also reversed the inhibitory effects of IFN-α on leukemic progenitor colony formation, whereas treatment with PD098059 had no effects (Fig.11, A and B). Thus, pharmacological inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway abrogates the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α on clonogenic hematopoietic progenitor growth in the bone marrow samples of CML patients, indicating that the function of p38 is essential for the generation of the anti-leukemic effects of IFN-α. Despite the well documented clinical effects of IFN-α in CML, very little is known regarding the mechanisms of IFN signaling in cells expressing BCR-ABL. In this study, we provide the first evidence that IFN-α activates the p38 MAPK pathway in CML-derived IFN-sensitive cells. Most importantly, our data provide direct evidence that this signaling cascade plays a critical role in the induction of the anti-leukemic activities of IFN-α in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. This is revealed by the finding that pharmacological inhibition of p38 reverses the biological effects of IFN-α in an IFN-α-sensitive CML line and primary leukemic bone marrow-derived myeloid progenitors. The SB203580 and SB202190 inhibitors of the p38 MAPK pathway used in our studies have been previously shown to exhibit specificity for p38 MAPK. They act by binding to the ATP site and by inhibiting the kinase activity of p38 MAPK, and the basis for their selectivity has been determined by mutagenesis and x-ray crystallographic structures of p38-inhibitor complexes (33Tong L.

Both SB203580 and SB202190 have similar target specificities; and in addition to inhibiting p38 (also called p38α), they inhibit the p38β2 isoform (but not the p38γ and p38δ isoforms) of the same family (36Kumar S.

Thus, our data demonstrating reversal of the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α by treatment with these pyridinyl imidazole compounds provide strong evidence for an important role of p38 (p38α) and possibly p38β2 in the induction of the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α in CML. Our data clearly establish that the small GTPase Rac1, which functions as an upstream effector of p38 in various systems, including the IFN system (19Uddin S. Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 844-853PubMed Google Scholar), is rapidly activated during IFN-α treatment of the IFN-sensitive KT-1 CML cell line, but not the IFN-resistant K562 cell line. This activation of Rac1 in KT-1 cells is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, but not the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Thus, the function of a tyrosine kinase(s) is required for Rac1 activation in KT-1 cells, but such activation does not require upstream engagement of the IFN-α-dependent insulin receptor substrate/phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase pathway (16Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar, 21Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X.-J. Sweet M.E. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

It is therefore likely that activation of the TYK2 and/or JAK1 kinase, both of which are associated with the type I IFN receptor, regulates downstream activation of Rac1 and p38. Such a regulation should involve an intermediate protein substrate that links JAK kinase activation to Rac1, and the identity of such a Rac1 regulator remains to be established. In previous studies, we have established that the function of p38 is required for transcriptional regulation of IFN-sensitive genes that express IFN-stimulated response elements or IFN-γ-activated sites in their promoters (17Uddin S.

Nenturini L. Lee C. Saib A. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Guillemin M.-C. Schindler C. de Thé H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2565-2573PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the requirement for p38 MAPK in the induction of the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-α is mediated by up-regulation of expression of this gene and possibly other related genes with tumor suppressor activity. However, activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by IFN-α may have additional effects that mediate growth inhibitory responses such as regulation of signals that modify cell cycle progression in CML cells. Our data indicate that the MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3 kinases are downstream effectors for p38, activated by IFN-α in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. It is therefore possible that MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3 play important roles in the induction of the anti-leukemic effects of IFN-α in CML cells either via regulation of gene transcription or via engagement of other downstream effectors that regulate cell cycle progression. Regardless of the precise mechanisms involved, p38 appears to play a critical role in the generation of the antiproliferative effects of IFN-α on leukemic progenitors as well as on normal bone marrow erythroid and myeloid progenitors. 2A. Verma and L. C. Platanias, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the p38 MAPK pathway may participate in the generation of both the anti-leukemic effects of IFN-α as well as the documented hematologic toxicity that this cytokine exhibits when administered to humans (7Gutterman J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar,8Wetzler M. Kantarjian H. Talpaz M. Am. J. Med. 1995; 99: 402-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the p38 pathway acts in cooperation with other IFN-activated pathways such as the STAT pathway to regulate induction of growth inhibition by IFN-α in CML cells. Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that IFN-α treatment induces formation of STAT5-CrkL complexes in KT-1 cells and that such complexes bind to one of the IFN-γ-activated sites of the promyelocyte leukemia gene promoter (27Grumbach I.M. Mayer I.A. Uddin S. Lekmine F. Majchrzak B. Yamauchi H. Fujita S. Druker B.J. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The promoter of the PML gene also contains IFN-stimulated response elements regulated by the IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 complex, which involves STAT2-STAT1 complexes. The fact that the p38 MAPK pathway is required for transcriptional regulation of the promoter of this gene (19Uddin S. Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B. Mayer I. Young P.R. Bokoch G.M. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27634-27640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which is also regulated by different STAT-binding complexes, suggests a coordination of signaling functions between the p38 MAPK and STAT pathways. Such a coordination may be important in the induction of the direct anti-leukemic effects of IFN-α in CML cells. It has been previously shown that IFN-α down-regulates expression of the bcr-abl oncogene, which causes the malignant transformation (42Pane F. Mostarda I. Selleri C. Salzano R. Raiola A.M. Luciano L. Saglio G. Rotoli B. Salvatore F. Blood. 1999; 94: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest the existence of a direct mechanism, distinct from inhibition of BCR-ABL expression, that mediates the antiproliferative effects of IFN-α. It is possible that the p38 MAPK pathway also contributes to the induction of the anti-leukemic effects of other pharmacological agents such as STI571 that exhibit selective growth inhibitory effects in CML cells (40Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). A potential scenario may be that BCR-ABL exhibits constitutive negative regulatory effects on the activation of the growth inhibitory p38 MAPK pathway. Activation of the IFN-α-dependent tyrosine kinases or inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by STI571 may overcome such negative regulatory effects of BCR-ABL on p38 MAPK and result in inhibition of malignant cell growth. Future studies in that direction are warranted and may provide further insights into the mechanisms of BCR-ABL-mediated leukemogenesis as well as clarification of the mechanisms by which drugs and cytokines block BCR-ABL-mediated cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W2008297774,"Accumulating evidence indicates that the β-arrestins act as scaffold molecules that couple G-protein-coupled receptors to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways. Recently, we identified the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) as a β-arrestin2-interacting protein in yeast-two hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies. β-Arrestin2 acts as a scaffold to enhance signaling to JNK3 stimulated by overexpression of the MAP3 kinase ASK1 or by agonist activation of the angiotensin 1A receptor. Whereas β-arrestin2 is a very strong activator of JNK3 signaling, β-arrestin1 is very weak in this regard. The data also indicate that the specific step enhanced by β-arrestin2 involves phosphorylation of JNK3 by the MAP2 kinase MKK4. We reasoned that defining the region (or domain) in β-arrestin2 responsible for high level JNK3 activation would provide insight into the mechanism by which β-arrestin2 enhances the activity of this signaling pathway. Using chimeric β-arrestins, we have determined that sequences in the carboxyl-terminal region of β-arrestin2 are important for the enhancement of JNK3 phosphorylation. More detailed analysis of the carboxyl-terminal domains of the β-arrestins indicated that β-arrestin2, but not β-arrestin1, contains a sequence (RRSLHL) highly homologous to the conserved docking motif present in many MAP kinase-binding proteins. Replacement of the β-arrestin2 RRS residues with the corresponding KP residues present in β-arrestin1 dramatically reduced both JNK3 interaction and enhancement of JNK3 phosphorylation. Conversely, replacement of the KP residues in β-arrestin1 with RRS significantly increased both JNK3 binding and enhancement of JNK3 phosphorylation. These results delineate a mechanism by which β-arrestin2 functions as a scaffold protein in the JNK3 signaling pathway and implicate the conserved docking site in β-arrestin2 as an important factor in binding JNK3 and stimulating the phosphorylation of JNK3 by MKK4.

Replacement of the β-arrestin2 RRS residues with the corresponding KP residues present in β-arrestin1 dramatically reduced both JNK3 interaction and enhancement of JNK3 phosphorylation. Conversely, replacement of the KP residues in β-arrestin1 with RRS significantly increased both JNK3 binding and enhancement of JNK3 phosphorylation. These results delineate a mechanism by which β-arrestin2 functions as a scaffold protein in the JNK3 signaling pathway and implicate the conserved docking site in β-arrestin2 as an important factor in binding JNK3 and stimulating the phosphorylation of JNK3 by MKK4.

However, recent studies indicate that the arrestins also function as adapter molecules important not only in signal termination but also in the activation of additional signaling pathways emanating from GPCRs (10Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Initial evidence implicating the β-arrestins as adapter molecules indicated that the β-arrestins directly interact with the heavy chain of clathrin, the clathrin adapter protein (AP-2), and theN-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF) to promote endocytosis of activated GPCRs (11McDonald P.H.

The β-arrestins form complexes with Raf (MAP3K), MEK (MAP2K), and ERK (MAPK) to facilitate the activity of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (17DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D. O'Bryan E.M. Nishijima D. Dery O.

Agonist stimulation of angiotensin 1A receptor (AT1aR) or protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) results in the recruitment of β-arrestin and activated ERK to the receptor (18DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J.

It is unclear if the activated ERK then translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription or if it remains associated with internalized receptors and phosphorylates unknown cytoplasmic targets. β-Arrestin2 also functions as a scaffold to enhance signal transmission to the MAP kinase JNK3 (20McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc Symp. 1999; 64 (Review): 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). β-Arrestin2 interacts with ASK1 (MAP3K), MKK4 (MAP2K), and JNK3 (MAPK) to markedly enhance JNK3 phosphorylation. Overexpression of ASK1 or stimulation of the AT1aR leads to a marked increase in JNK3 phosphorylation that requires β-arrestin2 (20McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy experiments indicate that a complex containing β-arrestin2 and JNK3 is sequestered in the cytoplasm and associates with the activated AT1aR following agonist stimulation. Similar to the situation with ERK, it remains undetermined if activated JNK3 at some point translocates to the nucleus or if it remains associated with β-arrestin2 and internalized receptors where it phosphorylates unknown cytoplasmic targets. These results indicate that formation of multiprotein complexes mediated by the β-arrestins stimulates signal transmission resulting in phosphorylation of MAPKs such as the ERKs and JNKs. It appears that β-arrestin2 functions as a scaffold protein analogous to the mammalian JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs) and the yeast protein Ste5 (22Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol.

Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The scaffold proteins share a common feature in that they all enhance signal transmission resulting in activation of MAP kinases. These scaffold proteins share little or no sequence homology, although they appear to serve very similar roles in the stimulation of MAP kinase cascades (25Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 26Levchenko A. Bruck J. Sternberg P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5818-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). It is clear that scaffold proteins, such as β-arrestin2, interact with multiple members of the MAP kinase cascades; however, very little is known about the specific molecular details by which these proteins enhance signaling. More specifically, it is not known if these scaffold proteins facilitate signal transmission at multiple steps in the pathway (as may be the case with Ste5) or if one particular step in the pathway is specifically enhanced. It is intriguing that although the β-arrestins share very high sequence homology (∼80%), they differ greatly with respect to their ability to enhance JNK3 phosphorylation (20McDonald P.H. Chow C.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Arrestin1 is a weak stimulator of ASK1-driven JNK3 phosphorylation in comparison with β-arrestin2 (20McDonald P.H.

Thus, the high degree of sequence similarity between β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 offers a unique opportunity to provide insights into the specific structural features of β-arrestin2 that permit it to act as a scaffold in the JNK3 pathway. Moreover, it is interesting that two molecules with very similar abilities to promote desensitization and receptor internalization, would have such markedly different abilities to act as scaffolds in the JNK3 signaling pathway. In the present study, we have analyzed the mechanism by which β-arrestin2 enhances JNK3 stimulation driven by upstream kinases in the JNK3 pathway such as ASK1 and MKK4. We provide evidence that sequences in the carboxyl-terminal domain of β-arrestin2 direct the assembly of a complex that facilitates the phosphorylation of JNK3 by MKK4. COS-7 African Green Monkey cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penn/strep (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were routinely subcultured 1:10 three times weekly. COS-7 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with 5 µg of total plasmid DNA and 20 µl of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were routinely harvested 48 h post-transfection. Expression vectors for β-arrestin1(FLAG), β-arrestin2(FLAG), arrestin1(FLAG), JNK3(HA), MKK4(HA), and β2-adrenergic receptor(FLAG) have been described previously (15Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S.

Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged β-arrestin chimeras were cloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). Briefly, for the β-arrestin1/2 chimera, DNA encoding a minimal KOZAK sequence and amino acids 1–184 of β-arrestin1 and DNA encoding amino acids 186–410 of β-arrestin2 with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag were PCR amplified and cloned by three way ligation into theEcoRV sites of pcDNA3. For the β-arrestin2/1 chimera, DNA encoding a minimal KOZAK sequence and amino acids 1–185 of β-arrestin2 and DNA encoding amino acids 185–418 of β-arrestin1 with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag were PCR amplified and cloned by three way ligation into the EcoRV sites of pcDNA3. Expression vectors for the β-arrestin1(RRS) and β-arrestin2(KP) mutants were constructed in a similar manner. For the β-arrestin1(RRS) mutant, DNA encoding a minimal KOZAK sequence and amino acids 1–184 of β-arrestin1 and DNA encoding amino acids 185–418 of β-arrestin1 (containing RRS in place of KP at residues 195–196) with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag were PCR amplified and cloned by three way ligation into the EcoRV sites of pcDNA3. For the β-arrestin2 (KP) mutant, DNA encoding a minimal KOZAK sequence and amino acids 1–185 of β-arrestin2 and DNA encoding amino acids 186–410 of β-arrestin2 (containing KP in place of RRS at residues 196–198) with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag were PCR amplified and cloned by three way ligation into the EcoRV sites of pcDNA3. All sequences were confirmed using an automated ABI DNA sequencer (Howard Hughes Nucleic Acid Facility, Duke University). Whole cell extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection by lysing cells in 1 ml of lysis buffer (LB) (20 mm HEPES, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 µg/ml aprotinin, 25 µg/ml leupeptin, 100 µm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and was stored at −80 °C until use. Approximately 25 µg of clarified supernatant was diluted in 2× sample buffer and saved as whole cell extract. HA-tagged proteins were immunopurified from the remaining supernatant with 20 µl of anti-HA (HA.11) affinity matrix (Covance) for >3 h with constant rocking at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed 3–4 times in lysis buffer and diluted in 50 µl of 2× sample buffer. Immunocomplexes (20 µl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblot as described below. Bound HA and associated proteins were detected by immunoblot as described below. Whole cell extracts or immunocomplexes were boiled for 10 min, separated on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex), and transferred to supported nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell) using a Millipore semi-dry electrophoretic transfer apparatus. Filters were stained with Ponceau S stain to visualize equal loading of protein in all lanes. Nonspecific reactivity was blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dried milk (BLOTTO). Rabbit antiserum directed against FLAG, HA, and JNK3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used at a 1:1000 dilution according to the manufacturer's specifications. Rabbit antiserum directed against phospho-JNK (Promega) or phospho-MKK4 (New England Biolabs) were used at a 1:2000 dilution according to the manufacturer's specifications. Mouse monoclonal antibody directed against MKK4 (Transduction Laboratories) was used at a 1:2000 dilution according to the manufacturer's specifications. Appropriate secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used at a dilution of 1:2000 in BLOTTO to detect bound primary antibody. Reactive proteins were detected by incubation of washed filters (TBST) in the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by exposure to autoradiographic film. Immunoblots were also quantified using a Fluor-STM MultiImager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Agonist-induced receptor internalization was assayed essentially as described (28Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h following transfection, cells containing FLAG-tagged β2-adrenergic receptors were subjected to stimulation with 10 µm isoproterenol (iso) for 30 min at 37 °C. Stimulated cells were then incubated for 1 h with anti-FLAG primary antibody on ice, incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody on ice and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% formaldehyde. Presence of cell-surface receptors was determined by flow cytometry (Duke University Flow Cytometry Facility). We have previously shown that β-arrestin2 interacts with the MAP kinase JNK3 and the MAP3 kinase ASK1 to strongly enhance JNK3 phosphorylation (pThr-Pro-pTyr) stimulated by ASK1 (20McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of increasing amounts of ASK1 alone results in an increase of JNK3 phosphorylation up to ∼3-fold (Fig. 1A). In the presence of β-arrestin1, ASK1-stimulated phosphorylation of JNK3 is enhanced moderately up to ∼8-fold. However, in the presence of β-arrestin2, phosphorylation of JNK3 is strongly enhanced up to ∼35-fold. Whole cell extracts were analyzed for ASK1, JNK3, and β-arrestin levels to ensure equivalent expression of the transfected proteins (Fig.1 A, lower panels and data not shown). To gain additional insight into the mechanism by which β-arrestin2 enhances signaling to the MAP kinase JNK3, we analyzed the effect of the β-arrestins on ASK1-stimulated phosphorylation of the MAP2 kinase MKK4. Transfection of increasing amounts of ASK1 results in robust phosphorylation of MKK4 that is unaffected by either β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). Whole cell extracts were analyzed for ASK1, MKK4, and β-arrestin protein levels to ensure equal expression of the transfected proteins (Fig.1 B, lower panels and data not shown). Therefore, under our experimental conditions, overexpression of ASK1 alone is sufficient to promote signals leading to phosphorylation of MKK4. However, β-arrestin2 is required to promote signaling leading to phosphorylation of JNK3. Fig. 1 suggests that a major function of β-arrestin2 as a scaffold protein in the JNK3 signaling cascade is to enhance signaling from MKK4 to JNK3. We therefore analyzed whether the β-arrestins could support strong JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by MKK4 (Fig.2, upper panel). Similar to the effect of the β-arrestins on JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by ASK1, β-arrestin2 strongly enhances JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by increasing amounts of MKK4 (0.03–0.100 µg of plasmid DNA). Although β-arrestin1 weakly enhances JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by ASK1, there is no effect of β-arrestin1 on enhancement of JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by MKK4. Whole cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblot for MKK4 levels to ensure equivalent levels of the stimulatory upstream kinase (Fig. 2, lower panel). Recent data indicates that stimulation of JNK3 phosphorylation by anisomycin requires activation of MKK4, as cells deficient in MKK4 do not respond to acute stimulation with anisomycin (29Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Transfection of β-arrestin2, but not β-arrestin1, also specifically enhances JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by acute treatment with anisomycin (data not shown). These results indicate that at least one function of β-arrestin2 is to specifically enhance signaling from MKK4 to JNK3. Because β-arrestin2 is a very strong stimulator of JNK3 phosphorylation in comparison with β-arrestin1, we hypothesized that the generation of chimeric molecules of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 would be useful to further understand the effect of β-arrestin2 on stimulation of JNK3 phosphorylation. The crystal structure of the closely related visual arrestin protein indicates that the β-arrestins would be predicted to be bipartite molecules with two distinct domains separated by a small linker comprised of amino acids 181–187. The β-arrestin1/2 chimera consists of amino acids 1–184 of β-arrestin1 and amino acids 186–410 of β-arrestin2. The β-arrestin2/1 chimera consists of amino acids 1–185 of β-arrestin2 and amino acids 185–418 of β-arrestin1. The basic structures of the chimeras are shown in Fig. 3A,and the β-arrestin2 sequences are depicted in black, while β-arrestin1 sequences are depicted in white. FLAG-tagged expression plasmids for the β-arrestin chimeras, wild-type β-arrestin1, and wild-type β-arrestin2 were transfected into COS-7 cells with HA-tagged JNK3. The JNK3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and bound β-arrestins were analyzed by immunoblot using FLAG antibody (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). The weak signal in the control lane represents nonspecific binding of β-arrestin2 to the antibody used in the immunoprecipitations. In agreement with our earlier findings, β-arrestin2 interacts strongly with JNK3, although β-arrestin1 exhibits weak binding to JNK3. The β-arrestin1/2 chimera, but not the β-arrestin2/1 chimera interacted strongly with JNK3 indicating that the carboxyl terminus of β-arrestin2 contains the major determinants for JNK3 interaction. Analysis of the β-arrestin expression in whole cell extracts confirmed that the wild-type and chimeric proteins were expressed equivalently (Fig.3 B, lower panel). Overexpression of ASK1 results in a low level of JNK3 phosphorylation that is strongly enhanced by β-arrestin2 but not by β-arrestin1 (Fig. 1 A, top panel). Because the β-arrestin1/2 chimera retains strong JNK3 binding equivalent to β-arrestin2, we hypothesized that the β-arrestin1/2 chimera would enhance JNK3 phosphorylation similarly to wild-type β-arrestin2. COS-7 cells expressing β-arrestin1, β-arrestin1/2, β-arrestin2/1, or β-arrestin2 along with JNK3 and increasing amounts of ASK1 (0.1–1.0 µg of plasmid DNA) were analyzed for phospho-JNK3 (Fig.4A, top panel). As expected β-arrestin1 exhibited weak enhancement of JNK3 phosphorylation, although β-arrestin2 strongly enhanced JNK3 phosphorylation. The β-arrestin1/2 chimera that binds strongly to JNK3 also is a strong inducer of JNK3 phosphorylation, similar to the levels induced by β-arrestin2. In contrast, the β-arrestin2/1 chimera is a weak inducer of JNK3 phosphorylation similar to β-arrestin1. Whole cell extracts were analyzed for ASK1 expression to ensure equal expression of the stimulatory upstream kinase (Fig.4 A, lower panel). The effect of the β-arrestins on JNK3 phosphorylation is shown in graphic form as analyzed by quantitation of phospho-JNK3 on immunoblots (Fig. 4 B). To more precisely map the region required for enhanced JNK3 phosphorylation, additional chimeras were constructed that switch amino acid residues carboxyl-terminal to amino acids 333/335 of the β-arrestins. A chimera that contains the first 335 amino acids of β-arrestin2 and the last 85 amino acids of β-arrestin1 strongly enhances ASK1-stimulated JNK3 phosphorylation although the reverse chimera weakly enhances JNK3 phosphorylation (data not shown). These data indicate that amino acids 186–335 of β-arrestin2 contain the determinants for strong enhancement of JNK3 phosphorylation. β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 differ significantly in their ability to stimulate JNK3 phosphorylation. However, β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 are 81% identical in the region that contains determinants for low or high level induction of JNK3 phosphorylation (amino acids 186–335) (Fig.5A). One striking difference is amino acids 196–198 of β-arrestin2 (195–196 of β-arrestin1). Interestingly, these amino acids are also very similar to the conserved docking motif present in many MAP kinase-binding proteins. This region encodes Lys-Pro (KP) in β-arrestin1 and Arg-Arg-Ser (RRS) in β-arrestin2. We hypothesized that these amino acids could be responsible for the dramatic difference in the function of these two proteins. To test this hypothesis we constructed mutants of each protein that contain the corresponding residues from the other β-arrestin isoform. β-Arrestin2(KP) is therefore a full-length β-arrestin2 molecule with the RRS residues replaced with KP. β-Arrestin1(RRS) is a full-length β-arrestin1 molecule with the KP residues replaced with RRS. To test the effect of mutation of these amino acids on JNK3 interaction, we transfected HA-JNK3 along with FLAG-tagged β-arrestin1, β-arrestin(RRS), β-arrestin2(KP), or β-arrestin2 into COS-7 cells. JNK3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, associated β-arrestin proteins were detected by immunoblot, and the relative strengths of interaction were determined by quantitation of band intensities in comparison with β-arrestin2 (Fig. 5 B,upper panel). The weak signal in the control lane represents nonspecific binding of β-arrestin 2 to the antibody used in the immunoprecipitations. As expected, β-arrestin2 interacted strongly with JNK3. However, introduction of the KP residues into β-arrestin2 significantly decreased the strength of the interaction to ∼20% of the binding observed with wild-type β-arrestin2. Similar to our earlier findings, the relative strength of β-arrestin1 interaction with JNK3 is ∼10% of the binding observed with wild-type β-arrestin2.

https://openalex.org/W2018332755,"All known naturally occurring linear cationic peptides adopt an amphipathic α-helical conformation upon binding to lipids as an initial step in the induction of cell leakage. We designed an 18-residue peptide, (KIGAKI)3-NH2, that has no amphipathic character as an α-helix but can form a highly amphipathic β-sheet. When bound to lipids, (KIGAKI)3-NH2 did indeed form a β-sheet structure as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activity of this peptide was compared with that of (KIAGKIA)3-NH2, and it was better than that of GMASKAGAIAGKIAKVALKAL-NH2(PGLa) and (KLAGLAK)3-NH2, all of which form amphipathic α-helices when bound to membranes. (KIGAKI)3-NH2 was much less effective at inducing leakage in lipid vesicles composed of mixtures of the acidic lipid, phosphatidylglycerol, and the neutral lipid, phosphatidylcholine, as compared with the other peptides. However, when phosphatidylethanolamine replaced phosphatidylcholine, the lytic potency of PGLa and the α-helical model peptides was reduced, whereas that of (KIGAKI)3-NH2 was improved. Fluorescence experiments using analogs containing a single tryptophan residue showed significant differences between (KIGAKI)3-NH2 and the α-helical peptides in their interactions with lipid vesicles. Because the data suggest enhanced selectivity between bacterial and mammalian lipids, linear amphipathic β-sheet peptides such as (KIGAKI)3-NH2 warrant further investigation as potential antimicrobial agents."

Improper regulation of apoptosis has been connected with various diseases including cancer, autoimmune disorders, viral infections, AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders, and myocardial infarction (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar). Because of its extraordinary importance in human diseases, the therapeutic regulation of apoptosis offers numerous challenges (2Nicholson D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The basis for therapeutic intervention, however, is the identification of the molecular players involved in apoptosis regulation. During the last few years, numerous factors constituting the machinery that initiates and regulates apoptosis have already been characterized. Specialized receptors, so-called death receptors, of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily induce apoptosis by ligand binding and receptor oligomerization, followed by the recruitment of adapter and effector proteins to the death domain of the receptor (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized death receptor is the so-called CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) receptor that plays a major role in controlling immune cells. CD95(Fas/Apo-1) is involved in the deletion of autoreactive cells and activation-induced T cell death, killing of virus-infected cells or cancer cells, and killing of inflammatory cells at immune privileged sites (4Griffith T.S.

The net effect of substrate processing is the ordered destruction of the cell body including fragmentation of DNA and formation of fragmented cell particles, apoptotic bodies, which are engulfed by neighboring cells (15Ren Y. Savill J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular details of the destruction process, the identification of caspase substrates involved in the elementary processes of apoptosis is essential. Proteome approaches have been successfully used to find new apoptosis-associated proteins (16Brockstedt E. Rickers A. Kostka S. Laubersheimer A. Dorken B. Wittmann-Liebold B. Bommert K. Otto A. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We recently established an Internet-accessible two-dimensional gel electrophoresis data base (available on the World Wide Web) of the Jurkat T cells (32Thiede B. Siejak F. Dimmler C. Jungblut P. Rudel T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In order to identify proteins that are modified during apoptosis, we used the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis data base as a reference to investigate the proteome of Jurkat T cells that had been induced to undergo apoptosis. 37 apoptosis-modified spots of 21 different proteins were identified. Interestingly, 15 of these proteins contain an RNA-binding motif (33Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and 12 are involved in the splicing process. The Jurkat T cell line E6 was maintained in RPMI tissue culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 µg/ml) (Life Technologies) at 37 °C in 5.0% CO2. Apoptosis was induced in 2 × 106 Jurkat T cells for 6 h at 37 °C in 5.0% CO2 by 250 ng/ml αCD95 (clone CH11) (Immunotech, Marseille, France). 1 µg/ml cycloheximide was added to the control- and the Fas-induced cells. Approximately 1 × 108 Jurkat T cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 1300 units/min at room temperature in a Megafuge 1.0R (Heraeus Instruments GmbH, Hanau, Germany). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies) and once with MB buffer (400 mmsucrose, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm potassium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.6, and 0.2% BSA) and centrifuged as above. The pellet was suspended in MB buffer (4 ml/108 cells) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Subsequently, the cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 3500 units/min for 1 min at 4 °C (Rotor SS-34; Sorvall RC5B, Hanau, Germany). The supernatant contained the mitochondria/cytosol/membranes, and the pellet enclosed the nucleus. The mitochondrial fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 8600 units/min for 10 min at 4 °C (Rotor SS-34; Sorvall RC5B). The supernatant contained the cytosol and membranes. The pellet was suspended in MSM buffer (10 mmpotassium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.3 mm mannitol, and 0.1% BSA) (0.4 ml/108 cells) and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation in 10 ml of SA buffer (1.6 msucrose, 10 mm potassium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.1% BSA) and 10 ml of SB buffer (1.2 m sucrose, 10 mm potassium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.1% BSA) at 20,000 units/min for 1 h at 4 °C (Rotor SW-28; Beckman L8–70M Ultracentrifuge, München, Germany). The interphase that contained the mitochondria was collected, suspended in 4 volumes of MSM buffer, and centrifuged again at 15,500 units/min for 10 min at 4 °C (Rotor SS-34; Sorvall RC5B). The pellet was suspended in MSM buffer without BSA and could be stored at −70 °C. The supernatant with the cytosol and membrane was centrifuged at 100,000 units/min for 20 min at 4 °C (Rotor TLA120.2 rotor, Ultracentrifuge Optima TLX, Beckman, München, Germany). The pellet contained the membrane. The pellet with the nucleus was suspended in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 2 min at 3500 units/min at 4 °C (Rotor SS-34; Sorvall RC5B). The pellet was suspended in NB buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm pefabloc) (1 ml/108 cells) and incubated for 1 h on ice, subsequently homogenized, and applied to 10 ml of 30% sucrose in NB buffer. After the centrifugation with the Megafuge 1.0R (Heraeus Instruments) at 2000 units/min for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was washed twice with 6 ml of NB buffer, centrifuged as above, suspended in 1 ml of NB buffer, and centrifuged again at 10,000 units/min for 10 min at 4 °C (Rotor SS-34; Sorvall RC5B). The pellet could be stored at −70 °C. The proteins were separated by a large gel two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technique (gel size was 30 × 23 cm) and stained as previously described (32Thiede B. Siejak F. Dimmler C. Jungblut P. Rudel T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, isoelectric focusing rod gels were used for the first dimension with a diameter of 0.9 mm for analytical gels and 2.5 mm for preparative gels. SDS-polyacrylamide gels with 15% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.2% bisacrylamide were used for the second dimension (34Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Preparative gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or G-250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Analytical gels were stained with silver nitrate (35Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar;36Jungblut P.R. Seifert R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1990; 21: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The Coomassie Blue-stained single gel spots from Jurkat T cells were excised with a scalpel for in-gel digestion with 0.1 µg of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 20 µl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. The samples were dissolved in 1 µl of 0.5% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (2:1) for the mass spectrometric analysis. The mass spectra were recorded by using a time-of-flight delayed extraction MALDI mass spectrometer (Voyager-Elite, Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). 20 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.3% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (1:1) or 50 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 0.3% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (2:1) was used as matrix. The samples were applied to a gold-plated sample holder and introduced into the mass spectrometer after drying. The spectra were obtained in the reflectron mode by summing 70–200 laser shots. The proteins were identified by using the peptide mass fingerprinting analysis software MS-Fit (available on the World Wide Web). The NCBI and SwissProt data bases with the species human and mouse were used for the searches by considering at maximum one missed cleavage site, pyro-Glu formation at the N-terminal Gln, oxidation of methionine, acetylation of the N terminus, and modification of cysteines by acrylamide. The molecular masses and isoelectric points were calculated by employing the software Compute pI/Mw (available on the World Wide Web). The protein sequences were analyzed by searching the Pfam HMM data base (available on the World Wide Web) to identify sequence motifs. The cDNAs were cloned by a combination of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Reverse transcription was performed on poly(A)+ RNA from the human Jurkat T cell line using oligo(dT) primer. The reverse transcription products were then used as templates for PCR using specific primers according to the di-/trinucleotide sticky end cloning method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primer sequences were as follows: hnRNP A2/B1, 5′-primer TCGAGAGAGAAAAGGAACAGTTC, 3′-primer CTGGTATCGGCTCCTCCCACCATAA; hnRNP R, 5′-primer TCGCTAATCAGGTGAATGGTAATG, 3′-primer CTGCTTCCACTGTTGCCCATAAGTA; p54nrb, 5′-primer TCGAGAGTAATAAAACTTTTAAC, 3′-primer CTGGTATCGGCGACGTTTGTTTGGG; splicing factor ASF-2, 5′-primer TCGGAGGTGGTGTGATTCGTGGC, 3′-primer CTGACACTTTAGCCCATTCTGAAC; splicing factor SRp30c, 5′-primer TCGCGGGCTGGGCGGACGAGCGC, 3′-primer CTGGTAGGGCCTGAAAGGAGAGAAG; transcription factor BTF, 5′-primer TCGGACGGACAGGCGCACCCGCT, 3′-primer CTGTCAGTTTGCCTCATTCTTGGAAGC. The PCR products were treated according to the di-/trinucleotide sticky end cloning method as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then introduced into the pET28c vector (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). The cloned cDNAs were sequenced using T3 and T7 sequencing primers. The cDNAs were translated in vitro using 35S-labeled methionine with the TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). 1 µl of the translation product was cleaved with 3 µl of active lysate or 20 units of caspase-3 (BIOMOL, Hamburg, Germany) in 20 µl of cleavage buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitors pefabloc, pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) for 1 h at 37 °C. For inhibition experiments, 1 µl of 5 mmZ-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was added. The cleavage mixture was supplemented with 5 µl of loading buffer (1 µl of glycerol, 1 µl of 10% SDS, 0.25 µl of 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.075 mg of Tris-base, and 0.125 mg of bromphenol blue) and applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed, dried, and covered with a BioMaxTM MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight and then developed. Active lysate was generated from Jurkat T cells after a 6-h induction of apoptosis with 250 ng/ml αCD95 (clone CH11) (Immunotech, Marseille, France) and 1 µg/ml cycloheximide. Subsequently, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 20 min on ice with lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, 0.1% Chaps, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitors pefabloc, pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Afterward, the cells were homogenized and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 units/min (Biofuge fresco; Heraeus Instruments). The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Apoptosis was induced in Jurkat T cells by treatment with an anti-Fas antibody for 6 h. Since apoptosis is induced in the absence of protein synthesis, cycloheximide was added to the cultures in order to block protein synthesis. Prevention of protein synthesis was a prerequisite to circumvent the induction of stress proteins that are not involved in the primary apoptotic process (17Gerner C. Fröhwein U. Gotzmann J. Bayer E. Gelbmann D. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39018-39026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gels were produced after lysis of the cells and separation of the proteins. A representative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gel of anti-Fas-treated Jurkat T cells is shown in Fig.1. Approximately 2000 spots were resolved and detected by silver staining. 10 two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gels of apoptotic cells were compared with 10 two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gels of control cells (Fig.2). 24 spots were detected in patterns of apoptotic Jurkat T cells that were not present in patterns on nonapoptotic cells. 21 additional spots were observed in the pattern of control cells. Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gels were produced for the identification by mass spectrometry because the identification of proteins is not possible by the highly sensitive silver staining technique used. Only 27 of the 45 spots identified in silver-stained gels were detected in Coomassie-stained gels by comparing untreated and Fas-treated Jurkat T cells. Therefore, cytosol, mitochondria, nuclei, and membranes were purified from treated and untreated Jurkat T cells in order to enrich for the proteins that were not detected by Coomassie staining.Figure 2Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gel of Jurkat T cells.

As expected, the proteins identified in gels of control cells displayed the theoretical mass of the corresponding protein with the exception of hnRNP K. In contrast, five of the 12 proteins identified in gels of apoptotic cells, hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP R, NS1-associated protein 1, and nucleolin, showed a significantly decreased mass of more than 10% compared with the theoretical values. The masses of the remaining seven proteins, 60 S ribosomal protein P0, α NAC, hnRNP C1/C2, KH-type splicing regulatory protein, p54nrb, Rho GDI 2, and SRp30c, corresponded approximately with the theoretical masses. Fortunately, five of these proteins, 60 S ribosomal protein P0, hnRNP C1/C2, KH-type splicing regulatory protein, p54nrb, and Rho GDI 2 were found in patterns of control cells and thus allowed the direct comparison of the masses under both conditions. Using this readout, these proteins were found to exhibit lower masses in the apoptotic pattern, suggesting a modification of these proteins. We then screened the identified proteins for functional motifs. Surprisingly, 12 proteins contained the RNP motif, and three contained the KH motif (Table I), which are involved in RNA binding and processing (37Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). In order to either verify or determine the cleavage by caspases, the cDNAs of hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP R, p54nrb, the splicing factor SRp30c, the splicing factor ASF-2, and the transcription factor BTF3 were cloned and expressed in vitro. The proteins were treated with either a lysate of apoptotic Jurkat T cells (not shown), which contained a mixture of active caspases, or with the recombinant purified caspase-3 in the presence or absence of the broad range caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig.3). In most cases, the same cleavage pattern was observed for the proteins treated with the active lysate and caspase-3; however, the cleavage by caspase-3 was more efficient. Several bands were observed upon cleavage of p54nrb with caspase-3 (Fig. 3). This was unexpected, since we found only the 52-kDa fragment in apoptotic cells. Inhibition of caspase-3 with zVAD-fmk prevented the generation of all p54nrb fragments, indicating that these fragments were generated by caspase 3. Cleavage of the splicing factor ASF-2 and the transcription factor BTF3 generated two fragments, which probably corresponded to cleavage at one site (Fig.3). Since the latter factors were identified in control patterns only, cleavage by caspase-3 in vitro suggested that they were also processed in apoptotic cells. As expected from the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis results, cleavage of the splicing factor SRp30c by caspase-3 was not observed (Fig. 3). This indicated either a modification of SRp30c other than cleavage or that cleavage occurred very close to the N terminus of the protein, because the C-terminal end was identified by the mass spectrometrical analysis. The 49-kDa fragment detected in caspase-3 cleavage assays with hnRNP R (Fig. 3) confirmed the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis data. Only hnRNP A2/B1, which was fragmented in apoptotic cells, could neither be cleaved by the active lysate (not shown) nor by caspase-3 (Fig. 3). Therefore, cleavage of hnRNP A2/B1 by caspase-3 can be excluded due to the high efficiency of the enzyme. hnRNP A2/B1 might be cleaved by another protease in vivo, which is not active under the conditions used in the in vitro cleavage assay. The sites at which caspases cleaved the substrates can be calculated by taking into consideration that these enzymes cleave target proteins specifically after aspartic acids. Further parameters necessary for the prediction of cleavage sites were the sequence coverage of the peptide mass fingerprints, the difference of the theoretical and the detected molecular masses, and the pI values of the proteins that were identified in patterns of apoptotic cells. For the splicing factor ASF-2 and the transcription factor BTF, which were not found in patterns of apoptotic cells, the cleavage site could be predicted by means of the in vitro cleavage assay (Fig. 4, TableII).Table IIPrediction of cleavage sitesProteinSequence coverageStart-end amino acidsMasspIMass foundpI foundPutative cleavage sitekDakDa60 S ribosomal protein P011–2641–31033.36.5N33.5N5.8SDED1–30833.55.9P33.3P6.1EESD6–31733.65.9PREDhnRNP A115–1781–28830.58.4P32.1P8.5GSYD1–31432.98.4SYNDhnRNP A2/B1102–338/35037/49–341/35331.59.1/8.9N36.4N9.0KLTD44/56–341/35330.89.2P29.9P9.3VMRD64/76–341/35328.59.0/8.8AEVDhnRNP C1/C218–138/1511–285/29831.6/32.95.1N36.3N5.0DDRD1–283/29631.3/32.65.1P35.3P5.4GEDD1–282/29531.2/32.55.1/5.2EGED11–290/30330.9/32.25.1NKTDhnRNP R134–44167–47245.97.2P49.1P7.3RAID + DYYD88–48144.77.2KESD + DYHDKH-type splicing regulatory protein122–64673–71167.36.9N78.9N6.5IRKD77–71166.97.3P72.0P6.9AFAD92–71165.46.7IGGD103–71164.36.9STPD115–71162.96.9QLED117–71162.87.3EDGD129–71161.57.1SQGDNS1-associated protein 139–3811–46852.85.7P54.1P6.1DYYD1–46552.35.7GYED1–45951.55.9YPPDNucleolin458–624454–62819.45.0P18.1P5.2TEID + AMED454–63219.84.9TEID + GEIDp54nrb76–3361–42249.28.4N55.9N8.5MMPDP52.3P8.1Rho GDI 222–19622–19620.96.2N23.1P6.2DELDP22.1SF ASF-21–17619.3C19.4RKLD150–29217.0C17.3DLKD1–15616.9VYRD1–15216.4CYADSF SRp30c9–2217–22124.98.9P27.3P8.6GWADTF BTF31–17518.9C18.3QSVDThe putative cleavage sites for caspases were calculated by the theoretical masses of fragments generated by cleavage after aspartic acids.

It has been proposed that this binding event is responsible for the rapid and specific localization of sporozoites to the liver after their injection into the skin by an infected anopheline mosquito. Previous in vitro studies performed under static conditions have failed to demonstrate a significant role for heparan sulfate proteoglycans during sporozoite invasion of cells. We performed sporozoite attachment and invasion assays under more dynamic conditions and found a dramatic decrease in sporozoite attachment to cells in the presence of heparin. In contrast to its effect on attachment, heparin does not appear to have an effect on sporozoite invasion of cells. When substituted heparins were used as competitive inhibitors of sporozoite attachment, we found that sulfation of the glycosaminoglycan chains at both the N- and O-positions was important for sporozoite adhesion to cells. We conclude that the binding of the circumsporozoite protein to hepatic heparan sulfate proteoglycans is likely to function during sporozoite attachment in the liver and that this adhesion event depends on the sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains of the proteoglycans.

Malaria infection is initiated when an infected anopheline mosquito injects sporozoites during a blood meal. The injected sporozoites travel to the liver and invade hepatocytes where they develop into exoerythrocytic forms. The speed and specificity of sporozoite localization to hepatocytes suggest a receptor-mediated event. Previous studies have shown that the major sporozoite surface protein, the circumsporozoite protein (CS),1 binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the hepatocyte surface and in the space of Disse (reviewed in Ref. 1Sinnis P. Sim B.K.L. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating CS binding to HSPGs, the function of this binding event in the life of the sporozoite remains unknown. In vivo experiments with recombinant CS have shown that intravenously injected protein is rapidly cleared from the circulation by HSPGs of hepatocytes (2Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3Sinnis P. Willnow T.E. Briones M.R.S. Herz J. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CS may mediate the rapid clearance of the sporozoites by hepatocytes. In vivo experiments with sporozoites that could prove this point, however, have been difficult to perform. To date, remnant lipoproteins (ligands for hepatic HSPGs) and sulfated glycoconjugates such as fucoidan and dextran sulfate have been shown to decrease sporozoite infectivity in vivo (3Sinnis P. Willnow T.E. Briones M.R.S. Herz J. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Pancake S.J. Holt G.H. Mellouk S. Hoffman S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 6: 1351-1357Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effect on sporozoite infectivity, while demonstrating that the CS-HSPG interaction is important, does not indicate if the glycan is required for sporozoite attachment, invasion, or subsequent development in hepatocytes. In vitro assays (5Renia L. Miltgen F. Charoenvit Y. Ponnudurai T. Verhave J.P. Collins W.E. Mazier D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 112: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Frevert U. Sinnis P. Esko J.D. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have been used to determine whether the CS-HSPG interaction is critical for cell invasion. Frevert et al. (6Frevert U. Sinnis P. Esko J.D. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) found that removal of the majority of cell surface HSPGs had a minimal inhibitory effect on sporozoite invasion of cells. One interpretation of these data is that the binding of CS to HSPGs does not function during sporozoite invasion. Another possibility, however, is that CS binding to HSPGs functions in the more dynamic conditions found in the blood circulation and leads to arrest of sporozoites in the liver sinusoids. In this paper we modify the standard sporozoite invasion assay and provide evidence that the interaction between CS and cell surface HSPGs functions during the initial attachment of sporozoites to cells under conditions that mimic flow. In addition, we show that the sulfate moieties of the HSPG glycosaminoglycan chains (GAGs) are important for attachment of sporozoites to cells. Plasmodium bergheiand Plasmodium yoelii, two species of rodent malaria, were maintained in the laboratory using Anopheles stephensimosquitoes and mice (7Vanderberg J.P. Gwadz R.W. Kreier J. Malaria: Pathology, Vector Studies, and Culture. Academic Press, New York1980: 154-218Google Scholar). Sporozoites were obtained from salivary glands of infected mosquitoes on the day of the experiment. All invasion assays were performed with P. berghei that invades cellsin vitro with higher efficiency than P. yoelii. Both P. berghei and P. yoelii were used in attachment assays as indicated in the figure legends. We used HepG2 cells (ATCC HB8065, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), a hepatoma cell line permissive for P. berghei sporozoite development in vitro, for all CS protein binding assays and for sporozoite invasion and attachment assays. Cells were maintained as described previously (3Sinnis P. Willnow T.E. Briones M.R.S. Herz J. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used were directed against the repetitive region of the respective CS protein as follows: mAb 3D11, P. berghei CS (8Yoshida N. Nussenzweig R.S. Potocnjak P. Nussenzweig V.

The Escherichia coli-derived CS27IVC represents the complete P. falciparum CS sequence from the T4 isolate, except that the hydrophobic NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acids 1–26 and 412–424 have been deleted, and 5 histidine residues have been added to the COOH terminus to facilitate purification (11Takacs B.J. Girard M.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 143: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein used in these studies was kindly provided by Dr. Bela Takacs (Hoffmann-La Roche). Intact and modified forms of hog mucosal heparin were obtained from Glycomed, Inc. (Alameda, CA).N-Desulfation of heparin was achieved by mild solvolysis (12Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); 2-O,3-O-desulfated heparin was prepared according to the method of Jaseja et al. (14Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1456Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar); and carboxy-reduced heparin was made by borohydride reduction in the presence of carbodiimide (15Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (3 × 105 cells/ml) were plated (0.4 ml/well) in labtek chamber slides (model 177445, Nalgene Nunc Corp., Naperville, IL) and allowed to grow until subconfluent (36–48 h). On the day of the experiment, the medium was removed, and an equal number of sporozoites in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM/FCS) were added to each well. Because sporozoites are obtained from mosquito salivary glands and the efficiency of salivary gland infection varies on a weekly basis, different numbers of sporozoites were used for each experiment. The number of sporozoites added per well varied between 20,000 and 80,000, although within a given experiment identical numbers of sporozoites were added to each well. The slides were incubated at 37 °C under static or rotating conditions. Rotating conditions were created by taping the labtek chamber slide to a clinical rotator (Fisher) set at 200 rpm. After 1 h, unattached sporozoites were removed, and the slides were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 130 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.4) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with cold methanol for 10 min, washed twice with TBS, and blocked for 1 h with TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (TBS/BSA). Sporozoites were visualized with the appropriate monoclonal antibody (10 µg/ml in TBS/BSA) and goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to FITC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Slides were mounted in Citifluor mounting medium (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) and counted on a fluorescence microscope using a 40× objective lens and 15× eyepieces. Each point was plated in triplicate wells, and 50–60 fields per well were counted. When heparin was used as an inhibitor, sporozoites were preincubated in DMEM/FCS ± heparin for 15 min on ice and then plated on cells in the presence of heparin. For experiments with chlorate-treated cells, HepG2 cells were plated in DMEM/FCS, and 48 h later the medium was changed to low sulfate medium (see below) with the indicated concentrations of chlorate. In wells with 20 mm chlorate and 20 mm chlorate + 20 mm magnesium sulfate, an appropriate amount of medium was replaced with water in order to maintain normal osmolarity. After 24 h, the chlorate-containing medium was removed; sporozoites in DMEM/FCS were added, and the assay was carried out as outlined above. Sporozoite attachment under laminar flow was studied using a parallel plate flow chamber. HepG2 cells were cultured until confluent on tissue culture-treated Petri dishes, and a customized flow chamber was assembled on the well of the dish forming a 3.18-mm wide and 25-µm high flow channel on the cell monolayer. The wall shear stress was calculated as a function of flow rate. Medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 2% BSA and 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4) ± sporozoites was drawn through the chamber at controlled flow rates with a syringe pump (model 22; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) attached to the outlet. The assay consisted of four steps: 1) 5-min prerinse with medium at 0.4 ml/min; 2) infusion of 5 × 105 sporozoites (in 750 µl) into the inlet tubing (0.4 ml/min) followed by sporozoite perfusion of the cells at the indicated flow rate (the time of the perfusion was inversely proportional to the flow rate so that for each point an equal number of sporozoites was allowed to perfuse over the cell monolayer); 3) 6-min rinse with medium at 0.05 ml/min to remove nonadherent sporozoites; and 4) a variable period of stasis so that for each point the sporozoites had a total of 20 min of cell contact before fixation. After each assay the flow chamber was removed, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and sporozoites were stained as outlined above. The flow chamber, cells, and medium were kept on a slide warmer at 37 °C; and the room in which the assay was performed was maintained at 30 °C since sporozoites do not attach to cells at temperatures below 25 °C. 2P. Sinnis, unpublished data. This assay is identical to the sporozoite attachment assay except that cells were stained with a double-staining procedure that allows differentiation of intracellular and extracellular sporozoites (5Renia L. Miltgen F. Charoenvit Y. Ponnudurai T. Verhave J.P. Collins W.E. Mazier D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 112: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Frevert U. Sinnis P. Esko J.D. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with mAb 3D11 (directed against the repeat region of P. berghei CS) followed by goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to colloidal gold 10 nm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were then permeabilized with methanol and stained again with mAb 3D11 followed by goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to FITC. The colloidal gold label was revealed with a silver enhancement kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each field was counted under simultaneous fluorescence and low-light bright field microscopy. All sporozoites were FITC-positive, whereas only extracellular sporozoites appeared black. The percentage of sporozoites that invaded the cells was calculated using the following equation: total parasites−extracellular parasitestotal parasites×100=%invasionFor the experiments with cytochalasin D (Sigma), the sporozoites were preincubated in DMEM/FCS ± 1 µm cytochalasin (± heparin) for 15 min at room temperature and then plated on cells in the presence of cytochalasin. For the cytochalasin recovery experiments, sporozoites were preincubated in DMEM/FCS with 1 µm cytochalasin and added to cells in the presence of cytochalasin for 30 min at 37 °C. Following this, the medium was removed and replaced with DMEM/FCS, without cytochalasin, containing different concentrations of heparin. Controls included sporozoites treated exactly as outlined above except that all incubations (preincubation, incubation with cells with initial medium, and incubation of cells with replacement medium) were performed in either (a) DMEM/FCS with no cytochalasin or heparin or (b) DMEM/FCS with cytochalasin but no heparin. After 1 h at 37 °C, all cells were fixed and stained with the double-staining procedure outlined above. 2 × 105cells/well were plated into 6-well plates (Corning Glass) and grown for 12 h in DMEM/FCS with various concentrations of chlorate (sodium salt; Aldrich). In wells with 10 and 20 mm chlorate, an appropriate amount of medium was replaced with water in order to maintain normal osmolarity. After 12 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 2 ml/well of low sulfate medium (Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mmglutamine, and 2% FCS that had been dialyzed extensivelyversus 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) with the indicated amount of chlorate and 100 µCi of carrier-free Na235SO4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 12 h, the cells were transferred to 4 °C, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with lysis buffer (130 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 µg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin) for 5 min. The lysate was transferred to Eppendorf tubes; the wells were washed once, and the wash was added to the lysate that was spun at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Both pellet and supernatant were counted in a Beckman LS 7500 scintillation counter. Over 95% of the counts/min were found in the supernatant. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. Lysates from chlorate-treated cells were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide slab gels. Equivalent amounts of protein were loaded onto each lane. The gels were fixed with 10% glacial acetic acid and 30% methanol, impregnated for 30 min in 1m salicylic acid, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. 105 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates (Removawell tissue culture plates, Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) and allowed to grow for 18 h. In the experiments investigating CS binding to chlorate-treated cells, the cells were grown in low sulfate medium with the indicated concentrations of chlorate. In the experiments with the substituted heparins, the cells were grown in DMEM/FCS. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed three times with TBS, and blocked with TBS/BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. In the binding experiments with chlorate-treated cells, varying concentrations of CS in TBS/BSA were added to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with mAb 2A10 (10 µg/ml) followed by anti-mouse Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound enzyme was revealed by the addition of substrate (2,2′-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 1 h, absorbance at 405 nm was read in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. In the experiments using the substituted heparins as inhibitors of CS binding, 5 µg/ml CS was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of heparin for 30 min at 37 °C. These solutions were then added to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C; the cells were washed, and 200,000 cpm/well of iodinated mAb 2A10 was added for 30 min at 37 °C. The plates were washed 3 times, and wells were counted in a gamma counter. Previous studies have failed to demonstrate a significant role for HSPGs during sporozoite invasion of cells (6Frevert U. Sinnis P. Esko J.D. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since sporozoites are in the blood circulation when they contact HSPGs in the liver, we reasoned that heparin might be a better inhibitor of sporozoite invasion of cells under conditions that mimic flow. We created shear force between sporozoites in liquid medium and immobilized target cells by placing the experimental chamber on a rotator. We then compared sporozoite attachment to cells in the presence and absence of heparin, under static and rotating conditions. As shown in Fig. 1 A, heparin is a much more potent inhibitor of sporozoite attachment under rotating conditions compared with static conditions. Inhibition of attachment under rotating conditions is dose-dependent and reaches a maximum of 85% with 25–50 µg/ml heparin (Fig. 1 B). Under static conditions, increasing the concentration of heparin does not increase its inhibitory activity beyond 15–25% (Fig. 1 B). Importantly, sporozoite attachment to cells is not significantly altered under rotating conditions in the absence of inhibitor (Fig.1 A). When the cells with the sporozoites are rotated, the medium moves with respect to the cells that are adhering to the bottom of the wells, and a shear force is generated. In a rotating system, however, the shear force is not readily measurable. To circumvent this problem, we performed a sporozoite attachment assay in a parallel plate flow chamber. As shown in Fig. 2, at physiologic shear forces (0.75–2 dynes/cm2) heparin is a better inhibitor of sporozoite attachment compared with a very low shear force of 0.25 dynes/cm2. 3We used a very low shear force instead of static conditions because it was technically not feasible to perform a static assay in our flow chamber. Thus, similar results were obtained in both systems. In the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2, we did not distinguish between intracellular and extracellular parasites because the cells were permeabilized before the sporozoites were stained. Since sporozoites must attach to cells before entry, we reasoned that attachment occurs by the same mechanism regardless of whether sporozoites have entered the cells. In order to confirm this, we performed the assay in the presence of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of sporozoite invasion but not attachment (16Stewart M.J. Nawrot R.J. Schulman S. Vanderberg J.P. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 859-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sinnis P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 221: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). By using a double-staining procedure that enables us to distinguish intracellular from extracellular sporozoites, we found no intracellular sporozoites in the presence of cytochalasin, whereas without cytochalasin the invasion rate was ∼40% (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3, cytochalasin-treated sporozoites attached with approximately the same frequency as untreated sporozoites. In addition, the inhibitory effect of heparin on sporozoite attachment was more dramatic under rotating conditions, regardless of whether cytochalasin was present in the medium. It appears, therefore, that sporozoite attachment to cells is a separate, distinguishable phase of cell invasion and that heparin acts on the attachment phase of sporozoite entry into cells. We then went on to determine the effect of heparin on sporozoite invasion of HepG2 cells under both rotating and static conditions. Results from three experiments indicate that heparin does not have a significant effect on sporozoite invasion of cells (Fig.4 A). These experiments were performed using a double-staining procedure that distinguishes between intracellular and extracellular sporozoites, and invasion efficiency is expressed as a percentage of total sporozoites bound. Since, as one would expect, the total number of sporozoites bound to cells in the presence of heparin under rotating conditions is low, the absolute number of intracellular sporozoites in these wells is also low. However, the percentage of total sporozoites that are found intracellularly is the same as in the other groups, suggesting that once the sporozoite has attached to the cell, heparin does not affect its ability to enter. In order to confirm our findings that heparin does not inhibit sporozoite invasion of cells, we used cytochalasin D to separate attachment from invasion of cells. Sporozoites were allowed to attach to cells in the presence of cytochalasin and then the drug was removed. We have found that sporozoites incubated with cytochalasin can, upon its removal, recover from its effects and invade cells (Fig.4 C). Recovery appears to be a stochastic process that begins immediately upon cytochalasin removal and reaches a maximum after ∼30 min. However, only 30–50% of the sporozoites recover and are able to invade cells (Fig. 4 C). This is likely because incubation of sporozoites with cytochalasin is performed at 37 °C, and it has been shown that sporozoites lose between 60 and 100% of their infectivity after 1–2 h at 37 °C (18Vanderberg J.P. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We performed the cytochalasin recovery experiment under static conditions because our previous data indicated that rotation had no effect on invasion efficiency (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig.4 C, when heparin was added to the medium after sporozoite attachment to cells, it did not significantly inhibit sporozoite invasion. As expected, sporozoite attachment was the same in all groups because cytochalasin does not inhibit sporozoites from attaching to cells, and heparin was added after sporozoite attachment had occurred (Fig. 4 B). When sporozoites were added to the cells in medium without cytochalasin, the invasion rate was 2–3-fold higher compared with sporozoites that were initially incubated with the cells in the presence of cytochalasin (Fig. 4 C). As stated above, this is likely due to a loss of sporozoite infectivity during the time in which the sporozoites were allowed to attach to but not invade the cells. Previous studies have shown that CS binds to the glycosaminoglycan chains (GAGs) and not the protein core of HSPGs (19Frevert U. Sinnis P. Cerami C. Shreffler W. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, CS binds to regions of the GAGs that are more highly sulfated (20Ying P. Shakibaei M. Patankar M. Clavijo P. Beavis R.C. Clark G.F. Frevert U. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Gantt S.M. Clavijo P. Bai X. Esko J.D. Sinnis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19205-19213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In order to determine more precisely if CS binds to the sulfated domains of the GAGs, we performed CS binding assays with HepG2 cells in which the sulfation of the HSPGs was decreased by treating cells with sodium chlorate. Chlorate inhibits ATP-sulfurylase, the first enzyme in the synthesis of the high energy donor of sulfate, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPs). Previous studies have shown that chlorate inhibits sulfation of cellular proteins and carbohydrates without affecting cell growth or protein synthesis (22Humphries D.E. Silbert J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Baeuerie P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 24Hortin G.L. Schilling M. Graham J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we show that the effect of chlorate on HepG2 cells is similar to what has been reported previously for other cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5, chlorate causes a dose-dependent decrease in [35S]sulfate incorporation into cellular macromolecules of HepG2 cells. Although many proteins and carbohydrates can be sulfated, previous studies have shown that most free sulfate is incorporated into proteoglycans (25Underhill C.B. Keller J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 90: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is likely also true for HepG2 cells since we found that the sulfate-labeled material ran as a high molecular weight smear on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (inset, Fig. 5), consistent with its being predominantly composed of proteoglycans. We found no differences in cell growth or protein synthesis in cells incubated in chlorate (data not shown). We investigated CS binding to chlorate-treated cells and found a dose-dependent decrease in CS binding (Fig.6 A). When cells were incubated in medium containing chlorate and an equimolar amount of sulfate, there was no effect on CS binding (inset, Fig. 6 A), suggesting that chlorate is not toxic to the cells, and its effect on CS binding is due to its inhibition of sulfation. These studies, taken together with previous results showing that CS binds to HSPGs on the surface of HepG2 cells (6Frevert U. Sinnis P. Esko J.D. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Frevert U. Sinnis P. Cerami C. Shreffler W. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), suggest that CS binding is correlated with the degree of sulfation of the HSPG GAGs. In order to determine whether specific sulfate moieties were important for CS binding, we used modified heparins as inhibitors of CS binding to HepG2 cells. These heparins are selectively desulfated in either theN- or O-positions. As shown in Fig.6 B, both 2-O,3-O-desulfated heparin and N-desulfated heparin inhibited CS binding to HepG2 cells less well than the parent compound. In addition, the more fully desulfated compound (2-O,3-O-desulfated andN-desulfated heparin) had very little inhibitory activity. These results suggest that both N- and O-sulfate moieties participate in CS binding. Results using carboxy-reduced heparin as an inhibitor were somewhat surprising. As shown in Fig. 6 B, this was a weak inhibitor of CS binding to HSPGs. At physiologic pH the carboxyl groups of the GAGs are negatively charged, and our results suggest that they participate, along with the sulfate moieties, in binding to CS. To extend these findings and determine whether the requirements for CS binding to cells parallel the requirements for sporozoite attachment, we tested the ability of sporozoites to attach to chlorate-treated HepG2 cells under static and rotating conditions. As shown in Fig. 7, chlorate treatment of HepG2 cells results in a dose-dependent decrease in sporozoite attachment, and as expected, the effect is much more dramatic under rotating conditions compared with static conditions. Cells incubated with chlorate and an equimolar amount of sulfate showed no inhibition of sporozoite attachment under static or rotating conditions (inset,"

Here we report that the two known binding partners of hBUB3, the mitotic checkpoint proteins hBUB1 and hBUBR1, both carry a region with remarkable similarity to the GLEBS motif of hNUP98.

It is a widely accepted view that mRNA molecules exit the nucleus as mRNA protein (mRNP) particles and that certain mRNA-associated proteins provide signals for mRNP export (5Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G.

Several lines of evidence support the notion that the human WD repeat protein RAE1 (hRAE1 (7Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J.

First, the temperature-sensitive mutants of spRae1p (9Brown J.A. Bharathi A. Ghosh A. Whalen W. Fitzgerald E. Dhar R. J. Biol.

Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7471-7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), hRAE1 can be cross-linked to polyadenylated RNA by UV irradiation (8Kraemer D. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9119-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), implying that hRAE1 and mRNA interact directly or via another protein. Third, hRAE1 binds to TAP, a human mRNA-binding protein that propels export of mRNAs and specific constitutive transport element-bearing viral RNAs (12Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N.

Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The GLEBS motif was first identified within the budding yeast nucleoporin scNup116p, where it serves as a docking site for scGle2p at the NPC (13Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A. Hellwig A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The GLEBS motifs of Nup116p and NUP98 are necessary and sufficient for binding to scGle2p and hRAE1 (7Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), respectively. hRAE1 binds to the GLEBS motif of NUP98 through multiple domains, including the WD propeller and part of the carboxyl-terminal non-WD repeat extension (7Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). RAE1 is very homologous to the mitotic checkpoint control protein BUB3. Their homology is not confined to the four WD repeat motifs; it extends over the entire protein length and is particularly high in the central non-WD repeat region that separates WD repeats 3 and 4 (14Martinez-Exposito M.J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). BUB3 was originally discovered in a mutant of S. cerevisiae that failed to arrest in the cell cycle when treated with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug benomyl (16Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T. Cell. 1991; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Six other mitotic control proteins were discovered in a similar fashion: MAD1, MAD2, and MAD3 (17Li R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar); BUB1 and BUB2 (16Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T.

Science. 1996; 273: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) that phosphorylate BUB3 and MAD1, respectively (20Roberts B.T. Farr K.A. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8282-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), suggesting that checkpoint function requires a phosphorylation-based signal transduction pathway (22Bernard P. Hardwick K.

In mammalian cells, BUB3 binds to the mitotic checkpoint proteins BUB1 and BUBR1 via an unknown molecular mechanism (14Martinez-Exposito M.J. Kaplan K.B. Copeland J. Sorger P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8493-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 24Jablonski S.A. Chan G.K. Cooke C.A. Earnshaw W.C. Yen T.J. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is known that BUB3, BUB1, and BUBR1 concentrate at kinetochores of mammalian prometaphase chromosomes as part of a larger protein complex serving in mitotic checkpoint control (25Kalitsis P. Earle E. Fowler K.J. Choo K.H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2277-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The observation that hBUB1 is localized at kinetochores of human osteosarcoma cells in early prophase, when levels of BUBR1 at kinetochores are still unremarkable, indicates that hBUB1 and hBUBR1 may dock sequentially to kinetochores of cells undergoing mitosis. In mitotic cells, hBUBR1 binds to the CENP-E (-centromere-associated protein E) (26Chan G.K. Jablonski S.A. Sudakin V. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 941-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), which has led to the idea that BUBR1 is a kinetochore-associated adaptor protein that facilitates the recruitment of CENP-E to kinetochores (27Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Here we report that mammalian BUB1 and hBUBR1 proteins contain a GLEBS similar to the nucleoporin hNUP98. We show that mBUB1- and mBUBR1-derived GLEBS motifs, which are identical to those found in hBUB1 and hBUBR1, are sufficient for mBUB3 binding. We also demonstrate that hRAE1 (and mRAE1) can cross-interact with the GLEBS motif of mBUB1 and that it has the ability to associate with kinetochores of prometaphase chromosomes. The presence of GLEBS motifs in both transport factors and regulators of mitosis and the ability of RAE1 to bind to GLEBS motifs in both NUP98 and BUB1 provide a novel molecular basis for a potential interplay between nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic machines in mammalian cells. mBUB3 cDNA was generated by PCR amplification from DNA clone AI316795 (obtained from the IMAGE consortium; Genome Systems Inc.) using the primer pair 5′-TATGCTAGCATGACCGGTTCGAACGAATT-3′ and 5′-TATGCTAGCATGCACGATTTGAACACTGA-3′. mBUB1 cDNA was PCR-amplified from a mouse macrophage cDNA library using the primer pair 5′-ATCCCGCTAGCATGGACAACCTAGAAAATGTCTTTCGCA-3′ and 5′-ATCCCTCTAGATTATTTTCTTGAACGCTTATATTCTG-3′. This clone was used to generate mBUB1-GLEBS (229) and mBUB1-GLEBS (209) via PCR amplification using the primer pairs 5′-TATGCTAGCAAGCCTGAGGCTCAGCAAGT-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGATCACTCATGCTTCTTCCTTTGAT-3′; and 5′-TATGCTAGCGAACAAAGGGTGATCATGATTTC-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGATCACTCTTCAAAAGCATTTGCTT-3′, respectively. mBUBR1-GLEBS (382) and mBUBR1-GLEBS (362) were PCR-amplified from mBUBR1 cDNA (28Davenport J.W. Fernandes E.R. Harris L.D. Neale G.A. Goorha R. Genomics. 1999; 55: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using primer pairs 5′-CCCGAATTCGCCGCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGAT-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGATCATCGTTCTTTCAGCTTCTTTC-3′; and 5′-AAGGCTAGCAGGAAGCCAGGGAGAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-CCCTCTAGATCATTCCGATCTGCTTCTGCATCT-3′, respectively. All PCR products were cloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequence analysis. The “Tet-Off” gene expression system (CLONTECH) was used to express mBUB3, mBUB1, mBUBR1, mRAE1, and mutants thereof. Ectopically expressed proteins had either a HA1 or a FLAG tag fused to their amino terminus. Expression vectors were transfected into HeLa-tTA (Tet-Off-HeLa) cells (29Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). Forin vitro transcription and translation purposes, mBUB3, mBUB1, or HA1-mRAE1 (7Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) cDNAs were cloned into pGEM3 or pSP73. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were produced using the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as described previously (7Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 and HeLa-tTA cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum and transfected with Superfect (Qiagen). Typically, the cells were analyzed 24–40 h after transfection. To induce prometaphase arrest, the cells were cultured in the presence of 2.5-µmnocodazole for a 16-h period starting 24 h after transfection. For indirect immunofluorescence purposes, nocodazole-treated cells were trypsinized and immobilized on multi-well slides coated with polyethylene amine. To generate BUB3-specific antibodies, mBUB3 sequences encoding amino acids 145–276 were cloned into pQE31 (Qiagen). His-tagged recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH12S cells, purified with nickel- nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and injected into rabbits. BUB3 antiserum was affinity-purified using His-mBUB3(145–276) recombinant protein immobilized on ProBlot (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (30van Deursen J. Boer J. Kasper L. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5574-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Injecting rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides RNRLIVMLSEYKRSRK (mBUB1 residues 1023–1038), TQQDKQPGGSQSPA (mBUBR1 residues 1039–1052), IRQVTDAETKPKSPCT (h/mBUB3 residues 313–327), and FYNPQKKNYIFLRNAAEE (h/mRAE1 residues 344–361) generated mBUB1-, mBUBR1-, h/mBUB3-, and h/mRAE1-specific antibodies, respectively. The generation and purification of antibodies against hBUB1 have been described previously (24Jablonski S.A. Chan G.K. Cooke C.A. Earnshaw W.C. Yen T.J. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The peptides were coupled to Sepharose 4B beads and used for affinity purification of antibodies from serum. We verified the specificity of new batches of affinity-purified antibody via Western blot analyses using NIH-3T3 and HeLa cell lysates. As expected, anti-mBUB1(1023–1038) and anti-mBUBR1(1039–1052) antibodies recognized mBUB1 and mBUBR1, respectively, but not their human counterparts, whereas anti-h/mRAE1(344–361) bound to both mouse and human RAE1. It should be noted that our mBUB3(145–276) and h/mBUB3(313–327) antibodies, both of which recognize hBUB3 and mBUB3 (data not shown) failed to detect kinetochore-associated fractions of endogenous and ectopically expressed FLAG-mBUB3 in nocodazole-treated HeLa-tTA cells, although these antibodies can easily detect these proteins in interphase cells (not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitations, and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (31Kasper L.H. Brindle P.K. Schnabel C.A. Pritchard C.E.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was used in a 1:10,000 dilution. cDNA fragments encoding mBUB1(229–266) and mBUBR1(382–420) were cloned into plasmid pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant proteins. Expression and purification of GST-mBUB1(229–266), GST-mBUBR1(382–420), GST-hNUP98(150–223), and His-hNUP98(181–224) and performance of pull-down assays were as described previously (7Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Data base searches indicated that the GLEBS motif of scNUP116p (13Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A. Hellwig A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) has very strong homology to hBUB1 residues 249–264 (69% identity; Fig. 1 A). These residues were positioned within a 38-amino acid hBUB1 segment that has been demonstrated to be necessary for interaction with the RAE1-related protein mBUB3 (15Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J.

Therefore, we produced [35S]methionine-labeled mBUB3 via the former approach and used it in a pull-down experiment with a GST fusion protein containing mBUB1 residues 229–266 (referred to as GST-mBUB1-GLEBS) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. We found that mBUB3 bound to GST-mBUB1-GLEBS in this assay (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) but not to GST alone (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). In contrast, mBUB3 did not bind to a GST fusion protein containing the hNUP98 GLEBS (residues 184–224; Fig. 1 B, lane 6, a recombinant protein that strongly binds to in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled mRAE1 (Fig. 1 C,lane 5). The GLEBS homology region of mBUB1 shares extensive homology (50% identity and 75% similarity) with residues 403–418 of another BUB3-binding protein, mBUBR1 (15Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J.

Genomics. 1999; 55: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This prompted us to generate a GST fusion protein containing mBUBR1 residues 382–420 (named GST-mBUBR1-GLEBS) and test its affinity for BUB3. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B (lane 2), GST-mBUBR1-GLEBS was indeed able to interact with mBUB3 in vitro. Together, the above experiments indicate that both mBUB1 and mBUBR1 contain a GLEBS-like motif that is sufficient for mBUB3 binding. The finding that mBUB3 does not interact with the hNUP98 GLEBS demonstrates that this WD repeat protein interacts with a specific subset of GLEBS-containing proteins. To verify whether hBUB3 can form a stable complex with the GLEBS motif of mBUB1 in mammalian cells, lysates were prepared from HeLa-tTA cells expressing a HA1-tagged mBUB1-GLEBS. The lysates were incubated with anti-HA1 antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose, and the immunoprecipitates were examined by Western blot analysis. Both HA1-mBUB1-GLEBS and hBUB3 were present in anti-HA1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). In contrast, anti-HA1 immunocomplexes obtained from lysates of HeLa-tTA cells overexpressing a HA1-tagged mBUBR1-GLEBS contained the GLEBS motif but no hBUB3 (Fig.1 C, lane 2). However, when HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS and a FLAG-tagged mBUB3 were coexpressed in HeLa-tTA cells, anti-HA1 immunoprecipitates contained both the GLEBS motif and FLAG-mBUB3 (Fig.1 C, lane 4). Although mBUBR1-GLEBS binding to BUB3 requires ectopic expression of mBUB3, the above experiments in HeLa-tTA cells confirm that the GLEBS motifs of the mitotic checkpoint proteins mBUB1 and mBUBR1 are sufficient for BUB3 binding in vivo. We examined the subcellular distribution of the BUB1- and mBUBR1-GLEBS motifs in mitotic and nonmitotic HeLa-tTA cells. In interphase, both HA1-mBUB1-GLEBS (Fig. 2,A and B) and HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS (Fig. 2,I and J) were located predominantly in the nuclear compartment, although significant amounts of both motifs were also observed in the cytoplasm. In cells that had been arrested in prometaphase with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole, HA1-mBUB1-GLEBS staining patterns were punctate (Fig. 2 C) and almost perfectly overlapping with the punctate anti-hBUB1 (Fig.2 D) and anti-kinetochore (Fig. 2 E) staining patterns observed in these cells (≥50 prometaphases were examined in detail by confocal microscopy; generally ≥80–90% of the anti-HA1 signals in the confocal images displayed clear overlap with an anti-hBUB1/anti-kinetochore signal). High resolution images of these stainings are shown in Fig. 2 (H–H′′′). By contrast, the HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS staining patterns in prometaphase cells (Fig.2 K; ≥50 prometaphases were studied in detail) had no discernable overlap with the punctate anti-hBUB1 (Fig. 2 L) and anti-kinetochores staining patterns (Fig. 2 M). High resolution confocal images are shown in Fig. 2 (P–P′′′). Because ectopic expression of FLAG-mBUB3 is required for coprecipitation of HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS and BUB3 in HeLa-tTA cells (as shown in Fig. 1 C, lane 3), we wanted to determine whether HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS would target to kinetochores in the presence of ectopically expressed FLAG-mBUB3. Therefore, we cotransfected HeLa-tTA cells with HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS and FLAG-mBUB3 and double-stained them with anti-HA1 and anti-kinetochore antibodies after a 6-h period of nocodazole treatment. Analysis of 25 prometaphases by confocal microscopy revealed that only a small proportion of the kinetochores (∼5–20%; Fig. 2 R) presented HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS staining (Fig. 2 Q; for details see Fig. 2, U–U′′′). The intensities of the kinetochore-associated HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS signals were relatively weak compared with those of HA1-mBUB1-GLEBS (compare Fig. 2,C and Q). As illustrated in Fig. 2(V–X), FLAG-mBUB3 was able to bind efficiently to kinetochores of nocodazole-treated HeLa-tTA cells. When we costained such FLAG-mBUB3 expressing cells with anti-FLAG antibodies and either BUB3-specific antibodies raised against mBUB3(145–276) or antibodies against mBUB3(313–327), no kinetochore-specific punctate signals were obtained with both anti-mBUB3(145–276) and anti-mBUB3(313–327) antibodies. This result suggests that BUB3 epitopes recognized by mBUB3(145–276) and BUB3(313–327) antibodies are likely to be unexposed when BUB3 is bound to kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes, although both antibody samples readily detect endogenous hBUB3 as well as FLAG-mBUB3 in interphase cells (data not shown). Because of this epitope-masking phenomenon, we did not perform a BUB3 detection on nocodazole-treated HeLa-tTA cells cotransfected with HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS and FLAG-mBUB3. Together, the above localization studies indicate that the mBUB1-GLEBS, but not the mBUBR1-GLEBS, has the ability to target efficiently to kinetochores in prometaphase cells. We determined whether mRAE1 was able to bind to the GLEBS-like motifs of mBUB1 and mBUBR1 because of the high degree of homology between mBUB3 and mRAE1. As illustrated in Fig.3 , in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled mRAE1 bound to both GST-mBUB1-GLEBS (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) and GST-mBUBR1-GLEBS (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) in a pull-down assay. Anti-HA1 immunoprecipitates from HeLa-tTA cells overexpressing HA1-mBUB1-GLEBS revealed that the GLEBS motif of mBUB1 was able to interact in vivo endogenous hRAE1 (Fig. 3 B,lane 1). Conversely, when HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS was overexpressed in HeLa-tTA cells, it did not bind to endogenous hRAE1 (Fig.3 B, lane 2). Furthermore, coexpression of FLAG-mRAE1 with HA1-mBUBR1-GLEBS did not result in a detectable interaction (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). We note that anti-HA1 immunoprecipitates from HeLa-tTA cells that we cotransfected with HA1-mBUB1-GLEBS and FLAG-mRAE1 expression plasmids contained exclusively FLAG-mRAE1. This result indicates that ectopically expressed FLAG-mRAE1 protein competes effectively with endogenous hRAE1 and hBUB3 for binding to the HA1-mBUB1-GLEBS (Fig. 3 B, lane 3; see also lane 1). To determine whether full-length RAE1 and BUB1 interact, we performed several distinct binding studies. First, we synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled HA1-mBUB1 and mRAE1 with a coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system and incubated a mixture of these two proteins with anti-HA1 or control (anti-FLAG) antibody. Analysis of immunoprecipitates after gel electrophoresis revealed that anti-HA1 precipitate contained both HA1-mBUB1 and mRAE1 (Fig. 4 A,lane 1), whereas no labeled proteins were detected in the control precipitate (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). Thus, we conclude that full-length mBUB1 and mRAE1 interact in vitro. We note that the intensity of the mRAE1 band is higher compared with that of HA1-mBUB1. This could be due to a more efficient incorporation of [35S]methionine into mRAE1 than into HA1-mBUB1 (despite the presence of a considerably more methionine residues in HA1-mBUB1 than in mRAE1). Alternatively, it is conceivable that multiple molecules of mRAE1 precipitate per molecule of HA1-mBUB1 because of oligomerization of in vitro translated mRAE1. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that mRAE1 has the capability to form oligomers. Second, we coexpressed HA1-mBUB1 and either FLAG-mRAE1 or FLAG-mBUB3 in HeLa-tTA cells and prepared extracts for immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoblotting showed that both FLAG-mBUB3 and FLAG-mRAE1 efficiently coprecipitated HA1-mBUB1 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and3). Similar coprecipitation results were obtained using extracts derived from HeLa-tTA cells that were arrested in prometaphase with nocodazole 16 h before lysates were prepared (Fig.4 B, lanes 2 and 4). This indicates that a mitotic arrest does not enhance the amount of mBUB1 bound to mBUB3 or mRAE1. To investigate the interaction between endogenous hBUB1 and hRAE1, we immunoprecipitated extracts from HeLa-tTA with affinity-purified BUB1 antibody or a similar amount of preimmune antibody and performed a Western blot analysis using affinity-purified antibodies raised against mRAE1(188–347). As shown in Fig.4 C (lane 2), hRAE1 was present in anti-hBUB1 precipitates but not in precipitates obtained with preimmune antibody (Fig. 4 C, lane 1; n = 3 independent experiments). Although a significant proportion of hRAE1 remained in the supernatant (Fig. 4 C, lane 4), we conclude that a subset of the cellular hRAE1 pool is in a complex with the mitotic checkpoint protein hBUB1. Finally, treatment of HeLa-tTA cells with nocodazole had no impact on the interaction between endogenous hRAE1 and hBUB1 (data not shown). If RAE1 and BUB1 exist as a functional complexin vivo, the two proteins should colocalize to kinetochores of prometaphase chromosomes. To test this prediction, HeLa-tTA cells were cotransfected with FLAG-mRAE1 and HA1-mBUB1, treated with nocodazole, and then triple-stained with antibodies to FLAG, BUB1(1023–1038), and kinetochores. As shown in Fig.5 (A–D andA′–D′), all three antibodies displayed an overlapping punctate staining pattern, revealing that ectopically expressed mRAE1 was present on kinetochores of prometaphase chromosomes not attached to microtubules (15 metaphases were analyzed in detail by confocal microscopy; generally ≥70–90% of the anti-HA1-mRAE1 signals in the confocal images clearly overlapped with an anti-hBUB1/anti-kinetochore signal). Although ectopically expressed mRAE1 clearly bound to kinetochores, a significant proportion of it was found in the mitotic cytosol (Fig. 5, A and D). We also triple-stained the FLAG-mRAE1 and HA1-mBUB1 transfected HeLa-tTA with antibodies to FLAG, mRAE1(188–347), and kinetochores. As expected, the punctate anti-FLAG and anti-kinetochore staining patterns overlapped, but no punctate anti-RAE1 signal was detectable (data not shown). This result indicates that RAE1 epitopes recognized by anti-mRAE1(188–347) antibodies are likely to be masked when RAE1 is bound to kinetochores of metaphase chromosomes. To test whether RAE1 was able to localize to kinetochores of prometaphase chromosomes under near physiological conditions, we generated a NIH-3T3 line with a low-to-moderate overexpressed HA1-mRAE1 (endogenous mRAE1:HA1-mRAE1 ratio of about 1:1; data not shown). When we double-stained these cells with anti-HA1 and anti-kinetochore antibodies, we found clearly overlapping punctate staining patterns (Fig. 5, F–H and F′–H′); 15 prometaphase cells were analyzed in detail; again generally ≥70–90% of the anti-HA1-mRAE1 signals in the confocal images had a matching anti-hBUB1/anti-kinetochore signal). Finally, we produced a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against a synthetic peptide that comprises carboxyl-terminal h/mRAE1 residues 344–361. When we costained 3.5-day-old mouse blastocysts with anti-mRAE1(344–361) and anti-kinetochore antibodies (n = 10 embryos), we were able to detect punctate mRAE1 staining in prometaphase cells that overlapped with kinetochore staining (Fig. 5, J–J′′′ andK–K′′′). Together the above immunolocalization experiments suggest that mRAE1 has the ability to target to kinetochores of prometaphase chromosomes. In this report, we identify the GLEBS motif as a widespread interaction domain. Specifically, we show that GLEBS motifs occur not only in the nucleoporins hNUP98 and scNup116p (7Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A. Hellwig A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) but also in the mitotic checkpoint proteins h/mBUB1 and h/mBUBR1. We demonstrate that the GLEBS motifs of mBUB1 and mBUBR1 are sufficient for binding to BUB3in vitro. In HeLa cells, however, the mBUBR1-GLEBS/BUB3 interaction, but not the mBUB1-GLEBS/BUB3 interaction, requires ectopic expression of BUB3, illustrating that the binding properties of the two GLEBS motifs differ in living cells. Furthermore, we show that the GLEBS of mBUB1 is sufficient for targeting to kinetochores of prometaphase chromosomes; the GLEBS motif of mBUBR1 by itself does not target to kinetochores, although a small amount of mBUBR1-GLEBS can be detected on a subset of kinetochores when FLAG-mBUB3 is coexpressed. Finally, we show that hBUB1, but not BUBR1, can cross-interact with RAE1 through its GLEBS motif. Binding of RAE1 to a nucleoporin and a mitotic checkpoint suggests that this WD repeat protein could be implicated in both nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitosis (as will be discussed below). The GLEBS motifs of scNup116p, hNUP98, h/mBUB1, and h/mBUBR1 contain a highly conserved core region of 16 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). Compared with scNup116p, the identity of this core region is 75% for hNUP98, 69% for h/mBUB1, and 44% for h/mBUBR1. We have shown that RAE1 binds to the GLEBS motif from a mammalian nucleoporin (7Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and a mitotic checkpoint protein, whereas BUB3 strictly binds to GLEBS motifs from mitotic checkpoint proteins. In vitro, mRAE1 seems to interact equally well with GLEBS motifs from mBUB1 and mBUBR1; however,in vivo, its binding is clearly restricted to BUB1. BUB1 has significantly more homology to nucleoporin-derived GLEBS motifs than h/mBUBR1, which may explain why only the mBUB1 motif binds to hRAE1 under physiological conditions. Alternatively, it is conceivable that hRAE1 does have affinity for GLEBS motifs of both mBUB1 and mBUBR1in vivo but that only the GLEBS motif of mBUB1 can compete effectively with endogenous hRAE1-binding proteins for interaction with hRAE1. The mechanism by which individual spindle checkpoint proteins assemble on kinetochores of prometaphase and metaphase chromosomes is complex and only partially understood (35Amon A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 36Burke D.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that BUB3 and MAD2 are checkpoint proteins that dock early to unattached kinetochores of prometaphase chromosomes (14Martinez-Exposito M.J. Kaplan K.B. Copeland J. Sorger P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8493-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 37Chen R.H. Waters J.C. Salmon E.D. Murray A.W. Science. 1996; 274: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 38Li Y. Benezra R. Science. 1996; 274: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It is not clear how BUB3 is directed to kinetochores and whether this requires physical interaction with BUB1 or BUB1-mediated phosphorylation of BUB3. Our finding that BUB1-BUB3 complexes are present in interphase cells favors a model in which BUB3 targets to kinetochores of condensed chromosomes in a BUB1-bound fashion. Because of the remarkable homology between BUB3 and RAE1, the prediction is that the scenario for RAE1 assembly on kinetochores will be very similar to that of BUB3. Like BUB3, RAE1 forms a complex with BUB1 in interphase cells, implying that RAE1 could also bind to unattached kinetochores in a BUB1-bound fashion. No detectable amounts of 32P-labeled hRAE1 were formed when HeLa-tTA cells were grown in the presence of [32P]orthophosphoric acid. 2X. Wang, J. R. Babu, J. M. Harden, S. A. Jablonski, M. H. Gazi, W. L. Lingle, P. C. de Groen, T. J. Yen, and J. M. A. van Deursen, unpublished data. Thus, currently there is no evidence to suggest that phosphorylation of RAE1 would be a prerequisite for its kinetochore localization. Our observation that RAE1 has the ability to target to the GLEBS motifs of both NUP98 and BUB1 is of significant interest, particularly in light of the recent discovery that the soluble nucleocytoplasmic transport Ran transforms into a key regulator of mitosis following disassembly of the nuclear envelope at the beginning of the M phase. Ran, a well characterized transport factor (for reviews see Refs. 39Melchior F. Gerace L.

Ran-GTP is bound to substrate containing export factors because they dock to and translocate through the NPC. At the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, Ran-GTP is converted into Ran-GDP, which triggers disassembly of the trimeric export complex. Substrate-containing import factors dock and translocate through the NPC without Ran. Once at the nuclear face, import complexes associate with Ran-GTP, which triggers the release of substrate from the complex. A series of recent experiments have led to a model for Ran function in mitotic spindle formation. According to this model, a chromatin-associated pool of RCC1 creates high levels of GTP-bound Ran near condensed chromosomes in mitotic cells (42Carazo-Salas R.E. Guarguaglini G. Gruss O.J. Segref A.

This local pool of Ran-GTP interacts with importin α/β heterodimers that bind and inhibit microtubule-organizing components, such as NuMA and TPX2. The binding of Ran-GTP to these complexes then triggers the release of the microtubule-organizing components from the importin α/β complexes, resulting in activation of the microtubule-organizing components and promotion of mitotic spindle assembly (46Gruss O.J. Carazo-Salas R.E. Schatz C.A. Guarguaglini G. Kast J. Wilm M. Le Bot N. Vernos I. Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W.

Our data showing that RAE1 binds to BUB1 through a GLEBS motif suggest that RAE1 could be a novel nucleocytoplasmic transport factor with an alternate role in mitosis. It is possible that upon the sharp decline in mRNA synthesis at the onset of mitosis, RAE1 will simply retire as an export factor and transform into a regulator of mitosis. This hypothesis is supported by experiments in fission yeast (49Whalen W.A. Bharathi A. Danielewicz D. Dhar R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), demonstrating that disruption of spRae1p not only causes defective mRNA export from the nucleus but also a specific arrest in mitosis at a stage prior to the formation of a mitotic spindle. Interestingly, recent experiments have revealed that two mitotic checkpoint proteins, human MAD1 and MAD2, are bound to nuclear basket structures of nuclear pores embedded in the nuclear envelope in interphase (50Campbell M. Chan G. Yen T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 953-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is currently unclear whether NPC-associated MAD1 and MAD2 molecules play an active role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, the fact that these checkpoint proteins have the ability to associate with both kinetochores and nuclear pores supports the notion that the nucleocytoplasmic and mitotic mechanisms contain multiple shared components. Further characterization of RAE1, MAD1, and MAD2 may have the promise of further uncovering the intriguing interplay between the nucleocytoplasmic and mitotic machines.

Accordingly, its expression and function are upregulated in response to diverse stimuli including mitogens and a wide range of stresses. Transcriptional activation of the c-Jun protein is dependent on its phosphorylation at Ser-63 and Ser-73, a process mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Active c-Jun is required for AP-1 transactivation and c-Jun-mediated transformation, but its role during stress remains unclear as both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival effects of c-Jun have been observed. Here we investigated the importance of c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation in influencing the sensitivity of human T98G glioblastoma cells to a variety of cytotoxic agents. Stable expression of a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative protein c-Jun(S63A,S73A) markedly inhibited the activation of AP-1-driven transcription and greatly increased the cytotoxic effects of DNA-damaging agents associated with enhanced apoptosis. However, the same cells expressing the mutant Jun protein did not differ from parental cells in their sensitivity to several non-DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents.

Its transcriptional activities are regulated by changes in the level of c-jun expression as well as posttranslational modifications of the c-Jun protein. In particular, the transactivation potential of c-Jun critically depends on its phosphorylation of amino acid residues Ser-63 and Ser-73 (5Smeal T. Binétruy B. Mercola D. Birrer M. Karin M.

Not surprisingly, both the c-jun expression and phosphorylation of the c-Jun protein are highly induced in response to environmental cues including mitogenic stimuli as well as various stresses (7Whitmarsh A.J.

Although the growth regulatory functions of c-Jun have been firmly established, its role in regulating responses to stress is more controversial. Following stress, both the prolonged c-jun expression and activation of c-Jun have been correlated with apoptotic responses. However, the actual role of c-Jun in influencing cell survival is far from clear. A pro-apoptotic role for c-Jun was suggested in neuronal cells in which the inhibition of c-Jun activity was found to protect cells from nerve growth factor withdrawal (9Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, the overexpression of c-Jun in 3T3 fibroblasts resulted in the induction of apoptosis (10Bossy-Wetzel E. Bakiri L. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Additional studies using strategies to either overexpress or underexpress c-Jun protein or block its phosphorylation have provided evidence that c-Jun is an important mediator of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 11Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) induced by various cytotoxic agents including some chemotherapeutic drugs (12Sanchez-Perez I. Perona R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and alkylating agents (13Kolbus A. Herr I. Schreiber M. Debatin K.M. Wagner E.F. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and UVC (15Shaulian E. Schreiber M. Piu F. Beeche M. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 103: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a growing number of studies employing similar strategies to modulate c-Jun expression and/or activity have suggested that elevated expression and/or activation of c-Jun enhances cell survival during certain conditions of stress (14Huang Y. Hutter D. Liu Y. Wang X. Sheikh M.S. Chan M.-L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In particular, a protective influence of c-Jun against UVC-induced apoptosis was supported by a recent study employing c-jun −/− fibroblasts (19Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The basis for the seemingly disparate roles for c-Jun in regulating cell survival is unclear but could reflect several different factors. One of these is the origin of the cells used, which has ranged from primary embryonic fibroblasts to different tumor cell types. The requirement of c-Jun could differ in normal versustransformed cells, in tumor cells of different cell lineages, or in cells having undergone transformation via different mechanisms. A second factor contributing to the apparent discrepancies noted above is the particular approach used to inhibit the c-Jun function. In some models, c-Jun expression is completely eliminated (i.e.embryonal fibroblasts from c-jun knockout mice), whereas in others only c-Jun phosphorylation and/or activation is prevented (e.g. expression of transactivation-deficient mutant forms of c-Jun protein or perturbation of the signaling pathways leading to c-Jun activation) (13Kolbus A.

Recent studies showing that the expression of a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative c-Jun mutant, c-Jun(S63A,S73A) (5Smeal T. Binétruy B. Mercola D. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 6Binètruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), can partially rescue proliferation defects in c-jun−/− cells (18Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 19Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), suggest that a deficit in phosphorylated c-Jun protein is not equivalent to the absence of c-jun expression (11Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). A third factor likely to be important in determining the influence c-Jun has on cell survival is the particular stress condition investigated. The extent of AP-1 activation can vary greatly from one treatment to another and with different dosages of an agent or durations of exposure. In addition, parallel activation of other stress-responsive signaling pathways and/or genes could influence the relative importance of c-Jun for survival under a given condition. Previous findings using several human tumor cell lines that continuously express high levels of nonphosphorylatable dominant negative c-Jun(S63A,S73A), referred to hereafter as dnJun, suggested a protective role for c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation against cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity (20Potapova O.

In this study, we sought to extend these earlier observations and, therefore, investigated the importance of c-Jun activity in determining the fate of human T98G glioblastoma cells exposed to a variety of DNA-damaging as well as non-DNA-damaging cytostatic and/or cytotoxic compounds. We report that T98G cells expressing dnJun exhibit enhanced sensitivity to DNA-damaging treatments but not to other stressors that act independent of DNA damage to inhibit growth and/or induce cell death. These findings suggest that N-terminal phosphorylation-dependent activation of c-Jun has an important role in protecting human tumor cells against DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Human glioblastoma T98G cells and their dnJun derivatives were described previously (20Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F. Liu C. Birrer M. Gjerset R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 14041-14044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). To assess their sensitivity to various stresses, cells were seeded at a density of 1000 cells/well in 96-well plates, and on the following day, they were treated in the same medium (except in the case of UVC irradiation) with cytotoxic agents for 1 h. After all treatments, cells were washed with PBS and supplemented with fresh complete medium. In the case of UVC treatment, cells were washed with PBS before irradiation, and fresh medium was added immediately after treatment. The measurements of viable cell mass were performed 5–7 days later using a colorimetric-based reaction after the addition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). All determinations were carried out in triplicate, and cell viability was expressed as viable cell mass following a given treatment normalized to that of parallel cultures of untreated cells (Viable Cell Mass, %). The chemicals used were purchased as follows: PlatinolR-AQ cisplatin injection was from Brystol Laboratories; etoposide, thapsigargin, tunicamycin, tamoxifen, MNNG, and taxol (paclitaxel) were from Sigma; MMS was from Aldrich; and doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, streptonigrin, and actinomycin D were from Calbiochem. Transient transfections were carried out using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (22Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). T98G cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well and transfected the following day with 2 µg of total plasmid DNAs/well (0.1 µg of MEKK1, 0.9 µg of expression vectors for either c-Jun of dnJun, and 1 µg of CAT reporter DNA) for 18 h. After washing with PBS containing 0.5 mm EGTA, a fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum was added. 24 h later, the cells were lysed, mixed with CAT reaction mixture (1 mmchloramphenicol, 15 µm HCl, 0.4 µl of carrier-free [3H]acetate, and 0.6 µl of sodium acetate in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were transferred into 1 ml of 7 m Urea, mixed by vigorous shaking with 1 ml of Toluene containing 8 g/liter 2,5-diphenyloxazole (Sigma), and CAT activity was measured by liquid-phase scintillation. All experimental points were carried out in triplicate, and shown are the mean values of four such experiments. Cells were treated with various agents, and lysates were prepared 30 min later in whole cell extract buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.3 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm α-glycerophosphate, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm freshly added dithiothreitol). The JNK kinase assay was performed as described before (23Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) using sc-571 JNK antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for precipitation and rat recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun(1–79) protein (Biomol Research Laboratories) as substrate. The samples were resolved by electrophoresis through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and phosphorylated [γ-32P]glutathioneS-transferase-cJun was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). DNA synthesis rates were measured using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (1000 cells/well) and treated with cisplatin for 1 h as described above. At designated times after the treatment, [3H]thymidine (0.5 mCi/well) was added for 3 h. Cells were harvested with a PhD-200A cell harvester (Cambridge Technologies), which transferred the labeled lysates onto paper disks. These disks were subsequently washed, and the amount of radioactive DNA was quantitated by scintillation counting using Biosafe-II scintillation liquid. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, washed again in PBS, incubated with RNase, and stained with propidium iodide using a cellular DNA flow cytometry analysis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Data were acquired with 1024 channels of resolution on fluorescence-activated cell sorter scan, FACScan (Becton Dickinson), and percentages of cells in the various cell cycle stages were determined using Multicycle software (Phoenix). To investigate the importance of c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation in determining the sensitivity of human tumor cells to various stresses, T98G cells that overexpress a nonphosphorylatable dominant negative mutant c-Jun(S63A,S73A) protein, dnJun, were generated (20Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F. Liu C. Birrer M. Gjerset R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 14041-14044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The levels of c-Jun protein in two such dnJun cell lines (clones 10-6 and 10-10) as well as parental T98G cells transfected with empty vector (T98GX) are shown in Fig.1A. The T98GdnJun clones showed ∼5–6-fold higher amounts of total c-Jun protein (endogenous c-Jun and dnJun proteins combined) relative to T98GX cells, indicating a high level of dnJun expression. The expression of the dnJun in T98G cells was associated with growth inhibition in clonal cell lines characterized by slower rates of proliferation and reduced saturation densities (Fig. 1 B). The effect of dnJun on cell growth could result from at least two different mechanisms. Nonphosphorylatable dnJun could act as a dominant negative inhibitor of AP-1 transcriptional activity as has been suggested previously (5Smeal T. Binétruy B. Mercola D. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 6Binètruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Alternatively, given that JNK is proposed to bind tightly to c-Jun and release it only after phosphorylation (24Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Moore G. Davis R.J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), dnJun could block JNK activity directly by acting as a pseudo-substrate and tying up the JNK protein. To explore the first possibility, the AP-1 transcriptional activity of T98G cells expressing dnJun was examined using transiently transfected CAT-based reporter constructs linked to various AP-1 binding elements with which c-Jun has been shown to interact (25van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 26Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway was then specifically stimulated by the expression of a constitutively active mutant form of the upstream kinase, MEKK1 (27Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This resulted in a strong activation of AP-1 (6xAP-1 and 3xTRE) and ATF/cAMP-response element-binding protein (5xjun2) binding site reporter constructs (Fig. 1 C,open bars) without affecting CAT expression driven by a control promoter 56FosΔE, which lacks a functional AP-1 site (22Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). The transient expression of dnJun (solid bars) but not wild type c-Jun (hatched bars) lead to a substantial inhibition (>80% decrease) of all three AP-1 reporter constructs used in these experiments (Fig. 1 C). Thus, consistent with observations in 3T3 fibroblasts (5Smeal T. Binétruy B. Mercola D. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 6Binètruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 18Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), MEKK1-mediated transcriptional transactivation of AP-1 in human T98G glioblastoma cells was dependent on the availability of active c-Jun. To determine whether dnJun interfered directly with JNK activity, JNK activity was measured using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay with c-Jun(1–79) as a substrate in T98GX and T98GdnJun cultures 30 min after treatment with either 40 J/m2 UVC or 200 µm cisplatin. The expression of dnJun did not affect the level of JNK activity following UVC (Fig. 1 D,bottom panel) or cisplatin (data not shown) treatments, suggesting that permanent association of JNK and dnJun molecules did not occur. These results argue against a direct effect of dnJun on the JNK enzyme and indicate that the expression of dnJun in T98G cells inhibits c-Jun-phosphorylation-dependent AP-1 transactivation consistent with a dominant negative mechanism. An assessment of long term (5–7 days) growth effects in cells subjected to 1-h exposure to different cytotoxic compounds was performed using an MTS tetrazolium dye conversion assay measuring viable cell mass (Promega). A reduction in viable cell mass can occur as a result of growth inhibition or cell death. A variety of agents known to act via different mechanisms to damage DNA were tested (TableI). As shown in Fig.2, cells harboring dnJun were more sensitive than their normal counterparts to the growth inhibitory effects of all of the DNA-damaging agents tested regardless of the compound's mode of action. Parental and dnJun-expressing T98G cells were also examined for their sensitivity to several other agents known to exert growth inhibitory or toxic effects on cells unrelated to DNA damage. These included the microtubule-disrupting agent taxol, the anti-estrogen agent tamoxifen, and two agents known to cause stress to the endoplasmic reticulum, thapsigargin, and tunicamycin (Table I). As seen in Fig. 3, no differences in sensitivity to any of these agents were seen when comparing the results for T98GX and T98GdnJun cells.Table IDescription of treatmentsCytotoxic agentDNA damageStress description (types of DNA damage and other effects)CisplatinYesIntroduces interstrand/intrastrand DNA cross-links and DNA-protein cross-links.

All assays were carried out as described in the legend for Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ER, endoplasmic reticulum. A number of different mechanisms, such as (i) impaired DNA synthesis, (ii) perturbations in cell cycle progression, and (iii) induction of apoptosis could contribute to the reduction in viable cell mass seen following treatment with cytotoxic agents. c-Jun activity could influence such effects, thereby accounting for the differential sensitivity of T98GX and T9GdnJun cells (Figs. 2 and 3). To characterize the contribution of various mechanisms to the enhanced loss of cell mass in T98GdnJun cultures after DNA-damaging treatments, we explored the effects of a well characterized chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin on growth properties of T98GX versus T98GdnJun cells. First, DNA synthesis was examined in T98G and T98GdnJun cultures treated with various doses of cisplatin and transplatin. Although the treatment of cells with transplatin, a platinum compound that does not induce DNA-damage responses, had no significant effect on DNA synthesis (data not shown), DNA synthesis was markedly inhibited in cisplatin-treated T98GX and T98GdnJun cells. This inhibition was dose-dependent and transient as determined by tritiated thymidine incorporation at various time points (24–96 h) (data for 24 h are shown in Fig.4A). However, when normalized to the cell number, the degree of inhibition as well as the rates of recovery was similar in parental and dnJun-expressing cells (Fig.4 B), indicating that greater inhibition of DNA synthesis is not the cause for the enhanced growth inhibitory effects of DNA-damaging agents in T98GdnJun cells. Morphological examination of cisplatin-treated T98GdnJun cells by phase-contrast microscopy revealed features such as cell rounding and membrane blebbing, suggestive of apoptosis (Fig.5). Further examination of the cells by DAPI staining revealed clear evidence of condensed and fragmented nuclei. These morphological features were much less apparent in T98GX cells treated with cisplatin and were absent in thapsigargin-treated cells regardless of c-Jun status (Fig. 5), suggesting that the degree of apoptosis seen in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents can depend on c-Jun status. Therefore, we examined the cell cycle distribution of untreated and cisplatin-treated T98GX and T98GdnJun cells. Similar cell cycle profiles were seen for the T98GX and T98GdnJun cells under normal growth conditions (results for clone T98GdnJun 10-10 clone are shown in Fig. 6A), although a small but significant (p < 0.02, Student's t test) difference in the proportion of cells in the G1 and S phases was noted (Fig. 6 B). The greater proportion of T98GdnJun cells in G1 with a reduced number in the S phase compartment could reflect the slower growth rate of the T98GdnJun cells. Cisplatin treatment resulted in an increased accumulation of cells in the S phase and a loss of cells in the G2 compartment in both T98GdnJun and T98GX cultures. However, consistent with the morphological analysis described above, cisplatin treatment of dnJun-expressing cells resulted in the appearance of a significant sub-G1 compartment that was much less apparent in T98GX cells (Fig. 6 C, upper panel). A similar effect was noted after etoposide treatment (data not shown). Treatment of T98GX and T98GdnJun cells with thapsigargin resulted in a very different profile from that seen with cisplatin. Both parental T98GX and dnJun-expressing T98GdnJun cells became arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle without accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 region (Fig. 6 C, lower panel).Figure 6Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis of T98G and T98GdnJun cells. A, cell cycle analysis in normal growing cultures. T98GX and T98GdnJun cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2, maintained under normal growth conditions (10% fetal calf serum (FCS)), and prepared for flow cytometric analysis 48 h after being seeded. Data were acquired with 1024 channels of resolution on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter scan (channels 0–450 are shown) and analyzed with Multicycle software. B, distribution of cells among various cell cycle compartments was assessed by Multicycle software. Shown are mean values obtained from four independent experiments (data obtained with T98GdnJun 10-6 and 10-10 clones were pooled for the analysis). A statistically significant difference in the number of cells in S phase was detected between T98GdnJun and T98G cultures (*, p < 0.02, Student's t test).C, flow cytometric analysis of cisplatin- and thapsigargin-treated T98GX and T98GdnJun cells. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 and treated the next day with either cisplatin (upper panel) or thapsigargin (lower panel) for 24 h. Propidium iodide staining was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, biochemical assessment of apoptosis following DNA damage. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2, and treated the following day for 1 h with either 100 µm cisplatin, 1 µg/ml doxorubicin, or 50 µg/ml etoposide. Apoptosis was assessed 24 h later using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay that measures levels of degraded nuclear DNA in the cytoplasm. The assay was performed as specified by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and each treatment point was assayed in triplicate. The results are expressed as the percentage of values seen in untreated parallel cultures of the same origin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Additional confirmation of the differential extent of apoptosis in T98GX and T98GdnJun cells after treatment with DNA-damaging agents was obtained using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay that detects the presence of histone-associated DNA fragments in the cytoplasm. As shown in Fig. 6 D for the T98GdnJun 10-10 clone, all three of the DNA-damaging agents tested caused greater amounts of apoptosis in T98GdnJun cells relative to T98GX, whereas no differences in the levels of apoptotic signals were detected in T98GX and T98GdnJun cultures treated with taxol, thapsigargin, or tunicamycin (data not shown). In summary, both long term viability and short term apoptosis assays indicated that the overexpression of phosphorylation-deficient dnJun protein renders human T98G glioblastoma cells significantly more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents relative to their normal counterparts. These results support an important role for c-Jun in the cellular protection against such insults. Significant controversy exists in the published literature regarding the role of c-Jun in regulating cell survival during the stress response. Often, the mere correlation between enhanced expression of c-Jun and the onset of apoptosis has led authors to conclude that c-Jun is directly involved in mediating cell death, but in such instances c-Jun expression and or activation could in fact occur as part of a failed defense response aimed at cell protection. More mechanistic studies in which either c-Jun expression or functional activity has been manipulated through gene targeting or mutagenesis strategies have also produced disparate findings. Such discrepancies could reflect the nature of the manipulations employed, the cell types studied, or the particular stress conditions evaluated. For example, both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic roles of c-Jun have been reported using c-jun−/− fibroblasts derived from knockout mice when different conditions were applied (13Kolbus A. Herr I. Schreiber M. Debatin K.M. Wagner E.F. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Shaulian E. Schreiber M. Piu F. Beeche M. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 103: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Whether pro-survival or pro-apoptotic, it is clear that a better understanding of the role c-Jun plays in determining cell survival under the conditions of stress could lead to improved strategies for the treatment of human cancers. Here we investigated the role of activated c-Jun in influencing the viability of human tumor cells subjected to various cytotoxic stresses. The model employed consisted of T98G glioblastoma cells engineered to express high levels of a c-Jun(S63A,S73A) protein in which serine residues, known to be critical for the phosphorylation-dependent transactivation of c-Jun-containing AP-1 complexes, were mutated to alanines (5Smeal T. Binétruy B. Mercola D. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 6Binètruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations with a transactivation-deficient mutant form of c-Jun, TAM67 (28Brown P.H. Kim S.H. Wise S.C. Sabichi A.L. Birrer M.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1013-1021PubMed Google Scholar) replacement of endogenous c-Jun from AP-1 complexes by overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable dnJun protein led to a successful inhibition of AP-1 transactivation (Fig.1 C). It is interesting to note that the overexpression of phosphorylation-deficient dnJun had no inhibitory effect on JNK activation under the conditions of genotoxic stress (Fig.1 D), suggesting that the effects described in this study were solely attributed to the inhibition of phosphorylation-dependent c-Jun-mediated functions, whereas other targets of JNK signaling in stressed cells remained unaffected. Examining the responsiveness of normal and dnJun-expressing T98G cells (T98GX and T98GdnJun, respectively) to different cytotoxic agents, we observed no differences in their sensitivities to any of the four compounds known to act independent of DNA damage to exert the cytotoxic effects (Fig. 3). This result is consistent with the previous observation that the activation of the MEKK1 pathway has no role in the induction of apoptosis by microtubule-altering drugs (16Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, T98GdnJun cells displayed much greater sensitivity to all of 12 different DNA-damaging agents tested (Fig. 2, data not shown). Interestingly, this effect was seen regardless of the particular mode of agent action, i.e. agents capable of causing single and double strand DNA breaks such as UVC (Fig. 2 B) and γ-irradiation (data not shown), agents creating DNA adducts (cisplatin), alkylating agents (MMS and MNNG), topoisomerase inhibitors (etoposide), and agents that cause extensive oxidative damage (streptonigrin) (summarized in Table I). This finding suggests that c-Jun or some other AP-1 component whose activity is subject to interference by the presence of the mutant c-Jun protein provides a general protective function during the response to DNA damage. These findings appear to contradict the more widely held view of c-Jun as a mediator of apoptosis (10Bossy-Wetzel E. Bakiri L. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 11Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 12Sanchez-Perez I. Perona R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, like our studies, several previous studies have suggested a protective function for c-Jun after DNA damage. These include reports demonstrating that abrogation of c-Jun induction renders cells more sensitive to DNA damage (21Hayakawa J. Ohmichi M. Kurachi H. Ikegami H. Kimura A. Matsuoka T. Jikihara H. Mercola D. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31648-31654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 29Fritz G. Kaina B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and that elevated c-Jun expression render cells more resistant to doxorubicin-induced cell death (30Pourquier P. Montaudon D. Huet S. Larrue A. Clary A. Robert J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One possible way in which c-Jun could influence cell survival during the response to DNA damage is through affecting DNA repair capacity. Indeed, in a previous study (20Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F. Liu C. Birrer M. Gjerset R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 14041-14044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we provided evidence suggesting that inhibition of the JNK pathway affects the ability of T98G cells to repair cisplatin-generated DNA adducts (20Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F. Liu C. Birrer M. Gjerset R. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 14041-14044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In association with this study, we examined the efficiency of DNA repair after treatment with 50–100 µg/ml etoposide in T98GX and T98GdnJun cells using a Comet assay (31Olive P.L. Banath J.P. Durand R.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This single cell DNA repair assay allows an assessment of DNA repair of double strand DNA breaks. Whereas one of the two T98GdnJun cell clones (clone 10-6) employed in the current studies exhibited reduced repair of etoposide-induced double strand DNA breaks compared with control cultures 2 h after the treatment, the other T98GdnJun cell line did not (data not shown). Thus, it appears improbable that differential repair capacity is the explanation for the enhanced sensitivity of T98GdnJun cells to DNA-damaging treatments. However, it is worth noting that although double strand DNA breaks are the prevailing form, it is not the only type of DNA damage caused by etoposide, and it is conceivable that other repair activities could also influence the response. Human cells have multiple systems responsible for repair of various types of DNA damage, and obviously more detailed investigations will be necessary to determine what relationship, if any, exists between c-Jun and DNA repair in influencing sensitivity of dnJun-expressing T98G cells to DNA-damaging agents. As reported here, T98GdnJun cells exhibit greater apoptotic changes after treatment with DNA-damaging treatments than do their wild type counterparts. Evidence of enhanced apoptosis in T98GdnJun cells after treatment with the DNA-damaging agents included (i) general morphological appearance and detachment of cells from the tissue culture plates (Fig. 5, data not shown), (ii) higher levels of fragmented DNA as assessed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay (Fig. 6 D), (iii) higher numbers of fragmented nuclei as visualized by DAPI staining (Fig. 5), and (iv) a greater proportion of cells in the sub-G1 compartment as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig. 6 C). No such differences were noted in cultures treated with non-DNA-damaging agents. For example, treatment with thapsigargin resulted in a marked G1 arrest in both T98GX and T98GdnJun cells (Fig. 6 C). Such G1 arrest has been implicated as an important factor in the survival of thapsigargin-treated cells (32Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. Sherr C.J. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8505-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Treatments with taxol and tamoxifen, on the other hand, resulted in significant apoptosis, but levels were indistinguishable comparing T98G and T98GdnJun cells (data not shown). Thus, the presence of active c-Jun and, therefore, the availability of active c-Jun-containing AP-1 complexes appear to have a selective role in protecting cells from apoptosis induced by DNA damage. The effects observed in this study suggest that activated AP-1 complexes exert a favorable influence on cell survival following sensitivity to DNA damage. If so, then like the expression of nonactivatable c-Jun, the inhibition of upstream regulators of c-Jun activation should result in the sensitization of T98G cells to DNA-damaging agents. Presently, no specific chemical inhibitors of c-Jun or JNK are available, but we have shown that the expression and activation of JNK can be inhibited efficiently through the use of specific JNK antisense oligonucleotides (33Bost F. McKay R. Dean N.M. Potapova O. Mercola D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 314: 342-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we have found that as seen for T98GdnJun-expressing cells, the pretreatment of T98G cells with JNK antisense oligonucleotides enhances their susceptibility to cisplatin treatment (data not shown). In summary, our findings suggest that activated c-Jun serves a selective function in protecting human tumor cells against cytotoxic effects of DNA-damaging agents. The heightened sensitivity of cells lacking phosphorylation-dependent c-Jun functions could be exploited in the development of therapeutic regimens for the treatment of human cancers where the combined use of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents with inhibitors of c-Jun activation could have clinical benefits.

A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using the PDZ domain of γ1- syntrophin, a recently identified brain-specific isoform, yielded overlapping clones encoding the C terminus of diacylglycerol kinase-ζ (DGK-ζ), an enzyme that converts diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid. In biochemical assays, the C terminus of DGK-ζ, which contains a consensus PDZ-binding motif, was found to be necessary and sufficient for association with γ1-syntrophin. When coexpressed in HeLa cells, DGK-ζ and γ1-syntrophin formed a stable complex that partitioned between the cytoplasm and nucleus. DGK-ζ translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus, a process negatively regulated by protein kinase C phosphorylation. We found that DGK-ζ recruits γ1-syntrophin into the nucleus and that the PDZ-binding motif is required. Disrupting the interaction altered the intracellular localization of both proteins; DGK-ζ accumulated in the nucleus, whereas γ1-syntrophin remained in the cytoplasm. The level of endogenous syntrophins in the nucleus of HeLa cells also reflected the amount of nuclear DGK-ζ. In the brain, DGK-ζ and γ1-syntrophin were colocalized in cell bodies and dendrites of cerebellar Purkinjie neurons and other neuronal cell types, suggesting that their interaction is physiologically relevant. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments from brain extracts and cells suggest that DGK-ζ, γ1-syntrophin, and dystrophin form a ternary complex.

An efficient response usually requires the precise localization of receptors, ion channels, and signal transduction proteins and the coordinated coupling of these proteins into functional signaling pathways. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the clustering and anchoring of these proteins at specific subcellular sites is mediated by scaffold proteins that interact with the cytoskeleton (1Lee S.H. Sheng M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Proteins containing PDZ (postsynaptic density protein-95/discs large/zona occludens-1) domains have emerged as key players in the targeting of membrane proteins and the spatial control of intracellular signaling. The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC)1 is a group of membrane and cytoplasmic proteins that interacts with dystrophin, the product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene (2Blake D.J. Kroger S. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 92-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, the DAPC forms a link between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton and is thought to have a role in stabilizing the membrane against the forces of contraction (3Petrof B.J. Shrager J.B. Stedman H.H. Kelly A.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The absence of dystrophin and the concomitant loss of the DAPC from the sarcolemma in Duchenne muscular dystrophy disrupt the cytoskeletal-extracellular matrix link and ultimately lead to the progressive degeneration of muscle fibers (4Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests the DAPC also organizes functional signaling complexes at the cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interface (2Blake D.J. Kroger S. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 92-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Syntrophins are a family of cytoplasmic peripheral membrane proteins that link ion channels and signaling proteins to the DAPC via a direct interaction with the C terminus of dystrophin family proteins (5Froehner S.C. Adams M.E. Peters M.F. Gee S.H. Soc. Gen. Physiologists Ser. 1997; 52: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar). The five known isoforms share a common domain organization, consisting of two tandem pleckstrin homology domains at the N terminus, a highly conserved C-terminal domain that is unique to syntrophins (SU), and a single PDZ domain (6Adams M.E. Dwyer T.M. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25859-25865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Ahn A.H. Freener C.A. Gussoni E. Yoshida M.

Syntrophin PDZ domains (α1, β1, and β2), interact with the C-terminal sequence motif (consensus E(S/T)XV) found in skeletal muscle Na+ channels (8Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H.

In addition, α- and β-syntrophins bind to neuronal nitric-oxide synthase and microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinases through PDZ-PDZ/β-finger interactions (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H.

Each syntrophin has a unique tissue and developmental expression pattern and selectively pairs with different dystrophin family proteinsin vivo, suggesting that complexes containing different isoforms serve distinct functional roles (7Ahn A.H.

For example, α1-syntrophin is necessary for the membrane association of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase and for the proper targeting of utrophin, a dystrophin homologue, to the postsynaptic membrane of skeletal muscle (19Adams M.E.

In addition, although more than one syntrophin isoform can be expressed in a single cell type, their subcellular distributions can differ dramatically, implying that their localization is tightly regulated. For instance, in skeletal muscle, α1-syntrophin is distributed over the entire sarcolemma and is present throughout the folds at neuromuscular junctions, whereas β2-syntrophin is found almost exclusively at junctions and is confined to the lower portion of the folds (20Peters M.F. Kramarcy N.R. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Kramarcy N.R. Sealock R. Mol.

By Northern analysis, γ1-syntrophin is expressed uniquely in the brain, whereas γ2-syntrophin has a somewhat broader distribution. In situhybridization and immunohistochemical studies have shown that γ1-syntrophin is expressed exclusively in neurons, and although γ1-syntrophin binds to the C terminus of dystrophin family members like other syntrophins (22Piluso G. Mirabella M. Ricci E. Belsito A. Abbondanza C. Servidei S. Puca A.A. Tonali P. Puca G.A. Nigro V. J. Biol.

Quenneville S. Lombardo C.R. Chabot J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14638-14646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify brain proteins that interact with the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin. We found that the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase-ζ (DGK-ζ) interacts with γ1-syntrophin via a PDZ-binding motif at its C terminus. DGK-ζ is one of several known DGK isoforms, all of which convert diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid and are believed to attenuate the activity of proteins activated by DAG, such as protein kinase C (PKC). Collectively, our results suggest that γ1-syntrophin may participate in regulating the subcellular localization of DGK-ζ to ensure that DAG is rapidly inactivated following receptor activation. Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using the EGY48 yeast strain harboring the reporter genes β-galactosidase on the plasmid EGY48 and Leu2 on the plasmid pSH18-34. These reporter genes are under the control of six and eight upstream LexA operators, respectively (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The PDZ domain bait consisted of amino acids 51–149 of human γ1-syntrophin fused in frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain in vector pHybLex/Zeo (Invitrogen Corp.). A human brain cDNA library constructed in the activation domain vector pB42AD (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with the PDZ domain bait. Several small scale yeast transformations were performed where 2.5 × 10 8 cells containing the bait plasmid were transferred to 50 ml of YPD medium and subsequently incubated until the density reached 2 × 107 cells/ml, after which the liquid yeast culture was transformed with 5 µg of cDNA library and 0.5 mg of salmon sperm carrier DNA using the lithium acetate method with 50% polyethylene glycol (w/v). After transformation, the yeast were grown 1–2 h in selective ura− trp− medium to allow expression of the Leu2 reporter gene, before adding Zeocin (Invitrogen) at 200 µg/ml. The cultures were grown overnight and then plated on ura− trp−leu− plates containing 25 µg/ml Zeocin, 2% galactose, and 1% raffinose. DNA was isolated from positive yeast colonies and transformed into the KC8 bacterial strain by electroporation. Positives were isolated from the bacteria and retransformed into yeast with either the bait or a negative control (pHybLex/Zeo + Lamin) and plated on selective 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates. Positives were sequenced at the University of Ottawa Biotechnology Research Institute. To identify subsequent DGK-ζ clones, the primers 5′-CAGTCAGCACTGGCAGCAAG and 5′-TAGTGCTGCCGGTTCTCCAG were used to amplify DNA directly from positive yeast colonies. Positive colonies were identified by the presence of a 259-base pair polymerase chain reaction product. Antigenic peptides 342 (CKILKDSDLLDRRK) and 435 (CKFSQLKGSSDDGKSK) were chosen from the deduced amino acid sequence of human γ1-syntrophin by the method of Hopp and Woods (24Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). The peptide designation refers to the number of the first amino acid in the sequence. Peptides were synthesized by the University of Waterloo Peptide Synthesis Facility (Waterloo, ON) and contained an additional cysteine residue (underlined) at the N terminus. The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via their N-terminal cysteine residues usingm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce) according to the method described by Harlow and Lane (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 314-315Google Scholar). The resultant peptide conjugates were injected into rabbits. The antisera were prepared by Covance, Inc. (Denver, PA) and were affinity purified on immobilized immunogenic peptides as described (8Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were coupled to Ultralink Iodoacetyl (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The T7 tag monoclonal antibody was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Monoclonal anti-dystrophin, clone MANDRA-1 was purchased from Sigma. Texas Red-, Cy3-, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma (9E10), the polyclonal anti-HA antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc., (San Francisco, CA), and monoclonal antibody (B 14) to GST was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). To produce polyclonal antibodies to the N terminus of DGK-ζ, a peptide (CGSERDAGPEPDKAPRRLNK) corresponding to human DGK-ζ was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into rabbits. The antibodies were affinity purified from serum on immobilized peptide. The specificity of the antibodies was verified by Western blotting extracts from cells transfected with DGK-ζ and by preabsorption of antibodies with the immunizing peptide. A cDNA clone (4B1) encoding full-length γ1-syntrophin in the plasmid vector pFHR was a generous gift from Drs. Gerry Cox and Lou Kunkel (7Ahn A.H. Freener C.A. Gussoni E. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2724-2730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To construct an N-terminal GFP-γ1-syntrophin fusion, the γ1-syntrophin coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from clone 4B1 and cloned in frame into ApaI and HindIII restriction sites of pQBI25-fC1 (Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada) and sequenced. To construct T7-tagged γ1-syntrophin, the cassette encoding GFP was cut out using ApaI and NheI restriction sites, and a duplex oligonucleotide encoding the T7 tag was inserted into the same sites. The PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin was amplified using forward (5′-ATATGAATTCTTCTATTCTGGTGAAAGAACGGTG) and reverse (5′-ATATCTCGAGTGGGAGTTTGAGGAAAGCAGGTG) primers containing EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined), respectively, and was cloned into the same sites in pET-32a (Novagen). The γ1-syntrophin PDZ domain was subcloned from pET-32a into pHybLex/Zeo and pGEX-5X1 using theEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. Constructs encoding the PDZ domains of α- and β-syntrophins have been described previously (8Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J.

Adult C57BL6 mice were sacrificed by CO2 overdose, and their brains were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C until needed. To prepare crude subcellular fractions, 1–2 g of mouse brain were added to 10 volumes of TEE buffer + protease inhibitor mixture (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCI, pepstatin A, and benzamidine HCl). The mixture was homogenized in a small sample cup of a Waring blender and centrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 10 min. An aliquot of the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed, added to 5× concentrated SDS sample buffer, and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of TEE buffer + protease inhibitors, homogenized as before, and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of TEE buffer containing 0.1 mNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, extracted on an Adams Nutator for 30 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant (membrane fraction) was removed and added to 5× reducing sample buffer as above. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the adult skeletal muscle Na+ channel SkM1 (VRPGVKESLV), the embryonic skeletal muscle Na+ channel SkM2 (SPDRDRESIV), and the Shaker-type K+ channels Kv1.4 (SNAKAVETDV) and Kv1.5 (CLDTSRETDL) were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO). The DGK-ζ C-terminal peptide (IQREDQETAV) was synthesized by the University of Waterloo Peptide Synthesis Facility (Waterloo, ON). All peptides contained an additional 4-amino acid linker (SGSG) at the N terminus and an N-terminal biotin. Overlay assays were carried out as described previously (8Gee S.H. Madhavan R.

Signals generated by enhanced chemiluminescence were captured with a Digital Image Station (Kodak). The amount of fusion protein loaded in each lane was compared by digitally capturing an image of the Ponceau S-stained blot prior to blocking. Fusion proteins were purified as described previously (8Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. BL21(λDE3)pLysS cells were transformed and grown in 2 ml of LB medium supplemented with 200 µg/ml ampicillin and 34 µg/ml chloramphenicol (LB-Amp-Chlor) overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh LB-Amp-Chlor. This was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB-Amp-Chlor, which was grown until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6–1.0. Protein expression was then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (BioShop, Canada, Inc., Burlington, Canada), and the culture was incubated overnight at 28 °C. All subsequent steps were as described. C57BL6 mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with normal saline, followed by perfusion with a solution of 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 15% picric acid, 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The brains were immediately removed from the cranium, post-fixed for 90 min at 4 °C in the same buffer, then transferred to PBS, pH 7.2, 10% sucrose, and then stored overnight at 4 °C. The brains were flash frozen with powdered dry ice, and saggital sections were cut on a cryostat at a thickness of 10 µm at −20 °C. The sections were stored at −80 °C prior to use. The sections were thawed, ringed with a hydrophobic boundary and rinsed with PBS. The sections were then incubated with affinity-purified antibody diluted in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% normal goat serum in a closed moisture chamber overnight at 4 °C. The sections were subsequently rinsed in PBS for 15 min and then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of FITC- or Texas Red dye-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100. The sections were then rinsed in PBS for 15 min and coverslipped with Fluoromount G (EMS, Fort Washington, PA). A Zeiss Axioskop microscope was used to visualize the sections, and images were captured using a Sony CCD camera and Northern Eclipse software. The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Cells for immunoprecipitation were used 18–24 h post-transfection. All steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. Cells were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCI, pepstatin A, and benzamidine HCl)/100-mm dish. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min then scraped from the dish and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and an aliquot of this starting material (Input) was boiled in SDS sample buffer. One to five µg of antibody was added to ∼0.5 ml of supernatant and incubated at 4 °C with mixing for 1–2 h. To purify immune complexes, 50 µl of a 50% slurry of washed protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 20 µl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added and incubated an additional 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, and an aliquot of the supernatant was removed and boiled in SDS sample buffer (unbound fraction). The complexes were washed three times for 5 min each with lysis buffer and then eluted by boiling in 50 µl of SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. For transfections, cells were 40–80% confluent. The cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as follows. A solution containing 256 mmCaCl2 and 10–30 µg of DNA in sterile water was added dropwise to an equal volume of 2× Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.05, over a 30–60 s period with constant vortexing. The final volume of this transfection solution was 250 µl for 35-mm dishes and 1 ml for 100-mm dishes. The Ca2+-DNA complexes were allowed to precipitate for 30 min at room temperature. The solution was vortexed and added dropwise onto cells, and the dish was swirled gently to mix. The cells were grown at for 8–16 h at 37 °C and then washed two or three times with nonsupplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or sterile PBS. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library, using the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin as bait, yielded 10 independent overlapping cDNA clones encoding DGK-ζ. The structure of DGK-ζ is shown schematically in Fig.1. All of the cDNAs isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screen (four were completely sequenced and are shown here) overlapped in the C-terminal region of DGK-ζ, suggesting that this region mediates the binding to the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence (-ETAV) at the C terminus of DGK-ζ is consistent with the class I PDZ domain ligand consensus ((S/T)XV) (29Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) and with the consensus sequence identified for strong binding to α- and β-syntrophin PDZ domains ((Q/R/K)E(S/T)X(V/L/I)) (8Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14638-14646Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C-terminal sequence is conserved in human, mouse, and rat DGK-ζ (30Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The controls for the specificity of the yeast two-hybrid interaction included retesting positive clones by back transformation into yeast and lack of interaction with a nuclear lamin prey. In addition, γ1-syntrophin PDZ did not self-activate when transformed into yeast with an empty prey vector. To show direct biochemical association between the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin and the C terminus of DGK-ζ, overlay filter binding assays were performed. A soluble GST fusion protein containing the C terminus of DGK-ζ (clone 8) bound to a His6 fusion protein of the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin but not to any of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, DGK-ζ appeared to bind more strongly to PDZ domains of α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophins. Thus, these in vitro binding data indicate that DGK-ζ interacts preferentially with PDZ domains from the syntrophin family of proteins. We next tested whether this interaction occurs within the context of the full-length γ1-syntrophin protein expressed in mammalian cells. A GST fusion protein containing the C terminus of DGK-ζ efficiently “pulled down” T7-tagged full-length γ1-syntrophin from lysates of transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B), whereas GST alone did not. To determine whether the C terminus of DGK-ζ is sufficient for interaction with the PDZ domain of γ1-syntrophin, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of DGK-ζ was assayed for binding to His6 fusion proteins of various PDZ domains in overlay assays. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the DGK-ζ C terminus bound to all four syntrophin PDZ domains but not to PDZ domains of PSD-95, confirming the results obtained with the GST-DGK-ζ fusion protein. Thus, the C terminus of DGK-ζ is sufficient for binding to γ1-PDZ. As a further test of the specificity of the interaction between DGK-ζ and γ1-syntrophin, we tested other C-terminal peptide ligands for their ability to bind the γ1-syntrophin PDZ domain. As shown previously, the C terminus of two skeletal muscle sodium channels, SkM1 and SkM2 bound strongly to PDZ domains of α- and β-syntrophins (8Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,9Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but did not bind to γ1-PDZ (Fig. 2 D). Likewise, the C terminus of the K+ channel Kv1.5 bound strongly to α1-, β1-, and β2-PDZs but did not bind γ1-PDZ. Of the peptides we tested, only Kv1.4 bound to γ1-PDZ in addition to other syntrophin PDZs. Examination of the C-terminal sequence of Kv1.4 (VETDV) revealed that it is the most similar to that of DGK-ζ (QETAV). These results demonstrate that the interaction of the γ1-syntrophin PDZ domain with the C terminus of DGK-ζ is sequence-"

In an effort to understand substrate determinants of this repair system, we tested DNAs with minor backbone modifications using the ultrasensitive excision assay. We found that a phosphorothioate and a methylphosphonate were excised with low efficiency. Surprisingly, we also found that fragments of 23–28 nucleotides and of 12–13 nucleotides characteristic of human and Escherichia coliexcision repair, respectively, were removed from undamaged DNA at a significant rate. Considering the relative abundance of undamaged DNA in comparison to damaged DNA in the course of the life of an organism, we conclude that, in general, excision from and resynthesis of undamaged DNA may exceed the excision and resynthesis caused by DNA damage. As resynthesis is invariably associated with mutations, we propose that gratuitous repair may be an important source of spontaneous mutations.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 2Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It is the major repair system for bulky base adducts, but it also acts on nonbulky lesions such as oxidized or methylated bases and, as such, functions as a backup system for DNA glycosylases, which have restricted substrate ranges (3Huang J.C.

Both of these questions have been addressed in numerous studies, and at present we have a basic understanding of damage recognition in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 2Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 5Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6090-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). With regard to substrate range, its limits remain to be defined. The excision nuclease, which originally was thought to be specific for bulky lesions, was later found to excise nonbulky adducts such as methylated bases but, apparently, failed to excise nucleotides with backbone modifications such as the C4′ pivaloyl adduct (5Hess M.T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) we decided to re-examine the question of recognition of backbone modifications. We found that both phosphorothioate and methylphosphonate backbone modifications were recognized as substrates by the human excision nuclease. This, in turn, led us to take a closer look at the effect of the enzyme system on undamaged DNA. We find that both the human and the Escherichia coli excision nucleases excise oligomers of 23–28 and 12–13 nucleotides, respectively, from undamaged DNA. This gratuitous excision and the inevitable repair synthesis that must follow could be potential sources of spontaneous mutations. Our data suggest that even in nondividing cells in which there is no DNA replication, there can be significant DNA turnover due to gratuitous excision and resynthesis and that this gratuitous “repair” may cause mutations in such cells, even when they are protected from all extrinsic and intrinsic DNA damaging agents.DISCUSSIONOur findings raise two questions: why and how is the undamaged DNA attacked by the excision nuclease, and what is the biological role of gratuitous DNA repair? These questions are addressed below.Attack of Excision Nuclease on Undamaged DNAThe precise mechanism of damage recognition by human excision nuclease is not known. Hence, at present, it is not possible to answer the questions of why and how the enzyme attacks undamaged DNA in any detail. Based on the structure of a preincision DNA-enzyme complex, which contains a subset of the repair factors and partially unwound and kinked DNA (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar,2Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 7Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13Wakasugi M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that any DNA structure that is amenable to unwinding and kinking and otherwise assuming the conformation existing in the ultimate preincision complex might function as a substrate (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 5Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Buschta-Hedayat N. Buterin T. Hess M.T. Missura M. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6090-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since even undamaged DNA can assume the conformation of the preincision complex with low but finite probability (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that undamaged DNA is a substrate for excision nucleases. Indeed, there have been reports on incision of undamaged DNA by the E. coli excinuclease (19Van Houten B. Sancar A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 540-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Caron P.R. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7855-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In one of those studies, however, uniformly radiolabeled plasmid DNA was used in a nicking assay that is incapable of detecting an excinuclease mode of action (19Van Houten B. Sancar A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 540-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second study used linear DNA uniformly labeled with 32P as a substrate in an excision assay, and 9-nt-long oligomers were released instead of the characteristic 12–13-nt-long oligomers (20Caron P.R. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7855-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Later work revealed that the 9-mers are released by a potent 3′-exonuclease action of the UvrABC proteins at a nick or a double-strand break (21Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Moolenaar G.F. Bazuine M. van Knippenberg I.C. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34896-34903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and hence the product was not released by an excinuclease type of action (dual incisions in one strand). In this study we present unambiguous evidence that both the human and the E. coli excision nucleases attack undamaged DNA in the typical excinuclease mode.It is very likely that certain DNA sequences would be more susceptible to attack by excision nuclease than others. We have tested three different random sequences and found a similar level of excision by the excision nuclease. A more extensive survey, however, is likely to identify certain sequences and conformations with increased susceptibility to excision nuclease. Indeed, a recent study (23Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has shown that the poly(purine:pyrimidine) tract present in the polycystic kidney disease gene (PKD1) when present in a supercoiled plasmid is efficiently processed by the E. coliexcinuclease. An extreme case of the effect of DNA conformation on gratuitous repair is the form of gratuitous repair that has been proposed to occur as a side product of transcription-repair coupling (24Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 25Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that when RNA polymerase stalls at natural transcriptional pause sites the transcription-coupled repair machinery is activated in a manner similar to RNA polymerase stalling at a lesion and that such activation of the transcription-coupled repair system leads to gratuitous and potentially mutagenic repair. Currently there is no experimental evidence for gratuitous repair initiated by stalled RNA polymerase. However, there are several reports that show that transcribed DNA is mutated at higher frequency than nontranscribed DNA (26Fix D.F. Glickman B.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Davis B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5005-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Datta A. Jinks-Robertson S. Science. 1995; 268: 1616-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Beletskii A. Bhagwat A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13919-13924Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whether this increased mutation frequency is due to transcription-coupled gratuitous DNA repair or the increased susceptibility of single-stranded DNA in the transcription bubble to various DNA damaging agents is not known at present.Biological Relevance of Gratuitous RepairWe suspect that gratuitous excision repair has no beneficial effect for the organism. Removal and replacement of undamaged DNA by nucleotide excision repair is the price the cell has to pay to have an omnipotent DNA repair enzyme capable of handling a virtually infinite variety of lesions. This excision and resynthesis may not be totally innocuous, since it may introduce spontaneous mutations into undamaged DNA as is shown in the following calculation.Fig. 5 compares the relative efficiency of human excision nuclease on a variety of lesions and on undamaged DNA. As is apparent, with the unique substrate and assay system we use, undamaged DNA is excised at a rate of about 1% that of the (6-4) photoproduct, which is the best natural substrate for the enzyme and is used as the “gold standard” for other substrates. However, in calculating the susceptibility of undamaged DNA to excision nuclease activity with the (6-4) photoproduct as a reference, a correction factor must be introduced for the relative abundance of the targets. Essentially all of the excision products from the (6-4) substrate arise from a single lesion, whereas the excision products from undamaged DNA arise from dual incisions over about a 50-nucleotide region in a variety of combinations that bracket the radiolabel (Fig.6). Hence, in calculating the efficiency of the enzyme on an undamaged nucleotide, a correction factor of 50 is introduced, making the actual efficiency of an undamaged base relative to that of a (6-4) photoproduct equal to about 1/(50 × 100) = 2 × 10−4. This might seem insignificant, but if one considers that every nucleotide in the human genome complement is a potential target for attack by the excision nuclease, the level of excision of undamaged DNA becomes significant. The maximum rate of excision of (6-4) photoproducts under substrate saturating condition has been estimated to be 2.7 × 103/min/diploid human cell (30Ye N. Bianchi M.S. Bianchi N.O. Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Assuming that the relative rates we obtained in vitro are applicable to the in vivo environment, it is predicted that every minute (2.7 × 103) × (2 × 10−4) = 5.4 × 10−1 undamaged nucleotides would be subject to excinuclease action, and since each excision event removes about 25 nucleotides, it is calculated that 5.4 × 10−1 × 25 = 13.5 nucleotides/min are removed by the human excision nuclease. This, in turn, means excision and replacement of about 2 × 104 nucleotides per day per human cell. This value is comparable with the nucleotide turnover that occurs under physiological conditions as a result of base excision repair processing of damaged bases (104 to 105per cell per day) arising from depurination, deamination, oxidation, and methylation (31Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that gratuitous nucleotide excision repair contributes to DNA turnover as much as base excision repairs acting on spontaneous DNA lesions. Gratuitous repair is not necessarily restricted to the nucleotide excision repair system. It has been shown that certain DNA glycosylases also attack undamaged DNA causing gratuitous repair which, under special conditions, can be mutagenic (33Berdal K.G. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Wyatt M.D. Allan J.M. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T.E. Samson L.D. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Mismatch repair, like nucleotide excision repair, has a wide substrate range and many mechanistic similarities to nucleotide excision repair (35Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 36Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and conceivably may perform gratuitous repair. Since the mismatch repair patches, as a rule, are much larger than those of base or nucleotide excision repair, this system as well may contribute to spontaneous mutagenesis.Figure 6Dual incisions releasing labeled oligonucleotides from undamaged and damaged DNA. The (6-4) photoproduct is released mainly by incisions at the 4thphosphodiester bond 3′ and the 24th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the lesion. With undamaged DNA any combination of incisions about 28 nt apart, bracketing the label, release the appropriate size fragments. The dual incisions representing the extreme locations for releasing the label are shown, and any combination of sites between these two extremes will release the radiolabel from undamaged DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ConclusionIn this paper we have shown that DNA with minor backbone modifications and nominally unmodified (undamaged) DNA are attacked by the human and E. coli excision nucleases. The concern that the nominally undamaged DNA may in fact contain some cryptic damage can never be unequivocally eliminated. We feel, however, that the excision we observe from undamaged DNA does represent attack on truly undamaged DNA for the following reasons. First, using an analytical probe for the most common spontaneous lesion in DNA, 8-oxoG, we demonstrate that the level of this lesion in our synthetic substrate is well below the level required to account for the level of excision we observe for such undamaged substrate. Second, the fact that even such a minor modification as the replacement of an oxygen by a sulfur in the backbone increases the susceptibility of DNA to the excision nuclease leads to the reasonably logical conclusion that substrate and nonsubstrate DNA are not quantized for the excision nuclease. Instead it suggests that DNA structures ranging from gross distortions to no distortion represent the two extremes of the continuum of excision nuclease substrates. Nucleotide excision repair is a general repair system that removes damaged bases from DNA by dual incisions of the damaged strand at some distance from the lesion, releasing the damaged base in the form of 12–13-mers in prokaryotes and 24–32-mers in eukaryotes (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 2Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It is the major repair system for bulky base adducts, but it also acts on nonbulky lesions such as oxidized or methylated bases and, as such, functions as a backup system for DNA glycosylases, which have restricted substrate ranges (3Huang J.C.

The wide substrate spectrum of the excision nuclease raises two interrelated questions: what is the substrate range of the enzyme system and how does the enzyme recognize substrate? Both of these questions have been addressed in numerous studies, and at present we have a basic understanding of damage recognition in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 2Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 5Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6090-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). With regard to substrate range, its limits remain to be defined. The excision nuclease, which originally was thought to be specific for bulky lesions, was later found to excise nonbulky adducts such as methylated bases but, apparently, failed to excise nucleotides with backbone modifications such as the C4′ pivaloyl adduct (5Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Buschta-Hedayat N. Buterin T. Hess M.T. Missura M. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6090-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). With the availability of more efficient in vitro systems (4Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) we decided to re-examine the question of recognition of backbone modifications. We found that both phosphorothioate and methylphosphonate backbone modifications were recognized as substrates by the human excision nuclease. This, in turn, led us to take a closer look at the effect of the enzyme system on undamaged DNA. We find that both the human and the Escherichia coli excision nucleases excise oligomers of 23–28 and 12–13 nucleotides, respectively, from undamaged DNA. This gratuitous excision and the inevitable repair synthesis that must follow could be potential sources of spontaneous mutations. Our data suggest that even in nondividing cells in which there is no DNA replication, there can be significant DNA turnover due to gratuitous excision and resynthesis and that this gratuitous “repair” may cause mutations in such cells, even when they are protected from all extrinsic and intrinsic DNA damaging agents. DISCUSSIONOur findings raise two questions: why and how is the undamaged DNA attacked by the excision nuclease, and what is the biological role of gratuitous DNA repair? These questions are addressed below.Attack of Excision Nuclease on Undamaged DNAThe precise mechanism of damage recognition by human excision nuclease is not known. Hence, at present, it is not possible to answer the questions of why and how the enzyme attacks undamaged DNA in any detail. Based on the structure of a preincision DNA-enzyme complex, which contains a subset of the repair factors and partially unwound and kinked DNA (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar,2Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 7Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that any DNA structure that is amenable to unwinding and kinking and otherwise assuming the conformation existing in the ultimate preincision complex might function as a substrate (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 5Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Buschta-Hedayat N. Buterin T. Hess M.T. Missura M. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6090-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since even undamaged DNA can assume the conformation of the preincision complex with low but finite probability (1Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that undamaged DNA is a substrate for excision nucleases. Indeed, there have been reports on incision of undamaged DNA by the E. coli excinuclease (19Van Houten B. Sancar A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 540-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Caron P.R. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7855-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In one of those studies, however, uniformly radiolabeled plasmid DNA was used in a nicking assay that is incapable of detecting an excinuclease mode of action (19Van Houten B. Sancar A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 540-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second study used linear DNA uniformly labeled with 32P as a substrate in an excision assay, and 9-nt-long oligomers were released instead of the characteristic 12–13-nt-long oligomers (20Caron P.R. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7855-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Later work revealed that the 9-mers are released by a potent 3′-exonuclease action of the UvrABC proteins at a nick or a double-strand break (21Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Moolenaar G.F. Bazuine M. van Knippenberg I.C. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34896-34903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and hence the product was not released by an excinuclease type of action (dual incisions in one strand). In this study we present unambiguous evidence that both the human and the E. coli excision nucleases attack undamaged DNA in the typical excinuclease mode.It is very likely that certain DNA sequences would be more susceptible to attack by excision nuclease than others. We have tested three different random sequences and found a similar level of excision by the excision nuclease. A more extensive survey, however, is likely to identify certain sequences and conformations with increased susceptibility to excision nuclease. Indeed, a recent study (23Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has shown that the poly(purine:pyrimidine) tract present in the polycystic kidney disease gene (PKD1) when present in a supercoiled plasmid is efficiently processed by the E. coliexcinuclease. An extreme case of the effect of DNA conformation on gratuitous repair is the form of gratuitous repair that has been proposed to occur as a side product of transcription-repair coupling (24Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 25Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that when RNA polymerase stalls at natural transcriptional pause sites the transcription-coupled repair machinery is activated in a manner similar to RNA polymerase stalling at a lesion and that such activation of the transcription-coupled repair system leads to gratuitous and potentially mutagenic repair. Currently there is no experimental evidence for gratuitous repair initiated by stalled RNA polymerase. However, there are several reports that show that transcribed DNA is mutated at higher frequency than nontranscribed DNA (26Fix D.F. Glickman B.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Davis B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5005-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Datta A. Jinks-Robertson S. Science. 1995; 268: 1616-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Beletskii A. Bhagwat A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13919-13924Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whether this increased mutation frequency is due to transcription-coupled gratuitous DNA repair or the increased susceptibility of single-stranded DNA in the transcription bubble to various DNA damaging agents is not known at present.Biological Relevance of Gratuitous RepairWe suspect that gratuitous excision repair has no beneficial effect for the organism. Removal and replacement of undamaged DNA by nucleotide excision repair is the price the cell has to pay to have an omnipotent DNA repair enzyme capable of handling a virtually infinite variety of lesions. This excision and resynthesis may not be totally innocuous, since it may introduce spontaneous mutations into undamaged DNA as is shown in the following calculation.Fig. 5 compares the relative efficiency of human excision nuclease on a variety of lesions and on undamaged DNA. As is apparent, with the unique substrate and assay system we use, undamaged DNA is excised at a rate of about 1% that of the (6-4) photoproduct, which is the best natural substrate for the enzyme and is used as the “gold standard” for other substrates. However, in calculating the susceptibility of undamaged DNA to excision nuclease activity with the (6-4) photoproduct as a reference, a correction factor must be introduced for the relative abundance of the targets. Essentially all of the excision products from the (6-4) substrate arise from a single lesion, whereas the excision products from undamaged DNA arise from dual incisions over about a 50-nucleotide region in a variety of combinations that bracket the radiolabel (Fig.6). Hence, in calculating the efficiency of the enzyme on an undamaged nucleotide, a correction factor of 50 is introduced, making the actual efficiency of an undamaged base relative to that of a (6-4) photoproduct equal to about 1/(50 × 100) = 2 × 10−4. This might seem insignificant, but if one considers that every nucleotide in the human genome complement is a potential target for attack by the excision nuclease, the level of excision of undamaged DNA becomes significant. The maximum rate of excision of (6-4) photoproducts under substrate saturating condition has been estimated to be 2.7 × 103/min/diploid human cell (30Ye N. Bianchi M.S. Bianchi N.O. Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Assuming that the relative rates we obtained in vitro are applicable to the in vivo environment, it is predicted that every minute (2.7 × 103) × (2 × 10−4) = 5.4 × 10−1 undamaged nucleotides would be subject to excinuclease action, and since each excision event removes about 25 nucleotides, it is calculated that 5.4 × 10−1 × 25 = 13.5 nucleotides/min are removed by the human excision nuclease. This, in turn, means e"

The MEK1 N terminus contains the ERK docking or D domain that consists of conserved hydrophobic and basic residues. We mutated the hydrophobic and basic residues individually and found that loss of either type reduced MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK2 in vitroand its ability to bind to ERK2 in vivo. Moreover, ERK2 was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus when co-expressed with MEK1 that had mutations in either the hydrophobic or the basic residues. We then identified two conserved hydrophobic residues on ERK2 that play roles in docking with MEK1. Mutating these residues to alanine reduced the interaction of ERK2 with MEK1 in cells. These mutations also reduced the phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2 but had little effect on phosphorylation of MBP by ERK2. Finally, we generated docking site mutants in ERK2-MEK1 fusion proteins. Although the mutation of the MEK1 D domain significantly reduced ERK2-MEK1 activity, mutations of the putatively complementary acidic residues and hydrophobic residues on ERK2 did not change its activity. However, both types of mutations decreased the phosphorylation of Elk-1 caused by ERK2-MEK1 fusion proteins. These findings suggest complex interactions of MEK1 D domains with ERK2 that influence its activation and its effects on substrates.

A typical MAP kinase pathway consists of at least three kinases: a MEKK that phosphorylates and activates the downstream kinase MEK; a MEK that phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinase; and the MAP kinase that has a variety of targets. The most studied mammalian MAP kinase pathway is the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Upon activation of the pathway, Raf-1 phosphorylates two serine residues in the activation loop of MEK1/2, and MEK1/2 in turn will phosphorylate a threonine and a tyrosine in the activation loop of ERK1/2. MAP kinase docking domains have been identified in ERK1/2 substrates, including transcription factors and protein kinases. The most thoroughly characterized MAP kinase docking domain is the D domain originally identified in the ternary complex factor Elk-1 (4Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These docking domains have now been recognized not only in substrates but also in the upstream kinases, MEK1 and MEK2, and in dual specificity and phosphotyrosine phosphatases (5Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 6Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The typical D domain contains a cluster of basic residues followed by two conserved hydrophobic residues (e.g. KKKPTPIQL in MEK1). The MEK1 D domain is required for efficient phosphorylation and activation of ERK2 and for interaction with ERK2 in cells (7Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Deletion of the MEK1 D domain decreases not only the feedback phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2 but also the phosphorylation of ERK2 by MEK1 in vitro (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). D domains are also necessary for inactivation of MAP kinases by some of the phosphatases. The protein kinase substrates of MAP kinases including RSKs and MNKs contain variants of the D domain motif, having a typical sequence LAQRR (5Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar,10Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 9: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This domain on RSK interacts with ERK2 directly and is required for intracellular recognition by ERK2. Another ERK docking motif found in transcription factors such as Elk-1, SAP-1, and LIN-1 is the FXFP sequence (13Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It can work by itself or together with a D domain to mediate kinase-substrate interactions. Different experimental approaches have revealed multiple domains on ERKs that are involved in docking interactions with MEKs and substrates. Two groups independently identified a common docking (CD) motif, found in all known MAP kinase family members, that mediates interactions with MEKs, MAP kinase phosphatase 3, and the protein kinase substrate MNK1 (9Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 14Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The CD domain is located near the C termini of MAP kinases and contains two acidic residues that are thought to interact directly with the basic residues in D domains. Several studies with MAP kinase chimeras suggested that ERK1/2 residues in the N-terminal folding domain of the kinase are also important; these include the C helix and the ERK2 N terminus (8Xu B.

In this study, we examined the importance of the conserved hydrophobic and basic residues in the MEK1 D domain to its ability to phosphorylate ERK2 in vitro and interact with ERK2 in vivo. In addition, two tyrosine residues near the CD domain on ERK2 were identified as being important for MEK1 interaction. We also tested the effects of the docking site mutations on the activation and activity of ERK2-MEK1 fusion proteins (18Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr.

For immune complex kinase assays, equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with the corresponding antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads.

For MEK1-ERK2 co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Myc-tagged MEK1 or ERK2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from 0.8 mg of cell lysates with the anti-Myc antibody and 50 µl of protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were then washed three times in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunofluorescence was performed as described (20Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

The reactions (20 µl) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Immunoblots were developed essentially as described using enhanced chemiluminescence (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were maintained, transfected, and harvested as described (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 (1%) was present in the lysis buffer except for in MEK1-ERK2 co-immunoprecipitation experiments, in which no detergent was added to the lysis buffer. The unphosphorylated ERK2 structure was created based on the published data using the Insight II (Molecular Biosystems) program. The MEK1 N terminus contains an ERK docking or D domain; this domain is also present in phosphatases and substrates of ERK1/2 (5Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Within the MEK1 D domain, a cluster of basic residues and two hydrophobic residues are well conserved among MEKs across species (Fig.1 A). Previously, we showed that deletion of the MEK1 N terminus, including the D domain, reduced its ability to phosphorylate ERK2 in vitro (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the individual contributions of these conserved residues in the MEK1 D domain by creating point mutants (Table I). HEK 293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged wild type MEK1 or MEK1 mutants. The cells either were left untreated or were treated with EGF prior to harvest. MEK1 was then immunoprecipitated using the anti-Myc antibody, and its kinase activity was assayed using GST-ERK2 (K52R) as the substrate (Fig. 1 B). EGF enhanced the activities of wild type MEK1 along with the MEK1 mutants toward ERK2 in vitro. However, both the ILAA mutant and the KKMM mutant showed much reduced activity either with or without EGF stimulation, indicating that both the conserved hydrophobic residues and the basic residues in the MEK1 D domain are required for efficient ERK2 phosphorylation. These results are similar to those observed with MEK1 lacking the D domain (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that a MEK1 N-terminal peptide (P1) that contains the D domain was able to inhibit the feedback phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2 (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here we examined whether this peptide would inhibit MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK2. His-tagged, constitutively active MEK1 (S218E/S222D) was used to phosphorylate GST-ERK2 (K52R) in the presence of increasing amounts of P1 or the control peptide P2, which lacks the D domain sequence (Fig.2). Clear inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation by MEK1 was observed with the P1 peptide at 20 µm. At 200 µm P1, nearly complete inhibition was achieved, similar to what was seen with the feedback phosphorylation (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the control P2 peptide had little effect on MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK2 even at the highest concentration (200 µm). In contrast, neither P1 nor P2 had any effect on the ability of MEK1-ΔN1, which does not contain the D domain, to phosphorylate GST-ERK2 (K52R) in vitro (data not shown). These results indicated that a functional D domain peptide could efficiently inhibit MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK2. The N-terminal D domain of MEK1 is apparently both required and sufficient for binding to ERK2 (7Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). We previously showed that a MEK1 N-terminal deletion mutant (MEK1-ΔN1) failed to co-immunoprecipitate with ERK2 (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here we tested the ability of the MEK1 ILAA and KKMM mutants to co-immunoprecipitate with ERK2. 293 cells were co-transfected with HA-ERK2 and pCMV5-Myc vector control, wild type MEK1, or the MEK1 mutants. Myc-tagged MEK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, and the presence of HA-ERK2 was examined by blotting the immunoprecipitates with the anti-HA antibody. Although wild type MEK1 showed strong co-immunoprecipitation with HA-ERK2, both the ILAA mutant and the KKMM mutant showed a dramatically decreased ability to associate with ERK2 (Fig. 3 A). These results clearly demonstrate that both the hydrophobic and the basic residues in the MEK1 D domain are required for its association with ERK2. Overexpressed ERK2 accumulates in the nucleus (7Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 14Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MEK1 can restrict ERK2 to a cytoplasmic localization in quiescent cells. Because the MEK1 D domain mutants were defective in interacting with ERK2, we tested whether they would still be able to cause ERK2 to be in the cytoplasm. 293 cells were co-transfected with HA-ERK2 and either the vector control or the Myc-MEK1 (wild type and mutants). The subcellular localization of HA-ERK2 was visualized by immunofluorescence using the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3 B). In the absence of MEK1, overexpressed ERK2 was present in both cytoplasm and nucleus as previously reported. In the presence of wild type MEK1, ERK2 was predominantly in the cytoplasm, consistent with the ability of MEK1 to remove ERK2 from the nucleus. However, in the presence of either the ILAA MEK1 mutant or the KKMM MEK1 mutant, ERK2 was distributed throughout the cell, with a substantial amount in the nucleus. The localization is similar to that in cells in which MEK1 was not overexpressed. These data indicate that both the hydrophobic and basic residues are necessary for MEK1 to exclude overexpressed ERK2 from the nucleus in unstimulated cells. Several regions on ERK2 have been identified as being important for MEK1 interaction (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat.

Biol. 2001; 21: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Among these, the so-called CD domain near the C terminus of ERK2 that contains two acidic residues (Asp316 and Asp319) has been proposed to interact directly with the basic residues in the MEK1 D domain (9Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 14Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the two hydrophobic residues in the MEK1 D domain are important for MEK1-ERK2 interaction, we speculated that there would be hydrophobic residues near the CD domain on ERK2 that could play roles in docking with MEK1. By examining the primary sequence of ERK2 and other MAP kinases, we noticed that Tyr314 and Tyr315 in ERK2 are residues with large side chains (Tyr, His, or Trp) in all MAP kinase family members (Fig.4 A). The crystal structure of ERK2 shows that the side chains of both Tyr314 and Tyr315 are exposed on the surface (22Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), not buried inside the molecule, suggesting that they may be involved in interacting with other proteins (Fig. 4 B). Tyr314 and Tyr315 were mutated to alanine to generate the YYAA ERK2 mutant. The CD domain residues Asp316 and Asp319 along with Glu320were also mutated to alanine to generate the AAA ERK2 mutant. Asp316 and Asp319 alone were mutated to alanine to generate the DDAA ERK2 mutant. Finally, all five residues were mutated to alanine to generate the 5A ERK2 mutant (Table I). Vector control, Myc-tagged wild type ERK2, or ERK2 mutants were co-transfected into 293 cells with HA-MEK1. ERK2 proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, and the presence of HA-MEK1 in the ERK2 immunoprecipitates was examined by blotting with the anti-HA antibody. As expected, wild type ERK2 precipitated a significant amount of MEK1 protein. In contrast, all three ERK2 mutants tested in the assay extracted less MEK1 from the lysates (Fig.5 A). These findings suggest that both Tyr314/Tyr315 and Asp316/Asp319/Glu320 are important for interacting with MEK1 in cells. We next examined the effects of these mutations on the kinase activity of ERK2. Myc-tagged ERK2, wild type and mutants, were co-transfected into 293 cells with a constitutively active form of MEK1. ERK2 proteins were then immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody and assayed for their kinase activity using either MBP or His-MEK1 (K97M) as substrates (Fig. 5 B). Wild type ERK2 and the ERK2 mutants showed comparable activity toward MBP, indicating that all of the ERK2 mutants were phosphorylated and activated in cells by overexpressed, active MEK1. When His-MEK1 was used as the substrate, the YYAA mutant showed a modest but reproducibly decreased kinase activity toward it compared with that catalyzed by wild type ERK2. Although the AAA mutant showed a clearly decreased phosphorylation, the 5A mutant had even less activity toward MEK1. Similar results were achieved when lysates from EGF-treated or Ras-V12 co-transfected cells were used instead (data not shown). These results indicate that not only the acidic residues of the CD domain but also the tyrosine residues near the CD domain are important for the interaction of ERK2 with MEK1. To examine the MEK1-ERK2 docking interaction under circumstances in which the proteins are covalently bound, we introduced specific mutations into ERK2-MEK1 fusion proteins. A constitutively active form of ERK2 was created by covalently linking ERK2 to MEK1 (18Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant form of the fusion protein ERK2-MEK1 (LA), which replaces four leucine residues in the MEK1 nuclear export sequence with alanine, has higher activity than the wild type fusion protein. To test whether docking domain mutations would affect the ERK2-MEK1 fusion proteins, we made fusion protein mutants in both the MEK1 D domain and the ERK2 CD domain. Myc-tagged ERK2-MEK1 fusions (wild type and mutants) were immunoprecipitated from transfected 293 cell lysates and assayed for kinase activity using MBP as the substrate, so that effects of ERK2 activation could be assessed using a substrate that does not contain a D domain (Fig. 6 A). Surprisingly, MEK1 ILAA mutations greatly reduced ERK2-MEK1 (LA) activity, whereas the KKMM mutations reduced its activity modestly. These results indicated that the MEK1-ERK2 docking interaction is required for ERK2 activation even when ERK2 and MEK1 are covalently linked to each other. Interestingly, neither the ERK2 YYAA nor the DDAA mutations had much effect on ERK2 activity in the ERK2-MEK1 (LA) fusion. To confirm results from these activity assays, we also performed anti-phospho-ERK1/2 blots on the ERK2-MEK1 fusion proteins with the same set of protein lysates. Overall, results were comparable with those from the kinase assays with MBP as substrate. Similar results were obtained with both ERK2-MEK1 and ERK2-MEK1 (LA) fusion proteins and mutants. To examine whether these docking site mutations in ERK2-MEK1 fusion proteins affect their ability to phosphorylate and activate the ternary complex transcription factor Elk-1, wild type and mutant ERK2-MEK1 fusion constructs were transfected into 293 cells along with pCMV5-His-Elk-1. An antibody that specifically recognizes Elk-1 phosphorylated on Ser383 was used to detect the phosphorylated, active forms of Elk-1 (Fig. 6 B). As shown before, ERK2-MEK1 (LA) caused significant activation of Elk-1, whereas the ERK2-MEK1 fusion, which is excluded from the nucleus, had no effect on Elk-1 (18Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, both the MEK1 D domain mutants (ILAA and KKMM) and the ERK2 mutants (YYAA and AAA) decreased Elk-1 activation caused by ERK2-MEK1 (LA). Because the fusion proteins with D domain mutations contain ERK2 that is less active than the wild type ERK2-MEK1 (LA), the reduced phosphorylation of Elk-1 may simply be a consequence of reduced ERK2 activity in these mutant fusion proteins. However, the activities of the fusion proteins containing the ERK2 mutations YYAA and AAA are the same as that of wild type ERK2-MEK1 (LA). Thus, their reduced activities toward Elk-1 suggest that these mutations impair the interaction of ERK2 with Elk-1. Recently, docking between MAP kinases and their substrates has emerged as a recurring theme to ensure efficient enzymatic reactions and signal transmission (5Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 6Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The selective recognition of the binding motifs on substrates by MAP kinases also increases the specificity of each pathway (11Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Zoltoski A.J. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31588-31593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It appears that multiple regions on MAP kinases are involved in substrate recognition and interactions (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,9Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat.

Here we present evidence that both the hydrophobic and basic residues conserved in the MEK1 D domain are required for its efficient phosphorylation of ERK2 in vitro. A MEK1 N-terminal peptide containing the D domain motif not only inhibits the feedback phosphorylation of MEK1 by ERK2; it also inhibits MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK2 in vitro. Mutants that lack either the hydrophobic or the basic residues are defective in binding to ERK2 in vivo, as shown by weaker co-immunoprecipitation compared with wild type MEK1. Although wild type MEK1 is able to retain overexpressed ERK2 in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells, these MEK1 mutants cannot. We also identified two conserved hydrophobic residues near the CD domain of ERK2 that contribute to the interaction of ERK2 with MEK1. First, mutation of the previously identified acidic residues or these hydrophobic residues weakens binding to MEK1 compared with that displayed by wild type ERK2. Second, both types of mutants phosphorylate MEK1 less well in vitro. The results suggest that both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are involved in MEK1-ERK2 docking. The hydrophobic residues we identified in ERK2, tyrosine 314 and 315, are in close proximity to the CD domain aspartic acids, residues 316 and 319, in the three-dimensional structure, and their side chains are exposed. Interestingly, Rubinfeld et al. (14Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) identified the CD domain on ERK2 as a cytoplasmic retention sequence. They observed a stronger defect with the mutant that has alanine substituted for residues 312–319 than the mutant that has alanine substituted only for the three acidic residues, Asp316, Asp319, and Glu320, suggesting that there are additional residues between 312 and 318 involved in MEK1 interaction. Our findings here are consistent with their results. Tyr314 and Tyr315 may interact directly with the hydrophobic residues in the MEK1 D domain. Alternatively, they could affect MEK1-ERK2 docking indirectly, either by interaction with other residues on MEK1 or by altering the interface on ERK2 that comprises the docking site. ERK2 also docks with its substrates and phosphatases that inactivate it, presumably via the same sites that recognize MEK1. Our results showing reduced phosphorylation of Elk-1 by the ERK2-MEK1 fusion protein in which these tyrosine residues were mutated suggest that these hydrophobic residues are also important for substrate interactions. It will be interesting to determine the extent to which Tyr314 and Tyr315 interact with D domain-like docking motifs on other proteins. For instance, RSK contains a different docking domain from MEK1 or Elk-1, characterized as the LAQRR motif, and Elk-1 also contains the distinct FXFP docking motif (5Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). By examining the primary sequences of MAP kinases ranging from yeast to human, we found that residues corresponding to Tyr314 and Tyr315 in ERK2 are conserved in that all have large side chains at these positions. It is tempting to speculate that the corresponding residues in other MAP kinases may also be involved in docking with their MEKs. The crystal structure of p38 shows that Tyr311 and His312 are also near the two aspartic acids in the CD domain, and their side chains are exposed (24Wang Z. Harkins P.C. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), 2B.-E Xu, F. Robinson, and M. Cobb, unpublished observation. suggesting they might have similar functions to Tyr314 and Tyr315 on ERK2. An interesting but somewhat surprising result came from our studies using ERK2-MEK1 fusion proteins. Mutations in the MEK1 D domain resulted in a significant decrease of ERK2-MEK1 activity, whereas mutations in the ERK2 CD domain had little effect. With the fusion proteins, ERK2 and MEK1 are covalently bound, so their affinity is not an issue. The fact that MEK1 D domain mutations decreased the fusion protein activity suggests that the orientation of MEK1-ERK2 docking is critical for the efficient phosphorylation and activation of ERK2. On the other hand, neither mutation of Asp316 and Asp319 nor mutation of Tyr314 and Tyr315 of ERK2 in the fusion proteins affected their activity. These results suggest that unlike the D domain, which is the major docking site on MEK1, the CD domain and its vicinity on ERK2 are apparently not significant for this orientation effect, perhaps because of the presence of multiple docking domains on ERK2. Consistent with this idea, our data and results from other groups showed that the ERK2 CD domain mutants are still phosphorylated and activated in cells properly, despite defects they display in various other assays shown here and elsewhere (9Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 14Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Work from Resing and Ahn (25Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using deuterium exchange mass spectrometry shows that the MEK1 N terminus has increased flexibility upon activation. Perhaps the MEK1 D domain helps to orient the otherwise floating MEK1 N terminus onto ERK2, so that disruption of the D domain would have a dramatic effect on MEK1-ERK2 docking. In contrast, the ERK2 structure is relatively rigid so that disruption of the CD domain may not affect MEK1-ERK2 docking in the fusion protein context. An open and evolving question is whether there are additional domains or residues on ERK2 necessary for docking with MEK1. Nishida and co-workers (23Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) recently reported the identification of the ED domain on p38 and ERK2 near the substrate binding pocket that mediates docking interactions with substrates along with the CD domain. However, they did not examine the interaction with MEKs. Eblen et al. (17Eblen S.T. Catling A.D. Assanah M.C. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) recently showed that residues 19–25 at the ERK2 N terminus are required for interaction with MEKs. Studies of ERK-p38 chimeras also suggested motifs in the N-terminal domain of MAP kinases that are necessary for specific interactions with MEKs (8Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Brunet A. Pouysségur J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A model of the interaction of ERK2 with MEK1 suggests that essential points of contact include regions from both of the folded domains of the kinase core as well as the MAP kinase insert in the C-terminal domain (16Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because the properly folded structure of ERK2 is essential for its recognition by MEK1 (26Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14373-14381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutations that impact the global structure of ERK2 may impair MEK recognition in a nonspecific manner. In any case, determination of the crystal structure of the docked proteins should provide substantial information still lacking from mutagenesis studies.

https://openalex.org/W1568976906,"Although α2β1integrin (glycoprotein Ia/IIa) has been established as a platelet collagen receptor, its role in collagen-induced platelet activation has been controversial. Recently, it has been demonstrated that rhodocytin (also termed aggretin), a snake venom toxin purified from the venom ofCalloselasma rhodostoma, induces platelet activation that can be blocked by monoclonal antibodies against α2β1 integrin. This finding suggested that clustering of α2β1 integrin by rhodocytin is sufficient to induce platelet activation and led to the hypothesis that collagen may activate platelets by a similar mechanism. In contrast to these findings, we provided evidence that rhodocytin does not bind to α2β1 integrin. Here we show that the Cre/loxP-mediated loss of β1 integrin on mouse platelets has no effect on rhodocytin-induced platelet activation, excluding an essential role of α2β1integrin in this process. Furthermore, proteolytic cleavage of the 45-kDa N-terminal domain of glycoprotein (GP) Ibα either on normal or on β1-null platelets had no significant effect on rhodocytin-induced platelet activation. Moreover, mouse platelets lacking both α2β1 integrin and the activating collagen receptor GPVI responded normally to rhodocytin. Finally, even after additional proteolytic removal of the 45-kDa N-terminal domain of GPIbα rhodocytin induced aggregation of these platelets.

The interaction between platelets and collagen can either occur indirectly via immobilized von Willebrand factor (vWf)1 binding to platelet receptors glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX and/or activated αIIbβ3 integrin (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) or by direct recognition of collagen by specific receptors expressed on the platelet surface. Several receptors for collagen have been identified on platelets, most importantly the Ig-like receptor GPVI (2Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and α2β1 integrin (3Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In contrast to earlier reports, we have recently shown with β1 integrin-null platelets that α2β1 integrin is not essential for platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen. GPVI, however, was found to be indispensable for this process (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W.M. Zirngibl H. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Although GPVI has been established as the major activating platelet collagen receptor, the way α2β1 integrin modulates the activation process is still unclear. Experimental evidence suggests that collagen contains two distinct epitopes contributing to activation of (murine) platelets. One of these epitopes specifically binds to GPVI, and this interaction is blocked by the anti-GPVI mAb JAQ1 (5Schulte V. Snell D. Bergmeier W. Zirngibl H. Watson S.P. Nieswandt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 364-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation through the second epitope is not blocked by JAQ1 and involves GPVI, α2β1 integrin, and high concentrations of fibrillar collagen (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W.M. Zirngibl H. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying this activation pathway and the role of α2β1 integrin are unclear. In addition to α2β1 and GPVI, other receptors may be involved in this activation pathway. One candidate is GPIbα, because this receptor indirectly interacts with collagen via vWf (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Snake venom-derived proteins are frequently used to study mechanisms of platelet activation and aggregation because many of them specifically bind to platelet surface glycoprotein receptors and interfere with their function.

Recent studies gave rise to conflicting results on the mechanisms underlying this activation process. Several experiments suggested that rhodocytin activates platelets in a collagen-like manner. First, both processes are sensitive to inhibition of thromboxane A2 formation by treatment with acetylsalicylic acid, and, second, both can be inhibited by mAbs against α2β1 integrin (7Suzuki-Inoue K.

Based on these results, the authors concluded that rhodocytin activates platelets by interacting with α2β1 integrin (8Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Others reported that rhodocytin activates platelets through α2β1 integrin and GPIbα (9Navdaev A. Clemetson J.M. Polgar J.

Both hypotheses, however, were challenged by our finding that rhodocytin does not bind recombinant, soluble α2β1 (10Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol.

Moreover, we have recently shown that β1-null platelets fail to express α2β1 integrin but display no reduced response to fibrillar collagen, indicating that α2β1 integrin is not a major signaling collagen receptor on platelets (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W.M. Zirngibl H. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). To directly test whether rhodocytin induces platelet activation by mechanisms similar to those induced by collagen, we now examined the effects of this agonist on platelets lacking α2β1 integrin, GPVI, the ligand-binding domain on GPIbα, or all three of them. The results of these studies demonstrate that none of these receptors is required for platelet activation by rhodocytin. Mice carrying the β1-null allele in megakaryocytes were generated as described previously (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 653-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) were crossed with transgenic mice carrying the Mx-cre transgene (mx-cre+) (14Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Deletion of the β1 gene was induced in 4–5-week-old (β1(fl/fl)/Mx-cre+) mice by three intraperitoneal injections of 250 μg of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid at 2-day intervals. Control mice β1(fl/fl) received the same treatment and were derived from same litters. For experiments, mice were used at least 2 weeks after polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid injection. The absence of the α2 and β1integrin subunits on the platelets from these mice was always confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blotting as described (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W.M. Zirngibl H. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). C57Bl/6 mice deficient in the FcRγ chain (15Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V.

Lanza (Strasbourg, France). Mice were injected with 100 μg of JAQ1 intraperitoneally, and platelets were isolated on day 7. As reported previously, GPVI was not detectable on those platelets by flow cytometry and Western blotting (16Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P.

High molecular weight heparin (Sigma), α-thrombin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), collagen (Nycomed GmbH, Munich, Germany), and O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (Cedarlane, Hornby, Canada) were purchased. Apyrase was purified from potatoes as described previously (17Cazenave J.P. Hemmendinger S. Beretz A. Sutter-Bay A. Launay J. Ann. Biol. Clin. 1983; 41: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylsalicylic acid was from Sanofi-Synthelabo (Paris, France). Botrocetin and purified human vWf were kindly provided by F. Lanza (Strasbourg, France) and G. Dickneite (Marburg, Germany), respectively. C. rhodostoma(Malayain pit viper) venom was purchased from Sigma. Dissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, the venom was separated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column. The eluate fractions of respective size were pooled. After dilution with Mono S-buffer A (20 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.5), the pooled fractions were applied to a Mono S HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Not binding to Mono S resin under these conditions, the rhodocytin in the flow-through was dialyzed against Mono Q buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02% sodium azide) and applied to a Mono Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rhodocytin was eluted from the Mono Q column in a linear NaCl gradient at sodium chloride concentrations above 300 mm. The rhodocytin-containing eluate fraction was concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration in a Centricon 10 tube. Finally, the concentrated solution of rhodocytin was purified by gel filtration on a tandem array of TSK G3000 SWXL and TSK G2000 SWXL (TosoHass, Stuttgart, Germany). Purity was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 12–18% acrylamide separating gel. Protein concentration was assayed by the BCA method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). The rat anti-mouse P-selectin mAb RB40.34 was kindly provided by D. Vestweber (Münster, Germany) and modified in our laboratories. FITC hamster anti-β1 integrin (Ha31/8), FITC hamster anti-α2 integrin, and rat anti-β1 integrin (9EG7) were from BD Pharmingen. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-FITC, polyclonal rabbit anti-fibrinogen, and polyclonal rabbit anti-vWf were purchased from DAKO. All other antibodies were generated, produced, and modified in our laboratories: JAQ1 (anti-GPVI) (11Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Rackebrandt K. Gessner J.E. Zirngibl H. J. Biol.

Blood. 2000; 96: 2520-2527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were bled under ether anesthesia from the retroorbital plexus. The blood was collected in a tube containing 10% (v/v) 7.5 units/ml heparin, and platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelets were washed twice in Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin and finally resuspended at a density of 2 × 105platelets/μl in the same buffer in the presence of 0.02 unit/ml of the ADP scavenger apyrase, a concentration sufficient to prevent desensitization of platelet ADP receptors during storage. Platelets were kept at 37 °C throughout all experiments. Platelets (108) were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40; all from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After lysis, whole cell extract was run on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was first incubated with 5 μg/ml FITC-labeled mAb followed by rabbit anti-FITC-horseradish peroxidase (1 μg/ml). The proteins were visualized by ECL. Washed platelets (2 × 106) were incubated with the indicated amounts of agonists for 5 min followed by staining with fluorophore-conjugated Abs (5 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C and immediately analyzed on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). Platelets were gated by forward scatter/side scatter characteristics. The washed platelets (2 × 109/ml) were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 100 μg/ml O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase. Aliquots of the platelet suspensions were analyzed in flow cytometry and Western blotting to estimate markers of platelet activation and alterations in platelet glycoproteins. To determine platelet aggregation, light transmission was measured using washed platelets (200 μl with 0.5 × 106 platelets/μl). Transmission was recorded on a Fibrintimer 4 channel aggregometer (LAbor, Hamburg, Germany) over 10 min and was expressed as arbitrary units with 100% transmission adjusted with Tyrode's buffer. It has been reported that rhodocytin induces platelet aggregation by interacting with the collagen receptor α2β1 integrin. Based on these results, it was suggested that collagen might also activate platelets via α2β1 integrin (7Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1643-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings were challenged by our result showing that rhodocytin does not bind to a recombinant soluble form of α2β1 integrin (10Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To directly investigate whether rhodocytin activates platelets through mechanisms similar to those induced by collagen, we compared the effects of rhodocytin and fibrillar collagen on mouse platelets lacking the collagen receptors α2β1 integrin and GPVI. As reported previously, FcRγ chain-deficient platelets lack GPVI but express normal amounts of α2β1integrin (Fig. 1a) and do not respond to collagen (11Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Schulte V.

In contrast, platelets from mice with a Cre/loxP-mediated deletion of the β1 gene in megakaryocytes lack all β1integrins but express normal amounts of GPVI (Fig. 1a). β1-null platelets display delayed but not reduced aggregation to fibrillar collagen (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W.M. Zirngibl H. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). The effects of rhodocytin on mouse platelets were similar to those reported for human platelets (7Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1643-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Inoue K.

Aggregation occurred with a dose-dependent lag phase (Fig.2a) and was sensitive to inhibitors of the thromboxane A2-producing system (not shown). Platelet activation by rhodocytin occurred independently of GPVI/FcRγ (Fig. 2a) and was accompanied by marked degranulation (as shown by P-selectin expression) and strong fibrinogen binding (Fig. 2b). Strikingly, rhodocytin also induced aggregation of β1-null platelets. The extent of degranulation and fibrinogen binding was indistinguishable between β1-null and control platelets (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, no differences were found in the dose-response characteristics between normal and β1-null platelets (not shown). These results demonstrate that β1 integrins, including α2β1, are not essential for rhodocytin-induced platelet activation. It has been shown that snake venom toxins may induce platelet activation by interacting with multiple receptors (20Dormann D. Clemetson J.M. Navdaev A. Kehrel B.E. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, blocking only one of them would not inhibit platelet activation/aggregation. Therefore, we examined the effects of rhodocytin on platelets lacking both α2β1 and GPVI. To generate such platelets, GPVI was depleted in mice with β1-null platelets by injection of JAQ1 (100 μg/mouse). This treatment induces a virtually complete internalization and proteolytic degradation of GPVI in circulating platelets but does not affect other receptors, including αIIbβ3, GPIb-V-IX, and CD9 (16Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Gachet C. Zirngibl H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). GPVI-depleted platelets do not respond to collagen, whereas activation by other agonists is not affected (16Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Gachet C. Zirngibl H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3a, platelets from JAQ1-treated β1-null mice lacked both collagen receptors. However, these β1/GPVI-deficient platelets responded normally to rhodocytin as demonstrated by aggregometry and flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3, b and c). This finding excludes an essential role of α2β1and GPVI in rhodocytin-induced platelet activation. A very recent report showed that rhodocytin (aggretin)-induced platelet activation was inhibited by a mAb against the 45-kDa N-terminal domain on GPIbα (9Navdaev A. Clemetson J.M. Polgar J.

This domain contains the binding sites for all known ligands, including vWf, thrombin (21Lopez J.A. Dong J.F. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), P-selectin (22Romo G.M. Dong J.F. Schade A.J. Gardiner E.E. Kansas G.S. Li C.Q. McIntire L.V. Berndt M.C. Lopez J.A. J. Exp.

Clemetson J.M. Navdaev A. Kehrel B.E. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and echicetin (25Peng M. Lu W. Beviglia L. Niewiarowski S. Kirby E.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on their results, Navdaev et al. (9Navdaev A. Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Kehrel B.E. Glauner M. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20882-20889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) concluded that GPIbα plays an essential role in rhodocytin-induced platelet activation. To directly test this hypothesis, we treated platelets withO-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (26Liu L. Freedman J. Hornstein A. Fenton J.W. Song Y. Ofosu F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1997-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in complete proteolytic removal of the 45-kDa N-terminal domain of GPIbα as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis (Fig.4a). Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed that, in addition to cleavage of the 45-kDa N-terminal domain, the truncated remainder of GPIbα (105 kDa) was further cleaved in close vicinity to the transmembrane region of GPIbα, resulting in the release of glycocalicin lacking the 45-kDa N-terminal region (∼85 kDa) (Fig. 4b). Because of the complete lack of the 45-kDa N-terminal domain of GPIbα, botrocetin-induced vWf binding was abolished inO-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase-treated platelets (Fig.4c). However, these platelets responded normally to rhodocytin (Fig. 4, d and e), demonstrating that the ligand-binding domain on GPIbα is not essential for this activation process. Although our results demonstrated that neither the collagen receptors α2β1 integrin and GPVI nor GPIbα are essential for rhodocytin-induced platelet activation, it could not be excluded that rhodocytin binds to all three receptors that independently elicit aggregation. Therefore, we removed the 45-kDa N-terminal region of GPIbα from β1- and β1/GPVI-deficient platelets and examined their response to rhodocytin. As shown in Fig. 5, even the absences of α2β1, GPVI, and the 45-kDa N-terminal domain of GPIbα had no significant effect on rhodocytin-induced platelet activation and aggregation. The mechanism underlying platelet activation by rhodocytin (aggretin) has been debated. Several investigators suggested that rhodocytin activates platelets in a collagen-like manner by interacting with α2β1 integrin or α2β1 integrin and GPIbα (7Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y.

Kehrel B.E. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast to these hypotheses, we reported that rhodocytin does not bind to α2β1 integrin (10Eble J.A. Beermann B. Hinz H.J. Schmidt-Hederich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12274-12284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that rhodocytin induces activation of murine platelets in the absence of α2β1integrin, GPVI, and the ligand-binding domain of GPIbα. These are the three major receptors that directly or indirectly interact with collagen. Our findings exclude an essential role for these receptors in rhodocytin-induced activation and demonstrate that the activation process follows mechanisms that are fundamentally different from those induced by collagen. Our present findings are in contrast to those reported by others (7Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1643-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Navdaev A. Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Kehrel B.E. Glauner M. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J.

An explanation for this discrepancy could be that treatment of platelets with mAbs against α2β1 may have different effects than the absence of the receptor. Antibodies may exert steric effects on other cell surface proteins or may elicit inhibitory signals. Previously, results from inhibition studies with some antibodies against α2β1 could not be confirmed in a genetic model in which the β1 gene is deleted in all hematopoietic cells, including megakaryocytes. It was shown that antibodies against α2β1 integrin markedly reduced or abolished platelet adhesion and aggregate formation on collagen in stasis and flow (27Saelman E.U. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Hese K.M. de Groot P.G. Heijnen H.F. Sage E.H. Williams S. McKeown L. Gralnick H.R. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1244-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as collagen-induced platelet aggregation (7Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1643-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using the Cre/loxP technology, we ablated the β1 gene in megakaryocytes and showed that α2β1 integrin is not required for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on fibrillar collagen under static as well as low and high shear flow conditions. β1-null platelets display a delayed but not reduced aggregation in response to collagen, demonstrating that α2β1 integrin is not a major signaling collagen receptor on platelets (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W.M. Zirngibl H. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The investigations with convulxin provide another example in which antibody inhibition and gene deletion studies showed conflicting results. Whereas the action of convulxin can be inhibited with some antibodies against α2β1 (28Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), Cre/loxP-mediated ablation of β1 integrin on platelets revealed no detectable role of α2β1 for platelet activation by this agonist (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W.M. Zirngibl H. Fässler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Together, these findings strongly suggest that certain antibodies against α2β1 integrin induce inhibitory effects that are not based on blockage of the integrin. Therefore, treatment of platelets with anti-α2β1 antibodies may not be suitable for determining dependence on α2β1 integrin. Another striking difference between rhodocytin- and collagen-mediated platelet aggregation is the central role of GPVI for collagen but not for rhodocytin. We showed recently that GPVI is the major collagen receptor for platelet activation and that GPVI is essential for collagen-induced platelet aggregation (16Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Gachet C. Zirngibl H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Therefore, GPVI-independent aggregation processes are different from collagen-induced aggregation. Both FcRγ-null platelets, which lack GPVI (11Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Rackebrandt K.

Consequently, these platelets neither adhere to collagen nor do they bind adhesive ligands or aggregate in response to this agonist (4Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D.

From these data, we conclude that rhodocytin activates platelets by mechanisms that are different from those induced by collagen. Navdaev and co-workers (9Navdaev A. Clemetson J.M. Polgar J.

The importance of GPIbα for rhodocytin-induced aggregation was concluded from a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of a mAb directed against the thrombin-binding site on GPIbα, which is located in the 45-kDa N-terminal region of the receptor (29Jandrot-Perrus M. Bouton M.C. Lanza F. Guillin M.C. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1996; 22: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This finding was in contrast to observations made by other investigators who found no role of GPIb in rhodocytin-induced activation (30Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Huang T.F. Liu C.Z. Yang S.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or no binding of rhodocytin to GPIb (7Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1643-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The discrepancies in the binding studies are difficult to explain. They may be related to different experimental conditions used in these studies. In our present study we show that platelets lacking the 45-kDa N-terminal domain on GPIbα respond normally to rhodocytin (Fig. 5). This finding excludes an essential role for the ligand-binding region of GPIbα in the rhodocytin-induced activation process and is in clear contrast to the finding by Navdaev and co-workers (9Navdaev A. Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Kehrel B.E. Glauner M. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20882-20889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Steric hindrance or elicitation of inhibitory signals by the GPIbα-specific antibody could be an explanation for the conflicting results. It is known that occupancy of GPIbα induces tyrosine phosphorylation of different signaling molecules in vitro (32Kroll M.H. Harris T.S. Moake J.L. Handin R.I. Schafer A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 33Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol.

Rackebrandt K. Schroder W. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Blood. 2000; 95: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cadroy Y. Hanson S.R. Kelly A.B. Marzec U.M. Evatt B.L. Kunicki T.J. Montgomery R.R.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our results do not exclude the possibility that rhodocytin interacts with an epitope on the GPIb-V-IX complex that is distinct from the 45-kDa N-terminal region of GPIbα. However, in studies using mAbs against different epitopes on either GPIX, GPV, or GPIbα/β, we were unable to alter rhodocytin-induced activation/aggregation. In addition, GPV-deficient mouse platelets respond normally to rhodocytin (not shown). These results suggest that the GPIb-V-IX complex has no essential role in rhodocytin-induced platelet activation. Using genetic ablation of α2β1, antibody-mediated depletion of GPVI, and proteolytic digestion of GPIb, we show that platelets lacking all three major receptors that directly or indirectly interact with collagen (α2β1, GPVI, and GPIb) respond normally to rhodocytin. Because rhodocytin-induced aggregation of human and mouse platelets occurs with a dose-dependent lag time and independently of the FcRγ chain and both processes are sensitive to acetylsalicylic acid, it is unlikely that species-specific differences explain the contrasting results presented here and in other studies (7Suzuki-Inoue K.

Therefore, it appears that receptor(s) other than α2β1, GPVI, and GPIb mediate rhodocytin-induced platelet activation. Rhodocytin induced marked degranulation, suggesting that it stimulates signaling pathways normally used by strong platelet agonists (e.g. thrombin). Alternatively, the strong effects of rhodocytin could be explained by the synergism between two or more platelet receptors. Such synergistic effects have previously been shown for a variety of agonists that stimulate different G-protein-coupled receptors (39Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both ran on SDS gels as a single 140-kDa band in the presence of reducing agent and showed strong verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of added lipid. The wild type showed spontaneous formation of higher molecular mass species in the absence of reducing agent, and its ATPase was activated by dithiothreitol. Oxidation with Cu2+ generated the same higher molecular mass species, primarily at 200 and ∼300 kDa, in high yield. Cross-linking was reversed by dithiothreitol and prevented by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide. Using proteins containing different combinations of naturally occurring Cys residues, it was demonstrated that an inhibitory intramolecular disulfide bond forms between Cys-431 and Cys-1074 (located in the Walker A sequences of nucleotide-binding sites 1 and 2, respectively), giving rise to the 200-kDa species. In addition, dimeric P-glycoprotein species (∼300 kDa) form by intermolecular disulfide bonding between Cys-431 and Cys-1074. The ready formation of the intramolecular disulfide between Cys-431 and Cys-1074 establishes that the two nucleotide-binding sites of P-glycoprotein are structurally very close and capable of intimate functional interaction, consistent with available information on the catalytic mechanism. Formation of such a disulfide in vivo could, in principle, underlie a regulatory mechanism and might provide a means of intervention to inhibit P-glycoprotein.

Understanding the structure and mechanism of action of Pgp in detail is fundamental to devising ways to circumvent multidrug resistance in human cells, and this is an important goal not only because of its application to cancer and AIDS therapies, but also through its relevance to discovery of efficacious new drugs in general. ATP hydrolysis in hamster or human Pgp is strongly inhibited by covalent reaction of either of two Cys residues with NEM (21Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.U. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

These were the only Cys residues apparently exposed for reaction out of seven total Cys residues in hamster or human Pgp. None of the Cys residues in human MDR1 Pgp are essential because a Cys-less construct in which all Cys were changed to Ala retains drug-stimulated ATPase and drug transport activities (22Loo T.W.

Purified mouse MDR3 Pgp showed considerable activation of ATPase (5–8-fold) upon preincubation with DTT, and we attributed this effect to cleavage of an inhibitory disulfide bond present in purified Pgp. As discussed previously (25Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), this finding is of interest because it could be part of a physiological regulatory mechanism involving disulfide bond formation, similar to that believed to operate in vacuolar ATPases (26Forgac M.

Therefore, it was important to establish whether the same inhibitory effects of disulfide cross-linking were seen in the human protein. As we noted earlier (25Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K.

Therefore, determination of the exact location could also shed light on the mode of interaction of the two nucleotide-binding sites. In a series of studies, we (14Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S.

The first goal of this study was to devise a method for expression and purification of large amounts of pure human wild-type and Cys-less MDR1 Pgp using P. pastoris, for this work and future biochemical, biophysical, and high resolution structural analysis. The second goal was to determine whether inhibitory disulfide cross-linking occurs in human wild-type Pgp, to establish the location of the inhibitory disulfide bond(s), and to draw conclusions regarding the structural juxtaposition of the two nucleotide-binding sites. Human wild-type MDR1 cDNA was excised from pVTMDR (29Goodfellow H.R. Sardini A. Ruetz S. Callaghan R. Gros P. McNaughton P.A. Higgins F.C. J. Biol.

Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA1999: 2Google Scholar) cut with EcoRI and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase to create pHIL-hMDR1. Initial tests showed that expression of Pgp, after transformation of this construct into P. pastoris, was low. Therefore, the 5′-end was modified to improve expression by introducing the sequence AAAAAA immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon and removal of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences (31Hinnebusch A.G. Liebman S.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics. I.

The forward oligonucleotide was 5′-CCGCGGAAAAAAATGGATCTAGAAGGGGACCGC-3′, which introduces aSacII site at bp 413 and an XbaI site at bp 430. The reverse oligonucleotide was 5′-CAGCTGACAGTCCAAGAAC-3′. The amplified fragment was cut with SacII (bp 413) andDraI (bp 473) and introduced into the corresponding sites of pBhMDR1, creating pBhMDR1-6A. This removed all 5′-untranslated sequence. A similar strategy was applied to remove the 3′-untranslated sequences. The forward oligonucleotide was 5′-GATACAGAAAGTGAA-3′, and the reverse oligonucleotide was 5′-CTCGAGTCA(GTGATG)5TACGTACTGGCGCTTTGTTCC-3′, which added a SnaBI site after the C-terminal amino acid (bp 4265) and introduced a 10-His tag, a termination codon, and an XhoI site (position 4298). The amplified polymerase chain reaction product was cut with BsmI and XhoI and introduced into the corresponding sites of pBhMDR1-6A to create pBhMDR1-6A10His. The entire polymerase chain reaction fragments inserted were sequenced to check that no errors had been introduced. pBhMDR1-6A10His was then cut with XhoI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, ligated to a “linker” GAATTAATT to preserve the XhoI site, cut withSacI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into pHIL-D2 cut with EcoRI and blunt-ended with S1 nuclease. Correct orientation was confirmed by restriction digestion, and the 5′- and 3′-ends were confirmed by sequencing using pHIL-D2 primers (30Invitrogen Pichia Expression Kit Version J Instruction Manual. Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA1999: 2Google Scholar). This construct was termed pHIL-hMDR1-6A10His. After transformation of this construct into P. pastoris, excellent expression of human MDR1 protein was seen. To facilitate future mutagenesis studies, further silent mutations were made to introduce restriction enzyme sites SpeI (bp 1694 and 2294) and BamHI (bp 3632). For this, standard M13 mutagenesis procedures were followed. The final construct, named pHIL-MDR1.4-His10, gave excellent expression of human MDR1 Pgp in P. pastoris. A clone of human Cys-less MDR1 cDNA in pBluescript was a kind gift of Dr. David Clarke (University of Toronto) (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This construct contains mutations of all seven natural Cys residues to Ala. Full-length MDR1 DNA including ∼71 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and ∼120 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence was excised from this clone with EcoRI and XhoI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into pHIL-D2 cut withEcoRI and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, creating pHIL-hMDR1-CL. This plasmid is analogous to pHIL-hMDR1 (see above). Subsequent manipulations to improve expression were performed as described above for pHIL-hMDR1 to generate pHIL-hMDR1-CL6AHis10. In addition, further silent mutagenesis was carried out using the Altered Sites II system (Promega) to insert the following restriction sites, intended for use in future studies: EcoRI (bp 1601; a natural site that was previously removed (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)), SpeI (bp 1694 and 2294), SmaI (bp 2048), AflII (bp 3215),BamHI (bp 3632), AvrII (bp 3759), andSfiI (bp 4025). The entire segment modified was sequenced to ascertain the presence of the Cys-to-Ala mutations, the presence of all restriction sites, and the absence of any undesired mutations. The final construct was contained in plasmid pHIL-CL1.9-His10, which gave excellent expression of human Cys-less MDR1 protein in P. pastoris. Plasmid pHIL-CL3C was constructed by moving a 633-bpBamHI-SnaBI fragment (positions 3632–4265) from pHIL-MDR1.4-His10 into pHIL-CL1.9-His10. Confirmation of the correct construct was shown by the presence of the PstI site (position 3797), diagnostic for Cys-1125, and the absence of aHhaI site (position 3644), diagnostic for Cys-1074. Plasmid pHIL-CL4C was constructed by moving a 600-bpSpeI-SpeI fragment (positions 1694–2294) from pHIL-MDR1.4-His10 into pHIL-CL3C. Confirmation of the correct construct was shown by the absence of a HhaI site (position 1715), diagnostic for Cys-431. For purification of Pgp containing the single Cys-431 residue, a plasmid was constructed by moving a 600-bpSpeI-SpeI fragment (positions 1694–2294) from pHIL-MDR1.4-His10 into pHIL-CL1.9-His10 to create pHIL-C431. A plasmid for Pgp containing the single Cys-1074 residue was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites II kit. The template consisted of a KpnI-KpnI fragment (base pairs 3199–4313) of pB-CL1.9 (analogous to pBhMDR1-6A10His above) ligated into pALTER-1 to create template pALT-CL-C. In addition to its Cys-to-Ala mutations, pALT-CL-C contains engineered AflII (base 3215), BamHI (base 3632), AvrII (base 3759), and SfiI (base 4025) sites. The mutagenic oligonucleotide was GGATCCAGTGGCTGTGGGAAGAGCAC, where the underlined bases indicated replacement of Ala (GCT) with Cys (TGT) and the destruction of a HhaI site. The mutation was transferred to pHIL-CL1.9 on an AflII-AvrII fragment after sequencing to verify the presence of Cys-1074 and the absence of undesired mutations. The new plasmid was checked by digestion withHhaI and was named pHIL-C1074. A plasmid for Pgp containing both Cys-431 and Cys-1074 was constructed by moving theAflII-AvrII fragment from pHIL-C1074 into pHIL-C431. All pHIL plasmids were checked by digestion with a combination of SacII, SpeI, SnaBI, andNgoMI to ensure that the overall size was correct. Pgp proteins encoded by the pHIL plasmids constructed above were expressed in P. pastoris as described (20Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P.

After application of the n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-solubilized supernatant to the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column and washing with buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, Pgp was eluted with buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The eluate was then diluted with 3 volumes of buffer B (25Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, Pgp was incubated with 8 mmDTT and either 1% (w/v) Escherichia coli lipids (acetone/ether preparation; final lipid/protein ratio = 100:1; Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) or 1% (w/v) “lipid mixture” consisting of 60% E. coli lipids, 17.5% phosphatidylcholine, 10% phosphatidylserine, and 12.5% cholesterol (34Ambudkar S.V.

Assays of ATPase activity, including K m values and vanadate inhibition, were as described (33Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Pgp (60 µg) was incubated with 150 mm DTT for 20 min at 20 °C and then passed through a centrifuge column in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.001%n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. 5-µg samples were incubated with or without 1 mm Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA (40 mm). All samples were then incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C either with or without 100 mm DTT. Samples were depolymerized for SDS gel electrophoresis as described below, except DTT was omitted. For modifications to this procedure, see the legends to the figures and tables. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method in the presence of 1% SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done using the Mini-PROTEAN II Gel and Electrotransfer system (Bio-Rad). Samples (2 volumes) were dissolved in 1 volume of 5% (w/v) SDS, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.125 mTris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.01% pyronin Y, and 160 mm DTT for 20 min at 37 °C and then run on 10% polyacrylamide gels. For immunodetection of Pgp, mouse monoclonal antibody C219 (Signet Laboratories, Inc.) was used with the 3,3′,5,5′-tetra methylbenzidine substrate detection system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.). Centrifuge column elution of Pgp was as described (33Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Other chemicals were as described (25Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that mouse MDR3 Pgp can be expressed in P. pastoris (37Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and purified in far higher amount than from any other system (25Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For expression of human MDR1 Pgp in P. pastoris, humanMDR1 cDNA was modified and incorporated into plasmid pHIL-D2 (30Invitrogen Pichia Expression Kit Version J Instruction Manual. Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA1999: 2Google Scholar). Details of these manipulations are given under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1(lane 1) shows that expression of human Pgp from the initial construct (pHIL-hMDR1) was poor. After introduction of 5′-AAAAAA, removal of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences, and addition of the C-terminal His tag, expression of human MDR1 Pgp was much improved (lane 2). Addition of restriction sites did not affect the level of expression (lane 3). For purification of human MDR1 Pgp, cells were grown in flask culture with methanol induction (see “Experimental Procedures”). The method for purification followed in general that previously used for mouse MDR3 Pgp (25Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

The final MDR1 Pgp protein showed a single band on SDS gels in the presence of reducing agent at 140 kDa, showing that it is deficient in normal glycosylation; the yield of pure soluble protein was 0.03 mg/g of cells (wet weight) (mean of six experiments). Thus, from 6 liters of cells, ∼4.5 mg of pure protein were routinely obtained. For comparison, the yield of mouse MDR3 Pgp under the same conditions was 7.5 mg from 6 liters of cells. Human Cys-less Pgp, in which all seven natural Cys residues were mutated to Ala, was previously constructed, expressed, and purified on small scale (∼10 µg of purified protein) (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we modified this construct to enhance expression in P. pastoris. A series of nine new restriction sites was also inserted to facilitate future mutagenesis experiments. The final cDNA construct (pHIL-CL1.9-His10) was found to be expressed to the same level as wild-type MDR1 in P. pastoris (Fig. 1, lane 4), and the yield of purified soluble Cys-less protein was the same as for wild-type MDR1 Pgp (see above). An SDS gel of the pure protein showed a single 140-kDa band in the presence or absence of reducing agent. We showed previously that the ATPase activity of detergent-soluble pure mouse MDR3 Pgp obtained after expression inP. pastoris was significantly activated by both DTT and lipid (25Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This was found here to be the case with human wild-type MDR1 Pgp. The degree of activation by DTT was 2–3-fold, which is less than that seen with mouse MDR3 Pgp (5–8-fold), but still significant. With human Cys-less Pgp, activation was seen with lipid, but DTT had no effect. Two kinds of lipid were used, namely E. coli lipids or a lipid mixture designed to approximately mimic mammalian plasma membrane lipids (34Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O.

Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and they gave similar results. (Other lipids, e.g. asolectin, also gave similar data.) TableI summarizes the catalytic properties of the activated human wild-type and Cys-less MDR1 proteins. The specific ATPase activities of wild-type and Cys-less Pgp were similar to those previously reported (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), with Cys-less Pgp having ∼60% of wild-type activity. Inclusion of lipids at 0.1 or 0.2% (w/v) in solubilization and chromatography buffers during purification had no effect on final specific ATPase activities. There was low “basal” activity in the absence of drug (Table I), which was greatly accelerated by ver"

By using mutants of the IGF-IR, we showed that one of the pathways depends on residues of the IGF-IR (serines 1280–1283) that interact with 14.3.3 proteins. The result is the activation of Raf-1 and the mitochondrial translocation of both Raf-1 and Nedd4, a target of caspases. A mutant IGF-IR in which the serines at positions 1280–1283 have been mutated to alanine does not protect from apoptosis and fails to translocate Nedd4 or Raf-1 to the mitochondria.

The protective effect of the IGF-IR against cell death has been confirmed by the finding that down-regulation of the IGF-IR, either by antisense strategies or by dominant negative mutants, causes massive apoptosis of cells (2Blakesley V.A.

The main pathway originates with the interaction of the IGF-IR with one of its major substrates, IRS-1 (4White M.F. Mol. Cell.

Although it is clear that this pathway is the main pathway by which the IGF-IR exerts its anti-apoptotic effect, there is substantial evidence that the IGF-IR has alternative pathways.

Since IRS-1 is a powerful mitogen and survival signal that can overwhelm other signals originating from the IGF-IR (23Dews M. Prisco M. Peruzzi F. Romano G. Morrione A. Baserga R.

We have taken advantage of the 32D cell characteristics to investigate further the serine 1280–1283 pathway in IGF-I-mediated survival. As mentioned above, serine 1283 has been identified as a binding site for 14.3.3 (17Craparo A. Freund R. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11663-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), serine 1272 of the IGF-IR also interacts with 14.3.3 proteins. We therefore expected that a serine to alanine mutation in this last serine and/or in serine 1278 would result in an IGF-IR even more defective in its anti-apoptotic signaling. Paradoxically, a double mutation at serines 1272 and 1278 completely reversed the negative effect of the mutations at 1280–1283. The resulting receptor was as good and, perhaps, even marginally better than the wild type receptor in protecting 32D cells from apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal (see below). We have used this contradiction to analyze in more detail the 3rd anti-apoptotic pathway of the IGF-IR. Specifically, we have asked how Raf activation modulates the survival signal of the IGF-IR in 32D cells. Our results show that survival of 32D-derived cells in IGF-I correlates with the mitochondrial translocation of both Raf-1 and Nedd4. Nedd4 is a multifunctional protein that is also a target of caspases (33Harvey K.F. Harvey N.L. Michael J.M. Parasivam G. Waterhouse N. Alnemri E.S. Watters D. Kumar S. J. Biol.

This report implicates Nedd4 for the first time as a component in the anti-apoptotic signaling of the IGF-IR. The wild type IGF-IR and its mutants (4 serine and 6 serine mutants) are described by Romano et al. (26Romano G. Prisco M. Zanocco-Marani T. Peruzzi F. Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Cell.

Additional mutants of the IGF-IR on serines 1272 and 1278 and on single serines at 1280–1283 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Quikchange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. pMSCV-IRS-1 plasmid was described by Valentinis et al.

Mixed populations were selected in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mml-glutamine, 10% conditioned medium from the murine myelomonocytic cell line WEHI-3B as source of IL-3 (10Peruzzi F.

Exponentially growing cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and seeded (5 × 104/35-mm plate in 2 ml of medium) in RPMI 1640 supplemented only with 10% FBS; RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% WEHI cell-conditioned medium as source of IL-3; RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 ng/ml IGF-I (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell numbers were determined in duplicate after 24 and 48 h, counting only the cells able to exclude trypan blue. For an estimate of the extent of differentiation, we followed the procedure of Valentinis et al. (25Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The levels of IGF-IR were monitored by Western blot, as described previously (10Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) using an antibody to the β-subunit of the IGF-IR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The detection of IRS-1 in 32D/4 serine/IRS-1 cells was carried out following the same procedure except that the cells were lysed directly in Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad). The antibody against IRS-1 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Cells exponentially growing were washed five times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and seeded (7 × 106) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% ΔFBS only, supplemented with 10% ΔFBS and 10% IL-3 (WEHI cell-conditioned medium), or with 10% ΔFBS and 50 ng/ml IGF-I. The protocol used to isolate mitochondria was a modification of those described by Bourgeron et al. (35Bourgeron T. Chretien D. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Peruzzi et al. (10Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 35 h, washed three times with 10 ml of buffer A (20 mm MOPS, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mmsucrose), and resuspended in 400 µl of buffer B (buffer A plus 10 mm triethanolamine, 5% Percoll, 0.1 mg/ml digitonin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). After homogenization (25 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer B pestle), samples were centrifuged two times (at 2,500 × g for 5 min) to remove the nuclei and centrifuged again at 13,000 × gfor 10 min to obtain the heavy membrane pellet. This fraction was resuspended in buffer B and centrifuged again at 13,000 for 10 min. Finally the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min and measured for protein contents. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots were performed as described above. The membrane was probed with Raf-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The membrane was subsequently stripped and probed with a cytochrome oxidase subunit IV antibody (Molecular Probes) or with a Nedd4 antibody from Transduction Laboratories (36Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have also used a 2nd procedure for the purification of the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (37Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The two procedures gave essentially the same results. The actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the cytochrome c antibody was from PharMingen. Cells exponentially growing were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and seeded in serum-free medium. After 4 h cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml IGF-I for the indicated times. Cells were collected and lysed as described above. 30 µg of the whole cell lysates were resolved in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Phosphorylated Raf-1 was detected using an anti-phospho-Raf-1 (S338) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Total Raf-1 was determined using an anti-Raf antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In Western blots, statistical significance between two measurements was determined by the two-tailed Student's ttest analysis of variance. The cell lines derived from parental 32D cells (32D) are designated as follows: 32D IGF-IR (expressing a wild type IGF-IR), 32D 4Ser (IGF-IR with serine to alanine mutations at positions 1280–1283), 32D 6Ser (receptor with mutations at serines to alanine 1272, 1278, and 1280–1283), and 32D 2Ser (receptor with mutations at serines 1272 and 1278). In the absence of IL-3, 32D cells rapidly die. The mode of death is apoptosis, which has been repeatedly documented in previous papers from this and other laboratories (23Dews M. Prisco M. Peruzzi F. Romano G. Morrione A. Baserga R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B.

Under these conditions, 32D IGF-IR cells grow exponentially for 48 h (23Dews M. Prisco M. Peruzzi F. Romano G. Morrione A. Baserga R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After 48 h, 32D IGF-IR cells stop growing and begin to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway (25Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A.

Fig. 1 compares survival and growth of four cell lines as follows: 32D IGF-IR, 32D 4Ser, 32D 6Ser, and 32D 2Ser cells. All cell lines express the IGF-IR, either wild type (32D IGF-IR), or the indicated mutants (Fig. 1, panel C). After IL-3 withdrawal, and in the absence of IGF-I, all these cell lines rapidly undergo apoptosis. In the presence of IGF-I, they survive and actually grow for at least 48 h, with one exception. The exception is the 32D 4Ser cell line, which survives for 24 h (panel A) and then rapidly dies (panel B), as already reported (10Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, additional mutations at serines 1272 and 1278 (6-serine mutant receptor) completely restore the ability of the IGF-IR to protect 32D cells from apoptosis. We have repeated this experiment many times, and also with another mixed population, but the 6-serine mutant always protected 32D cells from apoptosis. Indeed, the 6-serine mutant always gave a marginally but reproducibly better survival signal than the wild type receptor (Fig. 1). This was also noticed in mouse embryo fibroblasts undergoing anoikis (26Romano G. Prisco M. Zanocco-Marani T. Peruzzi F. Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 294-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A mutation limited to serines 1272/1278 resulted in a receptor indistinguishable from the wild type receptor (Fig. 1). In a previous paper (10Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), we had shown that the wild type IGF-IR activated Raf-1, causing its translocation to the mitochondria, where it can exert an antiapoptotic effect (19Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 20Salomoni P. Wasik M.A. Riedel R.F. Reiss K. Choi J.K. Skorski T. Calabretta B. J.

Cell. 1996; 87: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), through the inactivation of BAD (see Introduction). The 4-serine mutant failed to cause mitochondrial translocation of Raf-1, and its phenotype was rescued by the ectopic expression of a mutant Raf that localizes to the mitochondria (20Salomoni P. Wasik M.A. Riedel R.F. Reiss K. Choi J.K. Skorski T. Calabretta B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1995-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, we confirm that, in medium supplemented with IGF-I, the wild type receptor (2nd lane), but not the 4-serine mutant (4th lane), causes Raf-1 translocation to the mitochondria. The 6-serine mutant, like the wild type receptor, induces translocation of Raf-1 to the mitochondria (4th lane). Raf-1 levels in mitochondria are constantly elevated in all cell lines if the cells are growing in IL-3 (1st, 3rd, and5th lanes). The amounts of cytochrome oxidase (COX IV) in the lysates were used to monitor the amounts of mitochondrial proteins in each lane. Grb10 is an adaptor protein that interacts with the IGF-IR (41Morrione A. Valentinis B. Li S. Ooui J.Y.T. Margolis B. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3165-3167PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dey B.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Grb10 also interacts with Raf-1, and their interaction is accompanied by an anti-apoptotic signal (44Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As mentioned in the Introduction, Raf-1 and Grb10 can be co-immunoprecipitated from mitochondrial fractions (21Nantel A. Huber M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35719-35724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We could not detect Grb10 in our 32D cells. However, Grb10 is known to interact with Nedd4, both by the yeast two-hybrid system and by co-immunoprecipitation in lysates of mouse embryo fibroblasts (36Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the presence of Nedd4 in the mitochondria of the same three cell lines, after IL-3 withdrawal and supplementation with IGF-I (Fig. 2). Nedd4 is present in the mitochondrial fraction of 32D cells expressing the wild type IGF-IR and the 6-serine mutant. Nedd4 was not detectable in the mitochondrial fraction of 32D 4Ser cells in IGF-I, although it was present in the same cells growing in IL-3. Fig. 2 shows a representative experiment, but these experiments have been repeated several times and were reproducible, even when different techniques for the purification of mitochondria were used. Serines 1272 and 1283 interact with 14.3.3 proteins (17Craparo A. Freund R. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

We have used antibodies to specific serines of Raf-1 to detect its activation in the lysates from various cell lines, after stimulation with IGF-I. We could not observe any difference among the various cell lines in the extent of phosphorylation of serine 621 or serine 259 (not shown). There were instead clear and reproducible differences in the phosphorylation of serine 338 after stimulation with IGF-I (Fig.3). Phosphorylation of serine 338 was detectable in the cell lines that survived after IL-3 removal (32D I"
https://openalex.org/W2120872807,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is induced in human T lymphocytes upon T cell receptor triggering. Here we report that Cot kinase, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase involved in T cell activation, up-regulates COX-2 gene expression in Jurkat T cells. Induction of COX-2 promoter activity by Cot kinase occurred mainly through activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Mutation of the distal (−105/−97) and proximal (−76/−61) NFAT response elements in the COX-2 promoter abolished the activation induced by Cot kinase. Even more, coexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT inhibited Cot kinase-mediated COX-2 promoter activation, whereas cotransfection of a constitutively active version of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin synergizes with Cot kinase in the up-regulation of COX-2 promoter-driven transcription. Strikingly, Cot kinase increased transactivation mediated by a GAL4-NFAT fusion protein containing the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFATp. In contrast to phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore A23187, Cot kinase increases both COX-2 promoter activity and NFAT-mediated transactivation in a cyclosporin A-independent manner. These data indicate that Cot kinase up-regulates COX-2 promoter-driven transcription through the NFAT response elements, being the Cot kinase-induced NFAT-dependent transactivation presumably implicated in this up-regulation.

Even more, coexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT inhibited Cot kinase-mediated COX-2 promoter activation, whereas cotransfection of a constitutively active version of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin synergizes with Cot kinase in the up-regulation of COX-2 promoter-driven transcription. Strikingly, Cot kinase increased transactivation mediated by a GAL4-NFAT fusion protein containing the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFATp. In contrast to phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore A23187, Cot kinase increases both COX-2 promoter activity and NFAT-mediated transactivation in a cyclosporin A-independent manner. These data indicate that Cot kinase up-regulates COX-2 promoter-driven transcription through the NFAT response elements, being the Cot kinase-induced NFAT-dependent transactivation presumably implicated in this up-regulation. activator protein 1 nuclear factor of activated T cells nuclear factor κB cyclooxygenase cytomegalovirus wild type dominant negative polymerase chain reaction 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate cyclosporin A relative light unit Cot/Tpl-2 kinase has been implicated in cellular activation and transformation (1Salmerón A.

DeWitt D.L. Garavito M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme thought to be involved in “housekeeping” functions. In contrast, COX-2 is induced in a variety of cell types by diverse stimuli including growth factors, mitogens, cytokines, and tumor promoters (19Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). COX-2 is induced in T lymphocytes upon T cell receptor activation, suggesting functional implications of this enzyme in this process (20Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J.

Upon T cell activation, it becomes dephosphorylated by calcium/calcineurin phosphatase and translocates into the nucleus (for review, see Ref. 35Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). Stimulation of T cells by phorbol esters and calcium ionophore A23187 regulates not only the nuclear localization of NFAT, but also its transactivation activity (35Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Regulation of COX-2 expression by Cot kinase occurs mainly through activation of NFAT. Both distal and proximal NFAT response elements in the COX-2 promoter are essential for Cot kinase-mediated induction. We also provide evidence that neither NF-κB nor c-Jun is involved in this activation. Finally, we have determined that Cot kinase increases transactivation mediated by the N-terminal domain of NFAT. Involvement of Cot kinase-induced NFAT transactivation in the COX-2 promoter activation is discussed further.DISCUSSIONCOX-2 has been implicated in inflammation processes and is the target of many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (19Smith W.L.

We have previously described that COX-2 is induced upon antigenic triggering in resting T cells, where it plays a role in controlling the process of T cell activation (20Iñiguez M.A. Punzón C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119PubMed Google Scholar, 21Iñiguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzón C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol.

In this report we have found that Cot kinase is involved in the regulation of COX-2 transcription in T cells. The fact that a kinase-deficient mutant of Cot kinase blocked the activation of COX-2 promoter induced by α-CD3 and α-CD28, as well as by phorbol esters plus calcium ionophore, indicates that Cot kinase or a Cot-like kinase plays a pivotal role in the up-regulation of COX-2 gene expression upon T cell activation. Cot kinase regulates the activity of several transcription factors induced in T cell activation such as NFAT, AP-1, or NF-kB (10Chiarello M. Marinsen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell.

Patriotis C. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1998; 19: 2609-2618Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar); Cot kinase also up-regulates the AP-1 response element of the collagenase promoter (12Hagemann D. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1391-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Ballester A. Velasco A. Tobeña R. Alemany S. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1998; 19: 2609-2618Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been shown that COX-2 promoter contains binding sites for these transcription factors, acting as positive regulatory elements of COX-2 transcription in several cell types (22–34). However, we have shown here that activation of COX-2 promoter in T cells occurs in a NF-kB-independent manner, in agreement with previous results discarding a role of this transcription factor in this cell type. On the other hand, a dominant negative mutant of c-Jun inhibits PDBu plus calcium ionophore activation of COX-2 promoter, pointing to an important role of those signaling pathways leading to AP-1 activation (21Iñiguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzón C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, this mutant did not affect Cot kinase-mediated induction of Cox-2 promoter, suggesting that Cot could act through a c-Jun-independent pathway to activate this promoter.Data obtained with the COX-2 promoter deletion constructs or with those with distal and proximal NFAT sites mutated, as well as the overexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT, indicate that NFAT is required for Cot-mediated or PDBu plus calcium ionophore up-regulation of COX-2 promoter. The striking synergism between wtNFAT or ΔCAM-AI and Cot kinase and the fact that CsA did not inhibit Cot kinase-mediated Cox-2 promoter induction supports the hypothesis that Cot kinase-induced NFAT-dependent transactivation is either downstream of calcineurin, or it represents a parallel pathway (Fig.9). Here, we show that Cot kinase mediated up-regulation of genes transactivated by NFAT occurs through the increase in the transactivation function of NFAT. The Cot kinase induced-transactivation by NFAT described here can explain why Cot kinase up-regulates COX-2 promoter activity through their NFAT sites in addition to NFAT binding to these sites. Moreover, the up-regulation of transactivation by NFAT and the induction of COX-2 promoter-driven transcription by Cot kinase are both CsA-independent and could also explain the reported CsA-insensitive activation of interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor-α gene by Cot kinase in T cells (15Tsatsanis C.

Tsatsanis et al. (15Tsatsanis C. Patriotis C. Bear S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3827-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have reported the regulation of NFAT by Cot kinase at the level of subcellular localization. Thus, they have shown that overexpression of Cot kinase induces the nuclear accumulation of HA-NFATc in the 3T3 fibroblasts. An integration of signal promoted by phorbol esters and calcium ionophore is required to increase the transactivation by NFAT (35Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar, 36Garcia-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 44Avots A.

However, PDBu plus calcium ionophore activation of the NFAT transactivation domain is CsA-sensitive (35, 36, and this report) in contrast to what we observed with Cot kinase. In this context, it remains to be established whether the reported accumulation of NFATc by Cot kinase in the nucleus (15Tsatsanis C. Patriotis C. Bear S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3827-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is a consequence of the increase of transactivation function of NFAT triggered by Cot kinase which thereby retained it in the nucleus. Another possibility is that Cot kinase regulates both the NFAT in/out shuttling of the nucleus and transactivation by NFAT by different ways, but with a common finality, to induce promoter transcription through NFAT response elements.In conclusion, the data shown here indicate that Cot kinase controls COX-2 promoter activity mainly, if not exclusively, through the NFAT response elements. We also provide evidence of a new mechanism of NFAT transcription factor activity up-regulation by Cot kinase which helps to explain the important role of this kinase in the regulation of gene expression after T cell activation. Further analysis remains to be done to define the interactions between Cot kinase and the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFAT.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however, the GPI transferred to protein bears a fourth, α1,2-linked Man on the α1,2-Man that receives the phosphoethanolamine (EthN-P) moiety through which GPIs become linked to protein. We report that temperature-sensitive smp3 mutants accumulate a GPI containing three mannoses and that smp3 is epistatic to thegpi11, gpi13, and gaa1 mutations, which normally result in the accumulation of Man4-GPIs, including the presumed substrate for the yeast GPI transamidase. The Smp3 protein, which is encoded by an essential gene, is therefore required for addition of the fourth Man to yeast GPI precursors. The finding that smp3 prevents the formation of the Man4-GPI that accumulates when addition of EthN-P to Man-3 is blocked in a gpi13 mutant suggests that the presence of the fourth Man is important for transfer of EthN-P to Man-3 of yeast GPIs. The Man3-GPI that accumulates in smp3 is a mixture of two dominant isoforms, one bearing a single EthN-P side branch on Man-1, the other with EthN-P on Man-2, and these isoforms can be placed in separate arms of a branched GPI assembly pathway. Smp3-related proteins are encoded in the genomes ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans,Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens and form a subgroup of a family of proteins, the other groups of which are defined by the Pig-B(Gpi10) protein, which adds the third GPI mannose, and by the Alg9 and Alg12 proteins, which act in the dolichol pathway for N-glycosylation. Because Man4-containing GPI precursors are normally formed in yeast and Plasmodium falciparum, whereas addition of a fourth Man during assembly of mammalian GPIs is rare and not required for GPI transfer to protein, Smp3p-dependent addition of a fourth Man represents a target for antifungal and antimalarial drugs.

We report that the S. cerevisiae Smp3 protein, a member of a family of potential dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) Man-utilizing mannosyltransferases, is a candidate for the enzyme that adds the fourth Man during yeast GPI assembly. Temperature-sensitivesmp3 mutations prevent the formation of Man4-GPIs and result in the accumulation of Man3-GPIs. Addition of the fourth mannose is therefore required to generate the Man4-GPIs that are the most likely substrates for the yeast GPI transamidase. Because the SMP3gene is essential, and because addition of a fourth Man seems to be of much greater relative importance in GPI assembly in yeast than it is in mammalian cells, addition of the fourth Man represents a potential target for antifungal drugs. [2-3H]myo-Inositol (specific activity, 15–20 Ci/mmol) and [1-3H]ethanolamine (specific activity, 10–30 Ci/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO).

Both primary isolates were back-crossed twice to strain YMW1. The cross of smp3-1to Δgpi1-8H yielded viablesmp3-1/Δgpi1 haploids.

Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and allowing the resulting diploids to sporulate. Asci were dissected, and ascospores were allowed to germinate on YP-galactose medium supplemented with 0.25 m KCl. The genotypes of segregants from tetratype tetrads were determined from the segregation of selectable markers and temperature sensitivity among these strains and confirmed by the thin-layer chromatographic profiles of their [3H]inositol-labeled lipids. Thesmp3/Δgpi13-pGAL-GPI13 double mutants grew more slowly at 25 °C on solid YPGal medium than the single mutants unless osmotic support was provided. smp3/gaa1 double mutants were generated in a genetic cross of the smp3-1 and gaa1-2 strains. Thesmp3/gaa1 segregants from tetratype tetrads were distinguishable from the smp3-1 and gaa1-2 single mutation because, unlike the single mutants, they failed to grow at 37 °C on solid YPD medium supplemented with 0.25 m KCl. The presence of both the smp3 and gaa1 mutations in these strains was confirmed by introducing the SMP3 gene on a plasmid; at nonpermissive temperature, the double mutants showed the profile of [3H]inositol-labeled lipids characteristic of gaa1, not smp3 (see Fig. 2 A). smp3-1 was crossed into an ethanolamine-auxotrophicΔpsd1/Δpsd2 strain background (RYY51) (35Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) to generate a strain capable of enhanced incorporation of exogenous ethanolamine into lipid. Media for growth of thesmp3-1/Δpsd1/Δpsd2strain were supplemented with 2 mm ethanolamine and 2 mm choline. A heterozygous smp3::Kan R/SMP3disruptant, generated by the Saccharomyces Deletion Project, was obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Plasmid pSMP3-426, in which SMP3 is expressed behind its native promoter, was made by using polymerase chain reaction to amplify a genomic DNA fragment containing SMP3 and 401 nucleotides immediately upstream of the start codon and 336 nucleotides immediately downstream of the SMP3 coding region, after which the DNA fragment was cloned into the 2µ plasmid pRS426 (36Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGAL-SMP3, in which expression of SMP3 is under the control of the glucose-repressible GAL10 promoter, was made by using polymerase chain reaction to amplify the SMP3 coding region from genomic DNA and cloning the resulting DNA fragment between the GAL10 promoter and the GAL7 termination region of plasmid pMW20 (34Zieler H.A. Walberg M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pGAL-SMP3. Haploidsmp3::KanR strains complemented by pSMP3-426 or pGAL-SMP3 were generated by introducing these plasmids into thesmp3::Kan R/SMP3 strain, allowing the diploids to sporulate, and recovering kanamycin-resistantsmp3::Kan R-pSMP3-426 or pGAL-SMP3 strains from the tetrads that yielded four viable segregants. Both plasmids therefore expressed functional Smp3p. A gpi10::LEU2/GPI10 diploid was generated by replacing 95% of the GPI10 coding region with the selectable marker LEU2 using the strategy previously used to disrupt the GPI11 gene (22Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1611-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGPI10-426, in which GPI10 is expressed behind its native promoter, was made by using polymerase chain reaction to amplify a genomic DNA fragment containing GPI10, 465 nucleotides immediately upstream of the start codon, and 337 nucleotides immediately downstream of the GPI10 coding region, after which the DNA fragment was cloned into the 2µ plasmid pRS426. This plasmid was introduced intogpi10::LEU2/GPI10 diploids, which were then allowed to sporulate. The resulting asci were dissected, andgpi10::LEU2-pGPI10-426 segregants were recovered from tetrads that gave four viable segregants, indicating that pGPI10-426 expressed functional Gpi10p. For [3H]inositol labeling, logarithmically growing cells were resuspended at 10A 600 units/ml in inositol-free synthetic medium, shifted as appropriate to nonpermissive temperature for 20 min, and then labeled with 15 µCi of [3H]inositol for 90 min. For [3H]inositol labeling of GPIs in thesmp3::Kan R-pGAL-SMP3 strain, cultures were grown in SDGlyYE medium, cells were then resuspended in SDGlcYE medium for 16 h to repress SMP3 expression, and cultures were then pulse-labeled with [3H]inositol for 2 h as detailed in Ref. 22Taron C.H.

In the case of thesmp3/Δgpi13-pGAL-SMP3 strain,GPI13 expression was likewise repressed by incubation in SDGlcYE medium at 25 °C, after which portions of the culture were either maintained at 25 °C or shifted to 37 °C for 20 min before pulse labeling with [3H]inositol (22Taron C.H.

For [3H]ethanolamine labeling, strains were grown in SD medium supplemented with choline and ethanolamine and then washed and radiolabeled with 50 µCi of ethanolamine in SD medium lacking ethanolamine. Radiolabeled lipids were extracted and separated by TLC using chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:2.5 by volume) as solvent (22Taron C.H. Wiedman J.M. Grimme S.J. Orlean P. Mol. Biol.

Two lines of evidence suggested that the Smp3 protein might be a Dol-P-Man-utilizing mannosyltransferase involved in GPI assembly. First, the S. cerevisiae genome encodes several proteins similar to Pig-Bp (19Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A.

Of these, Gpi10p is the functional homolog of Pig-Bp (19Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A.

Jakob C.A. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Aebi M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The SMP3 gene encodes a fourth related protein. The temperature-sensitive smp3-1mutant had previously been isolated in a screen for yeast mutants that stably maintained a heterologous plasmid (33Irie K. Araki H. Oshima Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and its availability allowed us to test it for a defect in GPI anchoring. Genetic evidence implicating Smp3p in GPI anchoring came from the fact that we isolated an allele of SMP3 in a screen for mutants that require theGPI1 gene for growth.2 Gpi1p, which is necessary for growth at 37 °C but not 25 °C, is a subunit of the protein complex that catalyzes the first step in GPI assembly, the formation of GlcNAc-PI (38Leidich S.D. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27829-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 46Watanabe R. Inoue N. Westfall B. Taron C.H. Orlean P. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The premise behind our synthetic lethality screen was that an additional mutation affecting GPI assembly or transfer to protein might be lethal when combined with theΔgpi1 mutation. One temperature-sensitive strain isolated in this way was complemented by a centromeric plasmid (47Gerring S.L. Spencer F. Hieter P. EMBO J. 1990; 13: 4347-4358Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) containing SMP3 that we recovered from a genomic yeast DNA library. We confirmed by integrative transformation that the clonedSMP3 gene was closely linked to the locus conferring temperature sensitivity, and we refer to this mutation assmp3-2. The temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of both thesmp3-1 and smp3-2 alleles was osmotically remediable; inclusion of either 0.25 m KCl or 1m sorbitol in solid medium restored the ability of these strains to grow at 37 °C. Although SMP3 was shown to be an essential gene (33Irie K. Araki H. Oshima Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we tested whether haploid smp3disruptants might be capable of vegetative growth if given osmotic support. Heterozygoussmp3::Kan R/SMP3 diploids were allowed to sporulate, and the resulting asci were dissected onto solid YPD medium or onto YPD medium supplemented with 0.6 m KCl or 1.0 m sorbitol. When ascospores were dissected onto YPD medium, only the two kanamycin-sensitive, wild type segregants gave rise to colonies, whereas the smp3::Kan Rsegregants either failed to germinate or failed to divide. When dissected onto osmotically supported YPD medium, thesmp3::Kan R segregants completed 4–8 rounds of cell division but then ceased further growth. We conclude that Smp3p is essential for vegetative growth. To establish whether smp3 mutants are defective in GPI synthesis, we tested whether they accumulate an intermediate in the GPI synthetic pathway. Accumulation of a precursor provides a more sensitive indication of a GPI assembly defect in late-stage yeast GPI anchoring mutants than testing for defects in GPI transfer to protein can. For example, the gpi10–1 mutant accumulates a Man2-containing GPI precursor but incorporates normal amounts of [3H]inositol into proteins (19Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The smp3-1 and smp3-2 mutants, a wild type strain, and smp3 mutants harboring a centromeric library plasmid containing the SMP3 gene were pulse-labeled with [3H]inositol at 25 and 37 °C, after which labeled lipids were extracted from the cells and separated by TLC. Both strains accumulated a major [3H]inositol-labeled lipid (3-1), as well as a minor, less polar species (3-2), suggesting that they have a defect in GPI synthesis (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Accumulation of lipid 3-1 was highest at 25 °C in the smp3-1 strain, whereas smp3-2accumulated somewhat more at 37 °C. Lipid accumulation by bothsmp3 strains was abolished when the SMP3 gene was introduced into these strains on a centromeric plasmid (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10), strongly suggesting that their GPI synthetic defect is due to a mutation in the SMP3gene. To show that the lipid accumulation phenotype of the temperature-sensitive smp3 mutants can be mimicked by depleting Smp3p in"

Three of these saposins (B, C, and D) share common structural features including a lack of tryptophan, a single glycosylation sequence, the presence of three conserved disulfide bonds, and a common multiamphipathic helical bundle motif. Saposin A contains an additional glycosylation site and a single tryptophan. The oligosaccharides on saposins are not required for in vitro activation functions. Saposins A and C were produced in Escherichia coli to contain single tryptophans at various locations to serve as intrinsic fluorescence reporters,i.e. as topological probes, for interaction with phospholipid membranes. Maximum emission shifts, aqueous and solid quenching, and resonance energy transfer were quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy. Amphipathic helices at the amino- and carboxyl termini of saposins A and C were shown to insert into the lipid bilayer to about five carbon bond lengths. In comparison, the middle region of saposins A or C were either embedded in the bilayer or solvent-exposed, respectively. Conformational changes of saposin C induced by phosphatidylserine interaction suggested the reorientation of functional helical domains. Differential interaction models are proposed for the membrane-bound saposins A and C. By site-directed mutagenesis of saposin A and C, their membrane topological structures were correlated with their activation effects on acid β-glucosidase. These findings show that proper orientation of the middle segment of saposin C to the outside of the membrane surface is critical for its specific and multivalent interaction with acid β-glucosidase. Such membrane interactions and orientations of the saposins determine the proximity of their activation and/or binding sites to lysosomal hydrolases or lipoid substrates.

A multiple α-helical bundle motif, characterized by a three-conserved-disulfide structure and several amphipathic peptides, is found in the saposins and also in saposin-like proteins and domains,i.e. NK-lysin, surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B),1 acid sphingomyelinase, acyloxylacyl hydrolase, plant aspartic proteases and, pore-forming peptides (amoebapores) (for review, see Ref. 16Munford R.S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This common backbone structure was characterized by the NMR structure of NK-lysin (see Fig. 1 A) as well as by the crystal structure of prophytepsin (a plant aspartic protease) (17Liepinsh E. Andersson M. Ruysschaert J.M. Otting G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 18Kervinen J. Tobin G.J. Costa J. Waugh D.S. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The “saposin-fold” is a common fold in a single globular structure for all the saposins and saposin-like proteins and domains. Despite the shared saposin-fold structure in solution, saposins and saposin-like proteins have diverse in vivo biological functions. Since all these proteins bind to or interact with lipid membranes, one can speculate that the specific biological functions of saposins and saposin-like proteins are the results of the differential interactions with the biological membrane environments. For instance, SP-B and NK-lysin are saposin-like proteins with completely different biological functions. SP-B plays a crucial role in the rapid adsorption of lipids at the air/water interface (19Whitsett J.A. Nogee L.M. Weaver T.E. Horowitz A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). NK-lysin is a tumor-lysin and antibacterial polypeptide (20Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jornvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A postulated model for SP-B action on lipid membranes included a small alteration of the saposin-fold in lipid-bound SP-B, whereas membrane-associated NK-lysin maintains the saposin-fold without any structural changes. In the SP-B-lipid binding model, portions of the hydrophobic helical stretches are buried in the bilayer in an orientation parallel to the lipid acyl chains. Other parts of helices are positioned parallel to the membrane surface (21Vandenbussche G. Clercx A. Clercx M. Curstedt T. Johansson J. Jornvall H. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9169-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The insertion of α-helical peptides and the electrostatic interaction between charged residues of the protein and polar head groups of lipid stabilize SP-B at the lipid membrane surface. Lipid-bound NK-lysin model has half of the molecule embedded into the membrane, and the more hydrophilic negatively charged half remains solvent-exposed (22Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Homble F. Andersson M. Liepinsh E. Otting G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Most of the positively charged residues located in an equatorial belt around the saposin fold of the molecule interact with the negatively charged head groups of the lipid. Apparently, the different interaction modes of SP-B and NK-lysin with lipid membrane are due to the different charge arrangements and amphipathic properties of helices in these two molecules. Prosaposin is a multifunctional precursor preprotein. A complete deficiency of prosaposin with a mutation in the initiation codon caused the storage of multiple glycosphingolipid substrates resembling a combined lysosomal hydrolase deficiency (23Schnabel D. Schroder M. Furst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The structural characteristics of these saposins are of great importance to their diverse mechanisms of activation on their respective cognate glycosphingolipid hydrolases. Mechanistic and kinetic studies of lysosomal enzyme activation by saposins B and C have shown different modes of action. In general, activation by saposin B is via solubilizing and presenting glycosphingolipid substrates to several lysosomal enzymes (2Furst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys.

The enzyme activity is thought to be optimized by saposin C via membrane perturbation (32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the binding of saposin C to phospholipid bilayers is poorly characterized. In vitro andex vivo saposins A and D functions are to enhance the degradation of galactosylceramide and ceramide/sphingomyelin, respectively (12Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A.

Commun. 1988; 156: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To date, the precise physiological functions of saposins A and D remain unknown. In vitro saposin A enhances acid β-glucosidase activity at micromolar concentrations, but isolated saposin C deficiency leads to glucosylceramide storage and a “Gaucher disease-like” phenotype (36Schnabel D. Schroder M. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Rafi M.A. de Gala G. Zhang X.L. Wenger D.A. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, saposin A is probably not an important physiologic activator of acid β-glucosidase (15Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Barca A. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16862-16867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a variety of cells, the physiological concentrations of saposins are estimated to be in the nanomolar range (39Morimoto S. Yamamoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3493-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and saposin C provides excellence in vitro activation levels at 200 nm. This activation was mediated via a highly specific induced conformational change and multivalent interactions. Importantly, negatively charged phospholipid bilayers are required for the interactions of saposin A and/or C with acid β-glucosidase in vitro. Consequently, their mechanisms of interaction may be influenced by their differential interaction. In this study, the differential interactions of saposins A and C with lipid bilayers were evaluated by intrinsic Trp fluorescence spectroscopy. Mutant saposins provided insight into the molecular basis for the conformational requirement of membrane-bound saposins to the specific activation functions. The following materials were from commercial sources: acrylamide (Life Technologies); 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and Ceredase® (alglucerase for injection) (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA); QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); magic polymerase chain reaction prep kits (Promega, Madison, WI); C4 reverse phase HPLC column (Alltech Association Inc., Deerfield, IL); egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), brain phosphatidylserine (BPS), palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(n-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SLPC; n = 5, 10, 16), dansyl (or 5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)-phosphatidylserine (18:1, 1) (DPS) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Anionic lipids were sodium salts. All other reagents were reagent grade or better. The amino acid sequences of wild-type saposins A and C are shown in Fig. 1. The mature NH2-terminal amino acid of the natural human saposins will be designated as 1 and used to reference the position of the amino acids in the fragments. The cDNAs for mutant proteins were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, and their sequences were verified by complete DNA sequencing. All recombinant saposins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells by using the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducing pET system (15Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expressed proteins with a His tag were eluted from nickel columns. After dialysis, the proteins were further purified by HPLC chromatography as follows. The C4 reverse phase column was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min, and then the proteins were eluted in a linear (0–100%) gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile over 60 min. The major protein peak was collected and lyophilized. The protein concentrations were determined as previously described (15Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unilamellar vesicles were prepared by bath sonication (15Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Qi X. Grabowski G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11544-11554Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Phospholipids (0.4–50 µmol) in chloroform were dried under N2 and then vacuum. The lipid films were suspended in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.7, and sonicated in a bath sonicator until clear. The temperature during sonication was kept at least 5 °C above the T c of the lipid mixtures. To prevent overheating the samples, ice was added as needed. Since saposins cause fusion of the vesicles within 2–3 min of introduction, the selected saposins were incubated for about 20–30 min before collection of any fluorescence measurements. The vesicles had ∼200-nm diameters (N4 plus particle sizing). Using 31P NMR spectroscopy in the presence of Mn2+ quenching (40Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), lipid dispersions of egg PC in sodium acetate, pH 4.7, with vortex mixing showed 16–28% 31P quenching by the addition of MnCl2 (5 mm). Since the 31P in PC would be distributed to inaccessible sites within multilamellar liposomes (inner leaflet and internal concentric bilayers), the quenching percentage would be expected to be significantly less than 50%. In comparison, egg PC liposomes prepared by the above sonication procedure led to an ∼50% reduction in 31P signal upon addition of Mn2+. These results are consistent with those expected for unilamellar vesicles. The saposin activities toward acid β-glucosidase were determined fluorometrically (15Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Qi X. Grabowski G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11544-11554Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted in a detergent-free system with phosphatidylserine liposomes. The protein-to-lipid ratios were 1:20 (mole/mole) unless otherwise indicated. The intrinsic fluorescence of proteins is contributed mainly from tryptophan (Trp) residues. Tyr and Phe in the saposins contributed <10% of total fluorescence to the measurements. Singly substituted saposins (Trp) were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired by scanning (300 to 400 nm) in an SLM-Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (Urbana, IL). Excitation wavelength (λEX = 280 nm) and spectral bandwidths (4 nm) were used for the excitation and emission monochromators. Saposins (2 µm) were added to liposome suspensions at protein-to-lipid ratios of 1:20 (mole:mole). Liposomal dispersions had no fluorescence under these conditions. The associations between saposins and phosphatidylserine vesicles were determined by fluorescence-quenching analysis. The aqueous quencher, acrylamide, experiments were conducted for at least 15 min. For estimating the depth of saposin penetration into the liposomal membranes, tryptophan fluorescence quenching was evaluated in the presence of liposomes containing various mole % of spin-labeled SLPC. The individual quenching conditions are described in the figure legends. FRET spectroscopy was conducted with vesicles containing PS with a dansyl-labeled head group (DPS). Donor-reporter pair fluorescence formed in saposin-DPS vesicles was analyzed by FRET. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired from 300 to 550 nm with λEX = 280 nm. The protein:lipid ratios were 1:10 (mole:mole). The inner filter effects, if any, were corrected as follows: F corr = F obsantilog[(A ex +A em)/2]. F corrand F obs are the corrected and observed fluorescence, respectively. A ex andA em are optical densities of the samples at both the excitation and emission wavelengths. The secondary structures of saposins with or without phospholipid vesicles were estimated from the CD spectra and recorded at room temperature from a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) using a 0.1-cm quartz cell. The reaction mixtures were in 0.005 m sodium citrate, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 4.7, to reduce noise at wavelengths below 200 nm. Data acquisition and deconvolution calculations were done as described (31Qi X. Grabowski G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11544-11554Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Qi X. Kondoh K. Krusling D. Kelso G.J. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6284-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The deconvolution programs were from Jasco with reference to an average of seven x-ray structures of known proteins, i.e. myoglobin, lysozyme, papain, ribonuclease, hemoglobin, α-chymotrypsin A, and cytochromec. The calculations provided estimations of secondary structure of saposins as α-helix (% α), β-strand (% β), β-turn (% T), and other structures (% R). The calculations of precise secondary structures may require more reference protein sets or other deconvolution methods. These experiments were conducted to predict relative changes in CD spectra, and the results do not necessarily reflect the exact secondary structures of saposins. The CD spectra of saposins in the absence or presence of phospholipids were acquired under the same conditions. No significant CD spectra were detected from liposome samples under our experimental conditions. To determine the membrane interactions of saposins, fluorescence emission shifts, fluorescence quenching, and FRET were conducted with phospholipid-containing unilamellar vesicles. Individual tryptophans (W) were created by site-directed mutagenesis and were termed saposin (XW) to indicate the position (X) of the tryptophan residue in the mature amino acid sequence of each saposins. For example, wild-type saposin A contains a Trp at residue 37, i.e. saposin A (37W). This Trp was substituted with Phe in saposin As having differently substituted Trp residues. The amino acid sequences of saposins A and C are shown in Fig.1 B. Compared with normal saposin A, saposin C (S37W) was generated by substitution of a Trp for serine(s) at residue 37. Saposins A (0W) or C (0W) had Trps preceding the first NH2-terminal amino acid in the saposin A or C sequences, respectively. Saposins A (81W) or C (81W) had Trps after the last native COOH-terminal amino acid. All Trp-substituted saposins retained their native activation properties. Trp fluorescence emission spectra of proteins were monitored by the change in maximum emission wavelength and intensity since the tryptophan environments change polarity (42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 388Google Scholar). To assess the polarity shifts, the fluorescence emission spectra of Trp-saposins were obtained upon the addition to suspensions of phospholipids liposomes. The fluorescence emission spectra of saposins As (0W/W37F), (37W), and (81W/W37F) or saposin Cs (0W), (S37W), and (81W) were obtained in the presence of brain BPS liposomes. Maximal emission wavelength shifts to the blue direction were noted for the Trp-substituted saposins compared with those in a lipid-free background (TableI). This parameter for saposin C (S37W) did not change. Fluorescence intensities also were increased significantly upon Trp-saposin addition to BPS or synthetic PS (18:1,1) liposomes at acidic pH (Fig.2). These blue shifts and intensity elevations suggested interaction of saposins with liposomal membranes during protein-lipid complex formation. None of the Trp-saposin As or Cs showed blue shifts with the neutral egg PC or saturated phosphatidylserine (PS) liposomes. These results also show that the electrostatic interactions of the saposins with the charged head groups were insufficient to account for the respective spectral shifts. In the absence of phospholipids, saposin A (37W) showed the same maximal emission wavelength (λEM = 351 nm) as saposin C (S37W). This indicated that the polarity of middle regions in saposins A and C are similar in lipid-free solution.Table IFluorescence emission maxima of Trp-saposins in the absence and presence of BPSSaposinsEmission maximaEmission maxima−BPS+BPSnmA (0W/W37F)345333BlueA (37W)351338BlueA (37W/G64E)344358RedA (37W/K63L/G64E/M65V)339350RedA (81W/W37F)345336BlueC (0W)339333BlueC (S37W)351351NoC (S37W/Q48N)345339BlueC (S37W/Q48A/E49A)338329BlueC (81W)339323BlueExperimental conditions: pH 4.7, protein:lipid = 1:20 to 1:40 (mole:mole).

Fluorescence quenching experiments of Trp-saposins by aqueous (polar) or hydrophobic solid (nonpolar) quenchers were conducted to determine whether saposins interacted with BPS liposomal membrane at the surface or by insertion. Aqueous fluorescence quenchers, acrylamides, were used to evaluate the accessibility of the tryptophan residue in saposins to the aqueous phase in the presence of BPS liposome (Fig.3 A). With the liposomes composed of BPS, the blue shifts of the Trp-saposin fluorescence were protected effectively from quenching by acrylamide. However, saposin C (S37W), which did not have spectral shift, was largely quenched. In the absence of liposomes, all Trp-saposins were quenched to the same degree, and the degree of quenching was much greater than in the presence of BPS. Together with spectral shifting experiments, the results indicate that the middle region of saposin C around Ser-37 was exposed to the aqueous phase, whereas the amino- and carboxyl-terminals regions were associated with membrane lipids. In comparison to saposin C (S37W), wild-type saposin A (37W) was quenched much less by acrylamide in the presence of BPS vesicles (Fig. 3 A) (TableI). In the presence of BPS, saposins A (0W/W37F) and A (81W/W37F) displayed similar acrylamide-quenching patterns. These results indicate that the NH2 and COOH termini of saposins A and C and also the middle region of saposin A were within the lipid environment,i.e. not aqueous accessible. The penetration of saposins into the BPS membrane was confirmed using spin-labeled SLPCs. Various percentages of SLPCs (0–50%) were incorporated into BPS liposomes. The SLPCs contain doxyl groups that are located at different carbons (n) in the acyl chain: SLPC5 (n = 5), SLPC10 (n = 10), and SLPC16 (n = 16). After the addition of Trp-saposins, the protein/lipid mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 60 min, and the fluorescence intensity changes were determined. The results from the longer incubation time showed no significant differences. Substantial quenching efficiencies (30–60%) were obtained in the presence of BPS/SLPC5 liposomes for the Trp-saposins with blue shifts. For example, the Trp fluorescence of saposin C (0W), A (37W), or C (81W) was quenched 60% with BPS/SLPC5 (1:1 mole/mole) (Fig. 3 B). Saposin C (S37W) did not develop spectral shifts and showed no quenching with any of the SLPCs. The quenching efficiency also was dependent upon the location of the doxyl group in the acyl chain. Less quenching effect was observed when the doxyl group was located deeper in the membrane, e.g. with BPS/SLPC10 (1:1 mole/mole) the tryptophan fluorescence of saposin C (0W) was quenched by only 30% (Fig. 3 C). No significant quenching was observed with BPS/SLPC16. The SLPC5 was 5–20-fold more effective than SLPC10 or SLPC16. These results are consistent with the NH2and COOH ends of saposin A and B being within the liposomal membrane. The middle region of saposin A also was embedded in the membrane to a dep"

Upon BCR ligation, SHP-1 has been shown to associate with the BCR, the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk, and the inhibitory co-receptors CD22 and CD72. How SHP-1 is activated by BCR ligation and regulates BCR signaling is, however, not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that, in the BCR-expressing myeloma line J558Lµm3, CD72 expression reduces the BCR ligation-induced phosphorylation of the BCR component Igα/Igβ and its cytoplasmic effectors Syk and SLP-65. Substrate phosphorylation was restored by expression of dominant negative mutants of SHP-1, whereas the SHP-1 mutants failed to enhance phosphorylation of the cellular substrates in the absence of CD72. This indicates that SHP-1 is efficiently activated by CD72 but not by other pathways in J558Lµm3 cells and that inhibition of SHP-1 specifically activated by CD72 reverses CD72-induced dephosphorylation of cellular substrates in these cells. Taken together, BCR-induced SHP-1 activation is likely to require inhibitory co-receptors such as CD72, and SHP-1 appears to mediate the negative regulatory effect of CD72 on BCR signaling by dephosphorylating Igα/Igβ and its downstream signaling molecules Syk and SLP-65.

By negatively regulating BCR signaling whenever BCR is ligated, both of these co-receptors are implicated in setting a signaling threshold for BCR ligation. The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is involved in negative regulation of several receptors (18Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). For SHP-1 activation, its tandem SH2 domains need to be associated with a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide (19Pei D.

Indeed, SHP-1 is shown to be involved in negative regulation of BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling by a chimeric FcγRII containing the cytoplasmic region of PIR-B in the chicken B cell line DT40 (22Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Ono M. Takai T. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether intact PIR-B is involved in negative regulation of BCR signaling by SHP-1. In contrast, both CD22 and CD72 are phosphorylated upon BCR ligation probably because these co-receptors associate with BCR constitutively (23Adachi T. Flaswinkel H. Yakura H. Reth M. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4662-4665PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wu Y. Nadler M.J. Brennan L.A. Gish G.D. Timms J.F. Fusaki N. Jongstra B.J. Tada N. Pawson T. Wither J. Neel B.G. Hozumi N. Curr.

Thus, CD22 and CD72 may activate SHP-1 upon BCR ligation, thereby negatively regulating BCR signaling. Whether SHP-1 mediates negative regulation of BCR signaling by CD22 and CD72, and how SHP-1 activated by these inhibitory co-receptors negatively regulates BCR signaling has not yet been fully elucidated. SHP-1 is activated by various tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules other than ITIM-containing inhibitory receptors. Indeed, activation receptors such as erythropoietin receptor and IL-3 receptor are shown to associate with and activate SHP-1 upon ligand-induced phosphorylation (27Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 28Yi T. Mui A.L. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In B cells, SHP-1 is reported to co-precipitate with the BCR probably due to its association with Igα/Igβ (29Pani G. Kozlowski M. Cambier J.C. Mills G.B. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is also activated by tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as PTK ZAP-70, the homolog of the PTK Syk expressed in B cells (30Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether SHP-1 is activated by Igα/Igβ or Syk. A dominant negative mutant of SHP-1 has been used to assess the role of SHP-1 in the regulation of BCR (24Wu Y. Nadler M.J. Brennan L.A. Gish G.D. Timms J.F. Fusaki N. Jongstra B.J. Tada N. Pawson T.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 2717-2724PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant SHP-1 blocks the effect of SHP-1 activated by various different molecules. To assess whether a certain molecule, for example CD72, activates SHP-1 and whether its function is mediated by SHP-1, the dominant negative mutant of SHP-1 needs to be expressed in the cells where SHP-1 is not activated by alternative pathways. Such a cellular system has not yet been established. J558Lµm3 myeloma cells express surface IgM specific for the hapten (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl (NP) (33Hombach J. Tsubata T. Leclercq L. Stappert H. Reth M. Nature. 1990; 343: 760-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). J558Lµm3 cells do not express most of the membrane molecules expressed in B cells (34Wienands J. Larbolette O. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7865-7870Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) including the inhibitory co-receptors CD22 and CD72, but they express SHP-1 and various cytoplasmic signaling molecules involved in BCR signaling such as Syk and SLP-65, and BCR ligation activates these molecules (4Wienands J. Schweikert J. Wollscheid B. Jumaa H. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 34Wienands J. Larbolette O. Reth M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7865-7870Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, J558Lµm3 is a useful tool to analyze the molecular mechanisms of activation of SHP-1 and the function of inhibitory co-receptors. By using this cellular system, we demonstrate here that BCR-induced SHP-1 activation requires inhibitory co-receptors such as CD72 and that SHP-1 is a proximal effector molecule of CD72 to down-regulate BCR-mediated signal transduction. The expression plasmid pMKITSHP-1SH2 coding for a GFP fusion protein containing the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1 (SHP-1SH2) was generated as follows. TheNotI-EcoRI fragment containing the GFP cDNA and the EcoRI-PvuII fragment of pBluescriptSHP-1 (23Adachi T. Flaswinkel H. Yakura H. Reth M. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4662-4665PubMed Google Scholar) containing SHP-1SH2 were inserted into NotI andEcoRV of modified pMKITneo harboring NotI andEcoRV sites instead of EcoRI and NotI sites. The expression plasmid pMKITSHP-1C/S-Myc coding for a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1, in which cysteine residue at 453 was replaced by serine (SHP-1C/S), tagged by a c-Myc peptide (SMEQKLISEEDLN) are generated as follows. pBluescriptSHP-1C/S containing the cDNA for SHP-1C/S was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pBluescriptSHP-1 containing the mouse SHP-1 cDNA (23Adachi T. Flaswinkel H. Yakura H. Reth M. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4662-4665PubMed Google Scholar). The HindIII-SalI fragment of the DNA encoding the c-Myc sequence was generated by annealing the pair of synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-AGCTTGTCACCGTCTCCTCAGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGAATTAAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTTAATTCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCTGAGGAGACGGTGACA-3′). The SHP-1C/S cDNA lacking the stop codon was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a set of primers (5′-CCGAATTCGAACCCCAGGATGGTGAGG3′ and 5′-AAAAGCTTCTTCCTCTTGAGAGAACCTTT-3′) and pBluescriptSHP-1C/S as a template, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and ligated with the HindIII-SalI fragment of the DNA encoding the c-Myc sequence and the expression vector pMKITneo opened by EcoRI and XhoI. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using pMikCD72 (23Adachi T. Flaswinkel H. Yakura H. Reth M. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4662-4665PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the expression plasmid pMikCD72Y7F coding for the mutated form of CD72 in which tyrosine residue at position 7 was replaced by phenylalanine (CD72Y7F). The mouse B lymphoma line K46µmλ (35Wienands J. Hombach J. Radbruch A. Riesterer C. Reth M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and its CD72 transfectant (K46µmλCD72) (17Adachi T. Wakabayashi C. Nakayama T. Yakura H. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the mouse myeloma cell line J558Lµm3(33), all of which express µH and λL chains of IgM specific for NP, were described previously. The mouse B lymphoma line WEHI-231 was described previously (36Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Transfection of the expression plasmids into J558Lµm3 cells was done by electroporation. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 µm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm glutamine. For BCR ligation, J558Lµm3, its transfectants, K46µmλ and K46µmλCD72, were treated with 10 µg/ml NP-coupled bovine serum albumin (NP-BSA), and WEHI-231 cells were treated with 10 µg/ml F(ab′)2fragments of goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (Ab) (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH) at 37 °C. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse IgM Ab (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) or the combination of anti-mouse CD72a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9-6.1 (mouse IgG2b, κ) (37Yakura H. Kawabata I. Ashida T. Shen F.W. Katagiri M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1475-1481PubMed Google Scholar) and FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG Ab (Southern Biotechnology). Stained or unstained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (23Adachi T. Flaswinkel H. Yakura H. Reth M. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4662-4665PubMed Google Scholar). Cleared cell lysates were incubated with anti-mouse CD72 mAb 9-6.1 (37Yakura H. Kawabata I. Ashida T. Shen F.W. Katagiri M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1475-1481PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit anti-mouse SLP-65 Ab (4Wienands J. Schweikert J. Wollscheid B. Jumaa H. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-Lyn Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-Syk (C-20) Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP mAb (a gift of Dr. Mitani), or anti-Igβ mAb HM79 (a gift of Dr. Karasuyama) followed by addition of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation of SHP-1, rabbit anti-SHP-1 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-SHP-1 Ab-coupled Sepharose beads. Alternatively, cell lysates were incubated with anti-SHP-1 Ab together with protein G-Sepharose. After washing three times with lysis buffer, protein G-coupled beads or anti-SHP-1-coupled beads were suspended in sample buffer. Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to the nylon membrane. Membranes were reacted with rabbit anti-CD72 Ab (23Adachi T. Flaswinkel H. Yakura H. Reth M. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4662-4665PubMed Google Scholar), anti-SHP-1 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Syk (N-19) Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by reaction with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig Ab (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, membranes were reacted with peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), the combination of anti-GFP mAb and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab (Southern Biotechnology), the combination of goat anti-mouse λ chain Ab and peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG Ab (both are from Southern Biotechnology), the combination of biotinylated anti-Lyn Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or the combination of anti-Igβ mAb HM79 and peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). Proteins were then visualized by ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (23Adachi T. Flaswinkel H. Yakura H. Reth M. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4662-4665PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase activity of Syk and Lyn was measured as described previously with slight modification (38Flaswinkel H. Reth M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In brief anti-Syk or anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer and incubated in 20 µl of kinase buffer containing 2 µg of GST-Igα and 2 mm of ATP at room temperature for 3 min. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10. Western blot analysis of total cell lysates and/or flow cytometry revealed that J558Lµm3 does not express CD22, CD72, or FcγRII (data not shown). To address the regulatory effect of CD72 on BCR signaling, we transfected J558Lµm3 cells with an expression plasmid for CD72. For further analysis, we chose two independent CD72 transfectants (J558Lµm3CD72-1 and J558Lµm3CD72-24) that express CD72 and the IgM-BCR on the cell surface (Fig.1, A–F). Following BCR ligation of J558Lµm3 cells and its CD72 transfectants with the specific antigen NP-BSA, we monitored PTK substrate phosphorylation by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of total cell lysates. Tyrosine phosphorylation of various substrate molecules reached the maximum 1 min after exposure to NP-BSA and thereafter gradually declined (Fig.1 G). Substrate phosphorylation in the CD72 transfectants was much weaker than in J558Lµm3 cells, which indicates that CD72 expression inhibits BCR-induced substrate phosphorylation. One of the predominantly phosphorylated PTK substrates in antigen-treated J558Lµm3 was isolated and named SLP-65 (4Wienands J. Schweikert J. Wollscheid B. Jumaa H. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The antigen-induced phosphorylation of SLP-65 was much weaker in the CD72 transfectants than in the parental J558Lµm3 cells (Fig.1 G), suggesting that CD72 reduced BCR-mediated phosphorylation of SLP-65. This is directly shown by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting of anti-SLP-65 immunoprecipitates from J558Lµm3 and J558LµmCD72-1 cells (Fig.2 A). Next, we examined the phosphorylation of other BCR signaling molecules such as Lyn, Syk, and the Igα/Igβ heterodimer. The antigen-induced phosphorylation of Syk (Fig. 2 B) and Igα/Igβ (Fig. 2 C) was reduced in the CD72 transfectants compared with parent J558Lµm3 cells. In consistent with this finding, the kinase activity of Syk was reduced in the CD72 transfectant (Fig. 2 E). However, both phosphorylation and the kinase activity of Lyn were not up-regulated by BCR ligation in J558Lµm3, as described previously (39Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar), nor altered by CD72 expression (Fig. 2, D and F). Taken together, CD72 negatively regulates BCR-mediated phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as Igα/Igβ, Syk, and SLP-65 but not Lyn. To assess whether CD72 requires the ITIM for down-modulation of BCR signaling, we transfected J558Lµm3 cells with an expression plasmid encoding the mutated form of CD72 in which tyrosine in the ITIM was replaced by phenylalanine (CD72Y7F). The CD72Y7F transfectants (J558Lµm3CD72Y7F-3 and J558Lµm3CD72Y7F-5) expressed a higher level of CD72 on the surface (Fig. 3,B and C) than J558Lµm3CD72 which expresses wild-type CD72 (Fig. 3 A). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates was not reduced in J558Lµm3CD72Y7F-5 compared with the parent J558Lµm3 cells (Fig. 3 D). Essentially the same result was obtained with J558Lµm3CD72Y7F-3 (data not shown). These results show that the CD72 ITIM mutant fails to down-modulate BCR-mediated phosphorylation of cellular substrates. The ITIM in CD72 is thus essential for down-modulating BCR signaling probably by recruiting and activating SHP-1. Western blot analysis of total cell lysates revealed that BCR ligation induced phosphorylation of CD72Y7F in J558Lµm3CD72Y7F (Fig. 3 D), indicating that tyrosine residues outside the ITIM are phosphorylated in CD72Y7F after BCR ligation. In contrast, the same analysis barely demonstrated phosphorylation of wild-type CD72 in J558Lµm3CD72 (Fig.1 G), although more sensitive analysis using anti-CD72 immunoprecipitates showed phosphorylation of CD72 upon BCR ligation in these cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the ITIM negatively regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of CD72. Since the ITIM is essential for recruiting SHP-1, SHP-1 may dephosphorylate CD72, as reported previously (24Wu Y. Nadler M.J. Brennan L.A. Gish G.D. Timms J.F. Fusaki N. Jongstra B.J. Tada N. Pawson T. Wither J. Neel B.G. Hozumi N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To assess the role of SHP-1 in CD72-mediated dephosphorylation of cellular substrates such as Igα/Igβ, Syk, and SLP-65, we constructed expression plasmids for two distinct dominant negative mutants of SHP-1, i.e. a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-1 tagged with a c-Myc peptide (SHP-1C/S) and a GFP fusion protein containing the tandem SH2 domains but not the catalytic domain of SHP-1 (SHP-1SH2). We then transfected J558Lµm3 and J558Lµm3CD72 with these expression plasmids. Expression of surface IgM and CD72 in the transfectants was similar to that of the parent cells (data not shown). SHP-1C/S was dominantly co-precipitated with CD72 in the J558Lµm3CD72 transfectants (Fig.4 D), indicating that SHP-1C/S out-competes endogenous SHP-1 for binding to CD72. The dominant negative SHP-1 thus appears to block efficiently recruitment and activation of endogenous SHP-1. The J558Lµm3CD72 transfectants (J558Lµm3CD72C/S and J558Lµm3CD72SH2) and the J558Lµm3 transfectants (J558Lµm3C/S and J558Lµm3SH2) expressed similar levels of SHP-1C/S or SHP-1SH2 (Fig. 4, A–C). However, antigen-induced phosphorylation of various substrates in both J558Lµm3CD72C/S and J558Lµm3CD72SH2 transfectants was markedly enhanced compared with the parent J558Lµm3CD72 cells (Fig. 4,E and G), whereas J558Lµm3C/S and J558Lµm3SH2 transfectants showed a level of substrate phosphorylation similar to that seen in J558Lµm3 (Fig. 4, F and H). The dominant negative mutants of SHP-1 thus enhanced phosphorylation of cellular substrates in the presence of CD72 but not in its absence. Moreover, expression of SHP-1C/S enhanced phosphorylation of Igα/Igβ, Syk, and SLP-65 in the J558Lµm3CD72 transfectant (Fig.5, A–C), whereas the phosphorylation of Igα/Igβ and Syk was not altered by SHP-1C/S in the absence of CD72 (Fig. 5, D andE), supporting the notion that CD72 is required for enhancement of substrate phosphorylation by SHP-1 mutants. These results suggested that SHP-1 is efficiently activated by CD72 but no other pathways in antigen-treated J558Lµm3CD72. To confirm this notion, we assessed the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with the SH2 domains of SHP-1. Activation of SHP-1 requires association of its SH2 domains with a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide (19Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When we analyzed the anti-SHP-1 immunoprecipitates from J558Lµm3CD72C/S and J558Lµm3CD72SH2 cells treated with NP-BSA, CD72 was co-precipitated with SHP-1C/S (Fig. 6 A) or SHP-1SH2 (Fig. 6 B). However, no other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected. Taken together, SHP-1 appears to be activated exclusively by CD72 in antigen-stimulated J558Lµm3. This observation is not restricted to J558Lµm3 cells. Indeed, the inhibitory co-receptors CD22 and CD72 are the only major phosphoproteins co-precipitated with SHP-1 in BCR-ligated B cell lines K46µmλCD72 and WEHI-231 (Fig. 7). CD22 and CD72 may thus play a major role in SHP-1 activation upon BCR ligation.Figure 5SHP-1C/S enhances BCR-mediated phosphorylation of Igα/Igβ, Syk, and SLP-65 in J558Lµm3 in the presence of CD72.

Thus J558Lµm3 is a useful tool to analyze the role of SHP-1 and co-receptors in BCR signaling regulation. By using J558Lµm3 cells, we demonstrate that CD72 negatively regulates BCR-mediated phosphorylation of cellular substrates such as Igα/Igβ, Syk, and SLP-65. The substrate phosphorylation was not altered by the mutant CD72 lacking the tyrosine residue within the ITIM required for SHP-1 activation. Moreover, BCR-mediated substrate phosphorylation was restored by inhibiting SHP-1 specifically activated by CD72 using dominant negative mutants of SHP-1. Thus, SHP-1 is a specific intracellular effector of CD72 to negatively regulate BCR-mediated phosphorylation of cellular substrates. In contrast, dominant negative mutants did not enhance BCR-induced substrate phosphorylation in J558Lµm3 cells in the absence of CD72 suggesting that SHP-1 is activated upon BCR ligation in the presence of CD72 but in its absence in these cells. This notion is further supported by our result that among the proteins tyrosine-phosphorylated upon BCR ligation in J558Lµm3 cells, CD72 is the only protein detected to associate with the SH2 domains of SHP-1. This indicates that SHP-1 is efficiently activated by CD72 but not by other pathways because SHP-1 activation requires its association with a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide. In addition, CD22 and CD72 are the only major phosphoproteins associated with SHP-1 in BCR-ligated mouse B lymphoma lines WEHI-231 and K46µmλ. Taken together, BCR-mediated SHP-1 activation requires inhibitory co-receptors such as CD72 in both J558Lµm3 and B cell lines. SHP-1 has been shown to be associated with and activated by various tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules independently of inhibitory receptors. These SHP-1-activating molecules include stimulatory receptors such as the erythropoietin receptor (27Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F.

BCR ligation results in the phosphorylation of various molecules such as the BCR component Igα/Igβ and the cytoplasmic signaling molecules Syk and SLP-65 in J558Lµm3 cells as well as in B cells (4Wienands J.

Tsubata, unpublished data. However, our results indicate that Igα/Igβ, Syk, SLP-65, and Lyn are unable to activate SHP-1. Previously, SHP-1 was reported to associate with BCR, Lyn, and Syk (29Pani G.

These molecules may associate with SHP-1 without activating SHP-1 probably by interacting at the site outside the SH2 domains. The association with these molecules appears to be weaker than that with SHP-1-activating molecules because we detected association of SHP-1 with CD72 but not Igα/Igβ, Lyn, or Syk in both J558Lµm3 and B cell lines (Figs. 6 and 7). Recently, Igα was shown to have a negative signaling function in B cells (46Torres R.M. Hafen K. Immunity. 1999; 11: 527-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 47Kraus M. Saijo K. Torres R.M. Rajewsky K. Immunity. 1999; 11: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Igα may carry the negative signaling function either independently of SHP-1 or by activating SHP-1 through a yet unknown molecule that is not expressed in J558Lµm3 cells. Previously, SHP-1 was shown to regulate negatively both phosphorylation and kinase activity of Lyn in B cells and myeloid cells (44Yoshida K. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34663-34668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Somani A.K. Yuen K. Xu F. Zhang J. Branch D.R. Siminovitch K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1938-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, Lyn is not regulated by BCR nor CD72 in J558Lµm3 cells (Fig.2). In these cells, Lyn may not be regulatory due to lack of CD45 as introduction of CD45 restores BCR ligation-induced enhancement of Lyn activity (39Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SHP-1 activated by CD72 down-modulates phosphorylation of Igα/Igβ, Syk, and SLP-65 in J558Lµm3 cells (Fig. 2). Thus, modulation of Lyn activity is not required for SHP-1-mediated negative regulation of Igα/Igβ, Syk, and SLP-65, although dephosphorylation of Lyn may play a role in down-modulation of BCR signaling by SHP-1 in normal B cells. Previously, Dustin et al. (32Dustin L.B. Plas D.R. Wong J. Hu Y.T. Soto C. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2717-2724PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that co-expression of wild-type SHP-1 together with Syk reduces phosphorylation of Syk in insect cells, suggesting that Syk is a substrate of SHP-1. Because Syk phosphorylates Igα/Igβ in vitro (48Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), inhibition of Syk activity may reduce phosphorylation of Igα/Igβ. Alternatively but not mutually exclusively, SHP-1 may directly dephosphorylate Igα/Igβ. Since Syk is phosphorylated by association with phosphorylated Igα/Igβ (49Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,50Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), dephosphorylation of Igα/Igβ may reduce activation and phosphorylation of Syk even in the absence of direct dephosphorylation of Syk by SHP-1. Thus, SHP-1 appears to dephosphorylate Igα/Igβ, Syk, or both in B cells. Since SLP-65 is a substrate of Syk (3Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C.

Yet SLP-65 may also be a substrate of SHP-1 as suggested by Mizuno et al. (51Mizuno K. Tagawa Y. Mitomo K. Arimura Y. Hatano N. Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Yakura H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1344-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both Igα/Igβ and Syk have been shown to play a crucial role in BCR signaling (1Reth M. Wienands J. Annu. Rev.

Dephosphorylation of these proximal signaling molecules may be involved in CD72-induced down-modulation of BCR signaling events such as Ca2+ mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation (16Pan C.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These distal signaling events are not induced in J558Lµm3 and cannot be assessed in these cells. It is also possible that down-modulation of BCR signaling by CD72 involves other SHP-1 substrates. Moreover, other BCR co-receptors such as CD5 may also activate SHP-1 to coordinately control BCR signaling (52Sen G. Bikah G. Venkataraman C. Bondada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3319-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The J558Lµm3 cells may provide a useful tool to address these questions in the future. We thank Drs. H.

https://openalex.org/W1986215328,"Abstract G proteins act as molecular switches in which information flow depends on whether the bound nucleotide is GDP (“off”) or GTP (“on”). We studied the basal and receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange rates of site-directed mutants of the α subunit of transducin. We identified three amino acid residues (Thr-325, Val-328, and Phe-332) in which mutation resulted in dramatic increases (up to 165-fold) in basal nucleotide exchange rates in addition to enhanced receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange rates. These three residues are located on the inward facing surface of the α5 helix, which lies between the carboxyl-terminal tail and a loop contacting the nucleotide-binding pocket. Mutation of amino acid residues on the outward facing surface of the same α5 helix caused a decrease in receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange. We propose that the α5 helix comprises a functional microdomain in G proteins that affects basal nucleotide release rates and mediates receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange at a distance from the nucleotide-binding pocket."

Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). A family of at least six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) modulates the bioavailability of IGF-I and IGF-II. IGFBPs play an important role in regulating IGF actions by increasing their circulating half-life and by affecting their tissue distribution and localization. IGFBPs have been shown to inhibit IGF action by preventing interactions between IGFs and IGF receptors. IGFBPs also potentiate IGF action in vitro by co-localizing the IGF·IGFBP complex with cell surface receptors and promoting the subsequent release of IGF through a number of mechanisms, including proteolysis (2Baxter R.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 278: E967-E976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue expression and serum levels of IGFBPs are under a variety of influences, such as developmental, hormonal, and physiological conditions including pregnancy, and several disease states including tumorigenesis (reviewed by Rajaram et al. (3Rajaram S. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 801-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar)). IGFBPs 1–6 are generally thought to consist of three structural domains of approximately equal length (4Hwa V. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 761-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 5Baxter R.C. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). All six IGFBPs are characterized by highly conserved cysteine-rich amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, joined by a linker domain unique to each IGFBP species. Although the role of the IGFBPs in modulating IGF activity is widely accepted, the exact mechanism of interaction and the IGF binding sites on the IGFBPs have yet to be elucidated. The proposed IGF binding site on the IGFBPs is believed to be located within the highly conserved amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, as studies have shown both contain residues important for IGF binding (reviewed by Hwaet al. (4Hwa V. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 761-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) and Baxter (2Baxter R.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 278: E967-E976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The earliest insights into IGF binding regions of IGFBPs arose from observations that proteolysed fragments often retained residual affinity for IGFs. IGF binding activity has been reported for amino-terminal fragments of IGFBP-1, -3, -4, and -5 (6Huhtala M.L. Koistinen R. Palomaki P. Partanen P. Bohn H. Seppala M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although these fragments demonstrate IGF binding properties, there is a distinct loss of affinity, suggesting a requirement for additional components.

It is clear from the present investigation that the amino-terminal domain of bIGFBP-2 is capable of rapid association with both IGF-I and IGF-II but also exhibits increased dissociation rates compared with native bIGFBP-2. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal fragment forms a somewhat more stable complex with IGF than does the amino-terminal domain, although it is clear that both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains act in combination to form the high affinity complex exhibited by the native IGFBP-2. Furthermore, we have shown that the amino-terminal tripeptide of IGF-I and hexapeptide of IGF-II are involved in binding both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of bIGFBP-2. Recombinant bIGFBP-2 and truncated mutants were expressed in COS-1 (ATCC:CRL 1650) monkey kidney cells or Escherichia coli BL21 cells (E. coli B F−dcm ompT hsdS (rB−mB−)gal (DE3)).

Brownlee Aquapore C4 (2.1 × 100 mm) BU-300 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (rpHPLC) columns were purchased from Applied Biosystems. rpHPLC utilized Waters MillenniumTM chromatography software and a flow-through ultraviolet detector (Waters, model 490). Presiliconized tubes (Sorenson BioScience Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) were used for all protein handling. BIAcore 2000 instrumentation, software and reagents including CM5 sensor chips,N-ethyl-N′-{(dimethylamino)propyl)}carbodiimide,N-hydroxysuccinimide, and ethanolamine were purchased from BIACORETM (Uppsala, Sweden). cDNA encoding amino acid residues 280–284 of the wild-type bIGFBP-2 was replaced with cDNA encoding histidine residues using the primer 5′-TTT AAG CTT GAA TTA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG CAC CCC TCG AGC CCC CTG CTG CTC GTT GTA-3′ to incorporate a hexahistidine tag in bIGFBP-2 expressed using the vector pXMT2 (pGF8 (22Forbes B.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) and resulting in the clone pGF8HIS. cDNA encoding1–279IGFBP-2HIS was also cloned into the pET32a (+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) for E. coliexpression (pETBP-2HIS) using the NcoI-SmaI fragment of pGF14 (29Lucic M.R. Forbes B.E. Grosvenor S.E. Carr J.M. Wallace J.C. Forsberg G. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the SmaI-EcoRI fragment of pGF8HIS. Amino-terminal constructs were generated by the introduction of stop codons in the wild-type bIGFBP-2 cDNA by PCR, using the common forward primer 5′-TTG AGA TCT GGC CAT ACA CTT GAG-3′ and the reverse primers 5′-TTT AAG CTT GAA TTC TTA GTG CTT TTC GCA AGT GCC CTC GCC GTG GAC-3′ (1–93IGFBP-2), 5′-TTG AAT TCT TAC TGC TCG GGG CTG G-3′ (1–104IGFBP-2), 5′-TTT AGC TTG AAT TCT TAT CCA CCT CCC ATC AAG TT-3′ (1–132IGFBP-2), or 5′-TTT AAG CTT GAA TTC TTA GGG GGT CCT GGC AGG-3′ (1–185IGFBP-2), which introduced stop codons after the cDNA sequences encoding His-93, Gln-104, Gly-132, and Pro-185, respectively. The reverse primers also introduced an EcoRI restriction site (underlined) at the 3′ end of the PCR product to facilitate its religation into the parent vector pXMT2. These PCR products were also cloned into the pET32a (+) expression vector (pET1–132IGFBP-2 and pET1–185IGFBP-2) using the convenient NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites. To enable the secretion of carboxyl-terminal domains expressed in mammalian cells, an ApaI restriction site was introduced at the 3′ end of the sequence encoding the bIGFBP-2 leader sequence of pGF8. This ApaI site allowed subsequent introduction of cDNAs encoding carboxyl-terminal domains into the expression vector. The ApaI restriction site was generated using the Bio-Rad in vitro mutagenesis kit and mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CAC CTC GGC GCG GGC CCC GCA GTC G-3′. PCR products encoding the carboxyl-terminal domain of bIGFBP-2 to be cloned into the pXMT2 vector were generated using the forward primers 5′-TTT TTT GGG GCC CGC GCC GCC AGG ACC CCC TGC CAG-3′ (182–284IGFBP-2), 5′-TTT TTT GGG GCC CGC GCC GCT GAG TAC AGC GCC AGC-3′ (96–284IGFBP-2/96–279IGFBP-2HIS), and 5′-AAA AAT TGG GCC CGG AAG CCC CTC AAG TCC GGC ATG-3′ (136–279IGFBP-2HIS), which incorporated 5′ ApaI restriction sites (underlined) to facilitate ligation downstream of the signal sequence. The reverse primer 5′-GCC TTC ACA CGC TAG GAT T-3′, complementary to the pXMT2 vector, was used to generate the carboxyl-terminal construct 182–284IGFBP-2, whereas the primer 5′-TTT AAG CTT GAA TTC TTA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG CAC CCC TCG AGC CCC CTG CTG CTC GTT GTA-3′ was used to introduce a six-histidine tag at the end of the carboxyl-terminal constructs96–279IGFBP-2HIS and 136–279IGFBP-2HIS. The reverse primers introduced a 3′ EcoRI restriction site (underlined) for ligation into the parent pXMT2 vector. The cDNA encoding amino acid residues 136–279IGFBP-2HIS was also introduced into the pET32a (+) vector (pET136–279IGFBP2HIS) using the forward primer 5′-AAA GGT ACC CCA TGG GGT CGG AAG CCC CTC AAG-3′, which introduced aNcoI restriction site (underlined), and the reverse primer 5′-TTT AAG CTT GAA TTC TTA GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG CAC CCC TCG AGC CCC CTG CTG CTC GTT GTA-3′, which introduced anEcoRI restriction site (underlined) and incorporated cDNA encoding a hexahistidine tag. PCRs were performed routinely with 10% Me2SO as described by Sun et al. (30Sun Y. Hegamyer G. Colburn N.H. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 372-374PubMed Google Scholar) to overcome secondary structure formation as a consequence of the high GC-rich content of the bIGFBP-2 cDNA. All PCRs were performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler (Norwalk, CT) using the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 90 s.fmol DNA cycle sequencing (Promega) and ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) confirmed generation of correct cDNA clones. Automated sequencing was performed at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science Sequencing Center (Adelaide, South Australia, Australia). Recombinant bIGFBP-2 and the truncated mutants were expressed in COS-1 simian kidney cells as previously described (22Forbes B.E. Turner D. Hodge S.J. McNeil K.A. Forsberg G. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Culture medium was collected every 24 h for 5 days. Presiliconized Eppendorf tubes were used for protein handling and storage. The pET constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 cells for large scale expression. Two-liter cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing carbenicillin (100 µg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at anA 600 of ∼0.6. Protein was expressed for a minimum of 4 h prior to pelleting the cells (5000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C). The cells were then resuspended to one-tenth of the original volume in 2.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with lysozyme (100 µg/ml) and sonicated (Sonifier cell disrupter B-30) three times for 30 s each on ice. The soluble fraction was collected (10000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and filtered. The expressed products of wild-type and amino-terminal bIGFBP-2 constructs were purified from transfected COS-1 cell conditioned medium as described previously (22Forbes B.E. Turner D. Hodge S.J. McNeil K.A. Forsberg G. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal histidine-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-IDA chromatography (Bioserve). Briefly, nonspecific interacting proteins were removed with 60 mmimidazole, and specifically bound protein was eluted with 1m imidazole. Wild-type and truncated bIGFBP-2 preparations were further purified by rpHPLC as described by Hobba et al. (23Hobba G.D. Forbes B.E. Parkinson E.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30529-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The eluted protein was detected by absorbance at 215 nm. The amino-terminal fusion protein was cleaved from the E. coliexpressed proteins by enterokinase (0.5 units/mg of protein, Invitrogen EkMax), and the products were separated by rpHPLC. Purified protein samples were analyzed by separation on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and stained with Coomassie Blue R250 as previously described by Hobba et al. (23Hobba G.D. Forbes B.E. Parkinson E.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30529-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All protein samples were lyophilized for storage. 1–132IGFBP-2,1–185IGFBP-2, 96–279HISIGFBP-2, and136–279HISIGFBP-2 protein concentrations were accurately quantified by rpHPLC using the extinction coefficients (εο) 1.0 × 106, 0.98 × 106, 1.09 × 106, and 1.07 × 106 µvolts·s·mg−1, respectively (31Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and standardized with accurately quantified IGF-I standards (εο = 2.51 × 105) (GroPep Ltd.). Lyophilized protein samples (10–30 µg) were submitted for electrospray mass spectroscopy to the Australian Research Council Electrospray Mass Spectroscopy Unit (Adelaide, Australia). Yogi Hayasaka performed the analysis on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences SCI-EX API-300 triple quadripole mass spectrometer. Amino-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 492 protein sequencer (performed by Denise Miller and Francine Carrick). Solution binding assays were performed as previously described (22Forbes B.E. Turner D. Hodge S.J. McNeil K.A. Forsberg G. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two types of CM5 biosensor chips were generated. IGF-I and IGF-II were immobilized to the first chip, and 1–279IGFBP-2HIS, 1–132IGFBP-2, and136–279IGFBP-2HIS to the second. A reference surface, to which no ligand was bound, was included on both chips. Ligands were immobilized to the CM5 gold surfaces by amine coupling as previously described (32Lofas S. Johnsson B. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 21: 1526-1528Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptides to be immobilized (12.5 µg/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7) were injected onto the activated CM5 surface at 5 µl/min (HBS running buffer: 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). The surfaces were then deactivated by passage of 1 m ethanolamine. Biosensor surfaces were coupled to final resonance values of ∼200 response units for IGF/insulin chips and 600 response units for IGFBP-2 chips. Various concentrations of analyte (200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 nm) were injected during the association phase for 5 min (40 µl/min), with HBS as the running buffer. The dissociation phase, initiated by passage of HBS alone, was carried out over a period of 10 min. The biosensor surfaces were regenerated by a 60-s injection of 0.1 m HCl. Samples were injected in duplicate in random order in at least two separate experiments. Kinetic data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software, version 3.0. All binding curves were corrected for background and bulk refractive index contribution by subtraction of the reference flow cells. Models were fitted both globally across the data sets and for a single concentration. Models used were the 1:1 Langmuir binding interaction describing 1:1 binding between analyte (A) and ligand (B) (A + B ↔ AB), and a two-state reaction (conformational change) model, based on a 1:1 binding of analyte to an immobilized ligand followed by a conformational change (A + B ↔ AB↔ AB*). The 1:1 stoichiometry for the interaction between IGFs and IGFBPs was previously established by Bourner et al.(33Bourner M.J. Busby W.H.J. Siegel N.R. Krivi G.G. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated successful expression of 1–132IGFBP-2,1–185IGFBP-2, 96–279IGFBP-2HIS, and136–279IGFBP-2HIS (Fig. 2). Despite predicted molecular masses of 13,604, 19,439, 21,002, and 17193 Da, respectively, all appeared by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis to be greater than 21 kDa. IGFBP fragments consisting of amino acid residues 1–93, 1–104, and 182–284 of bIGFBP-2 were not detected in either the soluble secreted material or in COS-1 cell lysates. Amino-terminal fragments1–132IGFBP-2 and 1–185IGFBP-2 bound IGF-II by Western ligand blot, and 1–185IGFBP-2 exhibited at least a 79-fold lower affinity than wild-type IGFBP-2 for IGF-II in solution binding assays. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the carboxyl-terminal mutant 96–284IGFBP-2 indicated high levels of secreted protein in the conditioned medium; however, it possessed little IGF-II binding capability by Western ligand blot or standard IGF-II affinity chromatography. Consequently, a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag was introduced (96–279IGFBP-2HIS). Amino-terminal sequencing of the COS-1-derived material confirmed the correct amino termini for1–132IGFBP-2 (EVLFR-), 1–185IGFBP-2 (EVLFR-), 96–279IGFBP-2HIS (AEYSA-), and136–279IGFBP-2HIS (GAGRK-). An alternatively processed form of the COS-1 protein preparations with the amino-terminal sequence GARAE-, was co-purified as previously described (22Forbes B.E. Turner D. Hodge S.J. McNeil K.A. Forsberg G. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectroscopy was consistent with the amino-terminal sequencing data for COS-1-derived material, identifying both native and GARAE forms for1–185IGFBP-2 (19,429 and 19,784 Da) and 96–279IGFBP-2HIS (21,000 and 21,355 Da) preparations. As a consequence of the cloning strategy, material derived from E. coli expression incorporated an additional three amino-terminal amino acid residues (AMA), which were reflected in the molecular masses: 1–279IGFBP-2HIS (31,177 Da), 1–132IGFBP-2 (13,866 Da), and136–279IGFBP-2HIS (17,374 Da). Kinetic analysis of IGF binding by bIGFBP-2 and 1–279IGFBP-2HIS showed that they were essentially identical (TableI). In addition, a comparison using BIAcore analysis of the IGF binding properties of E. coli-derived and mammalian-derived 1–279IGFBP-2HIS and 136–279IGFBP-2HIS revealed that protein from both sources behaved identically. Furthermore, the change in intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-243 of bIGFBP-2 was the same for both1–279IGFBP-2HIS and 136–279IGFBP-2HIS upon IGF binding, indicating a similar change in environment of Trp-243 in both full-length and truncated bIGFBP-2. 2B.

Kinetic analyses were performed in both orientations of protein immobilized to the CM5 gold chip: i.e. the CM5 chips were derivatized with either bIGFBP-2/truncated bIGFBP-2 or IGF, with the analyte therefore being IGF or bIGFBP-2/truncated bIGFBP-2, respectively.

To identify interaction sites between the carboxyl-terminal region of PTHrP-(1–36) and the P1R, we prepared analogs of [I5,W23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide with individual p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) substitutions at positions 22–35.

The radiolabeled Bpa23-, Bpa27-, Bpa28-, and Bpa33-substituted compounds affinity-labeled the hP1R sufficiently well to permit subsequent mapping of the cross-linked receptor region. Each of these peptides cross-linked to the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the P1R: [I5,Bpa23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide cross-linked to the extreme end of this domain (residues 33–63); [I5,W23,Bpa27,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide cross-linked to residues 96–102; [I5,W23,Bpa28,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)- amide cross-linked to residues 64–95; and [I5,W23, Bpa33,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide cross-linked to residues 151–172. These data thus predict that residues 23, 27, 28, and 33 of native PTHrP are each near to different regions of the amino-terminal extracellular receptor domain of the P1R. This information helps define sites of proximity between several ligand residues and this large receptor domain, which so far has been largely excluded from models of the hormone-receptor complex.

Peptides containing the first 34 amino acids of PTH and PTHrP are capable of fully activating the PTH/PTHrP receptor (P1R) (1Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Brown E.M. Kronenberg H.M. Potts Jr., J.T.

Studies with PTH and PTHrP ligand analogs and receptor chimeras have suggested that the ligands have two distinct functional domains: the amino-terminal residues, which are important for receptor activation; and the carboxyl-terminal residues, which are important for high affinity binding (3Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Goldring S.R. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26469-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These data furthermore indicate that the ligand's amino-terminal portion interacts with the extracellular loops and the membrane-spanning helices of the receptor, and the ligand's carboxyl-terminal portion interacts with the receptor's amino-terminal extracellular domain (3Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Goldring S.R. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26469-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of ligand-receptor interaction has been suggested for other members of this class II family of peptide hormone G-protein-coupled receptors, including the secretin receptor (4Dong M.

Some specific sites of interaction between the amino-terminal portions of PTH-(1–34)/PTHrP-(1–36) and the P1R have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis and photoaffinity cross-linking studies. For example, mutational analyses have shown that residues in extracellular loop 3 and the adjacent sixth membrane-spanning helix (TM6) are critical for mediating ligand-induced receptor activation (2Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Rev. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 1: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Lee C. Gardella T.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Nussbaum S.R. Segre G.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M.

Consistent with these mutational data, Bpa introduced at position 1 of PTH-(1–34) or position 2 of either PTH-(1–34) or PTHrP-(1–36) was found to cross-link to methionine 425, at the extracellular end of TM6 in the P1R (9Bisello A.

Interactions between the amino-terminal portion of the ligand and the transmembrane domains/extracellular loops of the receptor are also suggested by a study showing that PTH-(1–14) can stimulate cAMP accumulation in a mutant P1R missing most of the amino-terminal extracellular domain as efficiently as it does in the wild-type P1R (11Shimizu M.

Furthermore, if a PTH fragment comprising the first 9 amino acids is covalently attached to the amino-terminal end of such a truncated receptor, the resulting ligand-receptor chimera displays constitutive activity, indicative of an intramolecular stimulation of the receptor's activation domain by the tethered ligand fragment (12Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19456-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast to the amino-terminal portion of the ligand, less is known about the interaction of the mid- and carboxyl-terminal region of PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP-(1–36) with the P1R. Initial studies with different P1R chimeras indicated that the carboxyl-terminal portion of PTH-(1–34) interacts with the receptor's amino-terminal extracellular domain (13Jüppner H. Schipani E. Bringhurst F.R. McClure I. Keutmann H.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This domain in the P1R is quite large (∼190 amino acids, including the 22-amino acid signal sequence) and can be further subdivided based on the exons that encode it: S-(1–25), E1-(26–60), E2-(61–105), E3-(106–141), and G-(142–181) (14Kong X.F.

Ligand residue 23 (Phe in PTHrP and Trp in PTH) has been found to be important for high affinity binding to the P1R and to the PTH-2 receptor (16Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Jensen G.S. Usdin T.B.

Replacement of this residue with a Bpa photoreactive group results in affinity cross-linking to residues 23–40 of the rat P1R, at the extreme end of the amino-terminal extracellular domain. Two residues within this region, Thr33 and Gln37, were shown to be important for binding of PTHrP-(7–34) (18Mannstadt M. Luck M.D. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. J. Biol.

Affinity cross-linking studies using a PTH-(1–34) analog with a photoreactive benzoyl group attached to Lys13, in the center of the ligand, demonstrated an interaction to P1R residue Arg186, located near the first transmembrane helix (22Adams A.E. Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based upon the available physical data, two computer models have been constructed for the complex formed between PTH-(1–34) and the P1R, and these models include interactions between residues in the carboxyl-terminal portion of PTH-(1–34) or PTHrP-(1–36) and residues in the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the P1R (23Rölz C.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6397-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), utilized a solution-phase NMR structure of the ligand, which indicates two α-helices separated by a flexible linker region. Using the previously described cross-link between residue 13 in PTH-(1–34) and Arg186 of the P1R as a constraint (22Adams A.E. Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the model aligns the carboxyl-terminal helix of PTH-(1–34) with a putative α-helix comprising residues 180–189 of the receptor, at the proximal portion of the amino-terminal extracellular domain (23Rölz C. Pellegrini M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6397-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This model was later modified to include the cross-link sites of ligand positions 23 and 27, but the revised model was not assessed by molecular dynamic simulations (25Piserchio A. Bisello A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8153-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A second model was reported with the recent x-ray crystallographic structure of PTH-(1–34) (24Jin L. Briggs S.L. Chandrasekhar S. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Schevitz R.W. Smiley D.L. Tashjian A.H.

The crystal structure showed the peptide to contain an extended α-helix spanning nearly the entire chain length (residues 3–32), with a 15° bend in the center (24Jin L. Briggs S.L. Chandrasekhar S.

This alignment predicted a hydrophobic interaction between residues Trp23, Leu24, and Leu28 of PTH-(1–34) and Phe173, Leu174 of the P1R; and a polar interaction between Lys27 of PTH-(1–34) and Glu169 of the P1R. The accompanying computer-based model of PTHrP-(1–34) complexed with the P1R predicts the same ligand-receptor interactions, with the exception that Leu27 of PTHrP-(1–34) also participated in the hydrophobic interactions with residues Phe173 and Leu174 of the P1R (24Jin L.

To help further elucidate the interactions that occur between the carboxyl-terminal region of the ligand and the P1R, we undertook a photoaffinity cross-linking study utilizing PTHrP-(1–36) analogs with individual Bpa substitutions of residues 22–35. Although not all of the analogs were informative, the overall results establish that multiple regions of the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the P1R are in close proximity to the carboxyl-terminal portion of PTHrP-(1–36). [I5,W23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide and analogs of this peptide with Bpa substitutions placed in positions 22–35, along with rat [Nle8,21,Y34]PTH-(1–34)-amide (rPTH-(1–34)), rat [Nle8,21,Bpa27,Y34] PTH-(1–34)-amide, and [Bpa27,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide were synthesized by the Protein and Peptide Core Facility at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) by the solid-phase method on PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 430A and 431A synthesizers.

Cells were seeded in 24-well plates for radioreceptor and cAMP assays. For cross-linking experiments, cells were seeded in either 6-well plates (for COS-7 cells transfection) or 15-mm plates (HKrk-B7 cells). For transfection, once the monolayer of COS-7 cells reached ∼80% confluency, cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described (28Lee C. Luck M.D. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 200 ng of plasmid DNA/well in 24-well plates or 800 ng of plasmid/well in 6-well plates. After 3 days, cells were used for the experiments. HKrk-B7 cells were used in experiments once the monolayer reached confluency. Radiolabeled peptides were prepared by chloramine-T iodination followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification using a 30–50% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min as previously described (29Jüppner H.

Binding assays were performed as previously described (5Bergwitz C. Juseaume S.A. Luck M.D. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. J. Biol.

In brief, 125I-labeled radioligands, rPTH-(1–34) or [I5,W23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide, were incubated with cells expressing P1R in the presence of varying concentrations (0–10−6m) of unlabeled peptide. After 4-h incubation at 15 °C, the binding mixture was removed and cells were rinsed twice with cold buffer. Cells were lysed, and the entire lysate was counted for gamma irradiation. Intracellular cAMP accumulation was measured by radioimmunoassay as previously described (5Bergwitz C. Juseaume S.A. Luck M.D. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28861-28868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells either transiently or stably expressing P1R or P1R mutants were incubated with125I-labeled Bpa-containing peptides (3 million cpm/well in 6-well plates, 10–20 million cpm/plate in 15-mm plates) for 6 h at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed twice and covered with cold buffer. The dishes were placed on ice under a UV light source (Blak Ray long-wave lamp, 366 nm, 7000 microwatts/cm2; UV Products, San Gabriel, CA) at a distance of ∼5 cm for 15 min. Cells were rinsed twice with cold acidic buffer (50 mm glycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.5) to remove noncovalently bound ligand. Cells were lysed using Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.15 m NaCl) and centrifuged at 1500 × g. The supernatant was then mixed 1:1 with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (final concentration 4% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 100 mmdithiothreitol). Samples were incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at room temperature for at least 2 h and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. For visualization of intact cross-linking products, dried gels were subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. For partial purification of cross-linked ligand-receptor complexes, wet gels were cut into strips and counted for gamma irradiation. Gel strips with peak radioactivity were electroeluted in a dialysis bag at 100 V for 2 h. Eluted samples were concentrated using Centricon-10 filters (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). For cleavage at methionine residues, the gel-purified, radiolabeled ligand-receptor complexes were incubated with CNBr (100 mm) in 70% formic acid at 20 °C for 24 h. After digestion, CNBr and formic acid were removed by repetitive lyophilization. For cleavage at lysine or arginine residues, the gel-purified ligand-receptor complexes were incubated with endopeptidase LysC or ArgC, respectively, at 37 °C for 24 h. For removal of N-linked glycosyl groups, samples were treated with N-glycosidase F (2500 units) for 3 h at 37 °C. Digested or mock-digested samples were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) or Tricine gels according to the method of Schagger and von Jagow (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10498) Google Scholar). Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Analogs of [I5,W23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide with p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) substituted at positions 22–35 were prepared for photoaffinity cross-linking to the hP1R. The apparent binding affinity and cAMP-stimulating potency of each of these analogs was assessed in HKrk-B7 cells. Most Bpa-substituted analogs competed with the radiolabeled agonist rPTH-(1–34) for hP1R binding with apparent affinities comparable with that of the parent peptide (IC50values: 7–74 nm, Table I) and stimulated cAMP accumulation as efficiently as did the parent peptide (EC50 values: 4–48 nm, Table I); only [I5,W23,Bpa24,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide showed a moderately reduced capacity to bind to the receptor (IC50 175 ± 25 nm), but this peptide showed potent stimulation of cAMP accumulation (EC5018 ± 1 nm, E max 131 ± 16 pmol/well). When radioiodinated, all Bpa-substituted PTHrP analogs except [I5,W23,Bpa35,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide cross-linked specifically to the hP1R, as indicated by SDS-PAGE analysis (i.e. photolabeling by each radioligand could be inhibited by excess unlabeled peptide, data not shown). The analogs [I5,Bpa23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide and [I5,W23,Bpa27,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide provided the highest yield of photolabeled ligand-receptor complex after gel purification (10,000–15,000 cpm per 15-cm plate of HKrk-B7 cells), whereas [I5,W23,Bpa33,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide (∼2500 cpm per 15-cm plate) and [I5,W23,Bpa28,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide (∼300 cpm per 15-cm plate) provided lower amounts of product. The remaining ligands did not provide sufficient yields of gel-purified photoaffinity-labeled material to permit subsequent digestive mapping.Table IBinding and activation profiles of [I5,W23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide analogs with Bpa substitutions in HKrk-B7 cellsPTHrP-(1–36) analogBinding IC50cAMPEC50E maxnmnmpmol/wellParent17 ± 412 ± 1126 ± 11Bpa2220 ± 910 ± 1157 ± 49Bpa2328 ± 114.4 ± 0.1129 ± 6Bpa24175 ± 2518 ± 1131 ± 16Bpa2539 ± 1410 ± 1141 ± 8Bpa2620 ± 97.0 ± 0.3140 ± 26Bpa2721 ± 26.6 ± 0.2138 ± 13Bpa288.1 ± 2.47.8 ± 0.1152 ± 8Bpa2936 ± 1611 ± 1132 ± 10Bpa3053 ± 1110 ± 1118 ± 35Bpa316.9 ± 1.44.7 ± 0.1159 ± 11Bpa3257 ± 1412 ± 1191 ± 10Bpa3374 ± 1731 ± 1171 ± 7Bpa3442 ± 630 ± 1165 ± 12Bpa3547 ± 448 ± 2173 ± 25Binding of [I5,W23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide (Parent) and analogs of this peptide with Bpa substituted in the indicated positions was assessed by heterologous competition for radioiodinated [Nle8,21,Y34]rPTH-(1–34)-amide. cAMP accumulation was assessed by radioimmunoassay.

The cross-linked complex formed between125I-[I5,Bpa23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide and the hP1R in HKrk-B7 cells was gel-purified and digested at methionine residues with CNBr. The size of the resulting radioactive conjugate fragment observed by Tricine gel electrophoresis and subsequent autoradiography was ∼7 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2). Based on the previously identified cross-link interval for [I5,Bpa23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide and the rat P1R (residues 23–40) (18Mannstadt M. Luck M.D. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16890-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the observed fragment would be most consistent with cross-linking to either residues 23–32 or 33–63 of the hP1R (see Fig. 1). To identify which of these two receptor fragments represented the site of cross-linking, [I5,Bpa23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide was cross-linked to COS-7 cells expressing a mutant hP1R (delta-E2) in which residues 61–105 (encoded by exon E2), including Met63, are deleted. This receptor mutant has been previously shown to have PTH binding and activation properties similar to those of the wild-type receptor (8Lee C. Gardella T.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Nussbaum S.R. Segre G.V.

In contrast to the radiolabeled band seen with COS-7 cells expressing the wild-type hP1R, which was indistinguishable from the band observed with HKrk-B7 cells (data not shown), the CNBr-digested complex obtained with the delta-E2 mutant showed a large, broad band at ∼50 kDa (Fig.2, right panel). This size was consistent with a cross-link to the glycosylated receptor fragment that comprises residues 33–60/106–189. The smaller CNBr-generated band observed with the wild-type hP1R affinity labeled by125I-[I5,Bpa23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide thus corresponds to the receptor fragment comprising residues Thr33 through Met63. Different results were obtained when complexes of hP1R and either radiolabeled [I5,W23,Bpa27,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide, [I5,W23,Bpa28,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide, or [I5,W23,Bpa33,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide were digested with CNBr. Each of these digested ligand-receptor complexes showed a broad band of ∼50 kDa upon Tricine gel analysis, indicating that the CNBr-generated ligand/receptor conjugate fragment was glycosylated (Fig. 3). These findings were consistent with cross-linking of each of the three Bpa groups to the region of the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor delimited by Glu64 and Met189; a region that is carboxyl to the [I5,Bpa23,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide cross-linking site (see Fig. 1). [I5,W23,Bpa33,Y36]PTHrP-(1–36)-amide contained the most carboxyl-terminal Bpa-substitution analyzed to date for PTH or PTHrP. The complex"

In eukaryotes, the transmembrane β-subunit (SRβ) of the SRP receptor anchors the peripheral membrane α-subunit (SRα) on the ER membrane through an interaction between the GTP-binding domain of SRβ (18Legate K.R. Falcone D. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27439-27446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the amino-terminal domain of SRα (19Young J.C. Ursini J. Legate K.R. Miller J.D. Walter P. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15650-15657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). No homolog of SRβ has been identified in the E. coli genome sequence. Although SRα and FtsY are homologous over two-thirds of their lengths, the amino-terminal domains are highly divergent (14Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P.J. Brenner S. Walter P. Nature. 1989; 340: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 15Romisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehn S. Frank R. Vingron M. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1989; 340: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Instead of the SRβ-binding domain found in SRα, FtsY has a highly negatively charged A region at the amino terminus (arbitrarily defined as amino acids 1–196) (20Gill D.R. Salmond G.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that, together with the central N region (amino acids 197–280), forms the minimum domain sufficient for assembly on the E. coli inner membrane (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutations that abolish attachment of FtsY to the E. coli inner membrane interfere with protein targeting and cell viability (8Powers T. Walter P.

Both bilayer and non-bilayer phospholipids have been implicated in the assembly and activity of several components of the secretory pathway inE. coli, including SecA (23Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 24Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2472-2478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have demonstrated the presence of a region in the carboxyl-terminal region of FtsY that may be regulated by binding to anionic phospholipids (26de Leeuw E. te Kaat K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It was also speculated that a second lipid-binding site exists in the amino-terminal region of FtsY (26de Leeuw E. te Kaat K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here we show that the previously defined membrane-binding domain of FtsY binds liposomes containing the zwitterionic phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) independent of a protein receptor. Surprisingly, in the absence of PE, SRP-dependent protein targeting remains functional, and the FtsY membrane assembly domain binds to E. coli inner membrane inverted vesicles (INVs) via an interaction with a trypsin-sensitive component. This suggests that, similar to SecA of the general secretory pathway (23Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 24Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), membrane assembly of FtsY involves interactions with both a specific lipid and a membrane protein. Based on these results and previously published data, we propose that FtsY binding to the membrane occurs initially through phospholipid binding, followed by targeting to translocation sites via an interaction with a membrane protein. Strains W3899, AD90, and AD93 (27DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in LB medium supplemented with 50 mm magnesium chloride. Plasmids pMAC988, pMAC1252, and pMAC1253, which encode full-length FtsY and the polypeptides FtsYA (amino acids 1–197 of FtsY) and FtsYAN (amino acids 1–284 of FtsY), respectively, have been described previously (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMAC141, encoding FtsYNG (amino acids 198–497 of FtsY), was created from plasmid pMAC1310 (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the technique described (28Hughes M.J. Andrews D.W. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 192-196Google Scholar) to remove the portion of the construct encoding the fusion partner gPa. A derivative of plasmid pHDB3 containing the AcrB576-AP fusion cloned into the BamHI site (2Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) was first digested withSacI. To introduce a second HindIII site into the plasmid, the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-CATCGTAGAATCGGAAGCTTGCGTAGCT-3′ and 5′-ACGCAAGCTTCCGATTCTACGATGAGCT-3′ were then ligated to the linearized DNA. The resulting plasmid was digested with HindIII, and the fragment containing the AcrB576-AP fusion was ligated into theHindIII site of parc-FtsY(WT) or FtsY(G385A) (2Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) to make plasmids pJH10 and pJH11, respectively. A secondHindIII site was introduced into plasmid pHP44 (29Tian H. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4730-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by ligating the oligonucleotides listed above into the uniqueSacI site. The resulting plasmid was then digested withHindIII, and the fragment containing the AcrB576-PBST fusion was ligated into the HindIII site of parc-FtsY(WT) or FtsY(G385A) to make plasmids pJH12 and pJH13, respectively. In all of these plasmids, the ftsY and acrB genes are transcribed in opposite directions. INVs were isolated from E. coli strain W3899 or AD93 as described previously (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To inactivate surface proteins on the INVs by proteolysis, INVs were adjusted to 10 mm calcium chloride (to stabilize the membranes) and treated with 50 µg/ml trypsin or 100 µg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 24 °C. Following inhibition of trypsin and other proteases with an inhibitor mixture (containing 20 µg/ml each chymostatin, antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin and 40 µg/ml aprotinin) and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, vesicles were adjusted to 500 mm potassium acetate and collected by centrifugation over a 0.5 m sucrose cushion at 70,000 rpm (215,000 ×g) in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor. As an alternative means of inactivating surface proteins, separate aliquots of INVs were treated with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide at 37 °C for 30 min at pH 7.5 and collected as described above. Phospholipid liposomes were generated using purified lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) in 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) by passing the suspension though a 0.1-µm filter 10 times using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.). Microsomes (CRMs) were isolated from canine pancreas as described (19Young J.C. Ursini J. Legate K.R. Miller J.D. Walter P. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15650-15657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transcribed in vitro using SP6 polymerase, and then polypeptides were synthesized from unpurified transcription products and labeled with [35S]methionine using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system. Translation products (20 µl) were incubated for 45 min at 24 °C with 1 µl of canine pancreatic microsomes, inverted vesicles, or phospholipid liposomes. To assess targeting to microsomes and inverted vesicles, the mixture was loaded onto a 0.8-ml column of Sepharose CL-2B equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT in a 1-ml syringe. The column was eluted with the same buffer; fractions (two drops each) were collected; and 8-µl samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The included and excluded volumes of the Sepharose CL-2B columns were calibrated as described (19Young J.C. Ursini J. Legate K.R. Miller J.D. Walter P. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15650-15657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Binding to liposomes was assayed by liposome flotation. The mixture was adjusted to a final sucrose concentration of 1.6 m, and 50 µl was overlaid with sucrose steps of 100 µl (1.25 msucrose) and 50 µl (0.25 m sucrose) in 50 mmTris acetate (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT. Following centrifugation in a Beckman TLA100 rotor at 100,000 rpm (435,000 × g) for 90 min, the gradient was divided into 40-µl fractions, and the pellet was solubilized in 40 µl of 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) and 1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. Equivalent aliquots of these fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, radioactivity in the dried polyacrylamide gel was recorded using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Myelin basic protein was a gift from Dr. George Harauz (30Mac Millan S.V. Ishiyama N. White G.F. Palaniyar N. Hallett F.R. Harauz G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). FtsYAN-gPa and FtsYA-gPa have been described previously (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and were purified on a 1-ml IgG-Sepharose column and eluted with 500 mm ammonium acetate (pH 3.4). Purified protein was dialyzed four times against a 1000-fold buffer excess consisting of 50 mm triethanolamine acetate and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) and stored at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. For light scattering measurements, at time 0, 10 µg of myelin basic protein, FtsYAN-gPa, FtsYA-gPa, or buffer alone was added to 1 ml of 0.01 mg/ml liposomes in a 1-cm path length cuvette using a remote sample injector and a cell equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Using a Photon Technology International Model C-44 fluorometer, light of 550-nm wavelength was directed through the sample, and photons scattered at 90° to the sample were detected at 1-s intervals (collection time of 1 s/point) through a 1-nm slit using a photomultiplier and recorded using FeliXTM software (Photon Technology International). For graphical comparison, counts obtained using purified proteins at the indicated concentrations in buffer without lipids were subtracted from the values obtained in the presence of liposomes. 40-µl fractions from flotation assays (described above) or equivalent amounts of reticulocyte lysate translations were incubated with trypsin at a final concentration of 0, 2, or 20 pg/µl for 30 min at 24 °C. Following this incubation period, the samples were immediately diluted in loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 0.5m DTT), boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, radioactivity in the dried polyacrylamide gel was recorded using the PhosphorImager. To monitor membrane protein insertion, AD90 cells that were freshly cured of plasmid pDD72 as previously described (27DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and W3899 cells were both transformed with a plasmid from the pJH10–13 series. Cells containing plasmid pJH10 or pJH11 were grown overnight at 37 °C in MOPS minimal medium supplemented with all the amino acids except cysteine and methionine and 50 µg/ml ampicillin, washed, and added to fresh medium atA 550 = 0.05. When the cultures reachedA 550 = 0.3, 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to cells containing pJH11. After an additional incubation of 40 min, cells were radiolabeled, converted to spheroplasts, and subjected to proteinase K digestion as described previously (2Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). AP-containing polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antiserum (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) and resolved by SDS-PAGE as previously described (2Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Cells containing plasmid pJH12 or pJH13 were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 mm MgCl2 and 100 µg/ml ampicillin, washed, and diluted. The cultures were divided in half when they reached A 550 = 0.1, and 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to one portion. Samples were removed from each culture after an additional 20-min incubation, and proteins were precipitated with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and biotinylated AcrB-PBST fusion protein was detected as previously described (29Tian H. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4730-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated, using a column chromatography-based assay, that the AN domain of FtsY (amino acids 1–284) specifically interacts with E. coli INVs, whereas the A region alone (amino acids 1–197) is unable to bind INVs (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of as few as 19 amino acids from the amino terminus abolishes binding (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the AN domain is the minimum membrane-binding domain of FtsY. To further investigate membrane binding of FtsY, we compared binding of full-length FtsY, FtsYAN, and, as a negative control, FtsYA synthesized in reticulocyte lysate to INVs and canine microsomes (Fig.1). As expected, reticulocyte-translated FtsY and FtsYAN, but not FtsYA, bound INVs and therefore eluted in the excluded fractions when subjected to gel exclusion chromatography (Fig.1 A, fractions 3 and 4,arrowheads). As seen previously, a fraction of membrane-bound FtsY was cleaved between the N and G regions (Fig.1 A, arrow). Unexpectedly, full-length FtsY eluted in the excluded volume when incubated with canine microsomes (Fig.1 A, upper panel, + CRMs,fractions 3 and 4). Since the exclusion limit of this matrix is sufficient to retain cytosolic proteins and large aggregates of FtsY within the included volume, this indicates that FtsY can also bind to the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As seen previously, a large fraction of the FtsY synthesized in vitro folded such that it would not bind to INVs, and although aggregated, it was recovered in the included fractions (Fig.1 A, upper panel, +INVs,fractions 5–12). Similarly, these molecules did not bind to microsomes (Fig. 1 A, upper panel,+ CRMs, fractions 5–12). When FtsY bound microsomes, it was not cleaved (Fig. 1 A,upper panel, + CRMs, fractions 3 and4; the migration position of the cleavage product is indicated by the arrow). This confirms our prior suggestion that the proteolytic activity that cleaves FtsY resides on E. coli inner membranes (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Binding of FtsYA and FtsYAN to microsomes was assayed to determine if binding of FtsY requires the same minimum domain required for binding to the E. coli inner membrane. The A region of FtsY eluted entirely within the included volume following Sepharose CL-2B chromatography (Fig. 1 A, middle panel,+ CRMs, fractions 5–12), demonstrating that it does not bind to microsomes. However, FtsYAN bound to microsomes as efficiently as it bound to INVs, confirming that the A and N regions together fold into a domain that binds to membranes (Fig.1 A, lower panels, compare fractions 3and 4). The relatively high efficiency of binding of FtsYAN to vesicles in vitro compared with full-length FtsY is likely due to decreased aggregation when the G region is absent (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the AN domain is sufficient for binding to either eukaryotic microsomes or E. coli inner membranes. We have previously demonstrated that the NG domain of FtsY does not bind INVs (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Binding of FtsY to eukaryotic microsomes via an interaction with a specific protein is unlikely, as there is no eukaryotic homolog for the FtsY membrane-binding domain. Therefore, it is possible that FtsY binding to INVs is also independent of a specific protein receptor. To determine whether a protein on the cytoplasmic face of the E. coli membrane is required for binding FtsY, proteins on the surface of the INVs were inactivated either by proteolysis or by alkylation of free sulfhydryl groups (cysteine) withN-ethylmaleimide (Fig. 1 B). Alkylation of INVs with N-ethylmaleimide had no effect on binding of FtsYAN (Fig. 1 B, fractions 3 and 4). Following incubation of FtsYAN with either trypsin- or proteinase K-treated vesicles, the vast majority of the protein continued to elute in the excluded volume following Sepharose CL-2B chromatography (Fig.1 B). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that FtsY binds to non-proteinaceous membrane component(s). Membrane phospholipids are therefore an obvious potential binding site for FtsY. To investigate the possibility that FtsY binds to E. coli membranes through an interaction with phospholipids, a liposome flotation assay was employed (Fig.2). The gradients in Fig. 2 were fractionated such that the floated vesicles were recovered in the 0.25m sucrose step (lanes 1, 2,7, and 8, arrowheads). In the absence of liposomes, full-length FtsY was found in dense fractions (Fig.2 A, upper panel, lanes 10–12). When incubated with liposomes, some of the full-length FtsY migrated into the 0.25 m sucrose step (Fig. 2 A, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 7 and8), confirming that it bound to liposomes. Similarly, FtsYAN also fractionated at the 0.25 m sucrose step only when incubated with liposomes (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 7 and 8). Compared with these molecules, only a small fraction of FtsYA migrated at the 0.25 m sucrose step in the presence of liposomes (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, under these conditions, the NG domain failed to migrate into the 0.25 m sucrose step in the presence of liposomes (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the AN domain specifically mediates binding of FtsY to membranes via an interaction with one or more species of E. coli phospholipid. FtsY is not cleaved in this assay, even after binding to liposomes (Fig.2 A, upper panel), confirming that the protease responsible for specific cleavage of FtsY (Fig. 1) is not present in the reticulocyte lysate. Using the flotation assay described above, lipid binding of the AN domain of FtsY was examined for lipids with different head groups (Fig.2 B). The inner membrane of E. coli contains four predominant phospholipids: PE, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cardiolipin (CL), and phosphatidic acid (PA). Although the ratios of these species vary between strains of E. coli, a typical wild-type strain (W3899) has a composition of 76% PE, 14% PG, 10% CL, and trace amounts of PA (30Mac Millan S.V. Ishiyama N. White G.F. Palaniyar N. Hallett F.R. Harauz G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the binding of FtsYAN to liposomes prepared from different combinations of these lipids. Since, in some instances, it was not possible to generate liposomes using a single lipid, we used PG as a “background” lipid in which to assess binding. PG was used for this purpose because, unlike PE, it was possible to generate liposomes from pure PG as well as other lipids in combination with PG. In each case, the liposomes were made from equal amounts of PG and the lipid being tested. In flotation assays, ∼12% of FtsYAN bound to liposomes generated from pure PG (Fig. 2 B). This did not differ significantly from the amount of FtsYA (used as a non-membrane binding control) that bound to pure PG liposomes (Fig. 2 B). A similar amount of FtsYA bound to liposomes composed of both PE and PG, whereas >50% of FtsYAN bound to liposomes containing PE (Fig. 2 B). FtsYAN failed to bind above base-line levels to liposomes containing mixtures of either PA or CL with PG (Fig. 2 B). Thus, it is likely that in vivo membrane assembly of FtsY involves binding to PE. To determine if FtsY binding to liposomes containing PE depends on a direct interaction with the ethanolamine head group, we performed competition experiments by adding ethanolamine to the binding reaction. We found that, in flotation assays, increasing concentrations of ethanolamine reduced the amount of FtsY that bound to liposomes. Ethanolamine at a concentration of 200 mm reduced FtsYAN binding to liposomes generated from either E. coli extracted lipids or PE/PG by 50% (Fig. 2 B). Concentrations of ethanolamine >200 mm disrupted liposomes and thus could not be assessed for effects on binding. We conclude therefore that FtsY binds to membranes in part by an interaction with PE. However, PE is not a major component of canine pancreatic microsomes, and FtsY binds efficiently to these microsomes, suggesting that the head group specificity is not absolute. The head group of phosphatidylcholine (PC) differs from PE only in that it contains a tertiary amine, suggesting that FtsY may bind to microsomes via this lipid. In flotation assays, FtsY bound to liposomes containing PC as efficiently as to liposomes containing PE (Fig. 2 B). To ensure that binding of FtsYAN to membranes did not simply reflect liposome aggregation, light scattering measurements were taken for liposomes composed of 50% PE and 50% PG incubated with an equimolar amount of FtsYAN-gPa, FtsYA-gPa, or myelin basic protein (Fig.3). FtsYAN-gPa has been shown to bind INVs (21Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. J. Biol.

Fusion to gPa permits purification of the fusion proteins following expression in E. coli by virtue of the affinity of gPa for immunoglobulins.Figure 4FtsY undergoes a conformational change upon binding liposomes. FtsYAN-gPa was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate and incubated with liposomes prepared from lipids extracted fromE. coli (lanes 1–6). Flotation assays were performed on incubations containing liposomes as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Following centrifugation, fractions from the top one-third (lanes 1–3, bound) or the bottom one-third of the sucrose gradient (lanes 4–6,unbound) and samples not incubated with liposomes (lanes 7–9, −liposomes) were treated with trypsin at a final concentration of 0, 2, or 20 pg/µl.

Recently, we have demonstrated that this receptor chain also plays an important role in the internalization of IL-13. To study the mechanism of IL-13 internalization, we generated mutated IL-13Rα2 chains that targeted trileucine residues (Leu335, Leu336, and Leu337) in the transmembrane domain and a tyrosine motif (Tyr343) in the intracellular domain and transfected these cDNAs in COS-7 cells. Cells that expressed a C-terminally truncated IL-13Rα2 chain (Δ335) did not bind IL-13, suggesting that the trileucine region modulates IL-13 binding. Truncation of IL-13Rα2 chain with a mutation in the trileucine region resulted in significantly decreased internalization compared with wild type IL-13Rα2 chain transfected cells. COS-7 cells transfected with tyrosine motif mutants exhibited a similar internalization level compared with wild type IL-13Rα2 chain transfected cells; however, dissociation of cell surface IL-13 was faster compared with wild type IL-13Rα2 transfectants. These results were further confirmed by determining the cytotoxicity of a chimeric protein composed of IL-13 and a mutated form of Pseudomonasexotoxin (IL13-PE38QQR) to cells that expressed IL-13Rα2 chain mutants. We further demonstrate that the IL-13Rα2 chain is not ubiquitinated and that internalization of IL-13Rα2 did not depend on ubiquitination. Together, our findings suggest that the dileucine motif in the trileucine region and tyrosine motif participate in IL-13Rα2 internalization in distinct manners.

We reported that IL-13 binds to two isoforms of 65-kDa proteins in human renal cell carcinoma cells, and one of these proteins also binds IL-4 (1Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

On the basis of binding characteristics, cross-linking, and displacement of radiolabeled IL-4 and IL-13 in various cell types, we hypothesized that, similar to the IL-4R system, IL-13R may also exist as three different types (1Obiri N.I.

Two different chains of the IL-13 receptor, IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 (also known as IL-13Rα′ and IL-13Rα, respectively), have been cloned and correspond to the two 65-kDa isoforms as we originally proposed (1Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The murine and human IL-13Rα1 chains were cloned first (7Hilton D.J. Zhang J-G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This chain binds IL-13 at low levels, but when coupled with the IL-4Rα chain (also known as IL-4Rβ) it binds IL-13 with higher affinity and mediates IL-13-induced signaling (9Miloux B. Laurent P. Bonnin O. Lupker J. Caput D. Vita N. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10Kawakami K. Taguchi J. Murata T. Puri R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 2673-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The second chain of IL-13R, termed IL-13Rα2, has been cloned from a human renal cell carcinoma cell line (Caki-1). This chain has 50% identity to the IL-5R at the DNA level, has a short intracellular domain, and binds IL-13 with high affinity (11Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M. Lelias J.-M. Lefort S. Vita N. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16921-16926Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Cells selectively internalize specific surface ligand-receptor complexes through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This process of endocytosis begins when receptors are selectively sequestered into specialized structures on the plasma membrane, termed clathrin-coated pits. These pits are able to recognize receptors through short structures of amino acids in the cytoplasmic domains (12Trowbridge I.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 14Kirchhausen T.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These domains contain specific targeting information. The most common internalization signals described are the tyrosine-based motif and the dileucine motif. The tyrosine-based motif contains a tyrosine residue usually composed of 4–6 amino acids and is generally formed of NPXY or YXXØ (where X is any amino acid and Ø is a hydrophobic residue; Refs. 16Collawn J.F.

Although the precise mechanism for the sequestration of surface receptors in coated pits is unknown, low density lipoprotein receptors are shown to be endocytosed via their NPXY motif (20Chen W-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, numerous other cell surface proteins including epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin receptor family, the β-subunits of three integrin receptors, and the amyloid A4 precursor protein utilize the NPXY motif for internalization (20Chen W-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the transferrin receptor and the asialoglycoprotein receptor endocytose via a YXXØ motif (16Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

It has been demonstrated that a dileucine motif in the intracellular domain of various receptor systems (e.g. interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) gp130, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, growth hormone receptor, human insulin receptor, β2-adrenergic receptor, lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor, and erythropoietin receptor) plays an essential role in the internalization of ligand (22Thiel S.

Although we and others have reported that IL-13Rα2 does not participate in the signal transduction pathway, it can bind and rapidly internalize IL-13 (10Kawakami K. Taguchi J. Murata T. Puri R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 2673-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,31Kawakami K. Joshi B.H. Puri R.K. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Feng N.

However, the mechanism of how the IL-13Rα2 chain mediates internalization is unknown (10Kawakami K. Taguchi J. Murata T. Puri R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 2673-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we generated IL-13Rα2 chain mutants that were transfected in COS-7 cells. The roles of the trileucine motif (positions Leu335, Leu336, and Leu337) in the C terminus of the transmembrane domain and the tyrosine motif (position Tyr343) in the intracellular domain of the IL-13Rα2 chain were studied in internalization assays using 125I-IL-13. Internalization assays were also performed by determining the cytotoxicity of a chimeric protein composed of IL-13 and a mutated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL13-PE38QQR) (31Kawakami K. Joshi B.H. Puri R.K. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

Blood. 1996; 87: 4333-4339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to cells that were transfected with IL-13Rα2 chain mutants. IL13-PE38QQR binds to IL-13R and is internalized by endocytosis, subsequently causing cell death through the inhibition of new protein synthesis. Thus, cytotoxicity observed in transfected cells indicates receptor internalization. Here we demonstrate that the dileucine motif in a trileucine region is critical for ligand binding and internalization, while the tyrosine motif is not responsible for internalization. Instead, the tyrosine motif appears to be responsible for cell surface IL-13 binding characteristics. We further demonstrate that the IL-13Rα2 chain is not ubiquitinated. Recombinant human IL-13 was produced and purified in our laboratory (39Oshima Y. Joshi B.H. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

For the other IL-13Rα2 mutants, PCR was performed using the primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGGCTTTCGTTTGCTTGGCTATCGG-3′ and 3′-GCACCGGTTACAAATATAACTAATAAGATGAAACC-5′ containing an AgeI restriction site, and 5′-primers containing an AgeI restriction site and 3′-GAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCAGAC-5′. Other 5′-primers with an AgeI restriction site were as follows: 5′-GTAACCGGTGCGCTTTTGCGTAAGCCAAACACCTACCCAAAAATG-3′ (L335A), 5′-GTAACCGGTCTGGCTTTGCGTAAGCCAAACACCTACCCAAAAATG-3′ (L336A), 5′-GTAACCGGTCTGCTTGCGCGTAAGCCAAACACCTACCCAAAAATG-3′ (L337A), 5′-GTAACCGGTGCGCTTGCGCGTAAGCCAAACACCTACCCAAAAATG-3′ (L335A/L337A), 5′-GTAACCGGTGCGGCTGCGCGTAAGCCAAACACCTACCCAAAAATG-3′ (L335A/L336A/L337A), or 5′-GTAACCGGTATTATTATTCGTAAGCCAAACACCTACCCAAAAATG-3′ (L335I/L336I/L337I). These PCR products were digested withAgeI restriction enzyme and ligated with the DNA Ligation Kit version 1 (TAKARA Shuzo, Shiga, Japan). Using these ligation reaction mixtures as template, PCRs were performed with the primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGGCTTTCGTTTGCTTGGCTATCGG-3′ and 3′-GCTCTAGATCATGTATCACAGAAAAATTCTGG-5′ or 3′-GCTCTAGATCATGTATCACAGAAAAATTCTGGAATCATTTTTGGGAAGGTG-5′ (L335A/L336A/L337A/Y343F) containing an in-frame stop codon. Finally, the mutant cDNAs for the IL-13Rα2 were subcloned into the expression vector pCI-neo using the XhoI and XbaI sites. All constructs were verified for sequence by ABI Prism 310 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plasmid DNAs (12 μg/100-mm culture dish) were transfected into semiconfluent cells using GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (2 × 106/100-mm dish) were incubated with the DNA-GenePORTER mixture for 5 h in DMEM (BioWhittaker). Then DMEM containing 20% FBS was added, and incubation was continued. 24 h after transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. To detect the mRNA expression of the IL-13Rα2 chain in DNAs-transfected COS-7 cells, total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and then RT-PCR analysis was performed. 2 μg of total RNA was incubated for 30 min at 42 °C in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, a 1 mm concentration of each dNTP, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 2.5 μm random hexamer, and 2.5 unit/μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 10-μl aliquot of reverse transcription reaction was amplified in a 100-μl final volume of PCR mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.1 μg of specific primer (5′-AATGGCTTTCGTTTGCTTGG-3′ and 5′-ACGCAATCCATATCCTGAAC-3′) (40Murata T. Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The PCR product (20 μl) was run on a 2% agarose gel for UV analysis. Recombinant human IL-13 was labeled with 125I (Amersham Pharmacia Corp.) using IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce) as previously described (1Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the radiolabeled IL-13 was estimated to be 6.0 μCi/μg of protein. For binding experiments, 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of binding buffer (RPMI 1640 containing 0.2% human serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES) were incubated with 200 pm125I-IL-13 with or without 40 nm unlabeled IL-13 at 4 °C for 2 h. Cell-bound 125I-IL-13 was separated from unbound by centrifugation through a phthalate oil gradient, and radioactivity was determined with a γ counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Internalization assays were performed as described before (10Kawakami K. Taguchi J. Murata T. Puri R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 2673-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 41Kuznetsov V.A. Puri R.K. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 154-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with the IL-13Rα2 chain were incubated in binding buffer containing 0.2 nm chloroquine at 37 °C for 5 min to prevent degradation of internalized 125I-IL-13. The cells were then washed, and 2 × 107 cells were incubated with 0.5 nm125I-IL-13 at 4 °C for 2 h. After removing free125I-IL-13, cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of binding buffer and incubated at 37 °C. At various time intervals, two duplicate sets of 50-μl aliquots were taken. One set was incubated with glycine buffer (final pH 2.0) for 10 min on ice. The suspension was then centrifuged through a mixture of phthalate oils, and the radioactivity in the cell pellet (acid-resistant or internalized) and in the supernatant (surface-bound plus dissociated) was determined. The other set of 50-μl aliquots was directly centrifuged through phthalate oils, and the radioactivity observed in the supernatants was used for dissociated 125I-IL-13 values. Surface-bound 125I-IL-13 was determined by subtracting dissociated 125I-IL-13 values from surface-bound plus dissociated values. To determine if proteasome-mediated proteolysis is involved in the expression and internalization of IL-13Rα2 chain, we pretreated COS-7 cells with 0.1% Me2SO or 50 μm proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. During binding and internalization assays, Me2SO or MG132 continued to be present in the binding buffer. The cytotoxic activity of IL-13 toxin was tested as previously described (38Puri R.K. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Kreitman R.J. Haas G.P. Pastan I. Debinski W. Blood. 1996; 87: 4333-4339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 104 cells/well were cultured in leucine-free medium with or without various concentrations of IL13-PE38QQR for 20–22 h at 37 °C. Then 1 μCi of [3H]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested, and radioactivity incorporated into cells was measured by a β plate counter (Wallac). Single, double, or triple amino acid substitutions in the trileucine region of IL-13Rα2 chain were performed by site-directed mutagenesis. As shown in Fig.1, trileucine residues resided in the transmembrane region of the IL-13Rα2 chain. Leucine residues were either changed to alanine or to isoleucine without any other modifications or combined with the substitution of tyrosine at position 343 by phenylalanine of the IL-13Rα2 chain. However, in some cases leucine residues were unchanged, while the intracellular domain of IL-13Rα2 chain was either completely or partly deleted or only one tyrosine residue was changed to phenylalanine at position 343. Finally, one mutant lacked all three leucine residues and the complete intracellular domain. To confirm the successful transfection of plasmid DNAs for IL-13Rα2 mutants in COS-7 cells, total RNA was extracted from the transfectants, and RT-PCR analysis was performed using primers that can detect part of the extracellular domain of the IL-13Rα2 chain (40Murata T. Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2A, wild type IL-13Rα2 and all of the mutants showed high expression of mRNA for the extracellular domain of the IL-13Rα2 chain. In naive and vector only (mock) transfected COS-7 cells, very faint expression of this chain was observed as we previously demonstrated (40Murata T. Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These data suggest that all IL-13Rα2 mutants were successfully transfected although COS-7 cells seemed to express very faint IL-13Rα2 mRNA. To determine the amount of protein for each expressed plasmid,125I-IL-13 binding assays were performed on various transfectants, since specific antibody to IL-13Rα2 chain is not commercially available for Western blot analysis. Mutated IL-13Rα2 transfected cells were incubated with 125I-IL-13 in the absence or presence of a 200-fold molar excess of IL-13. As shown in Fig. 2B, 125I-IL-13 bound to all receptor mutant-transfected COS-7 cells at similar levels with the exception of naive cells, mock-transfected cells, or cells transfected with the Δ335 construct. Excess unlabeled IL-13 displaced the binding of125I-IL-13, indicating specific IL-13 binding. Interestingly, in Δ335-transfected COS-7 cells,125I-IL-13 did not bind although these cells expressed mRNA for this chain. To investigate the role of the dileucine motif in the trileucine region in the C terminus of the transmembrane domain of the IL-13Rα2 chain, mutated IL-13Rα2 genes, Δ338, L335A, L336A, L337A, L335/L337A, L335A/L336A/L337A, or L335I/L336I/L337I, were transfected in COS-7 cells, and internalization assays were performed. We also performed internalization assays using COS-7 cells transfected with vector only that served as a mock control; however, their binding to radiolabeled IL-13 was too low to detect significant internalization (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3, dileucine motif conserved (two of three leucines unchanged) mutants, Δ338, L335A, and L337A, showed similar internalization levels (up to 80% at 120 min) as IL-13Rα2 when transfected in COS-7 cells. However, in COS-7 cells transfected with L336A or L335A/L337A, which has no continuous leucine residues, the internalization level was decreased to 65% (L336A) or 49% (L335A/L337A) at 120 min. Furthermore, in COS-7 cells transfected with L335A/L336A/L337A in which all three leucine residues were converted into alanine, the internalization level decreased to 40%, although the maximum plateau internalization level was observed between 90 and 120 min, whereas L335I/L336I/L337I transfectants showed the same internalization level (up to 79% at 120 min) as IL-13Rα2. These results demonstrate that the dileucine motif in the trileucine region of the IL-13Rα2 chain is necessary for efficient IL-13 internalization. In the intracellular domain of IL-13Rα2 chain, there is one tyrosine residue at amino acid position 343. To determine whether this tyrosine plays a role in internalization, mutated cDNAs of IL-13Rα2, Δ343, and Y343F were transfected in COS-7 cells, and internalization assays were performed. As shown in Fig.4, IL-13Rα2-transfected COS-7 cells internalized 125I-IL-13 in a time-dependent manner, and the internalization level increased up to 81% in 120 min. In Δ343- or Y343F-transfected COS-7 cells, the 125I-IL-13 internalization level was found to be similar to IL-13Rα2 transfectants (80% in 120 min). However, dissociation of surface-bound125I-IL-13 in Δ338, Δ343, and Y343F transfectants was faster compared with IL-13Rα2. The half-life (t 12) of the dissociation of cell surface125I-IL-13 binding in IL-13Rα2 transfectants was estimated to be 31 ± 2 min compared with 11 to 13 min in tyrosine-mutated IL-13Rα2 chain transfectants (TableI). These results suggest that although Tyr343 does not participate directly in the internalization process, it plays an important role in maintaining cell surface IL-13 binding to its receptor.Table ILigand-induced dissociation of cell surface 125I-IL-13 binding capacityTransfected chaint 1/2Maximum internalizationmin%IL-13Rα231 ± 281 ± 5Δ33813 ± 280 ± 7Δ34311 ± 379 ± 9Y343F11 ± 180 ± 7Half-lives (t 1/2) of the dissociation of125I-IL-13 from the cell surface were determined from the internalization data in Figs. 3 and 4. t 1/2 and maximum internalization rate represent mean ± S.D. of four determinations.

To further study this phenomenon and determine whether both dileucine motif and tyrosine motif mutatation in the IL-13Rα2 chain modulated endocytosis, internalization assays were performed using L335A/L336A/L337A/Y343F-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the125I-IL-13 internalization level was similar (32% in 120 min) to that of the L335A/L336A/L337A mutant (Fig. 3). However, this internalization level was lower than that seen in Y343F transfectants. On the other hand, the ligand dissociation was faster in L335A/L336A/L337A/Y343F compared with L335A/L336A/L337A transfectants. These results suggest that the L335A/L336A/L337A phenotype dominates over the Y343F phenotype as far as endocytosis is concerned; however, the Y343F phenotype dominates over the L335A/L336A/L337A phenotype for ligand dissociation. These data also suggest that Tyr343 in the intracellular domain of IL-13Rα2 chain is required to maintain cell surface 125I-IL-13 binding at physiological temperatu"

At 37 °C internalization occurred rapidly, within 10 min of ligand addition. Internalization was optimal in 293 cells expressing both RI and RII. Internalization was prevented by phenylarsine oxide, a nonspecific inhibitor of receptor internalization, but was not affected by reagents that interfere with clathrin-mediated endocytosis such as monodansylcadaverine, K44A dynamin, and inhibitors of endosomal acidification. Electron microscopic examination of Mv1Lu cells treated with 125I- TGF-β1 at 37 °C indicated that internalization occurred via a noncoated vesicular mechanism. Internalization was prevented by prebinding cells with TGF-β1 at 4 °C for 2 h prior to switching the cells to 37 °C. This was attributed to a loss of receptor binding, as indicated by a rapid decrease in the amount of TGF-β1 bound to the cell surface at 37 °C and by a reduction in the labeling intensities of RI and RII in125I-TGF-β1-cross-linking experiments. Mv1Lu or 293 (RI+RII) cells, prebound with TGF-β1 at 4 °C and subsequently stripped of ligand by an acid wash, nevertheless initiated a signaling response upon transfer to 37 °C, suggesting that prebinding promotes formation of stable RI·RII complexes that can signal independently of ligand.

Depending on the ligand-receptor system, internalization can serve to sequester the receptors rapidly, promote access of activated receptor to intracellular substrates, or in some cases, target the ligand and/or receptor to specific organelles such as the nucleus (1Bergeron J.J.M.

Internalized receptors can be recycled back to the cell surface, or in certain cases, internalized receptor and/or ligand can be targeted for lysosomal degradation. The latter process results in a net reduction in the number of surface receptors, a process termed down-regulation. The endocytic mechanisms underlying receptor-mediated endocytosis can be divided into two main types: endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits and non-clathrin-mediated internalization such as caveolae-mediated or “noncoated” vesicle-mediated endocytosis (6Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Endocytosis Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is by far the best characterized mechanism and is utilized by many receptors including G protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane receptors (e.g. β2-adrenergic and neurokinin 1), tyrosine-kinase receptors such as those for epidermal growth factor (EGF),1 platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin, as well as other non-kinase, single transmembrane receptors (e.g. transferrin) (7Böhm S.K.

In contrast, very little is known about the mechanism utilized for internalization or down-regulation of the more recently discovered family of serine/threonine kinase receptors for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). TGF-β-signaling requires the interaction between two functionally distinct Ser/Thr kinase receptors, TGF-β receptor types I and II (RI and RII, respectively). TGF-β binds directly to RII which induces the formation of an activated TGF-β·RII·RI complex. RII transphorylates RI which in turn phosphorylates intracellular substrates such as Smad2/3 (12Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3987) Google Scholar, 13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). An additional TGF-β receptor, type III (RIII), can form a complex with RI and RII. RIII has no kinase function but is thought to facilitate ligand binding to RII (14Lopéz-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 15Wang X.-F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing chimeric receptors, consisting of the extracellular domain of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) α or β receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of RI or RII, have shown that both homomeric and heteromeric combinations of RI or RII are capable of internalizing GM-CSF (16Anders R.A. Arline S.L Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This indicates that both receptors possess internalization motifs. Nevertheless, transphorylation of RI by RII was required for optimal internalization, and down-regulation was observed only for the heteromeric complex (17Anders R.A. Doré J.J.E. Arline S.L. Garamazegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggest that functional interactions between RII and RI set up distinct endocytic responses. Our own studies, using cells expressing full-length TGF-β receptors, confirmed the dual requirement of RI and RII for receptor down-regulation and also showed that RIII can enhance this process (18Zwaagstra J.C. Kassam Z. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, affinity labeling and microscopic analysis of cells expressing RII and RI tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicated that receptor internalization may be preceded by ligand-induced receptor aggregation/modulation at the cell surface (18Zwaagstra J.C. Kassam Z. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Taken together these findings illustrate the potential contribution of both the cytoplasmic and extracellular domains of the TGF-β receptors in endocytosis. Internalization of the chimeric GM-CSF/TGF-β receptors in GM-CSF-treated cells was inhibited by potassium depletion or cytosolic acidification of cells using NH4Cl and amiloride (16Anders R.A. Arline S.L Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Anders R.A. Doré J.J.E. Arline S.L. Garamazegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These treatments are known to interfere with clathrin-mediated internalization. However, as noted above, TGF-β binding promotes receptor modulation events that may be unique and are not necessarily mimicked by a foreign ligand and chimeric receptors. In addition, it has been shown for other receptor systems that endocytic routing can be altered depending on ligand-receptor affinities. For example, EGF and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), which both bind to the EGF receptor with similar affinities at neutral pH, show different endosomal sorting patterns, and this was demonstrated to be a function of the different dissociation constants of these ligands in the endosome where the pH is more acidic (19French A.R. Tadaki D.K. Niyogi S.K. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4334-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have therefore elected to preserve all possible aspects of TGF-β/receptor interactions and their effects on endocytosis by examining the internalization of native TGF-β in cells expressing full-length TGF-β receptors. In this study we have monitored internalization of125I-TGF-β1 in Mv1Lu cells, which endogenously express RI, RII, and RIII. Internalization was also studied in 293 cells transfected with RII and RI. Our results indicate that TGF-β1 is internalized rapidly at 37 °C and confirm that RI and RII are both required for optimal internalization. Our results demonstrate that known inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, such as monodansylcadaverine (MDC) or K44A dynamin, did not interfere with internalization and therefore suggest that TGF-β internalization occurs through a distinct mechanism. In support of this, electron microscopic examination of 125I-TGF-β1-treated Mv1Lu cells indicated that internalization is mediated via noncoated vesicles. Intriguingly, prebinding of Mv1Lu cells or 293 (RI+RII) cells with 125I-TGF-β1 at 4 °C prevented subsequent internalization of ligand at 37 °C. However, cells that were prebound with TGF-β1 at 4 °C and then stripped of ligand were able to signal upon transfer to 37 °C. This indicates that ligand binding at 4 °C induces formation of stable RI·RII complexes that are capable of signaling independently of ligand. Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu CCL-64) and 293 cells (CRL-1573) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). DR-26 cells were a gift from J. Massagué(Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). MLEC-32 cells were a gift from D. B. Rifkin (Kaplan Cancer Center, New York). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The RI and RII plasmids contained the coding regions for rat RI and human RII, respectively. Each gene, minus the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, was amplified and inserted separately into pcDNA-3. K44A dynamin (in pcDNA-3) was donated by M. Bouvier (University of Montreal) and initially provided by A. M. van der Bliek (San Diego). pcDNA3/erbB1 (the EGF receptor plasmid) was a kind gift from Y. Yarden (Rehovot, Israel). The Smad2 plasmid was a gift from L. Attisano (Univ. of Toronto, Ontario) Mv1Lu cells (or DR-26 cells) were seeded in DMEM (plus 10% FBS) onto 12-well plates (2.2 × 105 cells/well) for 18–20 h. The cells were washed twice with TGF-β-binding medium (200 mm HEPES-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) and then incubated in binding medium for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then treated with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 (NEN Life Sciences Products) in cold binding medium plus or minus 10 nm unlabeled TGF-β1 and immediately transferred to a 37 °C water bath for the indicated time periods. After each time period the cells were transferred on ice and washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2(D-PBS++), and 0.1% BSA. Surface ligand was removed from the cells by washing once with 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% acetic acid, 2m urea at 4 °C for 3 min. Internalized ligand was then extracted by treating the cells with Triton X-100 solubilization buffer (1.0% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 4 °C. The amounts of surface and internalized ligand were quantitated in a gamma counter. Specific counts (specific cpm) were determined by subtracting competed samples (plus unlabeled TGF-β1) from noncompeted samples. 293 cells were seeded in DMEM (plus 10% FBS) onto 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) for 18–20 h. The cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids (e.g. RII, RI+RII, or pcDNA-3) using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. After 20 h the cells were tested for internalization of 125I-TGF-β1 as indicated above for Mv1Lu cells except after incubation at 37 °C and subsequent washing with D-PBS++, surface ligand was removed from the 293 cells by washing twice with 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% acetic acid (minus urea) for 2 min at 4 °C. Urea was not included in the acid wash in this case because 293 cells were less adherent to the plates in the presence of urea. 2J. C. Zwaagstra, M. El-Alfy, and M. D. O'Connor-McCourt, unpublished observations. Mv1Lu (or 293 (RI+RII)) cells were washed once with TGF-β-binding medium at 4 °C. The cells were then treated with 50 µm phenylarsine oxide (PAO) (Sigma) for 10 min, 100 µm MDC (Sigma) for 30 min, or 500 µm chloroquine (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then transferred on ice and incubated with fresh binding medium at 4 °C for 15 min. This was replaced with binding medium containing 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 (plus or minus unlabeled TGF-β1), and the cells were then transferred to 37 °C for 60 min (for Mv1Lu cells) or 90 min (for 293 RI+RII) cells. In the case of K44A dynamin, 293 cells were transfected with either RI +RII plasmids or pcDNA3/erbB1 plasmid along with equal molar amounts of K44A dynamin plasmid or empty vector (pcDNA-3). After transfection the cells were washed and then treated with either 100 pm125I-TGF-β (plus or minus 10 nm unlabeled TGF-β1) for 90 min or 150 pm125I-EGF (NEN Life Sciences Products) (plus or minus 75 nm unlabeled EGF) for 60 min at 37 °C. Mv1Lu or 293 (RI+RII) cells were seeded and washed as indicated above. The cells were then incubated with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 in binding media (plus or minus 10 nm unlabeled TGF-β1) for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were then transferred to a 37 °C bath and incubated for the indicated time periods. Surface and internalized TGF-β was determined as described above. 293 (RI+RII) cells were washed twice on ice with D-PBS++, 0.1% BSA. The cells were prebound with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 at 4 °C for 2.5 h. The cells were then either kept at 4 °C or transferred to 37 °C for 0, 30, 60, or 120 min. At the end of each time point the cells were washed once with D-PBS++ at 4 °C and then treated with 1 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) for 5 min at 4 °C to cross-link bound ligand to the surface receptors. The reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine (final concentration 100 mm) for 5 min, and then the cells were washed twice with D-PBS++ and solubilized with Triton X-100 buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were electrophoresed in a 3–11% polyacrylamide gradient gel under denaturing conditions and the labeled receptors were detected using a PhosphorImager. MLEC-32 (mink lung epithelial) cells stably express a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor promoter (20Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N.

MLEC-32 cells were seeded in DMEM (plus 5% FBS) onto 24-well plates (8 × 104cells/well) for 18–20 h. The cells were washed twice with D-PBS++, 0.1% BSA at 4 °C and then incubated with 0 or 10 pmTGF-β1 at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells were then washed three times with D-PBS++, 0.1% BSA, twice with 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% acetic acid (for 3 min), and again two times with D-PBS++, 0.1% BSA at 4 °C. The cell were then treated with or without a second dose of TGF-β1 (10 pm) in DMEM (minus FBS) at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were then washed once with D-PBS++, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity using cell lysis buffer and luciferase substrate (Promega kit, Madison, WI) in a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthhold). Transfected 293 cells (1 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate), expressing RI, RII, and Smad2, were prebound with 10 pm TGF-β1 at 4 °C for 3 h. The cells were then acid stripped (as indicated above for MLEC-32 cells) and subsequently incubated in the absence or presence of 10 pm TGF-β1 at 37 °C for 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared, electrophoresed in a 8% acrylamide gel, and then transferred onto nitrocellulose. Phosphorylated Smad2 was then detected with an antibody specific for phospho-Smad2 (Geneka Biotechnology Inc., Montreal, Quebec) followed by electrochemical luminescence (Renaissance Kit, NEN Life Science Products). Mv1Lu cells were seeded onto 10-cm plates for 18 h. The cells were incubated with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 (plus or minus 10 nm unlabeled TGF-β1) in D-PBS++, 0.1% BSA at 37 °C for 10 or 60 min. The cells were then washed four times with cold PBS++, fixed in 2.5% gluteraldehyde, 0.1 mcacodylate at 4 °C, and then scraped from the plate and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was embedded in Epon-812, and semithin (0.5-µm thick) sections were prepared and placed on slides for the LM study. The slides were then coated with Kodak NTP2 emulsion for autoradiography and exposed at 4 °C for 3 or 12 days. Straw-colored thin sections (∼100 nm) of the same Epon blocks were collected for the EM study. These were coated with Ilford L4 emulsion, exposed for 2 or 3 months, and developed for filamentous silver grains (21Kopriwa B.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1967; 15: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The time course for TGF-β1 internalization was compared in Mv1Lu cells (which express RI, RII, and RIII) and DR-26 cells (a mutant Mv1Lu cell derivative that lacks RII). DR-26 cells bind ligand to RIII, but because they lack RII, they are incapable of binding ligand to RI and signaling (22Laiho M. Weis M.B. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18518-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Laiho M. Weis F.M. Boyd F.T. Ignoatz R.A. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9108-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They serve here as a negative control for RII-dependent TGF-β internalization. The cells were treated with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 for increasing time periods at 37 °C (in the absence or presence of 100 fold excess unlabeled ligand to determine nonspecific binding) and then washed twice with PBS to remove unbound ligand. Ligand bound to surface receptors was removed using an acid wash and counted (surface TGF-β1) (see “Experimental Procedures”). This was followed by extraction of internalized ligand by solubilizing the cells with buffer containing Triton X-100 (internalized TGF-β1) (Fig. 1,A and B). Internalization occurred rapidly, within the first 10 min after the addition of 125I-TGF-β1 to Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 1 A). The amount of internalized TGF-β1 increased rapidly and reached a maximum level by 40 min. Similar kinetics were observed in at least four repeat experiments with maximum values ranging between 3,000 and 4,400 specific cpm internalized (data not shown). A lower amount of internalized TGF-β1 was also detected in DR-26 cells. The levels in these cells, however, never exceeded 30% of that seen for Mv1Lu cells and may be the result of partial internalization mediated by RIII. These results therefore indicate that RI and RII are the primary mediators of internalization. The surface levels of TGF-β1 on Mv1Lu cells remained relatively constant between 10 and 40 min (∼2,000 specific cpm) and then declined (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, surface TGF-β1 for DR-26 cells remained at basal levels for the first 60 min (ranging between 0 and 500 specific cpm) and then increased slowly. The constant level of surface TGF-β1 seen for Mv1Lu cells during the first 40 min presumably reflects an equilibrium state between internalized and recycled receptors at physiological temperature. The subsequent decline in both surface and internalized TGF-β1 after 40 min may be the result of ligand depletion from the binding buffer and intracellular degradation of ligand in these cells. Degradation of internalized TGF-β1 has been noted previously in another cell line (24Massagué J. Kelly B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent studies using chimeric GM-CSF/TGF-β receptors indicated that GM-CSF-induced homodimers of RI or RII could result in internalization of GM-CSF. However, in the case of full-length TGF-β receptors, RI requires RII for binding to TGF-β. Therefore, in cells expressing both of these receptors, it is probable that heteromeric RI·RII complexes and potentially homodimeric RII complexes mediate internalization of TGF-β. To estimate the relative contributions of these receptor combinations we measured TGF-β1 internalization in 293 cells transfected with either RII alone or RII plus RI. Fig. 2 A shows that, as expected from our above results for Mv1Lu cells, 293 cells expressing RI and RII readily internalized TGF-β1. The level of TGF-β1 internalized in RI+RII cells increased steadily between 0 and 60 min and then started to level off. Internalization was specifically the result of the transfected TGF-β receptors because no internalized TGF-β1 could be detected in control cells transfected with empty vector (control). In cells expressing RII alone, the amount of internalization was reduced compared with RI+RII cells. In several repeat experiments, the maximum levels of TGF-β1 internalized by RII cells were somewhat variable but consistently lower than for RI+RII cells, ranging between 50 and 70% at the 90 min time point (data not shown). This indicates that RII can mediate internalization but does so less efficiently than when this receptor is combined with RI. Together these results imply that interactions between RI and RII and TGF-β1 are required for optimal internalization. It should be noted that the amount of TGF-β internalized by RII alone might be overestimated in Fig. 2 A because 293 cells express a low level of endogenous RI (as detected by cross-linking of radiolabeled-TGF-β1).2 Hence a percentage of the TGF-β1 internalized by RII-transfected cells is likely also mediated by heteromeric RI·RII complexes. The surface TGF-β1 levels were also monitored for the above cells (Fig. 2 B). In general it can be seen that compared with cells expressing RII alone, RI+RII cells had the least amount of surface TGF-β1 at any given time point, indicating a lower number of receptors remaining at the cell surface. This is consistent with the data in Fig. 2 A and indicates that cells with both receptors internalize TGF-β ligand and receptors more rapidly. In the procedure used for the TGF-β internalization assays shown in Figs. 1 and 2, internalization is initiated by the addition of TGF-β1-containing medium to the cells and immediate incubation at 37 °C. An alternative method is to prebind ligand to surface receptors at 4 °C for an extended period of time and then switch the cells to 37 °C to initiate internalization. This second method has been used successfully for other ligand-receptor systems to assess whether increased receptor occupancy influences internalization (25Waters C.M. Oberg K.C. Carpenter G. Overholser K.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows an example of a 37 °C time course for both surface and internalized ligand after prebinding of Mv1Lu cells with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 for 2 h at 4 °C. Control experiments done at 4 °C indicated that binding of TGF-β1 to the surface of these cells reached a maximum by about 1.5 h (between ∼3,000 and 4,000 specific cpm), whereas internalized ligand did not exceed basal levels (∼1,000 specific cpm) during the prebinding period (data not shown). After transfer to 37 °C, surface TGF-β fell quickly from an initial level of ∼3,000 specific cpm (at time 0) to a lower level of ∼1,000 specific cpm by 20 min and remained low for 60 min thereafter (Fig. 3 A). This reduction could not be attributed to internalization because no corresponding net increase in internalized TGF-β1 was observed and must therefore reflect a loss of ligand from the surface receptors. In contrast, in control experiments in which cells were maintained constantly at 4 °C, surface ligand did not fall below the level established after 2 h of binding (data not shown and Fig. 3 C). Together these results indicate that prebinding at 4 °C modulates the receptors such that their ability to bind ligand decreases when the cells are transferred to 37 °C (see “Discussion”). Loss of surface TGF-β1 accompanied by no internalization of ligand was also observed for 293 (RI+RII) cells after prebinding with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 at 4 °C (Fig.3 B). To visualize directly the effect of prebinding ligand on surface receptors, we used a cross-linking agent (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate) to label the surface receptors of 293 (RI+RII) cells radioactively with 125I-TGF-β1 after prebinding for 2.5 h (time 0) and at successive time points (30, 60, and 120 min) after switching the cells to 37 °C (Fig.3 C). This was compared with cells that were maintained at 4 °C after prebinding. On the cells maintained at 4 °C, no reduction was observed in the labeling intensities for RI and RII between 0 and 120 min, confirming that these receptors remain on the cell surface and continue to bind ligand at this temperature (Fig.3 C, compare second and fourth laneswith first lane). In the cells that were transferred to 37 °C, however, there was a progressive reduction in labeling intensities for both receptors (Fig. 3 C, comparefifth and sixth lanes with first lane). Similar results were obtained for RI and RII on prebound Mv1Lu cells (data not shown), confirming that these prebound receptors lose their ability to bind ligand at 37 °C. Our above results indicate that receptors that are prebound at 4 °C readily release TGF-β1 at 37 °C. A possible consequence of ligand release would be disruption of preformed RI·RII complexes and loss of receptor signaling activity. The signaling ability of prebound receptors was therefore assessed, as shown in Fig.4 A. Mv1Lu cells stably expressing a TGF-β-responsive luciferase reporter gene (MLEC-32 cells) were prebound with 0 or 10 pm TGF-β1 at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells were then acid washed to remove bound ligand, followed by a second incubation with (+TGF-β1, black bars) or without ligand (−TGF-β1, clear bars) at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. We reasoned that any decrease in receptor activity resulting from disruption of receptor complexes would be reflected in a reduced luciferase response at 37 °C in a short term assay, in this case 4 h. The +TGF-β1 response for cells pretreated at 4 °C without ligand (0 pm) was only slightly reduced compared with control cells that were kept at 37 °C (37 °C control), indicating that preincubation at 4 °C itself did not alter TGF-β signaling capacity significantly. Surprisingly, the cells prebound with 10 pm TGF-β1 but not treated subsequently with ligand at 37 °C (−TGF-β1, clear bar) still showed a luciferase response. The luciferase activity level for these cells was in fact similar to the +TGF-β1 response of the cells that were not pretreated with ligand (37 °C control and 0 pm at 4 °C, black bar). This response was not the result of residual ligand from the prebinding step because we have determined by cross-linking residual prebound 125I-TGF-β1 to surface receptors or counting surface radioactivity that our acid wash procedure removed 70–80% of prebound ligand (data not shown). Control experiments also indicated that the luciferase response of these cells to lower amounts of ligand (i.e. 2–3 pm, the 20–30% of the TGF-β1 that would be left as residual) was close to basal levels and could be distinguished easily from 10 pm(data not shown). These results therefore indicate that prebound receptors remain active even after TGF-β1 is removed and can signal independently of ligand. This was confirmed using 293 (RI+RII) cells expressing Smad2, the primary substrate phosphorylated by RI after its activation. These cell"

Two key rates in the ATPase mechanism, ATP resynthesis and phosphate release, were investigated using 18O exchange and stopped-flow phosphate release experiments, respectively. The 18O exchange results showed that the rate of ATP resynthesis on the topoisomerase II active site was slow compared with the rate of phosphate release. When topoisomerase II was bound to DNA, phosphate was released slowly, with a lag. Since each of the preceding steps is known to occur rapidly, phosphate release is apparently a rate-determining step. The length of the lag phase was unaffected by etoposide, indicating that inhibiting DNA religation inhibits the ATPase reaction cycle at some step following phosphate release. By combining the 18O exchange and phosphate release results, the rate constant for ATP resynthesis can be calculated as ∼0.5 s−1. These data support the mechanism of sequential hydrolysis of two ATP by DNA topoisomerase II.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar and 2Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the ATP-dependent transport of one DNA segment through a transient, enzyme-mediated break in a second DNA segment (3Berger J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Fass D. Bogden C.E. Berger J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic topoisomerase II enzymes are homodimers and are therefore relatively simple macromolecular machines for studying the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to protein and DNA movements. In addition to being mechanistically interesting enzymes, prokaryotic and eukaryotic type II topoisomerases are the targets of several antibiotic and anticancer drugs (5Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Maxwell A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Rapid-quench kinetic studies of topoisomerase II from the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed that this enzyme utilizes an unusual sequential ATP hydrolysis mechanism (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When the topoisomerase, pre-bound to DNA, is rapidly mixed with labeled ATP, followed by a chase with a large excess of unlabeled ATP, a burst of labeled ATP hydrolysis is seen within 50 ms (8Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The burst amplitude equals the enzyme active site concentration. These pulse-chase results show that the dimeric topoisomerase II rapidly binds two ATPs and hydrolyzes them both before either can dissociate. By contrast, when the reactions are chemically quenched, as opposed to being chased with unlabeled ATP, the burst amplitude equals half of the enzyme active site concentration (8Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This was the first evidence that topoisomerase II binds two ATPs, but only hydrolyzes one rapidly, before a rate-determining step in the mechanism. The results of studies using inhibitors and heterodimeric mutants confirmed this sequential mechanism and suggested that release of the first Pi or ADP was the rate-limiting step in the mechanism (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The rate of DNA transport was determined from rapid quench decatenation experiments and is consistent with transport occurring after hydrolysis of one ATP and before hydrolysis of the second (9Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mutants that can bind two ATP but only hydrolyze one catalyze DNA transport at approximately the same rate as the wild type enzyme. Mutants that bind two ATP, but hydrolyze neither, transport DNA at a much slower rate. Taken together, these results indicate that yeast topoisomerase II binds two ATPs, hydrolyzes one, transports DNA, and releases the products of the first hydrolysis, and, finally, hydrolyzes the remaining ATP. Two aspects of this complex ATPase mechanism that remain unknown are the rates of ATP resynthesis and Pi release. The rate of ATP resynthesis at the ATPase active site of topoisomerase II has been assumed to be slow in comparison to the rate of ATP hydrolysis (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In fact, a rapid resynthesis rate would provide an alternative explanation for the chemical quench burst amplitude equal to half of the ATP active site concentration (8Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ATP resynthesis was analyzed using the classical method of 18O exchange (10Hackney D.D. Stempel K.E. Boyer P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 60-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In order to interpret these results in terms of a resynthesis rate constant, the rate constant of the following step, Pi release, must be known. The rate of Pi release was measured by stopped-flow using a fluorescent Pi sensor (11Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Together, these results help to complete our understanding of how DNA topoisomerase II utilizes ATP to transport DNA segments. Bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPase),1 7-methylguanosine (MEG), myosin subfragment 1 (S1-myosin), phosphate standard, Trizma (ultrapure), and potassium acetate (ultrapure) were obtained from Sigma. HPLC-grade water and chloroform, as well asN-(trimethylsilyl)diethylamine, were from Aldrich. 7-Diethylamino-3-( ((2-maleimidyl) ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin (MDCC) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [γ-18O]ATP was synthesized as described previously (12Shukla K.K. Levy H.M. Ramirez F. Marecek J.F. Meyerson S. Kuhn E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11344-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the overall 18O enrichment was ∼95% and purity was >99%, as determined by HPLC analysis. S. cerevisiaetopoisomerase II was prepared as described (9Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); all topoisomerase II concentrations given are for the dimer. Phosphate release reactions were performed in HEPES reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 175 mm KOAc, and 10 mmMg(OAc)2), except where indicated. Oxygen exchange reactions were performed in Tris reaction buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm KOAc, and 10 mmMg(OAc)2). Exchange reactions were performed with 50 nm topoisomerase, 10 µm sheared salmon sperm DNA (base pairs), and 500 µm [γ-18O]ATP at room temperature in 1 ml of Tris reaction buffer. Tris was used instead of HEPES, as it did not significantly add to the ionic strength of the solution, which would interfere with subsequent Pi isolation. The reactions were allowed to proceed until ∼90% of the ATP had been hydrolyzed, as measured by the malachite green assay (13Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Similar final results were obtained when the reactions were stopped after 40% hydrolysis (data not shown). The control reactions contained 50 nmS1-myosin, 500 µm [γ-18O]ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. The reactions were stopped by vortexing with chloroform. Following extraction of the aqueous layer, Pi was isolated from each reaction using ion exchange chromatography (14Stempel K.E. Boyer B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 618-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reactions were diluted 10-fold (ionic strength ≤ 0.01) with HPLC-grade H2O, made basic by the addition of 1 ml of 1 m Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) and loaded onto a 0.5 × 3.0-cm AG1-X4 column (100–200-mesh, Cl− form, Bio-Rad). After the column was washed with 5 ml of H2O and 4 ml of 10 mm HCl, Piwas eluted with 10 ml of 30 mm HCl. The purified Pi samples were dried by lyophilization. Pi was converted to the TMS derivative as described (10Hackney D.D. Stempel K.E. Boyer P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 60-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and analyzed for 18O content by GC-MS. Briefly, the lyophilized samples were resuspended in 50 µl of glass-distilled CH2Cl2 and 5 µl ofN-(trimethylsilyl)diethylamine. The solution was shaken occasionally for at least 1 h at room temperature. The TMS-Pi samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using an Agilent (Wilmington, DE) model 5973 GC-MS. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a 15 m × 0.32 µm (inner diameter) DB-5 column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The column temperature was programmed from 70 °C to 275 °C at 15 °C/min. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. The injection port temperature was 200 °C, and the transfer line temperature was 280 °C. For the mass spectrometry analysis, positive chemical ionization was employed. The ion source temperature was 140 °C, and the reagent gas was methane. Selected ion monitoring analysis atm/z 315, 317, 319, and 321 was used to calculate the isotopic distribution of TMS-Pi. Corrections were made for the isotopic spillover due to the silicon in the TMS derivative of Pi (10Hackney D.D. Stempel K.E. Boyer P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 60-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The isotopic distribution in the original [γ-18O]ATP was determined by examining the18O distribution in the Pi produced by the Ca2+-ATPase activity of S1-myosin. S1-myosin in the presence of Ca2+ has been shown to hydrolyze ATP to ADP and Pi with the incorporation of only one water oxygen in the product Pi (15Levy H. Koshland D. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1102-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sleep J.A. Hackney D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5235-5238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observed 18O distributions in the product Pi were compared with those of the Ca-ATPase activity of S1-myosin, and theoretical distributions were calculated based on transition probability functions with a computer program kindly provided by David Hackney (Carnegie Mellon University). Pi release from topoisomerase II was measured using an assay developed by Webb and co-workers (11Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 17Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain ANCC75 transformed with a plasmid containing the A197C mutant phoSgene (pSN5182/7) was a kind gift of M. Webb (Medical Research Council, London, United Kingdom). The single cysteine mutant phosphate-binding protein (PBP) was expressed and purified as described (11Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 18Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Two liters of cells yielded 150 mg of PBP at a concentration of 170 µm as determined by absorbance at 280 nm (ε280 = 60,880 m−1cm−1). Protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen in 1-ml aliquots. Labeling of the single-cysteine containing PBP with MDCC and purification of the labeled protein were performed as described except that the “phosphate mop” included only PNPase and MEG. The 280/430 nm absorbance ratio of the final protein was 1.6, indicating that the majority of the PBP was labeled (11Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). When Pi was added to this preparation of PBP-MDCC, the emission maximum shifted from 475 nm to 467 nm and the fluorescence increased 6-fold. When Pi was titrated into 5 µmPBP-MDCC, the fluorescence responded linearly to 3.5–4.0 µm Pi, suggesting that 70–80% of the protein was active, labeled PBP. These measurements are in agreement with those reported previously (11Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Phosphate release kinetics were measured using a KinTek model SF-2001 stopped-flow apparatus with excitation at 425 nm through 4-nm slits. Emission was measured after a 450-nm cutoff long-wave pass filter (Corion, LL-450-F). Since PBP-MDCC is sensitive to nanomolar quantities of Pi, great care was taken to remove contaminating Pi from all solutions and glassware. In addition to using ultrapure chemicals and plastic vessels whenever possible, a coupled enzymatic phosphate mop was added to all solutions to remove contaminating Pi. This phosphate mop uses purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPase) with 7-methylguanosine (MEG) to sequester Pi as ribose 1-phosphate. Assay conditions were adjusted to ensure the phosphate mop did not compete with PBP-MDCC for phosphate (k cat/K m for the PNPase reaction with Pi is 3.2 × 106m−1 s−1); all reaction solutions contained 0.1 units/ml PNPase and 0.15 mm MEG. Prior to the experiment, the stopped flow was preincubated with a concentrated phosphate mop (0.5 units/ml PNPase, 0.5 mm MEG) in HEPES reaction buffer. Topoisomerase II (0.5 or 2 µm, as indicated) and PBP-MDCC (10 µm) in HEPES reaction buffer were loaded in one syringe. ATP (100–2000 µm) in the same buffer was placed in a second syringe. Where indicated, sheared salmon sperm DNA (400 base pairs/topoisomerase II dimer) was added to the topoisomerase II/PBP-MDCC solution. The relative change in fluorescence of PBP-MDCC as it bound Pireleased from the hydrolysis of ATP by topoisomerase II was measured. The traces shown were averaged from three time courses. To relate the relative change in fluorescence to concentration of Pireleased, the topoisomerase II/PBP-MDCC enzyme solution was mixed with excess KH2PO4 (200 µm). The fluorescence emission in volts at saturation was equated to the active concentration of PBP-MDCC. Pre-steady-state data were fit to Equation 1 describing a lag phase preceding a linear steady-state phase (19Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1995Crossref Google Scholar).""y=βα(t)+βα2[e−αt−1](Eq. 1) From the solutions of α and β in this equation, the duration of the lag phase (1/α) and the steady-state rate (β/α)t were calculated. The data were also fit by global analysis to the mechanism shown in Scheme 2 using the computer program DynaFit version 3.22.01 (BioKin Ltd, Madison, WI) (20Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Direct measurement of ATP synthesis by DNA topoisomerase II has not been successful, probably because of its complex reaction mechanism and high K d for Pi (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, the less direct method of18O exchange was used. This technique has been used to probe the mechanism of many ATPases and was instrumental for Boyer and colleagues (21Hutton R.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9990-9993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the binding-change mechanism of the F0F1 ATPase. ATP labeled with 18O at the γ-phosphate ([γ-18O]ATP) is incubated with the ATPase in buffer made from [16O]H2O. The initial hydrolysis of the [γ-18O]ATP results in the incorporation of one unlabeled, water-derived oxygen into the resulting Pi (see Scheme FS1for a simplified mechanism). If ATP is resynthesized on the enzyme before Pi is released, then the subsequent hydrolysis event will introduce another unlabeled oxygen into Pi with a certain probability. In Scheme FS1, E, S, and D represent topoisomerase II, ATP, and ADP, respectively. Although this is clearly a simplified scheme, showing binding and hydrolysis of only one ATP, it is adequate to describe the topoisomerase II reaction from the perspective of 18O exchange. The average number of unlabeled oxygens that appear in each Pi formed (16O/P ratio) is a function of the partitioning coefficient (Pc) (22Hackney D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5320-5328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partitioning coefficient is defined in Equation 2 (for rate constants, refer to Scheme FS1).""Pc=k−2k−2+k3(Eq. 2) Pc can also be described in terms of the average number of 16O in each Pi(16O/P) as shown in Equation 3 (21Hutton R.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9990-9993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 16O/P ratio can be calculated from the distribution of 18O species in the product phosphate analyzed by mass spectrometry. Therefore, one can determine the Pcexperimentally using Equation 3, and if k3 is known, the rate of ATP resynthesis (k −2) can be calculated using Equation 2.""Pc=((4×(16O/P))−4)3×(16O/P)(Eq. 3) A Pc approaching 1 would indicate that nearly all of the original 18O had been lost from the Pi as a result of many rounds of ATP hydrolysis and resynthesis prior to Pi release. This would occur if the rate of ATP resynthesis was much faster than the rate of Pirelease (k −2 ≫ k 3). A Pc of 0 indicates that all but one of the original 18O's remain on the Pi and ATP is not resynthesized on the enzyme before Pi is released. Intermediate Pc values give a predictable statistical distribution of [18O]Pi species containing 0–3 18O atoms per Pi (21Hutton R.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9990-9993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP hydrolysis/synthesis reaction of myosin has been well characterized using 18O exchange methods (12Shukla K.K. Levy H.M. Ramirez F. Marecek J.F. Meyerson S. Kuhn E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11344-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Levy H. Koshland D. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1102-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sleep J.A. Hackney D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5235-5238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of magnesium, myosin has a complex mechanism for ATP hydrolysis and synthesis that consists of an extensive exchange pathway with a Pc close to 1 and a non-exchange pathway with a Pc near 0. On the other hand, S1-myosin in the presence of calcium hydrolyzes ATP by a single nonexchanging pathway producing a near-zero Pc (15Levy H. Koshland D. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1102-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sleep J.A. Hackney D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5235-5238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ca2+/S1-myosin is known to incorporate only a single 16O into the product Pi, it is commonly used as a control in 18O exchange experiments. Additionally, the exchange results determined with Ca2+/S1-myosin are generally used to determine the starting distribution of 18O in the ATP substrate and to correct for the fact that the ATP is never completely or uniformly labeled (21Hutton R.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9990-9993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of 18O exchange during the hydrolysis of [γ-18O]ATP by topoisomerase II was compared with that of Ca2+/S1-myosin. Fig. 1shows the averaged results of three separate topoisomerase II/DNA and two separate Ca2+/S1-myosin experiments. A visual inspection of these data shows that topoisomerase II catalyzes only slightly more 18O exchange than Ca2+/S1-myosin. The Pc calculated from these data for topoisomerase II is 0.137. This result indicates that the rate of ATP resynthesis is slow relative to the rate of Pi release from the topoisomerase ATP active site. Essentially the same results were found when the ATPase reaction was performed in the absence of DNA (data not shown). The rate constant for ATP resynthesis could be estimated from the Pc value if the rate constant of Pi release were known. Therefore, the rates of Pi release were next measured. A sensitive fluorescent sensor for inorganic phosphate has been developed by Webb and colleagues (11Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 18Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The sensor is a labeled derivative of the E. coli phosphate-binding protein (PBP-MDCC). Pi binding to PBP-MDCC is rapid (1.36 × 108m−1 s−1) and tight (K d = 0.1 µm) and increases the fluorescence emission ∼5-fold at 470 nm (11Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Because of this tight and rapid binding, the kinetics and magnitude of observed fluorescence changes can be directly related to the rate and stoichiometry of Pi release from the examined ATPase. Fig. 2shows the changes in fluorescence with time as PBP-MDCC bound the Pi released from topoisomerase II. In these experiments the topoisomerase II was pre-bound to DNA. An initial lag in Pi release is observed under all ATP concentrations tested (50, 350, 500, and 1000 µm are shown). All four data sets are shown fit to Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”), an equation that describes a lag phase followed by a linear, steady-state phase. The initial lag in Pi release lasts 48–125 ms, depending on the ATP concentration and directly precedes a linear phase. The same reaction mixes were also analyzed for steady-state ATPase activity by a coupled spectrophotometric assay (23Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates estimated from the linear phase of Pi release approximate those calculated for the steady-state ATP hydrolysis. The K m for ATP under these reaction conditions is ∼130 µm, and a clear burst in ADP production is seen in rapid chemical quench studies when the initial ATP concentration exceeds 100 µm (8Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This burst in ADP production was shown previously to be caused by the rapid hydrolysis of one of the two bound ATP (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Results of experiments with the inhibitor vanadate and of experiments measuring the concentration of ADP bound to the enzyme during the first few turnovers suggest that the products of the first ATP hydrolysis dissociate prior to the second ATP hydrolysis event (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Release of either the first Pi or ADP formed was predicted to be the rate-determining step. The lag in Pi release presently seen indicates that the rate-determining step is indeed associated with Pi release. The rate-determining step could be a conformational change that occurs between ATP hydrolysis and Pi release. However, since there is no evidence for such a step, and inclusion of a conformational step does not change the analysis of the present data, the simplest mechanism of rate-determining Pi release is utilized. Therefore, the rate constant for Pi release can be estimated from the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis under conditions of saturating ATP. In the HEPES reaction buffer used for these studies, and all of the previous pre-steady state topoisomerase II experiments, the rate constant for Pi release is ∼4.6 s−1. Under the buffer conditions required for the 18O exchange experiments, the rate constant for Pi release is slightly lower (3 s−1). The anticancer drug etoposide inhibits DNA religation by topoisomerase II (24Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6157-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that etoposide also inhibits the ATPase reaction cycle sometime after hydrolysis of the first ATP, and before release of the second ADP (25Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Additionally, this drug does not block the rate of single turnover decatenation, but it does inhibit multiple turnover reactions (25Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30690-30696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to narrow down which step or steps in the ATPase reaction pathway are coupled to DNA religation, etoposide was included in a set of the Pi release assays (Fig. 3). The length of the lag phase was unaffected by the presence of saturating etoposide (71 ± 15 ms in the presence and 72 ± 11 ms in the absence of etoposide). The steady-state rate of Pi release was decreased 2-fold, as expected from previously reported steady-state studies. It appears that etoposide inhibits the ATPase reaction at a step after the release of the first Pi. It is therefore likely that Pirelease occurs prior to DNA religation in the overall reaction mechanism. In the absence of DNA, no lag or burst in Pi release from topoisomerase II is observed (Fig. 4). Pi release over time is linear and approximates the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis under the same conditions. Previous chemical quench results also showed that ADP was produced without a burst or lag by yeast topoisomerase II in the absence of DNA (8Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These data indicate that DNA binding either changes several rate constants or changes the entire mechanism of ATP hydrolysis of topoisomerase II. By combining the results of the 18O exchange and the Pi release experiments, a rate constant for ATP resynthesis at the topoisomerase II active site can be estimated. Using Equation 2, the determinedPc value of 0.137 and the approximate rate constant for Pi release in the Tris reaction buffer of 3 s−1, the rate constant for ATP resynthesis can be estimated as 0.5 s−1. These results indicate that topoisomerase II can resynthesize ATP, but with a much slower rate constant than for hydrolysis (∼40 s−1; Ref. 7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The graph shown in Fig.5illustrates the differences in18O exchange expected for an ATP resynthesis rate constant of 0.5 s−1 (Pc = 0.137) compared with one equal to the hydrolysis rate constant (40 s−1, Pc = 0.93); the experimental values for topoisomerase II are shown for comparison. The experimentally determined values for the number of 18O atoms per Pi are essentially identical to the theoretical distribution expected for a Pc value of 0.137. Utilizing the estimates for ATP resynthesis and Pi release rate constants determined above, combined with ATP binding and hydrolysis rate constants previously determined from rapid chemical quench and pulse-chase studies, the stopped-flow phosphate release data can be globally fit to the simplified mechanism shown in Scheme 2.""E+S+S⇌k−1k1ES+S→k1aESS⇌k−2k2ESDPi→k3ESD+Pi→k4E+2D+2PiSCHEME2In this scheme, E is topoisomerase II bound to DNA, S is ATP, and D is ADP. The second binding step is assumed to be essentially irreversible from results of previous pulse-chase experiments and the extremely slow dissociation rate of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The final two steps are shown as irreversible because the present reactions were analyzed under initial velocity conditions. The Pi release data from the topoisomerase II pre-bound to DNA at four different concentrations of ATP are shown globally fit to Scheme 2 in Fig. 6.

Open table in a new tab The combination of 18O exchange and Pirelease data presented indicates that the rate of ATP resynthesis on the DNA topoisomerase II active site is slow (k −2 ≈ 0.5 s−1). This result supports the sequential ATP hydrolysis mechanism proposed previously (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recall that yeast topoisomerase II was previously shown to hydrolyze ATP with a rapid burst. The amplitude of the burst always equaled half of the ATP active site concentration present. The enzyme preparations were known to be fully active from pulse-chase experiments. Therefore, the two possible explanations for the half-size burst amplitude were sequential hydrolysis of the two bound ATP, with the rate-determining step occurring between the first and second hydrolysis steps, or simultaneous hydrolysis of the two bound ATP with an ATP resynthesis rate equaling the hydrolysis rate (8Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although previously published experiments involving the inhibitor vanadate and heterodimeric mutant enzymes indicated that topoisomerase II does use a sequential hydrolysis mechanism, they did not directly address the rate of ATP resynthesis (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The very low level of 18O exchange detected, in relation to the rate constant for Pirelease, indicates that the rate of ATP resynthesis is much slower than the rate of hydrolysis. These finding are completely consistent with the sequential hydrolysis mechanism. Following ATP hydrolysis by topoisomerase II, Pirelease occurs with a lag. This indicates either that the release of Pi itself is slow or that Pi release occurs after a slow conformational change. Vanadate potently inhibits DNA topoisomerase II after hydrolysis of one ATP, blocking hydrolysis of the second (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We had previously interpreted these results to suggest that Pi release occurs rapidly, and the first ADP release is the rate-determining step. The present data clearly show that this interpretation was wrong. A simplified mechanism for vanadate inhibition is depicted in Scheme 3, whereE is topoisomerase II, S is ATP, D is ADP, and V is vanadate.""E+S+S⇌k−1k1ES+S→k1aESS⇌k−2k2ESDPi→k3ESD+Pi→k4E+2D+2Pi+V⥯ESDVSCHEME3Using the rate constants shown in Table I, the previously determined K i for vanadate of 4 µm (7Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the assumption that vanadate binds at close to the rate of diffusion, this mechanism was simulated (data not shown). Vanadate was found to potently inhibit the reaction, regardless of the fact that Pi release is slow. Therefore, the present data are fully consistent with those published previously. Nucleotide triphosphate binding and Pi release are thought to trigger or accompany the critical structural changes in the reaction cycles of myosins, kinesins, GTPases, and other NTP hydrolyzing proteins (26Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). The same may be true for DNA topoisomerase II. ATP binding is absolutely required for the dimerization of the ATPase domains and DNA transport (27Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 28Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A.

Although DNA transport is possible in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, it occurs much more slowly (9Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The rate constant for Pi release (4.6 s−1; see Table I) and DNA transport when ATP hydrolysis occurs (7 ± 1 s−1 ; Ref. 9Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by topoisomerase II are similar, and probably within error. Although DNA transport was not originally seen to occur with a lag, this could be due to the fact that few early times points were analyzed. When the DNA transport reactions were repeated using radioactively labeled catenanes such that small quantities of product could be accurately measured at short time points, a lag in transported product was detected. 2C. L. Baird and J. E. Lindsley, unpublished data. Therefore, it is plausible that Pi release triggers the conformational change required for DNA transport by topoisomerase II. However, the data are also consistent with DNA transport occurring just prior to Pi release. Although simplicity would suggest that the two events are coupled, a more complex mechanism cannot be ruled out at this time.

https://openalex.org/W2067053321,"The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) transactivates the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (ErbB1) to stimulate the cell migration of fibroblasts through an unknown mechanism (Li, J., Kim, Y. N. & Bertics, P. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 2951–2958). In this paper we provide evidence that the transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) by PDGFR is essential for PDGF to activate p21-activated kinase (PAK) family kinases. Fetal calf serum (10%) transiently stimulates the PAK activity in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

PDGF-induced activation of PAK is completely inhibited by either AG1295 or AG1478, indicating that PDGF requires both PDGFR and EGFR for PAK activation. In support of this notion, a mouse embryo fibroblast cell line derived from the EGFR −/− mouse (from Dr. Erwin Wagner) doesn't activate PAK in response to PDGF.

The PDGF receptor-specific inhibitor AG1295 and the ErbB1-specific inhibitor AG1478 were synthesized as described previously (10Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA: anti-PAK antibody, anti-EGFR antibody, anti-PDGF-β receptor antibodies, and anti-phospho-Tyr antibody. Anti-PDGF receptor antibodies were also purchased from PharMingen. Murine EGF was purified from mouse submaxillary glands in accordance with a published procedure (17Walker F. Burgess A.W. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Purified human PDGF was purchased from Calbiochem. To overexpress human EGFR in the EGFR-null mouse cell line EFE8–1, the cells were cotransfected with a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) carrying M2-tagged human EGFR cDNA (18Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J. et al.Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) and a second vector carrying puromycin-resistance selectable maker as described previously (16Maruta H.

Clones expressing EGFR (EGFR/EFE8–1) were selected by puromysin resistance and immunoblotting with anti-M2 (18Ullrich A. Coussens L.

Serum-starved NIH 3T3, EFE8–1, or EGFR/EFE8–1 cells were stimulated by 10% serum, EGF (100 ng/ml), or PDGF (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of AG1478 (0.2 µm), AG825 (0.8 µm), or AG1295 (1 µm) for specified times. Cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 100 µm NaVO3, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml aprotinin). The lysates containing 1 mg of protein (as measured by Bradford assay) were then immunoprecipitated with anti-PAK antibody (Santa Cruz), and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to the PAK kinase assay as described previously (2Obermeier A. Ahmed S. Manser E. et al.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3He H. Hirokawa Y. Manser E. Lim L. Levitzki A. Maruta H. Cancer J. (Boston). 2001; 7: 191-202PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed to determine the PAK protein level. Serum-starved EGFR/EFE8–1 cells were stimulated by either EGF (100 ng/ml) or PDGF (50 ng/ml) for 10 min in the presence or absence of either AG1478 (0.2 µm) or AG1295 (1 µm). Cell lysates containing 1.5 mg of protein (as measured by Bradford assay) were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated with either anti-EGF receptor (Santa Cruz) or anti-PDGFR antibodies (Santa Cruz) and protein A-Sepharose beads (13Li J. Kim Y.N. Bertics P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2951-2958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The proteins in immunoprecipitates were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations, Inc.). The membrane was blocked with 10% (w/v) skim milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-phospho-Tyr antibody (Santa Cruz). After washing with TBST, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). The bound antibodies were visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the amount of the receptors in the immunoprecipitates, the same membranes were stripped with 2% SDS and 100 mm dithiothreitol in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.4, for 30 min at 55 °C and washed with TBST. The blots were then reblotted with anti-EGFR or anti-PDGFR (PharMingen) antibodies. Within 10 min, fetal calf serum (10%) transiently activated PAK in serum-starved normal NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig.1 A). Under these conditions, no increase in PAK protein levels is detectable. To identify the signaling pathway(s) involved in serum-induced PAK activation, we examined the effects of the following three specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors: the PDGF receptor inhibitor AG1295 (10Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478 (10Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), and the ErbB2-specific inhibitor AG825 (10Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Either AG1295 (1 µm) or AG1478 (200 nm) inhibited completely the serum-induced PAK activation, whereas AG825 (800 nm) only partially inhibited the PAK activation (Fig.1 B). The particular concentrations of each inhibitor were chosen from published data (10Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), and our experiments demonstrated that the PAK kinase was not inhibited directly by any of these inhibitors (data not shown). These results indicated that serum-induced PAK activation required both PDGF receptor- and EGF receptor-dependent pathways. We resolved to determine whether serum-stimulated PAK activation involves PDGF receptor signaling transactivation of EGFR, which then requires ErbB2 in part to activate PAK, or EGF receptor signaling transactivation of PDGF receptor, which then requires ErbB2 in part to activate PAK. To clarify the above assumptions, we have examined the effects of PDGF and EGF on PAK activation separately. Like serum, PDGF (10 ng/ml) alone transiently activated PAK (Fig.2 A) as described previously (3He H. Hirokawa Y. Manser E. Lim L. Levitzki A. Maruta H. Cancer J. (Boston). 2001; 7: 191-202PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bokoch G. Wang Y. Bohl B. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25746-25749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The PDGF receptor inhibitor AG1295 (1 µm) blocked the PDGF-induced PAK activation (Fig. 2 B). Surprisingly, the ErbB1-specific inhibitor AG1478 also completely inhibited the PDGF-induced PAK activation at the concentration of 200 nm. The results suggest that PDGF requires EGFR, in addition to PDGF receptor, for PAK activation. Although EGF (100 ng/ml) also transiently stimulates PAK activity (Fig.3 A), the EGF-induced PAK activation was inhibited by AG1478 (Fig. 3 B). Clearly PDGF receptor activation is bypassed when EGF stimulates PAK activity. These observations strongly support our first hypothesis that PDGF receptor signaling transactivates EGFR. and they exclude the second hypothesis.Figure 3EGF does not require PDGFR to activate PAK. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated by EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time (A) or for 10 min in the presence or absence of either AG1478 (0.2 µm) or AG1295 (1 µm) (B). The cells lysates were subjected to PAK kinase assay as described in Fig. 1. The relative PAK kinase activity was calculated as -fold stimulation by EGF of the control PAK kinase activity. The values in the graph are the means ± S.D. obtained from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the complete inhibition of PDGF-induced PAK activation by the EGFR-specific inhibitor AG1478 (200 nm) strongly supports the notion that PDGF requires EGFR for PAK activation in NIH 3T3 cells, these experiments clearly do not exclude the possibility that this compound at the concentration used inhibits the function of other cellular protein(s), which happen to be essential for both EGFR- and PDGFR-induced PAK activation. Therefore, to explore further the notion that PDGF requires ErbB1 to activate PAK kinase, we used the embryonic fibroblast cell line (EFE8–1) derived from ErbB1-deficient (−/−) mice (14Sibilia M. Wagner E. Science. 1995; 269: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). There was no PAK activation by PDGF in EFE8–1 cells although PDGF receptor is activated and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.4 A). Expression of human EGF receptor in this cell line restored the ability of PDGF to activate PAK (Fig. 4 B). Again this response is inhibited by both AG1478 and AG1295 (Fig. 4 B). Clearly the EGF receptor is required for PDGF-induced PAK activation. Although EGF activates PAK in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 3), the EGFR levels in this cell line are very low (20Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I. Horsch K. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Using the method described, we were unable to detect EGFR protein or EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor (data not shown). However, in the EGFR/EFE8–1 cell line, PDGF clearly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (Fig.4 C). The results indicate that the PDGFR is active in these cells following exposure to PDGF and that PDGFR transactivates EGFR, which is responsible for PAK activation. However, it still remains to be clarified how PDGF receptor activates EGFR. In the present study, we have observed that PDGF activates PAK via EGF receptor, and the EGF receptor becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF treatment, suggesting that the transactivation of EGFR by PDGFR (11Collins M. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11689-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Walker F. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2746-2752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li J. Kim Y.N. Bertics P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2951-2958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is involved in PDGF-induced activation of PAK. PAK is required for normal cell motility and directed migration (21Kiosses W.B. Daniels H.R. Otey C. et al.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 22Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In particular PAK is required for PDGF-stimulated cell migration (23Dharmawardhane S. Schurmann A. Sells M., A. et al.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 11: 3341-3352Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 24Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. et al.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1256-1278Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). PDGF activates PAK, which then colocalizes with F-actin in lamelipodia and membrane ruffles, suggesting a role of PAK in directed cellular movement by regulating actin dynamics at the leading edge of cells. Recently it has been shown that PDGF-stimulated cell migration depends on the EGF receptor and that the EGF receptors become tyrosine-phosphorylated in respond to PDGF stimulation (13Li J. Kim Y.N. Bertics P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2951-2958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our observations in the present study. Why does PDGF rely on the EGF receptor to induce cell migration? Our present observation suggests that the EGF receptor is required for PDGF to activate PAK, which regulates actin dynamics and consequentially leads to cell migration. Like oncogenic RAS mutants, activation of the PDGF receptor directly activates PI3K (25Susa M. Keeler M. Varticovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22951-22956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn activates both CDC42 and Rac, which should lead to PAK activation (26Downward J. Maruta H. Kohama K. G Proteins, Cytoskeleton and Cancer. Landes Biosciences, Austin, TX1998: 171-183Google Scholar, 27Maruta H. He H. Tikoo A. Nheu T. Nur-E-Kamal M.S.A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. et al.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, this well characterized PI3K pathway alone does not appear to be sufficient for PAK activation. We have demonstrated here that the PDGF receptor requires the EGF receptor for PAK activation. The oncogenic RAS mutants such as v-Ha-RAS also require the activation of the EGF receptor (3He H. Hirokawa Y. Manser E. Lim L. Levitzki A. Maruta H. Cancer J. (Boston). 2001; 7: 191-202PubMed Google Scholar). Why do both PDGFR and oncogenic RAS require EGF receptor activation? Because both PDGFR and EGFR are able to recruit PAK to the plasma membranes through the SH2/SH3 protein NCK, which directly binds the N-terminal Pro-rich motif of PAK and the activated (Tyr-phosphorylated) PDGFR and EGFR (9Bokoch G. Wang Y. Bohl B. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25746-25749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Susa M. Keeler M. Varticovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22951-22956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Downward J. Maruta H. Kohama K. G Proteins, Cytoskeleton and Cancer. Landes Biosciences, Austin, TX1998: 171-183Google Scholar), it is unlikely that PDGFR requires EGFR for the NCK-binding per se. Interestingly, the Ras-induced PAK activation absolutely requires a member of Src family kinases (3He H. Hirokawa Y. Manser E. Lim L. Levitzki A. Maruta H. Cancer J. (Boston). 2001; 7: 191-202PubMed Google Scholar, 4He H. Hirokawa Y. Levitzki A. Maruta H. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 2000; 6: 243-248PubMed Google Scholar). Src family kinases tyrosine-phosphorylate the CAT (Cool-associatedtyrosine-phosphorylated protein) family proteins, which in turn bind to the SH3 family proteins called PIX/Cool (29Bagrodia S. Bailey D. Lenard Z. Hart M. Guan J.L. Premont R.T. Taylor S.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22393-22400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The SH3 family protein PIXs/Cools then bind with the N-terminal Pro-rich motif of PAK and stimulate PAK activity (30Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although both PDGFR and ErbB family kinases are known to activate Src family kinases (3He H. Hirokawa Y. Manser E. Lim L. Levitzki A. Maruta H. Cancer J. (Boston). 2001; 7: 191-202PubMed Google Scholar, 4He H. Hirokawa Y. Levitzki A. Maruta H. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 2000; 6: 243-248PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ralston R. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7845-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it still remains to be clarified whether the PDGFR-associated activation of PAK requires an ErbB kinase to activate Src family kinases. Because the sensitivity of PDGF-induced PAK activation to the three specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors is basically identical to that of the serum-induced one, it is likely that the dominant PAK-activating factors in serum are PDGF family ligands but not EGF family ligands for the following reasons. First, 200 nm AG1478 does not inhibit either the PDGF receptor or ErbB2 as the IC50 of AG1478 for both PDGF receptor and ErbB2 is higher than 100 µm (10Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Second, as the IC50 of AG1295 for both EGFR and ErbB2 is higher than 100 µm (10Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), 1 µm AG1295 does not inhibit ErbB family receptors. Finally, the IC50 of AG825 for EGF receptor and PDGF receptor are 20 and 40 µm, respectively (10Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar), again making it unlikely that 0.8 µm AG825 exerts any significant effect on these non-ErbB2 receptors. We are very grateful to Dr. Erwin Wagner for a generous gift of the mouse ErbB1-deficient (−/−) fibroblast cell line EFE8–1 and Dr. Calle Heldin for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2054631671,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae activates a regulatory network called “general control” that provides the cell with sufficient amounts of protein precursors during amino acid starvation. We investigated how starvation for nitrogen affects the general control regulatory system, because amino acid biosynthesis is part of nitrogen metabolism. Amino acid limitation results in the synthesis of the central transcription factor Gcn4p, which binds to specific DNA-binding motif sequences calledGcn4-protein-responsive elements (GCREs) that are present in the promoter regions of its target genes. Nitrogen starvation increases GCN4 transcription but efficiently represses expression of both a syntheticGCRE6::lacZ reporter gene and the natural amino acid biosynthetic gene ARO4. Repression of Gcn4p-regulated transcription by nitrogen starvation is independent of the ammonium sensing systems that include Mep2p and Gpa2p or Ure2p and Gln3p but depends on the four upstream open reading frames in theGCN4 mRNA leader sequence. Efficient translation ofGCN4 mRNA is completely blocked by nitrogen starvation, even when cells are simultaneously starved for amino acids and eukaryotic initiation factor-2α is fully phosphorylated by Gcn2p. Our data suggest that nitrogen starvation regulates translation ofGCN4 by a novel mechanism that involves the four upstream open reading frames but that still acts independently of eukaryotic initiation factor-2α phosphorylation by Gcn2p.

Whereas some target genes are regulated via several GCREs in their promoter regions likeHIS3 or TRP4, for example (7Braus G. Mösch H.-U. Vogel K. Hinnen A. Hutter R.

Paravicini G. Egli C.M. Irniger S. Braus G.H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 113: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The best understood regulatory mechanism of Gcn4p expression is translational control of its mRNA, which requires four smallupstream open readingframes (uORFs) present in the GCN45′-untranslated region (12Hinnebusch A.G.

A. 1984; 81: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When cells are growing under non-starvation conditions, ribosomes translate the first uORF, reinitiate at uORFs 2–4, and are unable to recognize theGCN4 start codon (14Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In cells starved for amino acids, ribosomes that have translated the first uORF reinitiate at theGCN4 translational start site leading to high expression of Gcn4p. Inactivation of the four uORFs in the GCN4 leader by either deletion or mutation of the four ATG start codons uncouples translational control of GCN4 from the general control system, leading to high expression of Gcn4p already under non-starvation conditions (15Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).

Under amino acid starvation conditions, Gcn2p detects uncharged tRNAs and in response phosphorylates the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). Phosphorylated eIF-2 inhibits translation of most mRNAs mediated by the inhibition of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF-2B. This allows ribosomes to scan past the remaining uORFs in the GCN4 5′-untranslated region and translate the mRNA of the GCN4 gene (18Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F.

Ammonium is among the inorganic nitrogen sources in nature that support optimal growth of yeast cells (20Wiame J.M. Grenson M. Arst Jr., H.N. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1985; 26: 1-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Three ammonium permeases, Mep1p, Mep2p, and Mep3p, are known that control uptake of ammonium into the cytoplasm (21Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Deletion of all three MEPgenes renders yeast cells inviable on media containing less than 5 mm ammonium sulfate as the sole nitrogen source. In addition to its functions as ammonium permease, Mep2p is thought to act as an ammonium sensor protein in a signaling system that controls pseudohyphal development of diploid Σ1278bstrains, because diploid mep2Δ mutant strains are unable to form pseudohyphae in response to nitrogen starvation. Pseudohyphal development of mep2Δ mutants can be restored by expression of dominant activated forms of Gpa2p or Ras2p, GTP-binding proteins that both regulate intracellular cAMP levels (22Kübler E. Mösch H.-U. Rupp S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20321-20323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have led to the model that Mep2p is a central ammonium sensor protein that activates Gpa2p and cAMP-dependent protein kinase in response to nitrogen starvation. The proteins Ure2p and Gln3p are two additional important regulators in the ammonium utilization pathway and are required under all conditions (24ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A. Verrips C.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).As amino acid biosynthesis is part of the general nitrogen metabolism in yeast, we investigated how starvation for nitrogen affects the general control system of amino acids. We found that deprivation of a suitable nitrogen source efficiently counteracts the activation of Gcn4p-controlled gene expression. Expression of a syntheticGCRE6::lacZ reporter gene and natural amino acid biosynthetic genes such as ARO4 is suppressed when cells are starved for nitrogen, whereas starvation for glucose has only minor effects on Gcn4p-controlled gene expression. We findGCRE-mediated repression although the mRNA level ofGCN4 strongly increases, suggesting that nitrogen starvation specifically suppresses translation of GCN4. The four intact uORFs in the GCN4 mRNA leader sequence are necessary components for the repression mechanism, whereas eIF-2α phosphorylation, the ammonium sensing system that includes Mep2p or Gpa2p, and the proteins Ure2p or Gln3p are not required.DISCUSSIONYeast cells integrate many nutritional signals to adapt their metabolism for optimal growth and development. Nitrogen starvation requires the expression of genes for enzymes able to degrade nitrogen-containing compounds. Simultaneously, cells adapt morphologically by switching to a filamentous growth mode. In this study, we investigated how starvation for nitrogen affects the “general control” regulatory network that induces amino acid biosynthetic gene expression when yeast cells are starved for amino acids. Because amino acid biosynthesis requires at least one aminotransferase reaction, this network is an important part of the general nitrogen metabolism. Yeast cells utilize ammonia exclusively by incorporation into glutamate and glutamine (24ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A. Verrips C.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This prompted us to analyze whether the general signal “lack of nitrogen” includes the more specific signal “lack of amino acid” and subsequently activates the general control system and its transcriptional activator Gcn4p. In contrast, we found the opposite effect that a general lack of any nitrogen source specifically and efficiently inhibits Gcn4p-mediated gene expression.Several lines of evidence indicate that inhibition of general control-regulated gene expression by nitrogen starvation occurs at the level of GCN4 mRNA translation. (i) We find that Gcn4 protein levels decrease in the absence of nitrogen, whereasGCN4 transcript levels increase. (ii) Reduction of Gcn4p levels or GCN4::lacZ fusion expression can been observed only when translated from GCN4 mRNA species carrying the uORFs in the leader sequence. (iii) Nitrogen starvation completely blocks amino acid starvation-dependent induction ofGCN4::lacZ expression and subsequently increased Gcn4p levels, depending on the presence of the uORFs. However, phosphorylation of eIF-2α by Gcn2p is not blocked by nitrogen starvation. To the contrary, we find that nitrogen starvation leads to an even stronger increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation than amino acid starvation. Yet starvation for nitrogen completely blocks efficient translation of GCN4 mRNA, even under simultaneous amino acid starvation conditions. This suggests that nitrogen starvation blocks GCN4 mRNA translation by an additional yet undiscovered mechanism. Because nitrogen starvation does not affect Gcn2p or eIF-2α protein levels nor the ratio of eIF-2α∼P/eIF-2α, a component of the general control system that acts downstream of eIF-2α might be altered in function or expression. This result indicates an additional translational regulation mechanism using the same cis-elements.Our study further suggests that nitrogen starvation, apart from repressing translation of GCN4 mRNA, also down-regulates the Gcn4 protein on a posttranslational level. This conclusion is based on two observations. (i) Whereas in the absence of GCN2 expression ofGCN4::lacZ is not repressible by nitrogen starvation, expression of theGCRE6::lacZ reporter is still down-regulated to a certain extent. (ii) When uORFs are absent in theGCN4 leader, expression ofGCN4m::lacZ (reflecting translation ofGCN4) is induced 2-fold by nitrogen starvation, but both Gcn4 protein levels and expression of theGCRE6::lacZ reporter are not further induced. A simple explanation might be that nitrogen starvation reduces Gcn4 protein stability. Whereas amino acid starvation inhibits Gcn4p degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic system (45Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), nitrogen starvation might have opposite effects and activate proteolysis of Gcn4p.A nitrogen sensing and signaling system has to induce translational repression of GCN4. At least two distinct developmental programs are known that are negatively regulated by the presence of ammonium, pseudohyphal development, and meiosis. A signaling system that consists of Mep2p, Gpa2p, and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is thought to regulate positively pseudohyphal development when cells are starved for nitrogen (22Kübler E. Mösch H.-U. Rupp S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20321-20323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 46Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1443-1457PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither Mep2p nor Gpa2p seems to be involved in translational control of GCN4. In the presence of ammonium, yeast turns off the utilization of poor nitrogen sources, such as urea and proline. This phenomenon is referred as nitrogen catabolite repression (47Hofman-Bang J. Mol. Biotechnol. 1999; 12: 35-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The genetic system involves the function of the positively acting GATA transcription factor Gln3p that is negatively regulated by the repressor protein Ure2p in the presence of ammonium. However, neitherure2Δ nor gln3Δ strains show effects which indicate that these proteins are involved in GCN4 repression under nitrogen starvation. The reduction of the intracellular ammonium concentration by deleting the ammonium permeases MEP1 andMEP2 led to a decrease of Gcn4p activity. This suggests the existence of an additional sensor system for the intracellular ammonium concentration, which is able to induce a signal for repression of theGCN4 mRNA translation.In summary, our studies show that yeast cells up-regulate amino acid biosynthesis only when enough nitrogen-containing precursors are available. Nitrogen starvation specifically represses activity of the general control system but does not affect the basal expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes. This demonstrates that amino acid biosynthesis is not completely shut down even under severe starvation conditions. The importance of amino acid biosynthesis under nutrient limiting conditions is also reflected by the regulatory mechanism that we found in this study. Although yeast cells abrogate up-regulation of amino acid biosynthesis when nitrogen sources are absent, mRNA levels for the transcriptional activator Gcn4p are kept at a higher level in order to rapidly induce translation of GCN4mRNA when nitrogen becomes available. In bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, starvation for a single amino acid induces the transcription of more than 50 genes encoding enzymes involved in several amino acid biosynthetic pathways, amino acid tRNA synthetases (1Meussdoerffer F. Fink G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mirande M. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18443-18451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or enzymes of purine biosynthesis (3Mösch H.-U. Scheier B. Lahti R. Mantsala P. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20453-20460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This genetic system is called “general control of amino acid biosynthesis” (4Hinnebusch A.G. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R.

Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), which binds to specificGcn4-protein-responsive elements (GCREs)1 present in the promoter regions of its target genes. Gcn4p stimulates transcription of its target genes by a factor of 2–10 (6Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1986; 46: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Whereas some target genes are regulated via several GCREs in their promoter regions likeHIS3 or TRP4, for example (7Braus G. Mösch H.-U. Vogel K. Hinnen A. Hutter R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Hill D.E. Hope I.A. Macke J.P. Struhl K. Science. 1986; 234: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9Hope I.A.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2951-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), others contain only a single GCRE site that is both essential and sufficient for regulation by Gcn4p as found for the ARO4 gene (11Künzler M. Paravicini G. Egli C.M. Irniger S. Braus G.H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 113: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The best understood regulatory mechanism of Gcn4p expression is translational control of its mRNA, which requires four smallupstream open readingframes (uORFs) present in the GCN45′-untranslated region (12Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Thireos G. Penn M.D. Greer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When cells are growing under non-starvation conditions, ribosomes translate the first uORF, reinitiate at uORFs 2–4, and are unable to recognize theGCN4 start codon (14Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In cells starved for amino acids, ribosomes that have translated the first uORF reinitiate at theGCN4 translational start site leading to high expression of Gcn4p. Inactivation of the four uORFs in the GCN4 leader by either deletion or mutation of the four ATG start codons uncouples translational control of GCN4 from the general control system, leading to high expression of Gcn4p already under non-starvation conditions (15Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Translational regulation ofGCN4 depends on the sensor kinase Gcn2p, which includes an N-terminal protein kinase domain and a C-terminal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase-like domain (16Roussou I. Thireos G. Hauge B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2132-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2030971672,"The Drosophila S3 ribosomal protein has important roles in both protein translation and DNA repair. In regards to the latter activity, it has been shown that S3 contains vigorous N-glycosylase activity for the removal of 8-oxoguanine residues in DNA that leaves baseless sites in their places. Drosophila S3 also possesses an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity in which the enzyme catalyzes a β-elimination reaction that cleaves phosphodiester bonds 3′ and adjacent to an AP lesion in DNA. In certain situations, this is followed by a δ-elimination reaction that ultimately leads to the formation of a single nucleotide gap in DNA bordered by 5′- and 3′-phosphate groups. The human S3 protein, although 80% identical to its Drosophila homolog and shorter by only two amino acids, has only marginal N-glycosylase activity. Its lyase activity only cleaves AP DNA by a β-elimination reaction, thus further distinguishing itself from the Drosophila S3 protein in lacking a δ-elimination activity. Using a hidden Markov model analysis based on the crystal structures of several DNA repair proteins, the enzymatic differences between Drosophila and human S3 were suggested by the absence of a conserved glutamine residue in human S3 that usually resides at the cleft of the deduced active site pocket of DNA glycosylases. Here we show that the replacement of the Drosophila glutamine by an alanine residue leads to the complete loss of glycosylase activity. Unexpectedly, the δ-elimination reaction at AP sites was also abrogated by a change in the Drosophila glutamine residue. Thus, a single amino acid change converted the Drosophila activity into one that is similar to that possessed by the human S3 protein. In support of this were experiments executed in vivo that showed that human S3 and the Drosophila site-directed glutamine-changed S3 performed poorly when compared with Drosophilawild-type S3 and its ability to protect a bacterial mutant from the harmful effects of DNA-damaging agents. The Drosophila S3 ribosomal protein has important roles in both protein translation and DNA repair. In regards to the latter activity, it has been shown that S3 contains vigorous N-glycosylase activity for the removal of 8-oxoguanine residues in DNA that leaves baseless sites in their places. Drosophila S3 also possesses an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity in which the enzyme catalyzes a β-elimination reaction that cleaves phosphodiester bonds 3′ and adjacent to an AP lesion in DNA. In certain situations, this is followed by a δ-elimination reaction that ultimately leads to the formation of a single nucleotide gap in DNA bordered by 5′- and 3′-phosphate groups. The human S3 protein, although 80% identical to its Drosophila homolog and shorter by only two amino acids, has only marginal N-glycosylase activity. Its lyase activity only cleaves AP DNA by a β-elimination reaction, thus further distinguishing itself from the Drosophila S3 protein in lacking a δ-elimination activity.

Beyond the internal cellular production of reactive oxygen species, the burden of free radical attack on cellular DNA is increased through exposure to ionizing radiation (1Hutchinson F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1985; 32: 115-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), cigarette tar and smoke (2Borish E.T. Cosgrove J.P. Church D.F. Deutsch W.A. Pryor W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the recently discovered presence of stable free radicals associated with particulate matter generated by combustion (3Dellinger B. Pryor W.A. Cueto R. Squadrito G.L. Deutsch W.A. Proceedings of the Combustion Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland, July 30–August 4, 2000. 28. The Combustion Institute, Pittsburgh, PA2000: 2675-2681Google Scholar). The impact that free radicals have on DNA is varied and profound. For example, single- and double-strand breaks, along with the production of baseless sites in DNA, are a common result of free radical damage to DNA (4Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). Oxidatively damaged DNA bases also result from the presence of free radicals; the most notable of such bases is 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). This lesion frequently mispairs with adenine, resulting in G:C → T:A transversion mutations (5Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) that are exceedingly common in somatic mutations found in human cancers and, importantly, are abundant in the tumor suppressor genep53 (6Hollstein M. Shomer B. Greenblatt M. Soussi T. Hovig E. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The formation of oxidative damage to DNA is subject to repair by the base excision repair pathway, which exists as a ubiquitous collection of enzymes that involves the removal of altered bases, followed by several steps to return the damaged DNA to its original state. The liberation of oxidatively damaged DNA bases is the initial step in this process, which is catalyzed by an N-glycosylase that cleaves the glycosylic bond between the sugar and damaged base, resulting in an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)1site. For most prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes that act on 8-oxoG, the glycosylase step is followed by a β-elimination lyase reaction that results in a 3′-phosphodiester cleavage adjacent to the AP site. Mechanistically, the coupling of these two activities has been thought to be mediated through an ε-amine nucleophile of lysine that attacks the C-1′ of the damaged nucleotide sugar (7Thayer M.H. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 8Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Karvate J. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S.

This results in the loss of the base and the formation of a covalent attachment of the enzyme to the 2′-deoxyribose sugar moiety of the abasic site, forming an imine (Schiff) base intermediate that can conveniently be trappedin vitro by sodium borohydride (11Dodson M.L. Michaels M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a Schiff base is followed by abstraction of the 2′-H and cleavage of the 3′-C–O bond through an elimination reaction (12Kow Y.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3280-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Manoharan M. Mazumder A. Ransom S.C. Gerlt J.A. Bolton P.H. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1989; 111: 8029-8030Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In yeast and humans, the ε-amine group of lysine occupies a place in a helix-hairpin-helix-GPD domain considered critical for non-sequence-specific binding to DNA (see Fig. 1). Also within this active site pocket domain are an aspartic acid residue that is also essential for catalysis and a glutamine residue that resides at the mouth of the active site pocket and is believed to be involved in nucleotide flipping. For Drosophila S3 (15Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), Escherichia coliformamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (mutM) (16Bhagwat M. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and T4 UV endonuclease (11Dodson M.L. Michaels M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Latham K.A. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8796-8803Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the β-elimination reaction is followed by a δ-elimination reaction that results in a one-nucleotide gap bordered by a 3′-P, 5′-P terminus. The formamidopyrimidine protein is an example of an enzyme that efficiently removes 8-oxoG through a concertedN-glycosylase/β-δ activity. Conversely, theDrosophila S3 and T4 UV endonuclease V activities appear to carry out a δ-elimination reaction through a second encounter with an abasic DNA substrate. In Drosophila, two genes have been identified that are involved in the removal of 8-oxoG (15Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Dherin C. Dizdaroglu M. Doerflinger H. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), one being the aforementioned S3 that is involved in both protein translation and the removal of 8-oxoG from DNA. Studies on the human S3 show that, even though it is 80% identical to the Drosophila protein and only two amino acids shorter, it catalyzes an entirely different enzymatic reaction. For example, human S3 acts primarily on heavily UV-irradiated DNA, and it catalyzes only a single β-elimination reaction at abasic sites residing in DNA (19Kim J. Chubatsu L.S. Admon A. Stahl J. Fellows R. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13620-13629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The human S3 protein, unlike Drosophila S3, is extremely inefficient in removing 8-oxoG from oxidatively damaged DNA. Based on previous studies, S3 appeared to be an orphan among other eukaryotic 8-oxoG DNA glycosylases. However, hidden Markov model-based analysis suggested structural similarity between the S3 sequence family and, among others, the E. coli repair proteins endonuclease III (7Thayer M.H. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 20Kuo C.F. McRee D.E. Fisher C.L. O'Handley S.F. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Science. 1992; 258: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), MutY (21Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct.

Fujii Y. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Fujii S. Cell. 1996; 86: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both Drosophilaand human S3 possess conserved amino acids noted above and known to be important for substrate binding and/or catalysis (Fig.1). One obvious difference between the human and Drosophila S3 protein revealed by this analysis, however, was a glutamine residue (Fig. 2) that rests at the cleft of the deduced active site pocket (Fig. 1) and is considered important for the “flipping out” of the modified base (24Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the absence in human S3 of this glutamine residue and its marginal N-glycosylase activity for the removal of 8-oxoG might be linked to one another and that they therefore offered an excellent model for testing the importance of this amino acid in performing the N-glycosylase step in base excision repair. We therefore changed, by site-directed mutagenesis, the glutamine residue for Drosophila S3. As predicted from our hidden Markov analysis, a change in glutamine results in the loss of N-glycosylase activity. Oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoguanine and uracil were purchased from Operon Technologies and Midland Certified Reagent Co., respectively. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the pGEX3X vector was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Glutathione-agarose and sodium borohydride were purchased from Sigma; aprotinin and leupeptin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA-damaging agents MMS and hydrogen peroxide were from Fluka and Mallinckrodt, respectively. E. coliuracil DNA glycosylase was purchased from Epicentre (Madison, WI). The Drosophilaribosomal protein S3 gene was mutated at Gln-59 to Ala and Gln-59 to Asn using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The mutagenic primer sets used for Q59A and Q59N were 5′-GGCCACCAAGACCCAGGAGGTGCTGGGCGAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTCTCGCCCAGCACCGCCTGGGTCTTGGTGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCACCAAGACCCAGANCGTGCTGGGCGAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTCTCGCCCAGCACGTTCTGGGTCTTGGTGGCC-3′, respectively. The S3 gene in pGEX3 was used as the template. The colonies containing plasmids with desired mutations were picked, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. AB1157 and its derivative RPC501 nfo-1::kanΔ(xth-pncA) 90 (25) were used in the studies described here and elsewhere (15Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) for the characterization of S3. Overnight bacterial cultures of RPC501 transformed with Drosophila GST-S3, human GST-S3, andDrosophila mutants GST-S3Q59A and GST-S3Q59N were diluted in pre-warmed LB+ampicilin media to an A 595of 0.1 and grown at 37 °C until cultures reached anA 595 of 0.5; then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and growth continued for 3 h at 27 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 µg/ml aprotinin and 10 µg/ml leupeptin. Bacteria were sonicated three times at 15-s intervals with constant pulse, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The soluble supernatant was then applied to a glutathione-agarose affinity column and washed with 10 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, and the fusion construct was eluted (1-ml fractions) with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. This resulted in a homogeneous preparation of fusion construct, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. A 37-base pair 5′ 32P end-labeled duplex DNA fragment (5′-CTT GGA CTG GAT GTC GGC ACX AGC GGA TAC AGG AGC A-3′, whereX = 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG 37-mer) or uracil at nucleotide position 21 (labeled strand)) was used as a substrate either directly or treated (20 pmol) with E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase (2 units) to form an AP site in place of the uracil (26Lindahl T. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following phenol/chloroform extraction, the AP site-containing oligonucleotide (AP 37-mer) was precipitated with cold ethanol. Reaction mixtures (10 µl) contained ∼1 pmol of 5′ end-labeled 37-mer; in addition, reactions for GST-S3 contained 30 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The DNA reaction products were separated on a 16% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography for visualization and densitometric analysis (ChemiImagerTM 4000, Alpha Innotech Corporation). Overnight cultures of AB1157, RPC501, and RPC501 transformed with Drosophila GST-S3, human GST-S3, and Drosophila mutants GST-S3Q59A and GST-S3Q59N were diluted to an A 595 of 0.1 and grown at 37 °C to an A 595 of 0.5, at which time isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was added, and growth was allowed to continue for an additional 3 h at 27 °C. The cultures were normalized to anA 595 of 1, and serial dilutions were applied as spots (20 µl) to untreated and MMS- and H2O2-treated LB agar plates. The fusion proteins (10 pmol) were combined with NaBH4 (30 mm) and immediately transferred to reaction mixtures containing 20 pmol of 8-oxoG or AP 37-mer, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, and Triton X-100. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Incubations were terminated with the addition of DNA loading dye, and samples were loaded on a 10% non-denaturing gel. After electrophoresis, gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to autoradiography. An iterative procedure for hidden Markov model-based analysis of protein sequence families was employed (27Mian I.S. Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. J. Comput. Biol. 1998; 5: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The training set for the domain 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase hidden Markov model consisted of bacterial, archaeal, organellar, and eukaryotic S3s together with bacterial endonuclease III, mutY, and 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase. Model training and analysis were performed using the Sequence Alignment and Modeling suite of programs. Figures for the hidden Markov model-generated alignment and ribbon diagram were generated using ALSCRIPT (28Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the structural equivalent ofE. coli endonuclease III Gln-41 is Gln-59. To examine the possible role of Gln-59 in the removal of 8-oxoG, we mutated the residue to Ala or Asn. The site-directed Drosophila mutants were subsequently placed in pGEX3X for overexpression and purification in a bacterial strain defective for AP endonuclease activity (RPC501) (25Cunningham R.P. Saporito S.M. Spitizer S.G. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final purification product resulted in apparently homogenous GST fusion construct protein preparations (as judged by Coomassie staining) that had molecular weights identical to that for the wild-type Drosophila GST-S3 protein (data not shown). Tests for 8-oxoG activity were then performed on a 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide containing a single 8-oxoG residue at position 21 (15). Results show that a change from a Gln residue to an Ala amino acid completely abolished N-glycosylase activity (Fig.3 A, lanes 5–7 as compared with lanes 9–11, respectively). A more conservative substitution with an Asn residue (lanes 1–3) also failed to show activity except at higher protein concentrations. Notably, these site-directed changes resemble the activity possessed by wild-type human S3 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–7), in which little if any activity is observed on 8-oxoG residues. We next tested what effect the change at Gln-59 had on the ability ofDrosophila S3 to act on an abasic site existing in a 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide. Surprisingly, the Gln to Ala change resulted in the Drosophila protein catalyzing a single β-elimination reaction (Fig.4 A, lanes 9–11). This is in contrast to the wild-type Drosophila S3 activity that carries out a β-δ-elimination reaction (Fig.4 A, lanes 5–7) but is similar to that observed for the human S3 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and6), which, like the Drosophila Gln to Ala change, catalyzes a single β-elimination reaction. When theDrosophila Gln residue was changed to an Asn residue (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–3), activity appeared on the abasic substrate that was greater than that observed for the change to Ala but nevertheless appeared to lack δ-elimination activity under the enzymatic conditions employed. Multiple bands were, however, observed using the Gln to Asn change. When reaction conditions were chosen in which there was an excess amount of protein (2 pmol), these multiple products appeared to be entirely driven into a δ-elimination product (Fig. 5, A and B,lane 4). Excess amounts of dS3Q59A, on the other hand, still failed to act on 8-oxoG (Fig. 5 A, lane 3) and generated but a single β-elimination product when acting on the abasic-containing DNA substrate (Fig. 5 B, lane 3). It should be noted that the β-elimination product generated by dS3Q59A was susceptible to δ-cleavage by wild-typeDrosophila GST-S3 (data not shown), suggesting that absence of this activity in the mutant was not due to it somehow masking the site from cleavage.Figure 5Activity of saturating amounts of GST-dS3, GST-dS3Q59A, GST-dS3Q59N, and GST-hS3 on 8-oxoG-containing DNA and AP site-containing DNA. A, 1 pmol of 8-oxoG 37-mer was incubated with 2 pmol of GST-dS3 (lane 1), GST-hS3 (lane 2), GST-dS3Q59A (lane 3), and GST-dS3Q59N (lane 4). B, 1 pmol of abasic site-containing DNA was incubated with 2 pmol of GST-dS3 (lane 1), GST-hS3 (lane 2), GST-dS3Q59A (lane 3), and GST-dS3Q59N (lane 4). The results presented are representative of four independent trials.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A characteristic of virtually all N-glycosylase/AP lyases is that they form an imine intermediate that can be trapped by sodium borohydride (29Dizdaroglu M. Zastawny T.H. Carmical J.R. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we tested whether the lack ofN-glycosylase activity exhibited by the Gln to Ala change could be traced to an inability of the mutant to bind to pre-existing 8-oxoG or AP sites in synthetic oligonucleotides. As expected, an electromobility shift assay showed that the Drosophila S3 protein containing a Gln to Ala change failed to bind the 8-oxoG DNA substrate (Fig. 6 A, lane 4). It also lacked DNA binding activity for an oligonucleotide containing an abasic site (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). Surprisingly, the more conservative change to an Asn residue resulted in the retention of significant DNA binding activity to both DNA substrates (Fig. 6, A, lane 5 andB, lane 4), even though its catalytic activity toward these DNA substrates is severely compromised (Figs. 3 and 4). Notably, human S3 was found to efficiently bind a substrate containing 8-oxoG (Fig. 6, lane 3), although it lacks the catalytic activity to liberate this base from DNA. An important test for substantiating our in vitro observations was whether they could be reproduced in an in vivo setting where the individual mutants were challenged to rescue bacterial cells from known DNA-damaging agents. We utilized a bacterial strain, RPC501, that is severely compromised in its ability to repair DNA damage produced by exposure to MMS and hydrogen peroxide (15Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which predominantly produce abasic and oxidatively damaged sites in DNA, respectively. Wild-type AB1157 cells and RPC501 cells alone or RPC501 containing the genes shown in Fig. 7 were grown to mid-log phase, at which time isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was introduced. After 3 h, the cells were normalized and then serially diluted onto plates containing MMS (2 mm) or hydrogen peroxide (0.25 mm). Exposure to MMS showed that RPC501 harboring human S3 was extremely sensitive to the effects of this DNA-damaging agent. Both the Gln to Ala and Gln to Asn mutants ofDrosophila S3 also showed sensitivity to MMS when compared with RPC501 containing the wild-type S3 gene. Perhaps most revealing were the effects that hydrogen peroxide had on RPC501 harboring the genes depicted in Fig. 7, in which the Gln to Ala change was slightly less protective than the Gln to Asn mutant, which supports our in vitro observations that the asparagine change is not as deleterious as a change to alanine. The human S3 appears to be the least capable of protecting cells from the DNA-damaging effects of both MMS and hydrogen peroxide. The Drosophila S3 gene and its encoded protein were first characterized by our group because of its highly unusual behavior in human cells. For example, in examining the presence of AP endonucleases in human cells, Kane and Linn (30Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3405-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found two species that could be resolved by separation on phosphocellulose chromatography, one of which was retained and subsequently determined to be not only the major AP endonuclease in human cells but also a protein later found for controlling the redox status of a number of important transcription factors such as Fos and Jun (31Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The other AP endonuclease characterized by Linn and co-workers (32Kuhnlein U. Penhoet E.E. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) flowed through phosphocellulose and was subsequently found to be lacking in cell lines of xeroderma pigmentosum group-D fibroblasts. This protein was later purified to homogeneity and found to be ribosomal protein S3 (19Kim J. Chubatsu L.S. Admon A. Stahl J. Fellows R. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13620-13629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although the human S3 gene is not defective in xeroderma pigmentosum-D, its expression nevertheless seems to have a curious relationship with other human diseases. For example, it is overexpressed in human colorectal cancers (33Pogue-Geile K. Geiser J.R. Shu M. Miller C. Wool I.G. Meisler A.I. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, in attempts to clone genes defective for Fanconi's anemia and its sensitivity to MMC, the S3 gene was commonly found to complement the MMC sensitivity. The biochemical characterization of human S3 showed that it acted on AP sites and on DNA that was heavily exposed to UV irradiation, by creating a phosphodiester break between adjacent thymine residues in a pyrimidine dimer configuration (19Kim J. Chubatsu L.S. Admon A. Stahl J. Fellows R. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13620-13629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Drosophila S3 has been found to be a much more versatile enzyme than its human counterpart. For example, it has vigorousN-glycosylase activity for the removal of 8-oxoG residues in DNA that human S3 lacks (15Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 34Deutsch W.A. Yacoub A. Jaruga P. Zastawny T.H. Dizdaroglu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32857-32860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It also has a novel deoxyribophosphodiesterase activity (35Sandigursky M. Yacoub A. Kelley M.R. Deutsch W.A. Franklin W.A. J. Biol.

Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Conner T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human β-DNA polymerase (37Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Notably, DrosophilaS3 has also been shown to hydrolytically catalyze the removal of a 3′-AP site (35Sandigursky M. Yacoub A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17480-17484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting for the first time that an AP lyase can be an efficient catalyst for the priming of a single nucleotide insertion into a site generated by a DNA repair protein. Although both human and Drosophila S3 exhibit DNA repair activities, neither had any obvious sequence similarity to eukaryotic and bacterial genes known to be involved in base excision repair. However, hidden Markov model-based analysis indicated similarity between the S3 family and other proteins possessing an 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase domain, most notably E. coli endonuclease III, MutY, and 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase. Especially relevant to our studies was the information available through the generation of crystal structures of the aforementionedE. coli DNA repair proteins that aided in identifying those amino acids suspected to be involved in the N-glycosylase step. Recall that human S3 lacks the ability to remove 8-oxoG, whereasDrosophila S3 possesses the exceptional ability to remove this lesion and at catalytic rates comparable with other eukaryotic and prokaryotic 8-oxoG DNA glycosylases (15Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Examination of an S3/8-oxoG DNA glycosylase multiple sequence alignment in the context of known 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase domain structures pinpointed one possible reason for this difference, which was a glutamine residue proposed from other studies to be important for the flipping out of a modified or nonconventional base in DNA (24Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which was preserved inDrosophila S3 but modified to asparagine in human S3. This difference therefore gave us a unique opportunity to test the importance of a single amino acid for the glycolytic removal of a modified base, using as a comparison an enzyme that is highly homologous but nevertheless incapable of efficiently carrying out this step in base excision repair. What can clearly be suggested from our studies is that a glutamine residue in Drosophila S3, which presumably rests at the mouth of the active site pocket, as predicted from the structure of other DNA repair proteins, is involved in the removal of 8-oxoG. Although others have identified a lysine residue as participating in this important function (8Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Karvate J. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 9Nash H.M. Lu R. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), those studies lacked the ability to compare highly homologous proteins in different organisms in which one lacked the N-glycosylase step. Indeed, drawing conclusions from a single amino acid change can lead to erroneous interpretations without a model system such as the one we have been able to exploit. The helix-hairpin-helix-GPD motif has been concluded to be a trademark of a “superfamily” of DNA glycosylases (8Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Karvate J. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies suggest that the interaction of the helix-hairpin-helix-GPD domain with DNA is mediated by amino acids located in the strongly conserved loop (LPGV) and at the N-terminal end of the second helix. Although the sequence of the equivalent Drosophila loop differs quite considerably (IMES), the protein is clearly able to remove 8-oxoG residues in DNA, as well as to liberate 5′-and 3′-modified termini at abasic sites in DNA (35Sandigursky M. Yacoub A. Kelley M.R. Deutsch W.A. Franklin W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17480-17484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, when the N-glycosylase activity ofDrosophila S3 was abrogated with a Gln to Ala change, a corresponding loss in the δ-elimination reaction was observed, thus creating an enzyme that behaves identical to that seen for the human S3 protein. This implies that the same amino acid may be involved both in the liberation of a nonconventional base in DNA and in the δ-cleavage of the phosphodiester bond 5′ and adjacent to an abasic site. Our in vitro results were supported by experiments executedin vivo that showed that a change in Gln converted theDrosophila S3 protein product into one that poorly protected RPC501 from the toxic effects of MMS and H2O2. The amino acid changes to Ala and Asn more closely resembled the protective ability conveyed by human S3, which at the very least was no better than RPC501 on its own. Experiments comparingDrosophila S3 and human S3 in rescuing the MMC sensitivity of Fanconi's anemia offer another example in which the expression ofDrosophila S3 far exceeds that of human S3 (38Kelley M.R. Tritt R. Xu Y. New S. Freie B. Clapp D.W. Deutsch W.A. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The power of S3 to efficiently protect cells from a variety of different DNA lesions in vivo may lie in its ability to hydrolytically liberate a 3′-abasic site and thereby result in a one-nucleotide gap in DNA that would be susceptible to filling by β-DNA polymerase. We and others have concluded that mechanistically the δ-elimination reaction may involve a second encounter with the remaining abasic site after a concerted N-glycosylase/AP lyase activity generates an AP site with a phosphodiester break 3′ to the abasic site (11Dodson M.L. Michaels M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our studies tend to point to the involvement of a Gln residue for both the N-glycosylase and δ-elimination activities possessed by Drosophila S3. However, our results do not rule out the participation of other active site amino acids previously shown to be critical for the base excision repair of 8-oxoG. Clearly, additional studies are warranted to determine the identity of those amino acids within the active site pocket that might also be involved in theN-glycosylase/AP lyase steps of base excision repair and, upon completion of those studies, to determine whether the second encounter hypothesis is indeed valid."

Here we report that many vertebrates contain an additional type of HMGN protein named HMGN3 (Trip 7). The humanHMGN3 gene is located on chromosome 6 and spans 32 kilobase pairs, which is nearly 10-fold longer than the closely relatedHMGN2 gene. However, the intron/exon boundaries of theHMGN3 gene are identical to those of HMGN1 andHMGN2. Unique within the HMGN family, the HMGN3 transcript undergoes alternative splicing and generates two different variants, HMGN3a and HMGN3b. The shorter variant, HMGN3b, arises from an additional splice site that truncates exon V and causes a frameshift. The resulting HMGN3b protein lacks the majority of the C-terminal chromatin-unfolding domain. Both splice variants are found in many vertebrates from frogs to man and are expressed in many tissues. The pattern of tissue-specific expression differs considerably from those of HMGN1 and HMGN2 at both the mRNA and the protein level.

In addition, all mammalian and most vertebrate cells contain the non-histone chromosomal HMGN proteins (HMG-14/-17), 1The revised nomenclature for HMG proteins is as follows: HMGN1 was HMG-14.

Consistent with a role in unfolding chromatin for transcription, HMGN family members are preferentially associated with actively transcribed regions of DNA in vivo (11Hock R. Wilde F. Scheer U. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6992-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HMGN proteins are the only known proteins that specifically recognize the generic structure of the 147-base pair nucleosome core particle, the building block of the chromatin fiber (12Mardian J.K. Paton A.E. Bunick G.J. Olins D.E. Science. 1980; 209: 1534-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Sandeen G. Wood W.I. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3757-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). They contain the following three highly conserved functional domains: the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS),2 the nucleosome-binding domain (NBD), and the chromatin-unfolding domain. The two founding members of the HMGN family, HMGN1 (HMG-14)1 and HMGN2 (HMG-17),1 bind to isolated nucleosome core particles in a cooperative manner, forming complexes of one core particle with either two molecules of HMGN1 or two molecules of HMGN2 (14Postnikov Y.V. Trieschmann L. Rickers A. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In vivo, HMGN2 has been shown to bind to clusters of approximately six contiguous nucleosomes that do not contain any HMGN1 (15Postnikov Y.V. Herrera J.E. Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cross-linking, footprinting, and chromatin reconstitution experiments suggest that the proteins unfold chromatin by targeting histone H1 (4Ding H.F. Bustin M. Hansen U. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies have revealed that HMGN1 and HMGN2 are localized in many foci throughout the nucleus and that these foci co-localize with sites of active transcription (11Hock R. Wilde F. Scheer U. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6992-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Postnikov Y.V. Herrera J.E. Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The two proteins appear to be segregated into distinct domains, however, as each focus only contains either HMGN1 or HMGN2 (15Postnikov Y.V. Herrera J.E. Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Photobleaching experiments have shown that HMGN1 and HMGN2 are highly mobile in the nucleus, in contrast to the almost immobile histone H2B (22Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 23Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intranuclear organization of HMGN1 and HMGN2 is dependent on transcriptional activity, as the addition of transcriptional inhibitors causes HMGN2 to be relocated to interchromatin granules, and mitotic chromosomes are void, or highly depleted, of both HMGN1 and HMGN2 (11Hock R. Wilde F. Scheer U. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6992-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications are also likely to alter the localization of HMGN proteins, as phosphorylation and acetylation inhibit the interaction of HMGN1/HMGN2 with chromatin (25Spaulding S.W.

Thus, the intranuclear organization of the HMGN proteins is highly dynamic, and the proteins participate in the regulation of transcription and other DNA-dependent activities by unfolding chromatin. The hallmark of HMGN proteins is the nucleosome-binding domain, which was originally found only in the canonical HMGN1 and HMGN2 proteins. Recently, we discovered a new member of the HMGN family, NBP-45 (also named NSBP1), that also binds specifically to nucleosome core particles (31Shirakawa H. Landsman D. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6368-6374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). NBP-45 is unique in that in addition to the nucleosome-binding domain and the chromatin-unfolding domain, it has a large (321 amino acids), negatively charged C-terminal domain that can activate transcription in a reporter assay. In addition, a cDNA coding for a closely related protein named Trip 7 (renamed HMGN3),1 was detected in a HeLa cell library by a yeast two-hybrid assay using the ligand binding/dimerization/transactivation domain of rat thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1) as bait (32Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the two-hybrid assay, HMGN3 interacted with both the thyroid hormone receptor and with retinoid X receptor in a ligand-dependent manner. In view of the similarity between HMGN3 and the other known members of the HMGN family, and considering that these proteins bind to nucleosomes, it is possible that HMGN3 promotes the interaction of hormone receptors with the chromatin template. However, to date, neither the protein nor the gene coding for HMGN3 has been characterized. In GenBankTM, the annotation of the partial HMGN3 cDNA clone indicates the presence of additional residues N-terminal to the PKRK motif that is the consensus start sequence of all HMGN proteins, raising the possibility that in fact HMGN3 is a novel type of HMGN protein. Here we report the first characterization of the HMGN3 gene, transcript, and protein. We demonstrate that the protein is encoded by an unusually large gene located on human chromosome 6 and is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Unlike other members of the HMGN family, HMGN3 exists as two splice variants, named HMGN3a and HMGN3b, and the latter lacks most of the C-terminal chromatin-unfolding domain. The presence of additional members of the HMGN family within eukaryotic cells raises the possibility that these proteins have specific roles in tissue-specific gene regulation. HMGN3 ESTs were found by searching GenBankTM with the L40351 sequence using the basic BLAST 2.1 tool on the NCBI website. Sequences were manipulated and aligned using Biowire Jellyfish version 1.21 or Multialin (33Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4275) Google Scholar). The polyadenylation signal in the humanHMGN3 gene was identified using the Baylor College of Medicine HGSC web tool. CpG islands were identified using the European Bioinformatics Institute CpG island web tool. The genomic sequence of human HMGN3 was found by a BLAST search of the working draft of the human genome on the NCBI website using the consensus mRNA sequence for HMGN3a. The promoters of the HMGN1, HMGN2, andHMGN3 genes were scanned for potential transcription factor-binding sites using the TFSEARCH program, which utilizes the TRANSFAC data base (34Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The following ESTs were used to deduce the mRNA sequences of the HMGN3 family: for Homo sapiens HMGN3a, L40357, W52083, andN36318; for H. sapiens HMGN3b, N35766, W7070, BE791451,BE876835, BF033675, and AV759176; for Mus musculus HMGN3a,AW823915 and BF662554; for M. musculus HMGN3b, W59311,AA929763, AA981952, AW209932, W64196, AA222444, BF714654, BF135613, andAA537482; and for M. musculus HMGN3a or HMGN3b, AW214601,BE949981, AW519800, AI848175, AA675136, BE980222, and AI449254. The consensus mRNA sequences for mouse and human HMGN3a and HMGN3b have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base. The Rattus sp. HMGN3 sequence was only found as two separate ESTs, H31484, which contains the first 156 nucleotides of the open reading frame, and AA851306, which has the remaining 152 nucleotides of the open reading frame and 412 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR. The EST forBos taurus HMGN3a is AV597694, which is consistent with the sequences of ESTs BE488022 and AW437389. The accession numbers for Xenopus laevis HMGN3a and HMGN3b are AW765830 andBE506630, respectively. Their sequences are consistent with the consensus sequence from ESTs AW200492, AW764421, AW764338, AW764769, and AW767112. The 5′-UTR of human HMGN3 was cloned from a human heart CapSite cDNATM library according to the manufacturer's instructions (Eurogentec). The first PCR utilized an HMGN3-specific primer (CTGCTTTTCCTCCTTCTTCCC, primer 1, Fig. 1) and a primer specific to the 38-mer recapping oligonucleotide that was used to generate the library. A second (nested) PCR was performed using the first PCR as a template, a second HMGN3-specific primer (TGGTTTGGGTTCAGGTTTTGG, primer 2, Fig. 1), and a second primer specific to the 38-mer recapping oligonucleotide. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that one PCR product had been generated, and this was ligated into the vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The CapSite cDNATM HMGN3 clone was identified by DNA sequencing. For the production of recombinant HMGN3a, the open reading frame of human HMGN3a was amplified from I.M.A.G.E. clone 268,208 (accession number N36318, obtained from ATCC) by PCR. The 5′- and 3′-primers contained NdeI and SalI sites, respectively. HMGN3b was amplified from I.M.A.G.E. clone 268,208 using the same 5′-primer and a 3′-primer that contained a SalI site and also introduced the codons for Glu, Asn, stop after codon 74, 5′-TCACCGTCGACTCAGTTTTCAGTACCTTCCTTTCCAGC-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into the NdeI and SalI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET30a. The sequences of the insert and the I.M.A.G.E. clone were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To create the expression vector for His6-HMGN3a, the HMGN3a open reading frame was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides containing restriction sites for either NcoI or SalI. The PCR product was cloned into the NcoI and SalI sites of pET30a, so that HMGN3a was inserted C-terminal to, and in frame with, the His6 and S-tags. The expression vector for His6-HMGN1 was a generous gift from Professor Ulla Hansen. For overexpression of recombinant proteins, expression vectors were transformed into BL21-DE3lysS cells, and expression was induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Recombinant HMGN proteins and 5% PCA tissue culture extracts were prepared as described previously (35Postnikov Y.V. Lehn D.A. Robinson R.C. Friedman F.K. Shiloach J. Bustin M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4520-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mouse tissues were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline, and then PCA extracts were prepared as described previously (36Pash J. Popescu N. Matocha M. Rapoport S. Bustin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3836-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Overexpressed His6-tagged protein was purified using TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies were produced by Quality Biologicals, Inc. Two antibodies were raised in rabbit against keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates of the following peptides from hHMGN3: antibody 2751, RKSPENTEGKDGSKVTKQEPT; antibody 2752, KTSAKKEPGAKISRGA. Antibody 2859 was raised in chicken against the following peptide: APSENGETKAEEAQKTESVDNEGE. The antibodies were affinity purified using the same peptide sequences. Protein samples were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% milk, membranes were washed in PBST and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibody in PBST and 1% milk. The final antibody concentrations used were as follows: 2751 and 2752, 6 ng/ml; 2859, 50 ng/ml; αHMGN2, 1 ng/ml (37Bustin M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 214-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed three times in PBST and then incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-chicken IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) in PBST containing 5% milk. Membranes were washed and then the bound antibodies were detected with ECL plus detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cell 5% PCA extracts were further purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (35Postnikov Y.V. Lehn D.A. Robinson R.C. Friedman F.K. Shiloach J. Bustin M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4520-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the high mobility band that was believed to correspond to HMGN3b were identified by Western analysis of 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The band in question was cut from the gel and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (Protein/DNA Technology Center, Rockefeller University). Nucleosome core particles were purified from chicken red blood cell nuclei as described previously (18Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 38Kornberg R.D. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recombinant HMGN protein (20–200 nm) was incubated with 50 nm core particles in 5 µl of 2× TBE with 2% Ficoll for 15 min on ice. Samples were then loaded directly onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel made in 2× TBE and electrophoresed at 4 °C. A parallel lane containing bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes was run to measure the migration distance. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with SYBR gold stain (Molecular Probes) and photographed using a yellow photographic filter. His6-tagged HMGN1 and HMGN3a (20 µg) were incubated with 80 µl of a 25% slurry of TALON resin in 2× TBE on a rotating wheel overnight at 4 °C. The slurry was washed 5 times with 2× TBE and resuspended in a total volume of 80 µl of 2× TBE. The efficiency of HMGN binding to the resin was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The HMGN resin (400 ng of protein) was incubated with 10 µg of nucleosome core particles in 100 µl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The total volume of resin slurry added was equalized to 5 µl in each reaction. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel and then the HMGN resin with bound core particles was pelleted and washed 3 times with binding buffer. To extract the DNA from the pelleted resin, 150 µl of stop buffer (0.2 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate, 0.4m LiOAc) was added, and then the mixture was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol prior to ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen. As a control, DNA was also extracted from the unselected nucleosome pool. The DNA sequences were analyzed by a modified version of the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method, which is a PCR-based technique (39Shirakawa H. Herrera J.E. Bustin M. Postnikov Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37937-37944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each RAPD reaction contained one set of three 10-base oligonucleotide primers (obtained from Operon technologies, Inc.), which generated an average of 60 PCR products. In a previous study of whether HMGN1 and HMGN2 display sequence preference when binding to nucleosomes, 30 sets of 3 primers each were used to screen the nucleosomal DNA (39Shirakawa H. Herrera J.E. Bustin M. Postnikov Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37937-37944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, three of the primer sets were used. Set 1 contained primers W11, AE18, and BE11 (Operon Technologies, Inc.). Set 2 contained K06, AM03, and AD13. Set 3 contained primers AD08, AR11, and F08. PCRs were performed with amplitaq DNA polymerase under the manufacturer's recommended conditions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and contained one set of end-labeled primers and 50 ng of extracted nucleosomal DNA. A control reaction without template DNA was also performed. The PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 45 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Samples were electrophoresed on a sequencing gel, which was then dried and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Human and mouse RNA master dot blots and Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with32P-labeled open reading frame of human HMGN3 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The human RNA master blot was also probed with nucleotides 632–1015 from the 3′-UTR of the HMGN2 cDNA. The autoradiograms were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer and analyzed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The samples on the dot blots have been normalized to eight different housekeeping genes to allow the accurate determination of relative mRNA expression levels, whereas the samples on the Northern blots are normalized to β-actin (CLONTECH). The RNA samples on the human RNA master dot blot in Fig. 7 are as follows: A1, whole brain; A2, amygdala;A3, caudate nucleus; A4, cerebellum;A5, cerebral cortex; A6, frontal lobe;A7, hippocampus; A8, medulla oblongata;B1, occipital lobe; B2, putamen; B3,substantia nigra; B4, temporal lobe; B5,thalamus; B6, subthalamic nucleus; B7, spinal cord; C1, heart; C2, aorta; C3,skeletal muscle; C4, colon; C5, bladder;C6, uterus; C7, prostate; C8, stomach;D1, testis; D2, ovary; D3, pancreas;D4, pituitary gland; D5, adrenal gland;D6, thyroid gland; D7, salivary gland;D8, mammary gland; E1, kidney; E2, liver; E3, small intestine; E4, spleen;E5, thymus; E6, peripheral leukocyte;E7, lymph node; E8, bone marrow; F1, appendix; F2, lung; F3, trachea; F4,placenta; G1, fetal brain; G2, fetal heart;G3, fetal kidney; G4, fetal liver; G5, fetal spleen; G6, fetal thymus; G7, fetal lung;H1, yeast total RNA; H2, yeast tRNA;H3, Escherichia coli rRNA; H4,E. coli DNA; H5, poly(rA); H6, human Cot 1 DNA; H7, human DNA 100 ng; andH8, human DNA 500 ng.

HMGN3 was detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay through its ligand-dependent interaction with the thyroid hormone receptor, TRβ1 (32Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The annotated sequence of the partial HMGN3 cDNA clone in the GenBankTM data base (accession numberL40357) indicates the presence of several amino acids upstream to the PKRK motif that is the consensus N terminus of all HMGN proteins. Thus, it is possible that translation of the HMGN3 mRNA initiates upstream of this partial cDNA, generating a novel type of HMGN protein with additional N-terminal residues. A BLAST search with theL40357 sequence yielded over 60 EST clones for human HMGN3, indicating that this gene is widely expressed. Whereas there is some sequence variability in the 5′ regions of these clones, probably as a result of sequence or cloning errors, the EST with the longest sequence upstream of the putative open reading frame is clone BE791451. This clone does not contain any additional translation initiation codons, suggesting that the start of the protein is at the PKRK motif. To confirm that this is the full transcript, the 5′-UTR was also cloned by PCR from a CapSite cDNATM library (Fig.1 A). The generation of the CapSite cDNATM library utilizes the 5′ m7GpppN cap structure on eukaryotic mRNAs, so each cDNA clone should include its complete 5′ end. Two nested PCRs, each using a library-specific primer and a primer specific for HMGN3, were performed to clone the 5′-UTR of the mRNA. A single product was generated, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence of the CapSite cDNATM HMGN3 clone is the same as that of cloneBE791451, except that it has 5 nucleotides missing from the 5′ end (Fig. 1 A). We conclude that translation of HMGN3 initiates at the ATG codon at the start of the PKRK motif. The complete sequence of the human HMGN3 mRNA, which has been deposited in GenBankTM, was deduced by comparing the sequences of several EST clones and the CapSite cDNATMclone (Fig. 1 A). The mRNA is 854 nt long, encodes a protein of 98 residues, and has a strong polyadenylation signal 24 nucleotides from the end (Fig. 1 A). The human EST data base also contains many ESTs that are predicted to encode a truncated form of HMGN3. These ESTs have a 41-nucleotide deletion that occurs after the codon for glycine 72 (Fig. 1, A and B). The deletion causes a frameshift such that the succeeding codons encode Thr-Glu-Asn-STOP, and thus the translation product is 77 residues long. It is notable that the consensus mRNA sequences for the full-length and truncated proteins are identical except for the 41-nt deletion, indicating that they are both from the same gene and result from alternative splicing of the same primary transcript. Indeed, the message contains the consensus splicing signals GT and AG at either end of the deletion (indicated in bold and underlinedin Fig. 1 B). The predicted full-length and truncated proteins are termed HMGN3a and HMGN3b, respectively, to indicate that they are different splice forms. The structures of the HMGN3 mRNAs are similar to those of HMGN1 (40Landsman D. Srikantha T. Westermann R. Bustin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16082-16086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HMGN2 (41Landsman D. Soares N. Gonzalez F.J. Bustin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7479-7484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as each has a short 5′-UTR of 107–150 nt, an open reading frame of 237–276 nt, and a longer 3′-UTR of 440–900 nt (Fig.2 A). The open reading frame of HMGN3 shares 56–65% identity with those of HMGN1 and HMGN2. The 5′-UTR is less conserved, sharing 43–48% identity with those of HMGN1 and N2, and the 3′-UTRs are only 35–39% identical. The HMGN3 gene was identified by a BLAST search of the human genome data base using the consensus HMGN3 mRNA sequence. The gene is located on chromosome 6 in band 6q27 at 83.8 megabases, and the genomic sequence confirms the mRNA sequence shown in Fig. 1 A. The HMGN3gene has six exons, as do the HMGN1 and HMGN2genes (Fig. 2 B) (42Landsman D. McBride O.W. Soares N. Crippa M.P. Srikantha T. Bustin M. J. Biol.

Large enzyme quantities were purified for pre-steady-state kinetic analysis, which had not been done before with any eukaryotic nitrate reductase. Basic biochemical properties of recombinant nitrate reductase were similar to natural enzyme forms. Molybdenum content was lower than expected, which was compensated for by activity calculation on molybdenum basis. Stopped-flow rapid-scan spectrophotometry showed that the enzyme FAD and heme were rapidly reduced by NADH with and without nitrate present. NADPH reduced FAD at less than one-tenth of NADH rate. Reaction of NADH-reduced enzyme with nitrate yielded rapid initial oxidation of heme with slower oxidation of flavin. Rapid-reaction freeze-quench EPR spectra revealed molybdenum was maintained in a partially reduced state during turnover. Rapid-reaction chemical quench for quantifying nitrite production showed that the rate of nitrate reduction was initially greater than the steady-state rate, but rapidly decreased to near steady-state turnover rate. However, rates of internal electron transfer and nitrate reduction were similar in magnitude with no one step in the catalytic process appearing to be much slower than the others. This leads to the conclusion that the catalytic rate is determined by a combination of rates with no overall rate-limiting individual process.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 2Solomonson L.P. Barber M.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 225-253Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar). NR contains an internal electron transfer system consisting of an FAD, heme-iron, and molybdenum-molybdopterin (Mo-MPT). The internal redox cofactors, which have a stoichiometry of 1:1:1 for FAD:heme:Mo-MPT, are bound to independently folding domains of the ∼100-kDa polypeptide, which forms homodimers and -tetramers in the active enzyme (3Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NR has two active sites: one for NAD(P)H to donate electrons to the FAD, which is connected via a cyt b domain to the Mo-MPT domain that possesses the nitrate reducing activity. The structure of the recombinant cyt b reductase fragment of corn NADH:NR, representing the C-terminal 270 residues containing the FAD and NADH binding sites, has been determined (4Lu G. Campbell W.H. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1994; 2: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Lu G. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Dwivedi U.N. Campbell W.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 931-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The structure of the cytb reductase fragment demonstrates that this portion of the enzyme is related to the ferredoxin NADP+ reductase family of enzymes (6Correll C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C. Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2112-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of NR, containing the Mo-MPT binding site and nitrate-reducing active site, is related by sequence similarity to sulfite oxidase, another Mo-MPT-containing enzyme, for which a structure was recently determined (7Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The bridge between these parts of NR is the cyt b domain, which is related by sequence similarity to mammalian cyt b 5 and to sulfite oxidase's cyt b domain (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 7Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, a model for holo-NR has been generated by combining atom replacement models of the N-terminal Mo-MPT and cyt b domains with the cytb reductase structure (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 5Lu G. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Dwivedi U.N. Campbell W.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 931-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The holo-NR model is dimeric with the dimer interface domain modeled after sulfite oxidase (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 7Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, in the sulfite oxidase structure, the heme in the cytb domain is 32 Å from the Mo-MPT center in the sulfite-oxidizing domain. It has been suggested these prosthetic groups in sulfite oxidase must move closer during catalysis for efficient electron transfer (8Pacheco A. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Enemark J.H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), since the rate of electron transfer is close to 1,000 s−1 between the centers in sulfite oxidase and the rate predicted by current models is <100 s−1 for a 32-Å separation (9Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 537-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). However, it is conceivable that electron transfer between centers in different subunits is more efficient than the intrasubunit process. Evidence for a shift of the coordinating ligands to molybdenum in NR, when going from resting to turnover forms, was recently obtained by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (10George G.N. Mertens J.A. Campbell W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9730-9731Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed, domain-domain movement to an enzyme conformation required for efficient electron transfer may be part of the catalytic mechanism of NR. Although structural aspects of NR biochemistry remain unresolved, steady-state kinetic studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of enzyme catalysis (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 2Solomonson L.P. Barber M.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 225-253Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The two-site ping-pong steady-state kinetic mechanism best describes the interactions of the substrates, NAD(P)H and nitrate, with the enzyme's two active sites (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of the pyridine nucleotide electron donation active site is about 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of the nitrate-reducing active site. In contrast to many other redox enzymes, NR activity is not limited by its rate of reduction and it has a high k cat of ∼200 s−1 (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The high rate of reduction of the enzyme's FAD by NADH has been demonstrated in kinetic studies of the recombinant cyt b and cyt c reductase fragments of NR, which had FAD reduction rates of 474 and 560 s−1 at 10 °C, respectively (11Ratnam K. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24067-24072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Ratnam K. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2122-2128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggested that NR catalysis is limited either by internal electron transfer to molybdenum, or the rate of nitrate reduction at the molybdenum center, or the rate of release of nitrite. Furthermore, based on the reduced dye (methyl viologen and bromphenol blue) nitrate-reducing activity of NR, which exceeds NADH:NR activity, it has been suggested that internal electron transfer from heme to molybdenum is rate-limiting in NR (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 2Solomonson L.P. Barber M.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Barber M.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11445-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We report here the first determination of rates of internal electron transfer within holo-NR, the reduction status of redox centers during steady-state turnover, and the catalytic rate for nitrate reduction by fully reduced enzyme. These experiments were made possible by recombinant expression of Arabidopsis NIA2 (AtNR2) inPichia pastoris (15Su W.-P. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using a fermenter to produce the enzyme permitted us to purify the large quantities of NR needed for pre-steady-state kinetic analysis involving all three redox centers, including stopped-flow, rapid-scan spectrophotometry of the FAD and heme centers, and rapid-reaction, freeze-quench EPR of the molybdenum center, FAD semiquinone and heme-iron. Rapid reaction of NADH-reduced NR with nitrate, which was quenched by zinc acetate and followed by quantification of the nitrite formed, resulted in a direct evaluation of the rate of formation of nitrite. We find that molybdenum does not remain fully reduced in steady-state turnover, when approached from the fully reduced state, indicating that internal electron transfer to molybdenum is at least a partially rate-limiting step under these conditions. However, when fully reduced enzyme reacts with nitrate, and nitrite production determined over the first 100 ms, the initial rate of nitrite formation is faster than the steady-state rate. This suggests that there is a rough equality between the electron transfer and nitrate reduction rates with neither process independently limiting the catalytic activity. Recombinant AtNR2 was expressed in P. pastoris as described previously (15Su W.-P. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that a Bio-Flo3000 fermenter (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc., Edison, NJ) was used to grow the cells to high density at 30 °C. The cells were lysed at 2–4 °C with a continuous-flow Dyno Mill model KDL (Glen Mills, Clifton, NJ) with 0.6-liter stainless steel grinding container filled with glass beads using a flow rate of 10 liters h−1 and two passes, as described previously (16Mertens J.A. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After centrifugation to remove cell debris, AtNR2 was purified by the method described previously (10George G.N. Mertens J.A. Campbell W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9730-9731Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar,15Su W.-P. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (3Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mertens J.A. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). NADH:NR activity was determined by the rate of nitrite formation (3Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also by monitoring the rate of oxidation of NADH in a spectrophotometer. The molar concentration of AtNR2 was determined at 413 nm using ε = 120 mm−1 cm−1(3Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molybdenum content of AtNR2 was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (University of Georgia, Chemical Analysis Laboratory, Athens, GA) on four different enzyme preparations with the results averaged after correction for background, using buffer as the background matrix. The MPT content of AtNR2 was determined as described previously (17Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Anaerobic redox titrations were done as previously described (16Mertens J.A. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), except for EPR analysis of molybdenum, which was done in an anaerobic glove box by poising AtNR2 at various potentials versus a calomel electrode using sodium dithionite and potassium ferricyanide, with a mixture of redox dyes to allow efficient equilibration (18Boll M. Fuchs G. Meier C. Trautwein A. Lowe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31857-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and freezing the samples in EPR tubes using liquid nitrogen. The midpoint redox potentials are expressed relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. For EPR, anaerobic electron titration was done in a glove box by titrating NR with aliquots of NADH calculated to add 0.5 electron eq/heme and the series of aliquots frozen in liquid nitrogen in EPR tubes. For UV-visible spectral analysis, anaerobic electron titration was done in a cuvette with a septum-containing screw cap (Starna Cells, Inc., Atascadero, CA), where anaerobic NR was titrated with anaerobic NADH, added in 0.5-electron eq steps with a gas-tight syringe. Before the first addition and after each addition and brief mixing, the solution was scanned using an HP8452A UV-visible diode array spectrophotometer at 22 °C. Stopped-flow rapid-scan spectrophotometry was done on a Hi-Tech KinetAsyst double mixing stopped-flow system (Hi-Tech Scientific, Wiltshire, United Kingdom) within an anaerobic glove box, using the KinetaScan detector, as described previously (16Mertens J.A. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mixing manifold and glove box environment were thermostatically controlled to provide temperatures from 5 °C to 25 °C. Data were analyzed using Hi-Tech KinetAsyst 2.0 and SPECFIT 3.0.12 (Spectrum Software Associates, Chapel Hill, NC) programs. Molar concentrations of NADH, NADPH, and nitrate were determined by spectrophotometry using appropriate extinction coefficients. The buffer in all experiments was 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. NADH, NADPH, and MOPS were from Sigma, and all other chemicals were of the purest grade available. In most experiments, the Hi-Tech KinetaScan diode array detector was used in the multiwavelength mode and spectra were recorded from 350 to 700 nm (Fig. 1), although rates at particular wavelengths were checked in the single wavelength mode to ensure photolysis was not occurring. The stopped flow apparatus of this system has a dead time of ∼1 ms and to observe the most rapid changes, 100 spectra were taken over the first 200 ms of the reactions. To observe changes in the oxidation state of FAD, theA 460 was analyzed, whereas for the heme-iron,A 557 was analyzed since the Sorét peaks atA 413 and A 424overlap. Rapid-freeze and rapid-quench reactions were carried out as described previously (19Bray R.C. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The sample syringes, mixing chamber, and aging tubing were held in a water bath at various temperatures as described under “Results and Discussion.” Differing reaction times are achieved by varying the length of the aging tubing without altering the flow rate of reactants. For freeze-quench rapid reactions, the contents of the aging tubing were expelled into a vessel containing isopentane at −140 °C, which is joined to an EPR tube. The frozen reaction mixture “snow” is tamped into the EPR tube with a rod having a Teflon® head with vents for the isopentane. EPR spectroscopy was carried out on an updated Bruker ER 200 SH spectrometer with samples maintained at 15 and 80 K using an ER 900 liquid helium boil-off system (Oxford Instruments). The EPR spectrometer was set up with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 0.2607 millitesla, microwave frequency of 9.4 ± 0.1 GHz, and microwave power of 5.02 milliwatts. EPR spectra were analyzed with the Bruker Win-EPR 2.11 program. For rapid reactions to measure nitrite formation, the reaction mixtures were expelled into microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.2 ml of 0.5m zinc acetate. After centrifugation and reaction with the nitrite determination reagents (3Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the absorbance at 540 nm was taken and quantity of nitrite determined using a standard curve prepared with nitrite standards. The progress of the reaction was fitted to the function [nitrite] = A(1 −e −kt) + Bt, with A and k varied to give a least squares fit to the data using the “Solver” function of Excel, and Bset to the steady-state activity of the enzyme of 20 s−1. Recombinant AtNR2 was produced in P. pastoris using fermenter cultures with a gene construct described previously (15Su W.-P. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Up to 20 mg of AtNR2 was produced per liter of culture in the fermenter. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity and gave specific activities ranging from 20 to 40 µmol of nitrite produced min−1mg−1 using AMP-Sepharose and blue Sepharose affinity chromatographies, and enzyme was eluted by NADH from both media (10George G.N. Mertens J.A. Campbell W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9730-9731Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Su W.-P. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Yields were ∼2 mg of NR/100 g of wet P. pastoris cells. In initial studies, electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme was used and in subsequent experiments, less pure enzyme prepared by just AMP-Sepharose was used to make larger quantities available. Analysis of AtNR2 gave a molybdenum content of 0.20 ± 0.02 mol/mol of heme, which agreed with a low molybdenum content found by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (10George G.N. Mertens J.A. Campbell W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9730-9731Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The MPT content was similar to the molybdenum content at 0.18 mol/mol of heme. Analysis by native gradient gel electrophoresis and gel filtration indicated recombinant AtNR2 was mostly tetrameric with a small amount of dimer (Ref. 16Mertens J.A. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; data not shown). These results indicate the majority AtNR2 enzyme molecule is a tetramer with one subunit containing FAD, heme-iron, and molybdenum and the other three subunits containing only FAD and heme-iron, although minority species containing different proportions are likely to be present statistically. Under anaerobic conditions, the visible spectra of oxidized and NADH-reduced AtNR2 were very similar to those reported previously for eukaryotic NR forms (Fig. 1). The extinction coefficients for the wavelengths of interest in this study were determined (Table I). The values were based on the previously reported extinction coefficient for the Sorét peak of oxidized squash NADH:NR at 413 nm (3Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the values for reduced AtNR2 agree well with those for reduced squash NR. The extinction coefficients for NADPH-reduced enzyme were virtually identical. The data indicate that the FAD and heme were spectrally identical in all the subunits of the holo-enzyme despite the absence of the Mo-MPT cofactor from some of its subunits. EPR spectra of oxidized and fully reduced AtNR2 were devoid of signals at 80 K, whereas the oxidized heme-iron of NR's internal cyt b, observed at 15 K by EPR, had a typical low spin ferric heme spectrum. When AtNR2 was reduced with 1 eq of NADH/enzyme heme under anaerobic conditions, a strong MoV signal was observed at 80 K and a diminished heme-iron signal at 15 K. These EPR spectra were similar to those reported previously for spinach and Chlorella NR (20Solomonson L.P. Barber M.J. Howard W.D. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 849-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Barber M.J. Notton B.A. Kay C.J. Solomonson L.P. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 70-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gutteridge S.

Anaerobic redox titrations of AtNR2 showed the FAD had a similar mid point potential at −270 mV to those found for NR and its FAD-containing fragments, whereas the heme was less negative at −50 mV than previously reported for holo-NR (1Campbell W.H.

Biophys. 1997; 345: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Anaerobic redox titration of the molybdenum observed by EPR at 80 K yielded the MoVI to MoV couple at 40 mV and the MoV to MoIV couple at −30 mV, which gives an average for the MoVI to MoIV couple at 5 mV. This value is similar to spinach and Chlorella NR at 25 °C, but significantly more positive than found forChlorella NR at 173 K (24Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Solomonson L.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6142-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5750-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Kay C.J.

Thus, it appears that the molybdenum center in AtNR2 is similar in redox properties to other NR forms.Table IMillimolar extinction coefficients of oxidized and NADH-reduced recombinant AtNR2WavelengthOxidizedNADH-reducedAbsolute differencenmmm−1cm−1mm−1cm−1mm−1 cm−14131201-aExtinction coefficient at 413 nm was assumed to be 120 mm−1 cm−1, based on squash cotyledon NADH:NR (3).

Using an NADH oxidation progress curve with the stline curve fitting method (27Abraham Z. Smith B.E. Howes B.D. Lowe D.J. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the K m for NADH was determined to be 0.7 ± 0.3 µm at 30 °C, which is slightly lower than previously reported values (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The nitrateK m was 90 ± 20 µm, which is similar to Chlorella NR but higher than some other NR forms (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

This compares well with the “intrinsic”k cat values for other NADH:NR forms with known molybdenum content (Table II; Refs. 3Redinbaugh M.G. Campbell W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3380-3385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and28Solomonson L.P. Lorimer G.H. Hall R.L. Borchers R. Bailey L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4120-4127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The k cat/K m values for NADH and nitrate are 300 and 2.3 µm−1s−1, respectively, which are similar to previously reported values (1Campbell W.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Overall, AtNR2 appears to be similar in steady-state kinetic properties to other NR forms despite its low Mo-MPT content, which suggests that the fully functional portion of the enzyme is not perturbed into an unusual state by the absence of molybdenum from some of its subunits or by being folded differently in the recombinant environment.Table IIIntrinsic steady-state catalytic rate for NADH:nitrate reductasesNR sourcek cat (per heme-iron)Molybdenum content (per heme-iron)k cat (per molybdenum)References−1mol fractions−1CvNR1380.817328Solomonson L.P.

To better understand the regulation of CETP synthesis and the relationship between CETP levels and cellular lipid metabolism, we selected the SW872 adipocytic cell line as a model. These cells secrete CETP in a time-dependent manner at levels exceeding those observed for Caco-2 or HepG2 cells. The addition of LDL, 25OH-cholesterol, oleic acid, or acetylated LDL to SW872 cells increased CETP secretion (activity and mass) up to 6-fold. In contrast, CETP production was decreased by almost 60% after treatment with lipoprotein-deficient serum or β-cyclodextrin. These effects, which were paralleled by changes in CETP mRNA, show that CETP biosynthesis in SW872 cells directly correlates with cellular lipid status. To investigate a possible, reciprocal relationship between CETP expression and cellular lipid homeostasis, CETP biosynthesis in SW872 cells was suppressed with CETP antisense oligonucleotides. Antisense oligonucleotides reduced CETP secretion (activity and mass) by 60% compared with sense-treated cells. When CETP synthesis was suppressed for 24 h, triglyceride synthesis was unchanged, but cholesterol biosynthesis was reduced by 20%, and acetate incorporation into CE increased 31%. After 3 days of suppressed CETP synthesis, acetate incorporation into the CE pool increased 3-fold over control. This mirrored a similar increase in CE mass. The efflux of free cholesterol to HDL was the same in sense and antisense-treated cells; however, HDL-induced CE hydrolysis in antisense-treated cells was diminished 2-fold even though neutral CE hydrolase activity was unchanged. Thus, CETP-compromised SW872 cells display a phenotype characterized by inefficient mobilization of CE stores leading to CE accumulation. These results strongly suggest that CETP expression levels contribute to normal cholesterol homeostasis in adipocytic cells. Overall, these studies demonstrate that lipid homeostasis and CETP expression are tightly coupled.

Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CETP mRNA is expressed in a number of tissues (6Drayna D. Jarnagin A.S. McLean J. Henzel W. Kohr W. Fielding C. Lawn R. Nature. 1987; 327: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In humans, liver, spleen, and adipose tissue are the most abundant sources of CETP mRNA (7Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Studies in nonhuman primates also demonstrate that adipose tissue expresses high levels of CETP mRNA (8Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Quinet E. Tall A. Ramakrishnan R. Rudel L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1559-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All human tissues expressing CETP contain both a full-length form, which gives rise to plasma CETP, and a shortened mRNA, in which the exon 9-derived sequence has been deleted (10Inazu A. Quinet E.M. Wang S. Brown M.L. Stevenson S. Barr M.L. Moulin P. Tall A.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2352-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The product of this truncated message is poorly secreted but retains all sequences known to be necessary for lipid transfer activity (11Yang T.P. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12603-12609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that CETP significantly modulates lipoprotein metabolism, including the multi-step process known as reverse cholesterol transport. Genetic alterations in CETP levels in humans and transgenic mice are associated with impairment of important steps involved in reverse cholesterol transport (12Bruce C. Chouinard Jr., R.A. Tall A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 297-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Additionally, elevated CETP levels increase the rate at which cholesteryl ester (CE) returns to the liver (13Jiang X.C.

Although some of these effects are mediated through the actions of circulating CETP, the widespread tissue distribution of CETP mRNA raises the possibility that CETP synthesized by various peripheral tissues may have local functions in lipid metabolism as well. Such a dual role would help explain why some species that do not have circulating CETP have a CETP-like gene and express detectable CETP message in various tissues (4Jiang X.C. Moulin P. Quinet E.

Indeed, it has been shown that CETP enhances sperm capacitation (15Ravnik S.E. Zarutskie P.W. Muller C.H. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 47: 1126-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and facilitates the efflux of CE from cells (16Morton R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, CETP associates with cell plasma membranes where it appears to facilitate CE selective uptake (17Benoist F.

Although the regulation of CETP activity in plasma and its responsiveness to dietary cholesterol have been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating CETP expression have been difficult to dissect. This is at least partly due to the lack of reproducible cell models where these regulatory events can be studied most easily. Although several cell lines have been reported to synthesize and secrete CETP (18Swenson T.L. Simmons J.S. Hesler C.B. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1162-1166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether these cultured cells regulate CETP biosynthesis in a physiologically relevant manner and how this regulation is integrated with cellular lipid homeostasis. Given the reported secretion of CETP by the SW872 adipocytic cell line (21Richardson M.A. Berg D.T. Johnston P.A. McClure D. Grinnell B.W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1162-1166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the physiological importance of adipose tissue in CETP biosynthesis (22Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have investigated the regulation of CETP expression in this human liposarcoma. We report here that CETP synthesis in SW872 cells is closely correlated with cellular lipid status and that CETP synthesis responds to lipid stimuli in a manner analogous to that seen in vivo. We also show for the first time that cellular lipid homeostasis in the SW872 cell line is dependent on the normal expression of CETP. The human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 (American Type Culture Collection HTB-37), the human liposarcoma cell line SW872 (American Type Culture Collection HTB-92), and the hepatocarcinoma HepG2 (American Type Culture Collection HB-8065) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (DMEM/F-12) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal bovine serum was from Bio Whitaker.

Guinea pig anti-perilipin antibody and donkey anti-guinea IgG peroxidase conjugate were from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flander, NJ). Immobilized protein A was from Pierce. The human CETP cDNA (CETP.11, American Type Culture Collection 59792) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. All cells (HepG2, SW872, and Caco-2) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (3:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. For experiments, Caco-2 cells were cultured on transwell filters (Corning Costar Corporation, Cambridge, MA). When cells achieved 100% confluence, the spent medium was aspirated, and fresh DMEM/F-12 was added. Conditioned medium, collected at the indicated times, was centrifuged briefly to remove cell debris and then assayed for CE transfer activity to determine basal secretion rates. For Caco-2 cells, transfer activity was measured in the lower (basolateral) compartment (20Faust R.A. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8786-8789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effects of various lipid donors on CETP synthesis and secretion, cells were pretreated overnight with DMEM/F-12 containing 5% LPDS. Subsequently, cells were washed thoroughly with serum-free medium and then incubated for 24 h with DMEM/F-12 containing native LDL (100 µg/ml), oleate/bovine serum albumin (500 µm), acetylated LDL (100 µg/ml), or 25-OH-cholesterol (100 µm).

Stoudt G.W. Rodriguerza W.V. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), or both LPDS and β-cyclodextrin for 24 h. After either protocol, the treatment medium was removed, and the cells were washed and then incubated in DMEM/F-12 alone for 48 h. CETP activity and mass was measured in conditioned medium as described below. The cell protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of TG content on CETP secretion, SW872 cells were pretreated with DMEM/F-12 containing 5% LPDS overnight and then incubated with DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 200 µm sodium oleate/bovine serum albumin (1–4 days). At the indicated times, this medium was replaced by DMEM/F-12 alone and incubated for an additional 48 h. Conditioned medium was assayed for CE transfer activity, and the TG mass content of cells was measured enzymatically (28Mendez A.J. Cabeza C. Hsia S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cholesteryl ester transfer assays were carried out as described (29Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled donor lipoprotein (3H-CE, 10 µg of cholesterol) and unlabeled acceptor lipoprotein (HDL, 10 µg of cholesterol) were incubated with conditioned medium (100–200 µl) at 37 °C for 18 h. The assay was terminated by selectively precipitating LDL (donor) by the addition of sodium phosphate and MnCl2. The percentage of radiolabeled CE transferred to HDL, expressed as %kt, was calculated as described previously (29Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some instances, samples were preincubated for 30 min with 10 µg of anti-CETP IgG (TP2) (30Yen F.T. Deckelbaum R.J. Mann C.J. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 2018-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) before initiating the transfer assay. CETP protein secreted into the medium was determined by Western blot analysis. Briefly, 5–6 ml of conditioned medium was concentrated to 1 ml using Centriprep-10 concentrators (Millipore Corp.) and incubated with immunoprecipitation buffer (200 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% sodium azide) containing a polyclonal antibody (1:1000) raised against human CETP (16Morton R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, 10 µl of immobilized protein A was added and incubated for 2 h, and the protein-agarose complex was pelleted by centrifugation and washed extensively. CETP was eluted from the agarose by adding 50 µl of 1 m glycine, pH 2.5, combined with gel-loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blot was accomplished using TP2 anti-CETP antibody (30Yen F.T. Deckelbaum R.J. Mann C.J. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 2018-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and anti-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The cells at 100% confluence were pretreated with medium containing 5% LPDS for 24 h and then treated with different lipids for an additional 24 h. Total RNA was then isolated using trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). CETP mRNA levels were analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay using the Ambion RPAIII kit (Ambion) and an antisense RNA probe. The antisense CETP riboprobe was prepared using T7 RNA polymerase and [32P]CTP from a pcDNA3-CETP construct that contained a fragment of human CETP cDNA spanning from 205 to 727 nucleotide of the coding sequence. An antisense riboprobe synthesized to the 3′ end of human actin was used to normalize RNA levels. CETP oligonucleotides A and B, corresponding to positions 291–311 and 359–379 of the human CETP mRNA coding sequence (6Drayna D. Jarnagin A.S. McLean J. Henzel W. Kohr W. Fielding C. Lawn R. Nature. 1987; 327: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), respectively, were synthesized as follows. Oligonucleotide A was 5′-GAGCCAGCTACCCAGATATCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGATATCTGGGTAGCTGGCTC-3′ (antisense). Oligonucleotide B was 5′-CACAACATCCAGATCAGCCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGGCTGATCTGGATGTTGTG-3′ (antisense). The synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, which were phosphorothioate modified and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified (Genosys), were dried and resuspended in Tris-EDTA (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and quantified by spectrophotometry. SW872 cells were transfected with oligonucleotides using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cells at 70% confluence were transfected with Opti-MEM medium containing LipofectAMINE alone or mixed with sense or antisense oligonucleotide for 5 h. The medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was then added, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. This medium was then removed and replaced by DMEM/F-12 alone, incubated for 48 h, and used for CE transfer assay. Different concentrations of oligonucleotide (100 nm to 1 µm) were tested. To assess the impact of reduced CETP secretion on free cholesterol, CE, and TG biosynthesis, SW872 cells were transfected as described above and then pretreated with DMEM/F-12 containing 5% LPDS overnight. The cells were then incubated with DMEM/F-12 containing additional sense or antisense oligonucleotide (500 nm) and [14C]acetate (0.5 µCi/well) for 6 h. This medium was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM/F-12 containing 1% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, cells were treated with oligonucleotide and [14C]acetate (0.5 µCi/well) for 3 days to achieve nearly isotopic equilibrium labeling of cellular CE pools in cells where CETP was suppressed long term. After either treatment protocol, the cells were washed extensively with PBS, trypsinized, solubilized in 1 ml of PBS, and sonicated. The lipids were extracted according to the method described by Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and fractionated on thin layer chromatography using a mixture of hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1). Radiolabeled CE, free cholesterol, and TG, identified by co-migration with authentic lipid standards, were scraped from the plate and quantitated. Cellular lipid efflux experiments in SW872 cells were performed by prelabeling control cells for 3 days in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and [3H]cholesterol (0.5 µCi/ml). The cells were washed three times with PBS and then transfected with Opti-MEM containing 500 nm sense or antisense oligonucleotide as described above. This medium was removed after 24 h, and fresh efflux medium containing 100 µg/ml of human HDL, and additional sense or antisense oligonucleotide was added for an additional 24 h. After removing this medium, cells were washed extensively with PBS, trypsinized, and sonicated. The lipids in cells and the efflux medium were extracted and separated as described above. The cholesterol synthesis rates were determined after preincubation of cells in LPDS for 24 h. Washed cells received 300 µm [14C]acetate (1340 cpm/nmol) in DMEM/F-12. After incubation, cellular lipids were extracted, and free cholesterol was isolated by thin layer chromatography as described above. The synthetic rates reported are the averages of three time points over the linear response range (≤6 h). Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity in whole cell lysates was determined from the hydrolysis of cholesteryl-(1-14C)oleate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) incorporated into phosphatidylcholine/taurocholate vesicles (32Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis was stopped by the addition of NaOH. Liberated, radiolabeled fatty acids were extracted and quantitated (33Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.-K. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8537-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis was linear for 50–300 µg of cell lysate protein (t = 1 h). To quantify CE mass, treated cells were washed extensively with PBS, and cellular lipids were extracted (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Cholesteryl heptadecanoate (as internal standard) was added to each sample prior to extraction. Lipids were fractionated by thin layer chromatography (see above). The CE band was scraped into a reaction tubes and transesterifed with BF3 as described by Sattler et al. (34Sattler W. Reicher H. Ramos P. Panzenboeck U. Hayn M. Esterbauer H. Malle E. Kostner G.M. Lipids. 1996; 31: 1303-1310Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resultant fatty acid methyl esters were extracted, dried under N2, and resuspended in 20-µl hexanes. One µl of this solution was separated and quantified by gas chromatography (35Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 833-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). CE mass was calculated from the mass of fatty acid determined by this method plus the corresponding mass of the sterol ring. CETP is expressed by a wide variety of tissues, including adipocytes (22Radeau T. Lau P. Robb M. McDonnell M. Ailhaud G. McPherson R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2552-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the interrelationships of CETP expression and lipid metabolism, we selected the SW872 liposarcoma as a representative of this tissue type. SW872 cells, previously reported to secrete CETP (21Richardson M.A. Berg D.T. Johnston P.A. McClure D. Grinnell B.W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1162-1166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are deficient in lipid storage droplets when grown in serum containing medium (Fig.1 A). The addition of oleate to the growth medium in the absence of agents required for cellular differentiation (i.e. hydrocortisone, insulin, etc.) (36Gauthier B. Robb M. McPherson R. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) results in the rapid accumulation of triglyceride-containing droplets. Most all cells contain numerous small, lipid-filled inclusions 24 h after oleate addition (Fig. 1 B); after 48 h, lipid storage droplets fill the bulk of the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C). Lipid accumulation is accompanied by a marked increase in cellular perilipin A (Fig. 1 D), which decorates the surface of lipid storage droplets in mature adipocytes (37Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). However, unlike lipid-laden adipocytes isolated from tissue, cholesterol biosynthesis in native SW872 cells is robust (2.5 nmol of acetate/mg protein/h incorporated into cholesterol following 24 h of LPDS preincubation) compared with that observed in LPDS-treated HepG2 hepatocytes (5.2 nmol/mg protein/h). Overall, these observations indicate that SW872 is a fully mature, lipid-poor adipocytic cell line. SW872 cells actively secrete CE transfer activity into the medium. Compared with the activity in two other cell lines of human origin that have been reported to secrete CETP, CE transfer activity secreted by SW872 cells exceeds that produced by confluent cultures of HepG2 or Caco-2 cells (157.5 ± 12.7, 31.5 ± 12.0, and 92.7 ± 8.7%kt/ml, respectively). The low CE transfer activity secreted by HepG2 cells is consistent with that previously reported, which may reflect the loss of essential regulatory factors during culture (38Agellon L.B. Zhang P. Cheng Jiang X. Mendelsohn L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22336-22339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CE transfer activity secreted by SW872 cells is reduced 79.2% by anti-CETP antibodies (Fig. 1 E). This level of inhibition is identical to the maximum suppression that could be achieved by this antibody with isolated plasma CETP (Fig. 1 E), demonstrating that essentially all CE transfer activity in conditioned medium is due to CETP. CETP secretion by confluent cultures of SW872 cells was nearly linear over 48 h of culture (Fig. 1 F). Subsequent studies were restricted to this linear response window. Dietary cholesterol has been shown to increase plasma CETP levels in different species (19Faust R.A. Albers J.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 267-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Son Y.S.C. Zilversmit D.B. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Martin L.J. Connelly P.W. Nancoo D. Wood N. Zhang Z.J. Maguire G. Quinet E. Tall A.R. Marcel Y.L. McPherson R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 437-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that dietary fatty acids can modulate CETP synthesis (41Quig D.W. Zilversmit D.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin.

Acta. 1995; 1258: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine whether CETP biosynthesis and secretion in SW872 cells is modulated by variations in cellular lipid levels, cells were incubated with different compounds known to increase or decrease cellular lipid content. Following a 24-h pretreatment with LPDS, cells were incubated with various sources of lipids for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated in medium alone (48 h) to collect medium for measurement of CETP secretion without interference of the test agents on the CETP assay. Compared with incubation in cells in medium alone, incubation of cells with oleate (500 µm) stimulated CETP secretion by 3.8-fold (Fig. 2 A). Incubation of SW872 cells with a source of cholesterol also increased CETP secretion. Native (100 µg/ml) and acetylated human LDL (100 µg/ml) induced a 2–6-fold increase in CETP activity secreted into conditioned medium. These increases in secreted CETP activity were accompanied by similar changes in CETP protein (Fig. 2 A, inset, shown for oleate and LDL only). The effect of lipoproteins could be mimicked in large part by incubation with 25-hydroxycholesterol (100 µm), strongly suggesting that the influence of lipoproteins on CETP secretion is mediated through their modification of sterol metabolism. The same qualitative response to these agents was observed with Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2 B). The effect of oleate on CETP secretion was concentration-dependent over a 50–500 µmrange (data not shown). To investigate the response of CETP secretion to TG accumulation, SW872 cells were continuously incubated with oleate (200 µm) up to 4 days prior to the collection of medium conditioned for 48 h for CETP determination. Although CETP secretion by control cells increased slightly during the experiment, CETP secretion within the 48 h collection window increased dramatically in oleate-treated cells (Fig. 2 C). Cells exposed to oleate for 4 days secreted 7-fold more CETP during the 48-h chase period than cells treated with the fatty acid for 2 days. The rate of CETP synthesis (%kt/h) correlated well with the amount of cellular TG, suggesting that CETP biosynthesis is progressively up-regulated in response to the accumulation of this lipid (Fig.2 C, inset). The above data demonstrate that CETP secretion is up-regulated under conditions of cholesterol delivery where cholesterol biosynthesis is diminished. To determine whether CETP secretion is responsive to reductions in cell lipid content, cell were grown in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum until they reached 100% confluence and then switch"

Topoisomerases can introduce DNA damage upon exposure to drugs that stabilize the covalent protein-DNA intermediate of the topoisomerase reaction. Lesions in DNA are also able to trap topoisomerase-DNA intermediates, suggesting that topoisomerases have the potential to either assist in DNA repair by locating sites of damage or exacerbating DNA damage by generation of additional damage at the site of a lesion. We have shown that overexpression of yeast topoisomerase I (TOP1) conferred hypersensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate and other DNA-damaging agents, whereas expression of a catalytically inactive enzyme did not. Overexpression of topoisomerase II did not change the sensitivity of cells to these DNA-damaging agents. Yeast cells lackingTOP1 were not more resistant to DNA damage than cells expressing wild type levels of the enzyme. Yeast topoisomerase I covalent complexes can be trapped efficiently on UV-damaged DNA. We suggest that TOP1 does not participate in the repair of DNA damage in yeast cells. However, the enzyme has the potential of exacerbating DNA damage by forming covalent DNA-protein complexes at sites of DNA damage.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). Topological changes catalyzed by these enzymes are required for a wide variety of cellular processes including transcription, replication, and chromosome segregation (2Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Postow L. Peter B.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The importance of topoisomerases in DNA metabolism has frequently led to the suggestion that topoisomerases might play important or essential roles in DNA repair and DNA damage tolerance. However, there has been little direct evidence that topoisomerases play a direct role in the repair of DNA damage in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Ref. 5Nitiss J.L. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 517-537Google Scholar). DNA topoisomerases are the targets of a large number of anti-cancer and anti-bacterial agents (6Rubin E.H. Li T.K. Duann P. Liu L.F. Cancer Treat. Res. 1996; 87: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). These agents stabilize a covalent intermediate where the enzyme is covalently bound to DNA through a phosphotyrosine linkage and, therefore, convert the enzyme into a DNA adduct with protein bound to the site of DNA strand breaks (8Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although the covalent intermediate is reversible, DNA metabolic processes such as replication can convert the intermediate into irreversible DNA damage. Extensive evidence has demonstrated that the DNA damage, rather than inhibition of enzyme activity, is responsible for cytotoxicity (9Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 10Nitiss J.L. Liu Y.X. Harbury P. Jannatipour M. Wasserman R. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4467-4472PubMed Google Scholar). Hence these agents have been termed topoisomerase poisons. Thus, topoisomerases clearly have the potential of inflicting cytotoxic DNA damage under appropriate circumstances. Recent experiments demonstrate that alterations in DNA structure are able to trap topoisomerases on DNA. Topoisomerase I can be trapped by strand discontinuities such as nicks or gaps (11Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26441-26447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or by mismatched bases (12Yeh Y.C. Liu H.F. Ellis C.A. Lu A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15498-15504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UV damage to DNA also efficiently traps eukaryotic Top1 on DNA (13Lanza A. Tornaletti S. Rodolfi C. Scanavini M. Pedrini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6978-6986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other types of DNA damage such as abasic sites and ethenoadenine adducts also stabilize Top1 covalent complexes (14Pourquier P. Ueng L.M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Pourquier P. Bjornsti M.A. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8516-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are two different mechanisms that can lead to topoisomerase I covalent complexes on DNA. UV damage, abasic sites, and mismatches all lead to a covalent complex that is not readily reversible. Other DNA lesions such as oxidized bases or benzo[a]pyrene adducts increase the rate of cleavage of the enzyme at or near the lesion but do not prevent re-ligation (17Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Pourquier P. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This latter mechanism has also been observed for topoisomerase II at abasic sites (18Kingma P.S. Corbett A.H. Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21441-21444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Other types of DNA damage such as UV damage inhibit topoisomerase II enzymatic activity but do not lead to increased topoisomerase II covalent complexes (20Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If DNA damage is able to trap topoisomerases on DNA in the same way as topoisomerase poisons, then topoisomerases may influence cell survival after DNA damage and may also influence the consequences of DNA lesions. Experiments described here test the hypothesis that the level of topoisomerases affect cell killing after DNA damage. We have taken advantage of the fact that yeast cells can tolerate different levels of both topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II. We have found that topoisomerase I overexpression greatly sensitizes yeast cells to DNA damage due to simple alkylating agents, UV light, or ionizing radiation, but overexpression of topoisomerase II does not affect yeast cell survival after exposure to these agents. These results indicate that topoisomerases can be important survival factors after DNA damage but that the enzymes do not participate directly in repair. The yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of CH335 (21Holm C. Goto T. Wang J.C. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 41: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). CH335leu was constructed by converting CH335 to leu2− by one-step gene disruption (22Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). A top1− derivative of the CH335leu was constructed by one-step gene disruption (23Nitiss J.L. Zhou J. Rose A. Hsiung Y. Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The top1− disruption removes the entire open reading frame of TOP1 and replaces it with the yeast LEU2 gene. The resulting strain is termed CH335top1−. Both strains CH335 and CH335leu were transfected with yCP50 or pGALyTOP1 (24Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The strains carrying yCP50 served as vector controls, whereas strains with pGALyTOP1, which expresses yeast TOP1 under the control of the yeastGAL1 promoter, were used for experiments where yeastTOP1 was overexpressed. Overexpression of humanTOP1 was accomplished using the vector pGALhTOP1 (25Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar), and expression of Escherichia coli topoisomerase I used the vector pGALECTOP1 (26Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The three vectors for overexpressing type I topoisomerases in yeast were the gift of Dr. J. C. Wang. A vector carrying the Y727F mutation under the control of the yeastGAL1 promoter was the gift of Dr. R. Sternglanz. Sensitivity of yeast cells to MMS1 was performed as described previously (10Nitiss J.L. Liu Y.X. Harbury P. Jannatipour M. Wasserman R. Wang J.C.

Cells were pre-grown in synthetic complete medium without uracil, with galactose as a carbon source (SC-ura/GAL). After overnight growth, cells were diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml in fresh SC-ura/GAL, and then appropriate concentrations MMS were added. Cells were incubated for various times at 30 °C with shaking, then aliquots were removed, and diluted samples were plated to synthetic complete agar lacking uracil, with glucose as carbon source (SC-ura/Glu). Survival is expressed relative to the number of viable colonies at the time of MMS addition. For the comparison of the sensitivity oftop1− and TOP1+ cells, the appropriate strains were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose/adenine (YPDA) medium as previously described (10Nitiss J.L. Liu Y.X. Harbury P. Jannatipour M. Wasserman R. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4467-4472PubMed Google Scholar), exposed to MMS for 3 h, then plated to YPDA agar to determine the surviving fraction. All determinations were performed with at least three independent isolates; the results shown are the means ± S.E. Sensitivity to ionizing radiation was determined by pre-growing cells in SC-ura/GAL as described above to a titer of about 107cells/ml. Cells were washed in water and resuspended in water at a concentration of about 107 cells/ml. Cells were exposed to ionizing radiation using a 137Cs irradiator at a flux of 0.77 krad/min. Dilutions were then plated to SC-ura/Glu, incubated for 3 days at 30 °C, and then counted to determine the surviving fraction. Sensitivity to UV light was determined by pre-growing cells in SC-ura/GAL as described above to a titer of about 107cells/ml. Cells were diluted and plated to SC-ura/Glu. The plates were immediately exposed to UV light using a Stratalinker (Stratagene) and subsequently protected from visible light to prevent photoreactivation. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C, then plates with an appropriate number of colonies were counted, and surviving fractions compared with unirradiated plates were determined. Yeast cells were exposed to MMS under the same conditions as described for survival determinations. Total yeast RNA was isolated using the acid phenol method (27Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 µg/sample) was separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde. The RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane by capillary transfer and UV cross-linked to the membrane. Hybridization was overnight at 60 °C in 0.25 mNaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS with a [32P]dCTP-labeled probe.32P-Labeled probes were prepared by random priming using a 2-kilobase BamHI fragment of the yeast RAD54gene. After hybridization, the membrane was washed 3 times at 65 °C for 15 min in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS and then exposed to Kodak Bio-Max film at −80 °C. Yeast topoisomerase I was purified using the procedure described by Bjornsti and co-workers (28Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pGALyTOP1 transformed into strain JEL1t1− (23Nitiss J.L. Zhou J. Rose A. Hsiung Y. Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One unit of topoisomerase I is defined as the amount of enzyme required to completely relax 400 ng of pUC18 in 30 min using relaxation assays as previously described (23Nitiss J.L. Zhou J. Rose A. Hsiung Y. Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase I preparation used in the experiments reported in this paper had a specific activity of 20 units/µg of protein. Formation of covalent complexes by yeast topoisomerase I was assessed using a modified K+/SDS assay. Negatively supercoiled pHOT1 DNA (TopoGen, Inc.) was used as a substrate for this assay. pHOT carries the strong topoisomerase I binding site identified by Westergaard and co-workers (29Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA was diluted toA 260 = 0.05 in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5. The DNA was UV-irradiated in a 100-mm2 tissue culture dish on ice using a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, 254 nm) to a final UV dose of 1000 J/m2. The DNA was then treated with an ATP-dependent exonuclease and purified using a large-construct kit protocol (Qiagen) to remove nicked DNA. The DNA was then digested with EcoRI and labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Chroma-spin (CLONTECH) columns. The specific activities of unirradiated and UV-irradiated DNA had similar specific activities, as determined by scintillation counting, ∼107 cpm/µg DNA. The cleavage reactions of 50 µl contained 250 ng of DNA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 15 µg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 8 units of yTOP1 protein. Where indicated, samples also contained 50 µg/ml camptothecin. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min then terminated using 1 ml of STOP buffer (1.25% SDS (w/v), 5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Then 0.25 ml of 325 mm KCl was added, and samples were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The samples were placed on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 8000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was completely removed, and samples were resuspended in 1 ml wash buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The samples were heated to 65 °C for 10 min then held on ice for 10 min and centrifuged as before. The wash procedure was carried out a total of three times. The final precipitate was resuspended in 0.4 ml of H20. 0.1 ml was removed and added to scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Negatively supercoiled pHOT1 DNA was linearized withEcoRI, diluted in water, and UV irradiated as described above. After UV treatment, the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. The topoisomerase I mobility shift assay conditions were as follows. Each reaction mixture (40 µl total volume) contained 250 ng ofEcoRI-linearized pHOT1 DNA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 15 µg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, the indicated units of yTOP1 protein, and as indicated, 20 µg/ml camptothecin. The salt concentration was then adjusted to 70 mm with KCl for each reaction. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions that were to be treated with proteinase K were stopped with 0.5 µl of 20% SDS; other sample reactions were stopped with 2 µl of 20% SDS. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 250 µg/ml in samples as indicated, and samples containing proteinase K were incubated overnight at 50 °C. All samples received 5 µl of a loading buffer without EDTA (60% sucrose and 0.67% Orange G) and were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel run for 400 V-h in Tris acetate EDTA (TAE) buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide, and the band corresponding to free DNA was excised (to minimize interference with the hybridization). The DNA contained in the upper portion of the gel was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was hybridized overnight with a radiolabeled 500-base pairEcoRI-SspI pHOT1 DNA fragment. The blot was washed 3 times for 20 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to film. Gel shift DNA band intensities were quantitated using a STORM 860 system and an image quantification program (ImageQuant; Molecular Dynamics). The effect of topoisomerase I in the presence of DNA damage was first examined by overexpressing this enzyme inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. A plasmid carrying the yeast topoisomerase I gene under the control of the inducible GAL1promoter (24Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was transformed into yeast strain CH335. The control cells for these experiments were CH335 cells transformed with the centromeric vector yCP50. Actively growing cells were exposed to MMS in SC-ura/GAL. MMS concentrations were selected that reduced the viability of wild type cells (cells not overexpressing Top1p) to about 10–100% after 1–3-h exposures. After exposure to MMS, cells were diluted and plated to SC-ura/Glu. The results obtained with MMS are shown in Fig.1. At different concentrations of MMS, cell survival was significantly lower in cells overexpressing Top1p than in cells carrying yCP50. A similar experiment was performed using yeast cells overexpressing human topoisomerase I from the yeastGAL1 promoter. Yeast cells overexpressing hTOP1 were also more sensitive to the killing effects of MMS than cells that did not overexpress TOP1 (data not shown). Thus, the results obtained appear to be general for type 1B topoisomerases and are not due to peculiar properties of yeast topoisomerase I. The enhanced sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents was not confined to simple alkylating agents. Similar results were obtained with other types of DNA damage. Yeast cells overexpressing Top1p exposed to either UV light or ionizing radiation exhibited significantly reduced survival when compared with cells carrying the control plasmid yCP50 (Fig.2, panels A andB). Interestingly, a somewhat different pattern of sensitivity was seen with cells that express E. coli topoisomerase I, a type IA enzyme. Cells expressing E. coli topA from the yeastGAL1 promoter had slightly greater sensitivity to MMS than control cells (Fig. 3). The difference in sensitivity at 0.04% MMS was statistically significant, whereas the difference at 0.08% MMS was not statistically significant. Although expression of a type IA enzyme causes a slight increase in sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, the effect is considerably smaller than seen when eukaryotic type 1B enzymes are overexpressed. We next examined whether the sensitization of cells by TOP1overexpression requires that the protein be active and able to cleave DNA. We introduced a plasmid carrying a mutant of TOP1 where the active site tyrosine (Tyr-727 (30Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) was mutated to phenylalanine. The mutant TOP1 gene was also under the control of theGAL1 promoter (31Eng W.K. Pandit S.D. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13373-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the results obtained with the active TOP1 gene, expression of the Y727F mutant did not sensitize cells to MMS (Fig. 4). It is also noteworthy that the Y727F mutant had a similar effect on growth in the absence of MMS as overexpression of the active TOP1 gene (compare Fig. 1 and Fig. 4). This result shows that the observed sensitization by TOP1 overexpression is not due to a reduction in growth rate or decreased plating efficiency whenTOP1 is overexpressed. When topoisomerase II is transcribed at the high levels expressed from the GAL1promoter, cells are unable to successfully undergo cell division. To examine the effects of topoisomerase II overexpression in the presence of DNA-damaging agents, a plasmid containing the topoisomerase II gene in front of the constitutive promoter DED1 was transformed into yeast (10Nitiss J.L. Liu Y.X. Harbury P. Jannatipour M. Wasserman R. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4467-4472PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with MMS, and survival was measured. The results, shown in Fig. 5, indicate that expression of the yeast TOP2 gene from theDED1 promoter does not lead to an increase in sensitivity to MMS. Similar results were obtained with UV and ionizing radiation (data not shown). These results suggest that the increase in sensitivity to DNA damage that is observed with topoisomerase overexpression is limited to type I topoisomerases. Since topoisomerase I has been implicated in transcription (32Brill S.J. DiNardo S. Voelkel-Meiman K. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1987; 326: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 33Merino A. Madden K.R. Lane W.S. Champoux J.J. Reinberg D. Nature. 1993; 365: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), a plausible model for the effects of topoisomerase I on DNA damage response is an alteration in the expression levels of genes required for responding to DNA damage. A set of genes has been identified in yeast whose transcription is increased after DNA damage (34Ruby S.W. Szostak J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 35Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We examined the transcription of one such gene, RAD54, which is inducible by MMS. CH335 cells carrying pGALTOP1 were treated with MMS in either glucose or galactose, and at various times after MMS addition, aliquots were removed for RNA isolation. The RNA was electrophoresed, and after transfer to a nylon membrane, probed with full-length RAD54 DNA. The results are shown in Fig. 6. In glucose in the absence of MMS, RAD54 mRNA is barely detectable. After a 1- or 3-h exposure to 0.05% MMS, there is a clear induction of theRAD54 message. Similarly, RAD54 message is barely detectable in galactose grown cells in the absence of MMS. This suggests that overexpression of TOP1 from theGAL1 promoter by itself is insufficient to elicit the induction of RAD54. Upon the addition of MMS,RAD54 message is induced to an extent similar to that seen with glucose-grown cells. Similar results were also obtained with the gene for a subunit of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (data not shown). These results indicate that overexpression of TOP1 does not increase the sensitivity of cells to DNA-damaging agents by changing gene expression. If cells with elevated levels of topoisomerase I are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents, then it seemed plausible that cells completely lacking topoisomerase I have elevated resistance to DNA damage. In addition, Muller and co-workers suggested that topoisomerase I plays a role in repair, based on the detection of trapped topoisomerase I (36Subramanian D. Rosenstein B.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 976-984PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the sensitivity of isogenic TOP1+ and top1− cells to MMS. For clarity, only the results after a 3-h exposure to MMS are shown in Fig.7. It is clear that the sensitivity of TOP1+ and top1− cells to MMS under these conditions is the same. Similar sensitivities to UV and ionizing radiation were also found (data not shown). Our results indicate that wild type levels of topoisomerase I expression do not sensitize cells to DNA damage nor does topoisomerase I play a detectable role in repair for these DNA-damaging agents. These results agree with a previous determination of the sensitivity of top1− cells to DNA damage (37Boreham D.R. Trivedi A. Weinberger P. Mitchel R.E. Radiat. Res. 1990; 123: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previous reports discussed in the Introduction have shown that mammalian topoisomerase I can be trapped on DNA carrying various types of DNA damage. We next wanted to confirm that yeast topoisomerase I could also be trapped by DNA damage. We first carried out a simple assay to test whether there was preferential nicking of damaged DNA by DNA topoisomerase I. Purified yeast topoisomerase I was incubated with end-labeled DNA that was either unirradiated or UV-irradiated with 1000 J/m2. After incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with SDS, protein-DNA complexes were precipitated by the addition of excess KCl, and the samples were washed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Topoisomerase I that was trapped as a covalent complex caused the bound DNA to precipitate, whereas free DNA remained in the supernatant. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 8. The addition of camptothecin to unirradiated DNA samples increased the level of topoisomerase I-DNA complexes that can be precipitated in the presence of potassium and SDS. Similarly, using DNA irradiated with 1000 J/m2 UV light in the absence of camptothecin also efficiently trapped topoisomerase I. In fact, the UV-damaged DNA trapped topoisomerase I as effectively as camptothecin. We also observed that the addition of camptothecin to samples containing irradiated DNA further increased trapping by topoisomerase I over the level seen with UV-irradiated DNA in the absence of camptothecin. To be able to examine cleavage under a wider range of conditions or with DNA substrates containing different types of DNA damage, we adapted the concept of changing the electrophoretic mobility of DNA upon protein binding to measure protein-DNA covalent complexes. In a standard electrophoretic mobility shift assay, protein and DNA are co-incubated, and then the reaction mixture is analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Detection of protein-DNA complexes when the interactions are noncovalent requires that the interaction remain stable under the electrophoresis conditions. Since we were interested in quantitating covalent protein-DNA interactions, it seemed likely that electrophoretic mobility shift would be able to readily detect topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes. To assess this, we examined the ability of topoisomerase I to reduce the mobility of linear DNA that was either unirradiated or irradiated with different UV doses. Fig.9 A shows the result of the electrophoresis. As can be readily seen, a weak shifted band can be observed in samples containing 6 units of topoisomerase I and unirradiated DNA. The addition of camptothecin greatly increased the intensity of the shifted band. If instead of camptothecin, UV-irradiated DNA was used, a significant increase in intensity of the shifted band was also observed. The intensities of the bands with unirradiated DNA, DNA irradiated with 1000 J/m2, or 2000 J/m2 UV is shown in Fig. 9 B. The intensity of the band is approximately linear with respect to added topoisomerase I over the range examined for all three DNA samples. The slope of the calculated linear regression is 2.8-fold higher for DNA irradiated with 1000 J/m2 than for unirradiated DNA and 5.3-fold higher for DNA irradiated with 2000 J/m2. Since the reactions were treated with SDS before electrophoresis, the interactions between topoisomerase I and damaged DNA that we detect must be covalent rather than noncovalent. To verify that the shifted bands represent protein-DNA complexes, we also treated one set of samples containing the highest amount of topoisomerase I with proteinase K before electrophoresis. Treatment with proteinase K resulted in complete loss of the shifted band whether complexes were trapped with camptothecin or UV damage. The results of Figs. 8 and 9 taken together demonstrate that UV-damaged DNA can efficiently trap topoisomerase I covalent complexes. Anti-cancer drugs such as camptothecin are able to trap a covalent intermediate of the topoisomerase I reaction, and trapping of this intermediate can interfere with DNA metabolism. It is well established that the cytotoxicity of camptothecin depends on its ability to stabilize topoisomerase I-cleavable complexes and that the degree of cytotoxicity correlates with the levels of covalent complexes (9Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For camptothecin-induced topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, processes such as DNA replication can convert the (reversible) protein-DNA lesion into an irreversible lesion (38Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). DNA replication also can convert the single-strand break formed by topoisomerase I into a double-strand break (39Tsao Y.P. Russo A. Nyamuswa G. Silber R. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5908-5914PubMed Google Scholar). Both the protein-DNA “adduct” and the generation of secondary double-strand breaks could contribute to camptothecin cytotoxicity. It is therefore plausible that other agents that increase the level of topoisomerase I-cleavable complexes are likely to be cytotoxic by the same mechanisms. In this paper, we demonstrate that in the presence of DNA damage, topoisomerase I also forms a stable covalent complex similar to the cleavable complexes formed in the presence of the anti-cancer drug camptothecin and that these covalent complexes enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA damage. Several trivial explanations for the hypersensitivity of cells expressing topoisomerase I to DNA-damaging agents can be readily excluded. Although cells overexpressing topoisomerase I grow more slowly than cells expressing normal levels of this enzyme, cells expressing a catalytically dead topoisomerase I also grow more slowly than wild type cells, but those cells are not hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents. Since both yeast and human topoisomerase I expression leads to drug hypersensitivity, the sensitization to DNA-damaging agents does not arise from either a peculiar property of one of the enzymes or from the expression of a heterologous enzyme. Using two different assays we have established that yeast topoisomerase I can be efficiently trapped on UV-damaged DNA. First we used the potassium/SDS assay, which was applied to measure protein DNA-covalent complexes trapped by topoisomerase poisons both in vivo andin vitro (40Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Trask D.K. DiDonato J.A. Muller M.T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 42Danks M.K. Schmidt C.A. Cirtain M.C. Suttle D.P. Beck W.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8861-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Second we directly examined the levels of protein-DNA complexes using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Both assays gave quantitatively similar results when similar samples were examined. The potassium/SDS assay indicated a 3-fold increase in covalent complexes with 1000 J/m2 UV versus∼5-fold with the mobility shift assay. A potential advantage of the mobility shift assay is the ability to examine DNA with several different types of DNA damage. The shortcoming of the potassium SDS assay is the necessity of separately labeling each DNA that has a different type or amount of DNA damage. Other recent studies also indicate that DNA damage is able to stabilize topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes in vitro. Pedrini and co-workers (13Lanza A. Tornaletti S. Rodolfi C. Scanavini M. Pedrini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6978-6986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) first showed that purified topoisomerase I stably cleaves UV-damaged DNA at sites at or near UV damage (13Lanza A. Tornaletti S. Rodolfi C. Scanavini M. Pedrini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6978-6986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pommier and co-workers (44Bhatia K. Pommier Y. Giri C. Fornace A.J. Imaizumi M. Breitman T.R. Cherney B.W. Smulson M.E. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) also find that topoisomerase I can form a stable covalent complex at the sites of several different specific DNA lesions. Earlier results had shown that factors such as DNA curvature could stimulate topoisomerase I cleavage (43Krogh S. Mortensen U.H. Westergaard O. Bonven B.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that topoisomerase I could act at sites of DNA breaks. Taken together, these results suggest that topoisomerase I action can be altered by many different changes in DNA structure. If the normal reaction of topoisomerase I at sites of DNA damage did not lead to further DNA damage, topoisomerase I could act as an efficient sensor of DNA lesions. Because the enzyme acting at damage results in a more complex lesion, the recognition of damage by topoisomerase I does not seem to be useful for promoting cell survival. Results described here that cells completely lacking topoisomerase I are not more sensitive to DNA damage than cells with wild type levels of the enzyme suggest that DNA damage recognition does not appear to be a normal indispensable role for this enzyme. Osheroff and co-workers (19Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) find that some types of DNA damage can also lead to trapping of topoisomerase II on DNA. In their studies, abasic sites greatly stimulated topoisomerase II cleavage of DNA. Since we failed to observe decreased survival in cells overexpressing topoisomerase II, the trapping of topoisomerase II by DNA damage either occurs infrequently in vivo, or cells possess an efficient system for preventing topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage. In results to be presented elsewhere, we have found that topoisomerase II levels increase after DNA damage, which leads us to suggest that trapping of topoisomerase II in vivo is a relatively infrequent event. It may be relatively infrequent for two reasons. First, topoisomerase II cleavage is strongly inhibited by some types of DNA damage such as photoproducts induced by UV light. Second, the DNA repair systems that recognize abasic sites may be much more efficient at binding to abasic sites than topoisomerase II. If so, then cells lacking apurinic endonucleases may become sensitive to topoisomerase II dosage. We are currently testing this hypothesis. How then do cells deal with the dangerous activity of topoisomerase I when DNA is damaged? In mammalian cells, polyADP-ribose polymerase is rapidly activated by DNA strand breaks (44Bhatia K. Pommier Y. Giri C. Fornace A.J. Imaizumi M. Breitman T.R. Cherney B.W. Smulson M.E. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A major target for poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase is topoisomerase I, and modification of topoisomerase I by this enzyme inhibits topoisomerase activity (45Ferro A.M. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 547-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,46Ferro A.M. McElwain M.C. Olivera B.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Yeast cells apparently lack this enzyme, so some other pathway must function to attenuate topoisomerase I activity after DNA damage. The inactivation of topoisomerase I should occur fairly rapidly to prevent the formation of covalent complexes at sites of damage. Either covalent modification or targeted degradation could rapidly inactivate topoisomerase I after DNA damage. At present we do not know whether yeast topoisomerase I is rapidly degraded or whether other processes are able to inhibit the activity of the enzyme. Liu and co-workers (47Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar,48Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) show that human topoisomerase I is modified by the proteins of the ubiquitin family including small ubiquitin-related modifier after camptothecin treatment, suggesting that either degradation or inactivation of topoisomerase I can be part of the cell response to DNA damage. However, the activity and altered stability of topoisomerase I conjugated to small ubiquitin-related modifier remains to be demonstrated (49Kretz-Remy C. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, down-regulation of topoisomerase I after ionizing radiation has also been reported (50Boothman D.A. Fukunaga N. Wang M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4618-4626PubMed Google Scholar). There are likely other pathways that control topoisomerase I after DNA damage as well as pathways that can repair the DNA damage arising from topoisomerase I. Nash and co-workers (51Yang S.W. Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 52Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Science. 1999; 286: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) recently describe a yeast protein that can disjoin topoisomerase I covalent complexes. Since DNA damage and not just topoisomerase I poisons such as camptothecin are able to trap topoisomerase I on DNA, the enzyme described by Nash likely functions as one DNA repair system designed to deal with the ability of topoisomerase I to generate covalent complexes at the sites of damage. Our results connect topoisomerase I to pathways of DNA damage repair and DNA damage tolerance, but the connection we propose is not that topoisomerases participate in repair but, rather, as an impediment to accurate repair. It has also been found that overexpression of topoisomerase I is able to increase nonhomologous integration of transfected DNA in yeast (53Zhu J. Schiestl R.H. Mol. Cell.

This step is catalyzed by the viral reverse transcriptase (RT), a heterodimer composed of a 66-kDa (p66) and a 51-kDa (p51) subunit. Subdomains within each subunit are termed “fingers,” “palm,” “thumb,” and “connection” based on x-ray crystal structure and standard subdomain classification in various polymerases (1Kohlstaedt L.A.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heterodimer is generated after the viral protease cleaves one of the RNase H domains of an asymmetric p66/p66 homodimer (3Di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R. Oroszlan S.

The DNA-binding cleft and polymerase active-site residues are exposed in the “open” conformation of p66. On the other hand, the p51 subunit is closely folded, with its catalytic residues occupying an internal position in the molecule (1Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A.

In addition to providing structural support to the p66 subunit, p51 appears to be required for loading of the p66 subunit onto the template-primer (7Harris D. Lee R. Misra H.S. Pandey P.K.

It has also been reported that the p66/p51 heterodimer as compared with the p66/p66 homodimer displays higher processivity and strand displacement activity during DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (12Huang S.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 986-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the process of dimerization and subsequent maturation into the p66/p51 heterodimer is essential for a fully functional RT and constitutes a target for therapeutic intervention.Peptides mimicking the dimer interface of p66 and p51 have been used to prevent heterodimer formation (14Divita G. Restle T. Goody R.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Divita G. Restle T. Goody R.S. Chermann J.-C. Baillon J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13080-13083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, certain non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as [1-[2′,5′-bis-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-β-d-ribofuranosyl]-N 3-ethylthymine]-3′-spiro-5“-(4”-amino-1“,2”-oxathiole-2“,2”-dioxide), are known to produce a modest, but significant destabilizing effect on the heterodimer (16Sluis-Cremer N. Dmitrienko G.I. Balzarini J. Camarasa M.-J. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the molecular determinants of heterodimer stability are not known. Single-amino acid substitutions in HIV-1 RT, such as W229A, G231A, L234A, and L289K, have been shown to inhibit heterodimer association (17Goel R. Beard W.A. Kumar A. Casas-Finet J.R. Strub M.-P.

These substitutions mediate their effects through the 66-kDa subunit, but were not found at the dimer interface of p66 and p51, suggesting an indirect conformational effect on dimer stability. Further confirmation of the role of Leu-234 in dimerization was obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system (20Tachedjian G. Aronson H.-E.G. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6334-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using this approach, it appears that the fingers and palm subdomains of p66 are dispensable for p51 interaction. Deletion of 25 or 26 amino acids at the C terminus of p51 prevented dimerization, as demonstrated in reconstitution experiments with wild-type p66 and using the two-hybrid system (8Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Howard K.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tachedjian G. Aronson H.-E.G. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6334-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences obtained throughout the world has identified three genetically distinct groups designated as major (M), outlier (O), and non-M non-O (N). Nucleotide sequence diversity between these groups can be as high as 35% in the envelope-coding region. This is considerably more than the 10–20% sequence diversity separating HIV-1 group M subtypes (A–J), but comparable to the 40–50% nucleotide sequence diversity separating HIV-1 and HIV-2. With the exception of some sporadic infections in Western Europe and the United States, the prevalence of the highly divergent, rare HIV-1 group O is greatest in central Africa (i.e. Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria) (reviewed in Ref. 21Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Ball S.C. Arts E.J. AIDS Rev. 2000; 2: 190-202Google Scholar). In a preliminary study, we reported on the expression and characterization of an HIV-1 group O RT (ESP1 isolate) (22Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Soriano V. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. Virology. 1997; 236: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ESP1 RT shares 79% amino acid sequence identity with the RT of group M:subtype B strain BH10. The two enzymes show very similar kinetics of DNA polymerization and RNase H activity, and both are equally sensitive to nucleoside analog inhibitors such as dideoxythymidine triphosphate and 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine triphosphate. ESP1 RT is resistant to NNRTIs, in agreement with other reports showing that most of HIV-1 group O isolates are naturally resistant to NNRTIs (i.e. nevirapine, delavirdine, and the TIBO derivative R82913) (23Descamps D. Collin G. Letourneur F. Apetrei C. Damond F. Loussert-Ajaka I. Simon F. Saragosti S. Brun-Vézinet F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8893-8898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of Cys-181 in the group O RT-coding region, instead of the Tyr-181 found in sensitive group M:subtype B (M:B) strains, appears to confer NNRTI resistance (22Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Soriano V. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. Virology. 1997; 236: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Descamps D. Collin G. Letourneur F. Apetrei C. Damond F. Loussert-Ajaka I. Simon F. Saragosti S. Brun-Vézinet F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8893-8898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, detailed studies on the enzymatic activity of HIV-1ESP1 and related M:B/O RT chimeras was hampered by the poor level of HIV-1ESP1 group O subunit expression, reconstitution, and purification. In this study, we initially screened for optimum Escherichia coli expression of the group O p66 subunit using 66 group O RT variants derived from quasi-species of six different isolates (24Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Albright J.L. Mas A. Soriano V. Arts E.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9002-9015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p66 subunits of group O (p66O) or wild-type group M:subtype B (p66M:B) RTs were then reconstituted and purified with either p51O or p51M:B subunits to compare DNA polymerase activity, initiation of (−)-strand DNA synthesis, NNRTI sensitivity, and heterodimer stability. In general, chimeric heterodimers (i.e. p66M:B/p51O and p66O/p51M:B) were indistinguishable from the natural RTs (p66M:B/p51M:B or p66O/p51O) and showed comparable DNA polymerase activity. However, both the group O p66 and p51 subunits in the chimeras appeared to contribute to NNRTI resistance. The role of possible alterations in the proper heterodimer conformation is highlighted by the inability of the p66M:B/p51Oand p66O/p51M:B RTs to efficiently utilize tRNA 3Lys as a primer on an HIV-1 group O or group M:subtype B RNA template.DISCUSSIONMost information on anti-retroviral drug efficacy has been obtained from infections or in vitro studies with HIV-1 group M:subtype B, the prevalent subtype in countries with access to anti-retroviral drugs. Recent studies show a fortuitous but understandable anti-retroviral inhibition of other group M, non-clade B HIV-1 isolates that currently circulate throughout the developing world (23Descamps D. Collin G. Letourneur F. Apetrei C. Damond F. Loussert-Ajaka I. Simon F. Saragosti S. Brun-Vézinet F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8893-8898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Albright J.L.

Retroviruses. 1998; 14: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 isolates display natural resistance to nevirapine and other NNRTIs (22Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Soriano V. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. Virology. 1997; 236: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Descamps D. Collin G. Letourneur F. Apetrei C. Damond F. Loussert-Ajaka I. Simon F. Saragosti S. Brun-Vézinet F. J.

Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 can infect humans and cause AIDS, although the prevalence of those viruses is low and mostly restricted to West Africa. Structural analyses of the NNRTI-binding site of HIV-1 RT and genotypic analyses of nevirapine-resistant M:B isolates suggest that residues such as Cys-181 in the p66 subunit are likely to be responsible for the intrinsic HIV-1 group O resistance to NNRTIs. However, the contribution of the p51 subunit to NNRTI resistance by group O isolates has not been determined.Expression and purification of chimeric group O/group M:subtype B RT heterodimers (i.e. p66M:B/p51O and p66O/p51M:B) were rather efficient, and purification yields were similar or better than for the natural heterodimers (i.e. p66M:B/p51M:B and p66O/p51O). As shown in Fig.7, residues involved in p66/p51 interactions are highly conserved in the RTs of HIV-1 groups O and M, as well as in HIV-2. However, attempts to reconstitute chimeric RTs from separately expressed or coexpressed HIV-1 and HIV-2 subunits resulted in very inefficient and unstable heterodimer formation (40Howard K.J. Frank K.B. Sim I.S. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23003-23009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,43Müller B. Restle T. Kühnel H. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14709-14713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although structural incompatibility between the different RT subunits could have affected the stability of HIV-1/HIV-2 RT heterodimers, low levels of expression and/or higher sensitivity to degradation by bacterial proteases may have also contributed to the poor recovery of the reconstituted chimeras. In contrast, other groups have obtained active chimeric heterodimers composed of HIV-1 and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RT subunits (i.e.p66HIV-1/p51FIV and p66FIV/p51HIV-1) (44Amacker M. Hübscher U. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This was somewhat surprising considering the relatively high number of amino acid sequence differences between FIV and HIV-1 (<70% sequence identity) and that the FIV RT lacks the Trp-rich sequence found in the connection subdomain of HIV-1 RT (see residues 401–410 in Fig. 7). This region is found at the dimer interface in crystal structures of HIV-1 RT (6Wang J. Smerdon S.J. Jäger J. Kohlstaedt L.A. Rice P.A. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and constitutes a potential target for peptide inhibitors of RT dimerization (15Divita G. Restle T. Goody R.S. Chermann J.-C. Baillon J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13080-13083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that formation of chimeric heterodimers is mainly affected by structural compatibility, rather than by sequence identity at the dimer interface.RT inhibition experiments showed that the chimeric p66O/p51M:B RT and the homologous p66O/p51O RT were resistant to nevirapine, TSAO-T, and TSAO-m3T. Unlike nevirapine, TSAO derivatives have been shown to destabilize the p66/p51 HIV-1 RT heterodimer (16Sluis-Cremer N. Dmitrienko G.I. Balzarini J. Camarasa M.-J. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) through binding to regions in the p51 subunit involved in RT dimerization. Chimeric heterodimers consisting of the p66 subunit of HIV-1 subtype B (clone BH10) and the p51 subunit of group O (ESP2 clone 46) were partially resistant to nevirapine and TSAO derivatives. However, increases in inhibition constants were similar when the chimeric p66M:B/p51O RT was used in the assay in the place of the homologous p66M:B/p51M:BRT. This result implies that differences in amino acid sequence between the ESP2 and BH10 RTs may also encode NNRTI resistance through the ESP2 p51 subunit rather than solely through the ESP2 p66 subunit. The substitution of Lys for Glu-138 confers genotypic resistance to TSAO derivatives in group M:subtype B isolates (45Balzarini J. Karlsson A. Vandamme A.-M. Pérez-Pérez M.-J. Zhang H. Vrang L. Öberg B. Bäckbro K. Unge T. San-Félix A. Velázquez S. Camarasa M.-J. De Clercq E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6952-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, phenotypic resistance is restricted to the catalytically inactive p51 subunit in the heterodimer (46Jonckheere H. Taymans J.-M. Balzarini J. Velázquez S. Camarasa M.-J. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Anné J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25255-25258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RT-coding region of HIV-1 group O does not encode Lys-138 or any other mutations conferring NNRTI resistance through the p51 subunit. Currently, this partial resistance to nevirapine and TSAO derivatives mediated by the group O p51 subunit in the p66M:B/p51O heterodimer cannot be attributed to any specific amino acid residue.Stability of the heterodimeric RTs was determined by comparing the DNA polymerase activities of enzymes pretreated with increasing concentrations of urea. Previous studies revealed that homologous HIV-2 RT heterodimers are more stable than those of HIV-1 RT upon exposure to organic solvents (14Divita G. Restle T. Goody R.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 47Divita G. Rittinger K. Restle T. Immendörfer U. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16337-16346Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of each subunit to stability was not measured. In our study, HIV-1 group O RT heterodimers were significantly more stable than M:B RT heterodimers. Furthermore, our analysis of chimeric RTs predicts that the molecular determinants of greater heterodimer stability lie within the p51 subunit rather than in the catalytically active p66 subunit. The role of p51 in heterodimer stability is supported by (i) studies showing reduced stability of heterodimers containing p51 with C-terminal deletions (8Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Howard K.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tachedjian G. Aronson H.-E.G. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6334-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and (ii) structural analyses showing a greater contribution of p51 to the dimer interface via an interaction between the p51 subunit (i.e.fingers, connection, and thumb subdomains) with a more limited region in the p66 subunit (i.e. palm subdomain, connection subdomain, and RNase H domain) (Fig. 7). The partial resistance to NNRTIs shown by the chimeric p66M:B/p51O RT suggests that intersubunit interactions favor a p51O-induced conformation over a p66M:B-induced conformation in this chimeric heterodimer. The p51 subunit of HIV-1 group O RT may also cause a significant perturbation in the NNRTI-binding site of p66M:B/p51O RT, probably by altering interactions between the fingers subdomain of p51 and the palm subdomain of p66.We have previously shown that initiation of reverse transcription in HIV-1 group M:subtype B can be significantly impaired by single-amino acid substitutions (48Arts E.J. Miller J.T. Ehresmann B. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although natural group M:subtype B and group O RTs share only 79% sequence identity (22Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Soriano V. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. Virology. 1997; 236: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), both enzymes are able to catalyze (−)-strand DNA synthesis from a short oligonucleotide DNA and tRNA 3Lys annealed to either an HIV-1 group O or M:B-derived RNA template. In contrast, other lentiviral RTs, including HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus heterodimeric RTs, cannot efficiently catalyze (−)-strand DNA synthesis from tRNA 3Lys annealed to HIV-1 RNA (37Arts E.J. Stetor S.R. Li X. Rausch J.W. Howard K.J. Ehresmann B. North T.W. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Wainberg M.A. Le Grice S.F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10063-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These lentiviral non-HIV-1 RTs can, however, (i) catalyze (−)-strand DNA synthesis from short oligonucleotide RNA or DNA primers and (ii) initiate reverse transcription from tRNA 3Lys annealed to FIV or equine infectious anemia virus RNA (37Arts E.J. Stetor S.R. Li X. Rausch J.W. Howard K.J. Ehresmann B. North T.W. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Wainberg M.A. Le Grice S.F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10063-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The A-rich loop in the HIV-1 pbs RNA interacts with the U-rich tRNA 3Lysanti-codon loop, leading to a bimolecular complex that may block other non-HIV-1 lentiviruses from utilizing primer tRNA 3Lys annealed to HIV-1 pbs RNA (35Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A disruption of this tRNA loop·HIV-1 RNA loop complex by deleting the A-rich region in the HIV-1 genomic RNA (HIV-1M:B pbsΔA RNA) also permits tRNA 3Lys utilization by other lentiviral RTs. In this study, HIV-2 RT could initiate (−)-strand DNA synthesis only when tRNA 3Lys was annealed to an HIV-1 RNA template lacking an A-rich sequence upstream of the pbs. Computer predictions of HIV-1 group M:subtype B, HIV-1 group O, and HIV-2 pbs RNA secondary structures suggest that the A-rich sequence may be accessible to the tRNA anti-codon loop in both HIV-1 group M and O RNAs, but not in HIV-2 RNA.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated that three basic residues (i.e. Lys-249, Arg-307, and Lys-311) in the p66 thumb subdomain, opposite to the template-primer-binding cleft, are involved in binding to the tRNA anti-codon loop. RT variants with either Gln or Glu at any of these positions have reduced affinity for tRNA 3Lys, alter interactions with the tRNA anti-codon loop, and support significantly less tRNA-primed (−)-strand DNA synthesis. These three residues are conserved in all HIV-1 group O and M isolates. Interestingly, HIV-2 RT, which has a serine at position 311, cannot initiate DNA synthesis from a tRNA 3Lys·HIV-1 pbs RNA complex,i.e. a result analogous to that obtained with the p66K311E/Q/p51 HIV-1 M:B enzyme (48Arts E.J. Miller J.T. Ehresmann B. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings unveil the coevolution of RNA and RT elements involved in the initiation of reverse transcription in HIV-1 groups O and M. This is remarkable considering that this conservation of function does not exist between HIV-1 and HIV-2, even though there is a comparable nucleotide sequence diversity between HIV-1 groups (30–35% nucleotide sequence diversity; O versus M) and HIV types (1 versus 2).Subtle conformational differences influence inhibitor sensitivity and heterodimer stability in the chimeric HIV-1 group M/group O RTs. However, these differences between the natural and chimeric group O and M:B RTs do not affect DNA- or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity using a nonspecific DNA·DNA template-primer as substrate. Use of a more complex and endogenous reverse transcription assay has revealed possible structural abnormalities in the chimeric group M/group O RTs. Although the polymerase activities of p66M:B/p51M:B, p66O/p51O, and p66M:B/p51O RTs were similar, the p66O/p51M:B RT showed only distributive synthesis using the same 18-nucleotide DNA primer·HIV-1 pbs RNA template as substrate. Even the p66M:B/p51O RT, which had wild-type activity, from the DNA primer was severely impaired in its ability to use tRNA 3Lys on the HIV-1 group O and M:B RNA templates. In contrast to the inability of wild-type HIV-2 RT to prime from tRNA 3Lys on an HIV-1 RNA template (Fig.3) (37Arts E.J. Stetor S.R. Li X. Rausch J.W. Howard K.J. Ehresmann B. North T.W. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Wainberg M.A. Le Grice S.F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10063-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), this defect with the M:B/O chimeras was not intrinsic to the natural HIV-1 group O RT, which could utilize tRNA 3Lys as a primer on both the HIV-1 group O and M:B RNA templates (Fig. 4). Instead, it appears that the reconstitution of these intergroup chimeras resulted in enzymes that were competent polymerases, but lacked the exact structural architecture to interact with tRNA 3Lys. Utilization of tRNA 3Lys on the HIV-1 RNA template is, however, a characteristic of both parental natural group M and O heterodimers. The importance of an exact p51 framework in the heterodimer is highlighted by studies showing that short deletions (13 amino acids) of the p51 C terminus can have drastic effects on tRNA 3Lys binding and initiation of (−)-strand DNA synthesis without affecting DNA polymerase activity (8Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Howard K.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, slightly longer deletions of the p51 C terminus prevent dimerization and recovery of reconstituted heterodimeric RT (8Jacques P.S. Wöhrl B.M. Howard K.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Tachedjian G. Aronson H.-E.G. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6334-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In summary, we found that heterodimeric RTs composed of highly divergent HIV-1 subtype B and group O RT subunits are functional during elongation of reverse transcription, with the p51 subunit contributing to heterodimer stability and inhibitor sensitivity. The mechanism of initiation of reverse transcription appears to be conserved in HIV-1 group M:subtype B and group O. On the other hand, chimeric RT heterodimers catalyzed little or no (−)-strand DNA synthesis, suggesting that specific p66/p51 interactions are critical for complex, retrovirus-specific RT functions. Synthesis of double-stranded DNA from the retroviral RNA genome is an essential step for replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1-1. This step is catalyzed by the viral reverse transcriptase (RT), a heterodimer composed of a 66-kDa (p66) and a 51-kDa (p51) subunit. Subdomains within each subunit are termed “fingers,” “palm,” “thumb,” and “connection” based on x-ray crystal structure and standard subdomain classification in various polymerases (1Kohlstaedt L.A.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heterodimer is generated after the viral protease cleaves one of the RNase H domains of an asymmetric p66/p66 homodimer (3Di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R. Oroszlan S.

We previously found a novel acyl-CoA synthetic pathway, ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis from phospholipids. We proposed that: 1) the ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis is due to the reverse reaction of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases and 2) the reverse and forward reactions of acyltransferases can combine to form a CoA-dependent transacylation system. To test these proposals, we examined whether or not recombinant mouse acyl-CoA:1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid, LPA) acyltransferase (LPAAT) could catalyze ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthetic activity and CoA-dependent transacylation activity. ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis was indeed found in the membrane fraction from Escherichia coli cells expressing mouse LPAAT, whereas negligible activity was observed in mock-transfected cells. Phosphatidic acid (PA), but not free fatty acids, served as an acyl donor for the reaction, and LPA was formed from PA in a CoA-dependent manner during acyl-CoA synthesis. These results indicate that the ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis was due to the reverse reaction of LPAAT. In addition, bacterial membranes containing LPAAT catalyzed CoA-dependent acylation of LPA; PA but not free fatty acid served as an acyl donor. These results indicate that the CoA-dependent transacylation of LPA consists of 1) acyl-CoA synthesis from PA through the reverse action of LPAAT and 2) the transfer of the fatty acyl moiety of the newly formed acyl-CoA to LPA through the forward reaction of LPAAT.

In mammalian cells and tissues, four types of acylation reactions for lysophospholipids have been proposed, based on the acyl donor and requirement for cofactors, such as CoA. These comprise: 1) acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase, 2) the CoA-dependent transacylation system, 3) the CoA-independent transacylation system and 4) lysophospholipase/transacylase. Acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases utilize acyl-CoA as an acyl donor and various lysophospholipids as acyl acceptors (1Lands W.E.M. Crawford C.G. Martonosi A.

It has been assumed that there are distinct acyl-CoA acyltransferases with different acyl acceptor specificities, although no conclusive data have been obtained yet. A CoA-dependent transacylation system was first reported by Irvine and Dawson (9Irvine R.F. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in rat liver. In this system, fatty acids esterified in phospholipids are transferred to lysophospholipids in the presence of CoA without the generation of free fatty acids (9Irvine R.F. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem.

The CoA-independent transacylation system is involved in the acylation of 1-O- alkyl-GPC (lysoplatelet-activating factor). Lysophospholipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester bonds of lysophospholipids (5Snyder F. Lee T.-C. Blank M.L. Prog.

Some lysophospholipase isoforms are known to catalyze a transacylation reaction between two LPC molecules, leading to the formation of a diacylphospholipid PC and GPC. Lysophospholipase/transacylase also does not require any cofactors such as CoA. The properties of the CoA-dependent transacylation system, including the reaction kinetics and donor and acceptor selectivities, have been studied (3Nakagawa Y. Waku K. Prog.

In fact, the identity of the enzymes responsible for CoA-dependent transacylation reactions has not been established. Although we and other investigators previously considered that acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases may be involved in CoA-dependent transacylation reactions (9Irvine R.F. Dawson R.M.C.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 440-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), direct and conclusive evidence has not been obtained because of the lack of success in purification and cloning of membrane-bound lysophospholipid acyltransferases and transacylases, including the CoA-dependent transacylation system. Previously, we demonstrated ATP-independent and CoA-dependent acyl-CoA synthesis in microsomal fractions of mammalian tissues (19Sugiura T. Kudo N. Ojima T. Mabuchi-Itoh K. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Sugiura T. Kudo N. Ojima T. Kondo S. Yamashita A. Waku K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 440-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No appreciable acyl-CoA was formed from free fatty acids under the same experimental conditions, indicating that this acyl-CoA synthesis is distinct from the well known acyl-CoA synthetase activity that ligates fatty acids and CoA in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. Lysophospholipids, such as LPC and LPI, are formed during acyl-CoA formation, suggesting a possible role of membrane phospholipids as fatty acyl donors. These findings prompt us to suggest that the reverse reactions of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases are involved in CoA-dependent/ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis and that the CoA-dependent transacylation system consists of the combination of the reverse and forward reactions of the acyltransferases (Scheme FS1). Genetic and molecular biological approaches have led to a breakthrough in the field of acyltransferases. An Escherichia coli mutant lacking acyl-CoA:1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (1-acyl-GP, lysophosphatidic acid) acyltransferase (LPAAT) was isolated (21Coleman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17215-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the corresponding gene (plsC gene) was subsequently cloned (22Coleman J. Mol. Gen.

Commun. 1997; 237: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). LPAATs are the first enzymes involved in the acylation of lysophospholipids to be cloned. In humans, there are known to be at least two genes, called LPAATα and LPAATβ. Although the two enzymes have similar sequences (35% amino acid identity), they exhibit distinct tissue distributions. The physiological significance of the presence of two enzymes and their comparative enzymology have not been elucidated. To establish the mechanism underlying ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis, we examined the enzymology of a recombinant acyltransferase in detail. We employed mouse LPA acyltransferase (mLPAAT) (27Kume K. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) because LPAAT was the first to be cloned and is currently the only available acyltransferase active toward lysophospholipids. This enzyme is the mouse homolog of the α type of human LPAAT. When the mLPAAT gene was expressed in JC201 E. coli cells lacking endogenous LPAAT activity (plsC mutant) (21Coleman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17215-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthetic activity was observed in the membrane fraction, with phosphatidic acid (PA) as the acyl donor. CoA-dependent synthesis of LPA from PA was also seen. These results suggest that mLPAAT can operate in reverse to form acyl-CoA and LPA. Furthermore, we observed CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward LPA in membranes containing mLPAAT. We conclude that the CoA-dependent transacylation activity toward LPA is due to the combination of the reverse and forward reactions of LPAAT and suggest that other acyltransferase systems may involve a similar mechanism.

[3H]LPI ([3H]inositol-labeled 1-acyl-GPI) was prepared from [3H]inositol-labeled PI by phospholipase A2 (Naja naja atra) treatment. All other reagents were of reagent grade. The cDNA clone of mLPAAT was isolated as described previously (27Kume K. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The whole open reading frame of clone 3 was excised and cloned into the pTrcHisC expression vector (Invitrogen) that contains a six-histidine sequence. The open reading frame was inserted in frame with the six histidine sequence to express an N-terminal His6 fusion protein. The expression vector containing the mLPAAT sequence (pTrc/mLPAAT) was transfected into JC201 cells (pls C mutant). JC201 cells harboring pTrc/mLPAAT were cultured in LB medium at 30 °C until theA 600 reached ∼0.6 and then cultured for an additional 3 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The pTicHisC vector without an insert was used as a negative control. After induction with IPTG, bacterial cells were collected by centifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min and then disrupted by sonication in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). The lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 × gfor 15 min to remove cell debris, and then the supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting membrane pellet was washed with the same buffer, and the final pellet was suspended in the same buffer and used for enzyme assays. The protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The expression of mLPAAT in E. coli was confirmed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against the penta-His sequence epitope (Qiagen). Briefly, membrane fractions from JC201 cells and JC201 cells harboring pTrc/mLPAAT cultured in the presence or the absence of IPTG were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% T, 2.6% C) and further blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran BA85; Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking the membrane with 5% bovine serum albumin, it was incubated with monoclonal antibody against the His5 sequence epitope. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) and ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membrane fractions from JC201 cells expressing mLPAAT were incubated with 30 µm [1-14C]linoleoyl (18:2 n-6)-CoA (40,000 dpm) and 40 µm LPA (1-oleoyl (18:1 n-9)) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for various periods at 30 °C. In some experiments, membranes from mock-transfected JC201 cells were used. The reactions were terminated by the addition of three volumes of chloroform:methanol (1:2 v/v). After the addition of unlabeled PA as a carrier, total lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) under acidic conditions (0.6 n HCl). Total lipids were separated by TLC developed with chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (65:25:4:2 v/v/v/v). The band corresponding to PA was visualized under UV light after spraying with primuline (0.001%, in acetone:water, 4:1 v/v) and then scraped from the plate into a counting vial. The radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation spectrometer (LSC-3500; Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). For examination of the acyl acceptor specificity of mLPAAT, various lysophospholipids were substituted for LPA. In the case of examination of acyl donor specificity, [14C]LPA was used as the radiolabeled substrate instead of [14C]linoleoyl-CoA with various unlabeled fatty acids or acyl-CoA as the acyl donor. ATP-independent acyl-CoA synthesis was measured as described previously (15Sugiura T. Masuzawa Y. Waku K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17490-17498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sugiura T. Kudo N. Ojima T. Mabuchi-Itoh K. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochim. Biophys.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 440-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Membrane fractions (0.5 mg) from JC201 cells expressing mLPAAT were incubated with 25 µm[14C]PA (1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl, 110,000 dpm) in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1% bovine serum albumin containing various concentrations of CoA (0–1000 µm) for 30 min at 30 °C. As a control, the membrane fraction from mock-transfected JC201 cells was incubated under the same conditions. In some cases, the effects of MgCl2, ATP, apyrase, and CoA analogs on acyl-CoA generation by mLPAAT were tested. The membrane fractions from JC201 cells expressing mLPAAT were incubated with 25 µm[14C]PA and 500 µm CoA containing 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and/or 0.5 unit/ml apyrase. The membrane fractions were incubated with 25 µm[14C]PA and 500 µm desulfo-CoA or dephospho-CoA. The reaction was stopped by the addition of chloroform:methanol (1:2 v/v). After the addition of unlabeled palmitoyl-CoA as a carrier, acyl-CoA was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). The water-methanol layer was washed three times with chloroform to remove chloroform-soluble materials and then evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas. The residue containing acyl-CoA was dissolved in a small volume of ethanol:water (4:1 v/v) and then applied on a TLC plate with a fluorescent indicator. The TLC plate was developed with n-butanol:acetic acid:water (5:2:3 v/v/v). The radiolabeled acyl-CoA ([14C]linoleoyl-CoA) was separated from the substrate (2-[14C]linoleoyl-PA) and byproducts ([14C]linoleic acid, 2-[14C]linoleoyl-LPA, and 2-[14C]linoleoyl mono and diacylglycerols) by extraction and purification of acyl-CoA. The acyl-CoA band was also visualized under UV light (254 nm). In some cases, the acyl-CoA band was visualized under UV light (365 nm) after spraying with primuline. The radioactivity of the acyl-CoA band was determined with an imaging analyzer (Fuji-BAS 1500; Fuji Film) or a liquid scintillation spectrometer. In the assay with an unlabeled substrate, the membrane fractions were incubated with 1 mm CoA and 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of various donor lipids (PA (dioleoyl), PC (1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl), PE (bovine liver), PI (bovine liver, mainly 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl), or a free fatty acid (linoleic acid), 300 µm) for 30 min at 30 °C. After stopping the reaction, acyl-CoA was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). The water-methanol layer was taken and washed three times with chloroform. After the methanol in the water-methanol layer had been evaporated off under a stream of nitrogen gas, the remainder was diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and applied to a Sep-pak Plus C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). After washing the cartridge with 2 ml of 20% acetonitrile, 80% Tris-HCl buffer, acyl-CoA was eluted with 2 ml of 70% acetonitrile, 30% Tris-HCl buffer. Fatty acyl-CoA esters were quantified by 1) measurement of phosphate (31Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), 2) absorption of the adenine moiety (260 nm), and 3) colorimetry (413 nm) of thiol with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) after hydrolysis of the thioester bonds with hydroxylamine (32Steinman H.M. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 892-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of acyl-CoA was further confirmed by TLC. The membrane fractions from mock- or mLPAAT-transfected JC201 cells were incubated with 50 µm [14C]PA ([U-14C]glycerol-labeled dipalmitoyl-PA, 440,000 dpm) in the presence or the absence of 50 µm CoA for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture included 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and a membrane fraction. In some cases, the concentration of CoA was varied. In most cases, unlabeled LPA was added to the assay system, because unlabeled LPA enhanced the [14C]LPA formation. When the substrate specificity was examined, various PA species, such as 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-myristoyl, 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-palmitoyl, 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-stearoyl, 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl, 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl, 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl, and 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleolyl, were used as substrates. After stopping the reaction, LPA was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer under acidic conditions (0.6 nHCl). LPA was separated by TLC developed with chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (65:25:4:2 v/v/v/v), and the radioactivity was determined with an imaging analyzer or a liquid scintillation spectrometer. CoA-dependent transacylation activity was measured as the conversion of [14C]LPA to [14C]PA in the presence of CoA. Membrane fractions from JC201 cells expressing mLPAAT were incubated with 40 µm[14C]LPA (1-[14C]palmitoyl-GP, 50,000 dpm) in the presence or the absence of 50 µm CoA in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 30 °C. In some cases, various phospholipids, such as PA, PC, PE, and PI, were added as a donor lipid to the assay mixture. The reactions were terminated by the addition of three volumes of chloroform:methanol (1:2 v/v). After the addition of unlabeled PA as a carrier, total lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) under acidic conditions (0.6n HCl). Total lipids were separated by TLC developed with chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (65:25:4:2 v/v/v/v) as the solvent system. The band corresponding to PA was visualized under UV light after spraying with primuline and then scraped from the plate. The radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. In some cases, transacylation activity toward [14C]LPC or [3H]LPI was examined by means of similar procedures. First, we expressed mouse LPAAT in JC201 E. coli cells under regulation by thetrc (trp-lac) promoter. E. coli plsC mutant JC201 lacks LPAAT activity (21Coleman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17215-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of mLPAAT was examined by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against the penta-His sequence epitope. The molecular mass of mLPAAT was calculated to be 32 kDa from the cDNA sequence (27Kume K. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2028767015,"Based on sequence homology with the previously cloned human cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) cDNA, a novel sulfotransferase was cloned by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library. The novel sulfotransferase gene was present on human chromosome 11q13; the location was different from human CST and from that of the recently cloned human β-Gal 3′-sulfotransferase (GP3ST). The isolated cDNA contained an open reading frame that encoded a predicted protein of 431 amino acid residues with type II transmembrane topology. The amino acid sequence showed 33% identity with that of human CST and 38% with that of human GP3ST. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells catalyzed transfer of sulfate to position 3 of non-reducing β-galactosyl residues in Galβ1–4GlcNAc. Type 2 chains served as good acceptors, whereas type 1 chains served as poor acceptors, and intermediate activity was found toward Galβ1–3GalNAc. Therefore, the substrate specificity was different from that of GP3ST. CST activity was not detected in the newly cloned enzyme. Northern blotting analysis showed that the sulfotransferase mRNA was strongly expressed in the thyroid and moderately expressed in the brain, heart, kidney, and spinal cord. Co-transfection of the enzyme cDNA and fucosyltransferase III into COS-7 cells resulted in expression of (SO4-3)Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc and a small amount of (SO4-3)Galβ1–3(Fucα1–4)GlcNAc. These results indicated that the newly cloned enzyme is a novel Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase and is involved in biosynthesis of the (SO4-3)Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc structure.

In addition to sulfatide, carbohydrates with 3′-sulfated β-Gal linkages are present in both O-glycans (6Lo-Guidice J.-M. Wieruszeski J.-M. Lemoine J. Verbert A. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol.

Recently, (SO4-3)Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc (3′-sulfo LeX)1and (SO4-3)Galβ1–3(Fucα1–4)GlcNAc (3′-sulfo Lea) containing 3-O-sulfated Gal residues at the non-reducing end were reported to be effective ligands for E- and L-selectins (8Chai W.

Notably, 3′-sulfo Lea was shown to have stronger binding activity to E-selectin than sialyl Lea(10Yuen C.-T. Bezouska K. O'Brien J. Stoll M. Lemoine R. Lubineau A. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Bockovich N.J.

Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase, which catalyzes transfer of sulfate from adenosine 3′-phosphate,5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to glycoprotein-bound carbohydrates, was reported in the thyroid (11Kato Y.

J. 1999; 16: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, differences have been noticed in substrate specificities of the Gal-3-O-sulfotransferases. The first Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase cloned was cerebroside sulfotransferase (16Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This enzyme cannot act on glycoprotein-bound glycans. Based on its sequence, a Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase acting on glycoprotein-bound glycans was cloned, and its properties were reported (17Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the enzymological studies mentioned above suggested that there might be other Gal-3-O-sulfotransferases with different specificities. Furthermore, it was not determined whether the initially cloned Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase acting on glycoprotein-bound glycans is involved in biosynthesis of 3′-sulfo LeX or 3′-sulfo Lea. Here, we describe molecular cloning of a new Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase with specificities different from the previously cloned enzymes, and we showed that the enzyme, in collaboration with fucosyltransferase III, can form 3′-sulfo LeX. [35S]PAPS (92.5 GBq/mmol) and GDP-[3H]fucose (640 GBq/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [α-32P]dCTP (110 GBq/nmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Galβ1–3GalNAc (core 1) was from Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Canada. Lacto-N-neotetraose, lacto-N-tetraose, LeX, Lea, and sialyllactosamine were from Dextra Laboratories, Reading, United Kingdom. Galactosylceramide, lactosylceramide, N-acetyllactosamine, and bovine kidney α-l-fucosidase were from Sigma. 3′-Sulfo LeXand human α 1,3-fucosyltransferase V were from Calbiochem. 3′-SulfoN-acetyllactosamine was prepared by digestion of 200 µg of 3′-sulfo LeX with 20 milliunits of α-l-fucosidase in 40 µl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 6 h and then isolated by Partisil-10 SAX (4.6 × 25 cm; Whatman) column chromatography (18Uchimura K.

A human expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (GenBankTM accession number AA417200) with a sequence similarity to the catalytic portion of human cerebroside sulfotransferase (16Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol.

Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). The EST clone was obtained from Kurabo Industries, Japan and was used as a template to amplify a part of the fragment for further hybridization studies. To obtain the fragment (nucleotide number 712–1014 in Fig.1 A), the sense primer 5′-AGCACCGTCTATGTCACCAT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GAAGTACTCGGCGATCATGA-3′ were designed and used for PCR amplification, which was performed by initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 58 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR product (302 base pairs) was subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and then the nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) and a 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The PCR product was 32P-labeled with MegaprimeTM DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe to screen the λgt 11 human fetal brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). Approximately 5 × 105plaques were screened. Hybridization was performed as described previously (23Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol.

The insert DNA in the positive λgt 11 clone was subcloned into the pBluescript II SK- (Stratagene) and then its nucleotide sequence was determined as described above. The full-length cDNA in pBluescript II was used as a template for PCR amplification of the open reading frame using the sense primer 5′-ACGAATTCTACTCCGCCATGCCACCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CTGAATTCAGCTCAGGGACCTTGAGGGC-3′. PCR was carried out as described above. The PCR product including the open reading frame of Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase (nucleotide number 274–1581 in Fig. 1 A) was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector and then the nucleotide sequence was confirmed as described above. The EcoRI fragment of the cloned human Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase was inserted into the same site of the pCXN2 expression vector (pCXN2 was constructed by Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki, Department of Disease-related Gene Regulation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo; see Ref. 24Niwa H.

CHO cells (3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish), precultured for 1 day, were transfected with 4 µg of relevant plasmid using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 60 h in culture in Ham's F-12 modified medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, the cells from three dishes were washed with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the dishes, and homogenized in 3 ml of 0.25 msucrose and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The homogenates were centrifuged briefly and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The precipitate as the microsomal fraction was dissolved in 70 µl of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol and used as the enzyme source. When oligosaccharides were used as substrates, the reaction mixture contained 2.5 µm of MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.5 µm MnCl2, 0.1 µm ATP, 4 µm NaF, 100 nm oligosaccharides, 200 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5 × 105 cpm), 0.05% Triton X-100, and 8 µl of microsomal fraction prepared from CHO cells in a final volume of 50 µl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tube in a boiling water bath for 1 min.35S-Labeled oligosaccharides were separated from inorganic sulfates and [35S]PAPS by Superdex 30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel chromatography or Partisil-10 SAX (4.6 × 25 cm; Whatman) column chromatography as described previously (18Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Kurosawa N. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. J. Biol.

Periodate oxidation was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 5 µl of35S-labeled products (5 × l03 cpm), 20 µl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4, containing 80 mm NaIO4. After incubation at 4 °C for 20 h in the dark, 5 µl of 20% ethylene glycol was added to reduce the remaining NaIO4. After standing for 1 h at room temperature, the samples were subjected to paper chromatography, which was performed in 1-butanol/acetic acid/1 mNH4OH (3:2:1 by volume). After chromatography the dried papers were cut into 1-cm pieces, and radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. A portion of each reaction mixture (3 µl) was also applied to a TLC plate, which was developed in ethanol/pyridine/n-butanol/water/acetic acid (100:10:10:30:3 by volume), and the radioactivity was visualized with a BAS 2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Smith degradation was performed as described previously with slight modifications (27Goldstein I.J. Hay G.W. Lewis B.A. Smith F. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 361-370Google Scholar). After periodate oxidation, which was carried out as described above, 5 mg of sodium borohydride were added to each reaction mixture, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 18 h. Then, HCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 N, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 8 h at room temperature. The reaction products were subjected to paper chromatography as described above. The reaction and the assay were carried out as described previously with slight modifications (28Kawano M. Honke K. Tachi M. Gasa S. Makita A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The assay mixture was composed of 25 mmsodium cacodylate, pH 6.4, 40 µm [35S]PAPS, 2 mm ATP, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 50 µm glycolipid substrates (GalCer and LacCer), 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, and 8 µl of the microsomal fraction in a final volume of 50 µl. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After termination of the reaction by addition of 1 ml of C-M-W solution (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O; 30:6:8 by volume), t. The whole reaction mixture was applied to a column of DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (acetate form) followed by washing with 2 ml each of C-M-W and methanol. Sulfated products were eluted with 7 ml of 90 mm ammonium acetate in methanol and assayed for radioactivity. COS-7 cells were transfected with the novel Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase cDNA or with fucosyltransferase III expression vector alone or co-transfected with both enzymes using LipofectAMINE reagent as described for CHO cells. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested and stained with the monoclonal antibody SU59 or F2 as described previously (29Mitsuoka C. Kawakami-Kimura N. Kasugai-Sawada M. Hiraiwa M. Toda K. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230 (; Correction (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.233, 576): 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Then, the cells were stained with 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and analyzed by FACS as described previously (29Mitsuoka C. Kawakami-Kimura N. Kasugai-Sawada M. Hiraiwa M. Toda K. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230 (; Correction (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed using 3′-sulfo LeX ceramide and 3′-sulfo Lea ceramide as described previously (21Mitsuoka C. Kasugai-Sawada M. Furui-Ando K. Izawa M. Nakanishi H.

A cDNA fragment, corresponding to nucleotide number 712–1014 in Fig. 1 A, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used to probe Northern blots (Multiple Tissue Northern blot; CLONTECH) of various human tissue mRNAs. Labeling of the probe and hybridization were performed as described previously (18Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Kurosawa N. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22577-22583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). By searching the EST data base, we found a small sequence (GenBankTM accession number AA417200) with similarity to the catalytic portion of the human cerebroside sulfotransferase cDNA (16Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The PCR product derived from this EST clone was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then used as a probe to screen a human fetal brain λgt 11 cDNA library. Three positive clones were obtained, one of which appeared to contain the full-length cDNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the clone revealed that it contained one open reading frame encoding a protein of 431 amino acids with a molecular mass of 48,955 Da and four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig.1 A). The sequence around the first ATG showed a good fit with Kozak's rule (30Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar), and the upstream region contained 2 stop codons. The protein encoded by the newly cloned cDNA showed 33% identity to human cerebroside sulfotransferase (16Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and 38% to the recently cloned human β-Gal3′-sulfotransferase (17Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Hydropathy plot analysis showed one prominent hydrophobic segment, which was comprised of 15 amino acid residues, near the amino-terminal region, suggesting that the protein has type II transmembrane topology. Similarly to other sulfotransferases, the sequence showed a highly conserved sequence forming the PAPS binding motif (Fig. 1 B) (31Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Through BLAST search a human genomic clone that contained a part of the Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase sequence (bac41i21; GenBankTM accession number AC008102) was found. Because this clone was derived from chromosome 11q13, we concluded that the human Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase gene is located in this position. The expression plasmid (pCXNGalST) was expressed in CHO cells, and the microsomal fraction of the transfected cells was assayed for sulfotransferase activity using 35S-labeled PAPS as the sulfate donor and Galβ1–4GlcNAc as the acceptor. Superdex 30 chromatography of the oligosaccharide reaction product revealed a radioactive peak, which was eluted slightly earlier than the acceptor (2–3 min) (Fig. 2 A), indicating that the acceptor was monosulfated (32Uchimura K. Fasakhany F. Kadomatsu K. Matsukawa T. Yamakawa T. Kurosawa N. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sulfotransferase activity in cells transfected with sense plasmid was 18-fold higher than that in control experiments in which the microsomal fractions were prepared from untransfected cells or from cells transfected with the empty vector (TableI). To determine the position at which the sulfate was transferred, the sulfated product derived from Galβ1–4GlcNAc was subjected to periodate oxidation. Upon Partisil-10 SAX column chromatography, the sulfated product was eluted at the position of 3′-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine (Fig.2 B). On paper chromatography (Fig. 2 C) and thin layer chromatography (data not shown), the sulfated products both before and after periodate oxidation migrated to the position of 3′-sulfo-N acetyllactosamine with similar recovery (Fig.2 C). Even after Smith degradation, in which the glycosidic linkage involving the oxidized sugar residue is cleaved, the radioactive product exhibited mobility and recovery indistinguishable from the untreated product (Fig. 2 D). This experiment rules out the possibility that the periodate actually affected the galactosyl residue, but the product co-migrated with 3′-sulfoN-acetyllactosamine. From the periodate resistance, sulfate was concluded to be transferred to the C-3 position of the Gal residue in Galβ1–4GlcNAc, because sulfation at C-2, C-4, or C-6 of the Gal residue or any position of GlcNAc would allow the product to be susceptible to periodate oxidation. Thus, the cloned enzyme is a novel Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase.Table IOverexpression of Gal-3-O-sulfotransferasePlasmidSulfotransferase activity1-aValues shown are averages ± S.D. of three microsomal preparations.pmol/h/mg proteinNone0.76 ± 0.05Mock1.12 ± 0.17Sense18.5 ± 2.7Sulfotransferase activities in the microsomal fractions of cells transfected with pCXNGalST (Sense) or pCXN2 vector only (Mock) or without plasmid (None) were determined using Galβ1–4GlcNAc as a sulfate acceptor.

The activity was calculated from the radioactivity contained in fraction numbers 92–96 by Superdex 30 chromatography (Fig. 2 A). To evaluate the substrate specificity of the cloned Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase, various oligosaccharides and glycolipids were used as acceptors (TableII). The cloned enzyme utilized Galβ1–4GlcNAc as the best acceptor and slightly less activity was found for lact-N-neotetraose. Much lower activity was observed when Galβ1–3GlcNAc and lacto-N-tetraose were used as acceptors. Therefore, the enzyme preferentially used type 2 structures as acceptors rather than type 1 structures. An intermediate level of activity was found to core 1 (Galβ1–3GalNAc) oligosaccharide. No sulfotransferase activity was detected toward glycolipids (GalCer, LacCer), LeX or Leaoligosaccharides, and/or Siaα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAc (Table II).Table IISubstrate specificities of newly cloned human Gal-3-O-sulfotransferaseAcceptorRelative activities of Gal-3-O sulfotransferase%2-aData represent one of two series of independent experiments, which exhibited essentially identical results.

SU59 monoclonal antibody recognized 3′-sulfo Lex efficiently and 3′-sulfo Lea to lesser extent (Fig. 3 I). To test whether 3′-sulfo Lea was formed in the doubly transfected cells, we also stained the cells with F2 monoclonal antibody, which reacts only to 3′-sulfo Lea and not to 3′-sulfo Lex (Fig.3 J; see Ref 33Veerman E.C.I. Bolscher J.G.M. Appelmelk B.J. Bloemena E. van den Berg T.K. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Only 3.5% of the co-transfected cells were reactive to this antibody (Fig. 3 H) indicating that the majority of the antigen formed was 3′-sulfo Lex, and only a small amount of 3′-sulfo Lea was formed. We then performedin vitro reaction to prove that the enzyme is involved in the synthesis of 3′-sulfo Lex. Because the enzyme did not act on Lex structure, the route of synthesis should be sulfation followed by fucosylation. Thus, the key issue is whether 3′-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine, the product of the enzymatic action, can be fucosylated by a fucosyltransferase. Because fucosyltransferase V, which utilizes N-acetyllactosamine and α(2,3)sialyllactosamine (34Weston B.W. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is commercially available, we incubated 3′-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine with the enzyme and GDP-[3H]fucose and then the reaction mixture was subjected to Superdex 30 column chromatography or Partisil-10 SAX column chromatography followed by counting the radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter. 3H-Labeled product eluted at the same position of 3′-sulfo Lex on both Superdex 30 column (data not shown) and Partisil-10 SAX column (Fig.4 B). These results indicated that the 3′-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine is fucosylated by fucosyltransferase V. Thus, we concluded that the present enzyme is involved in synthesis of 3′-sulfo Lex.Figure 43′-Sulfo N-acetyllactosamine was fucosylated by fucosyltransferase V in vitro.10 µg of 3′-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine was incubated with 5 milliunits of fucosyltransferase V in 30 µl of reaction mixture containing 30 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.8, 3 mm ATP, 20 mm MnCl2, 6 mm fucose, 0.4 µmGDP-[3H]fucose (about 5 × 104 cpm), and 30 µm GDP-fucose. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then the reaction was stopped by boiling for 2 min. Then, one-fifth of the reaction mixture was subjected to Partisil-10 SAX column chromatography. Radioactivity of each fraction was determined. All of radioactivity was eluted at void volume in control experiment in which the fucosyltransferase V was not added to the reaction mixture (A). 3H-Labeled product after the reaction was eluted at the elution position identical to that of 3′-sulfo Lex (B). Arrows indicate the elution positions of authentic standards as follows“1, 3′-sulfo Lex; 2, 3′-sulfoN-acetyllactosamine. Vo, void volume.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blotting analysis revealed that human Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase mRNA was about 3.2 kilobases in length. Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase was strongly expressed in the human thyroid, with moderate expression observed in the brain, kidney, heart, and spinal cord (Fig.5). Here, we reported the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding a novel human carbohydrate sulfotransferase. The specificity of the enzyme was clarified by periodate resistance of the product derived from Galβ1–4GlcNAc, and the enzyme was concluded to be a Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase. Formation of 3′-sulfo Lex by the enzyme in the presence of fucosyltransferase III supported this conclusion. This enzyme preferentially utilized substrates with type 2 structures rather than those with type 1 structures. In this respect, this enzyme was clearly different from Gal-3-O-sulfotransferases cloned previously (17Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which utilizes both type 1 and type 2 structures with similar efficiency. The two enzymes were also different with respect to organ distribution; the enzyme described here showed restricted distribution, whereas that reported previously exhibited ubiquitous expression (17Honke K.

We named enzyme characterized in the present study Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase 2 (GAL3ST2) based on these differences, as well as differences in protein structure and chromosomal localization. Gal-3-O-sulfotransferases with various substrate specificities have been reported to occur in many organs (11Kato Y. Spiro R.G. J. Biol.

The occurrence of multiple isozymes with different specificities and distributions has also been reported for other carbohydrate sulfotransferases such as GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases (18Uchimura K.

Future studies should focus on the biological significance of the occurrence of multiple molecular species of a carbohydrate sulfotransferase. The specificity of the present enzyme, GAL3ST2, agreed well with that of Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase in extracts from the thyroid (11Kato Y. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3364-3371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because GAL3ST2 was most strongly expressed in the thyroid, we believe that GAL3ST2 corresponded to Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase in this organ, which was the first Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase to be characterized (11Kato Y. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3364-3371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the thyroid, GAL3ST2 is expected to be involved in sulfation of glycans in thyroglobulin, which is known to have 3′-sulfated galactosyl residues (7Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14351-14358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GAL3ST2 has been shown to synthesize the 3′-sulfo Lexstructure in the presence of fucosyltransferase III. This is the first report of a sulfotransferase involved in synthesis of this antigen. Because of the inability of GAL3ST2 to act on Lexstructure, the route of synthesis was proposed to be sulfation followed by fucosylation. This point was proven by fucosylation of 3′-sulfoN-acetyllactosamine by fucosyltransferase V. In the case of formation of sialyl 6-sulfo Lex, a similar sequence of enzymatic reaction, i.e. sulfation, galactosylation, and then fucosylation, has been proposed previously (18Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Kurosawa N. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22577-22583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating fucosylation of a sulfated structure. Finally, GAL3ST2 might be utilized in synthesis of 3′-sulfo Lexoligosaccharides and possibly 3′-sulfo Leaoligosaccharides. The latter was shown to have stronger affinity to E-selectin than the corresponding 3′-sialyl oligosaccharides (10Yuen C.-T. Bezouska K. O'Brien J. Stoll M. Lemoine R. Lubineau A. Kiso M. Hasegawa A.

While this manuscript was under revision, Suzukiet al. (41Suzuki, A., Hiraoka, N., Suzuki, M., Angata, K., Misra, A. K., McAuliffe, J., Hindsgaul, O., and Fukuda, M. (April 25, 2001)J. Biol.

They showed that galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase-3 acts preferentially onN-acetyllactosamine in agreement with our observations.

https://openalex.org/W2077834631,"Phogrin, a 60/64-kDa integral membrane protein of dense-core granules in neuroendocrine cells, is phosphorylated in a Ca2+-sensitive manner in response to secretagogue stimulation of pancreatic β-cells. Phosphorylation of the phogrin cytosolic domain by β-cell homogenates was Ca2+-independent but stimulated by cAMP. Recombinant protein kinase A (PKA) could phosphorylate phogrin directly. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides, combined with site-directed mutagenesis of candidate sites, revealed the presence of two phosphorylation sites at Ser-680 and Thr-699, located in the juxtamembrane region between the transmembrane span and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase homology domain of phogrin. Full-length wild-type phogrin, as well as mutant versions where Ser-680 and Thr-699 had been replaced either by alanines or by aspartic acid residues, were targeted to secretory granules in transfected AtT20 neuroendocrine cells. Stimulation of these cells with a range of secretagogues, including K+, BaCl2, and forskolin, demonstrated that the in vivo phosphorylation sites are the same as those identified in vitro. In MIN6 β-cells, the PKA inhibitor H-89 prevented Ca2+-dependent phogrin phosphorylation in response to glucose, suggesting that Ca2+ exerts its effect on phogrin phosphorylation through regulating the activity of PKA. Phogrin, a 60/64-kDa integral membrane protein of dense-core granules in neuroendocrine cells, is phosphorylated in a Ca2+-sensitive manner in response to secretagogue stimulation of pancreatic β-cells. Phosphorylation of the phogrin cytosolic domain by β-cell homogenates was Ca2+-independent but stimulated by cAMP. Recombinant protein kinase A (PKA) could phosphorylate phogrin directly. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides, combined with site-directed mutagenesis of candidate sites, revealed the presence of two phosphorylation sites at Ser-680 and Thr-699, located in the juxtamembrane region between the transmembrane span and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase homology domain of phogrin. Full-length wild-type phogrin, as well as mutant versions where Ser-680 and Thr-699 had been replaced either by alanines or by aspartic acid residues, were targeted to secretory granules in transfected AtT20 neuroendocrine cells. Stimulation of these cells with a range of secretagogues, including K+, BaCl2, and forskolin, demonstrated that the in vivo phosphorylation sites are the same as those identified in vitro. In MIN6 β-cells, the PKA inhibitor H-89 prevented Ca2+-dependent phogrin phosphorylation in response to glucose, suggesting that Ca2+ exerts its effect on phogrin phosphorylation through regulating the activity of PKA.

However, unequivocal evidence for functional involvement of these enzymes in the secretory process is still lacking. Other second messengers, in particular cAMP, contribute to the regulation of exocytosis (9Howell S.L. Diabetologia. 1994; 37 Suppl. 2: S30-S35Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Gromada J.

Insulinotropic hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 or pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide increase intracellular cAMP levels by stimulating adenylyl cyclase through G-protein coupled receptors on the cell surface, an effect that can be mimicked by drugs like forskolin, which activate adenylyl cyclase directly. A rise in cAMP, and the subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA; cAMP-dependent kinase), is generally not sufficient in itself to evoke a secretory response in β-cells, but significantly potentiates glucose-induced insulin release. A number of mechanisms appear to be stimulated by cAMP (reviewed in Ref. 10Gromada J. Holst J.J. Rorsman P. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

Despite numerous studies implicating secretagogue-dependent activation of protein kinases in regulated secretion, the underlying molecular mechanisms and cellular targets of phosphorylation are poorly characterized. A large number of β-cell proteins are phosphorylated in a Ca2+- or cAMP-dependent manner in cell-free extracts (reviewed in Ref. 3Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Endocrine Rev. 1998; 19: 429-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but for the most part they have not been identified. In intact β-cells, the analysis of knownin vitro kinase substrates as candidate proteins has demonstrated stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin I (21Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J.

It is not clear, however, if these phosphorylation events play a direct role in mediating insulin release. Phogrin (phosphatase homologue ingranules of insulinoma) is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized to dense-core secretory granules in a wide range of neuronal and endocrine cell types (25Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26Pouli A.E. Emmanouilidou E. Zhao C. Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is a member of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, with a single cytosolic PTP domain, but appears to lack tyrosine phosphatase activity due to the substitution of a highly conserved residue within the substrate binding pocket. The protein is initially synthesized as a 135-kDa precursor and post-translationally processed in the secretory pathway to the mature 60/64-kDa form. We have recently shown that phogrin is phosphorylated in intact MIN6 β-cells upon secretagogue stimulation (27Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 563-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of phosphorylation parallels that of insulin release, and, like secretion, phosphorylation in response to glucose or high K+ is dependent on the presence of Ca2+. Conditions that increase cAMP levels stimulate phogrin phosphorylation in a Ca2+-independent manner. The modification of phogrin by two different intracellular signaling systems, both important in regulated exocytosis, combined with its strategic location on the dense-core granule surface, make it a good candidate for a protein with a key role in the regulation of secretory granule function. In this study, we report that phogrin is a substrate for PKA, and that phosphorylation occurs on a Ser and a Thr residue in its cytosolic domain. Our results indicate that Ca2+- and cAMP-mediated responses target the same phosphorylation sites, with the two signaling pathways converging upstream of PKA activation. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher, unless indicated otherwise. Molecular biology reagents were from New England Biolabs; cell culture supplies were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.; forskolin, IBMX, KN-93, and H-89 were from Calbiochem. MIN6 mouse insulinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, 25 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, antibiotics,l-glutamine, and 50 µm β-mercaptoethanol, as described previously (27Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 563-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AtT20 mouse anterior pituitary cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 (3:1 ratio) with 25 mm glucose, 10% donor calf serum with iron, 10% horse serum, and antibiotics. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the cytosolic domain of rat phogrin fused to GST (GST/C) (25Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. GST or GST/C (5 µm) was incubated at 30 °C with MIN6 extract (2 µg of protein) in 50 µl of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 µm ATP, 2 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Ca2+, or 10 µg/ml calmodulin as indicated in the figure legends. MIN6 extract was prepared by rinsing cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and homogenizing (several passes through a 28-gauge needle) in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA with protease inhibitors (10 µm pepstatin A, 10 µm E-64, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet extracted once in 0.25 volume of the above buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, re-centrifuged, and the supernatants combined. Cytosol fractionated by gel filtration (see below) was analyzed for phogrin phosphorylating activity in the same way, except that 25 µl of each column fraction was used/50-µl assay, resulting in a final concentration of 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm CaCl2 where present. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme preparation, and terminated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). Proteins were precipitated on ice for 60 min, pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and washed once in cold acetone before resuspension in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed in 50% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, in some cases in the presence of Coomassie Blue to stain proteins, and dried. Phosphate incorporation was visualized by phosphorimaging (Storm 860; Molecular Dynamics) and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). CaMKII activity was measured using the peptide substrate autocamtide-2. Peptide (25 µm) was incubated with MIN6 cytosol fractions (25 µl/50-µl assay) as described above for GST/C. Reactions were terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5% (w/v), incubated on ice for 20 min, and cleared of precipitated protein by centrifuging for 1 min at 12,000 × g. Aliquots of each supernatant were spotted onto P-81 paper (Whatman), immersed in cold 0.75% phosphoric acid, and rinsed three times in fresh solution. Incorporated radioactivity was detected by Cerenkov counting of filter papers in water. MIN6 cells were homogenized in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 200 mmsucrose, 50 mm NaCl with protease inhibitors, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant (“cytosol”) was subjected to gel filtration using a BioCAD 700E chromatography system (PerSeptive Biosystems). Sample (1.6 mg of protein in 0.4 ml) was fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (24 ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. GST or GST/C (5 µm) was incubated at 30 °C in 50 µl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 µm ATP, 2 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP with MIN6 protein in the presence or absence of 10 µm 8-Br-cAMP. MIN6 cells were either disrupted by sonication in PBS with protease inhibitors to obtain total protein (10 µg/assay) or fractionated by gel filtration (5 µl sample/assay). (Note: this resulted in a dilution of NaCl carried over from column fractions to 15 mm and avoided inhibition of PKA activity by high NaCl.) Alternatively, recombinant PKA catalytic subunit (0.1–10 units) (New England Biolabs) was used. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as detailed above. 100 µg of GST/C was phosphorylated with 5 units of PKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (8 µCi) in 100 µl of 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 µmATP for 2 h at 30 °C. Samples were heated to 100 °C for 15 min, cooled, and incubated with sequencing-grade trypsin (2 µg of trypsin:100 µg of GST/C) for 5 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by adding 5 µl of 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and insoluble material was removed by centrifuging for 5 min at 9,000 × g. For HPLC fractionation (BioCAD 700E), peptides were loaded onto a C18 reverse phase column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 10% (v/v) acetonitrile. Fractions of 1 ml, or 0.2 ml (in the peak 1 and 2 regions), were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using a linear gradient of 10–60% (v/v) acetonitrile for the first 60 ml, then 60–95% acetonitrile for 20 ml. Peptides were monitored by absorbance at 214 nm; 32P was measured by Cerenkov counting of fractions. Peptides of interest were sequenced by Edman degradation at the UCHSC Cancer Center core facility. Point mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Initially, phogrin cDNA fragments were amplified with a 5′ sense primer and a mutagenic antisense primer, or a corresponding sense mutagenic primer in combination with a 3′ antisense oligonucleotide. The following mutagenic primers were used (underlined nucleotides indicate base changes): S680A, 5′-CTGGGATGAGACAGCGTTGATGCGGG-3′ (antisense) and 5′-TCCCGCATCAACGCTGTCTCATCCCA-3′ (sense); S698A, 5′-ACCAGGATGAAGTGGCGCTCCGGGC-3′ (antisense) and 5′-TCAGCCCGGAGCGCCACTTCATCCTG-3′ (sense); T699A, 5′-TCAGACCAGGATGAAGCGCTGCTCCG-3′ (antisense) and 5′-CGGAGCAGCGCTTCATCCTGG-3′ (sense); S700A, 5′-TCCTCAGACCAGGATGCAGTGCTGCTC-3′ (antisense) and 5′-AGCAGCACTGCATCCTGGTCTG-3′ (sense); S680D, 5′-TGGGATGAGACATCGTTGATGCG-3′ (antisense) and 5′-TCCCGCATCAACGATGTCTCATC-3′ (sense); T699D, 5′-GACCAGGATGAATCGCTGCTCCG-3′ (antisense) and 5′-GCCCGGAGCAGCGATTCATCCTG-3′ (sense). PCR products were gel-purified (Qiaex II kit, Qiagen) and combined to serve as template for a second round of PCR using 5′ and 3′ flanking primers for amplification. The resulting products were cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning system (Invitrogen), then subcloned into pGEX-3X (Pharmacia) for the production of soluble cytosolic domain GST fusion proteins, or into full-length phogrin in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (25Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) for expression in mammalian cells. Primers 5′-CTACTAGATCTGCCACAACTCACACTACAAGCTGA-3′ and 5′-CTCCGAATTCGGTGCCTACTGGGGAAGGGCCTTC-3′ introducedBglII and EcoRI restriction sites for ligation into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-3X. Primers 5′-GAAAGGATCCCGAACTCAGAACCCCAACCCTGGA-3′ and 5′-TTCGGGTCGACCTGGGGAAGGGCCTTCAGGATG-3′ amplified an internalBstXI/BstEII fragment, which was inserted into phogrin in pGEM11Z (Promega), followed by transfer of the full-length sequence into pcDNA3 using the flanking EcoRI andXbaI sites. The presence of all point mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Phogrin constructs in pcDNA3 were transfected into AtT20 cells with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), following the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable neomycin-resistant cell lines were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 and screened for phogrin expression by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. For each construct, several phogrin-positive cell lines were initially characterized, and representative lines were chosen for subsequent experiments. Cells were maintained in medium containing 0.25 mg/ml G418. Cells were rinsed in PBS and scraped into PBS containing protease inhibitors for the determination of protein concentrations (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Alternatively, cells were lysed directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing dithiothreitol. Gel electrophoresis, semidry transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunodetection by enhanced chemifluorescence were performed as described previously (27Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 563-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phogrin was detected using an affinity-purified antibody raised to the lumenal domain of the protein (25Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Antisera to PKA (catalytic subunit) were from StressGen(anti-Cα; 1:2000), and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (anti-Cα/β; 1:500). Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine coated glass coverslips, rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. All blocking, labeling, and washing steps were carried out in PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Double-labeling was performed with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-phogrin (lumenal domain) (1:100) and mouse monoclonal anti-ACTH (1:10,000; from Dr. A. White, Manchester, United Kingdom) antisera, and visualized using Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:100) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:800) secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Images were acquired at 60× magnification using a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope equipped with a digital camera (Princeton Instruments) and SlideBook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). MIN6 cells were pre-equilibrated with [32P]Pi (175 µCi/35-mm well) for 2.5 h in modified Krebs buffer (5 mm KCl, 120 mmNaCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 24 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin) in a CO2/air incubator and stimulated with 10 µmforskolin in the same buffer. AtT20 cells were pre-equilibrated with [32P]Pi (175 µCi/35-mm well) for 2 h in phosphate-free DMEM/Krebs buffer (1:1) with 25 mmglucose (basal medium), followed by a 30-min incubation in either basal medium, medium adjusted to contain 55 mm KCl/68 mm NaCl, or medium containing 1 mmBaCl2, 10 µm forskolin, and 0.5 mm IBMX. After stimulation, cells were rinsed twice in PBS. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of phogrin were performed as described previously (27Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 563-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were pre-incubated for 2 h under basal conditions (modified Krebs buffer without glucose), then stimulated for 40 min with 16.7 mm glucose or 10 µm forskolin in the same buffer. Kinase inhibitors were added 30 min before the end of the pre-incubation period. Cells were harvested in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to electrophoresis on 7% gels to separate the 60- and 64-kDa forms of phogrin, and analyzed by Western blotting. We have previously shown that glucose-stimulated phogrin phosphorylation in intact β-cells is dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Inhibitor studies targeting different protein kinases were consistent with CaMKII activation being involved (27Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 563-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine this phosphorylation event further, the phogrin cytoplasmic domain fused to GST (GST/C) was incubated in vitro with MIN6 β-cell protein extract in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis on SDS-PAGE gels showed phosphate incorporation into the fusion protein (Fig. 1A). However, this was not stimulated by the addition of Ca2+and/or calmodulin and still occurred in the presence of a Ca2+ chelator (Fig. 1 B). Fractionation of MIN6 cytosol by gel filtration revealed that CaMKII activity eluted as a high molecular weight peak (Fig. 1 C, top panel), consistent with the existence of the enzyme in vivo as a multimeric complex of 8–12 subunits (6Easom R.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Ca2+/calmodulin also stimulated the incorporation of phosphate into several endogenous proteins in the same fractions (the bands of about 55 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels may represent autophosphorylated CaMKII monomers); however, no phosphorylation of phogrin was seen under these conditions (bottom panels). Similarly, phogrin was a poor substrate for recombinant CaMKII (data not shown). In vitro phosphorylation of phogrin GST/C by MIN6 extract was markedly stimulated by cAMP or its non-hydrolyzable analogue 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 2A). In MIN6 cytosol fractionated by gel filtration, cAMP-stimulated phosphorylating activity eluted in two broad peaks (Fig. 2 B, upper panels). Western blot analysis of PKA distribution with antibodies to the catalytic subunit of the kinase showed a similar profile, both for the α- and the β-isoforms (lower panels). The enzyme's presence in high molecular weight fractions may reflect the formation of a complex with regulatory subunits, and presumably interactions with anchoring proteins (28Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Incubation of GST/C with the recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA alone phosphorylated the fusion protein directly, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 C). Phosphorylation of mature phogrin in pancreatic β-cells induces a characteristic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE gels, giving rise to a 60-kDa basal form and a phosphorylated protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa. When in vitro phosphorylated GST/C was examined on SDS-PAGE gels, three distinct molecular forms were observed after Coomassie staining. Phosphorimaging revealed that two of these had incorporated phosphate (Fig. 2 D). Phosphorylated form 1 (P1) migrated with an apparent molecular mass of around 2 kDa higher than non-phosphorylated GST/C; P2 showed a shift of about 4 kDa. In a time-course experiment, P1 was observed initially, and the P2 form at later time points (data not shown), indicating the existence of more than one phosphorylation site. The cytosolic domain of phogrin contains 56 serine or threonine residues, 7 of these in classic PKA recognition motifs (29Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 265-291Google Scholar). To narrow down the location of the target sites, phogrin GST/C phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant PKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP was subjected to proteolytic digestion with trypsin and fractionated by HPLC. Two peaks of 32P incorporation were detected (peaks 1 and 2) (Fig. 3A), in both cases corresponding to well resolved peptide peaks monitored as absorbance at 214 nm (Fig. 3 B). Comparison of profiles for tryptic peptides derived from phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated GST/C demonstrated a shift of the two A 214 peaks toward elution at lower solvent concentrations upon incorporation of negatively charged phosphate groups into the peptides. N-terminal sequencing of peptide 1 yielded Ile-Asn-Ser-Val-Ser, identifying it as a 19-residue tryptic peptide spanning amino acids 678–696. For peptide 2, Ser-Ser-Thr-Ser-Ser was obtained, corresponding to a 32-residue peptide from amino acids 697 to 728 (Fig.3 C). Both peptides form part of a region highly enriched in serines that is located between the transmembrane span and the PTP homology domain of phogrin. The majority of PKA sites conform to the consensus targets Arg-X-(Ser/Thr) or Arg-X-X-Ser/Thr (29Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 265-291Google Scholar). Based on this, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on candidate residues within peptides 1 and 2. Mutants were expressed as cytosolic domain GST fusion proteins and tested for in vitrophosphorylation by recombinant PKA. Substitution of Ser-680 with alanine resulted in a significant decrease in phosphate incorporation, and in a reduced mobility shift on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.4A). Even after prolonged incubation times, S680A did not reach the P2 position of fully phosphorylated GST/C. Additional point mutations introduced at either Ser-698 or Ser-700 did not significantly alter the phosphorylation pattern. However, a S680A/T699A double mutant neither incorporated phosphate nor showed the corresponding bandshift (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that Ser-680 and Thr-699 were the PKA target sites in rat phogrin. AtT20 pituitary corticotroph tumor cells were chosen to examine the behavior of mutant forms of phogrin in a cellular context because these cells express very low levels of the endogenous molecule (Fig. 5, A(lane 1) and B (first panel)). Cells stably transfected with full-length wild-type phogrin analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the lumenal domain of the protein showed a doublet band at 60/64 kDa, the expected size for mature, post-translationally processed phogrin (Fig. 5 A). In addition, significant levels of the 135-kDa precursor and a 71/75-kDa doublet, presumably a processing intermediate, were seen. Immunofluorescence microscopy did not detect significant phogrin expression in the parental cell line or in cells transfected with vector alone. Cells transfected with wild-type phogrin showed strong labeling at the tips of cell extensions, as well as in the perinuclear region and in punctate structures throughout the cell body (Fig.5 B). The distribution of phogrin overlapped extensively with the labeling for the granule marker ACTH, both in the cell processes and in phogrin-positive cytoplasmic vesicles, suggesting that AtT20 cells, like pancreatic β-cells, targeted the recombinant molecule to secretory granules. When protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide for 2.5 h, the perinuclear pool largely disappeared while labeling of the tips was unaffected. A low level of cell surface staining was also seen for phogrin, and a small number of phogrin-positive, ACTH-negative vesicles were evident, especially in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with differences in trafficking between granule membrane components, which are retained and are thought to recycle after exocytosis, and content proteins, which are released. To evaluate the AtT20 cells' ability to phosphorylate phogrin in response to secretagogue stimulation, cells transfected with wild-type phogrin were pre-equilibrated with [32P]Pi, followed by incubation either in basal or in stimulation medium containing 10 µm forskolin and 0.5 mm IBMX. Immunoprecipitation of phogrin showed little background in cells transfected with vector alone. In phogrin-expressing cells, some32P labeling was observed under basal conditions, which was markedly increased in response to forskolin stimulation (Fig.5 C). Phosphate was incorporated both into the fully processed 60/64-kDa phogrin and the 71/75-kDa intermediate form. To study phogrin phosphorylatio"
https://openalex.org/W2071565757,"The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) has a vital role in cell growth and differentiation. To delineate further a mechanism for C/EBPα-mediated differentiation, we screened C/EBPα-interacting proteins through far-Western screening. One of the strongest interactions was with RFC140, the large subunit of the replication factor C complex. C/EBPα specifically interacted with RFC140 from rat liver nuclear extract as determined by a combination of affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation. Subsequent far-Western blotting showed that the bZIP domain of C/EBPα interacted with the DNA-binding region of RFC140. Overexpression of RFC140 in mammalian cells increased the transactivation activity of C/EBPα on both minimal and native promoters. Consistent with the enhanced transactivation, a complex of C/EBPα and RFC140 proteins with the cognate DNA element was detectedin vitro. The specific interaction between C/EBPα and RFC140 was detected in the terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes. The synergistic transcription effect of these two proteins increased the promoter activity and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, which is a main regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Our results demonstrate that the specific transcription factor C/EBPα and the general DNA replication factor RFC140 interact functionally and physically. This observation highlights a unique mechanism by which the levels of the general replication factor can strongly modulate the functional activity of the specific transcription factor as a coactivator."

When cells are cultured with a good nitrogen source (glutamine, ammonia), Gln3p and Gat1p are restricted to the cytoplasm, whereas with a poor nitrogen source (proline), they localize to the nucleus, bind to the GATA sequences of NCR-sensitive gene promoters, and activate transcription. The target of rapamycin-signaling cascade and Ure2p participate in regulating the cellular localization of Gln3p and Gat1p. Rapamycin, a Tor protein inhibitor, like growth with a poor nitrogen source, promotes nuclear localization of Gln3p and Gat1p. gln3Δ and ure2Δ mutants are partially resistant and hypersensitive to growth inhibition by rapamycin, respectively. We show that a vid30Δ is more rapamycin-sensitive than wild type but less so than a ure2Δ. VID30 expression is modestly NCR-sensitive, responsive to deletion of URE2, and greatly increases in low ammonia medium.

A significant contributor to the organism's success is its ability to selectively use a variety of nitrogen sources. The basis of this selectivity is nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR).1 Expression of nearly all genes whose products participate in the uptake and catabolism of nitrogenous compounds are NCR-sensitive and dependent upon two GATA family transcription factors, Gln3p and Gat1p/Nil1p (see Refs. 1Cooper T.G.

Gln3p, Gat1p, and Ure2p are hyperphosphorylated in cells provided with excess nitrogen and underphosphorylated when nitrogen is limiting or rapamycin is added to the medium (12Beck T. Hall M.N.

Together these data suggest that the Tor proteins play a role in transduction of the signal that responds to the cell's nitrogen supply. A search of the literature for rapamycin-related molecules identified a protein about which little is known, the product of the YGL227w open reading frame, which has been given the temporary designations Vid30p and Tin1p. 2J. M. Cherry, C. Ball, K. Dolinski, S. Dwight, M. Harris, J. C. Matese, G. Sherlock, G. Binkley, H. Jin, S. Weng, and D. Botstein, Saccharomyces Genome Data Base (genome-www.stanford.edu/ Saccharomyces/cgi-bin/SGD/locus.pl?locus=VID30). Since so little is known about this gene, we investigated its transcription profile and mutant phenotype. Here we show that VID30 expression possesses characteristics expected of an NCR-sensitive gene. Although avid30Δ mutant exhibits alterations in NCR-sensitive gene expression, the data we collected are most consistent with the suggestion that Vid30p function shifts nitrogen metabolism toward the formation of glutamate, especially when cells are grown in limiting ammonia. S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are all derivatives of wild type BY4742 (TableI). Yeast were cultured at 30 °C in YNB-glucose medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate or amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose; quantities of amino acids (in micrograms) were provided to cover auxotrophies where necessary). Proline (0.1%), ammonium sulfate (0.05 or 7.6 mm [0.1%]), or glutamine (0.1%) were provided as sole nitrogen sources. For all experiments, cells were harvested at a density of A 600 nm ∼0.8 and used for total RNA extraction.Table IStrains used in this researchStrainGenotypeS. cerevisiaeBY4742MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0BY14594MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 vid30ΔBY11983MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 ure2ΔBY10173MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 gln3ΔE. coliDH5αE. coli DH5α F′/endA1 hsdR17(r K− m K+)supE44 thi1 recA1 gyrA (Nalr) relA1Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169(m80lacZΔM15) Open table in a new tab The transcriptional effects of overexpressing VID30 were analyzed by growing transformants (pYES2 or pYES-V) of BY4742 in YNB-raffinose/galactose medium (1.5% raffinose + 0.5% galactose) with proline (0.1%) or glutamine (0.1%). Effects of VID30overexpression on cell growth were determined by growing wild type transformants (pYES2 or pYES-V) to exponential phase at 30 °C in YNB-glucose (2%)-ammonium sulfate (0.1%) medium. Cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in sterile water, and streaked onto YNB plates containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose and 0.1% proline, 0.1% glutamine, or 0.1% ammonium sulfate as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. To analyze the effects of rapamycin, vid30Δ,ure2Δ, gln3Δ, and wild type strains growing exponentially in YPD medium were harvested, washed, resuspended in sterile water, and streaked onto YPD or YPD + 50 ng/ml rapamycin solid media. The plates were incubated at 30 °C, 3 days for YPD and 5 days for YPD + rapamycin. Total RNA was isolated as described previously (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

Double-stranded DNA probes (radioactively labeled using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit [Roche Molecular Biochemicals]) were synthesized by PCR using the oligonucleotides in Table II as primers. pC4 (loading and transfer standard) and pTSC317 (DAL80) were also used as probes (32Law D.T.S.

Open table in a new tab Overexpression of VID30 was achieved by fusing it to the GAL1 promoter in multicopy pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). VID30 was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using heat-stable DNA polymerase PWO, and primers VKpn-5 and VXho-3 (Table II), into which KpnI and XhoI sites had been engineered, respectively. The resulting PCR product was digested withKpnI and XhoI, yielding a 3,028 base pair fragment, which was cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pYES2 to create pYES-V. To ascertain whether Vid30p played a part in the rapamycin cascade that participates in the regulation of NCR-sensitive gene expression, we compared the effects of the TOR protein inhibitor, rapamycin, on wild type and mutant cells. Growth of ure2Δ strains are hypersensitive to rapamycin, while gln3Δ mutants are more resistant than wild type (13Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C. Di Como C.J. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 17Bertram P. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.-F. Zheng X.F.Z. J. Biol.

A vid30Δ mutant is slightly less hypersensitive than a ure2Δ strain (Fig.1), implying a relationship potentially exits between the TOR signaling cascade and Vid30p function. This prompted us to determine whether VID30 expression was NCR-sensitive by assaying steady-state VID30 mRNA derived from cells cultured in YNB-proline (nitrogen-derepressive) and YNB-glutamine (nitrogen-repressive) media. VID30 expression is modestly NCR-sensitive (Fig.2 A); this result can be even more clearly observed when the autoradiogram is highly overexposed. The NCR sensitivity of VID30 expression and rapamycin sensitivity of a vid30Δ mutant predicted a response ofVID30 expression to deletion of URE2 or addition of rapamycin to the medium. In agreement with these expectations,VID30 expression increases following addition of 200 ng/ml rapamycin to nitrogen-rich medium, but less dramatically so than occurs with the control gene, DAL5 (Fig. 2 B).VID30 expression in cells provided with high ammonia or glutamine (excess nitrogen) also increases when URE2 is deleted (Fig. 2 C). It is significant that the magnitude of NCR sensitivity, rapamycin-mediated induction, andure2Δ-generated derepression of VID30expression are quantitatively similar. Together, these data argue thatVID30 expression is modestly NCR-sensitive.Figure 2VID30expression is NCR-sensitive and induced by the TOR protein inhibitor rapamycin.

Included in the analysis were genes encoding (i) permeases: MEP2 (low capacity ammonia),DAL4 (allantoin), DAL5 (allantoate), andCAN1 (basic amino acid); (ii) enzymes for the interconversion of ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine: GDH1(NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase), GDH3 (NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase), GDH2 (NAD-glutamate dehydrogenase),GLN1 (glutamine synthetase), and GLT1 (glutamate synthase (GOGAT, glutamine amide: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase)); (iii) an enzyme participating in catabolism of allantoin:DAL1 (allantoinase); and (iv) the GATA-specific transcriptional repressor: DAL80. Deletion of VID30 increases CAN1,DAL4, DAL5, MEP2, DAL1,GDH3, and DAL80 mRNA levels 2–10-fold in YNB-proline-cultured cells (Fig.3 A). However, the NCR sensitivity of these genes is not affected, i.e. there is no alteration of expression when a vid30Δ mutant is growing in glucose-glutamine medium (Fig. 3 A). At this point, we cannot rigorously distinguish whether the effects observed when avid30Δ mutant is grown in glucose-proline medium are direct or indirect. In contrast to typical NCR-sensitive genes, the expression profiles of genes associated with the interconversion of ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine (GDH1, GDH2, GLN1, andGLT1) are quite different in two respects (Fig.3 B): (i) these genes are expressed more or less equivalently when wild type and vid30Δ strains are grown in YNB-proline medium, and (ii) their expression is markedly increased when avid30Δ mutant growing in YNB-glutamine medium is compared with wild type; we estimate the increase to be in the range of 2–10-fold (Fig. 3 B). These results argue that Vid30p negatively regulates CAN1, DAL4, DAL5,MEP2, DAL1, GDH3, and DAL80when cells are growing with proline as the nitrogen source andGDH1, GDH2, GLN1, and GLT1when cells are provided with glutamine. However, deletion ofVID30 does not restore expression of the second group of genes in glucose-glutamine grown cells to the level seen in the glucose-proline medium. They are more highly expressed in proline medium regardless of whether or not Vid30p is present (Fig.3 B), indicating that negative regulation by Vid30p is shared, in a formal sense, by at least one other protein. AlthoughVID30 expression is modestly NCR-sensitive, more striking is the dramatic increase in VID30 expression that occurs when cells are grown in medium containing low ammonia (0.05 mm) (Fig. 4 A). VID30expression in low ammonia medium is more than 10-fold greater than with proline as nitrogen source (Fig. 4 A). This high level ofVID30 expression is lost within 15 min after the ammonia concentration in the culture medium is increased to 0.1% (Fig.4 B). The VID30 expression we observe in low ammonia medium may conceivably be derived in two ways: (i) a response of VID30expression to the low concentration of ammonia or (ii) nitrogen starvation per se. To distinguish these possibilities, we divided a culture into two portions, one being transferred to low ammonia and the other a similarly low concentration of proline. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the response was observed only in low ammonia medium, arguing against starvation as the driving force behind increased VID30 expression. High levelVID30 expression in low ammonia (0.05 mm) medium, and its loss when ammonia concentrations are high (7.6 mm (0.1%)), prompted us to investigate Vid30p regulation of other nitrogen metabolism-related genes under similar experimental conditions. We analyzed expression of the two groups of genes described in Fig. 3 in wild type and vid30Δ strains. ForCAN1, DAL4, DAL5, MEP2, andDAL1, the fold increase observed when comparing expression in low versus high ammonia-grown cells, is smaller in thevid30Δ mutant than the wild type (Fig.5 A). This result derives from the fact that deletion of VID30 decreases expression of these genes in low ammonia medium with no demonstrable effect in high ammonia medium. These results suggest that Vid30p acts as a positive regulator of CAN1, DAL4, DAL5,MEP2, and DAL1 gene expression in low ammonia. Taken together, these data and those in Fig. 3 suggest that Vid30p functions as a negative regulator with proline as the nitrogen source and as a positive regulator with low ammonia. With exception of GDH2, deletion of VID30 does not effect the expression of ammonia-glutamate-glutamine interconversion genes when cells are growing in high ammonia medium (Fig. 5 B). The steady-state level of GDH2mRNA modestly increases in the vid30Δ. In addition, there is no detectable expression of GDH3, which is not surprising given its high NCR sensitivity and the fact that high ammonia is a repressive nitrogen source. On the other hand, in low ammonia medium, there is less expression of the GDH1,GDH3, and GLT1 genes in vid30Δ than wild type. GDH2 and maybe GLN1 are the exceptions, i.e. their expression increases rather than decreases when the vid30Δ mutant is grown in low ammonia (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, Vid30p behaves as a positive regulator for all of the interconversion genes in low ammonia-grown cells with the exception of GDH2 and GLN1, where control is modestly negative. The NCR-sensitive, rapamycin-responsive expression of VID30 prompted us to examine the effect of VID30 overexpression on cell growth in different nitrogen conditions. VID30 was fused to theGAL1 promoter in pYES2, allowing VID30 expression to be induced independently of the nitrogen source in the medium. Wild type strain BY4742, transformed with vector pYES2, grows similarly on YNB-glucose or YNB-galactose medium containing 0.1% ammonium sulfate or glutamine as the sole nitrogen source (Fig.6). The transformants grow more slowly, however, on YNB-galactose-proline medium. Cells transformed withGAL1-VID30 pYES-V grow like the control cells on YNB-glucose, irrespective of the nitrogen source supplied. However, growth on all three nitrogen sources is inhibited when VID30is overexpressed (galactose as a carbon source) (Fig. 6). These results indicate that controlled expression of VID30 is essential for optimal cell growth. Next, we examined the effect of VID30 overexpression (Fig.7, top panels) on the transcription of nitrogen-associated genes in cells provided with different nitrogen sources. If anything, Vid30p exhibits characteristics of a very modest negative regulator of NCR-sensitive gene expression in cells growing with proline as nitrogen source (Fig.7 A). There is somewhat more expression of CAN1, DAL4, DAL5, and MEP2 observed in the wild type strain transformed with pYES2 than with pYES-V; DAL4 expression is clearly most responsive. Two genes, DAL1 andDAL80, did not respond to VID30 overexpression (Fig. 7 A). Overexpression of VID30 did not detectably alter expression of any of these genes in cells grown under repressive conditions (with glutamine as the nitrogen source) (Fig.7 A). These results support the suggestions that: (i) Vid30p negatively regulates NCR-sensitive gene expression in cells grown with proline as nitrogen source, and (ii) Vid30p has no effect on the transcription of these genes in cells grown under repressive nitrogen conditions. These conclusions are consistent with those derived from the data in Fig. 3 A, where, by deletion, Vid30p was shown to be a negative regulator of CAN1, DAL4, DAL5, MEP2, DAL1, GDH3, and DAL80 gene expression in proline-grown cells. The expression profiles of the ammonia-glutamate-glutamine interconversion genes were more complex. In YNB-proline-grown cells,GDH1 expression slightly decreases, while the decrease inGLT1 expression is dramatic; GLN1 expression slightly increases (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, GDH2expression increases rather markedly in proline grown cells overexpressing VID30 (Fig. 7 B). Expression ofGDH1 modestly increases, that of GDH2 decreases slightly, and that of GLN1 and GLT1 is not affected by VID30 overexpression with glutamine as the nitrogen source (Fig. 7 B). Data presented in this work demonstrate that Vid30p is a participant in the complex regulatory network controlling nitrogen metabolism in S. cerevisiae. VID30 is among the genes whose expression is NCR-sensitive, regulated by Ure2p, and induced by rapamycin. The strength of regulation, however, is only modest to moderate when compared with that of DAL5 or DAL80under similar circumstances. The more dramatic regulation ofVID30 expression occurs in response to ammonia. In low ammonia medium, VID30 expression is remarkably high and rapidly decreases when the ammonia concentration in the medium is increased (Fig. 8). That VID30expression is enhanced in response to low ammonia rather than starvation is supported by the observation that it does not occur in similarly low concentrations of proline. The effects of Vid30p on the expression of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism are quite complex. With proline as the nitrogen source, Vid30p negatively regulates the nitrogen catabolic genes,CAN1, DAL4, DAL5, MEP2,DAL1, DAL80, and GDH3, but does not affect expression of GDH1, GLN1, orGLT1. There is a small positive effect on GDH2. With glutamine as the nitrogen source, the direction and strength of regulation is reversed. There is little if any effect of Vid30p on the regulation of CAN1, DAL4, DAL5,MEP2, DAL1, DAL80, andGDH3. In contrast, Vid30p is a significant negative regulator of GDH1, GDH2, GLN1, andGLT1 expression. The most obvious difference between these two sets of genes is that the latter are associated with the interconversion of ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine. Similar partitioning of these nitrogen metabolic genes is observed when the influence of Vid30p on their expression profiles was assayed in high and low ammonia. Since high ammonia is a strongly repressive condition, little if any expression was observed for CAN1,DAL4, DAL5, MEP2, DAL1,DAL80, and GDH3, and the presence or absence of Vid30p does not affect it. GDH1, GLN1, andGLT1 were expressed in high ammonia, but again Vid30p did not affect their expression. Only for GDH2 does Vid30p behave as a negative regulator. On low ammonia, Vid30p is a positive regulator of all genes except GLN1 and GDH2, where it behaves as a negative regulator. Data obtained with cells overexpressing VID30 are consistent with the patterns of regulation just summarized. From these data, we conclude that Vid30p function most significantly influences the control of ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine interconversion (Fig. 8), functioning to keep metabolism directed toward glutamate formation, especially when limiting ammonia is provided to the cells. The following reasoning supports this suggestion. The GDH1, GDH2, GLN1, andGLT1 gene products can be functionally divided into two groups: (i) enzymes that, respectively, catalyze conversion of ammonia and glutamine to glutamate, GDH1, GDH3, andGLT1 and (ii) those that, respectively, catalyze conversion of glutamate to ammonia and glutamine, GDH2 and GLN1. GDH1, GDH3, and GLT1 expression decreases markedly when a vid30Δ is grown in low ammonia, whereas GDH2and GLN1 expression modestly increases. In other words, Vid30p modestly represses expression of genes whose products decrease the glutamate pool (GDH2, GLN1) and markedly activates expression of those whose products increase it (GDH1, GDH3, GLT1). These responses shift the interconversion reactions toward production of glutamate and away from ammonia and glutamine. When cells are grown with high ammonia, VID30 expression itself is strongly decreased, thereby decreasing its ability to serve as a regulator. Therefore, it is not too surprising that about the only thing Vid30p does in high ammonia is to repress expression ofGDH2, whose product decreases the glutamate pool. The NCR-sensitive GDH3 gene is not expressed under these conditions. In high ammonia, as in low, Vid30p function appears to be shifting the balance of metabolism toward glutamate. GLT1,GLN1, and GDH1 expression is not demonstrably affected in high ammonia, while GDH2 and GLN1 do not greatly respond to a vid30Δ with low ammonia. This seeming contradiction, however, is more apparent than real. Recall thatGLT1 and GLN1 can function in concert to form glutamate from ammonia. In this regard, it is pertinent to mention that the K m for glutamine of the S. cerevisiaeGOGAT (encoded by GLT1) is reported to be 0.29 mm (34Cogoni C. Valenzuela L. Gonzalez-Halphen D. Olivera H. Macino G. Ballario P. Gonzalez A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 792-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such high concentrations of glutamine are much more easily achieved in high rather than low ammonia medium. By this reasoning, GOGAT functions along with the GDH1 product to produce glutamate when environmental ammonia is high and whenGDH3, whose product is responsible for one of the three routes to glutamate production, is largely not expressed due to its NCR sensitivity. If this suggestion is correct, GOGAT may be able to function quite differently in yeast than in bacteria where it, in collaboration with glutamine synthetase, is reported to be the primary route of ammonia assimilation (30Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 301-320Google Scholar). In summation, when ammonia is the nitrogen source, Vid30p function shifts nitrogen metabolism toward glutamate production in the face of many biosynthetic reactions that use glutamate to produce nitrogenous macromolecules. The end products of nitrogen catabolic pathways associated with most poor nitrogen sources such as proline or allantoin are glutamate or ammonia, respectively, produced at a growth-limiting rate. Consistent with these physiological conditions, Vid30p function exhibits characteristics of a negative regulator for the expression of typical NCR-sensitive genes whose expression we measured when cells are provided with proline as the sole nitrogen source. It also is not particularly surprising that the ammonia-glutamate-glutamine interconversion genes are not highly regulated in proline medium, because the cell's glutamate requirement will be fulfilled more readily than either that for glutamine or ammonia. This derives from the fact that glutamate is the primary end product of proline catabolism. The situation is quite different when the nitrogen source is glutamine. In this case, the need for ammonia is much smaller, and its supply is much greater. Furthermore, there is a good supply of glutamine and glutamate as well. Therefore, Vid30p function partially represses expression of all of the interconversion genes withGLT1 being the least down-regulated when glutamine is provided as the sole nitrogen source. Vid30p function doesn't appear to repress GDH3 expression, but in this instance, Vid30p-mediated repression is not necessary, because GDH3expression is already highly repressed due to its NCR sensitivity. Although the data provide new insights into the nature of potential Vid30p functions, the mechanistic details of how these functions are accomplished remain to be elucidated, as do the identities of direct Vid30p targets.

In this study we investigated the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the expression of c-<i>fos</i> and its product, c-Fos, in human epithelial cell line MKN74. The expression level of c-Fos protein in HGF/SF-stimulated cells was 5–10-fold higher than that in EGF-stimulated cells, whereas the level of c-<i>fos</i> mRNA induced by HGF/SF was similar to that by EGF. The hyperphosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), indicative of an increased number of translation initiation complexes, was detected only in HGF/SF-induced MKN74 cells. Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH kinase and FKBP12-rapamycin associated mammalian target of rapamycin (FRAP/mTOR) was observed after the treatment with HGF/SF. Pretreatment with an inhibitor of either one, <i>i.e.</i> LY294002 for phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH kinase or rapamycin for FRAP/mTOR, completely inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and decreased the c-Fos synthesis induced by HGF/SF down to the level found in EGF-induced cells. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is stimulated by HGF/SF in a manner requiring both phosphatidy-linositol-3′-OH kinase-dependent and FRAP/mTOR-dependent pathways, thereby stimulating c-<i>fos</i> mRNA translation. Regulation of the translation process of c-<i>fos</i> mRNA in addition to the immediate activation of c-<i>fos</i> transcription is necessary for the transient increase in the level of c-Fos protein to stimulate cell proliferation."

In the case of themal isolate of HIV-1, intermolecular pairing between the U-rich tRNA anticodon loop and the A-rich U5-IR loop upstream of the PBS has been demonstrated to play an important role in this transition (15Isel C.

Collectively, these findings show that additional base pairing with the viral U5-IR stem-loop can occur at positions throughout the entire tRNA replication primer. Although feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RT shares a heterodimeric organization of its p66 and p51 subunits with the HIV-1 enzyme and likewise exploits tRNALys,3 as its replication primer, the absence of an A-rich U5-IR loop upstream of the PBS suggests base pairing with the tRNA anticodon loop is unlikely. Significant differences between the HIV and FIV initiation complexes is also predicted by our observations that the p66/p66 and p66/p51 forms of FIV RT fail to productively extend tRNALys,3 hybridized to the PBS of the HIV-1 genome while catalyzing the equivalent event on the FIV genome (34Arts E.J. Stetor S.R. Li X. Rausch J.W. Howard K.J. Ehresmann B. North T.W. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Wainberg M.A. Le Grice S.F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10063-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, we have noted significant pausing and arrest of DNA synthesis following polymerization of ∼14 nucleotides of FIV (−)-strand strong-stop DNA (34Arts E.J. Stetor S.R. Li X. Rausch J.W. Howard K.J. Ehresmann B. North T.W. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Wainberg M.A. Le Grice S.F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10063-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This feature was observed with both HIV-1 and FIV RT suggesting it was mediated by a structural feature of the tRNA-viral RNA duplex rather than a deficiency in the retroviral polymerase. Further inspection of FIV U5-IR loop sequences indicated extensive homology with nucleotides at the extreme 5′-end of tRNALys,3. Although these tRNA nucleotides would make up in part the acceptor stem in free tRNALys,3, they might be available for pairing upon its hybridization to the FIV PBS, an event mediated through the 18 3′ terminal tRNA nucleotides. If correct, this scenario would contrast sharply with the situation in HIV-1, where both chemical and enzymatic mapping indicate that hybridization of tRNALys,3 to PBS-containing RNA is accompanied by extensive rearrangement and intramolecular pairing of its 5′ terminus with nucleotides of the TΨC arm (16Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present article, we have evaluated the initiation program of FIV by a variety of approaches, directed at both the tRNA primer and viral RNA genome. The first of these involved nuclease mapping of the 5′ end of the FIV genome to which full-length tRNALys,3 and a variant lacking nucleotides constituting part of the D stem-loop and the entire 5′ acceptor stem terminus was hybridized. This approach provides preliminary information on the availability of the FIV U5-IR loop for an interaction with the tRNA 5′ terminus. Subsequently, we employed tRNA variants containing increasing lengths of (−)-DNA at their 3′ terminus to determine the stage in (−)-strand synthesis at which arrest at position +14 is overcome. Finally, variants of the FIV genome containing a modified U5-IR loop were constructed to determine whether (a) relief of the proposed base pairing is achieved by introducing an unrelated sequence and (b) introduction of an A-rich U5-IR loop induced an initiation program similar to that reported for HIV-1, i.e. extensive pausing between template positions +3 and +5. Data presented herein supports the notion that FIV exploits a novel intermolecular base pairing interaction to control initiation that is independent of hypermodified bases of the tRNA primer. Moreover, when the FIV genome is mutated to introduce an A-rich U5-IR loop, this does not induce an HIV-like initiation program, but rather allows high level DNA synthesis with minimal pausing. Initiation of reverse transcription in many retroviruses and retrotransposons can thus be viewed as a complex, multistep process where productive elongation arises through “escape” synthesis from an abortive initiation complex, in many respects analogous to the initiation program exhibited by prokaryotic RNA polymerase. Restriction enzymes, DNA/RNA modifying enzymes, dNTPs, rNTPs, and glycogen were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 32P-Labeled nucleotides were the products ofAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. T7 RNA polymerase was acquired fromPromega, Madison, WI. RNase T1 and nuclease S1 were from Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA. All other reagents were of the highest purity and purchased from Fisher, Sigma, and Bio-Rad. p34TF10, a plasmid containing the full FIV Petaluma genome, was a gift from Dr. T.

For expression of the FIV RT p66 subunit, pFIV RT was created by ligation of an insert generated by PCR and cleaved with BglII/SalI into plasmid pRT (36Le Grice S.F.J. Gruninger-Leitch F. Eur. J.

For expression of the FIV RT His6-p51 subunit, p6H FIV RT51 was created by ligation of an insert generated by PCR and cleaved with BglII/HindIII into plasmid p6H RT51 (36Le Grice S.F.J.

After expression, each subunit represents the authentic sequence with the exception of a Met-Arg-Gly sequence substituted for the amino-terminal isoleucine, and an additional 6 histidine residues at the NH2 terminus of p51. Each clone was verified by sequencing. Recombinant p66/p51 FIV RT was prepared byin vitro reconstitution from strains M15::pDMI.1::pFIVRT (p66) and M15::pDMI.1::p6HFIVRT51 (His-p51) following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Enzyme was purified by a combination of metal chelate and ion exchange chromatography (38Le Grice S.F.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and exhibited a 1:1 stoichiometry between subunits when examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Wild type and mutant viral RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription utilizing a T7 promoter-containing PCR product. Viral RNA templates were produced in two sizes, namely a 416-nt sequence beginning at the start of the R region and a 123-nt species initiating at the start of the U5 region. Primer extension reactions comparing products in these assays with either the short 123-nt or long 416-nt template were indistinguishable. 5′-32P-Labeled templates were prepared by phosphorylation of RNA lacking a 5′ phosphate (see below) utilizing T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) following standard protocols. RNA templates with a 5′-terminal guanosine residue were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and a 5-fold excess of guanosine included over the other 4 rNTPs. Synthetic tRNALys,3 was prepared by in vitro transcription utilizing a T7 promoter-containing PCR product, with the addition of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) if the primer was to be internally labeled. Synthetic tRNA lacking 17 nucleotides at the 5′-end was prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase of FokI cleaved pLYSF119 containing the gene for 3′-59-mer tRNALys,3 (39Stello T.

Natural (fully modified) tRNALys,3 was prepared from bovine liver as described previously (40Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol.

Natural tRNALys,3 was annealed to a PBS-containing DNA oligonucleotide (flanked 5′ and 3′ by 7 and 10 nt of FIV sequence, respectively) and extended by one deoxyadenosine residue with the large fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase as described (34Arts E.J.

This primer was purified by high voltage denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis and annealed to the template as detailed below. Extended tRNA/DNA chimeras were also prepared by this method, with the following modifications:32P-internally labeled synthetic tRNALys,3 was annealed to one of three different PBS-containing DNA oligonucleotides, each flanked 3′ by 10 nt, and at the 5′-end extending 7, 11, and 32 nt 5′ to the PBS, respectively. The species extended by 7, 11, and 32 deoxynucleotides were created by adding all four dNTPs to the primer extension reaction and allowing run-off synthesis. To create the species extended by three deoxynucleotides, a mixture of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP was used. Annealing was facilitated by mixing a 2-fold molar excess of template with primer in 100 mm NaCl and heating to 90 °C for 2 min. This denaturation step was quenched on ice for 2 min, after which the reaction was incubated at 70 °C for 20 min, and stored on ice. The efficiency of annealing was verified by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and was always 90–100%. Annealed template/primer was added at a final concentration of 40 nm to a reaction buffer containing 42.9 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme was added to a final concentration of 80 nm and complex formation was allowed to proceed for 1 min at 37 °C. dNTPs were added to a final concentration of 200 µm and aliquots were taken between 10 s and 10 min, extracted with an equal volume of phenol/CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and precipitated with glycogen (final 0.4 mg/ml), sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and ethanol.

Enzyme was added to a final concentration of 80 nm and complex formation was allowed to proceed for 1 min at 37 °C. A mixture of heparin and dNTPs were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and 200 µm, respectively. Aliquots were taken between 10 s and 10 min, extracted with an equal volume of phenol/CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with glycogen (final 0.4 mg/ml), sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and ethanol.

Dried gels were evaluated as above. As a control for trap efficiency, RT and heparin were preincubated with buffer; the reaction was initiated with template/primer and dNTPs and allowed to proceed 10 min. The annealing reaction was composed of 5′-32P-labeled template RNA, 75 ng/µl, specific activity ∼500 cpm/ng, combined with (when appropriate) a 2-fold molar excess of primer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl. This mixture was heated to 90 °C for 2 min. The sample was quenched on ice for 2 min, after which the reaction was incubated at 70 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm and the reaction incubated at room temperature for 15 min. All cleavage reactions were performed in a rack previously cooled to 4 °C and placed on ice prior to assembly of the reaction. S1 nuclease cleavage was performed in a buffer of 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnCl2, 5% glycerol, 25 ng/µl yeast tRNA, 7.5 ng/µl template/primer, and 0.7 units/µl nuclease S1. Prior to addition of enzyme, samples were incubated in the cooled rack for 2 min to ensure uniform temperature. Cleavage was initiated by addition of S1 nuclease, freshly diluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol, aliquots were removed at 1, 5, and 10 min, immediately extracted with an equal volume of phenol/CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with 0.4 mg/ml glycogen, sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and ethanol. RNase T1 cleavage was performed in a buffer of 35 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 ng/µl yeast tRNA, 7.5 ng/µl template/primer, and 0.12 unit/µl RNase T1.

After precipitation, the pellets were washed with 70% EtOH, dried, resuspended in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA, 7m urea, 0.1% xylene cyanole, 0.1% bromphenol blue and subjected to high voltage denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig.1 A provides a time course of (−)-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis catalyzed by heterodimeric (p66/p51) FIV RT on its wild type genome containing a radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide hybridized to the PBS. In the immediate vicinity of the initiation site, pausing occurs early in the time course, although the products gradually diminish as they are replaced by the full-length (−)-strand strong-stop DNA. A similar DNA synthesis profile was obtained with an oligoribonucleotide hybridized to the PBS (data not shown). In contrast, the pausing profile was significantly altered when the oligonucleotide primers were replaced with the 76-nt natural tRNALys,3 (Fig. 1 B). Two pause sites limited the amount of full-length cDNA formed. The first of these occurs at position T + 7 (designating T as the length of the tRNA primer), and rapidly diminishes with extended incubation. Given the length of the nascent DNA, the T + 7 product is unlikely to correspond to the early initiation products observed with HIV-1 RT on its homologous RNA genome. Rather, we believe this corresponds to the gradual replacement of duplex RNA in the nucleic acid-binding cleft with an RNA-DNA hybrid and the transition of this junction over the p66 thumb subdomain as was recently demonstrated for HIV (17Lanchy J.M.

However, a T + 14 product accumulates throughout the time course, suggesting a feature of the tRNA-viral RNA complex was transiently halting the FIV replication machinery. In order to determine if the enzyme stalled at these pause sites remains bound or dissociates, primer extension was evaluated in the presence of a heparin trap (Fig. 1 C), which restricts the enzyme to a single binding event. RT was pre-bound to the template/primer and the reaction initiated with dNTPs and heparin. As early as 10 s, T + 7 and T + 14 extended primers accumulated. This pattern remained essentially unchanged with prolonged incubation, with 64% termination at T + 7. Of the remaining 36% that reached T + 14, 85% termination efficiency was observed, and only 0.25% of those proceeding through both pause sites reached full-length (−)-strand strong-stop. These data indicate that the majority of the enzyme dissociates during the transition from RNA/DNA to RNA/RNA in the nucleic acid-binding cleft. In addition, those that remain associated are likely to encounter a second barrier and dissociate at T + 14. Unextended tRNA primer remains at late time points, even though the reaction is performed in 2-fold enzyme excess. This is likely caused by the fact that the enzyme preparation itself may only be partially active. Previous studies of HIV-1 or EIAV RT isolated in an analogous fashion report values of ∼50% active enzyme in those preparations (42Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol.

Li X. Rausch J.W. Howard K.J. Ehresmann B. North T.W. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Wainberg M.A. Le Grice S.F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10063-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it appeared unlikely that T + 14 pausing was mediated through an interaction with the tRNA anticodon loop previously reported for the HIV-1 (mal isolate) system. However, inspection of the sequence of tRNALys,3 indicated that base pairing might occur between U5-IR loop nucleotides and those at the extreme 5′ terminus of the tRNA primer (Fig. 1 D). Fig.2 B indicates this potential intermolecular duplex would start 16 nucleotides upstream from the initiation site, which would be 2 nucleotides removed from the T + 14 pause site (Fig. 1 B). The extreme 5′ terminus of tRNALys,3 would be available for this interaction following hybridization of the 18 3′ nucleotides to the PBS. Thus, while the U5-IR loop of another lentivirus is again implicated in control of (−)-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis, involvement of 5′ nucleotides of the tRNA primer represents a mechanism unlike those that have been documented previously (9Cobrinik D.

Prior to a more extensive evaluation of tRNA-primed initiation in FIV, it was important to establish that U5-IR loop nucleotides of the viral genome were available for hybridization with the 5′ terminus of tRNALys,3 and subsequently involved in intermolecular base pairing following its association with the PBS. The folding diagram of Fig. 2 B predicts an extensively paired U5-IR stem with an 8-nucleotide loop at its apex. The same figure also predicts that the majority of PBS nucleotides are paired in the absence of the tRNA primer, and in the immediate vicinity of a hairpin structure whose loop is U-rich. 5′-End-labeled viral RNA was therefore subjected to mild digestion with the nucleases S1 and T1, which recognize single-stranded regions of nucleic acid and unpaired G residues in RNA, respectively. Subsequently, nuclease mapping was performed in the presence of full-le"

Each subunit contains extensive β-sheet structure and is arranged within a dimer of dimers to form a compact molecule with two funnel-shaped hormone ligand binding sites, each defined by a dimer-dimer interface. The thyroid hormones bind deeply within the hydrophobic binding channel, their iodinyl moieties residing in hydrophobic pockets at two different binding sites within the channel (6Wojtczak A. Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Upon binding of one T4 ligand, the binding affinity for the second ligand is reduced significantly. Although the TTR tetramer is inherently very stable (1Nilsson S.F. Rack L. Peterson P. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1972; 152: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in some circumstances transthyretin has a propensity to form amyloid fibrils. In diseases such as senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathies, native and mutant TTR, respectively have been found to form long beta-sheet based fibrillar structures (8Saraiva M.J.M. J. Periph. Nerv. Syst. 1996; 1: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). These amyloid lesions accumulate in specific organs and are implicated in their dysfunction and ultimately the death of the patients. More than 70 separate mutations that appear to increase the propensity of TTR to form amyloid structures underlying familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy have so far been identified (10Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 11McCutchen S.L. Lai Z. Miroy G.J. Kelly J.W. Colon W.

Invest. 1996; 3: 44-56Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It is thought that the underlying mechanism for TTR fibril formation involves tetramer dissociation to a monomeric conformational intermediate which self-assembles to form amyloid fibrils. Any mutation or cellular condition (such as low pH) that tends to destabilize the tetramer can result in an increased propensity of the protein to form amyloid fibrils (9Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 11McCutchen S.L. Lai Z. Miroy G.J. Kelly J.W. Colon W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13527-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The ligand binding properties of TTR have become of major importance recently, with the discovery that certain thyroid hormone competitors (e.g. 2,4,6-triiodophenol) are able to decrease the tendency of TTR to form amyloid fibrils (15Miroy G.J. Lai Z. Lashuel H.A. Peterson S.A. Strang C. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15051-15056Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 16Peterson S.A. Klabunde T. Lashuel H.A. Purkey H. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12956-12960Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). They are reported to act by binding deeply within the TTR binding channel at both ligand binding sites and inhibiting the formation of amyloid by stabilizing the normal fold against the pathogenic conformational change. A range of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being investigated for their ability to inhibit and reverse amyloid formation (17Klabunde T. Petrassi H.M. Oza V.B. Raman P. Kelly J.W. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). While crystallographic information has revealed the orientations of several of these drugs bound to TTR, there are many aspects of the ligand binding that cannot be probed using crystallographic techniques. These include dynamic aspects of protein-ligand binding in solution and in the presence of competitors or in the presence of other serum proteins, including the other thyroid hormone carriers albumin and thyroxine-binding globulin. For such studies, it is possible that NMR spectroscopic methods could be employed. NMR can be used to observe the interaction of a ligand with particular sites in the protein. Such studies currently depend upon the assignment of the specific resonances that are perturbed by the ligand (18Shuker S.B. Hajduk P.J. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar), which limits studies to systems in which the protein signal of interest is either fortuitously distinct or has been fully assigned using isotopic labeling and heteronuclear NMR techniques. In the latter case, this also requires that the protein is less than about 40 kDa due to the broad line widths of the NMR signals and large number of signals that have similar chemical shifts. The problem can be somewhat reduced by using chemical ligation strategies in which just one portion of the protein is isotopically labeled (19Xu R. Ayers B. Coburn D. Muir T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Of even greater value would be the ability to completely control the position of the isotopic label in a protein for probing the ligand interaction. The current study thus presents the first stage in the development of a spectroscopic method for probing a protein-ligand interaction. The strategy involves the complete synthesis of a TTR analog using solid phase synthesis and chemical ligation techniques and refolding of the protein to a tertiary and quaternary structure that approximates the native form. Since the structure of TTR is known to atomic resolution from x-ray crystallographic studies, an NMR active probe (i.e. 15N- or 13C-labeled amino acid) may be incorporated at any strategic position to enable subsequent ligand binding studies to be manifest in NMR spectra. The chemical synthesis of proteins of the size of the monomeric unit of TTR (127 residues) represents a significant challenge. In the past, long peptides were synthesized in a stepwise fashion, as exemplified by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease (20Schneider J. Kent S.B.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 363-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and interleukin-8 (21Rajarathnam K. Kay C.M. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 287: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but significant purification problems resulted in low yields of protein. Currently, the synthesis techniques for proteins of this size rely on chemoselective ligation techniques, where two or more nonprotected peptides are joined through a highly selective chemical reaction. There have been several notable protein syntheses described using chemoselective ligation techniques that incorporate thioester and thioether surrogate amide bonds. These include the synthesis of linked heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (22Canne L.E. Ferre- D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Kent S.B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2998-3007Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and Cpn10 (23Ball H.L. Giuliani P. Lucietto P. Fossati G. Mascagni P. Biomed. Pept. Proteins Nucleic Acids. 1994; 1: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Recently, techniques for forming a native amide bond have been applied to a range of protein types including serine protease inhibitors (24Lu W. Qasim M.A. Kent S.B.H. J. Am. Chem.

Native chemical ligation chemistry is only useful provided there are suitably positioned cysteines. In order to synthesize a protein like transthyretin without suitably located cysteines, it becomes necessary to use chemically modified amino acid substitutes or amino acid mutations. The thioether ligation strategy we use here introduces -NH-CH2-CH2-S-CH2-CO-, which mimics a two-amino acid subunit closely resembling a glycyl-glycine (-NH-CH2-CO-NH-CH2-CO-). While the thioether moiety closely resembles the spatial requirements for glycyl-glycine, it may lack potential hydrogen bond donation/acceptor behavior of the diamino acid unit, thereby potentially introducing some nonnative structural characteristics. Here we demonstrate the total chemical synthesis of an analog of human TTR through the use of the thioether strategy for the sequential ligation of three peptides. We also show that this synthetic TTR (henceforth referred to as sTTR) may be successfully refolded and reconstituted to form a 54-kDa tetrameric structure able to bind the thyroid hormone T4. This represents one of the largest active proteins made synthetically and provides methodology for future protein-ligand investigations using NMR spectroscopic techniques.

Commun. 1983; 114: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized using the rapid manualO-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate in situ neutralization synthesis technique (31Schnoelzer M. Alewood P. Jones A.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 8871-8874Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), initially on amino methyl resins and then subsequently Boc-amino acid-Pam resins (ABI). The bromoacetyl and chloroacetyl groups at the amino termini of peptides were coupled using the symmetrical anhydride formed from reaction with N,N-diisopropylcarbodiimide. The dinitrophenyl group was removed using 20% mercaptoethanol in 10% diisopropylethylamine/N,N-dimethyl formamide solution for two or three 30-min treatments. The Trp formyl deprotection was carried out using ethanolamine prior to HF cleavage. Peptide resins were cleaved using HF with p-cresol andp-thiocresol as scavengers at −5 to 0 °C for 1–2 h. The HF was removed in vacuo, the peptide product was triturated with cold diethyl ether (3 × 50 ml), and the precipitated peptide was collected and dissolved in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The crude peptides were purified by reverse phase (RP)-HPLC, and fractions were collected and analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS). Fractions containing the purified peptide were combined and lyophilized. PeptideI (see Fig. 2) was synthesized on a Boc-Glu(O-benzyl)-Pam-polystyrene resin (ABI) on a 0.5-mmol scale. Amino acid couplings averaged 99.5% efficiency.N-Boc deprotection and coupling of bromoacetic acid followed by HF cleavage gave the crude peptide, which was purified by preparative HPLC using a linear gradient of 0–70% B. The peptide was then analyzed by HPLC and ESMS. The purified peptide was characterized as the desired product (I) by ESMS (observed mass = 3021 ± 0.3; calculated for C133 H210N34 O41 Br1 = 3021.24 (average isotope composition)). The C-terminal thiol peptide IIwas manually synthesized using the thiol linker attached to Boc-Ala-Pam resin in the first synthesis and then Boc-Gly-Pam resin for the second.

The C-terminal thiol peptide III was synthesized using machine-assisted synthesis. The peptide was synthesized using the thiol linker attached to Boc-Gly-Pam resin. The average amino acid coupling was 99.6% (1st coupling) for the synthesis, which was routinely double coupled. The dinitrophenyl protecting group was removed, followed by N-Boc and then the formyl group. The peptide was cleaved from the resin, and the crude peptide was purified by preparative HPLC using a linear gradient of 0–70% B. The peptide was then analyzed by HPLC and ESMS. The purified peptide was characterized as the desired product (III) by ESMS (observed mass = 5355 ± 1.0; calculated for C236 H379 N66 O72S2 = 5357.14 (average isotope composition)). The ligation reaction was initiated by mixing the two peptides, bromoacetyl-102–127 TTR (I) (5.44 mg, 1.8 mmol) and chloroacetyl-54–99-NH-CH2-CH2-SH (II) (6.84 mg, 1.26 mmol), in 1 ml of 6 m urea 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, under nitrogen. After mixing, the reaction mixture was left to stand at room temperature for 24 h. Samples were withdrawn at 0, 1, 2, and 20 h during this period for HPLC and ESMS analysis. The ligated peptide IV was isolated from the reaction mixture by semipreparative HPLC using a linear gradient of 0–70% B. The fractions were analyzed by HPLC and ESMS; the fractions containing the ligated peptide were then lyophilized. The purified peptide IV (6.01 mg) was characterized as the desired product IV by ESMS (observed mass = 8355 ± 1.2; calculated for C379H572N92O117S1Cl1= 8356.8 (average isotope composition)). Peptide IV (5.46 mg, 0.654 mmol) was dissolved in 8 m urea 0.01m NaOAc pH 7.5 (1 ml), and KI was added to saturation (∼8m). After placing under nitrogen, a sample was removed at 30 min, purified by HPLC, and analyzed by ESMS to check completion of the iodo exchange. The iodoacetyl peptide V was then purified by semipreparative HPLC and lyophilized to give 3.64 mg. The peptide was characterized as the desired product V by ESMS (observed mass = 8447 ± 1.0; calculated for C379H572N92O117S1Cl1= 8448.2 (average isotope composition)). Ligation of the two peptides iodoacetyl-54–99-NH-CH2-CH2-SH V (3.46 mg, 0.43 mmol) and 1–51-NH-CH2-CH2-SH III (3.58 mg, 6.68 mmol) was initiated by mixing the two peptides in 6 m urea, 0.2 mNaHCO3, pH 8.3 (500 ml) and placing under nitrogen. The reaction was mixed and then left to stand at room temperature for 5 h. Samples were withdrawn at 0, 1.5, and 4 h for HPLC and ESMS analysis. The ligated peptide VI was isolated from the reaction mixture by semipreparative HPLC using a linear gradient of 0–70% B. The fractions were analyzed by HPLC and ESMS; the fractions containing the ligated peptide were then lyophilized to giveVI (2.76 mg). The purified peptide was characterized as the desired product VI by ESMS (observed mass = 13,676 ± 1.3; calculated for C615H949N158O189S3= 13,676.4 (average isotope composition)). The ligated peptide (1–51-ψ-54–99-ψ-102–127) (VI) (0.25 mg) was dissolved in 0.075 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.3 (100 µl) and then diluted with 100 µl of H2O. To this solution was added 5 µl of thyroxine T4 (5 mg/ml in 0.1 mNaOH). After equilibrating at room temperature for 18 h, the tetrameric protein was isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (HR10/30; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; calibrated with phosphorylase, 97 kDa; bovine albumin, 66 kDa; native TTR, 54 kDa; ovalbumin, 45 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 30 kDa; soya bean trypsin inhibitor, 20.1 kDa, and α-lactalbumin, 14.4 kDa) with 0.075m NH4HCO3 10% CH3CN as the eluent at 0.3 ml/min. The tetrameric protein was isolated at a retention time of 22 min as determined by its equivalent retention time to that of native TTR. It was kept in solution in the presence of excess T4 prior to further analysis. 2 µl of human serum, 25 µl (0.5 µg) of sTTR solution, and 50 µl (1.0 µg) of sTTR were separated in a 0.1% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, using a stacking gel of 4.5% acrylamide, pH 6.8, and a resolving gel of 15% acrylamide, pH 8.6 (34Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, following which the membrane was blocked. The primary antibody was 1:5000 antiserum raised in a rabbit against a mixture of TTRs purified from serum from human (Homo sapiens) wallaby (Macropus eugenii), and chicken (Gallus gallus), and the secondary antibody was 1:10,000 anti-rabbit Ig raised in sheep (Silenus), as described previously (35Richardson S.J. Wettenhall R.E.H. Schreiber G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Detection achieved was using enhanced chemiluminescence against x-ray film. Commercially available l-[125I]thyroxine was found to contain up to 5% 125I− on the reference date. Therefore, [125I]thyroxine was separated from125I− and other degradation products by reversed phase chromatography using a SepPak C-18 cartridge column (36Mendel C.M. Cavalieri R.R. Gavin L.A. Pettersson T. Inoue M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purification was checked by thin layer chromatography followed by autoradiography (37Pardridge W.M. Mietus L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Commercially purchased [125I]thyroxine was purified from degradation products and 125I−as described above. Methylcellulose charcoal was prepared as described by Chang et al. (38Chang L. Munro S.L.A. Richardson S.J. Schreiber G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In order to remove thyroxine from the solution containing sTTR, 40 µl of methylcellulose-charcoal (1%) in Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The methylcellulose-charcoal was resuspended in a 160-µl solution containing 3.2 µg of sTTR. The mixture was kept at 4 °C for half an hour, with mixing each 10 min. The solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed for analysis of [125I]thyroxine binding to sTTR. 10 µl of human serum and 80 µl of solution containing sTTR (1.6 µg) were incubated with 1.1 fmol (2.4 nCi) of purified [125I]thyroxine (room temperature for 1 h), and a second aliquot of 80 µl of solution containing sTTR (1.6 µg) was incubated with 4.4 fmol (9.6 nCi) of purified [125I]thyroxine (room temperature for 1 h). 5 µl of human serum and the total amounts of sTTR solutions were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10% acrylamide, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 4 °C (39Richardson S.J. Bradley A.J. Duan W. Wettenhall R.E.H. Harms P.J. Babon J.J. Southwell B.R. Nicol S. Donnellan S.C. Schreiber G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1359-R1370PubMed Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography. The choice of ligation sites for the preparation of sTTR was based on both the amino acid sequence and the known tertiary structure of the TTR molecule (Fig.1, A and B) and involved the ligation of three peptides (Fig. 1 C). While the ligation of two peptides, each of 60–65 residues in length, is a possible alternative strategy, the degree of difficulty of preparing and purifying peptides of this length is comparable with the difficulty of a second ligation. In addition, since all of the residues considered for future labeling studies occur within the last 30 residues, it was desirable to prepare a relatively small C-terminal fragment. It was anticipated that this approach would increase the ease of preparing several sTTR molecules with selective labels, since only this fragment would need to be resynthesized. The thioether linker spans a distance equivalent to two amino acids, is highly flexible, and is nonfunctionalized. While Gly-Gly sequences are thus ideally suited as ligation points, the TTR sequence contains no Gly-Gly site, although several Ser-Gly sites are present at convenient positions. Two of these Ser-Gly sites exist in loop positions within the TTR structure, which were considered to be potentially more tolerant of surrogate amide bonds than β-sheet or helical regions. Ser100-Gly101 occurs in the loop between β-strands F and G, and Ser52-Gly53 occurs in the loop between β-strands C and D. Neither are close to the hormone binding site or at points of intersubunit contact. A third Ser-Gly site (Ser46-Gly47) occurs in the center of β-strand C and was ruled out as a potential ligation point due to the likely disruption of the β-sheet by a surrogate amide. The selection of Ser52-Gly53 and Ser100-Gly101 ligation sites required the synthesis of three peptides of 51, 46, and 26 residues. The ligation strategy for the three peptides is outlined in Fig.2. The N-bromoacetylated 102–127 (peptide I) is ligated to theN-chloroacetylated, C-thiolated 54–99 (peptideII). The ligation proceeds preferentially between the thiol and the bromoacetyl groups, so that polymerization of the peptideII should not occur. The purified chloroacetylated 54–127 (peptide IV) may then undergo simultaneous or sequential exchange to the iodoacetylated form (peptide V) and ligation with C-thiolated 1–51 (peptide III) to produce fully ligated 1–127 (peptide VI). In addition to nonnative bonds, one other modification was made to sTTR. Cysteine 10 was replaced with alanine in order to avoid any problems of competition for the iodoacetyl peptide fragment during the ligation reaction and to exclude the possibility of oxidation when the protein was folded. Alanine was chosen due to its similarity in bulk and hydrophobicity to cysteine. This was considered unlikely to have any detrimental effect on the folding or activity of TTR. Trial syntheses of the peptides I, II, and III were carried out to see how each of the peptides would behave during the synthesis, cleavage, and ligation reactions. This preliminary work showed that all three peptides could be readily synthesized, cleaved from the resin, and purified, excepting the middle fragment, which tended to retain the methylphenoxyacetic acid (AMPA) linker at the C-terminal thiol after HF treatment. This was detected as a result of cleavage at the C-terminal amino acid attached to the resin on which the peptide-AMPA linker was synthesized (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Despite this, the three target peptides were obtained in good yield and purity. Ligation of peptides I and II proceeded cleanly to give peptide IV (Fig. 2). The purification and monitoring of the ligation reaction was complicated by the fact that the ligated peptideIV co-elutes with the starting peptide II; thus, the use of an excess of peptide I was required to drive the reaction to completion. After 2 h, the starting peptideII could not be detected, and the ligated peptideIV was present in high yield as judged by HPLC and ESMS (Fig. 3, A and B). The ligation was le"

The initial step consists of the formation of a 30 S subunit ternary complex with the mRNA. This complex includes three initiation factors, IF1, IF2, and IF3, tRNAfMet, and GTP, which is required for its formation. Furthermore, the 30 S subunit is guided to the initiation region by RNA-RNA base pairing between 16 S rRNA and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, where this complex is converted into a stable initiation complex (1Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). During initiation, IF3 binds to the small subunit of the ribosome (30 S), preventing the joining of 50 S subunits, whereas IF1 and IF2 bind to the 30 S-IF3 complex. IF2 promotes the binding of the initiator tRNA to this complex in a GTP-dependent manner (1Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). This factor belongs to the family of GTPases that are molecular switches capable of alternating between an active (IF2-GTP) and an inactive (IF2-GDP) conformation (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A.

Under steady state conditions, initiation is the predominant rate-limiting step for translation of most mRNAs; thus, protein synthesis is often regulated at this early stage.

Plastids and mitochondria are semiautonomous organelles that possess their own genome but rely on the nucleus for most of their structural proteins and the regulatory factors that control the expression of their genes.

For example, many components of the chloroplast transcriptional and translational machinery are homologous to the eubacterial counterpart and have been identified by their similarity with the corresponding cyanobacteria or E. coli genes (7Stern D.B. Higgs D.C. Yang J. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 308-315Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 16Martin W. Hermann R.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 9-17Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 17Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 149-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 18Harris E.H. Boynton J.E. Gihamn N.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 700-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chloroplast genomes from many land plants have been completely sequenced (15Sugiura M. Hirose T. Sugita M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 437-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis from these genomes indicates that only IF1 is encoded in the chloroplast, suggesting that IF2 and IF3 are nuclear-encoded in land plants (16Martin W. Hermann R.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 9-17Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Although some chloroplast translational initiation factors have been identified and purified from algae, none of these factors have been characterized from plants. In this work, we report the cloning and molecular characterization of a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic IF2 gene from common bean (PvIF2cp). The PvIF2cp gene encodes a putative 108.7-kDa polypeptide that presents a chloroplast translocation signal peptide. Our data indicate that the PvIF2cp transcript accumulation is modulated by light. An increase in mRNA levels was detected when plants were transferred from dark to light growth conditions. Also, high accumulation of PvIF2cptranscript was found in photosynthetic tissues contrasting with the low mRNA levels detected in etiolated plants as well as in nonphotosynthetic organs. We also show that the PvIF2cp gene encodes a functional factor, since the PvIF2cp conserved region containing the G-domain and the C-terminal end is able to complement an E. coli infB null mutation in vivo. Finally, phylogenetic analysis using the PvIF2cp conserved region, which seems to be a useful marker for organism phylogeny reconstruction, suggests that PvIF2cp gene originated via endosymbiotic gene transfer to the nucleus and favors the monophyletic origin of primary plastids. To our knowledge, this is the first nuclear-encoded chloroplastic IF2 gene characterized in higher plants. Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. negro Jamapa seeds were kindly provided by Dr. J. Acosta (Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales y Agropecuarias, Texcoco, Mexico). Seeds germinated after 3 days were transferred to pots and grown under greenhouse conditions with natural light as indicated (19Villanueva M.A. Campos F. Diaz C. Colmenero-Flores J.M. Dantán E. Sanchez F. Covarrubias A.A. Planta. 1999; 207: 582-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Lara M. Porta H. Padilla J.E. Folch J. Sanchez F. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mature plants were harvested 25 days after sowing, and leaves, stems, and roots were collected. For the light induction experiments, 3-day-germinated seedlings were transplanted to vermiculite and grown in the dark at 27 °C for 2 days; seedlings were then transferred to a greenhouse for 24 h. Control seedlings were kept in the dark. To obtain etiolated plants, 25-day-old plants grown under greenhouse conditions were transferred to dark conditions for 72 h. Abscisic acid and water-stress treatments were carried out as previously described (21Colmenero-Flores J.M. Campos F. Garciarrubio A. Covarrubias A.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After harvest, tissues were frozen immediately in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The differential screening of a Ph. vulgaris λgt11 cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from leaves of 21-day-old bean plants exposed to a water-deficit was performed as described (21Colmenero-Flores J.M. Campos F. Garciarrubio A. Covarrubias A.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). From this screening, clones induced and repressed by a water deficit were isolated. Positive plaques were purified, and the inserts were subcloned into pKS+ vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. To obtain the corresponding genomic clone, a Ph. vulgaris genomic library was screened by standard techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using as probe a 32P-labeled fragment from thePvIF2cpcDNA clone. The λ DASH genomic library used was a kind gift of H. Porta and M. Rocha (Instituto de Biotecnologia, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México). DNA manipulations were performed using standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Appropriate DNA fragments from both cDNA and genomic PvIF2cpclones were subcloned into pKS+ vector (Stratagene) and sequenced using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence data were analyzed using the software of the University of Wisconsin GCG. Available data bases were extensively searched for PvIF2 homologous sequences by using BLASTP program (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences were manually edited to use for this analysis the IF2-conserved region. IF2 was aligned with PILEUP (GCG). Maximum parsimony analysis was done with PAUP4b2 (24Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other Methods) Version 4. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2000Google Scholar) using heuristic searches with 100 replicates of random additions and tree bisection reconnection (TBR)-swapping algorithm with no limit on the maximum number of trees and declaring gaps as missing data. The tree was rooted using the yeast, plant, and animal mitochondrial IF2 sequences as out-groups. Statistical support of the clades found was based on 100 pseudoreplicates using the Bootstrap procedure (52Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values shown in the nodes correspond to Bootstrap percentage values. Nodes without values had Bootstrap values lower than 50%. The analyzed IF2 proteins are as follows: Arabidopsis thaliana 1 (AAC35536), A. thaliana 2 (AC007651.2), Bacillus halodurans (AP001515), Bacillus stearothermophilus(X04399), Bacillus subtilis (Z99112), Borrelia burgdorferi (AE001179), Bos taurus (L37835),Buchnera sp.

IF2 amino acid sequence was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute web site. Total RNA (25 µg) obtained by the “hot phenol” method (25Pawlowski K. Kunze R. de Vries S. Bisseling T. Plant Molecular Biology Manual, D5. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 1-13Google Scholar) was size-fractionated into 1.0% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon membranes (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization conditions and membrane washing were carried out at high stringency (26Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). To detect thePvIF2cp transcript, a SmaI-PstI fragment from pJAS1 was used as a probe (Fig. 1). As controls, additional transcripts were detected. Rubisco mRNA was identified using as a probe a Ph. vulgaris rbcS cDNA (27Covarrubias A.A. Garciarrubio A. Roca W.M. Mayer J.E. Pastor-Corrales M.A. Thome J. Proceedings of the Second International Scientific Meeting: Phaseolus Beans Advanced Research Network, September 7–10, Cali, Colombia, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical, Cali, Colombia1994Google Scholar). ThePh. vulgaris cDNA insert in PLACT-6 was used to probe actin transcripts (19Villanueva M.A. Campos F. Diaz C. Colmenero-Flores J.M. Dantán E. Sanchez F. Covarrubias A.A. Planta. 1999; 207: 582-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). rsP24, a Ph. vulgaris cDNA clone, was used for detection of lipid transfer protein mRNA (21Colmenero-Flores J.M. Campos F. Garciarrubio A. Covarrubias A.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against the PvIF2cp fused to glutathione S-transferase. To obtain the fusion protein, theSmaI-BglII fragment, encoding the PvIF-2cp-conserved region, was inserted into the pGEX2T expression vector (28Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). After IPTG1induction, the glutathione S-transferase-PvIF2cp protein was purified using glutathione-agarose beads (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 16.7.1-16.7Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised in rabbits using purified glutathione S-transferase-PvIF2cp fusion protein. SDS-boiling lysates were obtained from C118 and SL598R cultures grown to an A 600 of 1.0. To induce the PvIF2cp overexpression in C112 strain, IPTG (1 mm) was added to cultures grown to anA 600 of 0.5, and lysates were obtained when cultures reach an A 600 of 1.0. Strains were grown at 37 °C, except in the case of SL598R, which was grown at the permissive temperature (30 °C). Total protein extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). A 1:1000 dilution of the anti-PvIF2cp antibody and a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were used (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA region encoding the first 92 amino acids of PvIF2cp, which corresponds to the putative transit peptide, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-GAGGGATCCGTGGGGTGGACTCAGC-3′ and 5′-TATCCATGGTACTACTTACTACTACTATTAC-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted in-frame into the NcoI-BamHI site of the GFP expression vector (HBT-SGFP-TYG-nos plasmid) (31Sheen J. Hwang S. Niwa Y. Kobayashi H. Galbrait D.W. Plant J. 1995; 8: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 32Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The regions surrounding the insertion sites in the resulting plasmid, pJAS11, were verified by sequencing. Protoplasts were isolated from 5–6-week-old tobacco leaves (ecotype W38) grown in a controlled growth chamber with a 16:8-h light:dark photoperiod at 24 °C. The protoplast preparation and the transformation procedure were carried out according to Abel and Theologis (33Abel S. Theologis A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To allow for expression, protoplasts were incubated in the dark for 24 h. GFP was visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop Universal microscope equipped with epi-fluorescence condenser III RS and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set comprising exciter filter (BP 450-490), chromatic beam splitter (FT 510), and barrier filter (LP 520). The light source was provided by a HBO 50 W high pressure mercury bulb. The microscope is equipped with an interference filter to block the chlorophyll autofluorescence. Photographs were taken using Kodak Gold400 color film. An N terminus deletion of the PvIF2cp gene was constructed by polymerase chain reaction using the PvIF2cp cDNA as template and specific primers designed to incorporate an additional NcoI site. This modification did not generate any change in the amino acid sequence and left the methionine at position 411 as the initial amino acid. The NcoI-BglII 2.0-kilobase fragment containing a PvIF2cpcDNA-truncated version was inserted into the E. coliexpression vector pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce the pJAS3 plasmid (see Fig. 1). In vivo complementation experiments were carried out as described (34Bremaud L. Laalami S. Derijard B. Cenatiempos Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2348-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protocol is based on the presence of a thermosensitive λ lysogen containing theinfB gene in the SL598R strain, which lacks a functional chromosomal IF2. Under permissive temperatures, the wild typeinfB gene, present in the λ lysogen, will provide the IF2, and cells will survive. Under nonpermissive temperatures (42 °C), bacterial IF2 is not produced, and cells die unless a homologous or heterologous IF2 is able to complement the infB function (35Laalami S. Putzer H. Plumbridge J.A. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strain SL598R was transformed with plasmids pJAS3 or pB18-1. Plasmid pB18-1, a pBR322 derivative containing the E. coli nusA-infB genes, was used as positive control (35Laalami S. Putzer H. Plumbridge J.A. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Complementation experiments were carried out as follows. Transformed cells were grown overnight in Luria broth with ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 µg/ml), diluted in fresh medium, and grown at 30 °C to A 600 1.0. Cultures were diluted toA 600 0.3, and 0.5-ml aliquots were transferred to 5 ml of 42 °C prewarmed Luria broth, shaken vigorously for 5 min, and immediately chilled on ice. Aliquots of 1.5 ml were concentrated by centrifugation at 4 °C, plated on Luria broth plates containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and incubated at 42 °C. In the case of strain SL598R containing plasmid pJAS3, PvIF2cpexpression was induced with 1 mm IPTG for 1 h. Survivors were purified several times at 42 °C, and the loss of λ lysogen phage was verified by their sensitivity to λ cI−. Complementation was recorded as frequency of cured cells. By screening a bean water-stressed leaf cDNA library, several cDNA clones down-regulated by water deficit were isolated (27Covarrubias A.A. Garciarrubio A. Roca W.M. Mayer J.E. Pastor-Corrales M.A. Thome J. Proceedings of the Second International Scientific Meeting: Phaseolus Beans Advanced Research Network, September 7–10, Cali, Colombia, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical, Cali, Colombia1994Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of one of these clones, pJAS1 (2.4 kbp), has significant similarity to prokaryotic and organellar translation initiation factors (IF2). Since these factors have not been described in higher plants, we decided to further characterize this gene. To isolate a full-length IF2 cDNA clone, 1 × 106 plaque-forming units from a stressed leaf λ library were probed with the 5′-end of the insert in pJAS1, obtained as a 0.75-kbp SmaI-EcoRI fragment (Fig.1 A). A positive clone containing a 3.2-kbp insert (pJAS2) was isolated and sequenced. Even though the insert in pJAS2 contains most of the PvIF2cDNA, the corresponding initiation codon was not present. Thus, a bean genomic library was screened using as probe the insert in pJAS2. From this screening, we isolated an IF2 λ clone containing a 10-kbpNotI genomic fragment (Fig. 1 A). Restriction mapping and sequence analysis of both genomic and cDNA clones indicated that they correspond to the same IF2 gene. Fig. 1 Ashows the physical map of the PvIF2 genomic fragment, in which two introns were detected. Genomic hybridizations suggest that the PvIF2 gene is present as a single copy in the Ph. vulgaris genome (data not shown). The putative PvIF2transcript contains a 3.027- kilobase open reading frame and a 336-bp 3′-untranslated region, which includes the poly(A)+ tail. The deduced protein sequence corresponds to a polypeptide of 1009 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 108.7 kDa (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the PvIF2 gene using the BLASTP program indicated that this protein is similar to the eubacterial and organellar translational initiation factor 2. A low similarity was detected with the archaeal-type IF2 (Fig. 2). A region with extensive similarity among the different IF2s compared was found between amino acids 488 and 604 of the PvIF2 polypeptide (Figs.1 B and 2). This domain corresponds to a putative GTP-binding site shown to be functional in several translation factors (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 3Laalami S. Sacerdot C. Vachon G. Mortensen K. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Cenatiempo Y. Grunberg-Manago M. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Severini M. Spurio R. La Teana A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22800-22802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PvIF2 G-domain showed all characteristic motifs identified in this region (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 B and 2). Whereas at the C-terminal region the similarity to different IF2s is also appreciable (31–63%), the N terminus from PvIF2 exhibits nonsignificant similarity to other known IF2s (28–35%) (Fig. 2). Analysis of the PvIF2 N terminus using the program PSORT (36Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar) revealed that the first 90 amino acids from this gene present the features of chloroplast transit peptides (Fig. 1 B). This region also contains a putative cleavage site at position 48–49, predicted by the program ChloroP (37Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Although no consensus amino acid sequences for chloroplast transit peptides have been defined (38Bruce B.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 440-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), the PvIF2 putative 48-amino acid chloroplast-targeting peptide shows an overall amino acid composition similar to that present in bona fide chloroplast transit peptides (39von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). This analysis suggested that this PvIF2 corresponds to a nuclear-encoded chloroplast translation initiation factor 2 (PvIF2cp). To determine the functionality of the PvIF2 N terminus as a chloroplast transit peptide, a recombinant plasmid (pJAS11) encoding a chimeric protein in which the first 90 amino acids from PvIF2 are fused to the GFP was introduced into tobacco protoplasts via electroporation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fluorescence analysis showed that the GFP fusion containing the putative PvIF2 chloroplast transit peptide (pJAS11) was localized into tobacco chloroplast (Fig.3, a–d). A similar localization pattern was observed for the GFP fusion containing the transit peptide of the nuclear Rubisco gene, RBCS1A, fromA. thaliana (Fig. 3, e and f) (32Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In contrast, GFP without the targeting sequence showed a diffuse accumulation pattern in tobacco protoplasts, with no particular localization (Fig. 3, g and h). These results lead us to conclude that indeed this sequence corresponds to a true transit peptide and targets PvIF2 to chloroplasts. To determine the relative abundance ofPvIF2cp transcript in different organs from bean plants, Northern blots were carried out using total RNA from roots, stems, and leaves from mature photosynthetic plants. As shown in Fig.4, a transcript of the expected size (3.5 kbp) was detected in leaf tissues but not in root or stem tissues. Since these results suggested that the PvIF2cp transcript abundance might be modulated by light, the PvIF2cptranscript accumulation levels were examined in leaves from etiolated and greening seedlings. The results in Fig. 4 B showed thatPvIF2cp transcript is highly accumulated in leaf tissues from greening seedlings, but it was undetectable in etiolated seedlings as well as in mature 3-day dark-grown plants (Fig. 4 B,lanes 4 and 2, respectively). Additionally, thePvIF2cp light response was confirmed in experiments where dark-grown seedlings were transferred to light conditions. An increase in the accumulation levels of the PvIF2cp transcript was detected after 24 h in the presence of light (Fig. 4 B,lane 3). In contrast, when plants were transferred from light to dark growth conditions, the PvIF2cp transcript accumulation levels declined after 72 h (Fig. 4 B,lane 2). The Rubisco transcript, known to be u"
https://openalex.org/W1973981037,"Abstract Aspartate transcarbamoylase undergoes a domain closure in the catalytic chains upon binding of the substrates that initiates the allosteric transition. Interdomain bridging interactions between Glu50 and both Arg167 and Arg234 have been shown to be critical for stabilization of the R state. A hybrid version of the enzyme has been generated in vitro containing one wild-type catalytic subunit, one catalytic subunit in which Glu50 in each catalytic chain has been replaced by Ala (E50A), and wild-type regulatory subunits. Thus, the hybrid enzyme has one catalytic subunit capable of domain closure and one catalytic subunit incapable of domain closure. The hybrid does not behave as a simple mixture of the constituent subunits; it exhibits lower catalytic activity and higher aspartate affinity than would be expected. As opposed to the wild-type enzyme, the hybrid is inhibited allosterically by CTP at saturating substrate concentrations. As opposed to the E50A holoenzyme, the hybrid is not allosterically activated by ATP at saturating substrate concentrations. Small angle x-ray scattering showed that three of the six interdomain bridging interactions in the hybrid is sufficient to cause the global structural change to the R state, establishing the critical nature of these interactions for the allosteric transition of aspartate transcarbamoylase."
