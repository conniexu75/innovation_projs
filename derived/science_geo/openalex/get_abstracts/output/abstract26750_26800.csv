https://openalex.org/W2061385217,"A cDNA encoding the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin was transfected into highly invasive epithelial tumor cell lines of dog kidney or mouse mammary gland origin. Transfectants with a homogeneously high expression of E-cadherin showed a reproducible loss of activity in two types of in vitro invasion assays. Invasiveness of these transfectants could be reinduced specifically by treatment with anti-E-cadherin antibodies. In vivo, they formed partly differentiated tumors, instead of fully undifferentiated tumors. Alternatively, a plasmid encoding E-cadherin-specific anti-sense RNA was introduced into noninvasive ras-transformed cells with high endogenous E-cadherin expression. The resulting down-regulation, albeit partial, rendered the cells invasive. These data provide direct evidence that E-cadherin acts as an invasion suppressor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2012116939,"The c-abl proto-oncogene, which encodes a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase, is expressed throughout murine gestation and ubiquitously in adult mouse tissues. However, its levels are highest in thymus, spleen, and testes. To examine the in vivo role of c-abl, the gene was disrupted in embryonic stem cells, and the resulting genetically modified cells were used to establish a mouse strain carrying the mutation. Most mice homozygous for the c-abl mutation became runted and died 1 to 2 weeks after birth. In addition, many showed thymic and splenic atrophy and a T and B cell lymphopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2092246706,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most widely distributed known inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain. GABA also serves regulatory and trophic roles in several other organs, including the pancreas. The brain contains two forms of the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), which differ in molecular size, amino acid sequence, antigenicity, cellular and subcellular location, and interaction with the GAD co-factor pyridoxal phosphate. These forms, GAD65 and GAD67, derive from two genes. The distinctive properties of the two GADS provide a substrate for understanding not only the multiple roles of GABA in the nervous system, but also the autoimmune response to GAD in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W1984931175,"Traditional approaches to neural coding characterize the encoding of known stimuli in average neural responses. Organisms face nearly the opposite task--extracting information about an unknown time-dependent stimulus from short segments of a spike train. Here the neural code was characterized from the point of view of the organism, culminating in algorithms for real-time stimulus estimation based on a single example of the spike train. These methods were applied to an identified movement-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system. Such decoding experiments determined the effective noise level and fault tolerance of neural computation, and the structure of the decoding algorithms suggested a simple model for real-time analog signal processing with spiking neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2038443908,"Oskar is one of seven Drosophila maternal-effect genes that are necessary for germline and abdomen formation. We have cloned oskar and show that oskar RNA is localized to the posterior pole of the oocyte when germ plasm forms. This polar distribution of oskar RNA is established during oogenesis in three phases: accumulation in the oocyte, transport toward the posterior, and finally maintenance at the posterior pole of the oocyte. The colocalization of oskar and nanos in wild-type and bicaudal embryos suggests that oskar directs localization of the posterior determinant nanos. We propose that the pole plasm is assembled stepwise and that continued interaction among its components is required for germ cell determination."
https://openalex.org/W1994543234,"Human apolipoprotein E, a blood plasma protein, mediates the transport and uptake of cholesterol and lipid by way of its high affinity interaction with different cellular receptors, including the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. The three-dimensional structure of the LDL receptor-binding domain of apoE has been determined at 2.5 angstrom resolution by x-ray crystallography. The protein forms an unusually elongated (65 angstroms) four-helix bundle, with the helices apparently stabilized by a tightly packed hydrophobic core that includes leucine zipper-type interactions and by numerous salt bridges on the mostly charged surface. Basic amino acids important for LDL receptor binding are clustered into a surface patch on one long helix. This structure provides the basis for understanding the behavior of naturally occurring mutants that can lead to atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2047040065,"Mutants of the maternal posterior-group genes of Drosophila lack posterior body pattern elements and germ cells, both of which form through the action of determinants localized to the posterior pole of the oocyte. We report that transcripts of one of these genes, oskar, become localized to the posterior pole of oocytes shortly after the oocyte begins to differentiate visibly. Analysis of various posterior-group mutants reveals that localization of oskar mRNA is an early step in the posterior localization pathway. In addition, we find that nonsense oskar mutations disrupt osk mRNA localization, while missense oskar mutations do not."
https://openalex.org/W2061928804,"Steroids may rapidly alter neuronal function and behavior through poorly characterized, direct actions on neuronal membranes. The membrane-bound receptors mediating these behavioral responses have not been identified. [3H]Corticosterone labels a population of specific, high-affinity recognition sites (dissociation constant = 0.51 nanomolar) in synaptic membranes from an amphibian brain. These binding sites were localized by receptor autoradiography in the neuropil, outside the regions of perikarya. The affinities of corticoids for this [3H]corticosterone binding site were linearly related to their potencies in rapidly suppressing male reproductive behavior. Thus, it appears that brain membranes contain a corticosteroid receptor that could participate in the regulation of behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2068702557,"Yeast cells choose bud sites on their surface in two distinct spatial patterns: axial for a and alpha cells and bipolar for a/alpha cells. We have identified four genes, BUD1-BUD4, necessary for the axial pattern by isolating mutants of alpha cells that do not exhibit this pattern. Mutations in BUD1 (which is the same as the previously identified gene RSR1) or BUD2 lead to a random budding pattern in all cell types; mutations in BUD3 or BUD4 lead to a bipolar pattern in all cell types. These observations indicate the existence of a basal budding pattern, requiring no BUD products, that is random; BUD1 and BUD2 act on this basal pattern to create the bipolar pattern; the further action of BUD3 and BUD4 leads to the axial pattern. These studies thus identify a set of gene products that directs cell morphogenesis to a genetically programmed site."
https://openalex.org/W2058860422,"The c-abl gene, originally identified as the cellular homolog of the transforming gene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase of unknown function that is expressed in all mammalian tissues. We have previously described the introduction of a mutation in the c-abl gene into the mouse germline via targeted gene disruption of embryonic stem cells. We now show that mice homozygous for this mutation are severely affected, displaying increased perinatal mortality, runtedness, and abnormal spleen, head, and eye development. We have examined components of the immune system and have found major reductions in B cell progenitors in the adult bone marrow, with less dramatic reductions in developing T cell compartments."

https://openalex.org/W1982584353,"The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor is normally delivered from the Golgi to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells and then transports polymeric IgA and IgM to the apical surface. We now report that a 14 residue segment of the 103 amino acid cytoplasmic domain, proximal to the plasma membrane, directs the receptor to the basolateral surface. A mutant receptor lacking these 14 amino acids is sorted directly to the apical surface from the Golgi. Furthermore, this sequence is sufficient to redirect an apical membrane protein, placental alkaline phosphatase, to the basolateral plasma membrane. We conclude that this sequence contains an autonomous signal, which specifies sorting from the Golgi to the basolateral surface, a process previously postulated to occur by default."

https://openalex.org/W2014199542,"There has been considerable uncertainty in estimates of past and current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rates in the United States. Statistical estimates of historical infection rates can be obtained from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) incidence data and the incubation period. However, this approach is subject to a number of sources of uncertainty and two other approaches, epidemic models of HIV transmission and surveys of HIV prevalence, are used to corroborate and refine the statistical estimates. Analyses suggest the HIV infection rate in the United States grew rapidly in the early 1980s, peaked in the mid-1980s, and subsequently declined markedly. Due both to the decline in the underlying infection rate and to the development of effective therapies that may delay AIDS diagnosis, overall AIDS incidence may plateau during the next 5 years. However, the number of individuals with advanced HIV disease without a diagnosis of AIDS who could potentially benefit from therapy is expected to increase 40% by 1995 as infected individuals progress to more advanced stages of HIV disease. Thus, although the overall HIV infection rate has declined, the demands on the U.S. health care system for treatment and care of HIV-infected individuals remain enormous."
https://openalex.org/W2042612037,"Neural maps of visual and auditory space are aligned in the adult optic tectum. In barn owls, this alignment of sensory maps was found to be controlled during ontogeny by visual instruction of the auditory spatial tuning of neurons. Large adaptive changes in auditory spatial tuning were induced by raising owls with displacing prisms mounted in spectacle frames in front of the eyes; neurons became tuned to sound source locations corresponding to their optically displaced, rather than their normal, visual receptive field locations. The results demonstrate that visual experience during development calibrates the tectal auditory space map in a site-specific manner, dictating its topography and alignment with the visual space map."

https://openalex.org/W2013200053,"The structure of yeast RNA polymerase II has been determined by three-dimensional reconstruction from electron micrographs of two-dimensional crystals at approximately 16 A resolution. The most prominent feature of the structure is an arm of protein density surrounding a channel about 25 A in diameter, similar to that found previously for E. coli RNA polymerase. The 25 A-diameter channel bifurcates on one face of the protein, connecting with a 25 A-wide groove and with a channel about half as wide. The 25 A channel and groove, and the narrow channel, may bind double- and single-stranded nucleic acids, respectively. A finger of protein density projecting from the molecule adjacent to the arm-like feature may represent the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit. These results provide a structural basis for analyses of the transcription process and its regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2055681276,"The β-tropomyosin gene in chicken contains two mutually exclusive exons (exons 6A and 6B) which are used by the splicing apparatus in myogenic cells, respectively, before (myoblast stage) and after (myotube stage) differentiation. The myoblast splicing pattern is shown to depend on multiple sequence elements that are located in the upstream intron and in the exon 6B and that exert a negative control over exon 6B splicing. This regulation of splicing is due, at least in part, to a secondary structure of the primary transcript, which limits in vivo the accessibility of exon 6B in myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2074745312,"Prolactin (PRL) is necessary for the proliferation of cloned T lymphocytes in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2). Translocation of PRL into the nucleus occurs during IL-2--stimulated mitogenesis. Therefore, the function of intranuclear PRL in T cell proliferation was tested. Eukaryotic expression vectors were prepared to express wild-type PRL [PRL(WT)], PRL that lacks the signal sequence for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum [PRL(ER-)], and chimeric PRL in which the signal peptide was replaced with the sequence that directs the nuclear translocation of the SV40 large T antigen [PRL(NT+)]. Expression of these constructs in a T cell line (Nb2) responsive to PRL and IL-2 resulted in localization of PRL in the extracellular milieu, cytoplasm, or nucleus, respectively. Stimulation with IL-2 alone resulted in a five- to tenfold increase in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by cells expressing PRL(NT+) or PRL(WT) as compared to PRL(ER-) or the parental Nb2 cells. Only the PRL(NT+) clone proliferated continuously with IL-2 stimulation in the presence of antiserum to PRL. These results demonstrate that nuclear PRL is necessary for IL-2--stimulated proliferation and suggest that a peptide hormone can function in the nucleus without binding to its cell surface receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2036369813,"The chicken beta-tropomyosin pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is spliced in a tissue-specific manner to yield messenger RNA's (mRNA's) coding for different isoforms of this protein. Exons 6A and 6B are spliced in a mutually exclusive manner; exon 6B was included in skeletal muscle, whereas exon 6A was preferred in all other tissues. The distal portion of the intron upstream of exon 6B was shown to form stable double-stranded regions with part of the intron downstream of exon 6B and with sequences in exon 6B. This structure repressed splicing of exon 6B to exon 7 in a HeLa cell extract. Derepression of splicing occurred on disruption of this structure and repression followed when the structure was re-formed, even if the structure was formed between two different RNA molecules. Repression leads to inhibition of formation of spliceosomes. Disrupting either of the two double-stranded regions could lead to derepression, whereas re-forming the helices by suppressor mutations reestablished repression. These results support a simple model of tissue-specific splicing in this region of the pre-mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2114452310,"Egr-1 is an early growth response gene that encodes a protein with three zinc fingers and is involved in transcriptional regulation. In adult heart myocytes, in contrast to c-fos and c-myc, high levels of Egr-1 mRNA expression have been shown. Here we report that Egr-1 transactivates rat cardiac alpha-MHC gene expression. In serum-starved primary cultures of 18-day-old fetal rat heart myocytes, addition of serum evoked expression of both Egr-1 and alpha-MHC gene transcripts. Inclusion of 10 microM cycloheximide in these cultures for 48 h caused a greater increase in Egr-1 mRNA, whereas the expression of alpha-MHC transcripts was ablated. To examine the involvement of Egr-1 in alpha-MHC induction, we transfected primary cultures of cardiac myocytes with plasmids pCMVEgr-1 (Egr-1 expression vector) and pMP3.3CAT containing -2.9- to +0.42-kilobase sequences of the alpha-MHC gene fused to the coding region of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Cotransfection of pCMVEgr-1 stimulated expression of pMP3.3CAT 10-15-fold. Furthermore, pCMVEgr-1 also stimulated expression of the endogenous alpha-MHC gene in primary cultures of cardiac myocytes. Transactivation of pMP3.3CAT expression by pCMVEgr-1 was also observed by transfecting the myogenic cell line Sol 8, but not in L6E9 cells or in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. By creating progressive 5' deletions of the alpha-MHC gene, we found that the region extending between -1698 and -1283 base pairs is necessary for Egr-1-induced expression of the alpha-MHC/CAT construct. These results define a physiological target for the Egr-1 transcription factor and delineate a novel mechanism for regulation of the alpha-MHC gene."
https://openalex.org/W1858039675,"Increasing evidence suggests that the formation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) in vivo is associated with the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease. We investigated the effects of Ox-LDL on two vascular endothelial cell coagulant properties, tissue factor expression, and protein C activation. The Ox-LDL increased human arterial and venous endothelial cell tissue factor activity, with 100 micrograms/ml of Ox-LDL increasing factor activity fourfold. Native LDL modified by incubation with cultured human arterial and venous endothelial cells also induced endothelial cell tissue factor activity. This modification was blocked by coincubation with the antioxidants, probucol or ascorbic acid. It was determined, based on inhibition by known scavenger receptor antagonists (fucoidin, dextran sulfate), that binding of Ox-LDL via the acetyl LDL (scavenger) receptor was partially responsible for the increase in tissue factor expression. Whereas endothelial cell tissue factor expression was increased by incubation with Ox-LDL, protein C activation was reduced approximately 80% by incubating cultured endothelial cells with Ox-LDL. The effect of Ox-LDL on protein C activation was not inhibited by antagonists to the scavenger receptor. These data indicating that an atherogenic lipoprotein can regulate key vascular coagulant activities provide an additional link between vascular disease and thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2083778255,"The highly leukemogenic avian retrovirus E26 expresses the two transcriptional activator-type oncogenes v-myb and v-ets as a nuclear fusion protein. Previous studies have shown that both oncogenes cooperate in the transformation of erythroid cells in vitro and that the phenotypes of transformed cells differ, depending on whether the oncogenes are coexpressed as separate proteins or as a fusion protein. Here we show that virus constructs encoding either v-Myb or v-Ets as their only oncoprotein are nonleukemogenic and that constructs coexpressing nonfused v-Myb and v-Ets proteins appear to be weakly leukemogenic. Surprisingly, leukemic animals injected with the latter contain highly leukemogenic variant viruses that exhibit internal deletions in their genome, resulting in the synthesis of novel Myb-Ets fusion proteins. These results show that v-Myb and v-Ets must be fused to cause leukemia and establish a new mechanism of oncogene activation and cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2156105649,"A C to U substitution at position 1469 of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from Escherichia coli suppresses streptomycin dependence and causes increased translational error frequencies. Strains containing the rpsL252 or StrM287 streptomycin-dependent alleles are able to grow in the absence of streptomycin when transformed with plasmids containing the U1469 mutation in 16S rRNA. Ribosomes containing wild-type proteins and U1469 mutant 16S rRNA misincorporate leucine in vitro at elevated levels, comparable to that of some typical S4 ram ribosomes. These results provide additional support for the participation of 16S rRNA in maintaining translational accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W1506326843,"Involvement of acidic cell compartments in processing and action of cholera toxin (CT) in rat liver has been examined using subcellular fractionation. Liver cell fractions prepared various times after CT injection display, after a lag phase, a progressive increase in adenylate cyclase activity, detectable earlier in Golgi-endosomal fractions (20 min) than in plasma membrane fractions (30 min), with a maximum (3-fold basal activity) achieved by 60-90 min. Endosomes containing in vivo internalized CT display a time-dependent increase in their ability to bind anti-A-subunit antibodies and to stimulate exogenous adenylate cyclase, which kinetically parallels the generation of A1 peptide, suggesting a translocation of A-subunit (or A1 peptide) across the endosomal membrane. In vivo chloroquine treatment inhibits endocytosis of CT taken up into the liver, lengthens the lag phase for adenylate cyclase activation by CT, and reduces by 3- to 10-fold the apparent affinity of the toxin for the enzyme. Incubation of endosomes containing internalized toxin at 37 degrees C under isotonic conditions results in a pH-dependent increase in generation of A1 peptide, membrane translocation of A-subunit (or A1 peptide), and degradation of toxin, with a maximum at pH 5. Addition of ATP, by decreasing the internal endosomal pH, stimulates both generation of the A1 peptide and degradation of toxin at pH 6-8. It is concluded that activation of adenylate cyclase by CT in intact liver requires association and subsequent processing of toxin in an acidic cell compartment, presumably endosomal."
https://openalex.org/W1492816687,"Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor that plays a critical role in the normal development of the anterior pituitary gland. Previous analyses have shown that this protein exists in the rat pituitary gland and in rat pituitary-derived cell lines as two forms of relative molecular mass 33 and 31 kDa. This aspect of Pit-1 expression has been conserved throughout the evolution from rodents to humans. Here, we determine the origin of these structurally distinct forms of Pit-1 protein and find that these arise as a consequence of the alternative usage of translation initiation sites present in Pit-1 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2067459682,"The anthranilate synthase-phosphoribosyl transferase complex of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway in Salmonella typhimurium is an allosteric, heterotetrameric (TrpE2-TrpD2) enzyme whose multiple activities are negatively feedback-regulated by L-tryptophan. A hybrid complex containing one catalytically active, feedback-insensitive and one catalytically inactive, feedback-sensitive mutant TrpE subunit was assembled in vitro and used to investigate communication between regulatory and catalytic sites located on different subunits. The properties of the hybrid complex demonstrate that the binding of a single inhibitor molecule to one TrpE subunit is sufficient for the propagation of a conformational change that affects the active site of the companion subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1932081519,"Protection from cytosine arabinoside-induced alopecia by ImuVert has recently been reported in a rat model. ImuVert, a biologic response modifier, is capable of activating mononuclear cells causing release of various cytokines. In the present study, using the young rat model, recombinant human IL 1 beta produced excellent protection from cytosine arabinoside-induced alopecia. Mouse recombinant tumor necrosis factor gave definite but modest protection whereas human tumor necrosis factor gave none. It is concluded that the protection from alopecia by ImuVert is mediated by cytokines, primarily IL 1."
https://openalex.org/W1540300629,"We have previously shown that vitamin A deficiency severely impairs the young rat's ability to produce specific antibodies after primary immunization with tetanus toxoid (TT). In the present studies, we asked whether immunologic memory to TT is established even in the vitamin A-depleted animal, and if so, whether such memory can be elicited after subsequent repletion with retinol. Vitamin A-depleted rats produced very low concentrations of TT-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in both the primary and secondary responses; however, the ratios of secondary to primary IgM anti-TT and of IgG anti-TT were normal. When rats were repleted with retinol 1 day after immunization, IgM and IgG anti-TT concentrations in both the primary and secondary responses were at least as great as those of control rats. For rats repleted with retinol 2 days before the booster immunization, secondary IgM and IgG anti-TT concentrations were equal in magnitude to those of vitamin A-sufficient controls. For all groups, the kinetics of the antibody response were similar. We conclude that immunological memory is intact in the vitamin A-depleted animal, as shown by 1) the normal ratio of its secondary to primary antibody responses, 2) the restoration of a quantitatively normal secondary antibody response in previously vitamin A-depleted animals repleted with retinol just before boosting with TT, and 3) a normal class switch from IgM to IgG. Retinol deficiency is also characterized by an abnormal elevation of total plasma IgG, despite the inability of the vitamin A-depleted animal to produce normal quantities of specific antibodies after challenge with antigen.—Kinoshita, M.; Pasatiempo, A.

https://openalex.org/W1589921157,"Serum amyloid P component (SAP) forms a calcium-dependent complex with C4b-binding protein (C4BP) in human serum. this study demonstrated that heparin interacted with SAP in a calcium-dependent manner and prevented formation of the SAP.C4BP complex. Furthermore, the SAP-heparin interaction interfered with SAP binding to membranes. Therefore, all three of these interactions involved similar sites on SAP, or each interaction sterically obstructed the other binding sites. In addition to heparin, SAP bound to heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. In each case, a distinct multimeric species was generated. Gel filtration and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation suggested that heparin and heparan sulfate produced a dimer of SAP. The dimer appeared to be the most stable structure since it was not dissociated by excess heparin. While low molecular weight heparin interacted with SAP and inhibited SAP association with membranes, the SAP dimer was not detected in sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation studies. Polybrene prevented the interaction between SAP and heparin in both a purified system and in human serum that was enriched in SAP and heparin. In contrast, Polybrene did not seem to alter the SAP.C4BP complex. While the function of the SAP.C4BP complex is unknown, it may be important for regulation of complement and/or transport of SAP to sites in the body. Dissociation of the SAP.C4BP complex by sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin may be a physiological response that could be important during tissue damage or complement activation."
https://openalex.org/W1810386690,"The effect of biotin on the induction (and possible requirement for uptake into mitochondria) of apopyruvate carboxylase has been examined in 3T3-L adipocytes. Cells fed biotin-sufficient medium contained only holoenzyme in mitochrondria and no apoenzyme was detected. The amount of apoenzyme elaborated in biotin-deficient 3T3-L adipocytes was comparable to the holopyruvate carboxylase protein found in cells maintained on biotin-sufficient medium. Like the holoenzyme, the apoenzyme was detected exclusively in the mitochondrial fraction of 3T3-L adipocytes. This indicates that the synthesis of apopyruvate carboxylase and its translocation into mitochondria occur independently of the cofactor, biotin.—Ahmad, P. M.; Ahmad, F.

https://openalex.org/W1567562306,"We have previously demonstrated that a synthetic gene encoding Cerebratulus lacteus neurotoxin B-IV can be expressed in bacteria, and the recombinant toxin purified and refolded (Howell, M. L., and Blumenthal, K. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15268-15273). This toxin, which contains an NH2-terminal methionine residue not present in authentic B-IV, has a specific toxicity 35-40% that of the naturally occurring form. Deletion of the codon for the NH2-terminal methionine allows expression of fully active recombinant B-IV, demonstrating that hydroxylation of Pro-10 is not important for biological activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of the des-Met(-1) form has been employed to analyze the contribution of NH2-terminal sequences of this toxin to its activity. We have emphasized replacement of helix-favoring residues by helix-destabilizing ones which are otherwise sterically similar. When Ala-3 or Ala-8 is replaced by serine, little or no effect on specific toxicity is observed. However, the double mutant in which both alanines are substituted with serine is more than twice as active as natural B-IV, although the secondary structures and conformational stabilities of the wild-type and mutant forms are the same. When Ala-3 and 8 are simultaneously replaced with glycine, the resulting toxin displays an activity similar to that of the wild-type form. The conformational properties of this mutant are unchanged from that of either wild-type or the serine double mutant. These data indicate that insertion into the NH2-terminal region of toxin B-IV of residues which can participate in hydrogen bond formation enhances biological activity of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1496368459,"It was recently shown that a 25-residue peptide, Dk-(61-85), derived from the alpha 1 domain of a murine major histocompatibility class I molecule (H-2Dk), affects insulin receptor functions (Hansen, T., Stagsted, J., Pedersen, L., Roth, R. A., Goldstein, A., and Olsson, L. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 3123-3126; Stagsted, J., Reaven, G. M., Hansen, T., Goldstein, A., and Olsson, L. (1990) Cell 62, 297-307). We now report that this peptide can reversibly assume a biologically active or inactive state as measured in the rat adipocyte glucose uptake assay, implying that the peptide has at least two interconvertible conformations. The peptide has an ordered conformation in 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaCl stock solution as shown by circular dichroism, but has a disordered molecular structure and is inactive when dissolved in H2O. The biologically active peptide forms liquid crystals at the stock solution concentration (1 mM), so the CD spectra do not provide information on the secondary structure. Under all conditions tested, biological activity (measured after transfer to assay buffer) is associated with an ordered conformation in stock solution. Biological activity and an ordered conformation of the peptide in H2O stock solution can be induced by increasing ionic strength (greater than 100 mM NaCl for maximal effect) or increasing pH (greater than 5 for maximal effect). The induction rate of the ordered conformation is slow with a half-maximal value obtained after approximately 20 min. Both biological activity and the ordered structure are lost upon heating of stock solution to 90 degrees C or upon transfer to assay buffer. A similar correlation of ordered structure with biological activity was observed with two truncated peptides derived from Dk-(61-85). It is inferred from these results that the Dk-(61-85) peptide and related peptides only affect insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in rat adipocytes if they have assumed an ordered conformation in stock solution prior to transfer to assay buffer and exposure to cells."
