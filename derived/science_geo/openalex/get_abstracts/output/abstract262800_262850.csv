https://openalex.org/W2092904442,"At interfaces between complex oxides, electronic systems with unusual electronic properties can be generated. We report on superconductivity in the electron gas formed at the interface between two insulating dielectric perovskite oxides, LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3 . The behavior of the electron gas is that of a two-dimensional superconductor, confined to a thin sheet at the interface. The superconducting transition temperature of ≅ 200 millikelvin provides a strict upper limit to the thickness of the superconducting layer of ≅ 10 nanometers."
https://openalex.org/W1985502949,"The cellular immune response to tissue damage and infection requires the recruitment of blood leukocytes. This process is mediated through a classical multistep mechanism, which involves transient rolling on the endothelium and recognition of inflammation followed by extravasation. We have shown, by direct examination of blood monocyte functions in vivo, that a subset of monocytes patrols healthy tissues through long-range crawling on the resting endothelium. This patrolling behavior depended on the integrin LFA-1 and the chemokine receptor CX 3 CR1 and was required for rapid tissue invasion at the site of an infection by this “resident” monocyte population, which initiated an early immune response and differentiated into macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2091119718,"A detailed depiction of the 'integrin adhesome', consisting of a complex network of 156 components linked together and modified by 690 interactions is presented. Different views of the network reveal several functional 'subnets' that are involved in switching on or off many of the molecular interactions within the network, consequently affecting cell adhesion, migration and cytoskeletal organization. Examination of the adhesome network motifs reveals a relatively small number of key motifs, dominated by three-component complexes in which a scaffolding molecule recruits both a signalling molecule and its downstream target. We discuss the role of the different network modules in regulating the structural and signalling functions of cell-matrix adhesions."
https://openalex.org/W2095849709,"Block copolymers consist of two or more chemically different polymers connected by covalent linkages. In solution, repulsion between the blocks leads to a variety of morphologies, which are thermodynamically driven. Polyferrocenyldimethylsilane block copolymers show an unusual propensity to forming cylindrical micelles in solution. We found that the micelle structure grows epitaxially through the addition of more polymer, producing micelles with a narrow size dispersity, in a process analogous to the growth of living polymer. By adding a different block copolymer, we could form co-micelles. We were also able to selectively functionalize different parts of the micelle. Potential applications for these materials include their use in lithographic etch resists, in redox-active templates, and as catalytically active metal nanoparticle precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1995232839,"Block copolymers consist of two or more chemically different polymer segments, or blocks, connected by a covalent linkage. In solution, amphiphilic blocks can self-assemble as a result of energetic repulsion effects between blocks. The degree of repulsion, the lengths of the block segments, and the selectivity of the solvent primarily control the resultant assembled morphology. In an ideal situation, one would like to be able to alter the morphology that forms without having to change the chemistry of the block copolymer. Through the kinetic manipulation of charged, amphiphilic block copolymers in solution, we are able to generate different nanoscale structures with simple block copolymer chemistry. The technique relies on divalent organic counter ions and solvent mixtures to drive the organization of the block copolymers down specific pathways into complex one-dimensional structures. Block copolymers are increasingly used as templating materials; thus, the ability to control the formation of specific patterns and structures is of growing interest and applicability."

https://openalex.org/W2016371780,"Recently, we identified recurrent gene fusions involving the 5' untranslated region of the androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2 and the ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family genes ERG, ETV1 or ETV4 in most prostate cancers. Whereas TMPRSS2-ERG fusions are predominant, fewer TMPRSS2-ETV1 cases have been identified than expected on the basis of the frequency of high (outlier) expression of ETV1 (refs 3-13). Here we explore the mechanism of ETV1 outlier expression in human prostate tumours and prostate cancer cell lines. We identified previously unknown 5' fusion partners in prostate tumours with ETV1 outlier expression, including untranslated regions from a prostate-specific androgen-induced gene (SLC45A3) and an endogenous retroviral element (HERV-K_22q11.23), a prostate-specific androgen-repressed gene (C15orf21), and a strongly expressed housekeeping gene (HNRPA2B1). To study aberrant activation of ETV1, we identified two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and MDA-PCa 2B, that had ETV1 outlier expression. Through distinct mechanisms, the entire ETV1 locus (7p21) is rearranged to a 1.5-megabase prostate-specific region at 14q13.3-14q21.1 in both LNCaP cells (cryptic insertion) and MDA-PCa 2B cells (balanced translocation). Because the common factor of these rearrangements is aberrant ETV1 overexpression, we recapitulated this event in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that ETV1 overexpression in benign prostate cells and in the mouse prostate confers neoplastic phenotypes. Identification of distinct classes of ETS gene rearrangements demonstrates that dormant oncogenes can be activated in prostate cancer by juxtaposition to tissue-specific or ubiquitously active genomic loci. Subversion of active genomic regulatory elements may serve as a more generalized mechanism for carcinoma development. Furthermore, the identification of androgen-repressed and insensitive 5' fusion partners may have implications for the anti-androgen treatment of advanced prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1997332543,"In flowering plants, signaling between the male pollen tube and the synergid cells of the female gametophyte is required for fertilization. In the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant feronia ( fer ), fertilization is impaired; the pollen tube fails to arrest and thus continues to grow inside the female gametophyte. FER encodes a synergid-expressed, plasma membrane–localized receptor-like kinase. We found that the FER protein accumulates asymmetrically in the synergid membrane at the filiform apparatus. Interspecific crosses using pollen from Arabidopsis lyrata and Cardamine flexuosa on A. thaliana stigmas resulted in a fer -like phenotype that correlates with sequence divergence in the extracellular domain of FER. Our findings show that the female control of pollen tube reception is based on a FER -dependent signaling pathway, which may play a role in reproductive isolation barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2112643649,"Background Refined sugars (e.g., sucrose, fructose) were absent in the diet of most people until very recently in human history. Today overconsumption of diets rich in sugars contributes together with other factors to drive the current obesity epidemic. Overconsumption of sugar-dense foods or beverages is initially motivated by the pleasure of sweet taste and is often compared to drug addiction. Though there are many biological commonalities between sweetened diets and drugs of abuse, the addictive potential of the former relative to the latter is currently unknown. Methodology/Principal findings Here we report that when rats were allowed to choose mutually-exclusively between water sweetened with saccharin–an intense calorie-free sweetener–and intravenous cocaine–a highly addictive and harmful substance–the large majority of animals (94%) preferred the sweet taste of saccharin. The preference for saccharin was not attributable to its unnatural ability to induce sweetness without calories because the same preference was also observed with sucrose, a natural sugar. Finally, the preference for saccharin was not surmountable by increasing doses of cocaine and was observed despite either cocaine intoxication, sensitization or intake escalation–the latter being a hallmark of drug addiction. Conclusions Our findings clearly demonstrate that intense sweetness can surpass cocaine reward, even in drug-sensitized and -addicted individuals. We speculate that the addictive potential of intense sweetness results from an inborn hypersensitivity to sweet tastants. In most mammals, including rats and humans, sweet receptors evolved in ancestral environments poor in sugars and are thus not adapted to high concentrations of sweet tastants. The supranormal stimulation of these receptors by sugar-rich diets, such as those now widely available in modern societies, would generate a supranormal reward signal in the brain, with the potential to override self-control mechanisms and thus to lead to addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2068220247,"A freely floating polymer film, tens of nanometers in thickness, wrinkles under the capillary force exerted by a drop of water placed on its surface. The wrinkling pattern is characterized by the number and length of the wrinkles. The dependence of the number of wrinkles on the elastic properties of the film and on the capillary force exerted by the drop confirms recent theoretical predictions on the selection of a pattern with a well-defined length scale in the wrinkling instability. We combined scaling relations that were developed for the length of the wrinkles with those for the number of wrinkles to construct a metrology for measuring the elasticity and thickness of ultrathin films that relies on no more than a dish of fluid and a low-magnification microscope. We validated this method on polymer films modified by plasticizer. The relaxation of the wrinkles affords a simple method to study the viscoelastic response of ultrathin films."

https://openalex.org/W2137825287,"To identify cytoskeletal proteins that change conformation or assembly within stressed cells, in situ labeling of sterically shielded cysteines with fluorophores was analyzed by fluorescence imaging, quantitative mass spectrometry, and sequential two-dye labeling. Within red blood cells, shotgun labeling showed that shielded cysteines in the two isoforms of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin were increasingly labeled as a function of shear stress and time, indicative of forced unfolding of specific domains. Within mesenchymal stem cells-as a prototypical adherent cell-nonmuscle myosin IIA and vimentin are just two of the cytoskeletal proteins identified that show differential labeling in tensed versus drug-relaxed cells. Cysteine labeling of proteins within live cells can thus be used to fluorescently map out sites of molecular-scale deformation, and the results also suggest means to colocalize signaling events such as phosphorylation with forced unfolding."

In a quantitative proteomic study, we identified 86 proteins that were more or less abundant in long-lived daf-2 mutant worms than in wild-type worms. Genetic studies on a subset of these proteins indicated that they act in one or more processes regulated by DAF-2, including entry into the dauer developmental stage and aging. In particular, we discovered a compensatory mechanism activated in response to reduced DAF-2 signaling, which involves the protein phosphatase calcineurin."
https://openalex.org/W2033732585,"A paradigm shift is occurring in the field of primary immunodeficiencies, with revision of the definition of these conditions and a considerable expansion of their limits. Inborn errors of immunity were initially thought to be confined to a few rare, familial, monogenic, recessive traits impairing the development or function of one or several leukocyte subsets and resulting in multiple, recurrent, opportunistic, and fatal infections in infancy. A growing number of exceptions to each of these conventional qualifications have gradually accumulated. It now appears that most individuals suffer from at least one of a multitude of primary immunodeficiencies, the dissection of which is helping to improve human medicine while describing immunity in natura."
https://openalex.org/W2120735114,"BtuCD is an adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter that translocates vitamin B 12 from the periplasmic binding protein BtuF into the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. The 2.6 angstrom crystal structure of a complex BtuCD-F reveals substantial conformational changes as compared with the previously reported structures of BtuCD and BtuF. The lobes of BtuF are spread apart, and B 12 is displaced from the binding pocket. The transmembrane BtuC subunits reveal two distinct conformations, and the translocation pathway is closed to both sides of the membrane. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of spin-labeled cysteine mutants reconstituted in proteoliposomes are consistent with the conformation of BtuCD-F that was observed in the crystal structure. A comparison with BtuCD and the homologous HI1470/71 protein suggests that the structure of BtuCD-F may reflect a posttranslocation intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2001911522,"The chemokines CCL21 and CXCL13 are immune factors that dictate homing and motility of lymphocytes and dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues. However, the means by which these chemokines are regulated and how they influence cell trafficking during immune responses remain unclear. We show that CCL21 and CXCL13 are transiently down-regulated within lymphoid tissues during immune responses by a mechanism controlled by the cytokine interferon-γ. This modulation was found to alter the localization of lymphocytes and dendritic cells within responding lymphoid tissues. As a consequence, priming of T cell responses to a second distinct pathogen after chemokine modulation became impaired. We propose that this transient chemokine modulation may help orchestrate local cellularity, thus minimizing competition for space and resources in activated lymphoid tissues."

The challenge ahead for immunologists is the further elucidation of the molecular and cellular processes that govern the development and function of these cells. From this, exciting possibilities are emerging for the manipulation of regulatory T cell pathways in treating immunological diseases and suppressing or augmenting physiological immune responses."

It is the major physiologic substrate for the enzyme glyoxalase I, which is encoded by the GLOI gene. Together with glyoxalase II and a catalytic amount of glutathione, glyoxalase I reduces methylglyoxal to d-lactate (3Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells, methylglyoxal reacts almost exclusively with arginine residues to form the major methylglyoxal-derived epitope hydroimidazolone MG-H1 (Nα-acetyl-Nδ (5-hydro-5-methyl)-4-imidazolone) (4Ahmed N. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in methylglyoxal concentration have been implicated in the pathobiology of a variety of important diseases, including diabetic vascular disease. Diabetes increases levels of the methylglyoxal arginine-derived hydroimidazolone adduct MG-H1 in retina, renal glomerulus, and sciatic nerve of rats (5Hammes H.P. Du X. Edelstein D. Taguchi T.

Zsengeller Z. Szabo C. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Diabetes also induces a significant increase in retinal and glomerular expression of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in rats (8Hammes H.P. Lin J. Wagner P. Feng Y. Vom Hagen F. Krzizok T. Renner O. Breier G.

In diabetic retinal capillaries, increased Ang-2 is associated with pericyte loss and acellular capillary formation, while in kidney it is associated with glomerular capillary loss in anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis (9Yuan H.T. Tipping P.G. Li X.Z. Long D.A. Woolf A.S. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 2078-2089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A mechanistic link between elevated angiopoietin-2 levels and vascular pathology is suggested by the finding that Ang-2 can function as an autocrine regulator of endothelial inflammatory responses (12Fiedler U. Reiss Y. Scharpfenecker M. Grunow V. Koidl S. Thurston G. Gale N.W. Witzenrath M. Rosseau S. Suttorp N. Sobke A. Herrmann M. Preissner K.T. Vajkoczy P. Augustin H.G. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize that hyperglycemia-induced methylglyoxal formation might directly regulate transcription of genes involved in diabetic vascular disease, such as Ang-2, by covalently modifying proteins that bind to the Ang-2 promoter. In the present study, we demonstrate that in mouse kidney microvascular endothelial cells increased glycolytic flux causes increased methylglyoxal modification of the corepressor mSin3A. Methylglyoxal modification of mSin3A results in increased recruitment of O-GlcNAc-transferase to an mSin3A-Sp3 complex, with consequent increased modification of Sp3 by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine. This modification of Sp3 causes decreased binding of the repressor complex to a glucose-responsive GC-box in the Ang-2 promoter, resulting in increased Ang-2 expression. High glucose-induced Ang-2 increased expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) both in cultured cells and in diabetic mice and sensitized microvascular endothelial cells to the proinflammatory effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). This novel mechanism for regulating gene expression may play a role in the pathobiology of diabetic vascular disease.

Reverse Transcription Reaction and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA from treated cells was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and the RNA was reverse transcribed by SuperScript™ III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was run on a Light-Cycler Roche 480 (Roche Molecular Systems) with the Light-Cycler Roche 480 master kit.

In Vivo Mice Experiments—Chronic diabetic mice were induced by consecutive injection of 50 mg/kg streptozotocin (0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5) for 5 days after an 8-h fasting. Animals with blood glucose >300 mg/dl are considered positive. Control mice received only vehicle injection. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation prior to experiments. The kidney or other tissues were collected for further analysis of mRNA and protein level or the MG modification. All in vivo procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistics—Results are given as mean ± S.E. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Data distribution was analyzed, and statistical differences for different treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer test using SPSS 15 software. Ang-2 Transcription Is Induced by High Glucose—Because incubation in high glucose increases intracellular glucose flux and methylglyoxal concentration in cells damaged by hyperglycemia (15Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (6864) Google Scholar), we first examined the effects of incubating MKEC cells in 30 mm glucose. This treatment increased Ang-2 mRNA levels more than 2.7-fold compared with 5 mm glucose (Fig. 1A) and increased Ang-2 protein levels by 2.2-fold (Fig. 1B). Incubation in 30 mm mannitol, an osmotic control, did not (data not shown). Because overproduction of superoxide by mitochondria is the major mechanism by which high glucose increases intracellular levels of the glyoxalase I substrate methylglyoxal (15Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (6864) Google Scholar), we also evaluated the effect of overexpressing either uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), a specific protein uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation capable of collapsing the proton electrochemical gradient, or manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), the mitochondrial form of this antioxidant enzyme. Each of these completely prevented the high glucose-induced increase of Ang-2 mRNA and protein. (Fig. 1, A and B). Overexpression of GLO1, like UCP-1 and SOD2, completely prevented the high glucose-induced increase of Ang-2 mRNA and protein in MKECs. Identification of a Glucose-responsive Element in the Ang-2 Promoter—To localize the regulatory elements required for transcriptional activation of the Ang-2 gene by high glucose, progressive 5′-promoter deletion constructs were generated containing different portions of the murine Ang-2 promoter. In 5 mm glucose, the reporter activities were not markedly different among the -2239, -1921, -1221, -931, -677, -402, and -151 deletion constructs (numbered according to Ensembl Transcript ID: ENS-MUST00000033846). In 30 mm glucose, activities were increased ∼2.9-fold compared with those in 5 mm glucose in all constructs (data not shown). However, a significant decrease of activity was observed in the -52 construct compared with the -151 construct in 5 mm glucose, and activity was not increased by high glucose. These data indicated that promoter elements between -151 and -52 are responsible for high glucose-induced transcriptional activation of the Ang-2 promoter. Comparison of these sequences with transcription factor databases (TFSEARCH) revealed two c-Ets sites (positions -131 and -102), an AP-1 site (-111), an AP-2 site (-82), and an Sp1 site (-77) (Fig. 1C). We next explored the possible involvement of these motifs on the high glucose-induced increase in transcriptional activity of the Ang-2 promoter using a series of mutated or deleted Ang-2 luciferase constructs. As shown in Fig. 1C, deletion of the distal c-Ets (position -131) did not decrease high glucose-induced transcriptional activation. Similarly, mutation of the AP-1 site (construct -112 + AP-1 mut), the proximal c-Ets site (position -102), or deletion of sequence upstream of nucleotide -95 (construct -95) also had no effect. In contrast, mutation of the GC-rich sequences between the AP-2 and Sp1 site (-112 + GC mut and -102 + GC mut) and deletion of sequence upstream of nucleotide -52 both caused complete inhibition of high glucose-induced activation. These data indicated that the GC-rich sequence between the AP-2 and Sp1 sites is required for glucose responsiveness of the Ang-2 promoter. Sp3 and Sp1 Binding to the Ang-2 Promoter Changes in Response to High Glucose—To determine which of these nuclear proteins binds to the GC-box site and what the effects of high glucose and glyoxalase I overexpression are in the context of native chromatin structure, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed using antibodies specific for the indicated cognate proteins shown in Fig. 2. After immunoprecipitation and reversal of the cross-linking, the endogenous Ang-2 promoter was enriched by real-time PCR amplification using primers specific for the Ang-2 GC-box site. The PCR product from Sp1 immunoprecipitation was increased 3.1-fold by 30 mm glucose compared with 5 mm glucose, and this increase was prevented by overexpression of GLO1, as well as by overexpression of UCP-1 or SOD2 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the PCR product from Sp3 chromatin immunoprecipitation was decreased 54% in 30 mm glucose compared with 5 mm (Fig. 2B). This decrease was prevented by overexpression of GLO1, as well as by overexpression of UCP-1 or SOD2. AP-2α binding was not affected by high glucose (Fig. 2C). These data indicated that Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2α bind to the Ang-2 promoter in the context of its native chromatin structure and suggested that the observed changes in Sp1 and Sp3 binding induced by incubating cells in 30 mm glucose might mediate high glucose-induced Ang-2 expression. Sp3 Complexes with Methylglyoxal-modified Proteins, but Neither Sp3 nor Sp1 Is Modified by Methylglyoxal—Because GLO1 overexpression prevented high glucose-induced changes in Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the glucose-responsive element in the Ang-2 promoter (Fig. 2), we hypothesized that high glucose induced these changes by modifying either Sp1, Sp3, or both with methylglyoxal. Surprisingly, however, when Sp1 and Sp3 were immunoprecipitated and then immunoblotted with anti-MG, neither protein was modified by MG (data not shown). In contrast, when nuclear extracts from MKECs were immunoprecipitated with anti-MG antibody and immunoblotted for Sp1 and Sp3, high glucose increased the density of the Sp3 band and GLO1 overexpression prevented this increase. The high glucose-induced increase in Sp3 band density was also prevented by overexpression of UCP-1 and SOD2 (Fig. 3A). Neither high glucose nor GLO1 overexpression affected Sp1 band density. These results suggested that an Sp3-associated protein was modified by methylglyoxal, rather than Sp3 itself, and that this modification might alter Sp3 binding to the Ang-2 promoter. Methylglyoxal Modifies mSin3A, Which Increases Its Association with OGT—Because a variety of proteins have been reported to associate with Sp3, we performed IP Western blots for HDAC1/2, RbAp46/48, N-CoR, OGT (data not shown), and mSin3A. Only the corepressor mSin3A was modified by MG (Fig. 3, A and B). Cells incubated in high glucose had a 2.1-fold increase in MG modification of mSin3A. Overexpression of GLO1, as well as UCP-1 and SOD2, prevented this increase. mSin3A has been reported to recruit the enzyme OGT (16Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). When immunoprecipitated mSin3A was immunoblotted for OGT, cells incubated in high glucose had significantly more OGT associated with mSin3A (Fig. 3B). Overexpression of GLO1, as well as UCP-1 and SOD2, prevented this increase. This effect was confirmed by immunoprecipitating OGT and then immunoblotting for mSin3A (Fig. 3C). To determine which MG-modifiable residues in mSin3A were required for this increased binding of OGT, we first showed that the PAH4 domain of mSin3A was both necessary and sufficient for this methylglyoxal-responsive recruitment by subcloning different mSin3A domains (aa 1-189 (PAH1), aa 189-383 (PAH2), aa 383-526 (PAH3), aa 526-888 (HID), aa 888-955 (PAH4), and aa 955-1219 into the pVP16-AD-vector for mammalian two-hybrid assays with pm-DBD-OGT (1-286) (data not shown). These data are consistent with data reported by Yang et al. (16Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) showing that the PAH4 domain of mSin3A was necessary and sufficient for binding OGT. Although methylglyoxal reacts primarily with Arg residues in vivo, Lys and Cys residues in proteins can also be modified (17Van Herreweghe F. Mao J. Chaplen F.W. Grooten J. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Vancompernolle K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Chaplen F.W. Fahl W.E. Cameron D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the possible role of each Arg, Lys, and Cys residue in the PAH4 domain of mSin3A (Fig. 3D) by making point mutants in the PAH4 domain that converted each of the 14 residues to glutamine. Mammalian two-hybrid assays showed that overexpression of GLO1 completely prevented the increased association of mSin3A with OGT induced by high glucose (data not shown). Single mutations of Arg-923, Arg-925, and Lys-938 partly prevented the increased association of mSin3A and OGT, and double mutation of Arg-925 and Lys-938 completely prevented the increased association. Double mutation of Arg-923 and Arg-925 was no more effective than mutation of Arg-925 alone, and double mutation of Arg-923 and Lys-938 was slightly more effective than mutation of Lys-938 alone (data not shown). These results are consistent with receptor binding domain analysis from the PAH4 domain sequence data (data not shown) that identified 6 methylglyoxal-modifiable residues as potential sites critical for protein-protein interaction (Arg-916, Arg-923, Arg-925, Arg-936, Arg-947, and Lys-938). The effect of the double mutation on high glucose-induced modification of mSin3A by methylglyoxal was evaluated directly by IP:Western blot after overexpression of either WT or mutant mSin3A (Fig. 3E). Incubation in high glucose caused a 2.3-fold increase in MG modification of full-length WT mSin3A. In contrast, the double mutant mSin3A/925 + 938(Q) showed no increase in MG modification induced by incubation in high glucose. Using a two-color infrared fluorescent detection system, mSin3A and MG immunoreactivity were shown to co-localize. Loss of functionality of the mSin3A double mutant was demonstrated by identical experiments in which the effect of high glucose on Ang-2 expression was assessed (Fig. 3F). High glucose incubation of cells overexpressing WT mSin3A increased Ang-2 expression by 2.1-fold, whereas high glucose incubation of cells overexpressing mSin3A/925 + 938 (Q) had no effect on Ang-2 expression. Bar graphs showing quantification across replicates for Fig. 3, A-C, E, and F are presented in supplemental Fig. S1. To determine whether this mechanism is common to other cell type-relevant diabetic complications, we repeated the experiments shown in Fig. 3, E and F, in human aortic endothelial cells (supplemental Fig. S2) and in retinal Muller cells (data not shown). In both cell types, exposure to high glucose increased Ang-2 production through methylglyoxal modification of mSin3A. Association of Sp3 with OGT Causes Sp3 Glycosylation—To directly demonstrate that increased methylglyoxal induced by high glucose caused increased association of Sp3 with OGT, nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp3 and then immunoblotted for OGT and O-GlcNAc (Fig. 4A). High glucose increased association of Sp3 with OGT and also increased modification of Sp3 by O-GlcNAc. Overexpression of GLO1, as well as UCP-1 and SOD2, prevented both of these increases. These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-O-GlcNAc and immunoblotting for Sp3 (Fig. 4B). Bar graphs showing quantification across replicates for Fig. 4, A and B, are presented in supplemental Fig. S3. High Glucose-induced Ang-2 Increases ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 Expression in Both Cultured Cells and in Diabetic Mice—To determine whether the levels of Ang-2 induced in MKEC cells by high glucose were sufficient to induce expression of proinflammatory adhesion molecules in an autocrine fashion (12Fiedler U. Reiss Y. Scharpfenecker M. Grunow V. Koidl S. Thurston G. Gale N.W. Witzenrath M. Rosseau S. Suttorp N. Sobke A. Herrmann M. Preissner K.T. Vajkoczy P. Augustin H.G. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), we measured levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA and protein. As shown in Fig. 5, high glucose increased ICAM-1 (Fig. 5A) and VCAM-1 (Fig. 5B) mRNA levels (2.1- and 1.7-fold, respectively) and protein levels (1.8- and 1.6-fold, respectively in Fig. 5C). Low concentrations of mice TNF-α had no effect on ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression when MKECs were incubated in 5 mm glucose. However, the same concentration of mTNF-α further increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in MKECs incubated in 30 mm glucose, as shown in Fig. 5, A and B, for mRNA levels (3.3- and 3.7-fold, respectively), and protein levels (2.6- and 2.4-fold, respectively) in Fig. 5C. The effects of high glucose, both alone and in combination with TNF-α, were completely prevented by pretreatment with Ang-2 small interfering RNA. These data indicate that high glucose-induced Ang-2 is sufficient to sensitize microvascular endothelial cells to the proinflammatory effects of TNF-α. To determine whether these mechanisms are implicated in an in vivo model of diabetic nephropathy, kidneys were obtained from 5-month streptozotocin diabetic and agematched C57Blk6 mice. As shown in Fig. 5D, mRNA levels of Ang-2, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 increased 1.7-, 2.3-, and 1.9-fold, respectively. Corresponding protein levels increased 1.4-, 1.8-, and 2.1-fold, respectively (Fig. 5E). mSin3A modification by MG was increased 1.7-fold in kidneys from diabetic mice compared with WT (Fig. 5F). Bar graphs showing quantification across replicates for Fig. 5, C and F, are presented in supplemental Fig. S4. In the present study, we describe a novel mechanism for regulation of gene expression by high glucose: coregulatory protein modification by the glycolysis-derived dicarbonyl metabolite methylglyoxal. We demonstrate that in mouse kidney endothelial cells, increased glycolytic flux causes increased methylglyoxal modification of the corepressor mSin3A. Methylglyoxal modification of mSin3A results in increased recruitment of O-GlcNAc-transferase to an mSin3A-Sp3 complex, with consequent increased modification of Sp3 by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine. This modification of Sp3 causes decreased binding to a glucose-responsive GC-box in the angiopoietin-2 promoter, resulting in increased Ang-2 expression. High glucose-induced Ang-2 increased expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in both cultured cells and kidneys from diabetic mice and sensitized microvascular endothelial cells to the proinflammatory effects of TNF-α. In human aortic endothelial cells and in retinal Muller cells, the major cell type expressing angiopoietin-2 in the retina (19Sarthy V.P. Brodjian S.J. Dutt K. Kennedy B.N. French R.P. Crabb J.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 212-216PubMed Google Scholar), high glucose-induced Ang-2 expression is also mediated by this mechanism 4P. Scherer, personal communication. (supplemental Fig. 2). mSin3A has been shown to recruit the enzyme OGT to promoters in several tumor cell lines, which then acts in concert with histone deacetylation to promote gene silencing (16Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data in mouse kidney endothelial cells and in retinal Muller cells show that recruitment of OGT to mSin3A activates, rather than represses, gene expression when the mSin3A is modified by methylglyoxal arising from high glucose flux and reactive oxygen species formation by the mitochondrial electron transport chain. mSin3A binding with the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp3 has not been reported previously. Sp3 and Sp1 compete for common GC-rich target sequences in promoter elements (20Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 21Li L. He S. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 460-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Although both Sp3 and Sp1 may act as inhibitors or activators of gene expression, Sp3 has been found to repress Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation in a number of cell types (22Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 23Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.P. Galera P. J. Biol.

In 293 cells and SL2 cells, Sp3 was not modified by O-GlcNAc, as determined by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography (28Sapetschnig A. Koch F. Rischitor G. Mennenga T. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42095-42105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the effect of increased glucose flux on O-GlcNAc modification of Sp3 was not evaluated. Regulation of gene expression involves complex interactions among histones, transcription factors, coactivators, and corepressors. An emerging concept is that coactivator and corepressor proteins may be primary targets of physiologic signals, coordinating distinct biological programs (29Lin J. Wu P.H. Tarr P.T. Lindenberg K.S. St.-Pierre J. Zhang C.Y. Mootha V.K. Jager S. Vianna C.R. Reznick R.M. Cui L. Manieri M. Donovan M.X. Wu Z. Cooper M.P. Fan M.C. Rohas L.M. Zavacki A.M. Cinti S. Shulman G.I. Lowell B.B. Krainc D. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2004; 119: 121-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications of coactivator proteins have been described (30Fingerman I.M. Briggs S.D. Cell. 2004; 117: 690-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Nucifora G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that are thought to regulate coactivator function. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that methylglyoxal causes post-translational modification of a coregulator protein and that this modification affects gene expression. The extent of this modification reflects the net effect of a variety of intracellular processes, including metabolic flux and reactive oxygen formation, and may thus function as a new integrating signal to coordinately regulate distinct patterns of gene expression. The specific increase in Ang-2 expression by this mechanism in response to high glucose has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. High glucose-induced Ang-2 increased expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 both in cultured cells and in kidneys from diabetic mice and sensitized microvascular endothelial cells to the proinflammatory effects of TNF-α. TNF-α is elevated in both kidney and retina of diabetic animals, and both experimental diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are significantly attenuated in ICAM-1 knock-out mice (32Navarro J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2065409387,"O(2) is essential for aerobic life, and the classic view is that it diffuses freely across the plasma membrane. However, measurements of O(2) permeability of lipid bilayers have indicated that it is much lower than previously thought, and therefore, the existence of membrane O(2) channels has been suggested. We hypothesized that, besides its role as a water channel, aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) could also work as an O(2) transporter, because this transmembrane protein appears to be CO(2)-permeable and is highly expressed in cells with rapid O(2) turnover (erythrocytes and microvessel endothelium). Here we show that in mammalian cells overexpressing AQP-1 and exposed to hypoxia, the loss of cytosolic O(2), as well as stabilization of the O(2)-dependent hypoxia-inducible transcription factor and expression of its target genes, is accelerated. In normoxic endothelial cells, knocking down AQP-1 produces induction of hypoxia-inducible genes. Moreover, lung AQP-1 is markedly up-regulated in animals exposed to hypoxia. These data suggest that AQP-1 has O(2) permeability and thus could facilitate O(2) diffusion across the cell membrane."

Two type I PI 3-kinase isoforms (p110β and p110γ) have been implicated in Gi-dependent integrin αIIbβ3 regulation in platelets, however, the mechanisms by which they coordinate their signaling function remains unknown. By employing isoform-selective PI 3-kinase inhibitors and knock-out mouse models we have identified a unique mechanism of PI 3-kinase signaling co-operativity in platelets. We demonstrate that p110β is primarily responsible for Gi-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) production in ADP-stimulated platelets and is linked to the activation of Rap1b and AKT. In contrast, defective integrin αIIbβ3 activation in p110γ-/- platelets was not associated with alterations in the levels of PI(3,4)P2 or active Rap1b/AKT. Analysis of the effects of active site pharmacological inhibitors confirmed that p110γ principally regulated integrin αIIbβ3 activation through a non-catalytic signaling mechanism. Inhibition of the kinase function of PI 3-kinases, combined with deletion of p110γ, led to a major reduction in integrin αIIbβ3 activation, resulting in a profound defect in platelet aggregation, hemostatic plug formation, and arterial thrombosis.

Moreover, they demonstrate that the combined catalytic and non-catalytic signaling function of p110β and p110γ is critical for P2Y12/Gi-dependent integrinαIIbβ3 regulation.

Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). They are classified into several distinct groups (types I-III), based on their primary structure, mode of regulation, and substrate specificity (3Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The most intensely studied members of the PI 3-kinase superfamily are the type I PI 3-kinases, due to their involvement in the regulation of fundamental cell processes, including proliferation, glucose metabolism, survival, and migration (1Wymann M.P. Marone R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinases principally transduce signals through the catalytic generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2); second messengers that facilitate the recruitment of pleckstrin homology domain-containing signaling proteins to the plasma membrane (5Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The type I enzymes are divided into two subtypes, Ia and Ib; type Ia isoforms include p110α, -β, and -δ and type Ib includes a single isoform p110γ. p110α, -β, and -δ share common regulatory subunits (p85α, p85β, p55α, p55γ, p50α) and are classically regulated by tyrosine kinase-linked receptors, although G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of p110β has also been demonstrated (6Maier U.

The type Ib isoform, p110γ, plays an important role in innate immunity and in various inflammatory reactions linked to arthritis, pancreatitis, pulmonary inflammation, glomerulonephritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (13Ruckle T. Schwarz M.K. Rommel C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 903-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).

In platelets, both p110γ and p110β signal downstream of the purinergic P2Y12/Gi-coupled receptor and presumably regulate integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive function in a co-operative manner, although the basis for this has not been defined. In fact, one of the least clearly defined aspects of PI 3-kinase signaling are the mechanisms underlying signaling co-operativity between individual isoforms. In neutrophils, p110γ, p110β, and p110δ contribute to fMLP-induced superoxide generation (31Condliffe A.M. Davidson K. Anderson K.E. Ellson C.D. Crabbe T. Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Turner M.

Blood. 2005; 106: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) appear to be regulated by multiple PI 3-kinases, with the contribution of individual isoforms depending on the cell type and context of stimulation. The most straightforward explanation for co-operative PI 3-kinase isoform signaling is a simple amplifier effect, i.e. enhanced second messenger formation (3-phosphoinositides) through the cumulative impact of multiple enzymes. However, it is also possible that individual PI 3-kinases generate spatially and temporally distinct pools of 3-phosphoinositides that act to assemble discrete signaling complexes with complementary signaling functions. In addition, individual family members may also amplify the signals other PI 3-kinases, i.e. the initial production of a small amount of 3-phosphoinositides may enhance subsequent activation of other family members. This may involve PI(3,4,5)P3 binding to p85 (35Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or through recruitment of pleckstrin homology domain containing proteins that modulate PI 3-kinase activity. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and it is possible that multiple co-operative signaling processes operate in the cell. In the current study we have investigated the mechanisms underlying signaling co-operativity between p110γ and p110β in platelets. Our studies indicate that p110β predominately regulates Gi-dependent integrin αIIbβ3 activation through a classical lipid kinase-dependent mechanism, involving Rap1 and AKT, whereas p110γ appears to regulate integrin αIIbβ3 principally through a non-catalytic signaling mechanism. Moreover, inhibiting the kinase function of PI 3-kinases, in combination with p110γ deletion, led to a much greater defect in platelet adhesive function than inhibition of the catalytic function of PI 3-kinases alone. These studies demonstrate the existence of a co-operative PI 3-kinase signaling mechanism, involving the non-catalytic and catalytic function of p110γ and p110β, respectively. Furthermore, they demonstrate that this signaling mechanism is the predominant pathway utilized by the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor to regulate integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive function. These findings have potentially important implications for the antithrombotic potential of isoform-selective PI 3-kinase inhibitors.

PI 3-Kinase Lipid Kinase Assays—Lipid kinase assays were performed to determine the level of PI 3-kinase inhibition achieved in platelets following preincubation of mouse whole blood with vehicle/wortmannin, or following administration (intravenous bolus) of vehicle/wortmannin in mice. Platelets were isolated from whole blood as described above, lysed, and PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitated from platelet lysates using an anti-p85 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Kinase assays were performed on immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase according to a previously described method (43Foukas L.C. Daniele N. Ktori C. Anderson K.E. Jensen J. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitations were also were performed in the absence of the anti-p85 polyclonal antibody, and the resulting PI 3-kinase activity subtracted as background. Platelet Aggregation Studies—For aggregation studies, washed mouse platelets (2.0 × 108/ml) were preincubated with vehicle alone, LY294002 (25 μm), TGX221 (0.5 μm), D-010 (5 μm), or AS252424 (1-10 μm) prior to stimulation with the indicated concentrations of ADP in the presence of calcium (1 mm) and fibrinogen (500 μg/ml). All aggregations were initiated by stirring the suspensions at 600 rpm for 10 min at 37 °C in a four-channel automated platelet analyzer (AggRAM, Haem). The extent of platelet aggregation was defined as the percentage change in optical density as measured by the automated platelet analyzer. In Vitro Thrombus Formation under Flow—Flow-based thrombus formation assays on a bovine fibrillar type I collagen matrix were performed as described previously (44Mangin P. Yap C.L. Nonne C.

Anticoagulated whole blood (100 μg/ml lepirudin) collected from p110γ+/+ or p110γ-/- mice was labeled with DiOC6 (1 μm) and preincubated with vehicle (Me2SO) or wortmannin (400 nm) (10 min, 37 °C) prior to perfusion through fibrillar type I collagen-coated microcapillary tubes (2.5 mg/ml) at 1800 s-1 for up to 2.5 min. Thrombus formation was observed using an inverted Leica DMIRB microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and a ×63, 1.2 numeric aperture water objective. Images were acquired using a Dage-MTI charge-coupled device camera 300 ETRCX (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN). Analysis of thrombi volume and height was performed after 2.5 min (where thrombi reached a maximal volume in vehicle-treated p110γ+/+ platelets), as described previously. Total thrombus volume and maximum height of thrombi in a given field (covering 25,058.89 μm2) were calculated using Metamorph 6. Electrolytic Model of Occlusive Thrombus Formation—An in vivo electrolytic model of occlusive thrombus formation was performed as described previously (16Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Goncalves I. Nesbitt W.S. Yap C.L. Wright C.E. Kenche V. Anderson K.E. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Sturgeon S.A. Prabaharan H. Thompson P.E. Smith G.D. Shepherd P.R. Daniele N. Kulkarni S. Abbott B. Saylik D. Jones C.

Blood flow was monitored for 60 min, and changes in blood flow recorded offline for analysis. The total amount of blood flowing through the injured artery following vascular injury was determined by calculating the area under the blood flow curve, corrected for body weight. Tail Bleeding Studies in Mice—Tail bleeding time was measured in anesthetized (pentobarbitone 60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), ventilated p110γ+/+ and p110γ-/- mice, with body temperature maintained at 37 °C throughout the experiment (16Jackson S.P.

Tail bleeding was measured before and 10 min after administration of vehicle or wortmannin (0.1 mg/kg). Incisions 5-mm long and 1-mm deep were made, 10 mm from the tip of the tail, and bleeding was monitored by blotting the edge of the incision with a tissue every 30 s until it had ceased (=tail bleeding time). Histology—Carotid arteries were paraffin-embedded, processed, and stained using the Carstair stain, as described previously (44Mangin P. Yap C.L. Nonne C. Sturgeon S.A. Goncalves I. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Wright C.E. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 4346-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Using this staining technique, fibrin appears red, platelets appear blue/purple, red blood cells appear yellow, and collagen staining in the vessel wall appears blue. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Average S.E. for carotid blood flow over time was calculated from repeated measures of analysis variance. When comparing matched values between two treatment groups, an unpaired Student's t test with two-way analysis of variance was used (Prism software, GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA) (not significant; p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Relative Roles of Type I PI 3-Kinase Isoforms in Gi-dependent Integrin αIIbβ3 Activation—ADP is an important platelet agonist stimulating integrin αIIbβ3 activation through two purinergic receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12 (45Gachet C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 108: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). P2Y1 is a Gq-coupled receptor that induces activation of phospholipase Cβ and transient calcium mobilization, whereas P2Y12 is a Gi-coupled receptor linked to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of PI 3-kinase (45Gachet C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 108: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ADP binding to P2Y1 stimulates transient integrin αIIbβ3 activation, whereas P2Y12 amplifies and sustains integrin αIIbβ3 activation, necessary for stable platelet aggregation. To examine the contribution of PI 3-kinases to integrin αIIbβ3 activation over a broad range of ADP concentrations, fibrinogen binding studies were performed on murine platelets in the presence of the pan-PI 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 or wortmannin. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, stimulation of platelets with increasing concentrations of ADP led to a dose-dependent increase in fibrinogen binding (Fig. 1). This increase was specific to integrin αIIbβ3 as it was completely eliminated by an anti-integrin αIIbβ3 receptor antagonist (data not shown). Pretreating platelets with LY294002 decreased fibrinogen binding by 75-85% over a broad range of ADP concentra"
https://openalex.org/W2027110836,"In mammalian cells, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) is mainly synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine (Kennedy) pathway and by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). However, the extent to which these two pathways contribute to overall PtdEtn synthesis both quantitatively and qualitatively is still not clear. To assess their contributions, PtdEtn species synthesized by the two routes were labeled with pathway-specific stable isotope precursors, d3-serine and d4-ethanolamine, and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major conclusions from this study are that (i) in both McA-RH7777 and Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was favored over PtdSer decarboxylation, and (ii) both pathways for PtdEtn synthesis are able to produce all diacyl-PtdEtn species, but most of these species were preferentially made by one pathway. For example, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway preferentially synthesized phospholipids with mono- or di-unsaturated fatty acids on the sn-2 position (e.g. (16:0-18:2)PtdEtn and (18:1-18:2)PtdEtn), whereas PtdSer decarboxylation generated species with mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids on the sn-2 position (e.g. (18:0-20:4)PtdEtn and (18:0-20:5)PtdEtn in McArdle and (18: 0-20:4)PtdEtn and (18:0-22:6)PtdEtn in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells). (iii) The main PtdEtn species newly synthesized from the Kennedy pathway in the microsomal fraction appeared to equilibrate rapidly between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. (iv) Newly synthesized PtdEtn species preferably formed in the mitochondria, which is at least in part due to the substrate specificity of the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, seemed to be retained in this organelle. Our data suggest a potentially essential role of the PtdSer decarboxylation pathway in mitochondrial functioning. In mammalian cells, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) is mainly synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine (Kennedy) pathway and by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). However, the extent to which these two pathways contribute to overall PtdEtn synthesis both quantitatively and qualitatively is still not clear. To assess their contributions, PtdEtn species synthesized by the two routes were labeled with pathway-specific stable isotope precursors, d3-serine and d4-ethanolamine, and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major conclusions from this study are that (i) in both McA-RH7777 and Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was favored over PtdSer decarboxylation, and (ii) both pathways for PtdEtn synthesis are able to produce all diacyl-PtdEtn species, but most of these species were preferentially made by one pathway. For example, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway preferentially synthesized phospholipids with mono- or di-unsaturated fatty acids on the sn-2 position (e.g. (16:0-18:2)PtdEtn and (18:1-18:2)PtdEtn), whereas PtdSer decarboxylation generated species with mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids on the sn-2 position (e.g. (18:0-20:4)PtdEtn and (18:0-20:5)PtdEtn in McArdle and (18: 0-20:4)PtdEtn and (18:0-22:6)PtdEtn in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells).

Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1996: 1-33Google Scholar). Three pathways are present for PtdEtn biosynthesis. The majority of PtdEtn is synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway and PtdSer decarboxylation, whereas the third route, calcium stimulated base-exchange, is of little significance (2Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) pathway, ethanolamine is converted to PtdEtn by the sequential actions of ethanolamine kinase, CTP: phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase and finally choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase. Choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase has a dual specificity, as it can use both CDP-choline (CDP-Cho) and CDP-Etn as substrates for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and PtdEtn, respectively (3Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase, a CDP-choline-specific cholinephosphotransferase is available for PtdCho biosynthesis (4Henneberry A.L. Wistow G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29808-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). phosphatidylethanolamine CDP-ethanolamine CDP-choline choline endoplasmic reticulum ethanolamine mitochondria-associated membrane phosphatidylserine decarboxylase phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine serine Chinese hamster ovary high performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. The PtdSer decarboxylation pathway for PtdEtn biosynthesis was first described by Borkenhagen et al. (5Borkenhagen L.F. Kennedy E.P. Fielding L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: PC28-PC30Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In this pathway PtdSer synthesized from PtdCho or PtdEtn by phosphatidylserine synthase-1 and -2, respectively (2Vance J.E.

To date, only one mammalian PSD has been cloned (8Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the enzyme was shown to be located on the external aspect of the inner mitochondrial membrane (9Zborowski J. Dygas A.

Acta. 1974; 360: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because PtdSer synthesis occurs in the ER and especially in ER-related membranes termed mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) (2Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 11Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PtdSer decarboxylation requires transport of PtdSer from its site of synthesis to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where PSD is located (12Shiao Y.J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Vance J.E. J. Biol.

The relative importance of the CDP-Etn and PtdSer decarboxylation pathways to overall PtdEtn biosynthesis appears to vary depending on cell type and the availability of the substrates ethanolamine and serine, respectively. From studies in Chinese hamster ovary (15Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Miller M.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and baby hamster kidney (17Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) cells that were cultured in medium with fetal bovine serum being the sole source of ethanolamine, it was concluded that PtdSer decarboxylation was the major pathway for PtdEtn synthesis. However, observations in hamster heart (18Zelinski T.A. Choy P.C. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in rat liver, hepatocytes, heart, and kidney (19Arthur G. Page L. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Tijburg L.B. Geelen M.J. van Golde L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) illustrated that the vast majority of PtdEtn is synthesized via the CDP-Etn pathway. A possible explanation for these opposite results is the availability of exogenous ethanolamine. All studies mentioned above employed incorporation of radioactive serine and ethanolamine into PtdEtn. Because of the presence of endogenous pools of unlabeled ethanolamine and serine, the quantitative contributions of both pathways to overall PtdEtn synthesis are still unclear. An intriguing question is why two pathways for PtdEtn biosynthesis exist, whereas only one pathway is available for the de novo synthesis of PtdCho in most mammalian cells. First, a second biosynthetic pathway could serve as a backup pathway under conditions where one of the two pathways is not able to function properly. Second, the two pathways could serve mainly to “locally” supply certain organelles with PtdEtn for maintaining specific molecular species profiles within these organelles. Finally, it is possible that the two pathways yield different molecular species profiles as was shown for the synthesis of PtdCho (CDP-Cho pathway versus PtdEtn methylation) in rat hepatocytes (21DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The large molecular diversity of PtdEtn and other phospholipid subclasses is dictated by the combination of different lengths, number of unsaturations, and types of linkages of the hydrocarbon chains. An ester linkage at the sn-1 position defines a diacyl molecular subspecies, whereas an ether linkage at this position defines a plasmanyl subspecies, and a plasmalogen subspecies is defined by a vinyl ether bond at the sn-1 position, as in all three subspecies the hydrocarbon chain at the sn-2 position is known to be linked to the glycerol backbone via an ester bond (22Hsu F.F. Turk J. Thukkani A.K. Messner M.C. Wildsmith K.R. Ford D.A. J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 38: 752-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The development and refinement of mass spectrometry in combination with the availability of deuterated pathway-specific precursors has opened the possibility of specifically displaying the PtdEtn species synthesized via the CDP-Etn or PtdSer decarboxylation pathways. We report here that McA-RH7777 cells, when cultured at equimolar concentrations of ethanolamine and serine, prefer the CDP-Etn pathway over PtdSer decarboxylation in a ratio of ∼2:1, with the decarboxylation route having a preference for the synthesis of long chain, polyunsaturated species. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and horse serum were from Invitrogen. d9-choline (HO(CH2)2N+ (CD3)3), l-(2,3,3-d3)-serine, and d4-ethanolamine (HOCD2CD2NH2) were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA. Tissue culture flasks were from Corning Inc., Acton, MA. Cell Culture—McArdle (McA-RH7777, ATCC CRL-1601) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1, ATCC CRL-9618) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum and 6% horse serum and Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. The cells were maintained in 80-cm2 culture flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 90% humidity. Incorporation of Deuterium-labeled Precursors into PtdEtn, PtdCho, and PtdSer—Cells were grown in “full” Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to 60–80% confluency in 175-cm2 culture flasks. For deuterium-label studies, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serine- and choline-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with serum as mentioned earlier) for 6, 24, or 72 h in the presence of 400 μm d9-choline (d9-Cho) and either 400 μm d4-ethanolamine (d4-Etn) or d3-serine (d3-Ser). To maintain similar substrate concentrations during incubation, 400 μm unlabeled serine was supplemented to the culture medium of the d4-ethanolamine incubations and vice versa. Incubations were stopped by washing the cells three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were scraped into methanol. Total lipids were extracted, and phospholipid classes were isolated by normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and analyzed as described in one of the sections below. Subcellular Fractionation of McA-RH7777 Cells—Mitochondrial and microsomal fractions were isolated from labeled McA-RH7777 cells essentially as described for rat liver by Shiao et al. (12Shiao Y.J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and homogenized in ice-cold isolation medium (250 mm mannitol, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). After removal of nuclei and cell debris, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet crude mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to pellet microsomes. The mitochondrial pellet was further purified from MAM by hand homogenization in isolation medium and layering of the homogenate on top of Percoll medium (225 mm mannitol, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 30% (v/v) Percoll) followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 95,000 × g. Purity of mitochondria and characterization of microsomes was assessed by assaying for succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial marker enzyme) and aryl esterase (ER marker) and by Western blotting for cytochrome c (mitochondrial marker) and calnexin (ER marker). Analysis of Phosphatidylethanolamine Molecular Species—Total lipids were extracted from cells and mitochondrial and microsomal fractions according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). The obtained total lipid extract was dissolved in hexane/isopropanol/acetone (82:17:1, v/v/v). Lipid classes were separated on a normal-phase HPLC column as described (24Brouwers J.F. Gadella B.M. van Golde L.M. Tielens A.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 344-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the PtdEtn fraction was collected manually from the column effluent using a flow splitter, dried under nitrogen, and stored at -20 °C till analysis. The fraction was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and PtdEtn species were separated on two Synergi 4 μm MAX-RP 18A columns (250 × 3 mm) (Phenomenex, CA) in series as described (25Brouwers J.F. Vernooij E.A. Tielens A.G. van Golde L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 164-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a slightly modified mobile phase of acetonitrile/methanol (2:3, v/v). Identification of molecular species was performed by on-line tandem mass spectrometry in the negative-ion mode on an API 4000 Q Trap mass spectrometer fitted with an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization source (Sciex, Ontario, Canada). Analysis of PtdEtn molecular species compositions and deuterium labeling was performed by on-line single quadrupole mass spectrometry in the negative-ion mode on an API 3000 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization source (Sciex). Nitrogen was used as nebulizer gas and curtain gas. PtdEtn molecular species compositions were determined by extracting the (labeled) molecular ions and isotope peaks of the various species from the negative Q1 chromatogram representing total PtdEtn, which was verified by detection with a Varex MKIII evaporative light scattering detector (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) operated at 100 °C at a gas flow of 1.8 liters/min. Determination of the position of the ester linkage of fatty acids to glycerophosphoethanolamine was performed according to Brouwers et al. (25Brouwers J.F. Vernooij E.A. Tielens A.G. van Golde L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 164-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evaporative light scattering detector data were analyzed using EZChrom software (Scientific Software, San Ramon, Canada), and mass spectrometric data were analyzed using Analyst1.4 software (Sciex). Analysis of Phosphatidylcholine Molecular Species—The PtdCho fraction of cells and mitochondrial and microsomal fractions was isolated from total lipid extracts by normal-phase HPLC as described in the previous section. The fraction was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and PtdCho molecular species were separated on two LiChrospher 100 RP18-e columns (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm; Merck) in series as previously (24Brouwers J.F. Gadella B.M. van Golde L.M. Tielens A.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 344-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a slightly modified mobile phase of acetonitrile/methanol/triethylamine (25:24:1, v/v/v). Identification of molecular species was performed by on-line tandem mass spectrometry in the positive-ion mode on an API 4000 Q Trap mass spectrometer fitted with an electrospray ionization source (Sciex). Deuterium labeling of the various molecular species was determined by on-line mass spectrometry in the positive-ion mode on an API 2000 Q Trap mass spectrometer operated in enhanced (trapping) mode fitted with an electrospray ionization source (Sciex). PtdCho molecular species compositions were determined by evaporative light scattering detector detection as described above. Determination of the position of the ester linkage of fatty acids to glycerophosphocholine was performed according to Brouwers et al. (25Brouwers J.F. Vernooij E.A. Tielens A.G. van Golde L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 164-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evaporative light scattering detector and mass spectrometric data were analyzed using software as described above. Analysis of Phosphatidylserine Molecular Species—The Ptd-Ser fraction of cells and mitochondrial and microsomal fractions was isolated from total lipid extracts by normal-phase HPLC as described above. The fraction was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and PtdSer molecular species were separated on a Synergi 4 μm MAX-RP 18A column (250 × 3 mm) (Phenomenex, CA) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/methanol/H2O (15:22.5:12.5, v/v/v) containing 1 μm serine and 2.5 mm ammonium acetate. Analysis and identification of molecular species was performed by on-line (tandem) mass spectrometry in the negative enhanced mass spectrometry ion mode on an API 4000 Q Trap mass spectrometer fitted with an electrospray ionization source. Ptd-Ser species compositions were determined in PtdSer fractions obtained from unlabeled cells by extracting the molecular ions and isotope peaks of various species from the negative neutral loss 87-chromatogram representing total PtdSer. Interpretation of Mass Spectra—The incorporation of d4-Etn into PtdEtn and d9-Cho into PtdCho was calculated for all molecular species by determining the intensities of the unlabeled and labeled molecular ion peak in the negative or positive Q1 mass spectrum and expressing the intensity of the labeled molecular ion as the percentage of the sum of the unlabeled and labeled molecular ion. d3-Ser incorporation into PtdEtn and PtdSer was calculated similarly from (enhanced) negative Q1 spectra. Because d3-Ser labeling also, unexpectedly, yielded significant d2-Ser labeling (see “Discussion”), this d2-Ser incorporation had to be taken into account for determination of the total d3-Ser incorporation into the various PtdEtn and PtdSer species. All PtdCho, PtdEtn, and PtdSer molecular ions display isotope peaks in Q1 mass spectra (Fig. 1, C and D), originating from the natural presence of 13C in these large biomolecules. To determine total d3-Ser incorporation into PtdEtn and PtdSer molecular species, the natural contribution of 13C to the intensities of the isotope peaks of each molecular ion was subtracted from the actual, measured intensities of the isotope peaks in the Q1 mass spectra obtained, the remaining “isotope peak” intensities (exemplified for PtdEtn in Fig. 1D) representing total d3-Ser incorporation into the various PtdEtn and PtdSer species. Measuring the Intracellular Deuterated to “Cold” Serine and Ethanolamine Ratio—Cells were labeled with 400 μm d3-Ser or d4-Etn for various times up to 6 h and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before extracting the water-soluble components (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). The water-methanol phase was collected and evaporated to dryness, and the primary amines Ser and Etn were subsequently derivatized with fluorescamine exactly as described (26De Bernardo S. Weigele M. Toome V. Manhart K. Leimgruber W. Bohlen P. Stein S. Udenfriend S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 163: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The deuterated to cold ratio was determined using mass spectrometry. Determination of the Substrate Specificity of Phosphatidyl-serine Decarboxylase—The substrate (d3-labeled egg-PtdSer and various PtdSer molecular species) required to determine the substrate specificity of PSD by using a mass spectrometry approach was synthesized from their respective PtdCho species. Briefly, 2.5 mg of PtdCho was dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform, after which 25 mg of silica (kieselgel 60 for column chromatography) was added. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and carefully dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Subsequently, 250 μl of 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.6) containing 100 mm CaCl2, 50 mg/ml d3-serine, and 10 units of phospholipase D (Streptomycin species) was added to the silica, and the suspension was incubated for 36–48 h at 30 °C while shaking continuously. The reaction was stopped by adding 470 μl of H2O and 80 μl of 6 m HCl, and phospholipids were extracted (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar, 27Yamane T. Iwasaki Y. Mizumoto Y. Kasai M. Okada T. 2003Google Scholar). The amount of d3-PtdEtn formed was quantified using the phosphorus assay (28Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). PSD activity was measured in mitochondria, prepared as described in the subcellular fractionation section, as the formation of d3-PtdEtn from d3-PtdSer (29Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14671-14676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (final volume 0.4 ml) consisted of 100 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg of Triton X-100/ml of assay mixture, 50 μm PtdSer (d3-egg PtdSer or a mixture of equal amounts (10 μm) of d3-(16:0-16:0) PtdSer, d3-(16:0-20:4) PtdSer, d3-(18:0-18:1) PtdSer, d3-(18:0-18:2) PtdSer, and d3-(18:0-20:4) PtdSer) and enzyme (∼250 μg of mitochondrial protein). Assays were carried out for 45 min at 37 °C and were terminated by adding 3.4 ml of chloroform/methanol/H2O (15:29:6, by volume) followed by lipid extraction. After removing the Triton X-100 using small silica (kieselgel 60) columns, the amount of d3-PtdSer (substrate) and d3-PtdEtn (product) was quantified as described above. Pathway-specific Monitoring of Phosphatidylethanolamine Biosynthesis in McA-RH7777 Cells—To get insight into the qualitative and quantitative contributions of the CDP-Etn pathway and PtdSer decarboxylation to overall PtdEtn synthesis in mammalian cells, McA-RH7777 (McArdle) cells were incubated in the presence of deuterated, pathway-specific precursors. After various times, total lipids were extracted and subfractionated into phospholipid subclasses, and the PtdEtn fraction was analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS). A typical chromatogram of the HPLC separation of McArdle PtdEtn molecular species is shown in Fig. 1A, with the peak identification given in Table 1. The major advantage of on-line HPLC separation before MS is that isobaric molecular species, i.e. species having the same mass but different radyl groups in their diacylglycerol backbones, are largely separated, thus allowing individual analysis.TABLE 1Phosphatidylethanolamine molecular species composition in McA-RH7777 cells, mitochondria and microsomes The PtdEtn fraction was collected from total lipid extracts of McA-RH7777 cells, mitochondria and microsomes, and the molecular species compositions were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown in this table is the PtdEtn molecular species composition (first row) of the total cell homogenate (third row), the mitochondrial fraction (fourth row), and the microsomal fraction (fifth row). The second row indicates the chromatogram peak in which the various molecular species elute in the HPLC-MS chromatogram displayed in Fig. 1A.

In d3-Ser, three carbon-bound protons of serine are replaced by deuterium atoms. Once the d3-Ser label is incorporated into the head group of PtdSer species, the 3-Da mass difference between labeled PtdSer species and their non-labeled counterparts is retained upon decarboxylation to PtdEtn (Fig. 1D; the unexpected appearance of d2-PtdSer will be explained under “Discussion” and is corrected for, see “Experimental Procedures”). In addition to PtdSer decarboxylation, (labeled) serine can be incorporated into PtdEtn via two other routes; (i) it can enter the CDP-Etn pathway as (labeled) phosphoethanolamine, generated as an intermediate of sphingomyelin metabolism (30Merrill A.H. Jones Jr., D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and (ii) it can be incorporated into the diacylglycerol moiety (31Steenbergen R. Nanowski T.S. Nelson R. Young S.G. Vance J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, experiments with β-chloro-l-alanine, a potent inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthesis (32Medlock K.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), revealed that phosphoethanolamine liberated from sphingomyelin breakdown only marginally (<2%) contributed to serine labeling of PtdEtn in our experimental system (data not shown). Furthermore, only a slight amount of deuterium label was detected in the diacylglycerol moiety of PtdEtn and PtdCho in McArdle cells labeled with d3-Ser for 24 h, which was clear from the fact that less than 4% of the PtdCho molecules were detected with a mass up to 3 mass units heavier than the parental molecular species. Therefore, it was concluded that in McArdle cells deuterated Ser-labeled PtdEtn species were derived from PtdSer decarboxylation (>95%). Qualitative and Quantitative Contributions of the CDP-ethanolamine Pathway and PtdSer Decarboxylation to Overall Phosphatidylethanolamine Synthesis—We first determined a suitable labeling time to study the contribution of the various pathways to phospholipid biosynthesis by labeling McArdle cells with 400 μm d9-Cho and 400 μm d4-Etn for 6, 24, and 72 h. Because McArdle cells have only one route for de novo PtdCho synthesis, namely the CDP-Cho pathway, it was expected that all PtdCho species would be labeled to the same extent when remodeling was completed. Fig. 2A shows that already after 6 h 24% of PtdCho mass in the cells is de novo-synthesized, but n"

Maintaining a balance between anterograde and retrograde trafficking of channel proteins is vital in regulating steady-state cell surface expression. Kv1.5 is an important voltage-gated K+ channel in the cardiovascular system underlying the ultra-rapid rectifying potassium current (Ikur), a major repolarizing current in atrial myocytes, and regulating the resting membrane potential and excitability of smooth muscle cells. Defects in the expression of Kv1.5 are associated with pathological states such as chronic atrial fibrillation and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. There is, thus, substantial interest in understanding the mechanisms regulating cell surface channel levels. Here, we investigated the internalization and recycling of Kv1.5 in the HL-1 immortalized mouse atrial myocytes. Kinetic studies indicate that Kv1.5 is rapidly internalized to a perinuclear region where it co-localizes with the early endosomal marker, EEA1. Importantly, we identified that a population of Kv1.5, originating on the cell surface, internalized and recycled back to the plasma membrane. Notably, Kv1.5 recycling processes are driven by specific Rab-dependent endosomal compartments. Thus, co-expression of GDP-locked Rab4S22N and Rab11S25N dominant-negative mutants decreased the steady-state Kv1.5 surface levels, whereas GTPase-deficient Rab4Q67L and Rab11Q70L mutants increased steady-state Kv1.5 surface levels. These data reveal an unexpected dynamic trafficking of Kv1.5 at the myocyte plasma membrane and demonstrate a role for recycling in the maintenance of steady-state ion channel surface levels."

They bypass the first site of respiratory energy conservation, constituted by the type I NADH dehydrogenases. To investigate substrate specificities and Ca2+ binding properties of seven predicted type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases of Arabidopsis thaliana we have produced them as T7-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The NDB1 and NDB2 enzymes were found to bind Ca2+, and a single amino acid substitution in the EF hand motif of NDB1 abolished the Ca2+ binding. NDB2 and NDB4 functionally complemented an E. coli mutant deficient in endogenous type I and type II NADH dehydrogenases. This demonstrates that these two plant enzymes can substitute for the NADH dehydrogenases in the bacterial respiratory chain. Three NDB-type enzymes displayed distinct catalytic profiles with substrate specificities and Ca2+ stimulation being considerably affected by changes in pH and substrate concentrations. Under physiologically relevant conditions, the NDB1 fusion protein acted as a Ca2+-dependent NADPH dehydrogenase. NDB2 and NDB4 fusion proteins were NADH-specific, and NDB2 was stimulated by Ca2+. The observed activity profiles of the NDB-type enzymes provide a fundament for understanding the mitochondrial system for direct oxidation of cytosolic NAD(P)H in plants.

They are widely distributed among plants, fungi, protists, many bacteria, and Archaea but not found in animals (1Kerscher S.J. Biochim. Biophys.

In mitochondria of many species, the enzyme works in parallel to complex I, which is a multisubunit proton pumping type I NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (4Rasmusson A.G. Heiser V. Zabaleta E.

The type II NAD(P)H DHs usually possess one non-co-valently bound FAD, except for in hyperthermophilic Archaea, where FAD is replaced by FMN (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence of most enzymes contains two well conserved motifs for dinucleotide binding (1Kerscher S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In many organisms the presence of several type II DH isoenzymes increases the catalytic flexibility of respiratory NAD(P)H oxidation. In bacteria and yeast, diverse roles have been implicated for different homologs. For example, a catalytic function in redox balancing was suggested for homologs in yeast (1Kerscher S.J. Biochim.

Udall P.K. Vermaas W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3994-4003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, the relative expression of gene homologs varies between tissues (8Michalecka A.M. Svensson Å. S.

The differential gene expression of plant type II NAD(P)H DH homologs points to diverse physiological roles of the enzymes. In mitochondria of plants and fungi, type II NAD(P)H DHs are attached to the inner and outer surface of the inner membrane (2Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Rasmusson A.G. Soole K.L. Elthon T.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). External NADH and NADPH oxidation measured in isolated plant mitochondria is generally dependent on Ca2+ (3Rasmusson A.G. Soole K.L. Elthon T.E. Annu. Rev.

NADH oxidation has even been observed in the absence of Ca2+ for several plant materials (14Escobar M.A. Geisler D.A. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2006; 45: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Nash D. Wiskich J.T. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 627-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zottini M. Mandolino G. Zannoni D. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that there are separate DHs, each relatively specific for external NADH and NADPH oxidation in plants (20Fredlund K.M. Rasmusson A.G. Møller I.M. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Michalecka A.M. Agius S.C. Møller I.M. Rasmusson A.G.

However, the absence of specific inhibitors has made it difficult to study the isoenzymes individually in isolated mitochondria. Several proteins showing NAD(P)H oxidation in the presence of artificial electron acceptors have been purified from different plant species (23Luethy M.H. Hayes M.K. Elthon T.E.

However, the requirement for artificial quinones, which can affect substrate specificity and Ca2+ dependence (25Menz R.I. Day D.A.

Based on sequence homology to type II NAD(P)H DHs in yeast and E. coli, two genes, nda1 and ndb1, were described in potato, and their gene products were localized to the internal and external side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, respectively (40Rasmusson A.G. Svensson Å. S. Knoop V. Grohmann L. Brennicke A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Homologs of type II NAD(P)H DHs with high amino acid sequence similarity to the potato NDA1 and NDB1 proteins are also present in rice and Arabidopsis thaliana (8Michalecka A.M. Svensson Å. S. Johansson F.I. Agius S.C. Johanson U. Brennicke A. Binder S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The seven homologs found in A. thaliana group into three families. These are nda1-2 and ndb1-4, all of which are closely related to fungal homologs, and ndc1, which groups together with cyanobacterial homologs upon phylogenetic analysis (8Michalecka A.M.

The N termini of homologs of all three families target green fluorescent protein to mitochondria (8Michalecka A.M. Svensson Å. S. Johansson F.I. Agius S.C. Johanson U. Brennicke A. Binder S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Intramitochondrial localization studies suggest that NDB1, NDB2, and NDB4 are external enzymes, whereas NDA- and NDC-type proteins are internally located (9Elhafez D. Murcha M.W. Clifton R. Soole K.L. Day D.A. Whelan J. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The plant NDB homologs cluster together with NDE1 of N. crassa, and all of these proteins contain an insertion with more or less degenerate EF hand motifs for Ca2+ binding (8Michalecka A.M.

However, Ca2+ binding by the enzymes has not been shown experimentally. For plants, a substrate has been identified only for the NDB1 homolog of potato, which is an external Ca2+-dependent NADPH DH, as shown by overproduction in tobacco plants (21Michalecka A.M. Agius S.C. Møller I.M. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2004; 37: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Substantial correlative evidence in potato and A. thaliana indicates that NDA1 is a matrix-facing NADH DH (9Elhafez D. Murcha M.W. Clifton R. Soole K.L. Day D.A. Whelan J.

Defining the substrate and Ca2+ specificities of the A. thaliana homologs is essential for interpretation of gene expression profiles and for elucidating the physiological roles of these enzymes. In this study we have analyzed the Ca2+ binding properties of the A. thaliana type II NAD(P)H DHs and characterized three of the enzymes in terms of substrate specificities and Ca2+ stimulation. NDB1, NDB2, and NDB4 were found to be principally able to oxidize both NADH and NADPH. However, the enzymes showed high substrate specificity at physiologically relevant substrate concentrations and pH.

Attempts to clone the complete Atndb3 by reverse transcription-PCR were unsuccessful, as previously reported by another group (9Elhafez D. Murcha M.W. Clifton R. Soole K.L. Day D.A. Whelan J. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The following sense primers were adapted for EcoRI and the antisense primers for EagI: Atnda1, 5′-GGA ATT CAA AGA GGG AGA GAA GCC GAG A-3′ and 5′-ATA TCG GCC GTC AGA TTC GGC TAA TGT C-3′; Atnda2, 5′-GGA ATT CAG AGA AGG AGA GAA GCC GAG AG-3′ and 5′-ACG GCC GTT AGA TAC GGC TAA TGT CAC GA-3′; Atndb1, 5′-GGA ATT CGA GGA GCA TAA GAA GAA GA-3′ and 5′-ACG GCC GTC AGA TGC GGC TTG AAT-3′; Atndb2, 5′-GGC GAA TTC ACT GGA ACC AAG AAG AAG AAG-3′ and 5′-TTA CGG CCG TCA GAT GCT ACT GGA ATC TCT A-3′; Atndc1, 5′-GCG AAT TCC CTG ATA ACA AGA GGC CAA-3′ and 5′-TAC GGC CGT CAA GAA CCA GAC AAA ACC-3′. For Atndb3 and Atndb4, a BamHI restriction site was introduced in the sense primer, and an XhoI restriction site was introduced in the antisense primer: Atndb3, 5′-GGA TCC AAG AAA GAG TTT GAT GTT GA-3′ and 5′-CTC GAG ACA TCT TCC CGT TGT TAT GC-3′; Atndb4, 5′-GGA TCC AAC CCA ATA AGG AAG AAG AAG G-3′ and 5′-CTC GAG AGA AGA ATG GCT TAG ATG CTG C-3′. PCR was done using the Advantage-HF 2 proofreading PCR kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Products were cloned with the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Cloned DNA was excised using the restriction sites introduced by the primers and ligated into pET21a (Novagen). The final plasmids were analyzed by DNA sequencing and were found consistent with available cDNAs and genomic annotations. These were: BT005564, Atnda1; AC004680, Atnda2; NM_118962, Atndb1; BT002241, Atndb2; NM_118269, Atndb3; NM_127645, Atndb4. For Atndc1, NM_120955 and the correction (AJ715502) (11Escobar M.A. Franklin K.A. Svensson Å. S. Salter M.G. Whitelam G.C. Rasmusson A.G. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2710-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were used. The plasmids were denoted pET-T7Atnda1, -T7Atnda2, -T7Atndb1, -T7Atndb2, -T7Atndb3, -T7Atndb4, and -T7Atndc1. All plasmids encode recombinant A. thaliana polypeptides truncated at the N-terminal end as compared with the full-length proteins and instead carry an N-terminal T7 tag of 14 or 16 residues. The T7 tag is fused to amino acid residue 69 in NDA1, 67 in NDA2, 45 in NDB1, 54 in NDB2, 153 in NDB3, 59 in NDB4, and 76 in NDC1 (supplemental Fig. 1). Mutagenesis of pET-T7Atndb1—A single base pair substitution changing the codon GAC (Asp-387) to GCC (Ala) in NDB1 was introduced using PCR. A forward primer, 5′-ATC CTT CCT GGC TCA CTG-3′, and a reverse mismatch-primer, 5′-TCT TCC ATG GTC AAG GTT CCT GAG TTG GCC GCA TC-3′, containing the new codon and an NcoI recognition site were used for amplification. The products were cloned into a TOPO vector, cut out with HindIII and NcoI, and then inserted into the pET-T7Atndb1 cut with the same enzymes to replace the wild type segment. The obtained plasmid was denoted pET-T7Atndb1-D387A and confirmed by DNA sequencing of the inserted region. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—For Ca2+ binding studies, the pET21 derivatives were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS. Cells were collected from plates and grown in 50 ml of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 200 rpm orbital shaking. At an A600 of ∼0.5, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 1 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, washed in 50 mm Tris/Cl pH 8.0, resuspended in 1 ml of high salt medium I (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris/Cl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For complementation studies and in vitro NAD(P)H oxidation assays, the recombinant genes on plasmids were expressed in the E. coli strain MWC008(DE3). The ndh and nuo genes in MWC008 are defective by insertional disruption using kanamycin and tetracycline resistance markers (43Calhoun M.W. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3013-3019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene for T7 RNA polymerase was introduced into the MWC008 chromosome using the λDE3 lysogenization kit (Novagen). In the presence of 0.1–1 mm IPTG negative effects on growth were observed for the MWC008(DE3) strain harboring pET21a (not shown), and therefore, IPTG was not added to the cultures. Low levels of T7 RNA polymerase are most likely produced in MWC008(DE3) also in the absence of IPTG, and this was sufficient for the transcription of genes cloned in pET21a. The wild type E. coli strain AN387 (44Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) was used as a control. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: 12 μg/ml tetracycline, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. For minimal media, M63 agar (45Silhávy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 217-222Google Scholar) was supplemented with 30 mm glucose or mannitol. For liquid cultures, colonies were resuspended from LB plates, and 0.5 or 1 liter of LB medium containing 0.5% glucose and appropriate antibiotics was inoculated to give an A600 of ∼0.05. The cultures were grown in 5-liter baffled flasks at 30 °C and 80–90 rpm for 16–18 h. At an A600 of 1.2–1.8, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and washed in 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0. Cell pellets were stored at -20 °C until used for membrane isolation. Protein Extraction—Extraction of protein for the Ca2+ binding assay was done from transformed BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells frozen in high salt medium I. During thawing of the cells, protease inhibitors were added at the following final concentrations: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane, 1 μm pepstatin, and 2 μm leupeptin. The cell suspensions were sonicated for 5 × 5s and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in high salt medium I supplemented with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and incubated with stirring for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation as above, the pellets constituting insoluble protein fractions were resuspended in high salt medium I containing 6 m urea and incubated as above. Urea-extracted proteins were collected by taking the supernatant after a final centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein Analyses—Polypeptides were resolved in 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE gels and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or wet-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described (14Escobar M.A. Geisler D.A. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2006; 45: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). T7-tagged protein was immunodecorated using a T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and detected as described (46Duval F.D. Renard M. Jaquinod M. Biou V. Montrichard F. Macherel D. Plant J. 2002; 32: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). T7 signal intensity was calculated using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis software. Radioactive labeling of electroblotted proteins was carried out as previously described (47Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) with 1.6 μm 45CaCl2 as the probe and H2O as the washing solution. Radioactive label was detected with phosphor screens using a Personal Molecular Imager FX and the image-processing program Quantity One (Bio-Rad). As molecular mass markers in SDS-PAGE, the low molecular weight marker kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder (Fermentas) were used. The prestained molecular marker proteins bound 45Ca2+, as previously observed (47Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation—MWC008(DE3) cells harboring different plasmids were resuspended to 1/30 of the culture volume in high salt medium II (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) supplemented with 4 mm MgSO4, 2 μg/ml DNase I, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was passed twice through a French press cell operated at 18,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The obtained pellet containing membranes was homogenized and diluted to 1/180 of the original culture volume in high salt medium II and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was finally homogenized in 1/450 of the original culture volume of high salt medium II, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. For high EGTA conditions, high salt medium II contained 10 mm EGTA instead of 0.1 mm CaCl2 and additionally 4 mm MgCl2 during washing and resuspension steps. For initial screening purpose, membranes were washed under low salt conditions in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and resuspended in 20 mm Mops, 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2. Enzyme activities were also tested on fresh preparations to certify that freezing and thawing did not have any major effects on the activities. Membrane protein concentrations were determined using the bicin-choninic acid protein assay (Sigma-Aldrich) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Enzyme Assays—O2 consumption of isolated membranes was measured at 25 °C using an O2 electrode (Rank Brothers, Cambridge, UK). NAD(P)H oxidation of bacterial membranes was measured at room temperature (21 °C) using an Aminco DW2a or an Olis DW2 Conversion dual wavelength spectrophotometer at 340–400 nm. NAD(P)H and succinate oxidation was measured in medium A (20 mm Mops/KOH, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2). Additions and substrate concentrations were as indicated in the figure legends. When using EGTA at 10 mm, the concentration of Mops in medium A was increased to 100 mm, and CaCl2 was added to 10.5 mm in the assay. Enzyme activities over a range of different pH values were measured in medium B, designed to maintain constant ionic strength. To obtain medium B, solutions of 20 mm of BisTris in 20 mm HCl were mixed with 20 mm triethanolamine in 20 mm KCl to give a certain pH. Medium B additionally contained 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm EGTA. For measurement of NAD(P)H oxidation with decylubiquinone (DcQ) as electron acceptor, 40 μm DcQ, 1 mm KCN, and 120 μm NAD(P)H were added. Student's t tests were performed using Excel (Microsoft). Production of A. thaliana Type II NAD(P)H DHs as T7-tagged Fusion Proteins in E. coli—Plasmids were constructed to contain cDNAs for seven A. thaliana type II NAD(P)H DHs and denoted pET-T7Atnda1, -T7Atnda2, -T7Atndb1, -T7Atndb2, -T7Atndb3, -T7Atndb4, and -T7Atndc1. Gene amplification was done from full-length sequences, except for the lowly expressed NDB3 (8Michalecka A.M. Svensson Å. S. Johansson F.I. Agius S.C. Johanson U. Brennicke A. Binder S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Elhafez D. Murcha M.W. Clifton R. Soole K.L. Day D.A. Whelan J. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which was derived from a partial cDNA clone. It has been reported for yeast NDI1 that only the mature, but not the full-length protein, can be functionally produced with a T7 tag in E. coli (32Kitajima-Ihara T. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Also, when the potato NDA1 polypeptide is imported into mitochondria, N-terminal processing has been observed (40Rasmusson A.G. Svensson Å. S. Knoop V. Grohmann L. Brennicke A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inserts derived from the six full-length A. thaliana cDNAs were designed to lack the parts coding for unconserved N termini and to start at a position aligning to the E. coli NDH-2 start codon. All plasmids were constructed to encode fusion proteins with a T7 tag at the N-terminal end (supplemental Fig. 1). For investigation of Ca2+ binding properties, the different A. thaliana NAD(P)H DHs were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS transformed with the engineered plant genes cloned in pET21a. Gene expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to the growth medium. In total cell lysates the NDB- and NDC-type proteins were visible upon SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie staining (no"
https://openalex.org/W1994554966,"Most physical and biological systems are disordered, even though the majority of theoretical models treat disorder as a weak perturbation. One particularly simple system is a ferromagnet approaching its Curie temperature, T(C), where all of the spins associated with partially filled atomic shells acquire parallel orientation. With the addition of disorder by way of chemical substitution, the Curie point is suppressed, but no qualitatively new phenomena appear in bulk measurements as long as the disorder is truly random on the atomic scale and not so large as to eliminate ferromagnetism entirely. Here we report the discovery that a simply measured magnetic response is singular above the Curie temperature of a model, disordered magnet, and that the associated singularity grows to an anomalous divergence at T(C). The origin of the singular response is the random internal field induced by an external magnetic field transverse to the favoured direction for magnetization. The fact that ferromagnets can be studied easily and with high precision using bulk susceptibility and a large variety of imaging tools will not only advance fundamental studies of the random field problem, but also suggests a mechanism for tuning the strength of domain wall pinning, the key to applications."
https://openalex.org/W2076768116,"The origin of Saturn's narrow G ring has been unclear. We show that it contains a bright arc located 167,495.6 ± 1.3 km from Saturn's center. This longitudinally localized material is trapped in a 7:6 corotation eccentricity resonance with the satellite Mimas. The cameras aboard the Cassini spacecraft mainly observe small (1 to 10 micrometers) dust grains in this region, but a sharp decrease in the flux of energetic electrons measured near this arc requires that it also contain larger (centimeter- to meter-sized) bodies whose total mass is equivalent to that of a ∼100-meter-wide ice-rich moonlet. Collisions into these bodies may generate dust, which subsequently drifts outward to populate the rest of the G ring. Thus, the entire G ring could be derived from an arc of debris held in a resonance with Mimas."
https://openalex.org/W2101180504,"Deficiency of matrix GLA protein (MGP), an inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2/4, is known to cause arterial calcification and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Yet the vascular role of MGP remains poorly understood. To further investigate MGP, we created a new MGP transgenic mouse model with high expression of the transgene in the lungs. The excess MGP led to a disruption of the pulmonary pattern of BMP-4, and resulted in significant morphological defects in the pulmonary artery tree. Specifically, the vascular branching pattern lacked characteristic side branching, whereas control lungs had extensive side branching accounting for as much as 40% of the vascular endothelium. The vascular changes could be explained by a dramatic reduction of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 in the alveolar epithelium, and in epithelial expression of the activin-like kinase receptor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, both critical in vascular formation. Abnormalities were also found in the terminal airways and in lung cell differentiation; high levels of surfactant protein-B were distributed in an abnormal pattern suggesting lost coordination between vasculature and airways. Ex vivo, lung cells from MGP transgenic mice showed higher proliferation, in particular surfactant protein B-expressing cells, and conditioned medium from these cells poorly supported in vitro angiogenesis compared with normal lung cells.

Lack of MGP causes arterial calcification in mice (1Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar) and the human Keutel syndrome, which is due to mutations in the MGP gene (2Hur D.J. Raymond G.V. Kahler S.G. Riegert-Johnson D.L. Cohen B.A. Boyadjiev S.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2005; 135: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The arterial calcification in mice is associated with profound changes in cell differentiation as arterial smooth muscle cells are replaced by chondrocyte-like cells undergoing progressive mineralization (1Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). MGP deficiency also causes peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis and other morphological defects, including nasal hypoplasia and abnormal cartilage and bone calcification (2Hur D.J. Raymond G.V.

Furthermore, alterations in MGP expression has been reported in various tumors including a loss of MGP during progression of lung and colorectal carcinomas (4Bianchi F. Hu J. Pelosi G. Cirincione R.

Schmitt A.O. Pilarsky C. Hinzmann B. Weiss B. Rosenthal A. Thierauch K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2820-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Previous work by our group and others has suggested that MGP can act as an inhibitory morphogen, acting antagonistically to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-2 and -4 (7Zebboudj A.F. Imura M. Bostrom K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Garfinkel A. Tintut Y. Petrasek D. Bostrom K. Demer L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 2006; 281: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our previous studies also showed close links between BMP-4, MGP, the activin-like kinase receptor 1 (ALK1), a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor essential in vascular formation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (9Yao Y. Zebboudj A.F. Shao E. Perez M. Bostrom K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). BMP-4 stimulated expression of the ALK1 receptor in vascular endothelial cells, which when activated, enhanced expression of MGP and VEGF. Stimulation of the BMP receptors as well as ALK1 is known to activate the SMAD signaling system by phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8, whereas stimulation of the TGF-β receptor ALK5 causes phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 (10Goumans M.J. Lebrin F. Valdimarsdottir G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, the role of MGP in vascular biology is far from clear. Here, we report that a newly generated human MGP transgenic mouse suffers severe morphological defects in the pulmonary artery tree, which can be explained by considering BMP-4 and MGP as an activating and inhibitory vascular morphogen, respectively, in the developing lung vasculature. Specifically, we show that in the transgenic mouse, the branching pattern in the developing lung vasculature lack characteristic side branching, whereas the control mouse has extensive side branching. We found that excess MGP disrupted the distribution of BMP-4 in the lung tissue, and caused a significant reduction in phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8, and in epithelial expression of ALK1 and VEGF. The abnormal vascular development was associated with abnormal morphology and cell differentiation in the terminal airways. Recent work has explored the role of morphogens in the creation of branching pattern formation (11Nelson C.M. Vanduijn M.M. Inman J.L. Fletcher D.A. Bissell M.J. Science. 2006; 314: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). We present evidence, based on a computational model of the process, that MGP acts in lung vascular development as an inhibitory morphogen, acting antagonistically to BMP-4 in an activator/inhibitor reaction-diffusion dynamic system. It provides a mechanistic explanation for the specific lack of side branching in the MGP transgenic mouse, and strengthens the claim that morphogen interactions and dynamics play an important role in the morphogenesis of branched structures. Generation and Identification of Mice Transgenic for Human MGP—Transgenic mice were generated using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) as previously described (12Marshall V.M. Allison J. Templeton T. Foote S.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 256: 159-182PubMed Google Scholar). The study had been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Los Angeles. The BAC clone containing the human mgp gene (Invitrogen), was digested by BsrFI, and the DNA fragment containing the mgp gene was purified using a QIAEX II kit (Qiagen). The purified fragment contained 18.5-kb upstream and 10.5-kb downstream DNA sequences of the mgp gene. The DNA was injected into the pronuclei of C57BL/6 mouse eggs at a concentration of 3 ng/μl. Noon of the day of injection was defined as 0.5 days post coitus. The genotype was determined by PCR analysis of genomic DNA, extracted from the mouse tails. Two primer pairs specific for the human mgp gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_000900) were used. The first primer pair spanned the 5′-junction of exon I (5′-CCAGAGCAGCATCCTGTGTA-3′ and 5′-GAACCAGTGGGAGAGAGCTG-3′) and resulted in a 159-bp product. The second primer pair spanned the 3′-junction of exon IV (5′-GCTCTAAGCCTGTCCACGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTGCTACAGGGGGATACAA-3′) and resulted in a 201-bp product. PCR thermocycling parameters for the genomic DNA were 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissues or cultured cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Real time PCR assays were performed as previously described (9Yao Y. Zebboudj A.F. Shao E. Perez M. Bostrom K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The following primers and probes were used: human MGP (hMGP) forward, 5′-GGGAAGCCTGTGATGACTACAGA-3′, hMGP reverse (5′-CGATTATAGGCAGCATTGTATCCA-3′; hMGP TaqMan probe, FAMTTGCGAACGCTACGCCATGGTTT-TAMRA; mouse MGP (mMGP) forward, 5′-CCTCTGGCCATCCTGGCT-3′, mMGP reverse, 5′-TCCATGCTTTCGTGAGATTCG-3′; mMGP TaqMan probe, FAM-CGCTGGCCGTGGCACCC-TAMRA, combined mouse and human MGP (cMGP) forward, 5′-CCTTCATTAACAGGAGAAATG-3′, cMGP reverse, 5′-CTCTCTTGGGCTTTAGCTC-3′; cMGP TaqMan probe, FAM-ATGTCCCCTCAGCAGAGATGG-TAMRA; mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGAPDH) forward, 5′-CATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCT-3′, mGAPDH reverse, 5′-GGTTTCTCCAGGCGGCA-3′;, mGAPDH TaqMan probe, FAM-CCCAATGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-TAMRA; human activin-like kinase receptor 1 (hALK1) forward, 5′-AGGGCAAACCAGCCATTG-3′, hALK1 reverse, 5′-GGTTGCTCTTGACCAGCACAT-3′; hALK1 TaqMan probe, FAM-CACCGCGACTTCAAGAGCCGC-TAMRA; mouse vascular endothelial growth factor (mVEGF) forward, 5′-TGAAGCCTGGAGTGCGT-3′, mVEGF reverse, 5′-AGGTTTGATCCGCATGATCTG-3′; and TaqMan probe, FAM-CCCACGTCAGAGAGCAACATCACCA-TAMRA. The primer and probes for mouse BMP-2 and BMP-4 were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Visualization of Lung Vasculature—Corrosion casting of the pulmonary arteries was performed at 1 month of age as previously described (13Hossler F.E. Douglas J.E. Microsc. Microanal. 2001; 7: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using a pressure of 15 mm Hg through the right ventricle. Tissue was removed by maceration in 20% KOH for 2 days. The casts were cleaned in formic acid and distilled water. Lungs were photographed at E15.5, and to optimize visualization of the vasculature, the images were sharpened in NIH Image J (imagejdocu.tudor.lu) using a 3-point moving average algorithm, with weights (-1,12,-1) in both X and Y directions. Immunohistochemistry—The lung tissues were collected from MGP transgenic and wild type embryos on embryonic day (E) 18.5. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (14Yao Y. Zebboudj A.F. Torres A. Shao E. Bostrom K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Specific antibodies to MGP were obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. Antibodies to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1, CD31, a marker for the endothelial cell population (15Ng Y.S. Rohan R. Sunday M.E. Demello D.E. D'Amore P.A. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)), VEGF, ALK1, BMP-4, P-SMAD2/3, and total SMAD were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to surfactant protein (SP) B were from Upstate, and antibodies to P-SMAD1/5/8 were from Cell Signaling. Permeabilization of the tissue with 0.1 mg/ml of Proteinase K for 15 min was performed prior to immunohistochemistry using the ALK1 antibody. ABC reagents (Vector Laboratories) were used to detect antibody binding. Eosin was used for counterstaining. Cy3 donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for immunofluorescence to visualize binding of anti-BMP-4 antibodies. Controls with no primary antibody showed no fluorescence labeling. Images were acquired using a Nikon Labo-phot-2 microscope, a Nikon FX-35DX camera, and SPOT imaging software, version 4.0.1. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (9Yao Y. Zebboudj A.F. Shao E. Perez M. Bostrom K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from whole tissue extracts were used. Blots were incubated with specific antibodies to SP-B (4 μg/ml; Upstate), BMP-4 (4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (2.5 μg/ml; Sigma), PECAM-1 (0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), aquaporin-5 (5 μg/ml; Calbiochem), Clara cell-specific protein (CCSP) (1:2000 dilution; Upstate), β-actin (1:5000 dilution; Sigma), and VEGF (0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Densitometry using NIH Image J was performed to compare the relative protein levels after normalization to β-actin. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from VEC Technologies (Rensselaer, NY) and cultured as previously described (9Yao Y. Zebboudj A.F. Shao E. Perez M. Bostrom K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A549 cells (American Type Cell Collection) and mice lung cells (prepared as per below) were cultured in Ham's F12K medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm). Recombinant human BMP-4 (R&D Systems) was added at the time of plating of the cells. Cell Analysis by Flow Cytometry—To determine the percentage of PECAM-1 positive lungs cells in transgenic and wild type lungs, the lungs were carefully removed from sacrificed mice and filled with Liberase (0.2 mg/ml; Roche) and DNase (0.1 mg/ml; Roche) in 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution. The filled, tied off lungs were agitated in small vials for 20 min at 37 °C in the Liberase/DNase solution. After incubation, the vial was vigorously shaken until the content was homogenous, about 30 s. The suspension was washed 4 times by adding 50 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution and letting the suspension settle for 4 min on ice before the supernatant was removed, leaving 15-20 ml. The suspension was centrifuged for 1-2 min at 300 × g, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. One ml of the final cell suspension was incubated with anti-PECAM-1 antibodies (4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit antibodies (0.75 μg/ml) were used for detection of PECAM-1. Cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed by Cell Quest software package (both from BD Biosciences). A minimum of 15,000 cells was analyzed per sample. Gates based on forward and side scatter were set to eliminate cellular debris and cell clusters. Cultured BAEC stained with anti-PECAM-1 antibodies were used as positive control cells. Disaggregated lung cells were also used for proliferation assays. An equal number of total lung cells were cultured as above. Cell proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation after 4 days as previously described (14Yao Y. Zebboudj A.F. Torres A. Shao E. Bostrom K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Tube Formation Assays—Matrigel™ matrix (BD Biosciences) was diluted 1:3 in EC medium and 300 μl was added per well in 12-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow polymerization. BAEC were suspended in medium that had been conditioned on disaggregated lung cells for 4 days. The BAEC were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well, in 400 μl of conditioned medium, and incubated for up to 48 h. Statistics—Data were analyzed for statistical significance by analysis of variance with post hoc Scheffe's analysis, unless otherwise stated. The analyses were performed using StatView, version 4.51 (Abacus Concepts). All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Computational Model—We used a model based on reaction-diffusion partial differential equations, following the work of Meinhardt (16Meinhardt H. Differentiation. 1976; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The model postulates four variables, which may be thought of as concentrations continuously distributed over a two-dimensional domain (x, y): activator concentration A(x, y), inhibitor concentration H(x, y), substrate concentration S(x, y), and a marker for cell differentiation Y(x, y). We proposed specific identities for these variables: the activator A is BMP-4, the inhibitor H is MGP, the substrate S is the ALK1-TGF-β complex, and the marker variable Y represents the presence of a differentiated vascular cell. (Y = 1 means the cell is differentiated.) The equations are as shown below. ∂A∂t=cA2SH=μA+DA∇2A+ρAY(Eq. 1) ∂H∂t=cA2S−νH+DH∇2H+ρHY(Eq. 2) ∂S∂t=c0−γS−ϵYS+Ds∇2S(Eq. 3) ∂Y∂t=dA−eY+Y2(1+fY2)(Eq. 4) Here, the activator A is produced autocatalytically in a process requiring S and inhibited by H, is degraded at a rate μ and is produced by differentiated cells Y at a rate ρA. It also diffuses, at a rate DA. The inhibitor H is produced by activator A in a process requiring S, degraded at a rate ψ, and produced by differentiated cells at a rate ρH. It is this parameter ρH, modeling the rate of MGP production by differentiated vascular cells that we will increase to model the effects of the MGP transgenic mouse. H also diffuses, at a rate DH. Substrate, S, is supplied at a rate c0, degrades at a rate γ, is taken up by differentiated cells Y at a rate ϵ, and diffuses at a rate DS. Last, Y is a marker of differentiation: it is increased by the presence of A, degrades at a rate e, and sigmoidally increases from 0 to 1, representing commitment to differentiation. The model was simulated in a 200 × 200 grid using Matlab code (available on request) that implemented a finite-difference scheme using a forward Euler method for the reaction part and a second-order four-point Laplacian for the diffusion operator. We used no-flux boundary conditions throughout. Parameter Values—The values used are: Δx = 0.25, Δt = 0.0045; DA = 0.02, DH = 0.18, DS = 0.06; c = 0.0025, c0 = 0.002; μ = 0.12, γ = 0.02, ϵ = 0.02, d = 0.0033, e = 0.1, f = 10; ρA = 0.03, ψ = 0.04; ρH = 0.0001 or 0.0003. Characterization of the MGP Transgenic Mouse—To elucidate the role of MGP during development and morphogenesis, we generated transgenic mice for MGP on C57BL/6J back-ground. We used a 33-kb BAC clone containing the human mgp (hmgp) gene (Fig. 1A) to allow the human MGP (hMGP) promoter to drive expression. No other genes except the MGP gene were included in the BAC clone. We obtained five transgenics, all male, expressing the hmgp transgene, which was verified by real time PCR with specific primers spanning intron-exon junctions of exons 1 and 4 of hMGP (Fig. 1B). Three transgenic lines with high hmgp transgene expression (Fig. 1B) were selected for further studies. Studies of the two mice with low MGP expression were not pursued because one was chimeric and did not generate offspring, and the second had a truncated BAC clone. The distribution of hMGP expression was compared with that of mMGP on E18.5 and at 1 month of age using real time PCR with species-specific primers. In both cases, the highest MGP expression was found in the lungs (Fig. 1C). There was increased perinatal mortality of heterozygous hMGP transgenic mice (MGPtg/wt), resulting in a decrease of the ratio of MGPtg/wt mice to total mice from 0.4 prenatally to 0.25 in adult mice (Fig. 1D). The deaths usually occurred within minutes to a few hours after birth. Furthermore, females had a higher lethality than males, resulting in an increase of the male to female ratio among MGPtg/wt mice from 0.75 prenatally to 1.6 in adult mice (Fig. 1E). The higher lethality of female MGPtg/wt mice led to difficulties in obtaining homozygous MGPtg/tg mice. Because the phenotype was apparent in MGPtg/wt mice, these were used for characterization and the results from the three MGPtg/tg mice were incorporated when available (see Fig. 5, B-D).FIGURE 5Expression of MGP, BMP-4, ALK1, and VEGF in wild type and MGP transgenic lungs at E18.5. Pulmonary expression of MGP (A), BMP-4 (B), ALK1 (C), and VEGF (D) in wild type and MGP transgenic lungs at E18.5 as determined by real time PCR (n = 8 in each group for MGP and BMP-4; n = 6 in each group for ALK1 and VEGF) (right panels) and immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence (middle panels).

The movements of the transgenic pups were normal, suggesting that the peripheral nervous system was normal. Furthermore, we examined the skeletal development in transgenic and wild type littermates because MGP is expressed in developing bones (1Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). However, cleared skeletal preparations did not reveal any major skeletal defects and histochemical stains did not reveal significant differences in the growth plates in the MGP transgenic (data not shown). Furthermore, palates and tracheae were without obvious abnormalities (data not shown). Contrary to MGP-deficient aorta, which are calcified at 3 weeks of age (1Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar), histochemical stains did not reveal any abnormalities in the MGP transgenic aorta at 1 month of age (data not shown). Effect of the MGP Transgene on Airways and Pulmonary Cell Differentiation—MGP has been implicated in lung development, and the MGP transgene was highly expressed in the lungs. We examined the airways at E18.5, but were unable to distinguish significant differences in the airways by serial histological sectioning (Fig. 2A). However, at 1 month of age, the transgenic lungs were larger and buoyant in normal saline, and microscopic examination of the terminal airways revealed terminal air sacs that were more closely spaced and tube-like compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 2B). We hypothesized that the changes in airway morphology might be associated with changes in pulmonary cell differentiation, and analyzed molecular markers for pulmonary cells. Our results showed an increase in SP-B, a marker for type II epithelial cells (17Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), at E18.5 and 1 month of age, as determined by immunoblotting (E18.5 shown in Fig. 2C, left). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the distribution of SP-B was significantly altered in transgenic lungs. In normal lungs, SP-B was expressed mostly in the alveolar epithelium, whereas in transgenic lungs, it was spread throughout the epithelium and the mesenchyme (E18.5 shown in Fig. 2C, right) reflecting the abnormal airway morphology. We were unable to detect significant differences for aquaporin-5, a marker for type I epithelial cells (18Funaki H. Yamamoto T. Koyama Y. Kondo D. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Kobayashi H. Sawaguchi S. Abe H. Kihara I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1151-C1157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or CCSP, a marker for bronchial epithelial cells (19Margraf L.R. Finegold M.J. Stanley L.A. Major A. Hawkins H.K. DeMayo F.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as determined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting (data not shown). Effect of the MGP Transgene on Vascular Growth and Branching—We then hypothesized that the pulmonary vasculature may be abnormal in association with the abnormal airways. Gross dissection of the lungs showed an overall decrease in pulmonary vascularization in MGP transgenic mice compared with wild type littermates, apparent at 1 month of age (Fig. 3A). Visualization of the pulmonary arteries in the transgenics using corrosion casting showed two main vascular trunks and a severe lack of small vessels and side branches when compared with wild type (Fig. 3B). We also examined the effect on endothelial cell differentiation by FACS sorting of disaggregated lung cells and immunohistochemistry using antibodies to PECAM-1, a marker for the endothelial cell population (15Ng Y.S. Rohan R. Sunday M.E. Demello D.E. D'Amore P.A. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The percentage of PECAM-1 positive lung cells decreased by 40%, from 10.2 ± 0.04 to 6.2 ± 0.4% in transgenic lungs (Fig. 3C). The results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (data not shown), and consistent with a decrease in overall vessel formation. Pulmonary expression of MGP starts to increase after E14 (20Gilbert K.A. Rannels S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1179-L1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which coincides with an exponential increase in vascular networks (21Schachtner S.K. Wang Y. Baldwin S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To examine if a branching defect led to the abnormal vasculature in the MGP transgenics, we examined the pulmonary vessels in non-perfused E15.5 and E18.5 embryos. The results revealed a qualitative change in vascular branching, best seen in E15.5 where individual vessels easily could be distinguished. Normal embryos had vascular trees with both two-pronged tip-branching and abundant side branches (Fig. 4, top and bottom right), whereas transgenic vascular trees had retained the tip branching but lacked the side branching (Fig. 4, middle and bottom right), resulting in a sparser network. We determined the number of visible branch points per lower lung field in MGP transgenic and wild type embryos. The results showed that the number of branch points was reduced by 63% compared with wild type (Fig. 4, bottom). Altered BMP-4 Distribution in MGP Transgenic Lungs—Because MGP is known to inhibit BMP-4 (9Yao Y. Zebboudj A.F. Shao E. Perez M. Bostrom K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and BMP-4 is a key factor in the regulation of the pulmonary development, we hypothesized that excess MGP affected pulmonary BMP-4 and diminished its activity. To determine expression and distribution of MGP and BMP-4, we examined lungs from E18.5 using real time PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Total MGP mRNA expression was increased 2.4-6.6-fold (3.8 ± 1.8) (n = 8) in the MGP heterozygous"
https://openalex.org/W1996111102,"Integrins mediate cell adhesion in response to activation signals that trigger conformational changes within their ectodomain. It is thought that a compact bent conformation of the molecule represents its physiological low affinity state and extended conformations its active state. We have determined the structure of two integrin fragments of the β2 subunit. The first structure, consisting of the plexin-semaphorin-integrin domain, hybrid, integrin-epidermal growth factor 1 (I-EGF1), and I-EGF2 domains (PHE2), showed an L-shaped conformation with the bend located between the I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 domains. The second structure, which includes, in addition, the I-EGF3 domain, showed an extended conformation. The major reorientation of I-EGF2 with respect to the other domains in the two structures is accompanied by a change of torsion angle of the disulfide bond between Cys<sup>461</sup>-Cys<sup>492</sup> by 180° and the conversion of a short α-helix (residues Ser<sup>468</sup>-Cys<sup>475</sup>) into a flexible coil. Based on the PHE2 structure, we introduced a disulfide bond between the plexin-semaphorin-integrin domain and I-EGF2 domains in the β2 subunit. The resultant αLβ2 integrin (leukocyte function-associated antigen-1) variant was locked in a bent state and could not be detected with the monoclonal antibody KIM127 in Mg<sup>2+</sup>/EGTA. However, it retained the binding activity to ICAM-1. These results provide a structural hypothesis for our understanding of the transition between the resting and active states of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1."
https://openalex.org/W2037341607,"Recent investigations suggest that functions of the proapoptotic BCL2 family members, including BAD, are not limited to regulation of apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that BAD inhibits G1 to S phase transition in MCF7 breast cancer cells independent of apoptosis. BAD overexpression inhibited G1 transit and cell growth as well as cyclin D1 expression. Inhibition of cyclin D1 expression was mediated through inhibition of transcription activated by AP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that BAD is localized at the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element (TRE) and cAMP-response element (CRE) in the cyclin D1 promoter. This was shown to reflect direct binding interactions of BAD with c-Jun, and this interaction inhibited the activity of AP1 complexes at TRE. BAD did not interact with phosphorylated forms of c-Jun. Our data suggest that inhibitory TRE/CRE-c-Jun-BAD complexes are present at the cyclin D1 promoter in quiescent cells. Estrogen stimulation displaced BAD from TRE/CRE elements in MCF7 cells, whereas BAD overexpression inhibited estrogen-induced cyclin D1 synthesis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of endogenous BAD in MCF7 cells markedly increased the proliferative fraction and DNA synthesis, activated Cdks, and increased cyclin D1 protein levels. This action of BAD required serine residues Ser75 and Ser99. Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of BAD localized to the nuclei of human breast epithelial cells. Thus, we demonstrate a novel role for BAD in cell cycle regulation dependent upon its phosphorylation state and independent of the BAD/BCL2 interaction and apoptosis.

Thus, we demonstrate a novel role for BAD in cell cycle regulation dependent upon its phosphorylation state and independent of the BAD/BCL2 interaction and apoptosis. Recent studies on BCL2 family proteins suggest that members of the proapoptotic arm have functions distinct from apoptosis induction. BID has been shown to have a role in the DNA damage response (1Zinkel S.S. Hurov K.E. Ong C. Abtahi F.M. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and BAX and BID take part in homologous recombination (2Dumay A. Laulier C. Bertrand P. Saintigny Y. Lebrun F. Vayssiere J.L. Lopez B.S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A prosurvival role for BAD was demonstrated in murine neuronal cells (2Dumay A.

Growth regulation by BCL2 family proteins has been previously reported, although the mechanisms are poorly defined (4Crescenzi E. Palumbo G. Gynecol.

BAD is devoid of the membrane-anchoring hydrophobic region present in most other BCL2 proteins and it resides primarily in the cytoplasm. Under apoptotic conditions, BAD is found in the mitochondria, binding to BCL2 and BCLxl (7Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 8Kelekar A. Chang B.S. Harlan J.E. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell.

Cell survival signals induce inhibitory phosphorylation of BAD on Ser75 and Ser99 (murine Ser112 and Ser136, respectively) and promote its sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins. This mechanism obliterates the inhibitory effects of BAD on prosurvival BCLxl/BCL2 (9Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). We previously showed in MCF7 breast cancer epithelial cells that estradiol inhibits apoptosis by inducing phosphorylation of BAD (10Fernando R.I. Wimalasena J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3266-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and a role for BAD in regulating apoptosis in murine breast epithelial cells has been described in vivo (9Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). In our studies, we consistently observed that mere overexpression of BAD in MCF7 cells did not cause apoptosis; rather there was an enhanced response once the cells were exposed to an apoptotic stimulus. This suggests levels of regulation between cytoplasmic BAD and its binding and inhibition of BCL2/BCLxL in mitochondria. Similar to our work in MCF7 cells, studies in BAD knock-out mice demonstrated the importance of BAD in survival promotion by growth factors (9Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cleavage of long form BAD to a short form was required for its apoptotic role (3Seo S.Y. Chen Y.B. Ivanovska I. Ranger A.M. Hong S.J. Dawson V.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Bellows D.S. Fannjiang Y. Hardwick J.M. J. Biol.

In our previous study (10Fernando R.I. Wimalasena J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3266-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in unpublished work, 4R. Fernando and J. Wimalasena, unpublished data. we observed that some portion of BAD localizes in the nucleus and that BAD overexpression led to decreased cell proliferation. In this study, we have studied in detail the cell cycle regulation of MCF7 cells by BAD. This cell line has been utilized as the premier model of hormone-sensitive (estrogen receptor-positive) breast cancer by many laboratories, including our own. In MCF7 cells, cyclin D1 has a rate-limiting role in G1-S phase transition (11Altucci L. Addeo R. Cicatiello L. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Truss M. Beato M. Sica V. Bresciani F. Weisz A.

Our data strongly suggest that cyclin D1 is an important target of the inhibitory cell cycle effects of BAD. We also show that the dual phosphorylation site mutant of BAD (dmBAD), 5The abbreviations used are: dmBADdual phosphorylation site mutant of BADTettetracyclineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation assayRNAiRNA interferencewtBADwild type BADE2estradiolCREBcAMP-response element-binding protein. with mutations at S75A and S99A, is ineffective in many aspects of cell cycle regulation, suggesting a requirement for phosphorylation at these residues, which are also targets of prosurvival mechanisms. Accordingly, the BH3 domain deletion mutant and the S91A mutant of BAD, both of which carry intact Ser75 and Ser99 residues, exerted cell cycle-inhibitory effects similar to that of wild type BAD. dual phosphorylation site mutant of BAD tetracycline electrophoretic mobility shift assay chromatin immunoprecipitation assay RNA interference wild type BAD estradiol cAMP-response element-binding protein. Collectively, our data suggest that BAD may act to prevent tumor growth both via proapoptotic mechanisms and by anti-proliferative actions of its phosphorylated, apoptotically “inactive” form. Given the importance of cyclin D1 in proliferation of many tumor cells, regulation of cyclin D1 levels by BAD may have a crucial role in cell cycle control. Selectively increasing BAD expression in breast cancer cells may lead to decreased tumor growth in vivo. Cell Culture and Transfections—MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin G, and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen). FLAG-BAD (human) vectors were donated by Dr. H. G. Wang (17Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the BH3 domain-deleted mutant was a gift from Dr. A. Kelekar (8Kelekar A. Chang B.S. Harlan J.E. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7040-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The luciferase construct of AP1/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-response element (TRE) is a gift from Dr. B. Dibling (18Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Where necessary, MCF7 and MCF7/BAD cells were arrested in G1 by total serum withdrawal for 2 days. Expression of various BAD mutants was verified by immunoblotting with BAD and/or FLAG antibodies. Establishment of MCF7/BAD Cells—MCF7 cells stably transfected with tetracycline (Tet)-regulated BAD expression plasmid were generated in two steps. The cells were first transfected with pTet-tTAK (Invitrogen), modified to contain the puromycin resistance gene, using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Selection was performed with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) in the presence of 1 μg/ml Tet. A clone showing high Tet-controlled transactivator tTA induction upon Tet withdrawal and low basal activity was selected by using the pUHC13-3 control plasmid (Invitrogen). BAD that was N-terminally fused to the FLAG epitope was cloned into the pBI-EGFP plasmid (Clontech). The construct was then transfected into the previously described Tet-regulated clone together with a neomycin resistance plasmid, and selection was performed with 700 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Clones showing expression of GFP in the absence of Tet were isolated and analyzed for expression of FLAG-BAD by Western blot. Several individual clones of MCF7/BAD cells were used in this study. Inhibition of BAD Expression—siRNA for human BAD (5′-GAAGGGACUUCCUCGCCCGTT-3′, 5′-CGGGCGAGGAAGUCCCUUCTT-3′) (catalog number 6471; Cell Signal Technology) and control siRNA (5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGATT-3′, 5′-UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGTT) (catalog number 6201) were transfected at a final concentration of 33 nm using RNAifect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The TRE and control oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gels were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (catalog number E3300; Promega). DNA binding reactions were carried out using 50 μg of nuclear extract (prepared as described in the supplemental materials), radiolabeled probe, and gel shift binding buffer with the relevant volume of nuclease-free water. At the end of the incubation period, reactions were resolved on nondenaturing acrylamide gels and dried, and autoradiograms were obtained. Reporter Assay—AP1/TRE-luciferase and cyclin D1-luciferase constructs (19Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) were transfected into MCF7 and T47D cells. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1× reporter lysis buffer (catalog number E3971; Promega) on ice for 10 min. Supernatant was collected after brief centrifugation (12,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C). One hundred micrograms of cell lysate was assayed with 100 μl of luciferase assay substrate (catalog number E4030; Promega), and light emission was measured using a scintillation counter. To equalize levels of luciferase vector transfection, pEGFPN1 (Clontech) was co-transfected, and EGFP levels were analyzed by Western blotting. Metabolic Labeling with [35S]Methionine—Cells were cysteine/methionine-deprived for 1 h (methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12) and labeled with 75 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (MP Biomedical) in the same medium as indicated. Labeling medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed, and proteins were immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts, resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and visualized by autoradiography. Intensity of the band denotes the amount of [35S]methionine incorporated within the labeling period (20Foster J.S. Henley D.C. Bukovsky A. Seth P. Wimalasena J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR and Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was extracted from MCF7/BAD cells (Tet+ or Tet-) using Perfect RNA (Eppendorf). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer's protocol (iScript; Bio-Rad). The synthesized cDNA was then added to a 25-μl PCR mixture (REDTaq ReadyMix PCR mixture; Sigma) with each set of gene-specific primers: cyclin D1, forward (5′-atggaacaccagctcctgtgctgc-3′) and reverse (5′-tcagatgtccacgtcccgcaCGt-3′); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward (5′-gggctgcttttaactctggt-3′) and reverse (5′-tggcaggtttttctagacgg-3′). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows. Initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 25-30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The final PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and photographed under UV light. Northern blotting for cyclin D1 was carried out as in Ref. 21Foster J.S. Henley D.C. Ahamed S. Wimalasena J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 320-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—ChIP analysis was performed following a protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) with modifications. MCF7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-stripped dextran serum for 3 days. Upon estradiol (100 nm) stimulation for 45 min, the cells were cross-linked using 1.1% formaldehyde buffer containing 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA-Na (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EGTA-Na, Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors and lysed by warm 1% SDS lysis buffer and incubated for 10 min on ice. Cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp, and these samples were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer. Lysates were precleared with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose 50% slurry (Upstate Biologicals) for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation and chromatin immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using 4 μg of anti-BAD (Upstate Biologicals). Rabbit IgG (negative control) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose slurry (60 μl) was added for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation to collect the antibody-protein complex and washed extensively following the manufacturer's protocol. Input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links. After proteinase K digestion for 1 h, DNA was extracted using Qiagen spin column kit. Precipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR for human cyclin D1 promoter using following primers: AP1, sense (5′-CTGCCTTCCTACCTTGACCA-3′) and antisense (5′-TGAAGGGACGTCTACACCCC-3′); cAMP response element (CRE), sense (5′-GCCCCCCTCCCGCTCCCATT-3′) and antisense (5′-TGGGGCTCTTCCTGGGCAGC-3′). Statistical Methods—Analyses were done using GraphPad Prism version 4. Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance blocked by experiment, and treatment means were compared within times using pairwise contrasts at the 5% significance level. Other Methods—DNA synthesis was assayed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation according to the manufacturer's instructions (catalog number 559619; BD Pharmingen). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assays, DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, microscopic analysis of cells, Western blotting, subcellular fractionation, flow cytometry analysis, and in vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (10Fernando R.I. Wimalasena J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3266-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Foster J.S. Henley D.C. Bukovsky A. Seth P. Wimalasena J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and details are provided in the supplement. BAD Inhibits Cell Growth and S Phase Entry in MCF7—We previously demonstrated that BAD is one target of estrogen-induced cell survival in MCF7 cells and that transient overexpression of BAD does not result in apoptosis in these cells under normal growth conditions (10Fernando R.I. Wimalasena J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3266-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In our subsequent studies, a noticeably slow growth rate was observed in MCF7 cells overexpressing BAD. MCF7 cells have been used by numerous investigators as a tissue culture model to identify molecules regulating cell growth and apoptosis in hormone-responsive breast cancer. In the present study, we investigated in detail the growth characteristics of MCF7 cells with varying levels of BAD expression. We generated a cell line (MCF7/BAD) that conditionally expresses BAD under a Tet-regulated promoter to complement the results obtained by transient overexpression. Both methods yielded similar results. Withdrawal of Tet for 48-72 h elevated the BAD protein level without eliciting apoptosis, as measured by cytoplasmic cytochrome C content and DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for up to 96 h (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). These cells accumulated at G1 phase of the cell cycle, reflective of inhibited S phase entry (Fig. 1C). Note that BAD did not change the sub-G1 fraction, confirming the absence of apoptotic effects. Cell growth in asynchronous cultures was assayed using MTT uptake (Fig. 1D). BAD overexpression for 120 h suppressed cell growth by 50-60% relative to control cells. Note that in BAD-overexpressing (Tet-) cells, there was no net growth between 72 and 120 h, in contrast to uninduced (Tet+) cells, where continued proliferation was observed (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 1A). Growth suppression elicited by elevated BAD (Tet- 48 h) could be significantly (p = 0.0002) reversed by ending BAD overexpression through the readdition of Tet to the culture medium. Induced cultures (Tet-) stop proliferating by 96 h, whereas cultures where Tet was readded (Tet-/Tet+) continue to proliferate through 120 h. (supplemental Fig. 1A shows statistical analyses of data used for the graph). Clearly, once BAD overexpression has culminated, these cells are able to proliferate. This supports our previous observations that transient overexpression of BAD, by itself, does not induce apoptosis in MCF7 cells (10Fernando R.I. Wimalasena J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3266-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Collectively, the data indicate that BAD may regulate cycle progression in MCF7 cells. Importantly, this effect of BAD is independent of apoptosis and is reversible. BAD Alters Expression and Activity of Cell Cycle Proteins, Including Cyclin D1—To further understand the cell cycle effects of BAD, the expression and activities of critical cell cycle molecules were assayed in conjunction with enforced BAD overexpression or inhibition of endogenous BAD in MCF7 cells. Decreased cyclin D1 protein levels and hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) at serine 780 were consistently detected in cells expressing increased levels of BAD (Fig. 2A, time points in duplicate and histogram reflecting results from several experiments). Initial (24-48 h) reduction in pRB phosphorylation is possibly due to decreased cyclin D1-Cdk4 activity, since pRB phosphorylation at serine 780 is specific for Cdk4 (22Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The sustained decrease in pRB phosphorylation may also reflect decreased Cdk2- and cyclin B-associated Cdk1 activity (supplemental Fig. 2A). We should note that BAD induction does not completely abolish Cdk activities at 48-72 h, in particular that of Cdk2 (supplemental Fig. 2A). Residual Cdk activities may explain the increase in viable cells between 48 and 72 h (Tet- in Fig. 1D). Cyclin D1 governs cell cycle entry and is rate-limiting for G1-S transition in MCF7 cells (11Altucci L. Addeo R. Cicatiello L. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Truss M. Beato M. Sica V. Bresciani F. Weisz A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2315-2324PubMed Google Scholar, 12Foster J.S. Wimalasena J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the inhibition of G1-S transition by elevated BAD expression (Fig. 1C) might result at least partly from the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. In BAD-overexpressing cells, reduction in cyclin D1 protein between 48 and 72 h is accompanied by a clear reduction in cyclin D1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). Regulation of cyclin D1 expression in response to estrogen and other mitogens is primarily transcriptional (11Altucci L. Addeo R. Cicatiello L. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Truss M. Beato M. Sica V. Bresciani F. Weisz A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2315-2324PubMed Google Scholar), although translational regulation has also been described (23Campo P.A. Das S. Hsiang C.H. Bui T. Samuel C.E. Straus D.S. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 409-420PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of de novo synthesis of cyclin D1 by metabolic labeling in asynchronously growing MCF7/BAD indicated that cyclin D1 protein synthesis was significantly lower than in control cells (Fig. 2C), whereas dmBAD had no effect on cyclin D1 synthesis (supplemental Fig. 2C). These results suggest that a critical effect of BAD in regulating S phase entry is the inhibition of cyclin D1 synthesis contributing to G1 blockade. BAD RNA Interference (RNAi) Enhances Cell Cycle Transit and Cyclin D1 Expression—Inhibition of endogenous BAD expression with specific siRNA (but not control siRNA) treatment increased DNA synthesis (Fig. 3A) and activated Cdk2 and Cdk1 (supplemental Fig. 2B). Inhibition of BAD expression also increased levels of cyclin D1 (Fig. 3, B and C) significantly. Inhibition of endogenous BAD did not, however, result in any apparent change in expression of other BCL2 family proteins (Fig. 3B), demonstrating the specificity of the BAD RNAi. Thus, inhibition of endogenous BAD expression produced effects exactly opposite to that of enforced BAD overexpression in MCF7 cells. BAD Regulates the Cyclin D1 Promoter—Given the results in Figs. 2 and 3, we suspected that BAD may regulate cyclin D1 transcription. Experiments with human cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase constructs demonstrated that BAD overexpression strongly repressed transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter in proliferating cells (Fig. 4A). Expression of dmBAD, on the other hand, did not influence cyclin D1 promoter activities. In G1-arrested cells, the cyclin D1 promoter activity was very low and not further affected by the presence of BAD. The inability of dmBAD to inhibit either cyclin D1 promoter activity or the synthesis of cyclin D1 protein suggests that the cell cycle-regulatory effect of BAD depends on phosphorylation of Ser75 and Ser99 residues. AP1-responsive sites in the cyclin D1 promoter, such as AP1/TRE and CRE are important for activation of this promoter in estrogen receptor α-positive cells (24Watanabe G. Howe A. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Shu I.W. Karnezis A.N. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Rundell K. Pestell R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12861-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25Liu M.M. Albanese C. Anderson C.M. Hilty K. Webb P. Uht R.M. Price R.H. Pestell R.G. Kushner P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24353-24360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 promoter constructs encoding mutant forms of either TRE or CRE, linked to the luciferase gene, were transfected as before. Co-transfection of BAD failed to suppress cyclin D1 promoter when either of these sites are singly mutated (Fig. 4B). The activity of the TRE/CRE double mutant of cyclin D1 promoter was very low in MCF7 and was not affected by co-expression of wtBAD (data not shown). To confirm these results, we performed ChIP assays, which identify proteins bound to specific motifs in DNA. DNA in BAD antibody immunoprecipitates from MCF7 cells was PCR-amplified with primers encompassing TRE and CRE sites in the human cyclin D1 promoter, as indicated in the schematic. BAD antibodies, but not controls, clearly precipitated DNA encompassing the cyclin D1 promoter including the TRE and to a lesser extent the CRE (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that in the cyclin D1 natural promoter, the effect of BAD is mediated through these two elements. DNA binding by BAD was decreased when cells were treated with E2, indicating that activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by estrogens coincided with displacement of BAD from the TRE and CRE (Fig. 4C). Additionally, AP1-dependent luciferase activity (measured by a luciferase construct containing the minimal consensus AP1 element) was abolished by the overexpression of BAD in MCF7 cells (Fig. 4D) and T47D cells (data not shown). Together with the ChIP assays, this suggests that in resting cells, BAD may localize to TRE/CRE-AP1 complexes and regulate transcription through these interactions. The inability of the BH3 deletion mutant of BAD to inhibit AP1-dependent luciferase activity suggests that binding to other BCL2 family members is not required for transcriptional effects of this molecule. Similarly, Ser91, a residue phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (26Donovan N. Becker E.B. Konishi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40944-40949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), is not required for repression of AP1-dependent transcriptional activation, whereas Ser75 and Ser99 are absolutely required. These results suggest that BAD is able to inhibit the interaction of AP1 transcription factors with both CRE and TRE motifs. Collectively, the data suggest that BAD action on cyclin D1 expression is at least partly exerted at the transcriptional level and that BAD may repress the function of AP1 transcription factors at their target site, such as TRE and CRE. BAD Modifies AP1 Protein Interaction with Their Targets—Since BAD is devoid of known transcriptional motifs, we posited that the transcriptional effects on cyclin D1 expression are exerted indirectly via interactions with AP1 proteins. To further evaluate the inhibitory effects of BAD on AP1 transcription factors and DNA interaction, we used a minimal consensus AP1 protein binding DNA sequence (TGAGTCA) in EMSAs. We observed decreased DNA binding upon antibody depletion of BAD from the nuclear extract but not after depletion of BCL2 (Fig. 5A, lane 3 versus lane 4). Similarly, decreased AP1 binding was observed after BAD overexpressi"

Re-epithelialization is an essential step of wound healing involving the migration of epidermal keratinocytes over the wound site. Here, we examine genetic variants in the keratin-1 (KRT1) locus for association with migration rates of human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) isolated from different individuals. Although the role of intermediate filament genes, including KRT1, in wound activated keratinocytes is well established, this is the first study to examine if genetic variants in humans contribute to differences in the migration rates of these cells. Using an in vitro scratch wound assay we observe quantifiable variation in HEK migration rates in two independent sets of samples; 24 samples in the first set and 17 samples in the second set. We analyze genetic variants in the KRT1 interval and identify SNPs significantly associated with HEK migration rates in both samples sets. Additionally, we show in the first set of samples that the average migration rate of HEK cells homozygous for one common haplotype pattern in the KRT1 interval is significantly faster than that of HEK cells homozygous for a second common haplotype pattern. Our study demonstrates that genetic variants in the KRT1 interval contribute to quantifiable differences in the migration rates of keratinocytes isolated from different individuals. Furthermore we show that in vitro cell assays can successfully be used to deconstruct complex traits into simple biological model systems for genetic association studies."

Mutations in members of the β-catenin complex can compromise its integrity and ability to destabilize β-catenin. For example, impaired function of APC, which is observed in ∼85% of colorectal cancers, is accompanied by the stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin and the uncontrolled activation of cell proliferation programs. Interestingly, mutations in APC also result in decreased retinoic acid biosynthesis (26Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) product, was recently shown to promote the stabilization of β-catenin in colon cancer cell lines by displacing GKS-3β from the β-catenin complex, thus preventing its phosphorylation and degradation (29Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 30Shao J. Jung C. Liu C. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We previously showed that retinoic acid suppresses COX-2 expression in human cancer cell lines and in zebrafish embryos (31Eisinger A.L. Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Peterson P.W. Phelps R.A.

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that retinoic acid antagonizes β-catenin signaling by regulating the levels of PGE2 generated by COX-2. In this study, we demonstrated that β-catenin is stabilized in three retinoic acid-deficient mutant zebrafish. In addition, supplementation of apc mutant zebrafish embryos with retinoic acid decreased β-catenin protein expression by a mechanism that required attenuation of Cox-2 expression and decreased accumulation of PGE2. Treatment of wild-type embryos with PGE2 led to stabilization of β-catenin, whereas reducing PGE2 levels in apc mutant zebrafish results in the degradation of β-catenin. These combined results establish a role for PGE2 as a key determinant of β-catenin signaling in vivo. Embryo Culture and Zebrafish Stocks—Wild-type, apc mutant, and nls mutant Danio rerio (zebrafish) were maintained on a 14:10-h light:dark cycle. Fertilized embryos were collected following natural spawnings and allowed to develop at 28.5 °C. Control and experimental embryos were raised in 0.003% phenylthiourea to inhibit pigment formation. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Zebrafish embryos were fixed in sucrose-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in methanol, and stored at -20 °C. The riboprobe for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated by linearization of pCRII (Invitrogen) containing GFP cDNA followed by in vitro transcription with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). The embryos were cleared in 70% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline and photographed using an Olympus DP12 digital camera. Quantitative RT-PCR—We isolated RNA from embryos and cell lines using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and then synthesized single-stranded cDNA from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using a Light Cycler instrument and software (version 3.5, Roche Diagnostics). The sequences of PCR primers used were as follows: GFP forward, 5′-CCAGATCCGCCACAACATCG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTCCATGCCGAGAGTGATCC-3′. We performed duplicate PCRs using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green 1 kit (Roche Diagnostics). The amplification conditions for GFP included 10 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 5 s of annealing at 57 °C, and 10 s of extension at 72 °C, for a total of 35 cycles. A template-free negative control was included in each experiment. Quantitative RT-PCR primers and conditions for amplification of 28 S rRNA, cox-2, and mmp9 were described previously (31Eisinger A.L. Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Peterson P.W. Phelps R.A. Chidester S. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol.

Sequences for the apc and cox-2 morpholinos were described previously (27Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol.

The raldh2 morpholino (5′-GTTCAACTTCACTGGAGGTCATC-3′) and the control morpholino (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) were dissolved in 1× Danieau buffer and adjusted to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. For microinjections, 1.0 nl of 1.0 mm morpholino was injected into wild-type embryos at the one- to four-cell stage. Messenger RNA for Cox-2 and Apc-(1–1318) were synthesized using mMessage mMachine (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cox-2 mRNA and Apc-(1–1318) mRNA were injected into embryos at the one-cell stage. Drug Treatments—To investigate the role of retinoic acid in β-catenin expression, we incubated embryos with 900 nm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) in Me2SO at 50% epiboly for 1 h. After washing with embryo water, we treated the embryos with 20 nm all-trans-retinoic acid at 30 and 54 hpf for 1 h and then repeated the washing step. Inhibition of Cox-2 was accomplished by treating embryos at 50% epiboly, 30 and 54 hpf with the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (Cayman Chemical). Embryos were incubated with 5 μm PGE2 (Cayman Chemical) in Me2SO for the time periods described in the figure legends. To antagonize the EP2 receptor, embryos were treated with 3 μm AH-6809 (Cayman Chemical) in Me2SO at 50% epiboly, 30 and 54 hpf. Inhibition of the proteasome was accomplished by incubating 54-hpf embryos with 20 μm MG-132 for 18 h before harvesting. Antibodies and Western Blotting—We obtained extracts from zebrafish embryos in 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) with the aid of a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were frozen at -80 °C and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min to remove the insoluble components. We assessed protein concentration in the supernatants (using the BCA protein assay; Pierce) and then subjected 20–60 μg of protein to electrophoresis on 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PolyScreen), we stained the proteins using Ponceau S solution for 2 min and then blocked the remaining protein-binding sites with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST. The primary antibodies used throughout this study were obtained from Cayman Chemical (anti-COX-2), Cell Signaling (anti-β-catenin), and ICN Biomedicals (anti-actin). We then probed the membranes using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (BIOSOURCE) and a chemiluminescence detection system (Western Lightning) to reveal the presence of immunoreactive proteins. PGE2 Enzyme Immunoassay—Prostaglandin E2 levels were measured in wild-type and apc mutant zebrafish embryos using a PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical). Retinoic Acid Negatively Regulates Expression of β-Catenin— We reported previously that APC is also an essential regulator of retinoic acid biosynthesis (26Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T.

Peterson P.W. Phelps R.A. Chidester S. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20474-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, parallel work has shown that PGE2, a COX-2 product, promotes the stabilization of β-catenin in colon cancer cell lines by displacing GKS-3β from the β-catenin destruction complex (29Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 30Shao J. Jung C. Liu C. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that APC control of retinoic acid and COX-2 may function to regulate the stability of β-catenin and consequent downstream signaling. To examine this possibility, we supplemented developing apc mutant zebrafish embryos with retinoic acid and found that this reduced levels of β-catenin protein (Fig. 1A). The functional consequences of reduced β-catenin were reflected by remarkably reduced transcript levels of two β-catenin target genes, mmp9 (Fig. 1B) and mmp13 (not shown) (34Blavier L. Lazaryev A. Dorey F. Shackleford G.M. DeClerck Y.A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2691-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Tamamura Y. Otani T. Kanatani N. Koyama E. Kitagaki J. Komori T. Yamada Y.

To test the hypothesis that the higher levels of β-catenin seen in apc mutant embryos resulted from a lack of retinoic acid production, we next examined the converse situation. We measured the levels of β-catenin in zebrafish neckless (nls) mutants in which disruption of the retinal dehydrogenase2(raldh2) gene results in profound retinoic acid deficiency (36Begemann G. Schilling T.F. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Ingham P.W. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3081-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that nls embryos expressed higher levels of β-catenin compared with wild-type embryos, a result that is consistent with our observations in apc mutants. These findings indicated that retinoic acid deficiency alone increased β-catenin levels (Fig. 1C). This conclusion was further substantiated when we utilized Top-dGFP zebrafish, a genetically engineered reporter line used as a measure of the state of activation of β-catenin (37Dorsky R.I. Sheldahl L.C. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We found that antisense morpholino knockdown of Raldh2 in TOPdGFP embryos robustly increased dGFP expression, indicating β-catenin activation (Fig. 1D). Taken together, our data suggested that Apc controls β-catenin levels by a mechanism that involves retinoic acid. Down-regulation of Cox-2 Is Required for Apc-mediated Inhibition of β-Catenin Expression—Because retinoic acid suppressed Cox-2 expression in apc mutant zebrafish and given that two groups recently demonstrated that PGE2 stabilized β-catenin in human colon cancer cell lines (29Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 30Shao J. Jung C. Liu C. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we next tested whether Cox-2 and PGE2 served as intermediates between retinoic acid and β-catenin. Consistent with this idea, we first found that antisense morpholino-mediated knockdown of Cox-2 in apc mutant embryos significantly reduced β-catenin protein levels (Fig. 2A) (33Grosser T. Yusuff S. Cheskis E. Pack M.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8418-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of Cox-2 activity with the selective antagonist NS-398 (33Grosser T. Yusuff S. Cheskis E. Pack M.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8418-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) strongly suppressed β-catenin expression compared with Me2SO-treated embryos (Fig. 2C). Decreased activation of the β-catenin target genes mmp9 (Fig. 2, B and D) and mmp13 (not shown) paralleled the reduced levels of β-catenin. These results demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Cox-2 was necessary for up-regulation and activation of β-catenin when the function of Apc was impaired. Overexpression of Cox-2 Increases Expression of β-Catenin in Wild-type Zebrafish—To investigate if Cox-2 regulated the expression of β-catenin when the function of Apc was intact, we overexpressed Cox-2 in wild-type zebrafish embryos by injection of cRNA and then assessed the expression of β-catenin using immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A). This treatment resulted in the up-regulation of β-catenin compared with vehicle-injected embryos (Fig. 3A). Moreover, overexpression of Cox-2 increased activation of β-catenin target genes, as demonstrated by elevated expression of mmp9 (Fig. 3B). Finally, overexpression of Cox-2 also increased expression of dGFP in reporter TOPdGFP zebrafish (Fig. 3C). These studies indicated that signaling through Cox-2 results in the functional up-regulation of β-catenin and activation of target genes in wild-type zebrafish embryos. PGE2 Increases β-Catenin Levels in Wild-type Zebrafish Embryos—Castellone et al. (29Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that PGE2 alters the stability of the β-catenin degradation complex by promoting the dissociation of GSK-3β from axin in human cell lines. To determine whether PGE2 played a similar role in vivo and following apc mutation, we investigated the role for PGE2 on the stabilization and activation of β-catenin in apc mutant zebrafish embryos. We first determined the levels of PGE2 in apc mutant zebrafish embryos and found that the levels of PGE2 were severalfold higher than those present in wild-type controls (Fig. 4A). In addition, a specific EP2 receptor antagonist (AH-6809) blocked accumulation of β-catenin in apc mutant zebrafish (Fig. 4B), thereby indicating that the high endogenous levels of PGE2 mediated the up-regulation of β-catenin in vivo. To determine whether up-regulation of PGE2 was sufficient to increase β-catenin levels, we treated wild-type zebrafish embryos with 5 μm PGE2 and saw increased β-catenin protein levels in comparison to vehicle (Me2SO)-treated wild-type embryos (Fig. 4C). The PGE2-mediated stabilization of β-catenin was accompanied by activation of mmp9 (Fig. 4D) and mmp13 (not shown). Additionally, treatment of TOPdGFP embryos with PGE2 increased expression of dGFP compared with Me2SO-treated controls reflecting functional activation of β-catenin (Fig. 4E). To confirm that the observed increase in PGE2 and subsequent increase in β-catenin depended on Apc loss, we injected apc mutant embryos with a region of Apc (Apc-(955–2075)), previously shown to down-regulate β-catenin (38Shih I.M. Yu J. He T.C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1671-1676PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, expression of Apc-(955–2075) robustly reduced β-catenin levels (Fig. 2F), an effect that was overcome by treatment with PGE2 (Fig. 4F). These results indicated that the effect of PGE2 on β-catenin expression occurred downstream of Apc and supported a model wherein PGE2 mediates stabilization and activation of β-catenin following Apc loss. Truncated Apc Is Required for β-Catenin Degradation Following Inhibition of COX-2—Mutations in APC are thought to impair formation of a functional β-catenin degradation complex. Surprisingly, we found that retinoic acid treatment, or inhibition of Cox-2 activity, each caused loss of β-catenin protein expression in apc mutant zebrafish despite the presence of a typical, truncated form of Apc. This suggested that truncated Apc may retain some ability to form a functional β-catenin degradation complex. To address this issue we first asked whether β-catenin degradation following Cox-2 inhibition required the action of the proteasome. To do so, we decreased PGE2 accumulation in apc mutants using NS-398 but also tested the effects of MG-132, an inhibitor of the proteasome. We found that MG-132 treatment attenuated the ability of NS-398 to decrease β-catenin levels, indicating that apc mutant embryos degraded β-catenin through a proteasome-dependent process (Fig. 5A). To investigate whether some form of Apc was essential for degradation of β-catenin following Cox-2 inhibition, we suppressed the expression of full-length Apc in wild-type embryos using an Apc-specific splice-blocking antisense morpholino. As expected, Apc morphants expressed higher total levels of β-catenin, reflecting functional down-regulation of Apc (Fig. 5B) and higher levels of Cox-2 (data not shown and see Ref. 31Eisinger A.L. Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Peterson P.W. Phelps R.A. Chidester S. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20474-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to our observations in apc mutant embryos, blockade of PGE2 synthesis in Apc morphants failed to reduce levels of β-catenin (Fig. 5B). We could rescue this defect by co-injection of a cRNA encoding amino acids 1–1318 of Apc, the region precisely representing the truncated form expressed in apc mutant zebrafish. Injection of Apc morphants with Apc-(1–1318) cRNA alone had no effect on β-catenin protein levels. In contrast, injection of Apc morphants with Apc-(1–1318) cRNA along with treatment by NS-398 robustly decreased β-catenin protein levels (Fig. 5B) and expression of mmp9 (Fig. 5C). These observations indicated that Apc-(1–1318) is required for the degradation of β-catenin seen in the presence of Cox-2 inhibition. This conclusion is consistent with results shown in Fig. 2, C and D, demonstrating that inhibition of PGE2 synthesis with a Cox-2 inhibitor restored β-catenin to nearly basal levels in the presence of truncated Apc. We previously reported that the tumor suppressor APC is an essential regulator of retinoic acid biosynthesis (27Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additional studies indicated that APC control of retinoic acid biosynthesis occurs through the transcriptional regulator CtBP-1 and that this control is independent of β-catenin (39Nadauld L.D. Chidester S. Shelton D.N. Rai K. Broadbent T. Sandoval I.T. Peterson P.W. Manos E.J. Ireland C.M. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37828-37835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the regulation of retinoic acid biosynthesis appears independent of the actions of β-catenin, the converse may not hold true. Indeed, a number of studies suggest that retinoic acid may antagonize the actions of β-catenin. First, studies in SW480 cells indicated that activated RARs sequestered β-catenin from the TCF transcription factor, thus preventing transcription of β-catenin/TCF target genes (11Easwaran V. Pishvaian M. Salimuddin Byers S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, RXR agonists appear to accelerate the destruction of β-catenin through a proteasome-dependent process (12Xiao J.H. Ghosn C. Hinchman C. Forbes C. Wang J. Snider N. Cordrey A. Zhao Y. Chandraratna R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29954-29962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mechanism leading to the destruction of β-catenin following RXR activation is currently unclear. Recent evidence implicates retinoic acid in suppressing the expression of Cox-2 downstream of Apc, a process that presumably leads to decreased PGE2 accumulation (31Eisinger A.L. Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Peterson P.W. Phelps R.A. Chidester S. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20474-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given the recent demonstrations that the COX-2 product, PGE2, stabilized β-catenin (29Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 30Shao J. Jung C. Liu C. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we reasoned that retinoic acid may antagonize β-catenin by a mechanism that required attenuation of Cox-2 expression and decreased accumulation of PGE2. We tested this possibility using three independent approaches as follows: down-regulation of Cox-2 expression, inhibition of Cox-2 enzymatic activity, and Cox-2 overexpression. The results of our studies consistently supported a role for Cox-2 as a positive regulator of β-catenin signaling. These findings extend previous studies and support a model wherein retinoic acid suppresses β-catenin signaling by inhibiting the expression of Cox-2. Castellone et al. (29Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) recently elucidated the mechanism by which PGE2 stabilizes β-catenin in colorectal carcinoma cells. They showed that PGE2 promoted the dissociation of GSK-3β from axin within the β-catenin destruction complex. This dissociation prevented GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin. Details concerning the interplay between other complex members were not addressed. Our findings showed that the enzymatic activity of Cox-2 was necessary for stabilization of β-catenin in vivo. We found that treatment of wild-type zebrafish embryos with PGE2 increased β-catenin protein levels and activated β-catenin target genes in vivo. Conversely, reducing PGE2 levels in apc mutant zebrafish by inhibiting Cox-2 resulted in degradation of β-catenin. These findings provide solid evidence demonstrating that PGE2 plays a critical role in the stabilization of β-catenin in vivo and places Cox-2 activity upstream of β-catenin stabilization following apc mutation. Our studies also revealed an interesting feature about APC and the nature of the β-catenin destruction complex. Previous studies have demonstrated that most APC mutations, including the one in apc mutant zebrafish, result in a truncated protein that no longer binds axin and that binding of APC and axin is necessary for degradation of β-catenin (16Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). However, a number of studies have suggested that truncated forms of APC retain β-catenin binding activity (19Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 41Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar). apc mutant zebrafish recapitulate a typical apc mutation that is seen in human polyposis and colorectal cancers (42Hurlstone A.F. Haramis A.P. Wienholds E. Begthel H. Korving J. Van Eeden F. Cuppen E. Zivkovic D. Plasterk R.H. Clevers H. Nature. 2003; 425: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Therefore, they provide a unique in vivo experimental system for examining the downstream responses to wild-type or truncated Apc (42Hurlstone A.F. Haramis A.P. Wienholds E. Begthel H. Korving J. Van Eeden F. Cuppen E. Zivkovic D. Plasterk R.H. Clevers H. Nature. 2003; 425: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In this case, inhibition of PGE2 accumulation in embryos expressing this truncated form of Apc resulted in the degradation of β-catenin. In contrast, elimination of the entire Apc molecule using an antisense morpholino approach prevented the destruction of β-catenin following inhibition of Cox-2. Our observations are consistent with a model in which mutant Apc retains the ability to form a complex with β-catenin, but the nature of this complex is such that degradation is severely impaired by high levels of PGE2. It is possible that this truncated form of Apc retains enough β-catenin binding to aid in its degradation. Indeed, while this manuscript was under review, Schneikert et al. (43Schneikert J. Grohmann A. Behrens J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) reported that truncated APC regulates β-catenin transcriptional activity in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This regulation, however, did not appear to result from changes in β-catenin stability. In summary, we have shown that retinoic acid antagonizes β-catenin by regulating levels of Cox-2 and PGE2. These in vivo data concur with previous findings in colorectal carcinoma cells and provide further evidence to support a role for PGE2 in the dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex, accumulation of β-catenin, migration to the nucleus, and activation of target genes. Moreover, our studies show that a typical truncated form of Apc retains the ability to target β-catenin for destruction by the proteasome, but only in the absence of Cox-2 activity. These findings place retinoic acid and Cox-2 as intermediates in the Apc/Wnt signaling pathway and have important implications regarding the consequences of APC mutation in colorectal cancer. Apc-mediated destruction of β-catenin following inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis may explain, in part, the molecular basis for the efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of colon cancer.

Recent advances have provided a flexible, rather than static, view of chromatin regulation to reveal how both positive and negative forces work concomitantly to establish specific chromatin structures and regulate gene expression. The challenge will now be to explore new epigenetic models and validate them during lymphocyte development, with the ultimate goal of unraveling the long-sought mechanisms that support the emerging complexity of the adaptive immune response."

Originally, the different members of this family were named according to the tissue from which they were first isolated. More recently, an alternative nomenclature has been proposed, since it is well known that different FABP types can be present in the same tissue (7Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In particular, in the liver of several vertebrates, two paralogous groups of FABPs have been described: the liver FABPs and another group that was initially called the liver “basic” FABPs and is currently referred to as the liver bile acid-binding proteins (L-BABPs) (8Ceciliani F. Monaco H.L. Ronchi S. Faotto L. Spadon P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part B. 1994; 109: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Santomé J.A. Di Pietro S.M. Cavagnari B.M. Córdoba O.L. Dell'Angelica E.C. Trends Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 4: 23-38Google Scholar). The reason for this unusual nomenclature was that the isoelectric point of the first protein of this group that was described, chicken liver BABP, is 9.0, and although it was evident that this protein was different from the canonical liver FABP, its specific ligand was unknown (10Scapin G. Spadon P. Pengo L. Mammi M. Zanotti G. Monaco H.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When it was shown that this protein could specifically bind cholic acid, a change in its designation was suggested to avoid confusion (11Nichesola D. Perduca M. Capaldi S. Carrizo M.E. Righetti P.G. Monaco H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14072-14079Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cytosolic bile acid-binding proteins mediate the intracellular movement of bile acids to the membranes across which they exit or enter the cells via membrane-bound transporters (12Alrefai, W. A., and Gill, R. K. (2007) Pharm. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). The L-BABPs have been shown to be present in birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish but not in mammals that express the very similar ileal BABPs, formerly called gastrotropins. It is suspected, although not proved, that the function that they perform in the liver of the species in which they have been found may be carried out in mammals by the other paralogous protein in the liver, L-FABP. X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have been used to experimentally determine the three-dimensional structure of many members of the FABP family both in their apo form and complexed with lipophilic ligands. All of the members of the family share the same fold, a 10-stranded β barrel in which two short helices are inserted between the first and the second strand of antiparallel β sheet. The first L-BABP three-dimensional structure determined by x-ray diffraction was that of chicken liver BABP (13Scapin G. Spadon P. Mammi M. Zanotti G. Monaco H.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 98: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), followed by toad (14Di Pietro S.M. Corsico B. Perduca M. Monaco H.L. Santomé J.A.

Proteins. 2006; 64: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NMR and other biophysical techniques have also been used to study chicken L-BABP, which remains the best characterized member of the L-BABP family (16Schievano E. Quarzago D. Spadon P. Monaco H.L. Zanotti G. Peggion E. Biopolymers. 1994; 34: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Beringhelli T. Goldoni L. Capaldi S. Bossi A. Perduca M. Monaco H.L.

The most important result of these structural studies is that the stoichiometry of binding for cholate is of two ligands per protein molecule (11Nichesola D. Perduca M. Capaldi S. Carrizo M.E.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12604-12611Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is an unusual characteristic of the paralogous L-FABPs that they bind two molecules of oleate in their binding sites (19Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol.

Another important aspect described is the conformational changes that take place upon ligand binding that have been studied in chicken L-BABP by both x-ray diffraction (11Nichesola D. Perduca M.

Acta. 2000; 1492: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there is currently no three-dimensional structure available of an L-BABP belonging to this vertebrate group. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful animal model that is widely used to study vertebrate development. The presence in this species of the gene coding for liver BABP has been reported, and the cDNA clone coding for the protein has been isolated (27Denovan-Wright E.M. Pierce M. Sharma M.K. Wright J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the expression, purification, crystallization, and three-dimensional structure determination of zebrafish liver BABP. We have prepared and examined co-crystals with cholate of the wild type protein and two mutants. The wild type protein and one of the mutants bind one cholate molecule per binding site, whereas the other mutant has the stoichiometry found in chicken and axolotl L-BABP of two ligands per binding site. Isothermal titration calorimetry has yielded results that are consistent with the x-ray data. Protein Expression, Purification, Complex Formation, and Crystallization—The cDNA coding for zebrafish liver BABP (IMAGE ID 5410136), obtained from RZPD (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fuer Genomforschung GmbH), was amplified by PCR using primers designed to introduce restriction sites for BamHI and HindIII endonucleases and a sequence coding for a digestion site for thrombin in the C-terminal end in the amplified fragment. After purification, the fragment and the expression vector pQE50 (Qiagen) were digested with the restriction enzymes mentioned above and incubated with ligase to insert the cDNA in the vector respecting the reading frame. SG13009 E. coli cells were transformed with the resulting vector and grown at 37 °C, and protein synthesis was induced overnight at 20 °C with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Under these conditions of subcloning in pQE50, the expressed intracellular domain is fused to a histidine tag through its C terminus. The presence of the tag allowed the affinity purification of the fused protein by passing the bacterial extracts through a nickel-Sepharose column. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.02% NaN3, and the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 10 to 500 mm. After the affinity column, the tag was removed by thrombin digestion, and the protein was further purified by gel filtration in a Super-dex G-75 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3. Complete removal of the tag was assessed by Western blot analysis using an anti-His-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma). The purified protein showed one band in SDS-PAGE. Five times the molar protein concentration of sodium cholate was added to the apoprotein at a concentration of about 30 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in order to prepare the complex with the ligand. The solution was stirred overnight at 20 °C and used at this concentration for the initial screen of crystallization conditions. Hampton Research Screens were used at 20 °C with the hanging drop method, mixing 1 μl of the protein solution with the same volume of the precipitating solution and equilibrating versus a volume of 0.3 ml of the latter in the reservoir. The conditions yielding very small crystals were later refined, and the sitting drop method with larger volumes was also tested until crystals that were large enough for data collection were obtained. The best crystals of the wild type z-L-BABP cholate complex grow by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 20% isopropyl alcohol. They are thin rods of about 2.5 mm × 30 μm × 30 μm and grow to their full size in very few days at 20 °C. The mutants were generated using the commercial QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and primers designed to introduce the proper mutations. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by plasmid sequencing. Protein expression and purification followed the protocol used for the wild type protein. The co-crystals of both mutants were grown using a protocol identical to that of the wild type protein. In the case of the C91T mutant, the precipitant was a solution of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 30% polyethylene glycol 4000. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—The co-crystals of wild type z-L-BABP and cholate are trigonal, space group P32, with a = b = 43.4 Å and c = 67.5 Å and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit (see Table 1). The co-crystals of the G55R mutant with cholate are isomorphous with this form, whereas those of the C91T mutant are monoclinic, space group P21, with a = 28.0 Å, b = 63.3 Å, c = 35.7 Å, and β = 105.5° (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData setL-BABP wild type + cholateL-BABP G55R + cholateL-BABP C91T + cholateSpace groupP32P32P21a (Å)43.3643.4828.01b (Å)43.3643.4863.28c (Å)67.5367.3435.67α90.090.090.0β90.090.0105.51γ120.0120.090.0Resolution range (Å)33.8-1.5050.0-1.8721.1-1.50Observed reflections59,90639,46569,200Independent reflections21,47111,01619,136MultiplicityaThe values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shells.

Open table in a new tab The data for the co-crystals with cholate of the wild type and C91T mutant of the protein were collected at the ID29 beam line of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble (λ = 0.98 Å) at 100 K after a brief soaking in a mixture of 80% mother liquor and 20% glycerol. The data were indexed, integrated, and reduced using the programs MOSFLM and Scala (28Leslie A.G.W. Jnt. CCP4/ESF-EACMB Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26: 27-33Google Scholar, 29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The data for the co-crystals of the G55R mutant were collected on the home source at 100 K after a brief soaking in a mixture of 80% mother liquor and 20% glycerol. The detector was a MarResearch imaging plate mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode x-ray generator. The source was operated at 50 kV and 100 mA, and monochromatic copper Kα radiation was obtained using Xenocs mirrors. The data were indexed, integrated, and reduced using the program AUTOMAR. The diffraction data statistics are summarized in Table 1. The structure of the complex wild type zebrafish L-BABP-cholate was solved using the CCP4 suite of programs for crystallographic computing. The initial phases were calculated by the molecular replacement method as implemented in the program AMoRe (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar), with the coordinates of chicken L-BABP (Protein data bank accession code 1TW4) as the search probe. When the rotation function was calculated with the data in the 8.0-3.0 Å resolution range, the two highest peaks had correlation coefficients of 20.2 and 11.5. The translation function, calculated for the first peak, gave an unambiguous and convincing answer with a correlation coefficient of 26.3 and an R factor of 54.0% and, after rigid body refinement, with a correlation coefficient of 46.2 and an R factor of 49.4%. Using data up to 2.0 Å resolution, the model was rigid body-refined moving initially the entire molecule and, in a second stage, the elements of secondary structure using the program REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). After the proper side chains had been introduced, the model was subjected to a series of rounds of positional refinement alternated with manual model revisions with the program XtalView (32McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) and the refinement program REFMAC. During the process of refinement and model building, the quality of the model was controlled with the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were added to the model in the final stages of refinement according to hydrogen bond criteria and only if their B factors refined to reasonable values and if they improved the R free. A similar procedure was followed to solve the structure of the C91T mutant. In this case, the two highest peaks of the rotation function had correlation coefficients of 26.6 and 17.5, whereas the translation function of the first peak had a correlation coefficient of 34.1 and an R factor of 50.0%, which, after rigid body refinement, became 48.0 and 46.6%. Refinement of this structure was also carried out with the program REFMAC following essentially the same procedure described above. The crystals of the G55R mutant are isomorphous to the wild type protein. The model was refined using the program REFMAC. The final refinement statistics for the models of the three crystal forms are summarized in Table 1. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—The proteins and sodium cholate were dissolved in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.02% sodium azide. The sodium cholate concentrations in the titrating solution and the initial protein concentration in the measurement cell were 0.62 and 0.026 mm, respectively, for the wild type protein, 0.90 and 0.028 mm, respectively, for the G55R mutant, and 1.0 and 0.0136 mm, respectively, for the C91T mutant. The titrations were performed at 25 °C using a CSC 4200 isothermal titration calorimeter. A total of 25 injections of 10-μl aliquots of titrating solution were added to the 1.3-ml protein solution cell. The heat of the injections was corrected for the heat of dilution of the ligand into the buffer. Several binding models were tested to interpret the calorimetric data, and the fitting functions are described in the literature (34Castronuovo G. Elia V. Fessas D. Velleca F. Viscardi G. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 287: 127-138Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Wyman, J., and Gill, S. J. (1990) Binding and Linkage, pp. 49-59, University Science Books, Mill Valley, CAGoogle Scholar, 36Gill, S. J., Robert, C. H., and Wyman, J. (1988) in Biochemical Thermodynamics (Jones, M. N., ed) Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., AmsterdamGoogle Scholar). Briefly, the observable enthalpy is given by Equation 1, ΔH(T,p,μL)=−R[δlnQδ(1/T)]p,μL(Eq. 1) and the degree of association (i.e. the concentration ratio x¯=[bound ligand]/[total protein] is given by Equation 2, x¯=RT[δlnQδμL]T,P=RT[δlnQδln[L]]T,P(Eq. 2) where R is the universal gas constant, μL is the chemical potential of the free ligand, [L] is the concentration of the free ligand, and Q is the partition function of the system referred to the free protein state (35Wyman, J., and Gill, S. J. (1990) Binding and Linkage, pp. 49-59, University Science Books, Mill Valley, CAGoogle Scholar). Since we can approximate these systems as diluted solutions, the thermodynamic activities of the solutes may be replaced with their molar concentrations. Under this assumption, the partition function (Equation 3), Q=∑j=0n[Pj]/[P0](Eq. 3) is the sum of the concentrations of all protein species, Pj, referred to the free protein, P0. Q depends on the assumptions made on the association (binding) mechanism and is the key function used to simulate the enthalpy so as to check the model with the experimental data and to obtain the association (or binding) constant, Kb, and the binding enthalpy ΔHb. The binding constant is a dimensionless quantity by definition. However, in order to stress the approximation of the thermodynamic activities with the molar concentrations, the use of m-1 units for this parameter is widely diffused and will be adopted in this paper. The fit based on the binding models was accomplished using the nonlinear Levendberg-Marquardt method (37Press, W. H., Flannery, B. P., Teukolsky, S. A., and Vetterling, W. T. (1989) Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing, pp. 521-538, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UKGoogle Scholar). The errors of each fitting parameter were calculated with a 95.4% confidence limit by the Monte Carlo simulation method. Structure and Ligand-binding Stoichiometry of the Wild Type Protein—The final model of the wild type co-crystals of z-L-BABP corresponds to the full-length 125-amino acid chain, 972 protein atoms, one cholate, 3 isopropyl alcohol, one glycerol, and 135 water molecules. The conventional R factor is 18.8%, and the free R factor is 20.9% (Table 1). The R factors and r.m.s. of Table 1 were calculated with the program REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). The stereochemical quality of the protein model was assessed with the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). 94.5% of the residues are in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot, and the remaining 5.5% are in the additionally allowed region. The overall fold consists of the canonical β barrel with 10 strands of anti-parallel β chain and the two α helices inserted between the first and the second strand. The final secondary structure assignments are, for the β strands, the following: strand A, residues 4-12; B, residues 37-43; C, residues 46-53; D, residues 56-63; E, residues 67-71; F, residues 77-85; G, residues 88-92; H, residues 97-103; I, residues 106-113; and J, residues 116-124. The two α helices span residues 14-20 and 25-30. Fig. 1a is a schematic diagram of the zebrafish L-BABP molecule with the experimental electron density for the single cholate ligand present in the binding site. Resolution and quality of the maps are such that this stoichiometry of binding is completely unambiguous. This result is totally unexpected, since in the other two L-BABP species of this family studied by x-ray diffraction of co-crystals, chicken (11Nichesola D. Perduca M. Capaldi S. Carrizo M.E. Righetti P.G. Monaco H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14072-14079Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and axolotl (15Capaldi S. Guariento M. Perduca M. Di Pietro S.M. Santomé J.A. Monaco H.L. Proteins. 2006; 64: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the stoichiometry found was unequivocally of two ligand molecules per binding site. Furthermore, although there is currently no x-ray structure available for the closely related mammalian ileal BABPs, the same stoichiometry of two ligands is supported by NMR experiments (38Tochtrop G.P.

Fig. 1b represents schematically hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the protein and the ligand. Using the program LSQKAB (40Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar), the model of zebrafish L-BABP was superimposed to that of chicken L-BABP (11Nichesola D. Perduca M. Capaldi S. Carrizo M.E. Righetti P.G. Monaco H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14072-14079Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1TW4). A stereo diagram of the two models with the ligands is represented in Fig. 1c. Interestingly, the single cholate molecule present in the zebrafish L-BABP binding site superimposes very well with one of the two molecules bound in the chicken liver protein, the one whose carboxylate is c"

Up to now, there have been no data concerning the amino acid sequences of the hydroxyproline-containing polypeptides of the insoluble wall fraction. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analyses of peptides released from the insoluble cell wall fraction by trypsin treatment revealed the presence of 14 peptide fragments that could be attributed to non-glycosylated domains of the chaotrope-soluble cell wall glycoprotein GP2.

Considerably more information concerning the presence of GP2 in the insoluble cell wall fraction was obtained by an immunochemical approach. For this purpose, 407 overlapping pentadecapeptides covering the whole known amino acid sequence of GP2 were chemically synthesized and probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against the deglycosylated, insoluble cell wall fraction.

They have been assigned to several subgroups such as extensins, repetitive proline-rich proteins, some nodulins, gum arabic glycoprotein, and arabinogalactan proteins (1Showalter A.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 2Sommer-Knudsen J. Bacic A. Clark A.E. Phytochemistry. 1997; 47: 483-497Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). As revealed by biochemical and molecular studies, all HRGPs are characterized by repeated motifs dominated by (hydroxy)proline and serine residues, arbinosyl/galactosyl side chains, and a polyproline II helical conformation (8Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). These commonalities have led Kieliszewski and Lamport (8Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) to propose that they derive from an ancient gene family. The extensin subgroup of the HRGP family includes proteins that are uniformly fibrous and devoted to meshwork formation, but several members of this particular subgroup, called chimeric extensins (8Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), contain both fibrous and globular domains, the globular portions presumably playing some additional role. These include some solanaceous lectins, in which the hydroxyproline-rich fibrous domains are assumed to anchor the protein to the wall and the globular domains are assumed to mediate sugar binding activity (1Showalter A.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 2Sommer-Knudsen J. Bacic A. Clark A.E. Phytochemistry. 1997; 47: 483-497Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Chimeric HRGPs are also expressed in reproductive tissues of higher plants (9Baldwin T.C. Coen E.S. Dickinson H.G. Plant J. 1992; 2: 733-739PubMed Google Scholar, 10Goldman M.H. Pezzotti M.

In the case of the volvocine green algae Chlamydomonas and Volvox, the vegetative and zygotic cell walls do not contain cellulose or other polysaccharides but consist exclusively of HRGPs (14Rubenstein A.L.

A multilayered architecture was observed for the walls of vegetative Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells as revealed by electron microscopic studies (16Roberts K. Gurney-Smith M. Hills G.J. J.

In addition to an “inner wall” of covalently cross-linked HRGPs reminiscent of the higher plant meshworks (19Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1550-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), they posses an “outer wall” of HRGPs that co-assemble into crystalline arrays. The arrays can be solubilized by treatment with aqueous solutions of chaotropic salts, and they reassemble when the chaotropic salts are removed by dialysis (19Goodenough U.W. Heuser J.E. J.

Overall, the cell wall of vegetative C. reinhardtii cells is a multilayered extracellular matrix consisting of an insoluble, hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein framework (17Roberts K. Philos. Trans. R.

Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Formation of gametes and zygotes results in the activation of genes encoding additional hydroxyproline-containing cell wall polypeptides (26Ferris P.J. Goodenough U.W. Mol. Cell.

Three major constituents of this chaotrope-soluble cell wall fraction (GP1, GP2, and GP3) have been proved to be chimeric HRGPs (21Goodenough U.W. Gebhart B. Mecham R.P. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 924-942Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). GP1 is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 272,359 Da and a carbohydrate content of 76% (31Ferris P.J. Woessner J.P. Waffenschmidt S. Kilz S. Drees J. Goodenough U.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Its polypeptide backbone (65,129 Da) (31Ferris P.J. Woessner J.P. Waffenschmidt S. Kilz S. Drees J. Goodenough U.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) contains 32.3 mol % hydroxyproline (21Goodenough U.W. Gebhart B. Mecham R.P. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 924-942Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which corresponds to the hydroxyproline content of the insoluble cell wall fraction (32Vogeler H.-P. Voigt J. König W.A. Plant Sci. 1990; 71: 119-128Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of GP1 derived from the nucleotide sequence of the gp1 gene (31Ferris P.J. Woessner J.P. Waffenschmidt S. Kilz S. Drees J. Goodenough U.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) consists of four domains. The (hydroxy)proline-rich sequences are located in domain 2, which contains 49 repeats of the PPSPX motif, and domain 3, which consists of PS repeats (31Ferris P.J. Woessner J.P. Waffenschmidt S. Kilz S. Drees J. Goodenough U.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both domains form the 100-nm long fibrous structure of this molecule (21Goodenough U.W.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas the globular head (21Goodenough U.W. Gebhart B. Mecham R.P. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 924-942Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) can be attributed to the C-terminal domain (domain 4). MALDI-TOF analyses of native GP2 and chemically deglycosylated GP2 revealed molecular masses of 281,250 and 142,600 Da, respectively, indicating a carbohydrate content of 49% (33Kilz S. Budzikiewicz H. Waffenschmidt S. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 37: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A putative partial amino acid sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence of a cloned gene fragment was published by Adair and Apt (34Adair W.S. Apt K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GP3 is a disulfide-linked heterodimer (21Goodenough U.W. Gebhart B. Mecham R.P. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 924-942Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Kilz S. Budzikiewicz H. Waffenschmidt S. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 37: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF analyses of GP3A and GP3B revealed molecular masses of 131,500 and 144,400 Da, respectively (33Kilz S. Budzikiewicz H. Waffenschmidt S. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 37: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After chemical deglycosylation, molecular masses of 70,550 and 102,290 Da were found for GP3A and GP3B (33Kilz S. Budzikiewicz H. Waffenschmidt S. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 37: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), respectively, indicating that the carbohydrate content of GP3A is considerably higher than that of GP3B. The insoluble wall fraction can be isolated from intact cells by successive extractions with different detergent-containing buffers (32Vogeler H.-P. Voigt J. König W.A. Plant Sci. 1990; 71: 119-128Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After chemical deglycosylation with hydrofluoride (HF)/pyridine, the “sac-like” morphology of the highly purified insoluble wall component is destroyed, and at least part of its polypeptide constituents become soluble in SDS-containing buffers (32Vogeler H.-P. Voigt J. König W.A. Plant Sci. 1990; 71: 119-128Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Isodityrosine has been detected in hydrolysates of Chlamydomonas cell walls (6Waffenschmidt S. Woessner J.P. Beer K. Goodenough U.W. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 809-820PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that peroxidase-catalyzed cross-linking of cell wall glycoproteins via tyrosine side chains, which has been observed for the extensins of higher plants (35Fry S.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 36Epstein L. Lamport D.T.A. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 1241-1246Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Biggs K.J. Fry S.C. Plant Physiol. 1990; 92: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), also occurs in Chlamydomonas. Furthermore, it has been reported that a transglutaminase also catalyzes cross-linking of cell wall proteins in C. reinhardtii (7Waffenschmidt S. Kusch T. Woessner J.P. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, both of these cross-links are not sensitive to HF treatment. Therefore, the observations that the sac-like morphology of the insoluble cell wall fraction is destroyed during chemical deglycosylation and that defined polypeptide constituents are released during this process indicate the existence of additional cross-links that are sensitive to HF treatment. It has been reported recently that a 14-3-3 protein is a minor constituent of the insoluble glycoprotein framework of the Chlamydomonas cell wall (38Voigt J. Frank R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1399-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This particular 14-3-3 isoform was also shown to preferentially interact with the endoplasmic reticulum membranes of C. reinhardtii (39Voigt J. Liebich I. Kiess M. Frank R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6449-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Voigt J. Stevanovic S. Schirle M. Fausel M. Maier J. Adam K.-H. Marquardt O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1679: 180-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Analyses of the amino acid composition of the insoluble fraction of the Chlamydomonas cell wall revealed a hydroxyproline content of >30% (32Vogeler H.-P. Voigt J. König W.A. Plant Sci. 1990; 71: 119-128Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Its HRGP constituents are, however, not yet characterized. Previous pulse-labeling and pulse-chase experiments and immunochemical studies indicated that the chaotrope-soluble cell wall fraction contains soluble precursors of the insoluble Chlamydomonas wall fraction (38Voigt J. Frank R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1399-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Voigt J. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41: 885-896Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Voigt J. Liebich I. Hinkelmann B. Kiess M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that the chaotrope-soluble HRGP GP2 is such a precursor of the insoluble glycoprotein framework of the Chlamydomonas cell wall. Strains and Growth Conditions—The C. reinhardtii Dangeard wild-type strain 137C (mating type +) was obtained from Dr. R. P. Levine (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). Cells were grown at 21 °C and 20,000 lux in high salt medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) sodium acetate as described previously (43Voigt J. Münzner P. Planta. 1987; 172: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cell densities were determined by duplicate hemocytometer counting. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with fresh culture medium. Extraction of Chaotrope-soluble Cell Wall Components—Salt-soluble cell wall components were extracted with aqueous LiCl (3 m) from intact cells as described previously (44Voigt J. Planta. 1985; 164: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in fresh culture medium to a final cell density of 2 × 108 cells/ml. After the addition of the same volume of aqueous LiCl (6 m), the suspensions were incubated at 0 °C for 3 h and subsequently centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were stored at –20 °C until used. Isolation of the Insoluble Cell Wall Component—The insoluble cell wall component of C. reinhardtii was isolated from the LiCl-extracted intact wild-type cells by treatment with different detergent-containing buffers. The LiCl-extracted wild-type cells (corresponding to 2 g, fresh weight) were twice washed with distilled water and resuspended in 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% (w/v) SDS and 200 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After 30 min at room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g. The insoluble wall fraction was isolated from the supernatant by filtration using Stericup-VP filter units (250 ml) with 0.1-μm Express (polyethersulfone) membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filters were washed twice with 50 ml of 1% SDS in PBS, twice with 50 ml of PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and finally with 50 ml of distilled water. The filters were than cut into small pieces, vortexed in 5 ml of PBS, and shaken overnight to resuspend the insoluble cell wall material. Purification of Chaotrope-soluble Cell Wall Polypeptides—The high molecular mass, chaotrope-soluble polypeptide fraction of the Chlamydomonas cell wall was isolated from the LiCl extracts of intact wild-type cells by hydrophobic chromatography using phenyl-Sepharose as a matrix and further purified by gel exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column. The fractions of the first peak of the Sephacryl S-300 column containing the high molecular mass cell wall glycoproteins were combined, desalted, and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried material was used as the starting material for chemical deglycosylation. The individual glycosylated or chemically deglycosylated cell wall polypeptides were isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) on gel slabs containing 7% (w/v) acrylamide. Chemical Deglycosylation—Deglycosylation of the cell wall glycoproteins was performed by treatment with trimethylsilyltrifluoromethane sulfonate in anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid containing thioanisole. The reagent was prepared by mixing 2 g of trimethylsilyltrifluoromethane sulfonate with 6.5 ml of anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.5 ml of thioanisole, cooled to 0 °C, and added to the freeze-dried cell wall glycoproteins (1 ml of reagent/10 mg of protein). After 5 h at 0 °C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of distilled water and 8 ml of ice-cold acetone (100%). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was washed twice with 80% (v/v) aqueous acetone and subsequently vacuum-evaporated until completely dry. Determination of Protein—Quantitations of proteins were performed by the method of Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Digestion with Glu-C Protease—The 200-kDa component isolated from the chemically deglycosylated, chaotrope-soluble cell wall fraction (10 mg) was suspended in 10 ml of distilled water, denatured by boiling at 100 °C for 30 min, and subsequently transferred to an ice bath. After the addition of 10 ml of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.5) and 100 μgof Glu-C protease, the reaction mixture was incubated in a water bath at 30 °C. Another 100 μg of Glu-C protease were added after 3 h. After 6 h, incubation was stopped by freezing. The reaction mixtures were freeze-dried and stored at –20 °C until used. SDS-PAGE and Protein Gel Blot Analyses—Macromolecules present in the LiCl extracts were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (10% (w/v) final concentration) in the cold, and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation. The pellets were washed twice with distilled water and redissolved in a small volume of urea/SDS buffer (44Voigt J. Planta. 1985; 164: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After the addition of sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) containing bromphenol blue as a tracking dye, the polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) on gel slabs (83 × 65 × 0.15 mm) containing 7.5 or 12.5% (w/v) acrylamide. After electrophoresis, the gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 or blotted electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Porablot, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) as described by Towbin et al. (47Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). After pretreatment of the blots with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 3 h at 37 °C or overnight at 7 °C, the protein gel blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against different cell wall polypeptides diluted 1:300 with PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After 1 h at 37 °C, the blots were washed four times with PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by treatment for 1 h at 37 °C with alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Braunschweig, Germany) diluted 1:800 with PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation, the blots were washed at least twice with PBS and subsequently twice with Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the indirectly bound alkaline phosphatase was detected by its enzyme activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as a substrate in the presence of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (48Hawkes R. Nidag E. Gordon J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). Epitope Analysis—A total of 407 overlapping pentadecapeptides representing the whole amino acid sequence of the Chlamydomonas GP2 protein derived from the open reading frame of the GP2 cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number BN001086) were generated by spot synthesis using a cellulose paper sheet as a solid support (49Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar). These overlapping pentadecapeptides were used to determine the epitope specificities of the different antibodies as described previously (38Voigt J. Frank R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1399-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar). After incubation with the antibody and extensive washing, bound rabbit IgG were measured by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and subsequent detection of the indirectly bound alkaline phosphatase via its enzyme activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as a substrate in the presence of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. After documentation of the results, the membrane was stripped as described previously (49Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Determination of N-terminal Amino Acid Sequences—The untreated and chemically deglycosylated cell wall polypeptides and their fragments obtained by cleavage with Glu-C protease were purified by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and blotted electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described by Towbin et al. (47Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, the protein bands were cut from the membrane and completely destained with methanol. N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation using a Model 470A gas-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mass Spectrometry—Proteolysis with trypsin of the purified insoluble cell wall fraction was performed essentially as described for in-gel digestion of protein bands cut from SDS-polyacrylamide gels (50Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). The cell wall material was digested for 3 h with porcine trypsin (sequencing grade, modified; Promega Corp., Madison, WI) at a concentration of 67 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.1) at 37 °C. Prior to peptide mass mapping and sequencing of tryptic fragments by tandem mass spectrometry, peptide mixtures were extracted from the insoluble cell wall material by 1% formic acid, followed by two changes of 50% acetonitrile. The combined extracts were vacuum-dried until only 1–2 μl were left and desalted using ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MALDI-reflector-TOF analysis of the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid-nitrocellulose prepared on the target using the fast evaporation method (51Arnott D. O'Connel K.L. King K.L. Stults J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258 (1): 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was performed on a Bruker Daltoniks REFLEX IV equipped with an N2 337-nm laser and gridless pulsed ion extraction. Sequence verifications of some fragments were performed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Q-Tof I mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a nanoflow electrospray ionization source. Gold-coated glass capillary nanoflow needles were obtained from Protana (medium NanoES spray capillaries). Data base searches (NCBInr non-redundant protein data base) were done using the MASCOT software from Matrix Science (52Perkins D.N. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). Isolation of DNA and RNA—RNA, high molecular mass Chlamydomonas DNA, and plasmid DNAs were isolated according to Maniatis et al. (53Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). cDNA Synthesis—cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of poly(A)-containing RNA (53Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) using SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). PCR—Primers for the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (54Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2076575061,"Expression of c-MET, the HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) tyrosine kinase receptor, was investigated in pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. c-MET was found to be expressed in normal B cells and in B-ALL patients with the t(12;21) TEL-AML1 translocation, but it is not expressed in the most part of B-ALL without the t(12;21). We also found that c-MET, related to proliferation and protection from apoptosis, is associated with the pro-apoptotic protein FAS in TEL-AML1 B-ALL cells and in normal B lymphocytes. The possible role of this protein complex in drug-induced apoptosis was thus investigated in REH TEL-AML1 B-ALL cell line. REH cells prestimulated with HGF and treated with doxorubicin had shown a higher apoptotic rate than non-HGF-prestimulated ones (p = 0.03). REH cells stimulated with IL-3 and treated with doxorubicin did not undergo apoptosis more than nonstimulated cells, demonstrating that increased proliferation in itself is not directly related to the higher apoptotic sensitivity observed with HGF stimulation. These results indicate that c-MET activation enhances specifically FAS-mediated apoptosis in TEL-AML1 ALL cells and, considering that the c-MET/FAS complex is present only in normal B lymphocytes and in TEL-AML1 leukemias, this implies that it may have an important contribution in cellular homeostasis and in high sensitivity of TEL-AML1 ALL to chemotherapeutic regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2014543689,"The protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms are maintained in an inactive and closed conformation by intramolecular interactions. Upon activation these are disrupted by activators, binding proteins and cellular membrane. We have seen that autophosphorylation of two sites in the C-terminal V5 domain is crucial to keep PKCα insensitive to the activator diacylglycerol, which presumably is caused by a masking of the diacylglycerol-binding C1a domain. Here we demonstrate that the diacylglycerol sensitivity of the PKCβ isoforms also is suppressed by autophosphorylation of the V5 sites. To analyze conformational differences, a fusion protein ECFP-PKCα-EYFP was expressed in cells and the FRET signal was analyzed. The analogous mutant with autophosphorylation sites exchanged for alanine gave rise to a substantially lower FRET signal than wild-type PKCα indicating a conformational difference elicited by the mutations. Expression of the isolated PKCα V5 domain led to increased diacylglycerol sensitivity of PKCα. We identified acidic residues in the V5 domain that, when mutated to alanines or lysines, rendered PKCα sensitive to diacylglycerol. Furthermore, mutation to glutamate of four lysines in a lysine-rich cluster in the C2 domain gave a similar effect. Simultaneous reversal of the charges of the acidic residues in the V5 and the lysines in the C2 domain gave rise to a PKCα that was insensitive to diacylglycerol. We propose that these structures participate in an intramolecular interaction that maintains PKCα in a closed conformation. The disruption of this interaction leads to an unmasking of the C1a domain and thereby increased diacylglycerol sensitivity of PKCα.

The family consists of ten isoforms with distinct regulatory properties and functions. They are traditionally subgrouped in classical (PKCα, βI, βII, and γ), novel (PKCδ, ϵ, η, and θ) and atypical (PKCζ and ι) PKC isoforms. The classification is based on the sensitivity of the isoforms to the PKC-activating second messengers Ca2+ and 1,2-diacylglycerol. The classical isoforms respond to both activators whereas novel PKCs are insensitive to Ca2+ but activated by diacylglycerol. The atypical isoforms are not regulated by any of the activators (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Curr. Opin.

In its inactive state, the PKC molecule is kept in a closed conformation by intramolecular interactions. This involves the binding of a pseudosubstrate motif (4House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), localized in the regulatory domain, to the substrate-binding site in the catalytic domain, thereby preventing the interaction of PKC with its substrates. To activate PKC second messengers interact with specific domains within the regulatory domain of the PKC molecule. Ca2+ binds the C2 domain and diacylglycerol interacts with one or both of the C1 domains. This generally leads to a translocation of the enzyme to cellular membranes and a concomitant conformational change resulting in the release of the pseudosubstrate from the catalytic domain and thereby an activation of the enzyme (5Colon-Gonzalez F. Kazanietz M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Corbalan-Garcia S. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is also clear that an isolated interaction of PKC with second messengers and membranes is not the sole pathway to activate PKC. There are numerous examples of interacting proteins that can either target the activated PKC to specific sites or can contribute to the direct activation of the enzyme (7Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 9Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The sensitivity to diacylglycerol varies considerably between the isoforms. Whereas PKCϵ rapidly translocates to the plasma membrane, particularly the classical isoforms are less responsive to an isolated increase in diacylglycerol (10Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M.

For classical isoforms many studies both with purified protein in vitro and using live cells demonstrate that the C1a domain is the diacylglycerol-sensitive C1 domain while the C1b domain is either insensitive or displays a weaker binding (11Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F.G. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 12Raghunath A. Ling M. Larsson C. Biochem.

However, the difference in sensitivity of the C1 domains cannot entirely explain why the holo-enzymes respond differentially to diacylglycerol. One model has been suggested for the activation of PKCγ, which proposes that the diacylglycerol-binding site in the C1 domains is structurally masked in PKCγ (13Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 30: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The site is putatively unmasked upon an interaction of the C2 domain with Ca2+ and cellular membranes. We have recently seen that either inhibition of the catalytic activity or mutation of the C-terminal autophosphorylation residues to alanine makes PKCα respond to DAG (19Stensman H. Raghunath A. Larsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40576-40583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This has led us to hypothesize that the C-terminal V5 domain takes part in intramolecular interactions that contribute to the masking of the C1a domain. This study was designed to investigate what specific residues of the V5 domain that may mediate such an interaction. Plasmids—Expression vectors encoding EGFP fusion proteins of full-length PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII, kinase-dead PKCα (PKCα K368R) and PKCαEDM (PKCα T638E/S657E) and PKCαADM (PKCα T638A/S657A) have been described previously (19Stensman H.

An expression vector encoding PKCα lacking the V5 domain (PKCαΔV5) fused to EGFP was generated by amplification of the desired DNA sequence with PCR using PKCαWT as a template. The PCR fragments were digested with BglII/SalI and ligated into these sites in the pEGFP-N1 vector. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce the K197E/K199E/K209E/K211E (PKCα(C2:4K/E)), D649A/D652A/E654A (PKCα(V5:3D/A)), and D649K/D652K/E654K (PKCα(V5:3D/K)) mutations in the PKCα-EGFP sequence using the expression vector encoding PKCαWT as a template. Using the same primers, (PKCα(C2: 4K/E,V5:3D/K))-EGFP was generated. To generate a fusion protein with PKCαWT fused to ECFP in the N-terminal and EYFP in the C-terminal a thymidine was introduced in the ECFP-C1 vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit to generate a suitable reading frame. The PKCα-EYFP cDNA was digested with BglII/XbaI, and the fragment was inserted in the modified pECFP-C1 vector. To generate fusions with ECFP in the N terminus and EYFP in the C terminus, PKC cDNAs were excised from the EGFP vector by using BglII/SalI and inserted into the ECFP-EYFP vector. Using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit expression vectors encoding PKCβI and PKCβII were mutated in the autophosphorylation sites to alter threonine in the turn motif (PKCβI Thr-661 and PKCβII Thr-660) and serine in the hydrophobic site (PKCβI Ser-642 and PKCβII Ser-641) to alanine (PKCβIADM and PKCβIIADM). Expression vectors encoding αV5EDM and αV5ADM fused to ECFP were generated by amplification of the desired DNA sequence with PCR using PKCαEDM and PKCαADM vectors as templates. The PCR fragments were digested with BglII/SalI and ligated into these sites in the pEGFP-C1 vector. The primers are listed in Table 1. All constructs were sequenced to confirm that they contained the right mutations.TABLE 1Primers used to generate PKC constructsPKCαV5EDM and PKCαV5ADM ForwardGCGAGATCTGTGTGTGGCAAAGGAGCAGAG ReverseCGCGTCGACTCATACTGCACTCTGTAAGATPKCαΔV5 ForwardGGAAGATCTGGACCATGGCTGACGTTTTC ReverseGCGGTCGACACTTTGGGCTTGAATGGTGGCPKCα(C2:4K/E) K209E/K211ECCCAAGAATGAAAGCGAGCAAGAAACCAAAACCATCCGC K197E/K199EGGCTTTCAGATCCTTATGTGGAGCTGGAACTTATTCCTGATCCCPKCα(V5:2D/A) D652A/E654ACATAGACCAGTCTGCTTTTGCAGGGTTCTCGTATGTCAACCCPKCα(V5:3D/A) D649AGGTTATTGCTAACATAGCCCAGTCTGCTTTTGCAGGGPKCα(V5:3D/K) D652K/E654KCATAGACCAGTCTAAGTTTAAAGGGTTCTCGTATGTCAACCCCC D649KGCTGGTTATTGCTAACATAAAGCAGTCTAAGTTTAAAGGGTTCTCGPKCβIADM T642AGCCTGTGGAACTGGCCCCCACTGATAAACTC S661AGAATTTGCTGGCTTCGCTTATACTAACCCAGAGTTTGTCPKCβIIADM T641AGCCATCCACCAGTCCTAGCACCTCCCG S660AGACCAATCAGAATTCGAAGGATTTGCCTTTGTTAACTCTG Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—Human SK-N-BE (2)C neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Minimal Essential Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For confocal imaging, cells were trypsinized and seeded with a density of 300,000 cells/35-mm cell culture dish on glass coverslips. For Western blot analysis 600,000 cells were seeded in 60-mm cell culture dishes and for FRET experiments 300,000 cells were seeded on 35-mm glass bottom culture plates (MatTek). For immunoprecipitation 2,000,000 cells were seeded in 100-mm cell culture dishes. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For immunofluorescence 300,000 cells/35-mm cell culture dish were seeded on glass cover slips. For the in vitro kinase assay 1,000,000 cells were seeded on 60-mm cell culture dishes.

Western Blot—Transfected SK-N-BE(2)C cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 160 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) containing 40 μl/ml protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Proteins were electrophoretically separated on a 10% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). For detection, membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-GFP (1:500) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), polyclonal anti-phospho-PKCα/βII (1:1000) or anti-phospho-PKC (1:1000) (both Cell Signaling) followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase was thereafter visualized using the SuperSignal system (Pierce) as substrate. The chemoluminescence was detected with a CCD camera (Fujifilm). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were treated according to the protocol supplied with μMACS Epitope-Tagged Protein Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Transfected SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer, supplied with the kit, containing 40 μl/ml protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C and incubated with anti-GFP-conjugated microbeads for 30 min. The immune complexes were recovered by applying the cell lysates on μColumns in the magnetic field of the μMACS Separator and then washed and eluted with buffers included in the kit. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 min followed by permeabilization with 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Thereafter cells were incubated with primary polyclonal anti-phospho-PKCα/βII (1:200) or anti-phospho-PKC (1:200) (both Cell Signaling) for 1 h followed by incubation with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular probes) diluted 1:800 in PBS for 1 h. Extensive washing was carried out between all steps and the cover slips were mounted on object slides. Confocal Microscopy—Live Cells were examined by confocal microscopy on the day after transfection. The glass coverslips were washed twice with buffer H (20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 3.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and mounted on a heated stage of a Nikon microscope. The cells were examined with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system using a 60× lens (numerical aperture 1.4) with excitation wavelengths of 457, 488, and 543 nm and the emission filters HQ485/30, 515HQ30, and HQ545/40 for ECFP, EGFP, and EYFP, respectively. Images were captured every 5 or 10 s, and five images were taken before the addition of 1 mm carbachol or 100 μm DOG. Fixed cells were examined using excitation wavelengths 488 nm for EGFP and 543 nm for Alexa 546. The emission filters were HQ485/30 for EGFP and HQ590/60 for Alexa 546. FRET Analysis—SK-N-BE(2)C cells were seeded on 35-mm glass bottom culture plates (MatTek). Cells were transfected with vectors encoding PKC fused N-terminally to ECFP and C-terminally to EYFP. On the day after transfection, cells were washed and incubated in buffer H. The dish was put on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus) in a 37 °C chamber. The fluorochromes were excited with a halogen lamp using the excitation filters (Chroma Technology) ET430/24x for ECFP and ET500/20x for EYFP. The fluorescence was captured with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu) using emission filters (Chroma Technology) ET470/24m for the ECFP signal and ET535/30m for EYFP. The FRET signal was detected using the ECFP excitation and EYFP emission settings. The bleed through of ECFP and EYFP into the FRET channel was calculated using cells expressing ECFP or EYFP alone and found to be 79% of the ECFP and 15% of the EYFP signal. After subtraction of background the FRET was calculated with the formula (FRETem-0.79xECFPem-0.15xEYFPem)/ECFPem using the Volocity image analysis software. The fluorescence signals were determined in an area encompassing ∼30% of the extranuclear area of a cell. Determination of PKC Activity—Transfected COS cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 40 μl/ml protease inhibitors), and lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. PKC activity was assayed in 100 μl containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 μm [32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm substrate (synthetic peptide derived from myelin basic protein, Genescript), and 25 μl of cell lysate. Phosphatidylserine (140 μm), diacylglycerol (3.8 μm), and CaCl2 (100 μm) were included as indicated. EGTA (500 μm) was used to assay the activity in the absence of calcium. Reactions were started by addition of substrate, [32P]ATP, and MgCl2, carried out at 20 °C and interrupted after 20 min by pipetting 80 μl of the mixture onto a Whatman P-81 ion-exchange paper (1.5 × 1.5 cm). Basal kinase activity was measured by excluding lipids and calcium and adding 500 μm EGTA to the reaction mixture. The filter papers were washed 3 × 5 min in 5 ml of 0.4% phosphoric acid and transferred into scintillation vials containing 10 ml of scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer) and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. To estimate the activity caused by the exogenous PKCα variants, the activity obtained with lysates from untransfected cells were deducted from the activity obtained with lysates from transfected cells, assayed under identical conditions. Removing the V5 Domain Makes PKCα Sensitive to Diacylglycerol—We have previously seen that stimulation of SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells with the diacylglycerol analogue DOG induces a sustained translocation of catalytically inactive PKCα and of a PKCα mutant with the autophosphorylation sites exchanged for alanine. This contrasts the wild-type and autophosphorylated PKCα which does not translocate upon application of DOG. These findings led us to hypothesize that the autophosphorylated V5 domain is involved in an intramolecular interaction hiding the diacylglycerol-binding C1a domain. To further establish the importance of the C-terminal V5 domain in maintaining PKCα insensitive to diacylglycerol the translocation of an EGFP fusion of PKCα with deleted V5 domain (PKCαΔV5) was investigated. Cells expressing PKCαΔV5-EGFP were stimulated with 100 μm DOG and the localization of the protein was examined by confocal microscopy. The PKCα mutant responded with a sustained translocation upon stimulation with DOG (Fig. 1, D-F) contrasting PKCαWT, which is insensitive to DOG (Fig. 1, A-C). Thus, the presence of the V5 domain is required to maintain PKCα in a diacylglycerol-insensitive state. PKCβI and PKCβII with Autophosphorylation Sites Mutated to Alanine Have an Increased Sensitivity to Diacylglycerol—The phosphorylation sites in the V5 domain are considered to be essentially constitutively autophosphorylated in classical PKC isoforms. Given the homology among these isoforms we aimed at investigating whether autophosphorylation influences the diacylglycerol sensitivity of PKCβI and PKCβII as well. Expression vectors encoding EGFP fusions of PKCβI and PKCβII with the threonine of the turn motif and the serine of the hydrophobic site mutated to alanine (PKCβIADM and PKCβIIADM) were therefore constructed (Fig. 2A). Cells expressing wild-type PKCβI or PKCβII or the non-phosphorylated mutants, all fused to EGFP were stimulated with DOG and the localization of the protein was examined by confocal microscopy. PKCβIADM and PKCβIIADM started to translocate within 1 min and remained by the membrane throughout the entire experiment (Fig. 2, E-G and K-M). While PKCαWT is almost completely insensitive to diacylglycerol PKCβIWT and PKCβIIWT in a few cells translocated to the plasma membrane upon stimulation with DOG (Fig. 2, B-D and H-J). However, the response is substantially weaker and more delayed than what was seen with the non-phosphorylated mutants. Taken together, the results demonstrate that autophosphorylation of the turn motif and the hydrophobic site function as a determinant for the diacylglycerol sensitivity for several classical PKC isoforms. FRET Analysis Indicates That Diacylglycerol Sensitivity Correlates to a Conformational Change of PKCα—Our previous data show that PKCα can be rendered diacylglycerol-sensitive by several alterations including deletion of the pseudosubstrate or the V5 domain, alanine mutations of the autophosphorylation sites or by inhibition of the kinase activity. The pseudosubstrate presumably binds the substrate binding site in the catalytic domain maintaining the inactive PKCα in a closed conformation. We have hypothesized that the diacylglycerol-binding site, the C1a domain, is masked in the inactive conformation. Modifications that more or less destabilize the closed conformation may consequently lead to an unmasking of the C1a domain and an increased sensitivity to diacylglycerol. To test this hypothesis we took an approach with the aim to estimate conformational changes in PKCα. This was done by constructing an expression vector encoding PKCα with a cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) fused to the N terminus and a yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) fused to the C terminus (Fig. 3A). If these fluorophores are in the absolute vicinity of each other a FRET signal is generated. The signal is dependent on the distance between the fluorophores and a different conformation of PKCα may lead to a changed distance between the N and C terminus of the enzyme and consequently a difference in the FRET signal. First we investigated if the different ECFP-PKCα-EYFP constructs behaved as expected when stimulated with carbachol and DOG. Carbachol stimulation leads to activation of phospholipase C resulting in a transient Ca2+ increase and a more sustained elevation of diacylglycerol levels. This results in a transient plasma membrane translocation of PKCαWT and PKCα with both autophosphorylation sites mutated to glutamate (PKCαEDM). On the other hand, kinase inactive PKCα (PKCαKD) and PKCα with the autophosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (PKCαADM) respond with a sustained translocation. Upon carbachol addition both ECFP-PKCαWT-EYFP and ECFP-PKCαEDM-EYFP rapidly but transiently translocated to the plasma membrane while ECFP-PKCαKD-EYFP and ECFP-PKCαADM-EYFP responded with a sustained translocation (Fig. 3B). Addition of DOG did not affect the localization of ECFP-PKCαWT-EYFP and ECFP-PKCαEDM-EYFP whereas ECFP-PKCαKD-EYFP and ECFP-PKCαADM-EYFP both responded with a translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). Thus, simultaneous fusion to variants of EGFP to both the N and C terminus of PKCα does not influence the translocation pattern of PKCα. Having confirmed that the ECFP-PKCα-EYFP fusion proteins respond as expected we set out to investigate whether the difference in sensitivity to diacylglycerol is reflected by an altered FRET signal. SK-N-BE(2)C cells expressing the ECFP/EYFP fusions of PKCαWT, PKCαKD, PKCαEDM, and PKCαADM were analyzed with fluorescent microscopy using a FRET filter setup. With this approach we were unfortunately not able to follow the signal during translocation. Epifluorescence did not allow for spatial discrimination between the plasma membrane and cytosol and the signal was too weak for analysis with confocal microscopy. The FRET signal was therefore measured in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3D). The results show that catalytically inactive PKCα and non-phosphorylated PKCα give rise to a substantially lower FRET signal than wild-type PKCα and autophosphorylated PKCα. This indicates that the PKCα mutants that are sensitive to diacylglycerol also have a different conformation, which may explain the different sensitivity to diacylglycerol. To rule out the possibility that the change in FRET signal was due to degradation of the fusion proteins the expression of the proteins was analyzed by Western blot. All constructs were expressed at the expected size and no sign of increased degradation products could be detected for any of the constructs (Fig. 3E). Coexpression of the V5 Domain Increases the Diacylglycerol Sensitivity of PKCα—Taken together our data are congruent with a model in which the diacylglycerol sensitivity of PKCα is limited by conformational restrictions, which depend on the V5 domain and the phosphorylation of the autophosphorylation sites. This could presumably be mediated by intramolecular interactions involving the V5 domain. If this is the case, breaking this interaction could lead to a more destabilized conformation and hence an increased diacylglycerol sensitivity. To test this hypothesis constructs encoding two variants of the isolated V5 domain fused to ECFP were generated and the effect of the expression of these on the diacylglycerol sensitivity of PKCα was studied. To investigate the role of phosphorylated autophosphorylation sites V5 constructs with these residues mutated to glutamate (αV5EDM) or alanine (αV5ADM) were generated. SK-N-BE(2)C cells were cotransfected with vectors encoding αV5EDM-ECFP, αV5ADM-ECFP or ECFP alone together with a vector encoding PKCαWT-EYFP. Cells expressing both EYFP and ECFP were thereafter examined by confocal microscopy. The localization of PKCαWT-EYFP was followed after addition of DOG (Fig. 4). In 32% of the cells coexpressing αV5EDM-ECFP, PKCαWT-EYFP responded to DOG with an immediate translocation and in 36% of the cells there was a more gradual translocation (Fig. 4, D-F and J). This contrasted the response in cells cotransfected with empty ECFP vector where PKCαWT-EYFP was unresponsive in more than 70% of the cells (Fig. 4, A-C and J). In the remaining cells the translocation of PKCαWT-EYFP was gradual. In only a minute fraction of the cells could an immediate translocation be observed. Thus, coexpression of the phosphorylated isolated PKCα V5 domain enhances the diacylglycerol sensitivity of PKCα. To test whether the effect of the isolated V5 domain is dependent on a negative charge on the autophosphorylation sites the effect of a V5 domain with the sites mutated to alanine (αV5ADM-ECFP) was examined. However, in cells coexpressing αV5ADM-ECFP, PKCαWT-EYFP responded in a similar manner to DOG as in cells coexpressing αV5EDM-ECFP (Fig. 4, G-J). Both V5 constructs were properly expressed as determined by Western blot (Fig. 4K). Thus a negative charge on the autophosphorylation sites is not a prerequisite for an isolated V5 domain to destabilize the more closed conformation of PKCα and making it sensitive to DAG. Rather it is other structures in the V5 domain that are important for disrupting a possible intramolecular interaction. Mutation of Acidic Amino Acids in the V5 Domain Makes PKCα Sensitive to Diacylglycerol—Syndecan-4 is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that can act as a coreceptor with integrins in the formation of focal adhesions. It has a lysine-rich variable region that directly binds to the V5 domain in PKCα and thereby partly activates the enzyme (22Lim S.-T. Longley R.L. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13795-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A putative explanation is that the interaction between syndecan-4 and the PKCα V5 domain destabilizes the enzyme. It is conceivable that the lysine-rich cluster interact"

Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The human small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex (SNAPC) is a general transcription factor that coordinates human snRNA gene transcription for both polymerases (2Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) through its ability to bind to the PSE (3Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.

SNAPC, also known as PTF (4Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

Within this complex, PSE-specific binding is mediated by two of these factors SNAP190, which contains a Myb DNA binding domain (5Wong M.W. Henry R.W. Ma B. Kobayashi R. Klages N. Matthias P. Strubin M. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 368-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and SNAP50, which contains an unorthodox, but evolutionarily conserved zinc finger DNA binding domain (11Jawdekar G. Hanzlowsky A. Hovde S.

Neither SNAP190 nor SNAP50 can bind DNA alone, but instead are coordinated by SNAP43, which interacts with both factors to facilitate formation of a complex that is capable of DNA binding (12Mittal V. Ma B. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1807-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In addition to its role in PSE recognition, SNAP190 plays a pivotal role in snRNA gene transcription by interacting with the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP), stimulating TBP promoter recruitment to TATA-box containing snRNA genes (14Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two regions within SNAP190 have been defined as playing a role in TBP recruitment. One TBP recruitment region (TRR1) is located toward the N terminus (15Ma B. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8067-8078Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is adjacent to the region involved in SNAPC assembly with SNAP19 and SNAP43 (16Ma B. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5027-5035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A second TBP recruitment region (TRR2) is located within the Myb DNA binding domain and was proposed to interact with the TBP DNA binding domain (13Hinkley C.S. Hirsch H.A. Gu L. LaMere B. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); these interactions are likely stabilized by adjacent binding of both factors at the PSE and TATA box, respectively. SNAP190 is also a direct target of the transcriptional activator protein Oct-1 (17Ford E. Strubin M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3528-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Hovde S. Hinkley C.S. Strong K. Brooks A. Gu L. Henry R.W. Geiger J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2772-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which binds to an octamer sequence in the distal sequence element of human snRNA genes.As a central player in snRNA gene transcription, SNAP190 is also targeted for regulation through post-translational modification. For example, SNAP190 is phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro, and in part, phosphorylation is mediated by the protein kinase CK2 that associates with and phosphorylates the N-terminal half of SNAP190 predominately at serine residues (19Gu L. Esselman W.J. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27697-27704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). CK2 associates with other components of the RNA polymerase III transcriptional machinery, including the Brf1-TFIIIB complex (20Johnston I.M. Allison S.J. Morton J.P. Schramm L. Scott P.H. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3757-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), as well as with RNA polymerase III itself (21Hu P. Wu S. Hernandez N. Mol Cell. 2003; 12: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of CK2 association with these components of the RNA polymerase III transcriptional machinery are complex. CK2 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase III stimulates U6 snRNA gene transcription (21Hu P. Wu S. Hernandez N. Mol Cell. 2003; 12: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, during mitosis CK2 can instead down-regulate U6 transcription by phosphorylating Bdp1 (22Hu P. Samudre K. Wu S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a component shared by both Brf1-TFIIIB and Brf2-TFIIIB complexes (23Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Bdp1 disrupts its promoter association (22Hu P. Samudre K. Wu S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and may ensure that RNA polymerase III recruitment or promoter stabilization by Bdp1 does not occur at inappropriate points in the cell cycle.A role for SNAPC phosphorylation in snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase III has not been described (21Hu P. Wu S. Hernandez N. Mol Cell. 2003; 12: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Hu P. Samudre K. Wu S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, CK2 does inhibit DNA binding by a partial SNAPC, assembled from components expressed in Escherichia coli (19Gu L. Esselman W.J. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27697-27704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of CK2 was suppressed by cooperative promoter binding by the partial SNAPC and TBP on DNA containing a juxtaposed PSE and TATA box, but not on TATA-less probes, suggesting that CK2 phosphorylation of SNAPC was likely to be detrimental for RNA polymerase II snRNA gene transcription. Indeed, CK2 inhibited U1 snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase II, probably due to impaired SNAPC function at these genes (19Gu L. Esselman W.J. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27697-27704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The current study further implicates CK2 in the regulation of SNAPC for PSE binding and U6 transcription by RNA polymerase III through the phosphorylation SNAP190 at two sites. The first site is located in the N-terminal region (amino acids 20-63) overlapping with TBP-recruitment region 1 (15Ma B. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8067-8078Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The second site constitutes the major site of phosphorylation by recombinant CK2 and is located in the serine-rich region (amino acids 514-545) downstream of the Myb-DNA binding domain and TBP-recruitment region 2. The juxtaposition of phosphorylated sites adjacently to key functional domains within SNAP190 suggests that SNAPC function is allosterically regulated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Protein Expression-In vitro transcription and translation of SNAPC subunits were performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TnT, Promega), and 1 μg of each pCite2a-derived plasmid encoding full-length or truncated SNAPC subunits as previously described (16Ma B. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5027-5035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Translation reactions were performed in the presence of either [35S]methionine or [γ-32P]ATP, and proteins were recovered by anti-SNAP43 immunoprecipitation for visualization by autoradiography. The recombinant partial SNAPC used for functional studies was assembled by co-expression of GST-SNAP190-(1-719) from the pSBET-SNAP190-(1-719) plasmid along with full-length his-tagged SNAP43 and HA-tagged SNAP50 from the plasmid pET21-HisSNAP43-HASNAP50 in E. coli BL21 DE3. Recombinant complexes were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and bound proteins were released from the GST tag by thrombin cleavage. Recovered complexes were then dialyzed against Dignam buffer D-80 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl) prior to in vitro transcription and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), as described below. As indicated in the figure legends, additional complexes containing SNAP190 with further truncations or amino acid substitutions were expressed and purified similarly. Note that full-length SNAP190 contains 1469 amino acids, and unless otherwise noted, SNAP190-(1-719) is hereafter referred to as wild type for the purposes of comparison with these mutant SNAP190-(1-719) derivatives.In Vitro Kinase Assays-For the experiments presented in Figs. 1B and 4, ∼3 μg of the indicated GST SNAP190 fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μl) and were washed extensively with HEMGT-150 buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 150 mm KCl) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium bis-sulfate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. In vitro kinase assays were performed directly on the beads using 10 units of recombinant CK2 (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 8 nm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were again washed with HEMGT-150 buffer to remove unincorporated isotope and CK2. Phosphorylated GST-SNAP190-(1-719) was digested with trypsin, and the resultant fragments were separated by two-dimensional TLC as described (19Gu L. Esselman W.J. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27697-27704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Alternatively, phosphorylated GST-SNAP190 proteins were left undigested for analyses by 15% SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, GST-SNAP190 proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue prior to autoradiography to detected phosphorylation.FIGURE 4The SNAP190 serine-rich region is a major target for CK2 phosphorylation. A, a schematic representation of SNAP190 and the position of the CK2 sites (red) relative to other functional regions are shown (top panel). Myb domain, Myb DNA binding domain; TRR1, TBP-interacting region 1; TRR2, TBP-interacting region 2; OIR, Oct-1 interacting region; 43/19, SNAP43 and SNAP19 interacting region; and 45, SNAP45 interacting region (modified from Ref. 16Ma B. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5027-5035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The wavy vertical line around position 719 indicates the C terminus of the truncated SNAP190 protein used for these studies. Sequences of the SNAP190 amino acids 501-513 and amino acids 514-545 are also given. The locations of amino acid substitutions introduced within the two CK2 targeted regions are shown. B, the serine-rich region of SNAP190-(1-719) is extensively phosphorylated by CK2. GST-SNAP190 fusion proteins that lack the CK2 phosphorylation sites were expressed in E. coli and were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads for in vitro kinase assays with recombinant CK2. A schematic representation of the various GST-SNAP190 fusion proteins tested is shown on the left. Phosphorylation signals were detected by autoradiography (lane 1), and the amount of GST-SNAP190 proteins used in each reaction was detected by staining with Coomassie Blue (lane 2). Deletion of the serine-rich region strongly diminishes SNAP190-(1-719) phosphorylation by recombinant CK2. C, the CK2 recognition motifs within the serine-rich region are critical for SNAP190 phosphorylation. GST-SNAP190-(1-719) fusion proteins harboring mutations in the putative CK2 recognition sequences were subjected to in vitro kinase assays with recombinant CK2. Phosphorylation signals were detected by autoradiography (top) and total protein was measured by Coomassie staining (bottom). The corresponding locations of the indicated amino acid substitutions are shown in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphopeptide Mapping-To map SNAP190 phosphorylation sites, ∼1 μg of GST-SNAP190-(1-719) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was treated with 50 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract in a total volume of 200 μl adjusted with HEMGT-150 buffer. After 1-h incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed extensively with HEMGT-150 buffer and a kinase assay was performed in the presence of 8 nm [γ-32P]ATP and 1 mm unlabeled ATP. After extensive washing with HEMGT-150 buffer, phosphorylated SNAP190-(1-719) was then digested with sequence grade trypsin (Promega) followed either by phosphopeptide purification through a gallium spin column (24Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Purified peptides were directly analyzed or were dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) prior to analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Perseptive Biosystems, Inc., Farmingham, MA) in a positive ion reflector mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. The purified peptides were also subjected to Ba(OH)2 treatment for β-elimination (25Jiang X. Wang Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15567-15576Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) prior to liquid chromatography using the Waters CapLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) coupled with quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometric analysis (Q-TOF MS/MS) using the LCQ DECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) through the Picoview nanospray source (New Objectives, Cambridge, MA).SNAPC Immunodepletion and in Vitro Transcription Assays-To deplete SNAPC from HeLa nuclear extracts, 150 μl of extract was incubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads pre-coupled with rabbit pre-immune, anti-SNAP43 (CS48) (2Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), or anti-SNAP190 (CS402) (5Wong M.W. Henry R.W. Ma B. Kobayashi R. Klages N. Matthias P. Strubin M. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 368-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Extracts were then used for in vitro U6 transcription as described previously (1Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For the reconstitution reactions whose results are depicted in Fig. 6A, the transcription reactions were performed in a total volume of 36 μl containing 1 μg of the DNA template (pU6/Hae/RA.2) with either 8 μl of untreated extract or 14 μl of SNAPC-depleted extracts. The amounts and constituents of the recombinant mini-SNAP complexes tested are indicated in the figure legend. U6 transcripts were analyzed by RNase T1 protection as described previously (1Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For Fig. 6 (B and C), recombinant mini-SNAPC mS or mSΔC was preincubated with Dignam buffer D either with or without recombinant CK2 and ATP for 30 min at room temperature. In vitro transcriptions were initiated by the addition of transcription buffers, nucleoside triphosphates, 1 μg of DNA template, and either 8 μl of untreated HeLa nuclear extracts or 14 μl of SNAPC-depleted extract, and reactions were incubated for an additional 60 min at 30 °C.FIGURE 6Phosphorylation of the SNAP190 serine-rich region inhibits U6 transcription. A, the CK2 target regions within SNAP190 are not essential for U6 transcription. Partial complexes containing His-tagged SNAP43, HA-tagged SNAP50, and various GST-tagged SNAP190 molecules that lack CK2 phosphorylation sites were assembled by co-expression in E. coli. The complexes labeled mS, mSΔN, mSΔC, and mSΔ(N+C) contain SNAP190-(1-719), SNAP190-(63-719), SNAP190-(1-505), and SNAP190-(63-505), respectively. In vitro U6 transcription assays were performed using untreated HeLa cell nuclear extract (lane 1) or extracts that were depleted of endogenous SNAPC using anti-SNAP43 antibodies (lanes 2-14). Transcription was reconstituted by addition of ∼1, 3, and 10 ng of each complex, as indicated. The reaction shown in lane 2 contains no added SNAPC. The correctly initiated transcripts and an irrelevant RNA handling control are labeled U6 and IC, respectively. B, SNAPC phosphorylation inhibits U6 transcription. In vitro U6 transcription experiments were performed using HeLa nuclear extracts that were depleted of endogenous SNAPC (lanes 1-4). Transcription was initiated by addition of ∼10 ng of the untreated mS complex (lane 2) or complex pretreated with 100 units of CK2 plus ATP for 30 min prior to the initiation of transcription (lane 3). Alternatively, transcription was initiated by concomitant addition of the mS complex along with CK2 plus ATP (lane 4). C, the mS and mSΔC complexes exhibit differential responsiveness to CK2. Purified mS and mSΔC complexes were preincubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of Dignam buffer D containing 20 units of recombinant CK2 and 1 mm ATP for 30 min followed by in vitro U6 transcription assays using HeLa nuclear extracts depleted of endogenous SNAPC. As indicated, additional reactions that initially lacked CK2 and ATP were complemented with CK2 and ATP (0 min preincubation) immediately prior to their addition to transcription reactions. The ratios of the correctly initiated U6 transcripts relative to the internal RNA handling control for each reaction were calculated (actual U6 values are shown above each bar). The value for the SNAPC-depleted extract lacking any added SNAPC was then subtracted, and these adjusted values were normalized to that observed for the IgG treated nuclear extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-PSE-specific DNA binding by SNAPC was assayed by EMSA as described previously (3Sadowski C.L.

Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For the experiments presented in Fig. 5A (panel a), ∼20 ng of purified mini-SNAP complexes was preincubated alone or with 5 or 50 units of recombinant CK2 and/or 1 mm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C, as indicated. EMSAs were then performed by addition of the radiolabeled DNA probes, and reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. To determine whether CK2 could affect SNAPC after DNA binding (Fig. 5A, panel b), mini-SNAP complexes were first incubated with DNA probes for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, 5 or 50 units of recombinant CK2 and 1 mm ATP were added, and reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were fractionated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (39:1) in TGE running buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA).FIGURE 5Phosphorylation within SNAP190-(506-719) negatively regulates DNA binding by SNAPC. A, PSE-specific DNA binding by partial SNAP complexes were assayed by EMSA in the presence or absence of CK2. Approximately 20 ng of the purified mini-SNAP complexes mS (lanes 2-7) and mSΔC (lanes 8-13) were preincubated either alone (lanes 2 and 8) or with 5 units (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) and 50 units of recombinant CK2 (lanes 4, 7, 10, and 13) plus 1 mm ATP (lanes 5-7 and 11-14). After 30 min at 30 °C, DNA binding was initiated by addition of a radiolabeled DNA probe containing a wild-type mouse U6 PSE with a mutant human U6 TATA box, and reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min at 30 °C (left panel). Alternatively, the mS (lanes 15-17) and mSΔC(lanes 18-20) complexes were preincubated with the DNA probe for 30 min at 30 °C, prior to addition of 5 units (lanes 16 and 19) and 50 units of CK2 (lanes 17, 20, and 21) plus 1 mm ATP (lanes 15-21), followed by an additional 30 min incubation at 30 °C (right panel). The reaction shown in lane 1 contains probe alone, and the reaction in lanes 14 and 21 contained only 50 units CK2 and 1 mm ATP. The positions of the protein-DNA complexes are indicated. B, the charged residues flanking the SNAP190 serine-rich region are required for CK2 inhibition of DNA binding by SNAPC. PSE-specific DNA binding by partial SNAP complexes (∼20 ng each) harboring wild-type or mutant SNAP190-(1-719) were assayed by EMSA in the presence or absence of CK2. PSE-specific DNA binding by the mS (R-Q)(lanes 5-7) and mS (E-A) (lanes 8-10) complexes that contain amino acid substitutions of the arginine-rich and acidic regions, respectively, were compared with the wild type SNAP190-(1-719)-containing mS complex (lanes 2-4) in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of CK2 (5 and 50 units, as indicated).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSTwo Regions within SNAP190-(1-719) are phosphorylated by CK2-Previous experiments demonstrated that endogenous CK2 associates with SNAPC and can efficiently phosphorylate the largest SNAPC subunit, SNAP190 (19Gu L. Esselman W.J. Henry R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27697-27704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To determine whether the presence of a particular SNAPC subunit is required for efficient SNAP190 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of recombinant SNAPC subunits was examined for proteins that were expressed individually or were co-translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysates. During translation, proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine to serve as markers for subunit expression or with [γ-32P]ATP to detect phosphorylation by kinases resident in the extract. SNAPC proteins were specifically recovered by immunoprecipitation for analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In these assays, SNAP190 was efficiently phosphorylated regardless of whether other SNAPC subunits were co-expressed (data not shown). SNAP190 phosphorylation was sensitive to CK2 inhibitors and could be supported by GTP (data not shown), a hallmark of CK2, suggesting that CK2 contributes to SNAP190 phosphorylation in this context, although other kinases may also target SNAP190.To identify the regions of SNAP190 that are phosphorylated when it is assembled within SNAPC, truncated SNAP190 proteins were co-translated along with SNAP43 and SNAP19, and the various partial complexes were recovered by anti-SNAP43 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A). Because preliminary data indicated that SNAP45 and SNAP50 were dispensable for efficient SNAPC assembly, these subunits were omitted from these analyses for simplicity. As with full-length SNAP190-(1-1469) (data not shown), strong SNAP190 phosphorylation was observed with SNAP190 containing amino acids 1-719 (lane 8), but only modest phosphorylation was detected for SNAP190-(1-505) or SNAP190-(1-216) when co-expressed with SNAP43 and SNAP19 (lanes 9 and 10). Therefore, robust SNAP190 phosphorylation requires the N terminus of SNAP190 containing amino acids 1-719. Interestingly, the pattern of SNAP43 phosphorylation in these assays was parallel to that seen with SNAP190; the majority of SNAP43 recovered in these assays was phosphorylated when co-expressed with SNAP190-(1-719) but not with SNAP190-(1-505) or SNAP190-(1-216). Unlike SNAP190, SNAP43 was not efficiently phosphorylated when expressed individually (lane 6) or co-translated with SNAP19 alone (lane 7). The assembly of SNAP190 into a complex with SNAP43 and SNAP19 was not disrupted by truncation of the SNAP190 C-terminal region, because SNAP43 interacts with the N-terminal region of SNAP190 (16Ma B. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5027-5035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, SNAP190 may also direct kinase activity toward SNAP43, with SNAP19 likely playing an auxiliary role by facilitating the association between SNAP43 and SNAP190 (10Henry R.W. Mittal V. Ma B. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).To determine whether similar regions in endogenous SNAP190 and recombinant SNAP190 can be phosphorylated, endogenous SNAP190 was immunopurified from HeLa nuclear extracts for subsequent in vitro phosphorylation by endogenous SNAPC-associated kinases. Phosphopeptide mapping for full-length SNAP190 was then performe"

To perform their autonomous functions, immune cells must rely on the same basic organizational features that apply to all cells, although immune cells often exhibit remarkable degrees of specialization and adaptation. The study of these specializations has lagged behind advances in understanding the immune response and cell biology individually. As a result, there are great opportunities, but also great challenges, for new conceptual discoveries by taking a more cell-biological approach to probing the function of the immune system."

Challenge the immune system, and you might well induce a vigorous response. Challenge an immunologist, and you can be confident of eliciting something rather similar. Indeed, our rate of progress in understanding the immune system has been anything but sluggish over the past few decades. This has encouraged a mood of optimism that new vaccines for infectious diseases and immune-based therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases are just around the corner. Yet despite this brisk pace of discovery and some enticing glimpses of how the immune system might be manipulated, there is much that is clearly left to explore about its inner workings. In this special issue, we consider a selection of fundamental immunological questions that still test investigators.

As Casanova and Abel explain (p. [617][2]), the genetic study of human primary immunodeficiencies is an emerging field that is revealing surprises about our evolving relationship with the world of pathogens. Kioussis and Georgopoulos (p. 620) discuss the epigenetic rules that govern lymphocyte function and development, and, Reiner et al. (p. [622][3]) frame some of the most pertinent issues in T cell fate determination. Cell biology and immunology have long been intimate partners, and Mellman (p. 625) uses the study of antigen presentation to explain how discoveries in basic cell biology continue to underpin our understanding of the immune system. Finally, Sakaguchi and Powrie (p. [627][4]) reveal just how much there is still to learn about the regulatory T cell and its power in preventing overzealous immune responses and autoimmunity. In News, Leslie (p. [614][5]) describes how immunologists have struggled to understand the purpose of mast cells, and Cohen (p. 612) updates the daring efforts of gene therapists to reboot the human immune system with cells impervious to HIV. Science 's STKE focuses on some molecular challenges for immunologists ( ). Linden describes how the adaptor protein Act1 mediates interleukin-17 receptor signaling. Serfling et al. discuss the importance of NFAT transcription factors to memory lymphocytes. Finally, Wattenberg and Raben describe the negative regulation of various immune responses by diacylglycerol kinase.

We are still learning about how immune cells move around the body, and in the research section a Report by Auffrey et al. (p. 666) describes a subset of monocytes that patrol the surfaces of blood vessels for damage and inflammation, contrasting their behavior with that of typical leukocytes. Mueller et al. (p. [670][6]) offer up some intriguing evidence that lymphoid organs “close up shop” for new business during an immune response, by using chemokine regulation to prevent the admission of circulating naive lymphocytes. In research that may shed some evolutionary light on an ancient system, Chen et al. (p. 678 and see related News item) describe how the social amoeba Dictyostelium uses specialized cells akin to phagocytes in animals. Finally, Carmody et al. (p. 675) reveal the means by which normally potent signals mediated by the innate immune Toll-like receptors are placated by blocking ubiquity-nation. With so much left to discover about our immune system, there seems little doubt that immunologists will find plenty to challenge them in the years to come.
