https://openalex.org/W2052840755,Inhibition of cyclooxygenase by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the periphery is commonly accepted as the primary mechanism by which these agents produce a selective attenuation of pain (analgesia). NSAIDs are now shown to exert a direct spinal action by blocking the excessive sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) induced by the activation of spinal glutamate and substance P receptors. These findings demonstrate that the analgesic effects of NSAIDs can be dissociated from their anti-inflammatory actions. Spinal prostanoids are thus critical for the augmented processing of pain information at the spinal level.
https://openalex.org/W2089033636,"The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (dsRNA-PK) is thought to be a key mediator of the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of interferons (IFNs). Studies examining the physiological function of the kinase suggest that it participates in cell growth and differentiation by regulating protein synthesis. Autophosphorylation and consequent activation of dsRNA-PK in vitro and in vivo result in phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) and inhibition of protein synthesis. Expression of a functionally defective mutant of human dsRNA-PK in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in malignant transformation, suggesting that dsRNA-PK may function as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis."

Factors that stimulate collateral formation are expected to have ameliorating effects on myocardial infarction. In a canine experimental myocardial infarct model, intracoronary injection of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) improved cardiac systolic function and reduced infarct size. Treatment with bFGF increased the number of arterioles and capillaries in the infarct. Thus, the angiogenic action of bFGF might lead to a reduction in infarct size. The application of bFGF might bring about a therapeutic modality for the salvage of infarcted myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2008333101,"Expression of oncogenic ras in PC12 cells causes neuronal differentiation and sustained protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p42erk2 and p44erk1. Oncogenic N-ras-induced neuronal differentiation is inhibited by compounds that block ERK protein tyrosine phosphorylation or ERK activity, indicating that ERKs are not only activated by p21ras but serve as the primary downstream effectors of p21ras. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor or fibroblast growth factor results in neuronal differentiation and in a sustained elevation of p21ras activity, of ERK activity, and of ERK tyrosine phosphorylation. Epidermal growth factor, which does not cause neuronal differentiation, stimulates only transient (< 1 hr) activation of p21ras and ERKs. These data indicate that transient activation of p21ras and, consequently, ERKs is not sufficient for induction of neuronal differentiation. Prolonged ERK activity is required: a consequence of sustained activation of p21ras by the growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2074340804,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor forms a cation-selective channel with a high calcium permeability and sensitivity to channel block by extracellular magnesium. These properties, which are believed to be important for the induction of long-term changes in synaptic strength, are imparted by asparagine residues in a putative channel-forming segment of the protein, transmembrane 2 (TM2). In the NR1 subunit, replacement of this asparagine by a glutamine residue decreases calcium permeability of the channel and slightly reduces magnesium block. The same substitution in NR2 subunits strongly reduces magnesium block and increases the magnesium permeability but barely affects calcium permeability. These asparagines are in a position homologous to the site in the TM2 region (Q/R site) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors that is occupied by either glutamine (Q) or arginine (R) and that controls divalent cation permeability of the AMPA receptor channel. Hence AMPA and NMDA receptor channels contain common structural motifs in their TM2 segments that are responsible for some of their ion selectivity and conductance properties."
https://openalex.org/W1487443561,"Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized in mammals where it acts as a signal molecule for neurotransmission, vasorelaxation, and cytotoxicity. The NO synthases isolated from brain and cytokine-activated macrophages are FAD- and FMN-containing flavoproteins that display considerable sequence homology to NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. However, the nature of their catalytic centers is unknown. We have found that both isoenzymes contain 2 mol of iron-protoporphyrin IX/mol of enzyme homodimer. The optical and EPR spectroscopic properties of the heme groups were found to be remarkably similar to those of high-spin cytochrome P-450. The heme iron in the resting NO synthase is ferric and five-coordinate with a cysteine thiolate as the proximal axial ligand. In addition, the EPR spectra of the resting NO synthases contained a free radical signal attributable to a bound flavin semiquinone that appeared to interact magnetically with the ferric heme iron. NO production was inhibited by carbon monoxide, implying a role for the heme groups in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2039864751,"The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein is an active transporter that pumps cytotoxic drugs out of cells. Expression of P-glycoprotein is also associated with a volume-activated chloride channel. Here we address the relationship between these two functions. Drug transport requires ATP hydrolysis while, in contrast, ATP binding is sufficient to enable activation of the chloride channel. The chloride channel and drug transport activities of P-glycoprotein appear to reflect two distinct functional states of the protein that can be interconverted by changes in tonicity. Transportable drugs prevent channel activation but have no effect on channel activity once it has been preactivated by hypotonicity. The transport and channel functions of P-glycoprotein have been separated by directed mutations in the nucleotide-binding domains of the protein. These data provide further evidence that P-glycoprotein is bifunctional with both transport and channel activities. Implications for the design of chemotherapeutic drugs and for the function of the related cystic fibrosis gene product, CFTR, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1588749554,"Neuropeptide-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of specific components in Swiss 3T3 cells was investigated using monoclonal antibodies directed against the src transformation-associated substrates p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a novel type of cytosolic tyrosine kinase, and p130. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with the mitogenic peptides bombesin, vasopressin, and endothelin caused a striking increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK, as judged either by anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) Western blots of anti-p125FAK immunoprecipitates, or by anti-p125FAK immunoblots of anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates. Bombesin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was detectable within seconds and concentration-dependent (half-maximum effect of 0.3 nM). Neuropeptides also stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a second component of M(r) 130,000, previously identified as the major p130 phosphotyrosyl protein in src-transformed cells. Bombesin stimulated p130 tyrosine phosphorylation with kinetics and concentration dependence similar to those observed for p125FAK. This is the first report to identify substrates for neuropeptide-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation; the finding that one of these substrates is a tyrosine kinase suggests the existence of a novel signal transduction pathway in the action of mitogenic neuropeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2091833091,"Cystic flbrosis is a fatal genetic disorder which afflicts 50,000 people worldwide. A viable animal model would be invaluable for investigating and combating this disease. The mouse cystic flbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene was disrupted in embryonal stem cells using an insertional gene targeting vector. Germ-line chimaeras were derived and the offspring of heterozygous crosses studied. These homozygous mutant mice survive beyond weaning. In vivo electrophysiology demonstrates the predicted defect in chloride ion transport in these mice and can distinguish between each genotype. Histological analysis detects important hallmarks of human disease pathology, including abnormalities of the colon, lung and vas deferens. This insertional mouse mutation provides a valid model system for the development and testing of therapies for cystic fibrosis patients."
https://openalex.org/W1569704448,"The cellular receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) is a glycolipid-anchored three-domain membrane protein playing a central role in pericellular plasminogen activation. We have found that urokinase (uPA) can cleave its receptor between domains 1 and 2 generating a cell-associated uPAR variant without ligand-binding properties. In extracts of U937 cells there are two uPAR variants which after complete deglycosylation have apparent molecular masses of 35,000 and 27,000. Analysis with monoclonal antibodies showed that these variants represented the intact uPAR and a two-domain form, uPAR(2+3), lacking ligand-binding domain 1. Trypsin treatment showed that both variants are present on the outside of the cells. Addition to the culture medium of an anticatalytic monoclonal antibody to uPA inhibited the formation of the uPAR(2+3), indicating that uPA is involved in its generation. Purified uPAR can be cleaved directly by uPA as well as by plasmin. The uPA-catalyzed cleavage does not require binding of the protease to the receptor through its epidermal growth factor-like receptor-binding domain, since low molecular weight uPA that lacks this domain also cleaves uPAR. This unusual reaction in which a specific binding protein is proteolytically inactivated by its own ligand may represent a regulatory step in the plasminogen activation cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1990589909,"Seven lines were isolated with P element insertions in the cytogenetic vicinity of the learning and memory gene, rutabaga, from an enhancer detector screen designed to mark genes preferentially expressed in mushroom bodies. Six of these lines performed poorly in learning and memory tests, and several failed to complement an existing rutabaga allele. Molecular cloning revealed that the P elements were inserted in the putative promoter of the rutabaga gene. RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression of the rutabaga gene, which encodes a Ca2+/calmodulin-responsive adenylyl cyclase, is markedly elevated in the mushroom bodies of normal flies and that the insertion elements compromised its expression in the new rutabaga mutants. The reisolation of a known learning and memory gene, but with a heretofore unknown expression pattern, strongly supports the postulate that mushroom bodies are principal sites mediating olfactory learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2061592889,"Regulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is unusual in that phosphorylated channels require cytosolic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to open. The CFTR contains two regions predicted to be nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs); site-directed mutations in each NBD have now been shown to alter the relation between ATP concentration and channel activity, which indicates that ATP stimulates the channel by direct interaction with both NBDs. The two NBDs are not, however, functionally equivalent: adenosine diphosphate (ADP) competitively inhibited the channel by interacting with NBD2 but not by interacting with NBD1. Four cystic fibrosis-associated mutations in the NBDs reduced absolute chloride channel activity, and one mutation also decreased the potency with which ATP stimulates channel activity. Dysfunction of ATP-dependent stimulation through the NBDs may be the basis for defective CFTR chloride channel activity in some cystic fibrosis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2029804359,"Ion channels directly activated by cGMP mediate the light response in retinal rods. Several components of the enzyme cascade controlling cGMP concentration are regulated, but there are no accepted mechanisms for modulation of the response of the channel to cGMP. Here we report evidence that in excised patches an endogenous protein phosphatase converts the channel from a state with low cGMP sensitivity to a state with almost 3 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity in the predicted physiological range of cGMP concentration. The action of this endogenous phosphatase was blocked by specific serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors (microcystin-LR, okadaic acid, and calyculin A). An increase in apparent agonist affinity also was produced by addition of purified protein phosphatase 1. In contrast, protein phosphatase 2A decreased apparent agonist affinity, suggesting that two phosphorylation sites may regulate the agonist sensitivity of the channel in a reciprocal manner. This regulation may be involved in fine-tuning the light response or in light or dark adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2093837731,"To determine the role of the floor plate (FP) in CNS development, I have used labeling techniques, including immunolabeling, to analyze cyclops mutant embryos, which lack the FP. Except for the anterior brain, the mutant phenotype is almost exclusively confined to the vicinity of the ventral CNS midline. In the midbrain, the number of ventral neurons is reduced and cell patterning is disturbed. In contrast, the neuronal arrangement in the spinal cord is almost normal, including in particular both primary and secondary motoneurons. Longitudinal axonal bundles are disorganized in both the brain and spinal cord. Laser ablating the FP in wild-type embryos locally phenocopies cyclops axonal disturbances, and transplanting wild-type FP precursor cells into mutants locally rescues the disturbances. These results demonstrate a significant role for the FP in pathfinding and fasciculation by axons in situ, especially during their longitudinal courses."
https://openalex.org/W1640455274,"Cyclins regulate cell cycle progression by complexing with and activating cdc2 or related kinases. PRAD1/cyclin D1 is a recently discovered putative oncogene in several types of human tumors and may regulate G1-S phase progression. We have cloned a related human cDNA, called cyclin D3, from a placental cDNA library by cross-hybridization with PRAD1. In synchronized HeLa cells, the mRNA levels of PRAD1 and cyclin D3 were regulated reciprocally through the cell cycle: cyclin D3 mRNA levels peaked in S phase, where PRAD1 mRNA was lowest in S. In normal human mammary epithelial (70N) cells synchronized by growth factor deprivation and subsequent growth factor stimulation, PRAD1 expression peaked in G1 and declined before S phase, while cyclin D3 expression rose later in G1 and remained elevated in S. Therefore, the close relationship (53.1% identity) between PRAD1 and cyclin D3 does not necessarily imply redundant functions of these candidate G1 cyclins; they may have distinct roles in progression from G1 through S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1542464099,"Rat hepatic cells respond to interleukin (IL) -1, IL-6, and dexamethasone treatment by increasing the transcription rate of acute-phase plasma protein genes. The same conditions lead to changes in the expression of CAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) isoforms which are specific to the hepatic cell line. To identify the relationship between C/EBP isoforms and acute-phase protein gene activation, the hormone-specific expression of C/EBP alpha, beta, and delta was determined in H-35 and HTC cells and was compared to acute-phase liver. C/EBP beta was found to be the principal isoform in hepatoma cells and to be strongly stimulated by cytokines and dexamethasone in H-35 cells. Transactivating functions were observed for all three C/EBP isoforms by cotransfection of CAT gene reporter constructs containing cytokine and glucocorticoid response elements of acute-phase protein genes and expression plasmids for mouse C/EBP alpha, beta, and delta into rat and human hepatoma cells. The degree of C/EBP-mediated transactivation was, however, extremely variable among the different regulatory elements. Transcription run-on reactions with nuclei from transiently transfected H-35 cells indicated that cotransfected C/EBP beta increases basal expression of reporter gene constructs as well as the dexamethasone-mediated stimulation of constructs containing the glucocorticoid response elements of the rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene, but did not accelerate or enhance hormone-dependent transcription activation of reporter gene plasmids containing the IL-6 regulatory element of the beta-fibrinogen gene. Activation of the reporter gene constructs appeared to be temporally and quantitatively correlated with the amount of nuclear C/EBP as determined by two-dimensional Western and Southwestern blot analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2083337920,"The transcriptional antiterminator protein BglG inhibits transcription termination of the bgl operon in Escherichia coli when it is in the nonphosphorylated state. The BglG protein is now shown to exist in two configurations, an active, dimeric nonphosphorylated form and an inactive, monomeric phosphorylated form. The migration of BglG on native polyacrylamide gels was consistent with it existing as a dimer when nonphosphorylated and as a monomer when phosphorylated. Only the nonphosphorylated dimer was found to bind to the target RNA. When the dimerization domain of the λ repressor was replaced with BglG, the resulting chimera behaved like an intact λ repressor in its ability to repress λ gene expression, which suggests that BglG dimerizes in vivo. Repression by the λ-BglG hybrid was significantly reduced by BglF, the BglG kinase, an effect that was relieved by conditions that stimulate dephosphorylation of BglG by BglF. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation of BglG regulate its activity by controlling its dimeric state."
https://openalex.org/W1565017492,"Activation of many single-transmembrane receptors requires ligand-induced receptor oligomerization. We have examined the oligomerization of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor, NPR-A, using epitope-tagged receptor in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Unlike other single-transmembrane receptors, NPR-A oligomerized in a ligand-independent fashion. Extracellular receptor sequences were both necessary and sufficient for oligomer formation. NPR-A was also able to oligomerize with the related natriuretic peptide receptor, NPR-B. A truncated NPR-A lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain blocked activation of the full-length receptor, presumably through formation of an inactive heteromer. These results indicate that oligomerization of this single-transmembrane receptor is important for the transduction of a conformational change across the plasma membrane but are not consistent with models in which natriuretic peptide receptor oligomerization serves merely to bring intracellular domains together."
https://openalex.org/W2014677270,"Growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases can form stable associations with intracellular proteins that contain src homology (SH) 2 domains, including the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (Pl)-3 kinase. The activation of this enzyme by growth factors is evaluated in PC12 pheochromocytorna cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing the pp140c-trk nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor (3T3-c-trk). NGF causes the rapid stimulation of PI-3 kinase activity detected in anti-phosphotyrosine, but not in anti-trk, immunoprecipitates. This effect coincides with the tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins, with molecular masses of of 100 kd and 110 kd, that coimmunoprecipitate with p85. Similar phosphorylation patterns are induced when an immobilized fusion protein containing the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85 is used to precipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Thus, although NGF produces the rapid activation of PI-3 kinase through a mechanism that involves tyrosine phosphorylation, there is no evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, or for its Iigand-dependent association with the NGF receptor. Perhaps another phosphoprotein may link the NGF receptor to this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1512813342,"Topoisomerases are essential enzymes for DNA metabolism in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In human cells, DNA topoisomerase II enzyme activity can be modulated by both viral transformation and changes in proliferation status. To identify elements important for regulation of topoisomerase II alpha gene expression, genomic DNA clones covering the 5'-end of the gene were isolated. The intron/exon structure of a 2.5-kilobase region encompassing the translation start site was determined. Transcription was found to initiate at multiple sites clustered around 90 base pairs 5' to the ATG initiation codon. Transient expression of chimeric topoisomerase II-reporter gene constructs in HeLa cells revealed that the 5'-flanking region exhibited promoter activity. The region -90 to -1 upstream of the major transcription start site was shown by deletion analysis to include a promoter. This minimal promoter lacks a TATA box, is moderately GC-rich, and contains a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides; characteristic of a housekeeping gene promoter. Maximal promoter activity was observed using a fragment extending to position -562. Putative regulatory elements are contained within and immediately upstream of the minimal promoter region. The regulatory region of the topoisomerase II alpha gene identified here is similar in basic structure to those of the human thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase alpha genes, which are also controlled by proliferation-specific factors."
https://openalex.org/W1512506249,"CD36 (glycoprotein IV or IIIB) is an integral plasma membrane protein of wide cellular distribution and functions as a receptor site for thrombospondin (TSP), an adhesive protein important in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. OKM5, a monoclonal anti-CD36 antibody, has been reported to block CD36 cell adhesive functions suggesting that the OKM5 epitope on CD36 is functionally important. A panel of 10 synthetic CD36 peptides was made. One peptide, P139-155, specifically inhibited the immunoadsorption of CD36 by OKM5, and P139-155 was directly immunoadsorbed by OKM5, indicating that CD36 sequence 139-155 represents part of the OKM5 epitope. TSP bound to immobilized P139-155 in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. Surprisingly, P139-155 significantly augmented, instead of inhibited, binding of CD36 to TSP. This peptide did not induce platelet aggregation but augmented ADP- and collagen-induced aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Another CD36 peptide, P93-110, which had no effect on OKM5 immunoadsorption, blocked binding of CD36 to immobilized TSP and partially inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. P93-110 by itself did not bind to TSP; however, in the presence of P139-155, there was a marked enhancement of P93-110 binding to TSP, with a stoichiometry consistent with the trimeric nature of TSP. The data suggest that CD36-TSP interaction is a two-step process; the sequence 139-155 region of CD36 binds first to TSP, triggering a change in TSP to reveal a second site, which binds the 93-110 region of CD36 with high affinity. CD36 peptides can be used as stimulators or inhibitors in cellular adhesive events involving TSP-CD36 interaction. Conformational changes leading to the exposure or activation of high affinity binding sites may occur in both the receptor and the ligand upon cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1536772335,"The adhesion molecule on glia, AMOG, an integral cell surface glycoprotein highly expressed by cerebellar astrocytes and involved in neuron to astrocyte adhesion and granule neuron migration (Antonicek, H., Persohn, E., and Schachner, M. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 104, 1587-1595) has been identified as a beta 2 subunit isoform of the mouse sodium pump (Gloor, S., Antonicek, H., Sweadner, K.J., Pagliusi, S., Frank, R., Moos, M., and Schachner, M. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 165-174). Here we demonstrate that AMOG/beta 2 expressed by cRNA injection in Xenopus oocytes is capable of combining with endogenous Xenopus alpha 1 subunits or coexpressed Torpedo alpha 1 subunits to yield a functional alpha 1/AMOG sodium pump isozyme. Determinations of the number of ouabain binding sites and ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake suggest that the alpha 1/AMOG isozyme has slightly lower maximum transport rate and apparent affinity for external K+ than the alpha 1/beta 1 isozyme. Immunoprecipitation of alpha 1/AMOG complexes from digitonin extracts of [35S]methionine-labeled oocytes with a monoclonal anti-AMOG antibody provides direct evidence for a stable association between AMOG and the alpha 1 subunits of Xenopus and Torpedo."
https://openalex.org/W1507376373,"DNA cloned from Chlamydia trachomatis is able to direct the formation of the genus-specific lipopolysaccharide epitope of chlamydiae in enteric Gram-negative bacteria. We now demonstrate that a single C. trachomatis gene (gseA) is sufficient to impart this trait to Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence of gseA shows 23% identity (66% similarity) to kdtA, an E. coli gene that codes for a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the addition of two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues to lipid A precursors (Clementz, T., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9687-9696). Extracts of E. coli expressing gseA transfer at least one additional Kdo unit from CMP-Kdo to precursors already bearing the two Kdo residues attached by the kdtA gene product. Introduction of gseA into an E. coli mutant with a thermolabile kdtA gene product endows cell extracts with the ability to transfer not only the third but also the first two Kdos to lipid A precursors, demonstrating that the C. trachomatis enzyme is at least trifunctional. Given the similarities of these two Kdo transferases and the essentiality of Kdo in Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis may be a target for development of novel drugs effective against chlamydiae."
https://openalex.org/W1604369171,"The L1 larvae of the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis invade skeletal muscle and initiate a process that has been interpreted to represent skeletal muscle dedifferentiation. In this process, the infected region of the muscle cell is converted into a unique structure, called the Nurse cell. The nematode T. spiralis can survive for tens of years within the cytoplasm of the Nurse cell and secretes proteins into the cytoplasm that are believed to play a role in mediating the Nurse cell formation or maintenance. We have cloned a cDNA encoding the T. spiralis-derived, 43-kDa secreted protein. Structural analysis of the predicted 344-amino acid sequence revealed an N terminally located signal peptide and a potential helix-loop-helix motif in the main body of the protein. Antibodies raised against the 43-kDa recombinant protein were used in immunocytolocalizations of T. spiralis-infected skeletal muscle sections. These antibodies strongly stained the Nurse cell nuclei and the nematode itself. Specific, though slightly weaker staining also occurred in the Nurse cell cytoplasm. In Western blots, the antibodies react with the 43-kDa protein but also detected at least two other T. spiralis-secreted proteins. DNA hybridizations reveal at least one additional 43-kDa-related sequence encoded in the T. spiralis genome. We conclude that either the 43-kDa protein and/or a closely related 43-kDa family member is secreted into the muscle and translocates to the muscle-derived nuclei. This model may provide insights into the mechanisms involved in Nurse cell formation."
https://openalex.org/W1515028535,"Our recently found nonlipoprotein inhibitor of chylomicron remnant uptake, lactoferrin, has been investigated in vivo and in vitro. Lipoprotein lipase extracted triglycerides from chylomicrons, doubly labeled with [3H]retinol/[14C]oleate, in the presence of lactoferrin normally. The subsequent uptake of remnants into liver was retarded considerably. In the intact rat, chylomicron remnants (CRs), predominantly labeled in the apoB48 moiety by 125I, were excluded from the hepatic endosomal compartment in the presence of lactoferrin as shown in subcellular fractionation studies of rat livers. In tissue culture, internalization of [125I]chylomicron remnants was inhibited in the presence of 14 pM lactoferrin by 70%. Upon removal of lactoferrin, internalization was rapidly restored. Protease digestion eliminated the inhibitory effect completely. Modification of arginine residues with cyclohexanedione reversibly removed the inhibitory potency of lactoferrin. We located by molecular modeling an alpha-helical segment in lactoferrin on the exposed surface of the molecule containing the sequence Arg-X-X-Arg-Lys-X-Arg, which resembles the receptor recognition structure in apolipoprotein E (apoE). This firmly established ligand correspondence with apoE, the candidate ligand for CR recognition by the receptor. Finally, the postulated second function of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, uptake of alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) was found to be distinct from lipoprotein binding, since lactoferrin inhibited CR but not alpha 2M internalization. In addition, CR uptake was not affected by alpha 2M. We conclude that if a bifunctional receptor were to operate, its diverse functions were exerted by independently operating substructures. The results of our in vivo and cell culture experiments are, however, entirely compatible with the existence of two receptors as well."
https://openalex.org/W1525330575,"Abstract We characterized the electrophysiological properties of a chloride channel protein isolated from bovine trachea after incorporation into planar lipid bilayers, and studied the effects of thiol-modulating agents on channel regulation both in bilayers and vesicular iodide uptake studies. Our experiments showed that this protein formed perfectly anion-selective channels in the bilayer, with an anion permeability sequence of I- (2.1) > NO3- (1.7) > Br- (1.2) > Cl- (1.0). The conductance of this channel was 25-30 picosiemens in 150 mM Cl-, and saturated with increasing chloride concentration. This channel could be completely inhibited by 4,4'-bis(isothiocyano)-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate. Immunoblot analysis, using polyclonal antibodies (anti-p38), revealed one major band at 140 kDa. Upon reduction with dithiothreitol, 64- and 38-kDa polypeptides were observed. Functional experiments showed that reduction was accompanied by loss of 125I- uptake and single-channel activity. In the presence of dithiothreitol, only the low molecular mass protein forms (64 and 38 kDa) were detected by anti-p38 antibodies on Western blots. Cross-linking of S-S bonds with Cu(2+)-o-phenanthroline led to activation of chloride channels in vesicles and bilayers. Over-aggregation of chloride channels by this S-S cross-linking reagent caused inhibition of 125I- uptake by 80-100% and the abolishment of single-channel activity. We propose that the native chloride channel from bovine trachea can exist in vivo in different structural and functional forms depending upon its thiol-disulfide oxidation reduction status. The oxidized form has a molecular mass of 140 kDa and represents a fully active chloride channel. Inactivation of this channel might occur by over-aggregation of protein subunits, or by dissociation of the 140-kDa subunit by disulfide bond reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1563665002,"Selectins are receptors that mediate leukocyte adhesion to platelets or endothelial cells through Ca(2+)-dependent interactions with cell surface oligosaccharides. We found that peptides corresponding to residues 23-30, 54-63, and 70-79 of the N-terminal lectin domain of P-selectin inhibited leukocyte adhesion to P-selectin. Peptides corresponding to the homologous 23-30 and 54-63 regions of E-selectin and L-selectin also prevented cell binding to P-selectin. Immobilized albumin conjugates of the three P-selectin peptides supported adhesion of myeloid cells and certain other cells expressing fucosylated oligosaccharides. Ca2+ was required for optimal cell adhesion to the conjugates containing the 23-30 and 54-63 sequences. Furthermore, Ca2+ interacted with the 23-30 and 54-63 peptides of all three selectins, as detected by changes in intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity. These data suggest that residues contained within the 23-30 and 54-63 regions of the selectins represent contact sites for carbohydrate structures on target cells. Furthermore, binding of Ca2+ to these sequences may directly enhance their ability to interact with cell surface ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1511102489,"Abstract Bupivacaine and etidocaine possess the remarkable property of stimulating mitochondrial respiration to levels comparable with those observed with classical anionic protonophores (Dabadie, P., Bendriss, P., Erny, P., and Mazat, J.P. (1987) FEBS Lett. 226, 77-82). We show that these amphiphilic amines conduct protons across the membranes of mitochondria and liposomes and stimulate respiration by a true protonophoretic mechanism. The kinetics of drug-induced H+ flux exhibited integer Hill coefficients that were greater than two under all conditions, suggesting that multimers are required for H+ transport. When the energy barrier for ion transport was lowered in mitochondria, by increasing the membrane potential, or in liposomes, by adding phloretin, the Hill coefficients decreased to lower integer numbers. Protonophoretic activity depended exclusively on medium concentration of free base, leading us to conclude that bupivacaine and etidocaine conduct protons as associated, intramembrane multimers of the free base. Bupivacaine-induced H+ leak was ohmic rather than nonohmic, as would be expected of a mobile charged carrier. This kinetic behavior seems improbable for a multimeric mobile carrier mechanism and suggests a mechanism, in which ohmicity results from splitting of the energy barrier by energy wells along the transport pathway (Garlid, K. D., Beavis, A. D., and Ratkje, S. K. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 976, 109-120). We hypothesize that bupivacaine and etidocaine act by a novel flickering channel mechanism, in which transient linear complexes of free base molecules provide weak binding sites (energy wells) for protons within lipid bilayer membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1532991950,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase, the enzyme which converts dopamine to norepinephrine, is expressed in a cell type-restricted pattern in neuroendocrine tissue. A segment of the rat gene containing 395 bases of 5'-flanking sequence regulates expression of a reporter gene in a cell type-selective pattern in mammalian cell cultures. Using deletion mutants of the 5'-flanking sequence, we have identified a 30-base genetic regulatory element, designated DB1, which enhances transcription from a heterologous promoter 5-20-fold in neuroendocrine cell lines. DB1-specific DNA-protein complexes are found in nuclear extracts from all cell lines examined, but the migration pattern differs between cell lines. The 5'-flanking region of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene is also responsive to cyclic AMP and phorbol ester treatment of SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells. The simultaneous presence of both effectors results in synergistic increases in DBH1 mRNA and reporter gene activity. The second messenger regulatory element was localized to the region containing the DB1 element, and reporter plasmids containing multiple copies of the DB1 element are responsive to treatment with inducers. The results of this study identify a cis-acting regulatory element which influences both cell type selectivity and second messenger responsiveness of the rat dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene."
https://openalex.org/W2122925309,"We report the first molecular characterization of a precursor sequence for a small, Ca2+ channel blocking, peptide spider toxin, omega-agatoxin IA. By integrating information generated from a molecular genetic approach using agatoxin cDNAs with data provided from mass spectrometry of the mature toxin, we were able to deduce the likely mechanisms by which the toxin precursor peptide is processed to its mature heterodimeric form. A particularly interesting feature of the prepropeptide is the occurrence of two glutamate-rich sequences interposed between the signal sequences, the major peptide toxin, and the minor toxin peptide. Excision of the more distal glutamate-rich region appears to be signaled by flanking arginine residues but likely occurs only after a disulfide linkage has formed between the major and minor chains of the mature toxin. Our molecular genetic approach toward characterizing this toxin will allow us to quickly generate a series of spider sequences from which mature toxin structures can be deduced and eventually expressed. Additionally, this approach will provide insights into the evolutionary divergence observed among spider peptide toxins."
https://openalex.org/W1486396879,"Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) is a membrane protein exclusively expressed on endothelial cells, where it plays a key role in the inflammatory response by adhering to a subset of leukocytes. The expression of the ELAM-1 gene is very tightly regulated. ELAM-1 is undetectable in uninduced cells, and it is transiently expressed following cytokine induction. Treatment of resting endothelial cells with three different protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide (CHX), anisomycin, and emetine, caused an increase in the steady-state level of ELAM-1 mRNA above that observed with IL (interleukin)-1 alone. Furthermore, ELAM-1 mRNA was found in the presence of all three protein synthesis inhibitors without IL-1 treatment. Analysis of the mRNA half-life indicated that the protein synthesis inhibitors act, in part, by stabilizing ELAM-1 mRNA. In addition, protein synthesis inhibitors potentiate the effect of IL-1 beta at the level of transcription initiation as shown by nuclear run-on experiments. The NF kappa B-like binding activity to the ELAM-1 promoter sequence induced by IL-1 beta is augmented by inhibitors of protein synthesis. The NF kappa B binding sequence was found to be necessary and sufficient for superinduction of the ELAM-1 gene by CHX. These results show that regulation at the level of protein synthesis is implicated in the overall regulation of ELAM-1 gene expression. Mechanisms which could explain these effects are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1500773339,"Relaxation of superhelical DNA by Escherichia coli topoisomerase III (Topo III) was inhibited by the inclusion of tRNA in the reaction mixture. Investigation of the basis of this inhibition revealed that Topo III could bind RNA and establish a cleavage-religation equilibrium. The addition of SDS to these reaction mixtures induced cleavage of the RNA by Topo III. The nucleotide sequences of RNA and DNA cleavage sites were identical, although cleavage site preference differed. Thus, the possibility that Topo III can pass strands of RNA as well as strands of DNA must be considered in accounting for the role of this enzyme in nucleic acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1534790099,"Several investigators have suggested that secondary structures in DNA may be involved with physiologic gene regulatory processes in higher organisms. This hypothesis has been difficult to prove, however, since naturally occurring mutations that alter secondary DNA structures have not yet been identified. In this report, we describe a secondary DNA structure upstream from the human gamma-globin genes; this structure is formed in a homopyrimidine-homopurine tract and is stabilized by acidic pH and negative supercoiling of plasmid DNA. Since this structure is asymmetrically cleaved by S1 nuclease, it probably contains a single-stranded region and an intramolecular triplex. The single-stranded region is actually accessible for Watson-Crick base pairing with exogenous oligomers, a characteristic that permitted us to directly map the secondary DNA structure without additional chemical modifications of the supercoiled DNA. Five different point mutations just downstream from the single-stranded region are associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin; four of these mutations dramatically reduce the stability of the secondary DNA structure, suggesting that these mutations alter formation of the intramolecular triplex by destabilizing critical Hoogsteen (triple-stranded) base pairs. These mutations may therefore represent a novel class of genetic defects that alter gene expression by changing the interaction of a critical regulatory molecule with a secondary DNA structure."
https://openalex.org/W1514545881,"The Ca(2+)-independent endocytic hyaluronan (HA) receptor in rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LECs) was identified using a novel cross-linking derivative of HA. The heterobifunctional, photoactivatable, reducible reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1,3'-dithiopropionate (SASD) was coupled to the terminal amino group of uniquely modified HA-amine oligosaccharides (M(r) approximately 60,000) and subsequently iodinated. 125I-ASD-HA bound to cultured LECs with similar specificity and affinity as a previously characterized 125I-HA-amine/Bolton-Hunter adduct. Permeabilized LECs were incubated with 125I-ASD-HA with 10 mM EGTA and photolysed with UV light. Detergent extracts were reduced to release the HA oligosaccharides and radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Two polypeptides were consistently and equally labeled at M(r) = 175,000 and 166,000. Photoaffinity labeling of these two proteins was virtually identical in cultured LECs or membranes and was competed greater than 90% with a 100-fold excess of HA. As with the previously characterized bona fide LEC HA receptor, cross-linking was also competed by chondroitin sulfate and heparin, but less efficiently by chondroitin and not with galacturonan. We conclude that the Ca(2+)-independent LEC HA receptor is composed of at least two polypeptides of M(r) approximately 175,000 and 166,000 and may exist as a heterodimer of M(r) approximately 340,000. We also conclude that the LEC HA receptor is distinct from the CD44 family of HA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1532278288,"In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, treatment of mouse lacrimal acinar cells with maximal concentrations of methacholine released Ca2+ from intracellular stores. No additional Ca2+ was mobilized by subsequent application of the intracellular Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, the stable inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ((1,4,5)IP3) analog, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate ((2,4,5)IP3) (by microinjection), or the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. However, following prolonged activation of cells by methacholine in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, Ca2+ accumulated into a pool which was released by ionomycin but not by thapsigargin. This latter accumulation was blocked by prior microinjection of ruthenium red, indicating that it represents mitochondrial uptake. In saponin-permeabilized lacrimal cells, two Ca(2+)-sequestering pools were detected: (i) a ruthenium red-sensitive, thapsigargin-insensitive pool, presumed to be the mitochondria; and (ii) a ruthenium red-insensitive, thapsigargin-sensitive pool. Only the thapsigargin-sensitive pool accumulated Ca2+ at concentrations similar to those in unstimulated cells. The thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pool was sensitive to (1,4,5)IP3; however, in contrast to findings in intact cells, only 44% of this pool was releasable by (1,4,5)IP3 or (2,4,5)IP3. These data indicate that, in intact lacrimal acinar cells, all exchangeable (ionomycin-sensitive) Ca2+ residues in a pool which responds homogeneously to agonists, (1,4,5)IP3, and thapsigargin. Prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i results in Ca2+ accumulation into a second, ruthenium red-sensitive pool, presumably mitochondria. Finally, permeabilization of the cells fragments the non-mitochondrial pool, resulting in two pools, one sensitive and one insensitive to (1,4,5)IP3."
https://openalex.org/W1564667692,"In the present study we used thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of microsomal calcium ATPase, to evaluate the roles of free cytoplasmic calcium and intracellular stored calcium in secretagogue-stimulated enzyme secretion from rat pancreatic acini. Using microspectrofluorimetry of fura-2-loaded pancreatic acini, we found that TG caused a sustained increase in free cytoplasmic calcium by mobilizing calcium from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular stores and by increasing influx of extracellular calcium. TG also caused a small increase in basal amylase secretion, inhibited the stimulation of amylase secretion caused by secretagogues that increase inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and potentiated the stimulation of amylase secretion caused by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or secretagogues that increase cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Bombesin, which like TG increased free cytoplasmic calcium, also potentiated the stimulation of amylase secretion caused by secretagogues that increase cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, but did not inhibit the stimulation of amylase secretion caused by secretagogues that increase inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Finally, TG inhibited the sustained phase of cholecystokinin-stimulated amylase secretion and potentiated the time course of vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated amylase secretion. The present findings indicate that stimulation of amylase secretion by secretagogues that increase inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate does not depend on increased free cytoplasmic calcium per se. In contrast, TG-induced potentiation of the stimulation of secretagogues that increase cellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate appears to result from increased free cytoplasmic calcium per se."
https://openalex.org/W1533989521,"Activation of Na+/H+ exchange activity is a ubiquitous response to growth factors and has been implicated in the mitogenic response. Little is known of how the antiport influences events in the nucleus which ultimately control the cell cycle. Using potent Na+/H+ exchange inhibitors we show for normal mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages that this activity is required for the colony-stimulating factor-1-induced gene expression of the M1 and M2 subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme critical for DNA synthesis. Suppression of M1 and M2 mRNA levels occurred when the inhibitors were added up to 8 h after the growth factor, mirroring their ability to prevent entry into S phase at similar times. Antiport activity was not required for the induction of other genes associated with cell cycle progression including proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the G1 cyclin, CYL1. These results highlight the differential expression of various cell cycle-associated genes and demonstrates that non-coordinate regulation of CYL1 cyclin and DNA synthesis gene expression can occur. The selective dependence of ribonucleotide reductase subunit gene expression on Na+/H+ exchange activity may provide a biochemical basis for the requirement of persistent antiporter activity during G1 for subsequent entry into S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1535890429,"The unicellular green alga Dunaliella bardawil responds to high light, nutrient deprivation, and several other types of stress by massive accumulation of beta-carotene. We have previously cloned a nuclear gene, cbr, that is co-induced with accelerated carotenogenesis. The predicted product of cbr is closely related to early light-induced proteins (Elips) of higher plants, and also shows resemblance to chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins. In the present study, the determination of the cbr transcription start site supported the previously proposed site of translation initiation. Antibodies raised against a synthetic oligopeptide matching the predicted sequence of Cbr recognized two polypeptides of apparently 17 and 19 kDa that were induced in parallel to cbr transcript accumulation in highly illuminated or sulfate-starved D. bardawil cells. The antibodies also cross-reacted with an approximately 20-kDa polypeptide in sulfate-starved Dunaliella salina. In both D. bardawil and D. salina, Cbr was found exclusively in the thylakoid membranes. After mild solubilization, Cbr co-fractionated with light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) in sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel electrophoresis and was specifically associated with a minor LHCII complex. An occasionally observed, faster mobility Cbr form, free of LHCII, was probably released from the larger complex. These results support the conclusion that Cbr belongs to a class of stress-induced proteins transiently associated with antennae complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2055297291,"At extreme membrane potentials, the unitary inward and outward currents through L-type Ca2+ channels become diffusion controlled and saturate. The magnitudes of these currents indicate that the pore entrances are asymmetric, with the external mouth being much larger than the internal one. On the other hand, negative surface potentials at the two ends of the pore are rather similar. Both would be significant only when the ambient ionic strength is 110 mM or less. We conclude that the surface charges will not help much in concentrating the channel's favorite divalent cations in the physiological condition. However, the pore does possess an external mouth large enough to make the important inward Ca2+ flow not limited by diffusion, even with only 1 mM external Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1539110229,"Abstract Protein kinase C (PKC) has been believed to play an important role in the differentiation/proliferation of various kinds of mammalian cells. To analyze its function in living animals, we have established a transgenic mouse line carrying rabbit protein kinase C alpha cDNA under the control of the regulatory element of human CD2. Thymocytes of these transgenic mice overexpressed PKC alpha. Interestingly, the increase of PKC alpha was detected mainly in membrane fractions of transgenic thymocytes. Although the transgenic thymocytes did not show any distinct proliferative features in vivo, they displayed a unique property to extensively proliferate and produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) in response to the stimulation by a soluble form of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), an incomplete agonist for proliferation of normal thymocytes. Furthermore, co-stimulation of the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and anti-CD3 mAb intensely provoked the transgenic thymocytes to release IL-2. For the first time this result provided the direct evidence that PKC alpha translocated to the cell membrane of thymocytes works as an active second messenger of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex-delivered signal for proliferation and IL-2 production."

https://openalex.org/W1503777058,"The precursor homodimeric p66/p66 form of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) possesses the DNA polymerase and RNase H activities involved in the synthesis of the double-stranded provirus DNA. Reverse transcription is initiated from tRNALys in the case of HIV-1. The present study confirmed that interactions between HIV-1 RT and tRNALys induce protein conformational changes and demonstrated that these interactions stimulate the enzymatic activities associated with the p66 subunit. Thus, the p66/p66 form of the enzyme is strongly stimulated in both DNA polymerase and RNase H activities. Preincubation of the enzyme with tRNA is an obligatory step to obtain the stimulatory effect. The affinity of template, primer, or substrate for RT p66/p66 did not change when the enzyme was preincubated with tRNALys at stimulatory concentrations; the interaction of tRNA with p66/p66 has an effect only on the maximal rate of polymerization. It is further shown that the RNase H domain of RT is much more accessible to protease attack than the DNA polymerase active site."
https://openalex.org/W1579587330,"Studies are presented further characterizing a facilitative system transporting methotrexate (MTX) polyglutamates into lysosomes derived from S180 cells. Initial influx of [3H]MTX + G1 (MTX with 1 additional glutamyl residue) exhibited a slightly alkaline pH optimum (pH 7.7) and was moderately temperature-dependent (Q10 27-37 degrees C = 3.1 +/- 0.1). An analysis of the kinetics of intralysosomal accumulation of [3H]MTX + G1 showed saturation kinetics for initial influx, but linear kinetics for the steady-state level of exchangeable [3H]MTX + G1 at different external concentrations of [3H]MTX + G1. In addition, the system exhibited substantial directional asymmetry with respect to the interaction with MTX + G1 during influx and efflux. Accelerated homo- and heteroexchange diffusion was demonstrated for influx of [3H]MTX + G1, while decelerated homoexchange diffusion was demonstrated for efflux of [3H]MTX + G1 following trans-positioning of MTX + G1 or glutamyl-gamma-glutamate in the opposite compartment. These observations were consistent with a single mobile carrier system mediating influx and efflux of this polyglutamate. Based upon an analysis of competitive interactions with [3H] MTX + G1, this system displayed specificity for MTX-gamma-glutamates, folyl-gamma-polyglutamates, alpha- or gamma-glutamyl peptides and heteropeptides bearing a C-terminal gamma-glutamate but not for MTX or glutamate, themselves. Among polyglutamates, gamma-glutamyl chain length was not a significant factor for transport except in the case of MTX polyglutamates. Overall, our results appear to delineate in the lysosomal membrane a simple mobile carrier system with broad specificity for folyl- or non-folyl-bearing peptides responsible for the transport of MTX polyglutamates."
https://openalex.org/W1483900451,"BC-1 RNA is a brain-specific small RNA transcript of identifier sequences present in the somas and dendrites of neurons. We recently reported that the RNA is complexed with a protein(s) to form a 10 S ribonucleoprotein particle (Kobayashi, S., Goto, S., and Anzai, K. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4726-4730). We demonstrate here that this 10 S BC-1 ribonucleoprotein particle contains a DNA-binding protein(s) (Bp-1 protein) capable of interacting with a region between split promoter sequences for RNA polymerase III within the identifier sequences. The region has short inverted repeats: a perfect octanucleotide repeat (GCGCTTGCCTAGCAAGCGC) and an imperfect heptanucleotide repeat (GCCTAGCAAGCGCAAGGC), each of which contains a GCAAG/CTTGC motif. We also demonstrate that the binding of this protein either to the array of pentamer motifs or to BC-1 RNA is mutually exclusive. The molecular masses of photo-cross-linking adducts of Bp-1 protein to a 32P-labeled GCAAG/CTTGC motif-specific probe were estimated to be about 31 and 36 kDa, indicating that two species of Bp-1 proteins may be present in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1565919704,"In a prior report we presented evidence that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) can act in an autocrine fashion by demonstrating that FRTL-5 cells transfected with hIGF-IA fusion genes express and secrete biologically active IGF-I that renders the stimulation of DNA synthesis in FRTL-5 cells independent of their requirement for exogenous IGFs or insulin. To determine if IGF-I's autocrine actions require secretion or can be mediated by interactions with intracellular receptors, we have created a new line of FRTL-5 cells that express a mutant IGF-IA precursor containing the endoplasmic reticulum retention amino acid sequence, Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), at its carboxyl terminus. The mutant IGF-IA/KDEL precursor expressed by stably transfected FRTL-5 cells was shown to be retained intracellularly and to have biological activity comparable with mature IGF-I, as judged by the activity of partially purified IGF-IA/KDEL in wild type FRTL-5 cells. Expression of IGF-IA/KDEL in FRTL-5 cells, however, neither augmented TSH-stimulated DNA synthesis nor stimulated IGF-binding protein-5 expression, as does IGF-IA expression in transfected FRTL-5 cells and the addition of exogenous IGF-I to wild type FRTL-5 cells. IGF-IA/KDEL expression, however, desensitized FRTL-5 cells to the actions of exogenous IGF-I despite having only minimal effects on cell surface type I receptor number, suggesting that intracellular IGF-I is capable of significant biological actions. The failure of IGF-IA/KDEL to replicate the actions of secreted IGF-I, taken together with the findings that a monoclonal antibody against IGF-I blocked IGF-I's actions in IGF-I-secreting transfected FRTL-5 cells, provides evidence that IGF-I secretion and interaction with cell surface type I IGF receptors is the dominant mechanism of IGF-I's autocrine actions."
https://openalex.org/W1544492955,"Rat L6E9 muscle cells commit to terminal differentiation by forming a large muscle syncitia complete with the expression of a large number of muscle-specific contractile protein genes. To determine whether these cells, which fail to synthesize MLC (myosin light chain) 1 and cardiac alpha-actin, exhibit a deficiency in the expression of muscle determination genes, we measured expression of MyoD1, myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF-4. Results show these cells do not synthesize MyoD1, yet express the other myogenic determination genes. Transient expression of exogenous MyoD1 in these cells is sufficient to activate endogenous MLC 1 and cardiac alpha-actin mRNA synthesis during muscle differentiation. Previously undetected myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms (beta-MHC and perinatal MHC) are also transcribed at low levels in L6E9 muscle cells, and in MyoD1-transfected L6E9 cells no change occurs in their expression. Furthermore, treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine activates expression of the endogenous MyoD1 gene in L6E9 cells and, subsequently, rescues deficiencies in their myogenic biochemical program. These results demonstrate that the endogenous MyoD1 gene in L6E9 cells is not defective and can be functionally activated. Also, the MyoD1 protein plays an essential role, which cannot be compensated by other known muscle determination proteins, in the induction of MLC 1 and cardiac alpha-actin expression."
https://openalex.org/W1580556707,"We have generated by site-directed mutagenesis plasmids that induce the synthesis of specific mutants of the reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These recombinant mutants of HIV-1 RT, designed on the basis of our previous studies of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs, were analyzed for structure-function relationship by assessing their RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase as well as the ribonuclease H activities. Three groups of mutants were studied. 1) We have investigated the importance of the only two sets of highly conserved double prolines found in the sequence of HIV-1 RT. The results indicate that the conversion of either one or both prolines (at positions 225 and 226) to threonines have no significant effect on all catalytic activities of the enzyme. The mutants in which prolines 419 and 420 were individually modified to threonines exhibit full activities, whereas the double proline 419/420 mutant lost most of its RNase H activity (although the DNA polymerase function was fully retained). 2) We have deleted phenylalanine 346 from HIV-1 RT, which is absent in wild type HIV-2 RT. This mutant of HIV-1 RT lost practically all catalytic activities. 3) A mutant of HIV-1 RT in which a cysteine residue substituted for alanine 446, was found to be slightly hyperactive for both DNA polymerase and RNase H activities."
https://openalex.org/W1608376558,"The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 95-111 binds the alpha subunit of (H+,K+)-ATPase and inhibits the K(+)-ATPase activity. To map the epitope, all of the partial sequences of the alpha subunit were expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 using rabbit alpha subunit cDNA restriction fragments ligated into PuEx vector. Bacterial recombinant lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and the epitope was detected by Western blotting. The antibody site was mapped between Cys529 and Glu561. This is close to the Lys517 that binds fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and is considered to be between M4 and M5 close to the ATP binding domain. However, the mAb inhibition of ATPase is not ATP-competitive but is K(+)-competitive with a KI of 2 x 10(-9) M. The mAb also inhibits K+ quench of FITC fluorescence competitively with a KI of 8 x 10(-9) M. The K+ activation of ATPase activity and quench of FITC fluorescence are dependent on K+ binding to an E2 form of the enzyme from the extracytoplasmic surface. The mAb epitope is cytoplasmic since the K(+)-ATPase activity of ion-tight gastric vesicles is inhibited. The 125I-mAb 95-111 binds to a single class of sites with an apparent KD of 2.3 +/- 0.8 x 10(-9) M and K+ does not displace bound mAb. Hence, antibody binding to a cytoplasmic Cys529-Glu561 epitope allosterically competes with K(+)-dependent reactions at extracytoplasmic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1602619312,"Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene expression was studied in HT29 cells. It is known that the abundance of CFTR mRNA increases during differentiation of pluripotent HT29-18 cells and is maintained at high levels in the stably differentiated HT29-18-C1 subclone. Nuclear run-on assays suggest that increased transcription of the CFTR gene explains the increased abundance of total CFTR mRNA in differentiated HT29 cells. The increased transcription cannot be ascribed to cell cycle-dependent expression of the CFTR gene or to changes in CFTR gene copy number between subcloned cells. Similar to native tissue cells, differentiated HT29 cells contain low copy numbers of CFTR transcripts (1-5/cell), and a portion of the CFTR transcripts are alternatively spliced to remove exon 9 (and make 9-mRNA). During differentiation of HT29-18 cells, the absolute amount of full-length CFTR mRNA increases 8-fold, whereas the amount of 9- mRNA increases 18-fold. The fraction of 9- mRNA in the CFTR mRNA pool is increased in differentiated HT29 cells. The results show that gene transcription regulates the abundance of CFTR transcripts and that regulatory control of alternative RNA splicing may also be a cellular mechanism to modulate CFTR function."
