Knowing the regional structure of ice variability during glaciations and deglaciations will clarify the mechanisms of the glacial cycle. Clark et al. (p. 710 ) compiled and analyzed more than 5000 radiocarbon and cosmogenic surface exposure ages in order to develop a record of maximum regional ice extent around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. The responses of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres differed significantly, which reveals how the evolution of specific ice sheets affected sea level and provides insight into how insolation controlled the deglaciation."

Crossing two inbred lines tends to result in “better” offspring, in a process known as heterosis. Attempts to map the genetic loci that control traits important for farming have been made, but few have been successful (see the Perspective by Mackay ). Buckler et al. (p. 714 ) and McMullen et al. (p. 737 ) produced a genomic map of maize that relates recombination to genome structure. Even tremendous adaptations in very diverse species were produced by numerous, small additive steps. Differences in flowering time in maize among inbred lines were not caused by a few genes with large effects, but by the cumulative effects of numerous quantitative trait loci—each of which has only a small impact on the trait."

(p. 725 ; see the Perspective by Liu and Yan ) designed DNA helix bundles, arranged in honeycomb lattices, in which some of the helices have insertions or deletions relative to the other helices in the bundles. The stresses help the bundles assemble into objects on the scale of tens of nanometers. Both the direction and degree of bending could be controlled, and curvatures as tight as 6 nanometers achieved. Complex shapes, such as square-toothed gears, could be created by combining multiple curved elements."

https://openalex.org/W2086084765,"Achieving coherent quantum control over massive mechanical resonators via coupling to electrons or photons is a current research goal. Here Gröblacher et al. report clear evidence for coupling of cavity photons to a mechanical resonator in the strong regime, which is essential for the preparation of mechanical quantum states and applications in quantum information processing. Achieving coherent quantum control over massive mechanical resonators via coupling to electrons or photons is a current research goal. Here, unambiguous evidence for strong coupling of cavity photons to a mechanical resonator is reported, paving the way for full quantum optical control of nano- and micromechanical devices. Achieving coherent quantum control over massive mechanical resonators is a current research goal. Nano- and micromechanical devices can be coupled to a variety of systems, for example to single electrons by electrostatic1,2 or magnetic coupling3,4, and to photons by radiation pressure5,6,7,8,9 or optical dipole forces10,11. So far, all such experiments have operated in a regime of weak coupling, in which reversible energy exchange between the mechanical device and its coupled partner is suppressed by fast decoherence of the individual systems to their local environments. Controlled quantum experiments are in principle not possible in such a regime, but instead require strong coupling. So far, this has been demonstrated only between microscopic quantum systems, such as atoms and photons (in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics12) or solid state qubits and photons13,14. Strong coupling is an essential requirement for the preparation of mechanical quantum states, such as squeezed or entangled states15,16,17,18, and also for using mechanical resonators in the context of quantum information processing, for example, as quantum transducers. Here we report the observation of optomechanical normal mode splitting19,20, which provides unambiguous evidence for strong coupling of cavity photons to a mechanical resonator. This paves the way towards full quantum optical control of nano- and micromechanical devices."
https://openalex.org/W2066887109,"No NO Isoprene, a five-carbon diene produced by plants, is the most abundant nonmethane hydrocarbon released into the atmosphere and plays an important role in tropospheric chemistry. Isoprene is also thought to affect climate by acting as a source of atmospheric aerosols. Paulot et al. (p. 730 ; see the Perspective by Kleindienst ) now describe how isoprene may lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. In laboratory experiments, the photooxidation of isoprene in low-NO conditions, such as those which occur in vegetated regions far from anthropogenic influence, produced high yields of dihydroxy epoxides, a suspected precursor of the aerosols. This discovery could help to explain some of the more puzzling aspects of isoprene chemistry in remote regions."

What microenvironmental conditions provide a selective growth advantage to these cells? Yun et al. (p. 1555 , published online 6 August) identify low glucose availability as a microenvironmental factor driving the acquisition of KRAS oncogenic mutations that allow cancer cells to survive and grow. In genetically matched colorectal cancer cells that differed only in the mutational status of the KRAS oncogene, mutant cells selectively overexpressed glucose transporter-1 and exhibited enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis. When cells with wild-type KRAS were placed in a low-glucose environment, very few cells survived but most of the survivors expressed high levels of glucose transporter-1, and a small percentage of the survivors had acquired new KRAS mutations. Thus, glucose deprivation may help to drive the acquisition of cell growth–promoting oncogenic mutations during tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2032136448,"Single-stranded RNA viruses encompass broad classes of infectious agents and cause the common cold, cancer, AIDS and other serious health threats. Viral replication is regulated at many levels, including the use of conserved genomic RNA structures. Most potential regulatory elements in viral RNA genomes are uncharacterized. Here we report the structure of an entire HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution using SHAPE, a high-throughput RNA analysis technology. The genome encodes protein structure at two levels. In addition to the correspondence between RNA and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of RNA structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in HIV proteins. This correlation suggests that RNA structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding. Some simple genome elements previously shown to be important, including the ribosomal gag-pol frameshift stem-loop, are components of larger RNA motifs. We also identify organizational principles for unstructured RNA regions, including splice site acceptors and hypervariable regions. These results emphasize that the HIV-1 genome and, potentially, many coding RNAs are punctuated by previously unrecognized regulatory motifs and that extensive RNA structure constitutes an important component of the genetic code. The secondary structure of a complete HIV-1 RNA genome has been determined, based on analysis of authentic HIV RNA extracted from infectious virions. Secondary structures within single-stranded viral RNA genomes are known to serve functional and regulatory roles, but until now there has been no comprehensive analysis of total RNA for any virus. SHAPE technology (high-throughput selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension) was used to characterize all structures formed by the HIV-1 RNA genome. Numerous highly structured motifs were discovered, and functions can be inferred for many of these motifs. Importantly, the presence of RNA structural elements was found to influence the translation of proteins and to facilitate proper protein folding. These results emphasize that the HIV-1 genome does have a structure, elements of which are critical to viral fitness. Insights from this work could lead to a better understanding of HIV-1 biology and to new antiretroviral interventions. Single-stranded RNA viruses are responsible for the common cold, cancer, AIDS and other serious health threats. The genomes of these viruses form conserved secondary structures that have functional and regulatory roles, but most potential regulatory elements in viral RNA genomes remain uncharacterized. Here however, the structure of an entire HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution is reported."
https://openalex.org/W2140885691,"Fine Dendrites Fire Differently The pyramidal neuron is the basic computational unit in the brain cortex. Its distal tuft dendrite is heavily innervated by horizontal fibers coursing through cortical layer-I providing long-range corticocortical and thalamocortical associational input. Larkum et al. (p. 756 ) investigated whether the apical tuft dendrites of layer-5 neocortical pyramidal neurons, like basal dendrites, generate n -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) spikes using two-photon–guided direct dendritic recording, glutamate uncaging, and modeling. NMDA spikes could be evoked in the distal tuft dendrites, while Ca 2+ spikes could be triggered at the bifurcation points. Block of the hyperpolarization-activated current enhanced these NMDA spikes. Thus, the generation of NMDA spikes is a general principle of thin, basal, and tuft dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2098799628,"A Separate System for Itch Processing It has been a long-standing question if itch is a subquality of pain involving the same neuronal elements or if distinct, so-called labeled lines exist in the nervous system for both sensations. To address this question directly, Sun et al. (p. 1531 , published online 6 August) destroyed neurons in the superficial spinal dorsal horn that express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. This receptor is known to be involved in mediating itch but not pain sensations. In various animal models, ablation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-expressing spinal dorsal horn neurons reduced itch without changing pain perception. Thus, itch and pain indeed appear to be mediated by distinct labeled lines in the central nervous system."

The mechanisms by which cells regulate chromatin remodeling are not completely understood. During the response elicited by DNA damage, the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) to chromatin is associated with chromatin decondensation, which is thought to promote efficient DNA repair. Ahel et al. (p. 1240 , published online 30 July 2009) have identified a chromatin remodeling enzyme as a DNA damage-response protein, which binds poly(ADP-ribose)."

Fibrin can also be a scaffold for thrombi that lead to cardiovascular diseases. To maintain homeostasis, fibrin clots must be stiff, plastic, and, so that the network can be decompsed, permeable. Brown et al. (p. 741 ) investigated the behavior of fibrin clots at the macroscopic, single-fiber, and molecular scale. At relatively low strains, fibers aligned and formed bundles, and at higher strains, protein unfolding occurred. An integrated model provides a molecular basis for fibrin elasticity and extensibility."
https://openalex.org/W1978809795,Untangling Food Webs The factors affecting the stability of food webs are important in conservation and ecological restoration. Gross et al. (p. 747 ) used a generalized modeling approach to evaluate billions of replicates of food webs in order to reveal the properties that stabilize (or destabilize) food webs. Variability in the strength of trophic links between predator and prey strength affected stability in different ways depending on the size of the web—stabilizing only in relatively small food webs and destabilizing in larger ones. Universal topological rules were extracted for the patterns of network links that enhance food-web stability.
https://openalex.org/W2039272200,"Pathogens can use DNA recombination to promote antigenic variation (Av) of surface structures to avoid immune detection. We identified a cis-acting DNA sequence near the antigenically variable pilin locus of the human pathogen, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This 16-base pair guanine (G)-rich sequence was required for pilin Av and formed a guanine quartet (G4) structure in vitro. Individual mutations that disrupted the structure also blocked pilin Av and prevented nicks required for recombination from occurring within the G4 region. A compound that binds and stabilizes G4 structures also inhibited pilin Av and prevented nicks from occurring on the G-rich strand. This site constitutes a recombination initiation sequence/structure that directs gene conversion to a specific chromosomal locus."

https://openalex.org/W2135010009,"Higher-Level Quantum Emulation At the heart of a quantum computer is the device on which information is to be encoded. This is typically done with a qubit, a two-level quantum system analogous to the two-level bit that encodes 0 and 1 in classical computers. However, there need not be just two quantum energy levels. There could be three (a qutrit), or more generally, d -levels (a qudit) in the device. Neeley et al. (p. 722 ; see the Perspective by Nori ) demonstrate a five-level quantum device and show that their qudit can be used to emulate the processes involved in manipulating quantum spin. The use of multilevel qudits may also have potential in quantum information processing by simplifying certain computational tasks and simplifying the circuitry required to realize the quantum computer itself."
https://openalex.org/W2128897578,"Hi Fi Quantum Computing In quantum information processing, one goal is to control the entangled states of objects such that they can interact during logical operations but otherwise have minimal interactions with their environment. In one scheme for quantum computing, ions are trapped within and physically moved by electric fields. One drawback is that the entangled states can be sensitive to stray magnetic fields. Home et al. (p. 1227 , published online 6 August 2009) show that coupling of the ions (in this case, 9 Be + ) with a second ion ( 24 Mg + ) can create states that are relatively insensitive to magnetic fields and also allows for recooling of the ions during operation. This approach can minimize the loss of fidelity that occurs during ion transport."
https://openalex.org/W2149732267,"The catalytic engine of RNA interference (RNAi) is the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), wherein the endoribonuclease Argonaute and single-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) direct target mRNA cleavage. We reconstituted long double-stranded RNA- and duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activities with the use of recombinant Drosophila Dicer-2, R2D2, and Ago2 proteins. We used this core reconstitution system to purify an RNAi regulator that we term C3PO (component 3 promoter of RISC), a complex of Translin and Trax. C3PO is a Mg2+-dependent endoribonuclease that promotes RISC activation by removing siRNA passenger strand cleavage products. These studies establish an in vitro RNAi reconstitution system and identify C3PO as a key activator of the core RNAi machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2153545924,"Ten days of photometric data were obtained during the commissioning phase of the Kepler mission, including data for the previously known giant transiting exoplanet HAT-P-7b. The data for HAT-P-7b show a smooth rise and fall of light from the planet as it orbits its star, punctuated by a drop of 130 +/- 11 parts per million in flux when the planet passes behind its star. We interpret this as the phase variation of the dayside thermal emission plus reflected light from the planet as it orbits its star and is occulted. The depth of the occultation is similar in photometric precision to the detection of a transiting Earth-size planet for which the mission was designed."

https://openalex.org/W1520641405,"Recent studies have found that the oldest and most luminous galaxies in the early Universe are surprisingly compact, having stellar masses similar to present-day elliptical galaxies but much smaller sizes. This finding has attracted considerable attention as it suggests that massive galaxies have grown by a factor of ~five in size over the past ten billion years. A key test of these results is a determination of the stellar kinematics of one of the compact galaxies: if the sizes of these objects are as extreme as has been claimed, their stars are expected to have much higher velocities than those in present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we report a measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of a massive compact galaxy at redshift z=2.186, corresponding to a look-back time of 10.7 billion years. The velocity dispersion is very high at 510 (+165, -95) km/s, consistent with the mass and compactness of the galaxy inferred from photometric data and indicating significant recent structural and dynamical evolution of massive galaxies. The uncertainty in the dispersion was determined from simulations which include the effects of noise and template mismatch. However, we caution that some subtle systematic effect may influence the analysis given the low signal-to-noise ratio of our spectrum."

In the spinal cord they are believed to suppress nociception, the perception of pain and noxious stimuli. Pernia-Andrade et al. (p. 760 ) now find that endocannabinoids, which are released in spinal cord by noxious stimulation, may promote rather than inhibit nociception by acting on CB1 receptors. Endocannabinoids not only depress transmission at excitatory synapses in the spinal cord, but also block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, thereby facilitating nociception."

https://openalex.org/W2025694175,"Mapping Out an Entropic Landscape Quantum critical points are continuous phase transitions occurring near absolute zero displaying interesting properties that may have valuable applications. Experimental thermodynamic information on quantum critical systems is sparse, partly because the better known systems are tuned using hydrostatic pressure, and thermodynamic measurements are difficult to perform under such conditions. Rost et al. (p. 1360 , published online 6 August 2009; see the Perspective by Fisk ) built and calibrated bespoke apparatus for a thermodynamic study of strontium ruthenate using a magnetic field as the tuning parameter. The specific heat and magnetocaloric measuremements were combined to map an “entropy landscape” of the quantum criticality and phase formation. This technique should offer a way to probe other materials to reveal unusual properties, such as novel metallic states and superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2116568006,"Jamming Protein Translocation Antibiotics are tremendously important drugs in modern medicine, yet we are still learning precisely how they work. SecY is a bacterial membrane protein that is part of a complex that allows protein secretion across the membrane. Van Stelten et al. (p. 753 ; see the Perspective by Breukink ) found in Escherichia coli cells that if the protein translocator complex becomes jammed with a protein that cannot pass through, the SecY protein is degraded by the protease FtsH, leading to cell death. Cells could be protected by increasing amounts of an inhibitor of FtsH, the YccA protein. Antibiotics that block protein translation also caused jamming of the SecY machinery and destruction of SecY, thus contributing to cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2016122657,"Since their discovery in 1912, cosmic rays have puzzled theorists trying to explain their origin. Cosmic rays are in fact streams of subatomic particles and ions accelerated to close to the speed of light by distant and extremely energetic events. Extragalactic cosmic rays may well be generated by distant active galaxies hosting supermassive black holes. In a Progress review (available in our International Year of Astronomy reviews package on http://tinyurl.com/prhcqy ), Yousaf Butt takes aim at the current orthodoxy concerning 'Galactic' cosmic rays. It is widely accepted that these streams of particles, less energetic than the extragalactic sort, are accelerated in the shock waves associated with powerful supernova in our Galaxy. Butt thinks that the case for a supernova-remnant origin has not been made, and that even the notion that individual cosmic-ray acceleration sites exist could be flawed. The entire Galaxy, and structures called 'super-bubbles', could be involved. The origin of Galactic cosmic-ray ions has remained an enigma for almost a century. Although it has generally been thought that they are accelerated in the shock waves associated with powerful supernova explosions—for which there have been recent claims of evidence—the mystery is far from resolved. In fact, we may be on the wrong track altogether in looking for isolated regions of cosmic-ray acceleration."
https://openalex.org/W2111228714,"Protein synthesis involves the accurate attachment of amino acids to their matching transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Mistranslating the amino acids serine or glycine for alanine is prevented by the function of independent but collaborative aminoacylation and editing domains of alanyl-tRNA synthetases (AlaRSs). We show that the C-Ala domain plays a key role in AlaRS function. The C-Ala domain is universally tethered to the editing domain both in AlaRS and in many homologous free-standing editing proteins. Crystal structure and functional analyses showed that C-Ala forms an ancient single-stranded nucleic acid binding motif that promotes cooperative binding of both aminoacylation and editing domains to tRNA(Ala). In addition, C-Ala may have played an essential role in the evolution of AlaRSs by coupling aminoacylation to editing to prevent mistranslation."
https://openalex.org/W2166911293,"Mutations in either ClC-7, a late endosomal/lysosomal member of the CLC family of chloride channels and transporters, or in its beta-subunit Ostm1 cause osteopetrosis and lysosomal storage disease in mice and humans. The severe phenotype of mice globally deleted for ClC-7 or Ostm1 and the absence of storage material in cultured cells hampered investigations of the mechanism leading to lysosomal pathology in the absence of functional ClC-7/Ostm1 transporters. Tissue-specific ClC-7-knockout mice now reveal that accumulation of storage material occurs cell-autonomously in neurons or renal proximal tubular cells lacking ClC-7. Almost all ClC-7-deficient neurons die. The activation of glia is restricted to brain regions where ClC-7 has been inactivated. The effect of ClC-7 disruption on lysosomal function was investigated in renal proximal tubular cells, which display high endocytotic activity. Pulse-chase endocytosis experiments in vivo with mice carrying chimeric deletion of ClC-7 in proximal tubules allowed a direct comparison of the handling of endocytosed protein between cells expressing or lacking ClC-7. Whereas protein was endocytosed similarly in cells of either genotype, its half-life increased significantly in ClC-7-deficient cells. These experiments demonstrate that lysosomal pathology is a cell-autonomous consequence of ClC-7 disruption and that ClC-7 is important for lysosomal protein degradation."
