https://openalex.org/W3163681195,"Abstract Most known pathogenic point mutations in humans are C•G to T•A substitutions, which can be directly repaired by adenine base editors (ABEs). In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of ABEs in the livers of mice and cynomolgus macaques for the reduction of blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. Lipid nanoparticle–based delivery of mRNA encoding an ABE and a single-guide RNA targeting PCSK9 , a negative regulator of LDL, induced up to 67% editing (on average, 61%) in mice and up to 34% editing (on average, 26%) in macaques. Plasma PCSK9 and LDL levels were stably reduced by 95% and 58% in mice and by 32% and 14% in macaques, respectively. ABE mRNA was cleared rapidly, and no off-target mutations in genomic DNA were found. Re-dosing in macaques did not increase editing, possibly owing to the detected humoral immune response to ABE upon treatment. These findings support further investigation of ABEs to treat patients with monogenic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3160147040,"Ubiquitylation is a widespread post-translational protein modification in eukaryotes and marks bacteria that invade the cytosol as cargo for antibacterial autophagy1-3. The identity of the ubiquitylated substrate on bacteria is unknown. Here we show that the ubiquitin coat on Salmonella that invade the cytosol is formed through the ubiquitylation of a non-proteinaceous substrate, the lipid A moiety of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by the E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 213 (RNF213). RNF213 is a risk factor for moyamoya disease4,5, which is a progressive stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery that causes stroke (especially in children)6,7. RNF213 restricts the proliferation of cytosolic Salmonella and is essential for the generation of the bacterial ubiquitin coat, both directly (through the ubiquitylation of LPS) and indirectly (through the recruitment of LUBAC, which is a downstream E3 ligase that adds M1-linked ubiquitin chains onto pre-existing ubiquitin coats8). In cells that lack RNF213, bacteria do not attract ubiquitin-dependent autophagy receptors or induce antibacterial autophagy. The ubiquitylation of LPS on Salmonella that invade the cytosol requires the dynein-like core of RNF213, but not its RING domain. Instead, ubiquitylation of LPS relies on an RZ finger in the E3 shell. We conclude that ubiquitylation extends beyond protein substrates and that ubiquitylation of LPS triggers cell-autonomous immunity, and we postulate that non-proteinaceous substances other than LPS may also become ubiquitylated."

https://openalex.org/W3163019925,"Inflammation is a defence response to tissue damage that requires tight regulation in order to prevent impaired healing. Tissue-resident macrophages have a key role in tissue repair1, but the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance between inflammatory and pro-repair macrophage responses during healing remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a major role for sensory neurons in promoting the tissue-repair function of macrophages. In a sunburn-like model of skin damage in mice, the conditional ablation of sensory neurons expressing the Gαi-interacting protein (GINIP) results in defective tissue regeneration and in dermal fibrosis. Elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed a crucial role for the neuropeptide TAFA4, which is produced in the skin by C-low threshold mechanoreceptors-a subset of GINIP+ neurons. TAFA4 modulates the inflammatory profile of macrophages directly in vitro. In vivo studies in Tafa4-deficient mice revealed that TAFA4 promotes the production of IL-10 by dermal macrophages after UV-induced skin damage. This TAFA4-IL-10 axis also ensures the survival and maintenance of IL-10+TIM4+ dermal macrophages, reducing skin inflammation and promoting tissue regeneration. These results reveal a neuroimmune regulatory pathway driven by the neuropeptide TAFA4 that promotes the anti-inflammatory functions of macrophages and prevents fibrosis after tissue damage, and could lead to new therapeutic perspectives for inflammatory diseases."

However, because tongue movements are fast and difficult to resolve, neural control of lingual kinematics remains poorly understood. Here we combine kilohertz-frame-rate imaging and a deep-learning-based neural network to resolve 3D tongue kinematics in mice drinking from a water spout. Successful licks required corrective submovements that-similar to online corrections during primate reaches4-11-occurred after the tongue missed unseen, distant or displaced targets. Photoinhibition of anterolateral motor cortex impaired corrections, which resulted in hypometric licks that missed the spout. Neural activity in anterolateral motor cortex reflected upcoming, ongoing and past corrective submovements, as well as errors in predicted spout contact. Although less than a tenth of a second in duration, a single mouse lick exhibits the hallmarks of online motor control associated with a primate reach, including cortex-dependent corrections after misses."
https://openalex.org/W3160457054,"The human genome expresses thousands of natural antisense transcripts (NAT) that can regulate epigenetic state, transcription, RNA stability or translation of their overlapping genes1,2. Here we describe MAPT-AS1, a brain-enriched NAT that is conserved in primates and contains an embedded mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIR), which represses tau translation by competing for ribosomal RNA pairing with the MAPT mRNA internal ribosome entry site3. MAPT encodes tau, a neuronal intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that stabilizes axonal microtubules. Hyperphosphorylated, aggregation-prone tau forms the hallmark inclusions of tauopathies4. Mutations in MAPT cause familial frontotemporal dementia, and common variations forming the MAPT H1 haplotype are a significant risk factor in many tauopathies5 and Parkinson's disease. Notably, expression of MAPT-AS1 or minimal essential sequences from MAPT-AS1 (including MIR) reduces-whereas silencing MAPT-AS1 expression increases-neuronal tau levels, and correlate with tau pathology in human brain. Moreover, we identified many additional NATs with embedded MIRs (MIR-NATs), which are overrepresented at coding genes linked to neurodegeneration and/or encoding IDPs, and confirmed MIR-NAT-mediated translational control of one such gene, PLCG1. These results demonstrate a key role for MAPT-AS1 in tauopathies and reveal a potentially broad contribution of MIR-NATs to the tightly controlled translation of IDPs6, with particular relevance for proteostasis in neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3163669352,"β-lactam resistance represents a worldwide problem and a serious challenge for antimicrobial treatment. Hence this research was conducted to recognize several mechanisms mediating β-lactam resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae clinical isolates collected from Mansoura University hospitals, Egypt. A total of 80 isolates, 45 E. coli and 35 K. pneumoniae isolates, were collected and their antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the Disc diffusion method followed by phenotypic and genotypic detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC β-lactamase, carbapenemase enzymes. The outer membrane protein porins of all isolates were analyzed and their genes were examined using gene amplification and sequencing. Also, the resistance to complement-mediated serum killing was estimated. A significant percentage of isolates (93.8%) were multidrug resistance and showed an elevated resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. The presence of either ESBL or AmpC enzymes was high among isolates (83.75%). Also, 60% of the isolated strains were carbapenemase producers. The most frequently detected gene of ESBL among all tested isolates was blaCTX-M-15 (86.3%) followed by blaTEM-1 (81.3%) and blaSHV-1 (35%) while the Amp-C gene was present in 83.75%. For carbapenemase-producing isolates, blaNDM1 was the most common (60%) followed by blaVIM-1 (35%) and blaOXA-48 (13.8%). Besides, 73.3% and 40% of E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates respectively were serum resistant. Outer membrane protein analysis showed that 93.3% of E. coli and 95.7% of K. pneumoniae isolates lost their porins or showed modified porins. Furthermore, sequence analysis of tested porin genes in some isolates revealed the presence of frameshift mutations that produced truncated proteins of smaller size. β-lactam resistance in K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates in our hospitals is due to a combination of β-lactamase activity and porin loss/alteration. Hence more restrictions should be applied on β-lactams usage to decrease the emergence of resistant strains."
https://openalex.org/W3162802065,"Hydroxyapatite (HAp)-[Ca10 (PO4)6(OH) 2] has a similar chemical composition to bone material, making it the main mineral supplement in bone-making. Due to its high biocompatibility, hydroxyapatite is widely used in the repair of bone deficiencies and in the production of dental or orthopedic implants. In this research, hydroxyapatite nanopowder was synthesized using a hydrothermal technique. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the chemical structure and morphology of the synthesized hydroxyapatite powder. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to evaluate the phase analysis of HAp nanopowder. In addition, bioactivity HAp assessment was conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) attached with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD) was used in order to determine the optimal conditions for yield, size, and crystallinity. Three independent variables (pH, temperature, and hydrothermal treatment time) were investigated. The yield was observed to increase in alkaline conditions; pH showed the greatest influence on the yield, size, and crystallinity of the synthesized hydroxyapatite, based on Analysis of Variance. The results of bioactivity evaluation are showed high bioactivity due to the formation of apatite on the surface of the synthesized nanopowder."
https://openalex.org/W3161454284,"Membrane Type 1 Matrix Metalloprotease (MT1-MMP) contributes to the invasive progression of breast cancers by degrading extracellular matrix tissues. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase, NME1/NM23-H1, has been identified as a metastasis suppressor; however, its contribution to local invasion in breast cancer is not known. Here, we report that NME1 is up-regulated in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as compared to normal breast epithelial tissues. NME1 levels drop in microinvasive and invasive components of breast tumor cells relative to synchronous DCIS foci. We find a strong anti-correlation between NME1 and plasma membrane MT1-MMP levels in the invasive components of breast tumors, particularly in aggressive histological grade III and triple-negative breast cancers. Knockout of NME1 accelerates the invasive transition of breast tumors in the intraductal xenograft model. At the mechanistic level, we find that MT1-MMP, NME1 and dynamin-2, a GTPase known to require GTP production by NME1 for its membrane fission activity in the endocytic pathway, interact in clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane. Loss of NME1 function increases MT1-MMP surface levels by inhibiting endocytic clearance. As a consequence, the ECM degradation and invasive potentials of breast cancer cells are enhanced. This study identifies the down-modulation of NME1 as a potent driver of the in situ-to invasive transition during breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W3161169083,"The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be the most important phenomenon observed from March 2020 in virtually all countries of the world. The necessity to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep health care systems efficient resulted in the forced, drastic limitation of economic activity. Many service sectors were hit particularly hard with this but industry and agriculture were also affected. In particular, the pandemic substantially influenced financial markets and we can observe that some markets or instruments vary in stability since they have been affected in the different degree. In the paper, we present the problem of stability of stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the low number of works related to CEE countries during the pandemic, we analyze the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which is one of the most important markets in the CEE. Our main goal was to find how various industries represented by stock market indices have reacted to the COVID-19 shock and consequently which sectors turned out to keep stability and remained resistant to the pandemic. In our investigation, we use two clustering methods: the K -means and the Ward techniques with the criterion of maximizing the silhouette coefficient and six indicators describing stability in terms of profitability, volume, overbought/oversold conditions and volatility. The results of the research present that during the pandemic it was possible to identify 5 clusters of sector indices in the short term and 4 in the medium term. We found that the composition of the clusters is quite stable over time and that none of the obtained clusters can be univocally considered the most or the least stable taking into account all the analyzed indicators. However, we showed that the obtained clusters have different stability origins, i.e. they vary from each other in terms of the investigated indicators of stability."
https://openalex.org/W3162972923,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to closure of nearly all K-12 schools in the United States of America in March 2020. Although reopening K-12 schools for in-person schooling is desirable for many reasons, officials understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases are imperative in creating a safe return to school. Furthermore, consequences of reclosing recently opened schools are substantial and impact teachers, parents, and ultimately educational experiences in children. To address competing interests in meeting educational needs with public safety, we compare the impact of physical separation through school cohorts on SARS-CoV-2 infections against policies acting at the level of individual contacts within classrooms. Using an age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, we explore influences of reduced class density, transmission mitigation, and viral detection on cumulative prevalence. We consider several scenarios over a 6-month period including (1) multiple rotating cohorts in which students cycle through in-person instruction on a weekly basis, (2) parallel cohorts with in-person and remote learning tracks, (3) the impact of a hypothetical testing program with ideal and imperfect detection, and (4) varying levels of aggregate transmission reduction. Our mathematical model predicts that reducing the number of contacts through cohorts produces a larger effect than diminishing transmission rates per contact. Specifically, the latter approach requires dramatic reduction in transmission rates in order to achieve a comparable effect in minimizing infections over time. Further, our model indicates that surveillance programs using less sensitive tests may be adequate in monitoring infections within a school community by both keeping infections low and allowing for a longer period of instruction. Lastly, we underscore the importance of factoring infection prevalence in deciding when a local outbreak of infection is serious enough to require reverting to remote learning."
https://openalex.org/W3160573528,"Understanding the drivers for care-seeking among those who present with symptoms of TB is crucial for early diagnosis of TB and prompt treatment, which will in turn halt further TB transmission. While TB is a challenge among the tribal population, little is known about the care-seeking behaviour and the factors influencing care-seeking behaviour among the tribal population across India.This community-based descriptive study was carried out in 17 states of India across 6 zones, covering 88 villages from tribal districts with over 70% tribal population. The sample population included individuals ≥15 years old who were screened through an interview for symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB (PTB), currently and/or previously on anti-TB treatment. Those with symptoms were then assessed on their health-seeking behavior using a semi-structured interview schedule.Among 74532 eligible participants screened for symptoms suggestive of TB, 2675 (3.6%) were found to be presumptive TB cases. Of them, 659 (24.6%) sought care for their symptoms. While 48.2% sought care after a week, 19.3% sought care after one month or more, with no significant difference in the first point of care; 46.9% approaching a private and 46.7% a public facility. The significant factors influencing care-seeking behaviour were knowledge on TB (OR: 4.64 (3.70-5.83), p < 0.001), age<35 years (OR: 1.60 (1.28-2.00), p < 0.001), co-morbidities like asthma (OR: 1.80 (1.38-2.35), p < 0.001) and blood pressure (OR: 2.59 (1.75-3.85), p < 0.001), symptoms such as blood in sputum (OR: 1.69 (1.32-2.16), p < 0.001), shortness of breath (OR: 1.43 (1.19-1.72), p < 0.001) and weight loss (OR: 1.59 (1.33-1.89), p < 0.001). The cough was the most often reported symptom overall. There were gender differences in symptoms that prompted care-seeking: Males were more likely to seek care for weight loss (OR: 1.78 (1.42-2.23), p<0.001), blood in the sputum (OR: 1.69 (1.25-2.28), p<0.001), shortness of breath (OR: 1.49 (1.18-1.88), p<0.001) and fever (OR: 1.32 (1.05-1.65), p = 0.018). Females were more likely to seek care for blood in sputum (OR: 1.68 (1.10-2.58), p = 0.018) and shortness of breath (OR = 1.35, (1.01-1.82), p = 0.048). The cough did not feature as a significant symptom that prompted care-seeking.Delayed healthcare-seeking behaviour among those with symptoms presumptive of TB in the tribal population is a major concern. Findings point to differences across gender about symptoms that prompt care-seeking in this population. Gender-sensitive interventions with health system strengthening are urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment among this population."
https://openalex.org/W3160136018,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disease and exhibits diverse clinical presentations and disease progression. Some pathological and anatomical subtypes have been proposed. However, these subtypes provide a limited mechanistic understanding for AD. Leveraging gene expression data of 222 AD patients from The Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) Study, we identified two AD molecular subtypes (synaptic type and inflammatory type) using consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Synaptic type is characterized by disrupted synaptic vesicle priming and recycling and synaptic plasticity. Inflammatory type is characterized by disrupted IL2, interferon alpha and gamma pathways. The two AD molecular subtypes were validated using independent data from Gene Expression Omnibus. We further demonstrated that the two molecular subtypes are associated with APOE genotypes, with synaptic type more prevalent in AD patients with E3E4 genotype and inflammatory type more prevalent in AD patients with E3E3 genotype (p = 0.031). In addition, two molecular subtypes are differentially represented in male and female AD, with synaptic type more prevalent in male and inflammatory type in female patients (p = 0.051). Identification of AD molecular subtypes has potential in facilitating disease mechanism understanding, clinical trial design, drug discovery, and precision medicine for AD."
https://openalex.org/W3162472313,"Introduction With France one of the European countries most strongly affected by COVID-19 in the spring of 2020, French authorities imposed a nationwide lockdown for 8 weeks (March 17–May 10). This study explored the perception of the adult population about the need for—and access to—psychological support from health care professionals (HCP) in response to concerns about the psychological needs during lockdown. Material and method This online cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the adult general population of mainland France (N = 2,003) took place during the last four days of the French lockdown (May 7–10, 2020). Results One in eight respondents (12.2%) perceived a need for psychological support from an HCP during the lockdown; most had symptoms of depression and/or anxiety of at least moderate intensity. Only a third (29.8%, 3.6% of the entire sample) actually obtained this support. Factors associated with this perceived need included: age under 35, economic difficulties due to lockdown, pre-lockdown use of psychological support, infection with COVID-19, serious worries about becoming infected, and heavy media use to obtain information about the disease. Among those who perceived a need for psychological support, the elderly were the most likely not to consult an HCP. People aged 35–64, those with high income, and those seriously worried about developing COVID-19 were the most likely to forgo seeking access to care because of their fear of infection by the coronavirus-2019. Conclusion The perceived need for psychological support from an HCP and access to it appeared to be strongly associated with COVID-19 exposure factor. More research about this association is needed to improve the health authorities’ understanding of the population’s psychological needs in this situation and to enhance HCPs’ abilities to meet them. In particular, further research of its specific impact on youth is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3162641599,"The global spread of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor has promoted the spread and virulence of highly infectious honey bee viruses. This phenomenon is considered the leading cause for the increased number of colony losses experienced by the mite-susceptible European honey bee populations in the Northern hemisphere. Most of the honey bee populations in Central and South America are Africanized honey bees (AHBs), which are considered more resistant to Varroa compared to European honey bees. However, the relationship between Varroa levels and the spread of honey bee viruses in AHBs remains unknown. In this study, we determined Varroa prevalence and infestation levels as well as the prevalence of seven major honey bee viruses in AHBs from three regions of Colombia. We found that although Varroa exhibited high prevalence (92%), its infestation levels were low (4.5%) considering that these populations never received acaricide treatments. We also detected four viruses in the three regions analyzed, but all colonies were asymptomatic, and virus prevalence was considerably lower than those found in other countries with higher rates of mite-associated colony loss (DWV 19.88%, BQCV 17.39%, SBV 23.4%, ABPV 10.56%). Our findings indicate that AHBs possess a natural resistance to Varroa that does not prevent the spread of this parasite among their population, but restrains mite population growth and suppresses the prevalence and pathogenicity of mite-associated viruses."

Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) may serve as a programmatic tool to facilitate tourism. This pilot study examined the effects of VR tourism exposure on indices of psychosocial wellbeing among older adults living in residential care. Using a mixed-methods study design, 18 older adults were exposed to VR tourism three times a week, over six weeks. Participants reported decreased anxiety and fatigue immediately following exposure, and increased social engagement and quality of life following six weeks of VR tourism. Qualitative data offered additional insight on the process by which VR tourism may enhance wellbeing. Findings suggest that immersive VR tourism may be a viable program for older adults in residential care."
https://openalex.org/W3160806814,"Coordinating the charging scheduling of electric vehicles for dynamic dial-a-ride services is challenging considering charging queuing delays and stochastic customer demand. We propose a new two-stage solution approach to handle dynamic vehicle charging scheduling to minimize the costs of daily charging operations of the fleet. The approach comprises two components: daily vehicle charging scheduling and online vehicle–charger assignment. A new battery replenishment model is proposed to obtain the vehicle charging schedules by minimizing the costs of vehicle daily charging operations while satisfying vehicle driving needs to serve customers. In the second stage, an online vehicle–charger assignment model is developed to minimize the total vehicle idle time for charges by considering queuing delays at the level of chargers. An efficient Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is proposed to solve the large-scale vehicle-charger assignment problem with small optimality gaps. The approach is applied to a realistic dynamic dial-a-ride service case study in Luxembourg and compared with the nearest charging station charging policy and first-come-first-served minimum charging delay policy under different charging infrastructure scenarios. Our computational results show that the approach can achieve significant savings for the operator in terms of charging waiting times (–74.9%), charging times (–38.6%), and charged energy costs (–27.4%). A sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of the different model parameters, showing the scalability and robustness of the approach in a stochastic environment."
https://openalex.org/W3162642574,"Steep canyons surrounded by high mountains resulting from large-scale landslides characterize the study area located in the southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. A total of 1766 large landslides were identified based on integrated remote sensing interpretations utilizing multisource satellite images and topographic data that were dominated by 3 major regional categories, namely, rockslides, rock falls, and flow-like landslides. The geographical detector method was applied to quantitatively unveil the spatial association between the landslides and 12 environmental factors through computation of the q values based on spatially stratified heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a certainty factor (CF) model was used for comparison. The results indicate that the q values of the 12 influencing factors vary obviously, and the dominant factors are also different for the 3 types of landslides, with annual mean precipitation (AMP) being the dominant factor for rockslide distribution, elevation being the dominant factor for rock fall distribution and lithology being the dominant factor for flow-like distribution. Integrating the results of the factor detector and ecological detector, the AMP, annual mean temperature (AMT), elevation, river density, fault distance and lithology have a stronger influence on the spatial distribution of landslides than other factors. Furthermore, the factor interactions can significantly enhance their interpretability of landslides, and the top 3 dominant interactions were revealed. Based on statistics of landslide discrepancies with respect to diverse stratification of each factor, the high-risk zones were identified for 3 types of landslides, and the results were contrasted with the CF model. In conclusion, our method provides an objective framework for landslide prevention and mitigation through quantitative, spatial and statistical analyses in regions with complex terrain."
https://openalex.org/W3161099407,"The ability to monitor population dynamics and detect major changes in population trend is essential for wildlife conservation and management. However, this is often challenging for cetaceans as surveys typically cover only a portion of a population's range and conventional stock assessment methods cannot then distinguish whether apparent changes in abundance reflect real changes in population size or shifts in distribution. We developed and tested methods for estimating population size and trend and detecting changes in population trend in the context of shifting habitat by integrating additional data into distance-sampling analysis. Previous research has shown that incorporating habitat information can improve population size estimates for highly mobile species with dynamic spatial distributions. Here, using simulated datasets representative of a large whale population, we demonstrate that incorporating individual mark-recapture data can increase the accuracy and precision of trend estimation and the power to distinguish whether apparent changes in abundance reflect changes in population trend or distribution shifts. We recommend that similar simulation studies are conducted for specific cetacean populations to assess the potential for detecting changes in population dynamics given available data. This approach is especially important wherever population change may be confounded with long-term change in distribution patterns associated with regime shifts or climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3161282217,"The NATURE-HF registry was aimed to describe clinical epidemiology and 1-year outcomes of outpatients and inpatients with heart failure (HF). This is a prospective, multicenter, observational survey conducted in Tunisian Cardiology centers. A total of 2040 patients were included in the study. Of these, 1632 (80%) were outpatients with chronic HF (CHF). The mean hospital stay was 8.7 ± 8.2 days. The mortality rate during the initial hospitalization event for AHF was 7.4%. The all-cause 1-year mortality rate was 22.8% among AHF patients and 10.6% among CHF patients. Among CHF patients, the older age, diabetes, anemia, reduced EF, ischemic etiology, residual congestion and the absence of ACEI/ ARBs treatment were independent predictors of 1-year cumulative rates of rehospitalization and mortality. The female sex and the functional status were independent predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization in AHF patients. This study confirmed that acute HF is still associated with a poor prognosis, while the mid-term outcomes in patients with chronic HF seems to be improved. Some differences across countries may be due to different clinical characteristics and differences in healthcare systems."
https://openalex.org/W3162434838,"Background Child tuberculosis (TB) contact management is recommended for preventing TB in children but its implementation is suboptimal in high TB/HIV-burden settings. The PREVENT Study was a mixed-methods, clustered-randomized implementation study that evaluated the effectiveness and acceptability of a community-based intervention (CBI) to improve child TB contact management in Lesotho, a high TB burden country. Methods Ten health facilities were randomized to CBI or standard of care (SOC). CBI holistically addressed the complex provider-, patient-, and caregiver-related barriers to prevention of childhood TB. Routine TB program data were abstracted from TB registers and cards for all adult TB patients aged &gt;18 years registered during the study period, and their child contacts. Primary outcome was yield (number) of child contacts identified and screened per adult TB patient. Generalized linear mixed models tested for differences between study arms. CBI acceptability was assessed via semi-structured in-depth interviews with a purposively selected sample of 20 healthcare providers and 28 caregivers. Qualitative data were used to explain and confirm quantitative results. We used thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results From 01/2017-06/2018, 973 adult TB patients were recorded, 490 at CBI and 483 at SOC health facilities; 64% male, 68% HIV-positive. At CBI and SOC health facilities, 216 and 164 child contacts were identified, respectively (p = 0.16). Screening proportions (94% vs. 62%, p = 0.13) were similar; contact yield per TB case (0.40 vs. 0.20, p = 0.08) was higher at CBI than SOC health facilities, respectively. CBI was acceptable to caregivers and healthcare providers. Conclusion Identification and screening for TB child contacts were similar across study arms but yield was marginally higher at CBI compared with SOC health facilities. CBI scale-up may enhance the ability to reach and engage child TB contacts, contributing to efforts to improve TB prevention among children."

https://openalex.org/W3162675581,"In cage-free systems, laying hens must lay their eggs in the nests. Selecting layers based on nesting behavior would be a good strategy for improving egg production in these breeding systems. However, little is known about the genetic determinism of nest-related traits. Laying rate in the nests (LRN), clutch number (CN), oviposition traits (OT), and nest acceptance for laying (NAL) of 1,430 Rhode Island Red (RIR) hens and 1,008 White Leghorn (WL) hens were recorded in floor pens provided with individual electronic nests. Heritability and genetic and phenotypic correlations of all traits were estimated over two recording periods–the peak (24–43 weeks of age) and the middle (44–64 weeks of age) of production–by applying the restricted maximum likelihood method to an animal model. The mean oviposition time (MOT) ranged from 2 h 5 min to 3 h and from 3 h 35 min to 3 h 44 min after turning on the lights for RIR and WL hens, respectively. The mean oviposition interval ranged from 24 h 3 min to 24 h 16 min. All heritability and correlation estimates were similar for RIR and WL. Low to moderate heritability coefficients were estimated for LRN (0.04–0.25) and moderate to high heritability coefficients for CN and OT (0.27–0.68). CN and OT were negatively genetically correlated with LRN (-0.92 to -0.39) except during peak production for RIR (-0.30 to +0.43). NAL was weakly to moderately heritable (0.13–0.26). Genetic correlations between NAL and other traits were low to moderate (-0.41 to +0.44). In conclusion, CN and OT are promising selection criteria to improve egg production in cage-free systems. NAL can be also used to reduce the number of eggs laid off-nest in these breeding systems. However, variability in MOT must be maintained to limit competition for the nests."

To identify genetic factors contributing to vitamin D and BMD measures, association analysis of >14M variants was conducted in a maximum of 697 African American-Diabetes Heart Study participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The most significant association signals were detected for VDBP on chromosome 4; variants rs7041 (β = 0.44, SE = 0.019, P = 9.4x10-86) and rs4588 (β = 0.17, SE = 0.021, P = 3.5x10-08) in the group-specific component (vitamin D binding protein) gene (GC). These variants were found to be independently associated. In addition, rs7041 was also associated with bioavailable vitamin D (BAVD; β = 0.16, SE = 0.02, P = 3.3x10-19). Six rare variants were significantly associated with 25OHD, including a non-synonymous variant in HSPG2 (rs116788687; β = -1.07, SE = 0.17, P = 2.2x10-10) and an intronic variant in TNIK (rs143555701; β = -1.01, SE = 0.18, P = 9.0x10-10), both biologically related to bone development. Variants associated with 25OHD failed to replicate in African Americans from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Family Study (IRASFS). Evaluation of vitamin D metabolism and bone mineral density phenotypes in an African American population enriched for T2D could provide insight into ethnic specific differences in vitamin D metabolism and bone mineral density."
https://openalex.org/W3161997412,"In out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs), the use of an automatic external defibrillator (AED) by a bystander remains low, as AEDs may be misplaced with respect to the locations of OHCAs. As the distribution of historical OHCAs is potentially predictive of future OHCA locations, the purpose of this study is to assess AED positioning with regard to past locations of OHCAs, in order to improve the efficiency of public access defibrillation programs.This is a retrospective observational study from 2014 to 2018. The locations of historical OHCAs and AEDs were loaded into a geodata processing tool. Median distances between AEDs were collected, as well as the number and rates of OHCAs covered (distance of <100 meters from the nearest AED). Areas with high densities of uncovered OHCAs (hotspots) were identified in order to propose the placement of additional AEDs. Areas over-covered by AEDs (overlays) were also identified in order to propose the relocation of overlapping AEDs.There were 2,971 OHCA, 79.3% of which occurred at home, and 633 AEDs included in the study. The global coverage rate was 7.5%. OHCAs occurring at home had a coverage rate of 4.5%. Forty hotspots were identified, requiring the same number of additional AEDs. The addition of these would increase the coverage from 7.5% to 17.6%. Regarding AED overlays, 17 AEDs were found to be relocatable without reducing the AED coverage of historical OHCAs.This study confirms that geodata tools can assess AED locations and increase the efficiency of their placement. Historical hotspots and AED overlays should be considered, with the aim of efficiently relocating or adding AEDs. At-home OHCAs should become a priority target for future public access defibrillation programs as they represent the majority of OHCAs but have the lowest AED coverage rates."
https://openalex.org/W3160650238,"Microbial communities are of considerable significance for biogeochemical processes, for the health of both animals and plants, and for biotechnological purposes. A key feature of microbial interactions is the exchange of nutrients between cells. Isotope labelling followed by analysis with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) can identify nutrient fluxes and heterogeneity of substrate utilisation on a single cell level. Here we present a novel approach that combines SIMS experiments with mechanistic modelling to reveal otherwise inaccessible nutrient kinetics. The method is applied to study the onset of a synthetic mutualistic partnership between a vitamin B12-dependent mutant of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the B12-producing, heterotrophic bacterium Mesorhizobium japonicum, which is supported by algal photosynthesis. Results suggest that an initial pool of fixed carbon delays the onset of mutualistic cross-feeding; significantly, our approach allows the first quantification of this expected delay. Our method is widely applicable to other microbial systems, and will contribute to furthering a mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3160684778,"Although rodents represent approximately 40% of all living mammalian species, our knowledge regarding their reproductive biology is still scarce. Due to their high vulnerability to environmental changes, wild rodents have become beneficial models for ecological studies. Thus, we aimed to comparatively investigate key functional testis parameters in four sexually mature wild rodent species (A. cursor, A. montensis, N. lasiurus, and O. nigripes). These species belong to the Cricetidae family, which is the most diverse family of rodents in South America, with a total of ~120 species in Brazil. The results found for the gonadosomatic index and the sickled sperm head shape observed strongly suggest that the species here evaluated are promiscuous, prolific, and short-lived. The duration of spermatogenesis was relatively short and varied from ~35-40 days. Both the percentage of seminiferous tubules (ST) in the testis parenchyma (~95-97%) and the number of Sertoli cells (SC) (~48-70 million) per testis gram were very high, whereas a fairly good SC efficiency (~8-13 round spermatids per SC) was observed. In comparison to other mammalian species studied, particularly the rodents of the suborder Myomorpha (i.e. hamsters, rats and mice), the rodents herein investigated exhibited very high (~62-80 million) daily sperm production per testis gram. This impressive spermatogenic efficiency resulted mainly from the short duration of spermatogenesis and quite high values found for the ST percentage in the testis and the SC number per testis gram. We expect that the knowledge here obtained will help conservation programs and the proper management of wildlife."
https://openalex.org/W3162126936,"Little research has explored the influence of social context on health of Indian adolescents. We conceptualized community-level women's education (proxy for value placed on women's wellbeing) as exerting contextual influence on adolescent hemoglobin level and body mass index (BMI).We derived our sample of more than 62,000 adolescent aged 15 through 17 years from the Indian National Family Health Survey 2015-16. The sample consisted of a total of 62648 adolescents (54232 girls and 8416 boys) for the hemoglobin, and 62846 adolescents (54383 girls and 8463 boys) for the BMI analysis. We fitted multilevel random intercepts linear regression models to test the association of village- and urban-ward-level-women's education with hemoglobin level and BMI of adolescents, accounting for their own and their mother's education; as well as relevant covariates.Our fully adjusted model estimated that if the 52% of communities with less than 20 percent of women having a tenth-grade education in our sample were to achieve 100 percent tenth-grade completion in women, hemoglobin would be 0·2 g/dl higher (p<0·001) and BMI would be 0·62 kg/m2 higher on average among all adolescents in such communities. Unexplained variance estimates at the contextual level remained statistically significant, indicating the importance of context on adolescent undernutrition.Adolescents are deeply embedded in their context, influenced by contextual factors affecting health. Promoting adolescent health therefore implies altering social norms related to adolescent health and health behaviors; along with structural changes creating a health-promoting environment. Integrating our empirical findings with theoretically plausible pathways connecting community-level women's education with adolescent undernutrition, we suggest that enhancing community-level women's education beyond high school is necessary to facilitate these processes.Addressing contextual determinants of adolescent undernutrition might be the missing link in India's adolescent anemia and undernutrition prevention efforts, which are currently focused heavily on individual-level biomedical determinants of the problem."
https://openalex.org/W3162163051,"Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) addition has increased soil nutrient availability, thereby affecting ecosystem processes and functions in N-limited ecosystems. Long-term N addition decreases plant biodiversity, but the effects of short-term N addition on soil microbial community is poorly understood. The present study examined the impacts of short-term N addition (NH 4 NO 3 ) on these factors in a sandy grassland and semi-fixed sandy land in the Horqin Sandy Land. We measured the responses of soil microbial biomass C and N; on soil β-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity; and soil microflora characteristics to N additions gradient with 0 (control), 5 (N5), 10 (N10), and 15 (N15) g N m −2 yr −1 . The soil microbial biomass indices, NAG activity, and soil microflora characteristics did not differ significantly among the N levels, and there was no difference at the two sites. The competition for N between plants and soil microbes was not eliminated by short-term N addition due to the low soil nutrient and moisture contents, and the relationships among the original soil microbes did not change. However, N addition increased BG activity in the N5 and N10 additions in the sandy grassland, and in the N5, N10, and N15 additions in the semi-fixed sandy land. This may be due to increased accumulation and fixation of plant litter into soils in response to N addition, leading to increased microbial demand for a C source and increased soil BG activity. Future research should explore the relationships between soil microbial community and N addition at the two sites."
https://openalex.org/W3162892385,"To assess Australian physiotherapists' knowledge about, attitudes towards, and self-reported use of shared decision making, as well as perceived barriers to its implementation in practice.Physiotherapists registered for a national Australian physiotherapy conference were invited via email and the conference app to complete a self-administered online questionnaire about shared decision making, including: a) knowledge, b) attitude to and reported approach in practice, c) behaviours used, d) barriers, e) previous training and future training interest. Responses were analysed descriptively and open-ended questions synthesised narratively.372 physiotherapists (71% female, mean age 45 years, mean experience 23 years) completed the survey. Respondents had a good level of knowledge on most questions, with correct responses ranging from 39.5% to 98.5% of participants, and a generally positive attitude towards shared decision making, believing it useful to most practice areas. Sixty percent indicated they make decisions with their patients and there was general agreement between how decisions should be made and how they are actually made. The behaviour with the lowest reported occurrence was explaining the relevant research evidence about the benefits and harms of the options. The main perceived barriers were patient knowledge and confidence, consequent fewer physiotherapy sessions, and time constraints. Most (79%) were keen to learn more about shared decision making.Shared decision making is of growing importance to all health professions and rarely studied in physical therapy. This sample of Australian physiotherapists had a generally positive attitude to shared decision making and learning more about it. Opportunities for providing such skills training at the undergraduate level and in continuing professional development should be explored. This training should ensure that the communicating evidence component of shared decision making is addressed as well as debunking myths about perceived barriers to its implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3160751146,"Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common gynecological disorder characterized by cramping pain in the lower abdomen during menstruation, in the absence of identifiable pathology. While Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is used to promote PD pain relief, there is still a need to understand the parameters and cost-effectiveness of this intervention. As such, this study aims to disclose a study that will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TENS on pain intensity in women with PD. This is a protocol for an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial that includes 174 women with PD, &gt;18 years old, with menstrual pain greater than or equal to four points in the Numerical Rating Scale. Participants will be randomized into three groups (active TENS, placebo TENS, and educational booklet). Participants allocated to the active TENS group will receive electrical stimulation (F = 100 Hz, pulse duration = 200 μs, for 30 min). In contrast, the placebo TENS group will receive placebo stimulation (same parameters, but for only 30 s, and then the current will be ramped off over a 15-s time frame) for three consecutive months during menstruation. Participants allocated to the educational booklet group will receive instructions about health promotion and education actions related to PD. A blinded assessor will evaluate the pain intensity (Numerical Rating Scale), presenteeism (Stanford Presenteeism Scale), Health-Related Quality of Life (Short-Form 6 dimensions and SF-36), and health costs of menstrual pain. This is the first study to propose a health economic evaluation while assessing the benefits of using TENS to treat PD symptoms. It is hypothesized that active TENS will be more effective than placebo TENS or the educational booklet in improving clinical outcomes in the short-, medium- and long-term. The study will also provide information about the cost-effectiveness of TENS, which can be used by policy makers to improve PD care in public and private health systems."
https://openalex.org/W3162045865,"Species with congruent geographical distributions, potentially caused by common historical and ecological spatial processes, constitute biogeographical units called chorotypes. Nevertheless, the degree of spatial range congruence characterizing these groups of species is rarely used as an explicit parameter. Methods conceived for the identification of patterns of shared ranges often suffer from scale bias associated with the use of grids, or the incapacity to describe the full complexity of patterns, from core areas of high spatial congruence, to long gradients of range distributions expanding from these core areas. Here, we propose a simple analytical method, Spatial Congruence Analysis (SCAN), which identifies chorotypes by mapping direct and indirect spatial relationships among species. Assessments are made under a referential value of congruence as an explicit numerical parameter. A one-layered network connects species (vertices) using pairwise spatial congruence estimates (edges). This network is then analyzed for each species, separately, by an algorithm which searches for spatial relationships to the reference species. The method was applied to two datasets: a simulated gradient of ranges and real distributions of birds. The simulated dataset showed that SCAN can describe gradients of distribution with a high level of detail. The bird dataset showed that only a small portion of range overlaps is biogeographically meaningful, and that there is a large variation in types of patterns that can be found with real distributions. Species analyzed separately may converge on similar or identical groups, may be nested in larger chorotypes, or may even generate overlapped patterns with no species in common. Chorotypes can vary from simple ones, composed by few highly congruent species, to complex, with numerous alternative component species and spatial configurations, which offer insights about possible processes driving these patterns in distinct degrees of spatial congruence. Metrics such as congruence, depth, richness, and ratio between common and total areas can be used to describe chorotypes in detail, allowing comparisons between patterns across regions and taxa."
https://openalex.org/W3162186910,"Projections of future global human population are traditionally made using birth/death trend extrapolations, but these methods ignore limits. Expressing humanity as a K-selected species whose numbers are limited by the global carrying capacity produces a different outlook. Population data for the second millennium up to the year 1970 was fit to a hyper-exponential growth equation, where the rate constant for growth itself grows exponentially due to growth of life-saving technology. The discrepancies between the projected growth and the actual population data since 1970 are accounted for by a decrease in the global carrying capacity due to ecosystem degradation. A system dynamics model that best fits recent population numbers suggests that the global biocapacity may already have been reduced to one-half of its historical value and global carrying capacity may be at its 1965 level and falling. Simulations suggest that population may soon peak or may have already peaked. Population projections depend strongly on the unknown fragility or robustness of the Earth’s essential ecosystem services that affect agricultural production. Numbers for the 2020 global census were not available for this study."
https://openalex.org/W3163576504,"In the emerging new agricultural context, a drastic reduction in fertilizer usage is required. A promising way to maintain high crop yields while reducing fertilizer inputs is to breed new varieties with optimized root system architecture (RSA), designed to reach soil resources more efficiently. This relies on identifying key traits that underlie genotypic variability and plasticity of RSA in response to nutrient availability. The aim of our study was to characterize the RSA plasticity in response to nitrogen limitation of a set of contrasted oilseed rape genotypes, by using the ArchiSimple model parameters as screening traits. Eight accessions of Brassica napus were grown in long tubes in the greenhouse, under two contrasting levels of nitrogen availability. After plant excavation, roots were scanned at high resolution. Six RSA traits relative to root diameter, elongation rate and branching were measured, as well as nine growth and biomass allocation traits. The plasticity of each trait to nitrogen availability was estimated. Nitrogen-limited plants were characterized by a strong reduction in total biomass and leaf area. Even if the architecture traits were shown to be less plastic than allocation traits, significant nitrogen and genotype effects were highlighted on each RSA trait, except the root minimal diameter. Thus, the RSA of nitrogen-limited plants was primarily characterised by a reduced lateral root density, a smaller primary root diameter, associated with a stronger root dominance. Among the RSA traits measured, the inter-branch distance showed the highest plasticity with a level of 70%, in the same range as the most plastic allocation traits. This work suggests that lateral root density plays the key role in the adaptation of the root system to nitrogen availability and highlights inter-branch distance as a major target trait for breeding new varieties, better adapted to low input systems."

Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy presents a sensitive and cost-effective alternative for analysis of PM organic fraction. However, as with other analytical chemistry methods, the miniaturization is hindered by a solvent extraction step and a need for benchtop instrumentation. We present a methodology for collecting and in-situ analysis of airborne nanoparticles that eliminates labor-intensive sample preparation and miniaturizes the detection platform. Nanoparticles are electrostatically collected onto a transparent substrate coated with solid-phase (SP) solvent-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The PM organic fraction is extracted into PDMS and analyzed in-situ, thus avoiding liquid-phase extraction. In the SP-EEM analysis, we evaluated external and internal excitation schemes. Internal excitation shows the lowest scattering interference but leads to signal masking from PDMS fluorescence for λ<250nm. The external excitation EEM spectra are dependent on the excitation light incident angle; ranges of 30-40° and 55-65° show the best results. SP-EEM spectra of woodsmoke and cigarette smoke samples are in good agreement with the EEM spectra of liquid-phase extracts. The SP-EEM technique can be used to develop wearable sensors for exposure assessments and environmental monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3161917758,"Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) aims to visualize the internal high-frequency conductivity distribution at Larmor frequency using the B1 transceive phase data. From the magnetic field perturbation by the electrical field associated with the radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field, the high-frequency conductivity and permittivity distributions inside the human brain have been reconstructed based on the Maxwell's equation. Starting from the Maxwell's equation, the complex permittivity can be described as a second order elliptic partial differential equation. The established reconstruction algorithms have focused on simplifying and/or regularizing the elliptic partial differential equation to reduce the noise artifact. Using the nonlinear relationship between the Maxwell's equation, measured magnetic field, and conductivity distribution, we design a deep learning model to visualize the high-frequency conductivity in the brain, directly derived from measured magnetic flux density. The designed moving local window multi-layer perceptron (MLW-MLP) neural network by sliding local window consisting of neighboring voxels around each voxel predicts the high-frequency conductivity distribution in each local window. The designed MLW-MLP uses a family of multiple groups, consisting of the gradients and Laplacian of measured B1 phase data, as the input layer in a local window. The output layer of MLW-MLP returns the conductivity values in each local window. By taking a non-local mean filtering approach in the local window, we reconstruct a noise suppressed conductivity image while maintaining spatial resolution. To verify the proposed method, we used B1 phase datasets acquired from eight human subjects (five subjects for training procedure and three subjects for predicting the conductivity in the brain)."

https://openalex.org/W3163082212,"Purpose This study aimed to determine the risk and time trends of herpes zoster among patients with head and neck cancer, with or without radiotherapy. Methods A total of 2160 patients with head and neck cancer were enrolled. The radiotherapy and non- radiotherapy cohorts were frequency-matched at a 1:1 ratio according to sex, age, and index date. Moreover, 1080 matched non-cancer individuals were considered normal controls. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database and Cancer Registry. The primary end point was the incidence of herpes zoster, and the adjusted confounding factors were age, sex, comorbidities, oncological surgery, and chemotherapy. Results The incidence of herpes zoster was higher in cancer patients than in non-cancer individuals but did not significantly differ (13.67 vs. 8.06 per 1,000 person-years, p = 0.18). The risk of herpes zoster was significantly higher in the radiotherapy cohort than in the non-radiotherapy cohort (18.55 vs. 9.06 per 1,000 person-years, p = 0.03). The 5-year incidence rates in the radiotherapy and non-radiotherapy cohorts were 8.9% and 5%, respectively ( p &lt; 0.0001). Survival analysis indicated there was no immortal time bias. The time trends in the radiotherapy cohort persistently showed a high risk within the first 2 years, which decreased thereafter. Only patients with comorbid rheumatoid arthritis showed a significantly high risk of herpes zoster ( p = 0.02). Oncological surgery and chemotherapy had no impact on the development of herpes zoster. Conclusions This nationwide population-based study showed that patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy are at an increased risk of herpes zoster. Health care professionals should pay more attention to this vulnerable group to improve their quality of life."

This study investigated the association between birth month and child gross motor development at 6 and 12 months of age in a large cohort of infants (n = 72,203) participating in the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). Gross motor development was assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). At 6 months and 12 months, 20.7% and 14.2%, respectively, had ASQ-3 indications of gross motor problems. Birth month was strongly associated with gross motor development at both time points, particularly at 6 months. Summer-born infants had the worst outcomes at both 6 months and 12 months of age. This outcome applied to the ASQ-3 score itself and to the adjusted Relative Risk (aRR), with the highest aRRs (relative to January-born) among August-born (aRR 2.51; 95%CI 2.27-2.78 at 6 months), and June-born (aRR 1.84; 95%CI 1.63-2.09 at 12 months).

However, understanding of these factors is necessary for the development of novel therapeutic agents for small-bowel cancer. Thus, we aimed to identify the clinicopathological features and genomic variants associated with its prognosis and recurrence. We retrospectively examined 24 consecutive patients with primary small-bowel cancer surgically treated between May 2005 and August 2018 and collected 29 tumor specimens. The 29 lesions were subjected to mismatch repair status evaluation, using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and targeted genomic sequencing, after which they were analyzed using a panel of 90 cancer-related genes. IHC revealed that 45% (13/29) of the lesions exhibited deficient mismatch repair. The most common genomic variants in small-bowel cancers were in TP53 (48%, 13/27), followed by KRAS (44%, 12/27), ARID1A (33%, 9/27), PIK3CA (26%, 7/27), APC (26%, 7/27), and SMAD4 , NOTCH3 , CREBBP , PTCH1 , and EP300 (22%, 6/27 each). Overall survival and disease-specific survival of patients with tumor mutational burden (TMB) ≥10 mutations/Mb (n = 17) were significantly better than those of patients with TMB &lt;10 mutations/Mb (n = 6). Additionally, patients with a mutant SMAD4 had poorer recurrence-free survival than those with wild-type SMAD4 . Our results suggested that TMB and SMAD4 mutations were associated with the prognosis of small-bowel cancer patients. Thus, cancer genomic analysis could be useful in the search for biomarkers of prognosis prediction in small-bowel cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3163256268,"The acetylation of H4 lysine 16 (H4 K16Ac) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae counteracts the binding of the heterochromatin complex SIR to chromatin and inhibits gene silencing. Contrary to other histone acetylation marks, the H4 K16Ac level is high on genes with low transcription, whereas highly transcribed genes show low H4 K16Ac. Approximately 60% of cellular H4 K16Ac in S. cerevisiae is provided by the SAS-I complex, which consists of the MYST-family acetyltransferase Sas2, Sas4 and Sas5. The absence of SAS-I causes inappropriate spreading of the SIR complex and gene silencing in subtelomeric regions. Here, we investigated the genome-wide dynamics of SAS-I dependent H4 K16Ac during DNA replication. Replication is highly disruptive to chromatin and histone marks, since histones are removed to allow progression of the replication fork, and chromatin is reformed with old and new histones after fork passage. We found that H4 K16Ac appears in chromatin immediately upon replication. Importantly, this increase depends on the presence of functional SAS-I complex. Moreover, the appearance of H4 K16Ac is delayed in genes that are strongly transcribed. This indicates that transcription counteracts SAS-I-mediated H4 K16 acetylation, thus ""sculpting"" histone modification marks at the time of replication. We furthermore investigated which acetyltransferase acts redundantly with SAS-I to acetylate H4 K16Ac. esa1Δ sds3Δ cells, which were also sas2Δ sir3Δ in order to maintain viability, contained no detectable H4 K16Ac, showing that Esa1 and Sas2 are redundant for cellular H4 K16 acetylation. Furthermore, esa1Δ sds3Δ sas2Δ sir3Δ showed a more pronounced growth defect compared to the already defective esa1Δ sds3Δ sir3Δ. This indicates that SAS-I has cellular functions beyond preventing the spreading of heterochromatin."
https://openalex.org/W3163605292,"Multisensory facilitation is known to improve the perceptual performances and reaction times of participants in a wide range of tasks, from detection and discrimination to memorization. We asked whether a multimodal signal can similarly improve action inhibition using the stop-signal paradigm. Indeed, consistent with a crossmodal redundant signal effect that relies on multisensory neuronal integration, the threshold for initiating behavioral responses is known for being reached faster with multisensory stimuli. To evaluate whether this phenomenon also occurs for inhibition, we compared stop signals in unimodal (human faces or voices) versus audiovisual modalities in natural or degraded conditions. In contrast to the expected multisensory facilitation, we observed poorer inhibition efficiency in the audiovisual modality compared with the visual and auditory modalities. This result was corroborated by both response probabilities and stop-signal reaction times. The visual modality (faces) was the most effective. This is the first demonstration of an audiovisual impairment in the domain of perception and action. It suggests that when individuals are engaged in a high-level decisional conflict, bimodal stimulation is not processed as a simple multisensory object improving the performance but is perceived as concurrent visual and auditory information. This absence of unity increases task demand and thus impairs the ability to revise the response."

Multivariate statistical analysis using XCMS Online showed the abundance of γ-Glu allyl cysteine in Batanes-sourced garlic while γ-Glu propenyl cysteine, γ-Glu methyl cysteine, and alliin are enriched in the Ilocos cultivar. Principal component analysis showed that the γ-Glu dipeptides found in local garlic influenced their distinct separation across PC1 from imported varieties. This presence of high levels of γ-Glu dipeptides and probiotic oligosaccharides may potentially contribute to the superior flavor and nutritional benefits of Philippine garlic."
https://openalex.org/W3163693684,"Motivation Local protein structure is usually described via classifying each peptide to a unique class from a set of pre-defined structures. These classifications may differ in the number of structural classes, the length of peptides, or class attribution criteria. Most methods that predict the local structure of a protein from its sequence first rely on some classification and only then proceed to the 3D conformation assessment. However, most classification methods rely on homologous proteins’ existence, unavoidably lose information by attributing a peptide to a single class or suffer from a suboptimal choice of the representative classes. Results To alleviate the above challenges, we propose a method that constructs a peptide’s structural representation from the sequence, reflecting its similarity to several basic representative structures. For 5-mer peptides and 16 representative structures, we achieved the Q16 classification accuracy of 67.9%, which is higher than what is currently reported in the literature. Our prediction method does not utilize information about protein homologues but relies only on the amino acids’ physicochemical properties and the resolved structures’ statistics. We also show that the 3D coordinates of a peptide can be uniquely recovered from its structural coordinates, and show the required conditions under various geometric constraints."

In horses, this degenerative disorder of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is described as recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). The dysfunctional innervation of the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle (CAD) leads to a loss of performance in affected horses. In general, ex vivo models of the larynx are rare and for equine patients, just one short report is available. To allow for testing new therapy approaches in an isolated organ model, we examined equine larynges in a constant pressure perfused setup. In order to check the vitality and functionality of the isolated larynx, the vessels´ reaction to norepinephrine (NE) and sodium nitroprusside (NP) as vasoactive agents was tested. Additionally, the contractility of the CAD was checked via electrical stimulation. To determine the extent of hypoxic alterations, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lactate were measured and an immunofluorescent analysis of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), a key transcription factor in hypoxia, was performed. For this, a hypoxia-induced cell culture for HIF-1α was developed. The application of NE led to an expected vasoconstriction while NP caused the expected vasodilation. During a perfusion period of 352 ±20.78 min, LDH values were in the reference range and lactate values slightly exceeded the reference range at the end of the perfusion. HIF-1α nuclear translocation could reliably be detected in the hypoxia-induced cell cultures, but not in sections of the perfused CAD. With the approach presented here, a solid basis for perfusing equine larynges was established and may serve as a tool for further investigations of equine larynx disorders as well as a transferrable model for other species."
https://openalex.org/W3160406737,"American Criollo pigs are thought to descend mainly from those imported from the Iberian Peninsula starting in the late 15th century. Criollo pigs subsequently expanded throughout the Americas, adapting to very diverse environments, and possibly receiving influences from other origins. With the intensification of agriculture in the mid-20th century, cosmopolitan breeds largely replaced Criollo pigs, and the few remaining are mostly maintained by rural communities in marginal areas where they still play an important socio-economic and cultural role. In this study, we used 24 microsatellite markers in samples from 1715 pigs representing 46 breeds with worldwide distribution, including 17 American Criollo breeds, with the major focus of investigating their genetic diversity, structure and breed relationships. We also included representatives of the Iberian, Local British, Hungarian, Chinese and Commercial breeds, as well as Wild Boar, in order to investigate their possible influence in the genetic composition of Criollos. Our results show that, when compared with the other breeds, Criollo pigs present higher levels of genetic diversity, both in terms of allelic diversity and expected heterozygosity. The various analyses indicate that breed differentiation overall explains nearly 21% of the total genetic diversity. Criollo breeds showed their own identity and shared a common genetic background, tending to cluster together in various analyses, even though they differ from each other. A close relationship of Criollos with Iberian breeds was revealed by all the different analyses, and the contribution of Iberian breeds, particularly of the Celtic breeds, is still present in various Criollo breeds. No influence of Chinese breeds was detected on Criollos, but a few were influenced by Commercial breeds or by wild pigs. Our results confirm the uniqueness of American Criollo pigs and the role that Iberian breeds have played in their development."
https://openalex.org/W3161944991,"A technique to localize a radiological target on the head convexity fast and with acceptable precision is sufficient for surgeries of superficial intracranial lesions, and of help in the setting of emergency surgery, computer navigation breakdown, limited resources and education. We present a caliper technique based on fundamental geometry, with inexpensive and globally available tools (conventional CT or MRI image viewer, calculator, caliper).The distances of the radiological target from two landmarks (nasion and porus acusticus externus) are assessed with an image viewer and Pythagoras' theorem. The two distances are then marked around the landmarks onto the head of the patient with help of a caliper. The intersection defines the target. We tested the technique in a saw bone skull model and afterwards in the operating room. Convexity targets were localized with the caliper navigation technique and then with computer navigation as ground truth.In the saw bone model, the mean offset between the caliper navigated target and the real target was 2.9 ± 2.8 mm, 95% CI (1.6 mm; 4.2 mm). The mean offset between computer navigated target and real target was 1.6 ± 0.9 mm, 95% CI (1.2 mm; 2 mm) (ns). In 15 patients undergoing navigated cranial procedures, 100 targets were assessed in reference to computer navigation. The mean offset of the caliper navigation was 11 ± 5.2 mm, 95% CI (9.9 mm; 12 mm).This is a low-tech approach for translation of a radiological target to the patient's head in short time and with globally available inexpensive tools, with satisfying precision for many procedures."

A realistic model of the lung´s vein system was constructed and the active diffusive surface of capillaries and main vein was calculated and confirmed by geometrical measurements. We here present a model that is able to validate the measured oxygen consumption by the use of the Colburn analogy between mass and momentum transfer. By combining basic diffusion laws with the momentum transfer, i.e. wall shear stress, at the inner wall of the lung capillaries and the main vein, the progression of the oxygen mass fraction in the hemolymph can be visualized."
