Here, we show that adhesion of microbes to intestinal epithelial cells (ECs) is a critical cue for Th17 induction. Upon monocolonization of germ-free mice or rats with SFB indigenous to mice (M-SFB) or rats (R-SFB), M-SFB and R-SFB showed host-specific adhesion to small intestinal ECs, accompanied by host-specific induction of Th17 cells. Citrobacter rodentium and Escherichia coli O157 triggered similar Th17 responses, whereas adhesion-defective mutants of these microbes failed to do so. Moreover, a mixture of 20 bacterial strains, which were selected and isolated from fecal samples of a patient with ulcerative colitis on the basis of their ability to cause a robust induction of Th17 cells in the mouse colon, also exhibited EC-adhesive characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2194032958,"There is some evidence for a role of music training in boosting phonological awareness, word segmentation, working memory, as well as reading abilities in children with typical development. Poor performance in tasks requiring temporal processing, rhythm perception and sensorimotor synchronization seems to be a crucial factor underlying dyslexia in children. Interestingly, children with dyslexia show deficits in temporal processing, both in language and in music. Within this framework, we test the hypothesis that music training, by improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, improves phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia. The study is a prospective, multicenter, open randomized controlled trial, consisting of test, rehabilitation and re-test (ID NCT02316873). After rehabilitation, the music group (N = 24) performed better than the control group (N = 22) in tasks assessing rhythmic abilities, phonological awareness and reading skills. This is the first randomized control trial testing the effect of music training in enhancing phonological and reading abilities in children with dyslexia. The findings show that music training can modify reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. Through the enhancement of temporal processing and rhythmic skills, music might become an important tool in both remediation and early intervention programs.

https://openalex.org/W2115689937,"Message-specific translational control is required for gametogenesis. In yeast, the RNA-binding protein Rim4 mediates translational repression of numerous mRNAs, including the B-type cyclin CLB3, which is essential for establishing the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern. Here, we show that Rim4 forms amyloid-like aggregates and that it is the amyloid-like form of Rim4 that is the active, translationally repressive form of the protein. Our data further show that Rim4 aggregation is a developmentally regulated process. Starvation induces the conversion of monomeric Rim4 into amyloid-like aggregates, thereby activating the protein to bring about repression of translation. At the onset of meiosis II, Rim4 aggregates are abruptly degraded allowing translation to commence. Although amyloids are best known for their role in the etiology of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes by forming toxic protein aggregates, our findings show that cells can utilize amyloid-like protein aggregates to function as central regulators of gametogenesis."

IL-10 inhibits the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages to stimulate antigen-specific CD4 T cells; however, the mechanisms by which IL-10 suppresses antigen presentation remain poorly understood. We now report that IL-10 stimulates expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase March-I in activated macrophages, thereby down-regulating MHC-II, CD86, and antigen presentation to CD4 T cells. By contrast, IL-10 does not stimulate March-I expression in DCs, does not suppress MHC-II or CD86 expression on either resting or activated DCs, and does not affect antigen presentation by activated DCs. IL-10 does, however, inhibit the process of DC activation itself, thereby reducing the efficiency of antigen presentation in a March-I-independent manner. Thus, IL-10 suppression of antigen presenting cell function in macrophages is March-I-dependent, whereas in DCs, suppression is March- I-independent.

https://openalex.org/W2342398096,"In mouse mammary epithelial cells, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1) mediates the apical localization of ZO-1 mRNA, which encodes a critical tight junction component. In mice lacking CPEB1 and in cultured cells from which CPEB has been depleted, randomly distributed ZO-1 mRNA leads to the loss of cell polarity. We have investigated whether this diminution of polarity results in an epithelial-to-mesenchyme (EMT) transition and possible increased metastatic potential. Here, we show that CPEB1-depleted mammary epithelial cells alter their gene expression profile in a manner consistent with an EMT and also become motile, which are made particularly robust when cells are treated with transforming growth factor-β, an enhancer of EMT. CPEB1-depleted mammary cells become metastatic to the lung following injection into mouse fat pads while ectopically expressed CPEB1 prevents metastasis. Surprisingly, CPEB1 depletion causes some EMT/metastasis-related mRNAs to have shorter poly(A) tails while other mRNAs to have longer poly(A) tails. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) mRNA, which encodes a metastasis-promoting factor, undergoes poly(A) lengthening and enhanced translation upon CPEB reduction. Moreover, in human breast cancer cells that become progressively more metastatic, CPEB1 is reduced while MMP9 becomes more abundant. These data suggest that at least in part, CPEB1 regulation of MMP9 mRNA expression mediates metastasis of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2219778402,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are major epigenetic modulators involved in a broad spectrum of human diseases including cancers. As HDACs are promising targets of cancer therapy, it is important to understand the mechanisms of HDAC regulation. In this study, we show that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 4 (USP4) interacts directly with and deubiquitinates HDAC2, leading to the stabilization of HDAC2. Accumulation of HDAC2 in USP4-overexpression cells leads to compromised p53 acetylation as well as crippled p53 transcriptional activation, accumulation and apoptotic response upon DNA damage. Moreover, USP4 targets HDAC2 to downregulate tumor necrosis factor TNFα-induced nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation. Taken together, our study provides a novel insight into the ubiquitination and stability of HDAC2 and uncovers a previously unknown function of USP4 in cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2298328682,"Brain metastases (BM) are a devastating consequence of breast cancer. BM occur more frequently in patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer subtypes; HER2 overexpressing (HER2+) tumors and triple-negative (TN) (ER-, progesterone receptor-negative (PR-) and normal HER2) tumors. Young age is an independent risk factor for the development of BM, thus we speculated that higher circulating estrogens in young, pre-menopausal women could exert paracrine effects through the highly estrogen-responsive brain microenvironment. Using a TN experimental metastases model, we demonstrate that ovariectomy decreased the frequency of magnetic resonance imaging-detectable lesions by 56% as compared with estrogen supplementation, and that the combination of ovariectomy and letrozole further reduced the frequency of large lesions to 14.4% of the estrogen control. Human BM expressed 4.2-48.4% ER+ stromal area, particularly ER+ astrocytes. In vitro, E2-treated astrocytes increased proliferation, migration and invasion of 231BR-EGFP cells in an ER-dependent manner. E2 upregulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands Egf, Ereg and Tgfa mRNA and protein levels in astrocytes, and activated EGFR in brain metastatic cells. Co-culture of 231BR-EGFP cells with E2-treated astrocytes led to the upregulation of the metastatic mediator S100 Calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) (1.78-fold, P<0.05). Exogenous EGF increased S100A4 mRNA levels in 231BR-EGFP cells (1.40±0.02-fold, P<0.01 compared with vehicle control) and an EGFR/HER2 inhibitor blocked this effect, suggesting that S100A4 is a downstream effector of EGFR activation. Short hairpin RNA-mediated S100A4 silencing in 231BR-EGFP cells decreased their migration and invasion in response to E2-CM, abolished their increased proliferation in co-cultures with E2-treated astrocytes and decreased brain metastatic colonization. Thus, S100A4 is one effector of the paracrine action of E2 in brain metastatic cells. These studies provide a novel mechanism by which estrogens, acting through ER+ astrocytes in the brain microenvironment, can promote BM of TN breast cancers, and suggests existing endocrine agents may provide some clinical benefit towards reducing and managing BM."
https://openalex.org/W2204319585,"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has increasingly spread worldwide in the past decade. The prevalence and characteristics of CRE in Thailand are unknown. In this study, we conducted a 2-year surveillance of CRE among 12,741 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at the largest university hospital in Thailand with molecular characterization of beta-lactamase (bla) genes, including carbapenemase genes. The CRE prevalence was 1.4%. blaKPC-13 and blaIMP-14a were the only carbapenemase genes detected among these CRE isolates. blaKPC-13 gene was found in a single isolate of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, and blaIMP-14a was found in four isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates were resistant to multiple carbapenems at a higher ratio than other CRE species, and thus were further characterized for resistance phenotypes, bla genotypes and molecular epidemiology. Most CRKP isolates harboured multiple bla genes, especially those related to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Seven CRKP isolates were resistant to all tested carbapenems, and showed decreased ompK35 and/or ompK36 porin gene expression. Molecular typing of CRKP based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) demonstrated several unrelated clones. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was partially concordant with PFGE results and revealed that ST340, a member of drug-resistant K. pneumoniae clonal complex 258, was the most predominant clone, followed by ST48, ST11 and ST273. The novel ST1645 was identified from this study. ST340 has neither been shown to be predominated among CRKP from other studies, nor been reported in Thailand. Therefore, it emphases a critical concern to monitor and control the spread of CRKP."
https://openalex.org/W2259796700,"Alzheimer disease coincides with the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Aβ is typically 40 residues long (Aβ(1–40)) but can have variable C and N termini. Naturally occurring N-terminally truncated Aβ(11–40/42) is found in the cerebrospinal fluid and has a similar abundance to Aβ(1–42), constituting one-fifth of the plaque load. Based on its specific N-terminal sequence we hypothesized that truncated Aβ(11–40/42) would have an elevated affinity for Cu2+. Various spectroscopic techniques, complemented with transmission electron microscopy, were used to determine the properties of the Cu2+-Aβ(11–40/42) interaction and how Cu2+ influences amyloid fiber formation. We show that Cu2+-Aβ(11–40) forms a tetragonal complex with a 34 ± 5 fm dissociation constant at pH 7.4. This affinity is 3 orders of magnitude tighter than Cu2+ binding to Aβ(1–40/42) and more than an order of magnitude tighter than that of serum albumin, the extracellular Cu2+ transport protein. Furthermore, Aβ(11–40/42) forms fibers twice as fast as Aβ(1–40) with a very different morphology, forming bundles of very short amyloid rods. Substoichiometric Cu2+ drastically perturbs Aβ(11–40/42) assembly, stabilizing much longer fibers. The very tight fm affinity of Cu2+ for Aβ(11–40/42) explains the high levels of Cu2+ observed in Alzheimer disease plaques.

The most prevalent form of fatal neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer disease (AD), 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAβamyloid-βAPPamyloid precursor proteinCSFcerebrospinal fluidpEpyroglutamate allotypeHSAhuman serum albuminThTthioflavin TTEMtransmission electron microscopy. which directly affects more than 30 million people worldwide (1.Prince M.

Alzheimer's Disease International, London2009: 1-96Google Scholar). At the center of AD pathogenesis is the misfolding and self-assembly of an endogenous peptide, amyloid-β (Aβ), into oligomers and amyloid fibers found in the extracellular plaques of AD patients (2.Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Alzheimer's disease: the amyloid cascade hypothesis.Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5087) Google Scholar). Aβ is released as a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the action of the β and γ secretase complex, shown in Fig. 1. These secretases, which have variable site specificity for APP, produce different lengths of Aβ, reviewed by Kummer and Heneka (3.Kummer M.P. Heneka M.T.

In addition to variable C-terminal cleavage, with Aβ reportedly being 39–43 residues in length (4.Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K.

Exopeptidases such as aminopeptidase A are thought to be responsible for removing single residues from the N terminus of the peptide (6.Sevalle J. Amoyel A. Robert P. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.

However, the main N-truncated form of Aβ is generated by a secondary β-secretase activity (β′) localized to the trans-Golgi network which produces an N-terminally truncated Aβ(11–40/42);see Fig. 1 (9.Vassar R.

Aβ(11–40/42) has also been identified as one of the main allotypes of Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (11.Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. Isolation and quantification of soluble Alzheimer's β-peptide from biological fluids.Nature. 1992; 359: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). It is perhaps not widely appreciated that isolated plaques from sporadic AD patients show Aβ(11–42) with a similar abundance to Aβ(1–42) with relative proportions of Aβ(1–40) (45.8%), Aβ(1–42) (18.1%), and Aβ(11–42) (18.6%) (12.Näslund J.

Aβ(11–40/42) and the N-terminal pyroglutamate (pE) allotype (pE Aβ(11–40/42)) constitute 19% of the relative Aβ load in the plaques of AD and young adults with Down syndrome (13.Liu K. Solano I.

Glutaminyl cyclases unfold glutamyl cyclase activity under mild acid conditions.FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is also thought that pE forms slowly over time; for example, Aβ(11–40/42) detected in mouse models of AD contained no pyroglutamate, perhaps because these plaques form within 14 months (15.Kuo Y.M.

Interestingly, immunofluorescence has shown that pE Aβ(11–40/42) is concentrated at the core of plaques in AD brains, supporting the hypothesis that Aβ(11–40/42) could be one of the first amyloidogenic allotypes of Aβ to form plaques in AD (16.Sullivan C.P.

Furthermore, mutations in presenilin-1 (PS1) linked with familial AD increase levels of Aβ(1–42) but also, importantly, Aβ(11–42) (17.Sudoh S. Kawamura Y. Sato S. Wang R. Saido T.C. Oyama F.

However, although the fluxes of weakly bound synaptic Cu2+ are thought to reach levels of 15–200 μm (38.Hartter D.E. Barnea A.

We wondered whether the concentration of Cu2+ in plaques might in part be due to Cu2+ binding to Aβ(11–40/42)with an even tighter affinity. Interestingly, this truncated Aβ(11–40/42) contains a histidine (His-13) two amino acids from the N-terminal amino group. This bears a striking resemblance to the Cu2+ binding motif (NH2-XXH) at the N terminus of human serum albumin (HSA) (40.Glennon J.D. Sarkar B.

We show for the first time that Aβ(11–40/42) has heightened amyloidogenicity compared with Aβ(1–40/42) and forms short amyloid rod-shaped assemblies. Furthermore, we show Cu2+ has an extremely tight, 34 ± 5 fm dissociation constant for Aβ(11–40) at pH 7.4 and has a marked influence on Aβ(11–40) fiber formation and morphology. Aβ(11–40/42) constitutes 19% of the plaque load, and this work suggests that it is responsible for the high concentration of Cu2+ found in the plaques of AD patients. Peptides used were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) deprotection chemistry, including Aβ(1–40) (DAEFR HDSGY EVHHQ KLVFF AEDVG SNKGA IIGLM VGGVV), Aβ(11–40) (EVHHQ KLVFF AEDVG SNKGA IIGLM VGGVV), and Aβ(11–42) (EVHHQ KLVFF AEDVG SNKGA IIGLM VGGVV IA). These peptides, found in the CSF and plaques, include a free N-terminal amino group and C-terminal carboxylate. Pentapeptide models of the Cu2+ binding motif were C-terminally amidated to mimic the continuation of the peptide sequence in full-length Aβ(11–40/42). The peptides were removed from the resin and deprotected before being purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The samples were characterized using mass spectrometry. Peptides with amidated C termini and free N-terminal amino groups studied included NH2-EVHHQ-CONH2 and NH2-EVHAQ-CONH2. Pentapeptides were purchased from Generon Ltd. (Maidenhead, UK). Full-length Aβ(11–40), Aβ(11–42), and Aβ(1–40) purchased from EZ Biolabs (Carmel, IN) and Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Billingham, UK). All three Aβ peptides, Aβ(1–40), Aβ(11–40),and Aβ(11–42), were solubilized at a concentration of 100 μm in water at pH 10.5–11 and then left at 4 °C for 48–72 h. In our hands we found that this was the most effective solubilization method, as others have reported (47.Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M. Harper J.D. Khurana R. Walsh D.M. Condron M.M. Selkoe D.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Fink A.L. Teplow D.B.

Preparation of amyloid β-protein for structural and functional studies.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is clear that solubilized preparations of Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(11–40) are largely seed-free at pH 7.4, as solubilized preparations typically have no thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence at time 0 and exhibit a distinctive lag phase of >20 h for Aβ(11–40) and 60 h for Aβ(1–40). Freshly solubilized Aβ(11–40) and Aβ(1–40) peptides had no detectable assemblies under TEM. For Aβ(1–40), the concentration was determined using tyrosine absorption at 280-nm ϵ280 = 1280 cm−1m−1. Aβ(11–40) and Aβ(11–42) lack a tyrosine residue so the peptide absorbance at 214-nm ϵ214 = 923 cm−1m−1 per amide was used (49.Kuipers B.J. Gruppen H. Prediction of molar extinction coefficients of proteins and peptides using UV absorption of the constituent amino acids at 214 nm to enable quantitative reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2007; 55: 5445-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). All lyophilized peptides typically contained 10–20% moisture by weight. Concentrations for Aβ(11–40/42) were supported by the 1:1 saturation of the Cu2+ binding site, indicating that a very clear 1:1 stoichiometry had been established for freshly solubilized Aβ(11–40/42). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma at the highest purity available, and ultra high quality water was used throughout (resistivity of 10−18 ohm−1 cm−1). Small aliquots of fresh aqueous stock solutions, typically 10 mm, were used to add metal ions (CuCl2·2H2O, NiCl2·6H2O) and competitive ligands, glycine (500 mm) and l-histidine (50 mm), stocks for titrations. Titrations were conducted at pH 7.4 with adjustments made using 20–100 mm solutions of NaOH and HCl. pH measurements were made before and after spectroscopic measurements. The conditional affinities at pH 7.4 were determined using glycine and l-histidine as competing ligands. The range of competitor concentrations (glycine and histidine) with Cu2+-Aβ(11–40) or Cu2+-Aβ(11–15) (0.8:1.0) complexes were made up in advance and left for 12 h at pH 7.4 to ensure equilibrium had been reached. Repeat CD spectra were obtained over a few hours to confirm equilibrium had been reached. The concentration of competitor required for equal molar equivalents of Cu2+ to be bound to both the Aβ peptide and competitor was used to determine the affinity of Cu2+ for the Aβ peptide using Equation 1 (35.Sarell C.J.

Ka1 and Ka2 at pH 7.4 are 7.4 × 105 m−1 and 7.4 × 104 m−1 for Gly and 2.7 × 108 m−1 and 2.1 × 106 m−1 for His (51.Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research.

The kinetics of amyloid fiber formation were monitored using binding of ThT to amyloid fibers, which induces ThT to fluoresce at 487 nm; this signal is proportional to the amount of amyloid fibrils present (52.Younan N.D. Viles J.H. A comparison of three fluorophores for the detection of amyloid fibers and prefibrillar oligomeric assemblies: ThT (Thioflavin T), ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid), and bisANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid).Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). BMG-Galaxy and Omega FLUOstar fluorescence 96-well plate readers were used for the measuring of ThT fluorescence. Fluorescence readings were typically taken every 30 min after 30 s of gentle agitation. Fluorescence excitation and emission detection were obtained using filters at 440 nm and 490 nm, respectively. Fiber growth kinetics are sensitive to a number of factors, including pH, concentration of Aβ, agitation, ionic strength, and temperature; consequently, measures were taken to reduce variance in these parameters. All Aβ peptides were studied at 10 μm, and all fiber growth experiments were incubated at 30 °C in 30 mm HEPES buffer (due to its low affinity for Cu2+ ions) and 160 mm NaCl. The pH, a critical factor in rate of fiber growth, was adjusted to pH 7.4 if necessary with small additions of 20–100 mm NaOH and HCl. Variation between samples was measured to be 0.05 pH units or less. 10 μm ThT was present (1:1 with Aβ), which is optimal for tracking Aβ amyloid growth (52.Younan N.D. Viles J.H. A comparison of three fluorophores for the detection of amyloid fibers and prefibrillar oligomeric assemblies: ThT (Thioflavin T), ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid), and bisANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid).Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Conversion of essentially monomeric Aβ to amyloid fibers follows a characteristic growth curve consisting of an initial lag-phase (nucleation) before a growth phase (elongation). A growth curve can be fitted to the data to obtain a number of empirical parameters using the following equation (53.Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L.

Initial fluorescence intensity is represented by vi, vf represents the final fluorescence intensity, and x0 is the time at which half-maximal fluorescence is reached (t50). The conditional fiber growth rate (kapp) is obtained by 1/τ and the lag-time (tlag) by x0 − 2τ. Data were processed using KaleidaGraph 4.0. Typically six or more kinetic traces were used to extract kinetic parameters. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C on an Applied Photophysics Chirascan instrument between 250 and 700 nm with sampling points every 2 nm using a 1-cm path length. Three repeat scans were made, and baseline spectra were subtracted from each spectra followed by smoothing using a 5-nm window if required. Data were processed using Applied Photophysics Chirascan Viewer, Microsoft Excel, and KaleidaGraph spreadsheet/graph package. CD ellipticity measurements (θ, millidegrees) were converted to Δϵ (molar CD, m−1 cm−1) using the relationship Δϵ = θ/(33000.cl), where c is the molar concentration, and l is the path length.

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in applying human bio-signals, particularly eye movements, to recognize the emotional gist of a scene such as its valence. In order to determine the emotional category of images using eye movements, the existing methods often learn a classifier using several features that are extracted from eye movements. Although it has been shown that eye movement is potentially useful for recognition of scene valence, the contribution of each feature is not well-studied. To address the issue, we study the contribution of features extracted from eye movements in the classification of images into pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant categories. We assess ten features and their fusion. The features are histogram of saccade orientation, histogram of saccade slope, histogram of saccade length, histogram of saccade duration, histogram of saccade velocity, histogram of fixation duration, fixation histogram, top-ten salient coordinates, and saliency map. We utilize machine learning approach to analyze the performance of features by learning a support vector machine and exploiting various feature fusion schemes. The experiments reveal that ‘saliency map’, ‘fixation histogram’, ‘histogram of fixation duration’, and ‘histogram of saccade slope’ are the most contributing features. The selected features signify the influence of fixation information and angular behavior of eye movements in the recognition of the valence of images."

In the present study, a total of 64 actinomycetes were isolated from 12 different marine sponge species that had been collected offshore the islands of Milos and Crete, Greece, eastern Mediterranean. The isolates were affiliated to 23 genera representing 8 different suborders based on nearly full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four putatively novel species belonging to genera Geodermatophilus, Microlunatus, Rhodococcus and Actinomycetospora were identified based on a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of < 98.5% to currently described strains. Eight actinomycete isolates showed bioactivities against Trypanosma brucei brucei TC221 with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values <20 μg/mL. Thirty four isolates from the Milos collection and 12 isolates from the Crete collection were subjected to metabolomic analysis using high resolution LC-MS and NMR for dereplication purposes. Two isolates belonging to the genera Streptomyces (SBT348) and Micromonospora (SBT687) were prioritized based on their distinct chemistry profiles as well as their anti-trypanosomal activities. These findings demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing metabolomics tools to prioritize chemically unique strains from microorganism collections and further highlight sponges as rich source for novel and bioactive actinomycetes."

Data were gathered from 118 venues through direct observations and interviews with staff. A score sheet-based welfare assessment was used to calculate scores between 1 and 10, indicating each venue's welfare situation. Factors such as freedom of movement for the animals, access to veterinary care, environmental noise quality, hygiene standards and work intensity were included in the score sheet. 1688 elephants, 371 macaques and 621 tigers were found at the venues. 89 venues exclusively kept elephants, 9 designated 'Monkey schools' offered macaque shows, 4 venues kept primarily tigers, mostly for petting and photo opportunities, and the remaining venues kept a mix of these animals. A strong imbalance in female to male gender ratios was recorded with about 4:1 for adult elephants and 1:4 for adult macaques. Severely inadequate welfare conditions were common, with 75% of macaques and 99% of tigers being kept at venues with scores less than 5. 86% of elephants were kept in inadequate conditions at venues with scores between 3 and 5, but a significant number of venues with scores above 5 were found. 4.6% of elephants were provided commendable conditions, reaching assessment scores of 8 and above. 71% of venues did not offer any sort of education about animals to visitors. This study is the first to assess welfare aspects of captive wild animals at tourism venues across Thailand. It concludes that significant concerns exist about the welfare of wild animals in the tourism sector of Thailand. Urgent attention needs to be given to address these concerns and prevent further suffering. But also to ensure the demand for wild animals doesn't have a negative impact on wild populations."
https://openalex.org/W2276515708,"The increased expression of the Disintegrin and Metalloprotease ADAM12 has been associated with human cancers, however its role remain unclear. We have previously reported that ADAM12 expression is induced by the transforming growth factor, TGF-β and promotes TGF-β-dependent signaling through interaction with the type II receptor of TGF-β. Here we explore the implication of ADAM12 in TGF-β-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in cancer progression. We show that ADAM12 expression is correlated with EMT markers in human breast cancer cell lines and biopsies. Using a non-malignant breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A), we demonstrate that TGF-β-induced EMT increases expression of the membrane-anchored ADAM12L long form. Importantly, ADAM12L overexpression in MCF10A is sufficient to induce loss of cell-cell contact, reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, up-regulation of EMT markers and chemoresistance. These effects are independent of the proteolytic activity but require the cytoplasmic tail and are specific of ADAM12L since overexpression of ADAM12S failed to induce similar changes. We further demonstrate that ADAM12L-dependent EMT is associated with increased phosphorylation of Smad3, Akt and ERK proteins. Conversely, inhibition of TGF-β receptors or ERK activities reverses ADAM12L-induced mesenchymal phenotype. Together our data demonstrate that ADAM12L is associated with EMT and contributes to TGF-β-dependent EMT by favoring both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1741334344,"Typhoons can cause strong disturbance, mixing, and upwelling in the upper layer of the oceans. Rich nutrients from the subsurface layer can be brought to the euphotic layer, which will induce the phytoplankton to breed and grow rapidly. In this paper, we investigate the impact of an intense and fast moving tropical storm, Typhoon Matsa, on phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration off East China. By using satellite remote sensing data, we analyze the changes of Chl-a concentration, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and wind speed in the pre- and post-typhoon periods. We also give a preliminary discussion on the different responses of the Chl-a concentration between nearshore and offshore waters. In nearshore/coastal regions where nutrients are generally rich, the Chl-a maximum occurs usually at the surface or at the layer close to the surface. And, in offshore tropical oligotrophic oceans, the subsurface maxima of Chl-a exist usually in the stratified water column. In an offshore area east of Taiwan, the Chl-a concentration rose gradually in about two weeks after the typhoon. However, in a coastal area north of Taiwan high Chl-a concentration decreased sharply before landfall, rebounded quickly to some degree after landfall, and restored gradually to the pre-typhoon level in about two weeks. The Chl-a concentration presented a negative correlation with the wind speed in the nearshore area during the typhoon, which is opposite to the response in the offshore waters. The phenomena may be attributable to onshore advection of low Chl-a water, coastal downwelling and intensified mixing, which together bring pre-typhoon surface Chl-a downward in the coastal area. In the offshore area, the typhoon may trigger increase of Chl-a concentration through uptake of nutrients by typhoon-induced upwelling and entrainment mixing."
https://openalex.org/W2183035429,"A common complication in patients with incontinence is perineal skin lesions, which are recognized as a form of dermatitis. In these patients, perineal skin is exposed to digestive enzymes and intestinal bacterial flora, as well as excessive water. The relative contributions of digestive enzymes and intestinal bacterial flora to skin lesion formation have not been fully shown. This study was conducted to reveal the process of histopathological changes caused by proteases and bacterial inoculation in skin maceration. For skin maceration, agarose gel containing proteases was applied to the dorsal skin of male Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 h, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa inoculation for 30 min. Macroscopic changes, histological changes, bacterial distribution, inflammatory response, and keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation were examined. Proteases induced digestion in the prickle cell layer of the epidermis, and slight bleeding in the papillary dermis and around hair follicles in the macerated skin without macroscopic evidence of erosion. Bacterial inoculation of the skin macerated by proteolytic solution resulted in the formation of bacteria-rich clusters comprising numerous microorganisms and inflammatory cells within the papillary dermis, with remarkable tissue damage around the clusters. Tissue damage expanded by day 2. On day 3, the proliferative keratinocyte layer was elongated from the bulge region of the hair follicles. Application of proteases and P. aeruginosa induced skin lesion formation internally without macroscopic erosion of the overhydrated area, suggesting that the histopathology might be different from regular dermatitis. The healing process of this lesion is similar to transepidermal elimination."

Measuring the cytokine responses may be useful to identify novel markers for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating pneumonia. Objective To describe and compare a wide range of inflammatory mediators in plasma from children with WHO-defined severe and non-severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP), and explore to what extent certain mediators are associated with severity and viral detection. Methods We collected blood samples from 430 children with severe (n = 43) and non-severe (n = 387) CAP. Plasma from these children were analysed for 27 different cytokines, and we measured the association with age, disease severity and viral detection. Results There were generally higher plasma concentrations of several cytokines with both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects among children with severe CAP than in children with non-severe CAP. We found significantly higher concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-15, eotaxin, basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the group of severe CAP. Most of these associations persisted when adjusting for age in linear regression analyses. The cytokine response was strongly associated with age but to a lesser extent with viral etiology. Conclusion The plasma concentrations of several cytokines, both with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, were higher among children with severe illness. In particular G-CSF and IL-6 reflected severity and might provide complementary information on the severity of the infection. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00148733"
https://openalex.org/W1721266621,"Together with mesangial cells, glomerular endothelial cells and the basement membrane, podocytes constitute the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) of the kidney. Podocytes play a pivotal role in the progression of various kidney-related diseases such as glomerular sclerosis and glomerulonephritis that finally lead to chronic end-stage renal disease. During podocytopathies, the slit-diaphragm connecting the adjacent podocytes are detached leading to severe loss of proteins in the urine. The pathophysiology of podocytopathies makes podocytes a potential and challenging target for nanomedicine development, though there is a lack of known molecular targets for cell selective drug delivery. To identify VCAM-1 as a cell-surface receptor that is suitable for binding and internalization of nanomedicine carrier systems by podocytes, we investigated its expression in the immortalized podocyte cell lines AB8/13 and MPC-5, and in primary podocytes. Gene and protein expression analyses revealed that VCAM-1 expression is increased by podocytes upon TNFα-activation for up to 24 h. This was paralleled by anti-VCAM-1 antibody binding to the TNFα-activated cells, which can be employed as a ligand to facilitate the uptake of nanocarriers under inflammatory conditions. Hence, we next explored the possibilities of using VCAM-1 as a cell-surface receptor to deliver the potent immunosuppressant rapamycin to TNFα-activated podocytes using the lipid-based nanocarrier system Saint-O-Somes. Anti-VCAM-1-rapamycin-SAINT-O-Somes more effectively inhibited the cell migration of AB8/13 cells than free rapamycin and non-targeted rapamycin-SAINT-O-Somes indicating the potential of VCAM-1 targeted drug delivery to podocytes."

To study objectives 1) and 2) all ADL-independent participants at baseline (N = 307) were included; for objective 3) all participants 78 years and older were included (N = 316). Data were collected at baseline and at 3- and 6-year follow-ups. ADL-disability was defined as a need for assistance in one or more activities. Informal and formal care were measured using the Resource utilization in Dementia (RUD)-instrument.The incidence rates for men were similar in the age groups 78-81 and 84 years and older, 42.3 vs. 42.5/1000 person-years. For women the incidence rate for ADL-disability increased significantly from the age group 78-81 to the age group 84 years and older, 20.8 vs.118.3/1000 person-years. In the age group 78-81 years, being physically active earlier (aOR 6.2) and during the past 12 month (aOR 2.9) were both significant preventive factors for ADL-disability. Both informal and formal care increased with ADL-disability and the amount of informal care was greater than formal care. The incidence rate for ADL-disability increases with age for women and being physically active is a protective factor for ADL-disability.The incidence rate for ADL-disability increases with age for women, and being physical active is a protective factor for ADL-disability."
https://openalex.org/W1800746630,"Background Quercus oleoides Cham. and Schlect., tropical live oak, is a species of conservation importance in its southern range limit of northwestern Costa Rica. It occurs in high-density stands across a fragmented landscape spanning a contrasting elevation and precipitation gradient. We examined genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure in this geographically isolated and genetically distinct population. We characterized population genetic diversity at 11 nuclear microsatellite loci in 260 individuals from 13 sites. We monitored flowering time at 10 sites, and characterized the local environment in order to compare observed spatial genetic structure to hypotheses of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-environment. Finally, we quantified pollen dispersal distances and tested for local adaptation through a reciprocal transplant experiment in order to experimentally address these hypotheses. Results High genetic diversity is maintained in the population and the genetic variation is significantly structured among sampled sites. We identified 5 distinct genetic clusters and average pollen dispersal predominately occurred over short distances. Differences among sites in flowering phenology and environmental factors, however, were not strictly associated with genetic differentiation. Growth and survival of upland and lowland progeny in their native and foreign environments was expected to exhibit evidence of local adaptation due to the more extreme dry season in the lowlands. Seedlings planted in the lowland garden experienced much higher mortality than seedlings in the upland garden, but we did not identify evidence for local adaptation. Conclusion Overall, this study indicates that the Costa Rican Q. oleoides population has a rich population genetic history. Despite environmental heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation, isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-environment alone do not explain spatial genetic structure. These results add to studies of genetic structure by examining a common, tropical tree over multiple habitats and provide information for managers of a successional forest in a protected area."
https://openalex.org/W2191472653,"A procentriole is assembled next to the mother centriole during S phase and remains associated until M phase. After functioning as a spindle pole during mitosis, the mother centriole and procentriole are separated at the end of mitosis. A close association of the centriole pair is regarded as an intrinsic block to the centriole reduplication. Therefore, deregulation of this process may cause a problem in the centriole number control, resulting in increased genomic instability. Despite its importance for faithful centriole duplication, the mechanism of centriole separation is not fully understood yet. Here, we report that centriole pairs are prematurely separated in cells whose cell cycle is arrested at M phase by STLC. Dispersal of the pericentriolar material (PCM) was accompanied. This phenomenon was independent of the separase activity but needed the PLK1 activity. Nocodazole effectively inhibited centriole scattering in STLC-treated cells, possibly by reducing the microtubule pulling force around centrosomes. Inhibition of PLK1 also reduced the premature separation of centrioles and the PCM dispersal as well. These results revealed the importance of PCM integrity in centriole association. Therefore, we propose that PCM disassembly is one of the driving forces for centriole separation during mitotic exit."

For both THREE (r = 0.71, P<0.01) and TEN (r = 0.64, P<0.01), a significant bivariate correlation was found between W' and tlim.W>CP and tlim can be greater than predicted by the P-tlim relationship when a decrement in the work rate of high-volatility is applied. Exercise tolerance can be enhanced through a change in work rate within the severe intensity domain. W>CP is not constant."

To examine these long term effects, we created inducible, single-copy cell lines that expressed aggregation-prone polyglutamine proteins over several months. We present evidence that, as perinuclear aggresomes accumulate, they are associated with abnormal nuclear morphology and DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in cell cycle arrest via the phosphorylated p53 (Ser-15)-dependent pathway. Further analysis reveals that aggresomes can have a detrimental effect on mitosis by steric interference with chromosome alignment, centrosome positioning, and spindle formation. The incidence of apoptosis also increased in aggresome-containing cells. These severe defects developed gradually after juxtanuclear aggresome formation and were not associated with small cytoplasmic aggregates alone. Thus, our findings demonstrate that, in dividing cells, aggresomes are detrimental over the long term, rather than protective. This suggests a novel mechanism for polyglutamine-associated developmental and cell biological abnormalities, particularly those with early onset and non-neuronal pathologies.

These changes have been shown to alter receptor activation of certain Gi-and Gq-coupled GPCRs.

https://openalex.org/W2231621831,"Class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are composed of p110 catalytic and p85 regulatory subunits. How regulatory subunits modulate PI3K activity remains only partially understood. Here we identified SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) as a new player modulating this regulation. We demonstrate that both p85β and p85α are conjugated to SUMO1 and SUMO2. We identified two lysine residues located at the inter-SH2 domain on p85β, a critical region required for inhibition of p110, as being required for SUMO conjugation. A SUMOylation-defective mutant p85β shows higher activation of the PI3K pathway, and increased cell migration and transformation. Moreover, the cancer-related KS459del mutant in p85α was less efficiently SUMOylated compared with the wild-type protein. Finally, our results show that SUMO modulates p85 tyrosine phosphorylation, a modification correlating with PI3K pathway activation. Thus, SUMO reduces the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated-p85 while loss of SUMOylation results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. In summary, we identify SUMO as a new important player in the regulation of the PI3K pathway through modulation of p85."

Here, we engineered an anti-human DCIR recombinant antibody, which cross-reacts with the homologous cynomolgous macaque receptor and was fused via the heavy chain C-terminus to HIV Gagp24 protein (αDCIR.Gagp24). In vitro, αDCIR.Gagp24 expanded multifunctional antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cells recognizing multiple Gagp24 peptides from HIV-infected patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In non human primates, priming with αDCIR.Gagp24 without adjuvant elicited a strong anti-Gagp24 antibody response after the second immunization, while in the non-targeted HIV Gagp24 protein control groups the titers were weak. The presence of the double-stranded RNA poly(I:C) adjuvant significantly enhanced the anti-Gagp24 antibody response in all the groups and reduced the discrimination between the different vaccine groups. The avidity of the anti-Gagp24 antibody responses was similar with either αDCIR.Gagp24 or Gagp24 immunization, but increased from medium to high avidity in both groups when poly(I:C) was co-administered. This data provides a comparative analysis of DC-targeted and non-targeted proteins for their capacity to induce antigen-specific antibody responses in vivo. This study supports the further development of DCIR-based DC-targeting vaccines for protective durable antibody induction, especially in the absence of adjuvant."
https://openalex.org/W2201972449,"Neurons in the cerebral cortex stratify on the basis of their time of origin, axonal terminations and the molecular identities assigned during early development. Olfactory cortices share many feature with the neocortex, including clear lamination and similar cell types. The present study demonstrates that the markers differentially expressed in the projection neurons of the cerebral cortex are also found in olfactory areas. Three of the four regions examined (pars principalis of the anterior olfactory nucleus: AONpP, anterior and posterior piriform cortices: APC, PPC, and the olfactory tubercle) expressed transcription factors found in deep or superficial neurons in the developing neocortex, though large differences were found between areas. For example, while the AONpP, APC and PPC all broadly expressed the deep cortical marker CTIP2, NOR1 (NR4a3) levels were higher in AONpP and DAARP-32 was more prevalent in the APC and PPC. Similar findings were encountered for superficial cortical markers: all three regions broadly expressed CUX1, but CART was only observed in the APC and PPC. Furthermore, regional variations were observed even within single structures (e.g., NOR1 was found primarily in in the dorsal region of AONpP and CART expression was observed in a discrete band in the middle of layer 2 of both the APC and PPC). Experiments using the mitotic marker EDU verified that the olfactory cortices and neocortex share similar patterns of neuronal production: olfactory cells that express markers found in the deep neocortex are produced earlier than those that express superficial makers. Projection neurons were filled by retrograde tracers injected into the olfactory bulb to see if olfactory neurons with deep and superficial markers had different axonal targets. Unlike the cerebral cortex, no specificity was observed: neurons with each of the transcription factors examined were found to be labelled. Together the results indicate that olfactory cortices are complex: they differ from each other and each is formed from a variable mosaic of neurons. The results suggest that the olfactory cortices are not merely a remnant architype of the primordial forebrain but varied and independent regions."

We hypothesized that because of its relevance to intergroup conflict, incidental anger exacerbates the political polarization effects of issue partisanship (the correlation between partisan identification and partisan attitudes), and, separately, the correlation between conservative partisan identification and perceived polarization between Democrats and Republicans. We further hypothesized that these effects would be strongest for Republican identification because Republican leaders were targets of public criticism in both tragedies and because conservative (Republican) ideology tends to be more sensitive to threat. In the studies, participants first completed an emotion induction procedure by recalling autobiographical events that made them angry (Studies 1 & 2), sad (Studies 1 & 2), or that involved recalling emotionally neutral events (Study 2). Participants later reported their attitudes regarding the two tragedies, their perceptions of the typical Democrat's and Republican's attitudes on those issues, and their identification with the Democratic and Republican parties. Compared with incidental sadness (Studies 1 and 2) and a neutral condition (Study 2), incidental anger exacerbated the associations between Republican identification and partisan attitudes, and, separately between Republican identification and perceived polarization between the attitudes of Democrats and Republicans.

The aims of this study were to determine the effect of normal pregnancy on postpartum parameters of the electrocardiogram, and furthermore to determine how a history of pre-eclampsia may affect these parameters. Ten-minute high-resolution (1000 Hz) orthogonal Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were used to measure heart rate variability (HRV). Signal-averaged P-wave and QRS complex durations were determined. Participants included non-pregnant controls, normotensive parous controls and women with a recent history of PE. While reductions in HRV induced by uncomplicated pregnancy returned to non-pregnant levels by 6-8 months postpartum HRV remained reduced in women with a history of PE compared to control groups. In addition, P-Wave and QRS complex durations were prolonged in PE subjects at 6-8 months postpartum compared to control groups. Only QRS duration was independent of differences in blood pressure. These results suggest increased sympathetic cardiac activity, and delayed myocardial conduction in women after PE; alterations consistent with cardiac remodeling and increased risk for arrhythmia. In examining the association between PE and cardiovascular disease, identification of ECG abnormalities soon after pregnancy in women with a history of PE highlights a unique opportunity for early identification and screening in this population before other risk factors become apparent."
https://openalex.org/W2199603535,"Background/Aim Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity is related to the formation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is detoxified through conjugation with reduced glutathione (GSH). Ophthalmic acid (OA) is an analogue of GSH in which cysteine is replaced with 2-aminobutyrate. Metabolomics studies of mice with APAP-induced acute liver failure (APAP-ALF) identified OA as a marker of oxidative stress and hepatic GSH consumption. The aim of the current study was to determine whether OA is detectable in APAP-ALF human patients either early (day 2) or late (day 4) and whether OA levels were associated with in-hospital survival in the absence of liver transplant. Methods Serum samples from 130 APAP-ALF patients (82 survivors, 48 non-survivors) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and correlated with clinical data from the United States Acute Liver Failure Study Group (US ALFSG) Registry (2004–2011). Results Survivors had significantly lower admission bilirubin (4.2 vs. 5.7 mg/dl) and lactate levels (3.3 vs. 6.5 μmol/l, p<0.05 for all). During the first 7 days of the study, survivors were less likely to require mechanical ventilation (55% vs. 88%), vasopressor support (9.8% vs. 67%) or renal replacement therapy (26% vs. 63%, p< 0.001 for all). Non-survivors were more likely to have detectable OA levels early (31% vs. 15%, p = 0.034) and late (27% vs. 11%, p = 0.02). However there were no significant differences in mean OA levels between non-survivors and survivors (early 0.48 vs. 0.36, late 0.43 vs. 0.37, P > 0.5 for all). Conclusion OA was detectable more frequently in APAP-ALF non-survivors but mean OA levels were not associated with survival. The routine clinical administration of N-acetyl cysteine could replenish GSH levels and prevent OA production."
https://openalex.org/W2191072568,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pleiotropic cells with potential therapeutic benefits for a wide range of diseases. Because of their immunomodulatory properties they have been utilized to treat autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), which is characterized by demyelination. The microenvironment surrounding MSCs is thought to affect their differentiation and phenotype, which could in turn affect the efficacy. We thus sought to dissect the potential for differential impact of MSCs on central nervous system (CNS) disease in T cell mediated and non-T cell mediated settings using the MOG35-55 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone-mediated demyelination models, respectively. As the pathogeneses of MS and EAE are thought to be mediated by IFNγ-producing (TH1) and IL-17A-producing (TH17) effector CD4+ T cells, we investigated the effect of MSCs on the development of these two key pathogenic cell groups. Although MSCs suppressed the activation and effector function of TH17 cells, they did not affect TH1 activation, but enhanced TH1 effector function and ultimately produced no effect on EAE. In the non- T cell mediated cuprizone model of demyelination, MSC administration had a positive effect, with an overall increase in myelin abundance in the brain of MSC-treated mice compared to controls. These results highlight the potential variability of MSCs as a biologic therapeutic tool in the treatment of autoimmune disease and the need for further investigation into the multifaceted functions of MSCs in diverse microenvironments and the mechanisms behind the diversity."

The general significance of such transient dynamics for brain function is unclear; however, for instance decision-making processes in perception and cognition have been implicated with it. The network under study here is comprised of three subnetworks of either excitatory or inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, of which two are of the same type. The synaptic weights are arranged to establish and maintain a balance between excitation and inhibition in case of a constant external drive. Each subnetwork is randomly connected, where all neurons belonging to a particular population have the same in-degree and the same out-degree. Neurons in different subnetworks are also randomly connected with the same probability; however, depending on the type of the pre-synaptic neuron, the synaptic weight is scaled by a factor. We observed that for a certain range of the “within” versus “between” connection weights (bifurcation parameter), the network activation spontaneously switches between the two sub-networks of the same type. This kind of dynamics has been termed “winnerless competition”, which also has a random component here. In our model, this phenomenon is well described by a set of coupled stochastic differential equations of Lotka-Volterra type that imply a competition between the subnetworks. The associated mean-field model shows the same dynamical behavior as observed in simulations of large networks comprising thousands of spiking neurons. The deterministic phase portrait is characterized by two attractors and a saddle node, its stochastic component is essentially given by the multiplicative inherent noise of the system. We find that the dwell time distribution of the active states is exponential, indicating that the noise drives the system randomly from one attractor to the other. A similar model for a larger number of populations might suggest a general approach to study the dynamics of interacting populations of spiking networks."

Sprinklers and showerheads are known to support the development of microbial biofilms, which can be a source of infection by pathogenic microorganisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of microbial biofilms in dairy cooling systems, and to analyze their population compositions using culture-independent technique, 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Biofilm samples were collected on eight dairy farms from 40 sprinklers and the microbial constituents were identified by deep sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 9,374 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was obtained from all samples. The mean richness of the samples was 465 ± 268 OTUs which were classified into 26 different phyla; 76% of the reads belonged to only three phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Although the most prevalent OTUs (Paracoccus, Methyloversatilis, Brevundimonas, Porphyrobacter, Gp4, Mycobacterium, Hyphomicrobium, Corynebacterium and Clostridium) were shared by all farms, each farm formed a unique microbial pattern. Some known potential human and livestock pathogens were found to be closely related to the OTUs found in this study. This work demonstrates the presence of biofilm in dairy cooling systems which may potentially serve as a live source for microbial pathogens."

Therefore, boosting endogenous repair mechanisms would be a useful therapeutic approach for neurological disorders. Isoxazole-9 (Isx-9) has been reported to enhance neurogenesis from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). However, the effects of Isx-9 on other types of progenitor/precursor cells remain mostly unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of Isx-9 on the three major populations of progenitor/precursor cells in brain: NSPCs, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Cultured primary NSPCs, OPCs, or EPCs were treated with various concentrations of Isx-9 (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 μM), and their cell numbers were counted in a blinded manner. Isx-9 slightly increased the number of NSPCs and effectively induced neuronal differentiation of NSPCs. However, Isx-9 significantly decreased OPC number in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting cytotoxicity. Isx-9 did not affect EPC cell number. But in a matrigel assay of angiogenesis, Isx-9 significantly inhibited tube formation in outgrowth endothelial cells derived from EPCs. This potential anti-tube-formation effect of Isx-9 was confirmed in a brain endothelial cell line. Taken together, our data suggest that mechanisms and targets for promoting stem/progenitor cells in the central nervous system may significantly differ between cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1539537407,"Surgical safety during vacation periods may be influenced by the interplay of several factors, including workers' leave, hospital activity, climate, and the variety of patient cases. This study aimed to highlight an annually recurring peak of surgical mortality during summer in France and explore its main predictors. We selected all elective of open surgical procedures performed in French hospitals between 2007 and 2012. Surgical mortality variation was analyzed over time in relation to workers leaving on vacation, the volume of procedures performed by hospitals, and temperature changes. We ran a multilevel logistic regression for exploring the determinants of surgical mortality, taking into account the clustering of patients within hospitals and adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. A total of 609 French hospitals had 8,926,120 discharges related to open elective surgery. During 6 years, we found a recurring mortality peak of 1.15% (95% CI 1.09-1.20) in August compared with 0.81% (0.79-0.82, p<.001) in other months. The incidence of worker vacation was 43.0% (38.9-47.2) in August compared with 7.3% (4.6-10.1, p<.001) in other months. Hospital activity decreased substantially in August (78,126 inpatient stays, 75,298-80,954) in relation to other months (128,142, 125,697-130,586, p<.001). After adjusting for all covariates, we found an ""August effect"" reflecting a higher risk to patients undergoing operations at this time (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.12-1.19, p<.001). The main study limitation was the absence of data linkage between surgical staffing and mortality at the hospital level. The observed, recurring mortality peak in August raises questions about how to maintain hospital activity and optimal staffing through better regulation of human activities."
https://openalex.org/W2110013799,"Adenovirus infections are important complications of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We demonstrate delayed clearance of mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) from lungs of mice following allogeneic BMT. Virus-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was greater in BMT mice than in untransplanted controls, but BMT using PGE2-deficient donors or recipients failed to improve viral clearance, and treatment of untransplanted mice with the PGE2 analog misoprostol did not affect virus clearance. Lymphocyte recruitment to the lungs was not significantly affected by BMT. Intracellular cytokine staining of lung lymphocytes demonstrated impaired production of INF-γ and granzyme B by cells from BMT mice, and production of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17 following ex vivo stimulation was impaired in lymphocytes obtained from lungs of BMT mice. Viral clearance was not delayed in untransplanted INF-γ-deficient mice, suggesting that delayed viral clearance in BMT mice was not a direct consequence of impaired IFN-γ production. However, lung viral loads were higher in untransplanted CD8-deficient mice than in controls, suggesting that delayed MAV-1 clearance in BMT mice is due to defective CD8 T cell function. We did not detect significant induction of IFN-β expression in lungs of BMT mice or untransplanted controls, and viral clearance was not delayed in untransplanted type I IFN-unresponsive mice. We conclude that PGE2 overproduction in BMT mice is not directly responsible for delayed viral clearance. PGE2-independent effects on CD8 T cell function likely contribute to the inability of BMT mice to clear MAV-1 from the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2194980398,"The munc18-1 gene encodes two splice-variants that vary at the C-terminus of the protein and are expressed at different levels in different regions of the adult mammalian brain. Here, we investigated the expression pattern of these splice variants within the brainstem and tested whether they are functionally different. Munc18-1a is expressed in specific nuclei of the brainstem including the LRN, VII and SOC, while Munc18-1b expression is relatively low/absent in these regions. Furthermore, Munc18-1a is the major splice variant in the Calyx of Held. Synaptic transmission was analyzed in autaptic hippocampal munc18-1 KO neurons re-expressing either Munc18-1a or Munc18-1b. The two splice variants supported synaptic transmission to a similar extent, but Munc18-1b was slightly more potent in sustaining synchronous release during high frequency stimulation. Our data suggest that alternative splicing of Munc18-1 support synaptic transmission to a similar extent, but could modulate presynaptic short-term plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2227804297,"Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase that has been associated with neurodegeneration and cancer. SIRT2 is composed of a central catalytic domain, the structure of which has been solved, and N- and C-terminal extensions that are thought to control SIRT2 function. However structural information of these N- and C-terminal regions is missing. Here, we provide the first full-length molecular models of SIRT2 in the absence and presence of NAD+. We also predict the structural alterations associated with phosphorylation of SIRT2 at S331, a modification that inhibits catalytic activity. Bioinformatics tools and molecular dynamics simulations, complemented by in vitro deacetylation assays, provide a consistent picture based on which the C-terminal region of SIRT2 is suggested to function as an autoinhibitory region. This has the capacity to partially occlude the NAD+ binding pocket or stabilize the NAD+ in a non-productive state. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that the phosphorylation at S331 causes large conformational changes in the C-terminal region that enhance the autoinhibitory activity, consistent with our previous findings that phosphorylation of S331 by cyclin-dependent kinases inhibits SIRT2 catalytic activity. The molecular insight into the role of the C-terminal region in controlling SIRT2 function described in this study may be useful for future design of selective inhibitors targeting SIRT2 for therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2238999137,"Low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) play an important role in determining dough properties and breadmaking quality. However, resolution of the currently used methodologies for analyzing LMW-GS is rather low which prevents an efficient use of genetic variations associated with these alleles in wheat breeding. The aim of the current study is to evaluate and develop a rapid, simple, and accurate method to differentiate LMW-GS alleles using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A set of standard single LMW-GS allele lines as well as a suite of well documented wheat cultivars were collected from France, CIMMYT, and Canada. Method development and optimization were focused on protein extraction procedures and MALDI-TOF instrument settings to generate reproducible diagnostic spectrum peak profiles for each of the known wheat LMW-GS allele. Results revealed a total of 48 unique allele combinations among the studied genotypes. Characteristic MALDI-TOF peak patterns were obtained for 17 common LMW-GS alleles, including 5 (b, a or c, d, e, f), 7 (a, b, c, d or i, f, g, h) and 5 (a, b, c, d, f) patterns or alleles for the Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3 loci, respectively. In addition, some reproducible MALDI-TOF peak patterns were also obtained that did not match with any known alleles. The results demonstrated a high resolution and throughput nature of MALDI-TOF technology in analyzing LMW-GS alleles, which is suitable for application in wheat breeding programs in processing a large number of wheat lines with high accuracy in limited time. It also suggested that the variation of LMW-GS alleles is more abundant than what has been defined by the current nomenclature system that is mainly based on SDS-PAGE system. The MALDI-TOF technology is useful to differentiate these variations. An international joint effort may be needed to assign allele symbols to these newly identified alleles and determine their effects on end-product quality attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2275620450,"In this paper, we investigate the slip effects on the boundary layer flow and heat transfer characteristics of a power-law fluid past a porous flat plate embedded in the Darcy type porous medium. The nonlinear coupled system of partial differential equations governing the flow and heat transfer of a power-law fluid is transformed into a system of nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations by applying a suitable similarity transformation. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations is solved numerically using Matlab bvp4c solver. Numerical results are presented in the form of graphs and the effects of the power-law index, velocity and thermal slip parameters, permeability parameter, suction/injection parameter on the velocity and temperature profiles are examined."
https://openalex.org/W2200144980,"Nitrous oxide emissions during freeze/thaw periods contribute significantly to annual soil N2O emissions budgets in middle- and high-latitude areas; however, the freeze/thaw-related N2O emissions from waterlogged soils have hardly been studied in the Hulunber Grassland, Inner Mongolia. For this study, the effects of changes in land use/cover types on N2O emissions during freeze-thaw cycles were investigated to more accurately quantify the annual N2O emissions from grasslands. Soil cores from six sites were incubated at varying temperature (ranging from -15 to 10°C) to simulate freeze-thaw cycles. N2O production rates were low in all soil cores during freezing periods, but increased markedly after soil thawed. Mean rates of N2O production differed by vegetation type, and followed the sequence: Leymus chinensis (LC) and Artemisia tanacetifolia (AT) steppes > LC steppes ≥ Stipa baicalensis (SB) steppes. Land use types (mowing and grazing) had differing effects on freeze/thaw-related N2O production. Grazing significantly reduced N2O production by 36.8%, while mowing enhanced production. The production of N2O was related to the rate at which grassland was mowed, in the order: triennially (M3) > once annually (M1) ≥ unmown (UM). Compared with the UM control plot, the M3 and M1 mowing regimes enhanced N2O production by 57.9% and 13.0% respectively. The results of in situ year-round measurements showed that large amounts of N2O were emitted during the freeze-thaw period, and that annual mean fluxes of N2O were 9.21 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1 (ungrazed steppe) and 6.54 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1 (grazed steppe). Our results further the understanding of freeze/thaw events as enhancing N2O production, and confirm that different land use/cover types should be differentiated rather than presumed to be equivalent, regarding nitrous oxide emission. Even so, further research involving multi-year and intensive measurements of N2O emission is still needed."
https://openalex.org/W1945980053,"Alternative splicing is a molecular process that contributes greatly to the diversification of proteome and to gene functions. Understanding the mechanisms of stage-specific alternative splicing can provide a better understanding of the development of eukaryotes and the functions of different genes. Schistosoma japonicum is an infectious blood-dwelling trematode with a complex lifecycle that causes the tropical disease schistosomiasis. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of Schistosoma japonicum to discover alternative splicing events in this parasite, by applying RNA-seq to cDNA library of adults and schistosomula. Results were validated by RT-PCR and sequencing. We found 11,623 alternative splicing events among 7,099 protein encoding genes and average proportion of alternative splicing events per gene was 42.14%. We showed that exon skip is the most common type of alternative splicing events as found in high eukaryotes, whereas intron retention is the least common alternative splicing type. According to intron boundary analysis, the parasite possesses same intron boundaries as other organisms, namely the classic “GT-AG” rule. And in alternative spliced introns or exons, this rule is less strict. And we have attempted to detect alternative splicing events in genes encoding proteins with signal peptides and transmembrane helices, suggesting that alternative splicing could change subcellular locations of specific gene products. Our results indicate that alternative splicing is prevalent in this parasitic worm, and that the worm is close to its hosts. The revealed secretome involved in alternative splicing implies new perspective into understanding interaction between the parasite and its host."
https://openalex.org/W2342178356,"Mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts are multipotent, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like progenitor cells that are widely used in musculoskeletal research. In this study, we have established a clonal population of C3H10T1/2 cells stably-transfected with mRuby2, an orange-red fluorescence reporter gene. Flow cytometry analysis and fluorescence imaging confirmed successful transfection of these cells. Cell counting studies showed that untransfected C3H10T1/2 cells and mRuby2-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells proliferated at similar rates. Adipogenic differentiation experiments demonstrated that untransfected C3H10T1/2 cells and mRuby2-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells stained positive for Oil Red O and showed increased expression of adipogenic genes including adiponectin and lipoprotein lipase. Chondrogenic differentiation experiments demonstrated that untransfected C3H10T1/2 cells and mRuby2-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells stained positive for Alcian Blue and showed increased expression of chondrogenic genes including aggrecan. Osteogenic differentiation experiments demonstrated that untransfected C3H10T1/2 cells and mRuby2-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells stained positive for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as well as Alizarin Red and showed increased expression of osteogenic genes including alp, ocn and osf-1. When seeded on calcium phosphate-based ceramic scaffolds, mRuby2-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells maintained even fluorescence labeling and osteogenic differentiation. In summary, mRuby2-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells exhibit mRuby2 fluorescence and showed little-to-no difference in terms of cell proliferation and differentiation as untransfected C3H10T1/2 cells. These cells will be available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; CRL-3268™) and may be a valuable tool for preclinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W1797959115,"Preferences for risky choices have often been shown to be unstable and context-dependent. Though people generally avoid gambles with mixed outcomes, a phenomenon often attributed to loss aversion, contextual factors can impact this dramatically. For example, people typically prefer risky options after a financial loss, while generally choosing safer options after a monetary gain. However, it is unclear what exactly contributes to these preference shifts as a function of prior outcomes, as these gain/loss outcomes are usually confounded with participant performance, and therefore it is unclear whether these effects are driven purely by the monetary gains or losses, or rather by success or failure at the actual task. Here, we experimentally separated the effects of monetary gains/losses from performance success/failure prior to a standard risky choice. Participants performed a task in which they experienced contextual effects: 1) monetary gain or loss based directly on performance, 2) monetary gain or loss that was randomly awarded and was, crucially, independent from performance, and 3) success or failure feedback based on performance, but without any monetary incentive. Immediately following these positive/negative contexts, participants were presented with a gain-loss gamble that they had to decide to either play or pass. We found that risk preferences for identical sets of gambles were biased by positive and negative contexts containing monetary gains and losses, but not by contexts containing performance feedback. This data suggests that the observed framing effects are driven by aversion for monetary losses and not simply by the positive or negative valence of the context, or by potential moods resulting from positive or negative contexts. These results highlight the specific context dependence of risk preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2182672929,"The use of animal models has facilitated numerous scientific developments, especially when employing “omics” technologies to study the effects of various environmental factors on humans. Our study presents a new bioinformatics pipeline suitable when the generated microarray data from animal models does not contain the necessary human gene name annotation. We conducted single color gene expression microarray on duodenum and spleen tissue obtained from pigs which have been exposed to zearalenone and Escherichia coli contamination, either alone or combined. By performing a combination of file format modifications and data alignments using various online tools as well as a command line environment, we performed the pig to human gene name extrapolation with an average yield of 58.34%, compared to 3.64% when applying more simple methods. In conclusion, while online data analysis portals on their own are of great importance in data management and assessment, our new pipeline provided a more effective approach for a situation which can be frequently encountered by researchers in the “omics” era."
https://openalex.org/W2205051623,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a prevalent human pathogen that causes a variety of diseases, including an increased risk of developing more severe disease in HIV-infected individuals. In Brazil, there is no information about the molecular epidemiology of HSV-1 infection, especially in HIV-infected individuals. The aim of this study was to perform the genotypic characterization of HSV-1 among HIV-infected patients. A total of 214 serum samples from HIV-positive patients without HSV infection symptoms were enrolled in one of two reference hospitals for HIV infection managing in Rio de Janeiro. The gG and gI genes were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and full nucleotide sequencing of the US8 (1601 bp), UL44 (1996 bp), and UL23 (1244 bp) regions was performed. A total of 38.3% (82/214) and 32.7% (70/214) of the serum samples tested positive for gG and gI genes, respectively. RFLP analysis classified the HSV-1 as belonging to genotype A. Phylogenetic analysis of the Brazilian samples for the US8, UL44, and UL23 regions demonstrated that the nucleotide identity between Brazilian samples was higher than 97% for all genes. No acyclovir mutation was detected in the patients. The shedding of HSV in the serum samples from HIV-positive patients who were asymptomatic for HSV infection was detected in this work. This is the first report of molecular characterization of HSV-1 in Brazilian samples since there is no previous data available in the literature concerning the genotypic classification and stable distribution of Brazilian strains of HSV-1 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
