https://openalex.org/W1546091073,"The gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins play important roles in regulating receptor-stimulated signal transduction processes. Recently appreciated among these is their role in the signaling events that lead to the phosphorylation and subsequent desensitization of muscarinic cholinergic (Haga, K., and Haga, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2222-2227) and beta-adrenergic (Pitcher, J. A., Inglese, J., Higgins, J. B., Arriza, J. L., Casey, P. J., Kim, C., Benovic, J. L., Kwatra, M. M., Caron, M. G., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1992) Science 257, 1264-1267) receptors. Beta gamma mediates the membrane targeting of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), in response to receptor activation, through a specific ARK-beta gamma interaction. This process utilizes the membrane-anchoring properties of the isoprenylated gamma subunit of gamma. In the present study, we have employed three distinct approaches to identify the region within the carboxyl terminus of ARK which binds gamma and thereby results in membrane translocation. We studied the ability of gamma to enhance the enzymatic activity of a series of truncated mutants of bovine ARK1, the ability of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing various lengths of the carboxyl terminus of ARK to bind gamma subunits, and the ability of synthetic peptides comprised of ARK sequences to inhibit gamma activation of ARK1. We find that the minimal gamma binding of ARK is localized to a 125-amino acid residue stretch, the distal end of which is located 19 residues from the carboxyl terminus. A single 28-mer peptide (Trp643 to Ser670) derived from this sequence effectively inhibited gamma activation of ARK1, with an IC50 of 76 microM. The identification of this beta gamma binding domain on ARK and the development of peptide inhibitors provide important tools for the study of G protein-coupled receptor desensitization, as well as for the investigation of gamma activation of other G protein-effector systems."
https://openalex.org/W1640150978,"Bovine cytochrome P-450(11 beta) gene (CYP11B) has six different cis-acting elements, Ad1, Ad2, Ad3, Ad4, Ad5, and Ad6, in the promoter region. The Ad4 site also exists in the promoter regions of other steroidogenic P-450 genes as well as in CYP11B1. An Ad4-binding protein (Ad4BP) which specifically binds to the Ad4 site was purified from bovine adrenal cortex nuclear extract, and its molecular mass was 53 kDa. A complementary DNA encoding Ad4BP was isolated from a bovine adrenal cortex cDNA library. The cDNA clone contained an open reading frame of 1383 base pairs encoding 461 amino acids, whose calculated molecular weight was 51,020. The predicted amino acid sequence of Ad4BP revealed that the protein has a zinc finger domain and a ligand binding/dimerization domain. Ad4BP is a novel member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. Comparison of the primary structures of the hormone receptor superfamily showed that Ad4BP was highly homologous to FTZ-F1, which regulates the fushi tarazu gene, and ELP, which is expressed in the murine embryonal carcinoma cells. Transfection of a Ad4BP expression plasmid into CV-1 cells activated the transcription of the CAT reporter gene carrying the Ad4 sequence in the promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W1516845708,"Ku, also known as nuclear Factor IV, is an abundant nuclear DNA-binding protein which requires free DNA ends for the initial interaction with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and can bind at multiple sites along dsDNA in an energy-independent manner. Its function in vivo is unknown, but it has been implicated in both DNA replication and repair and in transcriptional control. We have used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to further define the DNA binding properties of the Ku protein. Titration of Ku to a fixed amount of any of several target linear dsDNA fragments produced ladders of shifted bands proportional to the length of DNA, confirming the multiple binding activity of Ku and demonstrating its sequence-independent nature. Using a short DNA fragment with one Ku binding site, the binding constant of Ku for dsDNA ends was calculated to be 2.4 x 10(9) M-1. Competitive inhibition experiments confirmed the requirement of a free DNA end for binding by Ku and demonstrated that Ku binds isolated nicks in dsDNA. Nick binding was also observed directly using radiolabeled singly nicked circular DNA. The relative affinities of Ku for specific nick sites and free DNA ends were approximately equal, and nick binding was sequence-independent. Finally, in a study of a possible role for Ku in protecting or repairing damaged DNA, Ku was shown to inhibit the ability of T4 DNA ligase to circularize linear dsDNA molecules, demonstrating that some Ku molecules remain at the DNA terminus rather than translocate. A similar inhibition was not observed at nicks. These experiments document a new DNA binding specificity for Ku and further suggest that the high affinity end and nick binding activity is biologically relevant to its functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1494351834,"Full expression of the elastolytic phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa depends on LasA, an extracellular protease with restricted specificity whose mode of action on elastin and biological role is not understood. LasA exhibits amino acid sequence homology to some bacteriolytic proteases and shares several physicochemical properties with the staphylolytic protease of P. aeruginosa. This led us to examine whether the two proteases are the same. Production of LasA and staphylolytic protease by prototrophic and lasA mutant strains of P. aeruginosa was investigated. The two prototrophic strains examined, PAO1 and FRD2, exhibited extracellular staphylolytic activity and secreted LasA. LasA mutants, PAO-E64 lasA1 (Ts), FRD2128 delta lasA, and FRD244 lasA::mTn10, did not exhibit staphylolytic activity. A low level of the LasA protein was detected in the culture filtrate of the temperature-sensitive lasA mutant PAO-E64, but none was detectable in those of the deletion and insertion mutants, FRD2128, and FRD244, respectively. The staphylolytic protease was purified from the culture filtrate of P. aeruginosa strain FRD2 by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed pentaglycine into the respective di- and tripeptides and reacted specifically with antibodies against a synthetic peptide identical in sequence to positions 77-98 in LasA. The amino-terminal sequence of the first 15 amino acid residues of the staphylolytic protease was found to be identical with that of the secreted LasA. These results clearly indicate that LasA is a staphylolytic protease. In addition to lysing staphylococci, it may enhance elastolysis by cleaving Gly-Gly bonds, which are abundant in elastin."
https://openalex.org/W1484076261,"The ras oncogene product, Ras, is synthesized in vivo as a precursor protein that requires post-translational processing to become biologically active and to be capable of transforming mammalian cells. Farnesylation appears to be a critical modification of Ras, and thus inhibitors of the farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase) that catalyzes this reaction may block ras-dependent tumorigenesis. Three structural classes of FPTase inhibitors were identified: (alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl)phosphonic acid, chaetomellic acids, and zaragozic acids. By comparison, these compounds were weaker inhibitors of geranylgeranyl-protein transferases. Each of these inhibitors was competitive with respect to farnesyl diphosphate in the FPTase reaction. All compounds were assayed for inhibition of Ras processing in Ha-ras-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Ras processing was inhibited by 1 microM (alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl)phosphonic acid. Neither chaetomellic acid nor zaragozic acid were active in this assay. These results are the first demonstration that a small organic chemical selected for inhibition of FPTase can inhibit Ras processing in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1596248898,"The laminin-based nonapeptide Cys-Asp-Pro-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg (CDPGYIGSR) and pentapeptide Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) have been previously demonstrated to support the attachment of several cell types and to competitively bind to the 67-kDa high affinity laminin receptor. Cell attachment, but not spreading, on substrates containing adsorbed CDPGYIGSR or YIGSR was observed. In this report we describe YIGSR-mediated attachment and spreading of a wide variety of cell types. GYIGSRY promoted cell spreading and stress fiber formation when it was covalently immobilized through the amino-terminal Gly residue, used as a spacer arm. Spreading was not observed when adsorbed YIGSR peptide was used. Functionally blocking antiserum directed against the 67-kDa and related laminin-binding proteins blocked human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) spreading, but not attachment, on covalently grafted GYIGSRY substrates. However, functionally blocking antisera directed against the vitronectin receptor, integrin alpha v beta 3, and the fibronectin receptor, integrin alpha 5 beta 1, did not affect HFF spreading on these substrates. When HFFs spread on these substrates, the 67-kDa laminin receptor co-localized with the cytoplasmic proteins alpha-actinin and vinculin into discrete structures. These results suggest that the adhesion ligand YIGSR is solely sufficient for cell spreading when it is conformationally constrained by covalent attachment to a solid substrate, at least when attached via its amino terminus. Furthermore, the role of the 67-kDa laminin receptor in recognition of this ligand and mediating cell attachment is confirmed in this study. This report also provides the first evidence for direct or indirect association of this receptor with vinculin and alpha-actinin when YIGSR-mediated cell spreading occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1547769073,"The involvement of Sp1 in regulating cell proliferation in myeloid leukemia cells was determined by measuring the levels and DNA binding activity of Sp1 in TF-1 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line dependent on granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for viability and cell growth. DNA binding of Sp1 to a specific double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide was increased markedly in a dose-dependent manner in proliferating cells in response to GM-CSF compared with growth-arrested or apoptotic cells. Competition experiments and mobility shift interference assays with antibodies against Sp1 as well as wild-type or mutant p53 indicated that GM-CSF-inducible DNA-binding complexes contained both Sp1 and p53 and that these heterocomplexes bound to both p53- and Sp1-binding sequences with high affinity. Immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts with a p53 antibody indicated that Sp1 was associated as a heterocomplex with p53. Formation of this complex was dependent on the level of p53 since p53 was more abundant in proliferating cells and decreased upon induction of growth arrest and apoptosis by withdrawal of GM-CSF while Sp1 levels remained unchanged. These results suggest that the association of Sp1 with p53 may represent a novel mechanism of growth regulation in cytokine-dependent leukemia cells."
https://openalex.org/W1500322150,"Scavenger receptors interact with a variety of modified proteins, mediate their endocytosis and degradation, and may play an important role in protein catabolism and pathogenic processes such as atherosclerosis, aging, and diabetes. Many scavenger receptors have been detected kinetically but few such binding proteins have actually been identified. Recently, we found that two membrane-associated proteins, gp30 and gp18, interact more avidly with albumins conformationally modified by chemical means or by surface adsorption to colloidal gold particles than with native albumin. In this study, we show that gp30 and gp18 behave similarly to other known scavenger receptors. Competition studies indicate a similar ligand binding profile to other known scavenger receptors. Polyanionic molecules (dextran sulfate, fucoidan, polyglutamic acid, polyinosinic acid, heparin) and modified albumins such as formaldehyde-treated or maleylated albumin (Mal-bovine serum albumin) competed with albumin conjugated to colloidal gold particles (A-Au) for the blotting of gp30 and gp18. A-Au and Mal-bovine serum albumin bound cultured endothelial cells with high affinity. Modified and native albumins were each internalized, but only modified albumins were then released degraded. Inhibition studies revealed that only the same molecules that were effective in blocking A-Au blotting of gp30 and gp18, also inhibited A-Au degradation. Addition of the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine resulted in more than 70% inhibition of degradation. Differential processing of A-Au by cultured smooth muscle and endothelial cells along with fibroblasts was observed in a manner consistent with gp30 and gp18 expression. Cumulatively, these results suggest that gp30 and gp18 may mediate the high affinity binding, endocytosis, and degradation of conformationally modified albumins but not native albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1658005505,"The effects of oxidized ATP (oATP) on responses triggered by extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATPe) were investigated in the mouse macrophage-like cell line J774. ATPe induced in this cell line two kinds of responses mediated by two different P2 purinergic receptors: 1) an early permeabilization of the plasma membrane to extracellular hydrophilic markers of M(r) up to 900 mediated by P2Z receptors; and 2) a fast mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores mediated by P2Y receptors. Low oATP concentrations (100 microM) completely blocked the first response without affecting the second. ATPe-dependent cell swelling, vacuolization, and lysis were also inhibited. Antagonism developed slowly, as an incubation at 37 degrees C for at least 2 h in the presence of oATP was needed and was irreversible, thus suggesting that the inhibitory action was due to covalent modification of the receptor. The rate of hydrolysis of exogenous ATP was slightly decreased by oATP, indicating a minor blocking effect of this compound on plasma membrane ecto-ATPases in the concentration range tested. These observations suggest that oATP may be a potentially very useful tool for isolation and characterization of the P2Z purinergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1608042950,"Abstract Glycylsarcosine (Gly-Sar) transport in human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells has been investigated. Gly-Sar transport, from apical to basal surfaces (Ja-b), and intracellular accumulation are greatest when the apical medium is acidified (apical pH 6.0, basal pH 7.4). Both transport and accumulation are susceptible to saturation and competition. Similarly, Gly-Sar transport, from basal to apical surfaces (Jb-a), is increased with acidification of the basal medium (basal pH 6.0, apical pH 7.4). Apical addition of 20 mM Gly-Sar (pH 6.0) to Caco-2 cell monolayers loaded with the pH indicator BCECF (2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein) caused a marked cytosolic acidification. Basolateral application of 20 mM Gly-Sar (pH 6.0) also caused a fall in intracellular pH. These observations are consistent with the expression of H(+)-coupled dipeptide transporters at both membrane faces of the human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell line. We also provide direct evidence for dipeptide-stimulated H(+)-influx, across both apical and basolateral membranes, in this intact epithelial cell system."
https://openalex.org/W1589413565,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is activated at the nuclear membrane in response to a variety of mitogenic stimuli. In human leukemic cells, the beta II PKC isotype is selectively translocated and activated at the nucleus. We recently identified the nuclear envelope component lamin B1 as a major substrate for nuclear PKC both in whole cells and in vitro. Using highly purified human beta II PKC and isolated nuclear envelopes from the human promyelocytic (HL60) leukemia cell line, we have now determined the major sites for beta II PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation. Using a combination of cyanogen bromide cleavage, direct microsequencing, tryptic phosphopeptide, and phosphate release analyses, two major sites of PKC-mediated phosphorylation, Ser395 and Ser405, have been identified. These sites lie within the carboxyl-terminal domain of lamin B immediately adjacent to the central alpha-helical rod domain. Functionally, beta II PKC-mediated phosphorylation of these sites leads to the time-dependent solubilization of lamin B indicative of mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown in vitro. beta II PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation is inhibited by 1) a monoclonal antibody directed against the active site of PKC, 2) a PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide, and 3) a PKC peptide substrate. Two observations indicate that PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation and solubilization is due to direct phosphorylation of lamin B by PKC rather than indirect activation of a cdc2 kinase. Neither immunodepletion with p13suc1 Sepharose beads nor the presence of a p34cdc2 kinase peptide substrate had any effect on PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation. Therefore, we conclude that beta II PKC represents a physiologically relevant lamin kinase that can directly modulate nuclear lamina structure in vitro. Nuclear beta II PKC, like p34cdc2 kinase, may function to regulate nuclear lamina structural stability during cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1602061583,"In situ detection of calpain activation in intact cells has not been possible to date. Here we present the first direct evidence, employing a novel approach, that mu-calpain is rapidly activated at cell membranes in platelets upon a rise in intracellular calcium concentration. Immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies capable of distinguishing between the pre- and postautolysis forms of mu-calpain revealed that treatment of platelets with calcium ionophore causes the preautolysis form of the protease to translocate from cytosol to membranes, where it becomes activated by autolysis. This indicates that proteins associated with membranes serve as primary substrates for calpain in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579118669,Functional complementation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycogen branching enzyme deficiency was screened to isolate human cDNAs that encode this enzyme. Human hepatoma cell line HepG2-derived cDNA libraries using the pAB23BXN yeast expression vector yielded four cDNAs capable of complementing the glc3::TRP1 glycogen branching enzyme mutation. Complementation was recognized by an altered iodine-staining trait. This illustrates that interspecies complementation can be used to isolate rare plasmids from libraries by screening if there is sufficient resolution. The human and yeast glycogen branching enzymes have a 67% identical amino acid sequence over a major portion of their length. The human gene is on chromosome 3.
https://openalex.org/W1480390900,"The crystal structure of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP) with coordinated fatty acid shows the hydrophobic ligand bound within a water-filled central cavity with its carboxyl group engaged in a hydrogen bonding network involving, at least in part, the functional groups of residues R126 and Y128. We produced mutant forms of ALBP which altered these amino acids, expressed these in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and examined their ligand-binding properties using the fluorescent fatty acids cis-parinaric acid (c-PA) and 12-(9-anthroyloxy)-oleate (12-AO). The wild-type and all mutated forms of GST-ALBP displayed similar binding affinities for 12-AO, with Kd,app values ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 microM. The binding affinity of ALBP forms R126Q and Y128W for c-PA were reduced about 30-50-fold in comparison to GST-ALBP, while that for the double mutation R126L + Y128F was below the limits of detection. To determine if the hydrogen bonding system functioned in situ, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants expressing wild-type ALBP demonstrated a moderate (1.5-2-fold) increase in the total rate of [3H]oleate uptake and trafficking into the esterified lipid pools over that of untransfected cells, while the rate of [3H]oleate uptake of the transfected CHOs expressing the R126L + Y128F mutation was identical to that of the control CHOs. In summary, these results suggest that the primary factor contributing to binding affinity of ALBP for fatty acids such as c-PA or oleic acid both in vitro and in situ is the hydrogen bonding network involving at least R126, Y128, and the lipid carboxyl group. However, a ligand with sufficiently large hydrophobic character such as 12-AO can bind in the absence of a functional carboxylate hydrogen bonding network, presumably due to stabilizing entropic interactions with other cavity atoms."
https://openalex.org/W1495293294,"We have fractionated tau isoforms by elution at increasing pH values using iron-chelated affinity chromatography, which discriminates between isoforms phosphorylated to different extents. Microtubule-associated tau elutes from the column at a pH gradient narrower than that of total brain tau. Neither under-phosphorylated nor highly phosphorylated isoforms are found in the microtubule-associated tau protein preparation. This indicates that phosphorylation at certain sites is needed for tau binding to microtubules, whereas phosphorylation at some other sites may prevent the association. The self-association ability of the different tau isoforms has also been analyzed. Tau isoforms containing three tubulin binding motifs form covalently bound dimers more efficiently than tau isoforms containing four motifs. This dimer-forming ability is notably diminished in the presence of a reducing agent, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thus suggesting the involvement of cysteine residues. Additionally, tau forms larger aggregates, as detected by gel permeation chromatography, which are solubilized by SDS and cannot, therefore, be observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These tau aggregates are observed even in the presence of reducing agents. These results support the idea that other regions in the tau molecule, besides the Cys-containing tubulin binding region, also contribute to tau self-association. Tau dimerization and aggregation may be prior steps to the formation of paired helical filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2113330373,"Alkaline phosphatase (PhoA), localized in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli, is a homodimeric metalloprotein containing two intramolecular disulfide bonds. We attempted to clarify the folding-assembly pathways of this enzyme by allowing in vitro-synthesized PhoA polypeptide to fold into active enzyme and by examining the occurrence of similar pathways in vivo by pulse-chase experiments. PhoA (lacking the signal sequence) that was synthesized in a coupled transcription-translation system was effectively converted into active enzyme when incubated with either oxidized glutathione, periplasmic proteins, or purified DsbA protein in the presence of Zn2+. The first appreciable event in the activation of initially unfolded translation product (species I) was the disulfide bond formation, which was immediately followed by folding into a partially trypsin-resistant monomer (species II), and then by assembly into active dimer (species III). The species II PhoA molecules, but not the species III molecules, were found to be sensitized to trypsin in the presence of a reducing agent, dithiothreitol. Pulse-chase studies showed that PhoA acquires disulfide bonds immediately after the biosynthesis, whereas it acquires resistance to both dithiothreitol and certain endogenous protease over some 2 min at 15 degrees C. These results indicate that PhoA undergoes a series of folding-assembly steps, some of which are of measurable speeds in vivo and mimicable in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1532095908,"We have shown previously that GTP-binding regulatory protein (G protein) beta gamma subunits stimulate the agonist- or light-dependent phosphorylation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and rhodopsin by a protein kinase partially purified from porcine brain (mAChR kinase) but not the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase (Haga, K., and Haga, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2222-2227). We report here that the mAChR kinase phosphorylates beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) purified from bovine lung in an agonist-dependent manner, and the phosphorylation is also stimulated by G protein beta gamma subunits. We also report that recombinant beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (beta-ARK1) expressed in COS-7 cells phosphorylates mAChRs (human m2 subtype) and rhodopsin in an agonist- or light-dependent manner, respectively, and that this phosphorylation is stimulated by G protein beta gamma subunits. By contrast, the beta gamma subunits do not stimulate the phosphorylation of mAChRs or rhodopsin by a beta-ARK1 mutant lacking a part of the carboxyl-terminal region which is present in beta-ARKs but not in rhodopsin kinase. These results indicate that the beta-ARK1 is the same as or very similar to the mAChR kinase but is distinguished from the rhodopsin kinase with respect to activation by the beta gamma subunits and that the extra carboxyl-terminal sequence in beta-ARKs is required for the stimulation by the beta gamma subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1829784717,"Cytochrome P450BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium is a soluble, catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid mono-oxygenase that, in structural organization and amino acid sequence, resembles the Class II (microsomal) P450 systems. Its single polypeptide chain contains both a P450 heme domain and an NADPH:P450 reductase domain, each of which bears significant homology with its microsomal counterparts. We report here the critical nature of three amino acids in the reductase domain of this enzyme with respect to FMN binding and catalytic activity. We used site-directed mutagenesis to change glycine 570 to bulkier amino acids; none of these mutant enzymes contained FMN after purification. We also made substitutions for tryptophan 574 and tyrosine 536, which by sequence analogy (Porter, T. D. (1991) Trends Biochem. Sci. 16, 154-158) were proposed to bind FMN through stacking of the aromatic rings with the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin. Mutants of tryptophan 574 which retained the aromatic side chain contained no less than 0.85 mol of FMN per mol of enzyme, while aspartate and glycine substitutions yielded enzymes which did not incorporate FMN. Substitution of tyrosine 536 with aspartate gave an enzyme which contained 0.44 mol of FMN per mol of enzyme but was inactive as a fatty acid hydroxylase and had only 2% of wild-type cytochrome c reductase activity, while the glycine mutant at this position bound no FMN. Furthermore, although all of the mutant enzymes contained 1 mol of FAD per mol of enzyme, the Y536D mutant and those entirely lacking FMN retained no more than 40% of wild-type ferricyanide reductase activity. By assaying these enzymes in the presence of added FMN, we were able to assess the relative importance of the residues in the wild-type sequence with respect to their contribution to FMN binding. In addition, the aromatic mutants of tryptophan 574, which were nearly as active in cytochrome c reduction as wild-type P450BM-3, were only 20% as active in myristate hydroxylation as the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that this amino acid plays an important role in the flow of electrons between the P450 heme and reductase domains."
https://openalex.org/W122438358,"Wheat calmodulin (CaM) was labeled at Cys-27 with the sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent probe 2-(4'-maleimidoanilino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS), to form MIANS.CaM. In the presence of Ca2+, MIANS.CaM undergoes a large fluorescence increase when it binds myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and caldesmon (CaD), but little fluorescence change when it binds CaM antagonists or Ca2+. MLCK associates with MIANS.CaM at a rate of 2.8 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and dissociates at 0.031 s-1 (Kd = 1.1 nM). Protein kinase A phosphorylation of MLCK (P-MLCK) produces a 3.5-fold decrease in its association rate with CaM and a 6-fold increase in its dissociation rate (Kd = 23 nM). CaD associates with MIANS.CaM with a rate of 5.3 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 and dissociates at 57 s-1 (Kd = 108 nM). EGTA disrupts the CaM.MLCK, CaM.P-MLCK, and the CaM.CaD complexes at rates of 3.5 s-1, 6.5 s-1, and 13.5 s-1, respectively. MLCK, therefore, dissociates from CaM more quickly by Ca2+ removal while the lower affinity CaD is dissociated more quickly by competition from higher affinity CaM target proteins than by Ca2+ removal. MLCK binding to CaM slowed Ca2+ dissociation from CaM's C-terminal Ca(2+)-binding sites from 30 s-1 to 6 s-1 while CaD had little effect on Ca2+ dissociation from these sites. During a Ca2+ transient, CaM could exchange with MLCK and CaD rapidly enough for these proteins to be directly involved in the contraction/relaxation cycle of smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1597078415,"The relationship between the size of the substrate binding pocket and the catalytic reactivities with varied alcohols was studied with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase I (ScADH) and compared with the liver enzymes from horse (EqADH, EE isoenzyme) and monkey (MmADH alpha, alpha-isoenzyme). The yeast enzyme is most active with ethanol, and its activity decreases as the size of the alcohol is increased, whereas the activities of the liver enzymes increase with larger alcohols. The substrate pocket in ScADH was enlarged by single substitutions of Thr-48 to Ser (T48S), Trp-57 to Met (W57M), and Trp-93 to Ala (W93A), and a double change, T48S:W93A, and a triple, T48S:W57M:W93A. The T48S enzyme has the same pattern of activity (V/K) as wild-type ScADH for linear primary alcohols. The W57M enzymes have lowered reactivity with primary and secondary alcohols. The W93A and T48S:W93A enzymes resemble MmADH alpha in having an inverted specificity pattern for primary alcohols, being 3- and 10-fold more active on hexanol and 350- and 540-fold less active on ethanol, and are as reactive as the liver enzymes with long chain primary alcohols. The three Ala-93 enzymes also acquired weak activity on branched chain alcohols and cyclohexanol."
https://openalex.org/W1479704824,"Glucocorticoid receptors are basally phosphorylated in the absence of hormone and become hyperphosphorylated after hormone treatment of intact cells. To determine the sequence of changes which the receptor undergoes following hormone binding, we analyzed the kinetics of receptor phosphorylation in WEHI-7 mouse thymoma cells and in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress the mouse receptor. No major differences were found between these two cell types. Cells were preincubated with 32P(i) and [35S] methionine to label the receptors metabolically. The phosphate content of the receptor protein was determined from the ratio of 32P to 35S in radioactive gel slices after immunopurification and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hormone-induced increases in phosphorylation were seen as early as 5 min after adding hormone and persisted for 20 h. Analysis of newly formed cytosolic and nuclear-bound activated (DNA-binding) receptors showed that activation precedes hyperphosphorylation. Nonactivated receptors, both unliganded and hormone-liganded, also became hyperphosphorylated but more slowly than activated receptors. The rate of receptor dephosphorylation, determined by chasing with unlabeled P(i), was much slower than the rate of phosphorylation or of hormone dissociation and appeared to be slightly increased by agonists and by the antagonist RU486 (which does not cause hyperphosphorylation). Mutant WEHI-7 cells lacking cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity gave basal and hormone-induced receptor phosphorylation indistinguishable from wild type cells. We conclude that (a) the substrate for hormone-dependent hyperphosphorylation is the activated hormone-receptor complex; (b) most hyperphosphorylated receptors are recycled and reutilized in hyperphosphorylated form; (c) control of receptor phosphorylation may not be cell-specific; (d) cAMP-dependent protein kinase is not involved directly or indirectly in phosphorylating major sites on the receptor in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1514799224,"Rap1b, a member of the Ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). The experiments presented here were undertaken to determine the precise site of this phosphorylation. Because the Rap1 proteins are highly homologous, there are no specific antibodies able to discriminate between them. To overcome this problem, we used a transient expression system of a fused protein containing in the NH2 terminus an epitope for a known antibody. Using this system, the transfected protein was expressed at a high level and was localized in a perinuclear structure, as previously reported for the endogenous Rap1 proteins. The mutational analysis of Rap1b revealed Ser179 as the residue involved in the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation. The presence of a Lys179 instead of the wild-type Ser179 (resembling the Rap1a sequence) rendered Ser180 a better substrate for phosphorylation caused by protein kinase A. The mobility shift of Rap1b in SDS gels, observed in cells that were stimulated with agonists that increase cAMP, was caused, at least in part, by the phosphorylation of Rap1b."

Cell 3, 1215-1228) suggest that AKAPs anchor PKAII beta at specific in the dendritic cytoskeleton of neurons. This arrangement would place PKAII beta in proximity with its substrates and create target sites for cAMP actions. The foregoing model predicts that (a) RII subunits are freely accessible to AKAPs, (b) PKAII holoenzymes, as well as RII subunits, are anchored, and (c) changes in the level of AKAP can alter the intracellular distribution of type II PKAs. We have addressed these previously untested propositions by overexpressing bovine AKAP75 in a human cell line (HEK293). Non-transfected cells express a low level of endogenous AKAP79, and approximately 90% of RII alpha and RII beta subunits are isolated in the cell cytosol. In contrast, stably transfected cells, which express a 10-fold excess of AKAP75, sequester > 90% of their RII subunits in a particulate pool. Catalytic subunits are also transferred to this pool. AKAP75 accumulates in a cell compartment with biochemical properties characteristic of cytoskeleton. Thus, AKAPs have access to and avidly bind cytoplasmic type II PKAs. Moreover, an increase in AKAP content can alter the particulate/cytoplasmic distribution of PKAII beta and PKAII alpha."
https://openalex.org/W27930973,"Upon activation, factor X participates in the prothrombin activation complex. Similar to 4-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-domainless protein C, the Gla-domainless factor X (GDFX) contains a high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site critical for the function of these molecules. In the case of protein C, we recently demonstrated that the high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site critical for activation is outside the first epidermal growth factor (EGF) homology domain. To examine if this is also true for factor X, we have expressed in human 293 cells a deletion mutant of factor X (E2FX) which lacks the entire Gla region as well as the NH2-terminal EGF homology region of factor X. Direct binding studies by equilibrium dialysis indicate that E2FX contains a single Ca(2+)-binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 154 +/- 48 microM. The functional properties of E2FX are equivalent or improved over those of GDFX. For instance, the factor X coagulant protein of Russell's viper venom activates E2FX three times faster than recombinant GDFX. Kinetic analysis of prothrombin activation in the absence of membranes indicates that activated GDFX and E2FX bind to factor Va with equal affinity (Kd = 4.1 microM). The Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal prothrombin activation rates in the above activation system shifted from 721 +/- 113 microM for activated GDFX to 193 +/- 64 microM for activated E2FX. GDFX and E2FX activation rates with the soluble tissue factor-factor VIIa complex were identical as was the Ca2+ dependence of the reaction. We conclude that E2FX retains a high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site and that the first EGF homology domain does not appear to have a positive functional role in the GDFX molecule. However, Ca2+ occupancy of the Ca(2+)-binding site in the first EGF domain of intact factor X may be essential for optimal prothrombin activation."
https://openalex.org/W1601345735,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) activates oscillatory Ca2+ signaling in pituitary gonadotrophs at a frequency (up to 25 min-1) that is dose-dependent and is determined by the degree of receptor-mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) formation. Similar dose-dependent and frequency-modulated Ca2+ oscillations were elicited by intracellular administration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and its nonhydrolyzable analogs, consistent with models in which Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels determine the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations but do not fluctuate in synchrony with [Ca2+]i. At constant agonist concentrations, Ca2+ spiking varied in amplitude, with a number of progressively larger transients before the onset of maximal oscillations, followed by a gradual decrease in spike amplitude that was accompanied by an increase in spiking frequency. The decline in the amplitude and increase in frequency of Ca2+ transients during stimulation by GnRH were not related to a decrease in the propagation of the Ca2+ signal within the cell but were associated with gradual depletion of the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool. Once initiated, the pattern of Ca2+ spiking was not altered by blockade of receptor occupancy, by inhibition of phospholipase C, or by reduction of extracellular [Ca2+]. Also, the endoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+)-ATPase blocker, thapsigargin, could substitute for Ins(1,4,5)P3 in initiating the oscillatory Ca2+ response. These findings indicate that although the Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration determines the pattern of transients at the initiation of the oscillatory Ca2+ signal, maintenance of the signal does not require a sustained rise in Ins(1,4,5)P3. Since the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations is also influenced by depletion of luminal [Ca2+], it is possible that the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive channels in the endoplasmic reticulum are tonically inhibited by high intraluminal Ca2+ levels and that Ins(1,4,5)P3 surmounts such inhibition by promoting Ca2+ discharge. When a critical level of Ca2+ discharge is attained, repetitive Ca2+ transients are generated by an autocatalytic mechanism in which a sustained rise in Ins(1,4,5)P3 is not an essential requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1582176166,"Two new polypeptides, termed ISG70 and ISG64, have been found in Trypanosoma brucei, using enzyme-catalyzed radioiodination techniques. Both are externally disposed integral membrane glycoproteins, containing N-linked carbohydrate chains. No structural homology was detected between ISG70, ISG64, or the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) when assessed by 1) comparative peptide mapping, 2) immunoprecipitation analysis, and 3) lectin affinity chromatography. ISG70 occurred in 5.1 x 10(4) copies/cell and has been purified 880-fold from detergent extracts of plasma membranes by a procedure that includes gel filtration, lectin affinity chromatography, and preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ISG70 was present only in bloodstream forms and was specifically detected in six different cloned variants from the Molteno Institute trypanosomal antigen type (MITat) serodeme of T. brucei and from the single cloned variant of the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases trypanosomal antigen type (ILTat) serodeme that was examined. Rabbits with chronic infections of T. brucei displayed circulating antibodies against ISG70. Both the immunogenicity of ISG70 and its invariant nature suggest that it may be useful in the development of an effective serodiagnostic test. Furthermore, its stage-specific location combined with its invariant nature implies that its function is strictly related to a physiological role required for the parasite's residence in its mammalian host."
https://openalex.org/W137892143,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a potent smooth muscle cell mitogen. Smooth muscle cell and macrophage-derived foam cells, resulting from cholesteryl ester accretion, are hallmark characteristics of atherosclerosis. We wanted to determine if bFGF synthesis is altered during cholesteryl ester accumulation in smooth muscle cells. Cholesteryl ester enrichment causes a 3-fold increase in bFGF in cellular lysates and a 3-fold increase in steady state mRNA levels for bFGF, as compared with control cells. Conditioned media from cholesteryl ester-enriched smooth muscle cells contains 6 times more mitogenic activity than conditioned media from control cells; this activity is neutralized by an antibody directed against bFGF but not by an antibody directed against platelet-derived growth factor. These results suggest that cholesteryl ester enrichment also enhances bFGF release. Since oxysterols have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, we determined if oxysterols could affect bFGF production and release. 25-Hydroxycholesterol also increases the release of bFGF-like mitogens from smooth muscle cells, as well as increasing mRNA transcript levels for bFGF. Cholesteryl ester enrichment and 25-hydroxycholesterol did not promote bFGF release secondary to cell injury. In conclusion, these data define a basic mechanism for smooth muscle cell hyperplasia during atherogenesis involving the generation of bFGF by smooth muscle cell-derived foam cells."
https://openalex.org/W1935829253,"Crystals of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein which diffract to near atomic resolution have been obtained in Na/K phosphate buffer/precipitant system. The structures of the apo-form and the protein with bound oleic acid and stearic acid have been determined and refined to 1.6-A resolution with R-factor around 18%. The conformations of the bound fatty acids are nearly the same. In both cases, the carboxylate group of the ligand interacts directly with Arg126 and Tyr128, indirectly with Arg106 through a water molecule. The hydrocarbon tail sticks out of the protein surface through a hydrophobic patch. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids bind in essentially the same conformation. The remaining space of the binding pocket is filled with well ordered water molecules interacting with most of the polar side chains. Comparisons between the holo- and apostructures reveal that the hydrophobic patch on the protein surface formed by a helix and several tight turns might serve as a portal for lipid binding. Since the adipocyte lipid-binding protein is phosphorylated at Tyr19 by the insulin receptor kinase, the position of this side chain has been re-evaluated using the coordinates of the holo-forms. It appears that the position of Tyr19 does not change significantly upon the binding of either of the fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W203191866,"Ac-208 is a plastocyanin-deficient mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that contains only 2-3% of the wild-type level of plastocyanin-encoding mRNA and no detectable plastocyanin. Sequence analysis of the ac-208 plastocyanin-encoding gene reveals a single nucleotide insertion in the first exon compared with the wild-type gene; this alters the reading frame and results in a premature nonsense codon. We have introduced the genomic sequence encoding plastocyanin from a wild-type strain into ac-208 by cotransformation with a selectable marker encoding nitrate reductase. Of 22 nit+ transformants characterized, nine contained additional plastocyanin-encoding sequences (compared with untransformed cells) and each of these nine transformants was found to accumulate the protein. Transformants that do not contain newly introduced plastocyanin sequences retain the plastocyanin-deficient phenotype. The introduced plastocyanin-encoding sequences are stable during mitotic growth in liquid culture over a period of several months, as is expression from the introduced sequences. We suggest that the decreased steady state level of plastocyanin-encoding messages is a consequence of the frame-shift mutation in the structural gene. The ability to complement ac-208 with plastocyanin-encoding sequences will allow the introduction and analysis of in vitro mutagenized plastocyanin sequences in vivo in transgenic C. reinhardtii cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562482996,"A mouse gene (referred to as Emb) encoding a novel class of POU domain is described. The Emb POU domain shares only 40-50% homology to that of any other POU proteins. Nonetheless, the Emb POU domain can bind to the octamer sequence like other POU domains. Emb is a single-copy gene, located on the distal region of mouse chromosome 15. It is expressed in embryo throughout post-implantation stages, where the most prominent expression is seen in developing central nervous system. In the adult, it is highly expressed in brain, whereas weaker expression can be detected in other organs such as testis, skeletal muscle, and kidney. The expression in adult brain is most evident in neurons of hypocampus formation. Two types of Emb mRNA are expressed in brain; one type encodes a protein of 301 amino acids residues, whereas the other codes for a protein with two extra amino acids residues added at the amino-terminal end of POU domain. These two mRNA species are generated by alternative splicing by utilizing an unusual splice acceptor site: CCTCCCTCTG/. Emb mRNA expressed in testis, on the other hand, encodes a smaller protein lacking most of the amino-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W1534817676,"Everted membrane vesicles were prepared from Escherichia coli cells containing either overproduced amounts (OP-membrane vesicles) or normal amounts (normal membrane vesicles) of SecY and SecE, both of which are essential components of the protein translocation apparatus. The rates of translocation of pro-OmpA were similar in the two types of membrane vesicles, whereas translocation ATPase activity, which requires SecA, a precursor protein (pro-OmpA), and membrane vesicles, was appreciably higher with OP-membrane vesicles than with normal membrane vesicles. Since ATP hydrolysis has been shown to take place at an earlier part of the translocation reaction, these results suggest that the overproduction of SecY and SecE enhanced the activity of the earlier process, but not the entire process, of the translocation reaction. The addition of pro-OmpA in the presence of SecA caused the partial collapse of delta pH (inside acidic) generated on OP-membrane vesicles, suggesting that protons come out from the inside of the membrane vesicles in a pro-OmpA-dependent manner. The collapse of delta pH caused by pro-OmpA required SecA, ATP, and SecY and was not detected when normal membrane vesicles were used. These results indicate that the early event of protein translocation, which requires the functioning of SecA, SecY, and SecE, causes the countermovement of protons."
https://openalex.org/W1489372046,"Resting human neutrophils acylate 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC; lyso-PAF) specifically with arachidonate (AA); upon stimulation, however, the specificity is lost and other fatty acid residues are added. The major goals of this study were to compare the various acylation reactions present in the cells and to determine the cause of the specificity loss upon stimulation. The CoA-independent transacylase was active in neutrophil homogenates and was found to be both highly specific for AA and stereospecific, requiring 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC for activity. Homogenates also contained acyl-CoA:1-radyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acyltransferase activity, which transferred acyl chains from oleoyl-, linoleoyl-, or linolenoyl-CoA to both 1-alkyl and 1-acyl acceptors, but preferred the 1-acyl acceptor when arachidonoyl-CoA was used. The CoA-dependent and -independent activities co-sedimented on a discontinuous Percoll gradient in a single band containing plasma membrane and possibly other membranes. CoA alone promoted nonspecific acylation in the homogenates. The AA-specific acylation was attenuated up to 80% in sonicates of ionophore-stimulated cells, whereas the CoA-dependent acyltransferase remained unchanged. Potential phospholipid AA donors for the transacylase were substantially depleted in the stimulated cells but could not account for the large decrease in acylation. An accumulation of 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (alkenyl-2-lyso-GPE), which acts as a competing substrate, appeared to be the major cause of the reduced AA-specific acylation of lyso-PAF observed in the stimulated preparations. Removal of the alkenyl-2-lyso-GPE restored the activity, whereas the addition of alkenyl-2-lyso-GPE (2 microM) to resting membrane preparations resulted in a marked decrease in transacylation of lyso-PAF."
https://openalex.org/W1493281764,"Although the paradigm for the acquisition of photosynthetic organelles is the endocytosis of cyanobacteria-like progenitors by heterotrophic protists, details of this evolutionary process are unclear. The small organellar chromosomes are remnants of the larger bacterial genomes with most genes from the endosymbiont's DNA having been either relocated to the protist's nucleus or entirely lost. As a result of those gene transfers, differences exist between plastids from different algal phyla and higher plants. We report here on the retention of a secY gene in cyanelle (= plastid) DNA of the eukaryotic protist Cyanophora paradoxa. This cyanelle secY encodes a functional protein homologous to SecY of Escherichia coli, identified as a subunit of the preprotein translocase complex. Similarity of the cyanelle and E. coli SecY topology, predicted from sequence information, has been confirmed experimentally through SecY-PhoA fusion protein analysis in E. coli. Cyanelle SecY, expressed in an E. coli secY mutant, substituted for the defective prokaryotic SecY. A plastid-encoded gene for a membrane protein functioning in protein transport across plastid membranes is unprecedented in higher plants. From these results we infer that a functional homolog of the prokaryotic preprotein translocation machinery is retained in some plastids."
https://openalex.org/W1517107253,"Abstract The repair by UvrABC endonuclease of two major adducts formed by aflatoxin B1 in DNA was found to be similar. Aflatoxin epoxide was used to generate the aflatoxin B1.N7-guanine adduct which can convert to aflatoxin B1-formamidopyrimidine adduct. The reaction of the aflatoxin B1 epoxide with DNA follows pseudo-first order kinetics. The DNA sequence-specific relative reactivity of the epoxide is the same as previously observed for aflatoxin B1 activated by liver microsomes, therefore strongly reinforcing the notion that aflatoxin B1 reacts with DNA through the epoxide intermediate. For the majority of lesion sites, a high affinity protein-DNA complex was formed from the UvrA and the UvrB proteins with similar efficiency to both adducts, and to pyrimidine dimers, and then nicks the DNA when UvrC was added. The two incisions are at the eighth phosphodiester moiety 5' and the sixth phosphodiester moiety 3' of a modified guanine nucleotide. Both incisions appeared to be concerted. For some sites, the DNA sequence can alter the relative incision efficiency up to 15-fold. However, the majority of these AFB1 lesion structures in most DNA sequences are similar with respect to recognition by this nucleotide excision repair enzyme. Therefore the observation that the aflatoxin B1.N7-guanine lesion is removed rapidly, while the aflatoxin B1-formamidopyrimidine lesion persists in the mammalian cell may have other mechanistic explanations."
https://openalex.org/W1914372629,"Induction of heat shock genes is mediated by heat shock factor (HSF). Our recent genomic footprinting experiments demonstrate that HSF binds constitutively to perfect and imperfect heat shock elements (HSEs) in the HSP26 gene in yeast. Site-directed mutagenesis of the single perfect HSE, previously reported to not be involved in regulating gene expression, significantly reduces the rate of response of the gene to heat shock. However, the same mutation only slightly reduced the rate of accumulation of HSP26 mRNA during heat shock. Genomic footprinting experiments indicate that this lag in response to heat shock is due to the failure of HSF to bind efficiently to the mutated HSE. The rate of response to heat shock of synthetic promoters containing one, two, three, or seven perfect HSEs was similar to that observed for the wild-type HSP26 gene. These results suggest that the rate of response to heat shock is correlated with HSF occupancy of HSEs, rather than the number of HSEs in a promoter. As with the wild-type and mutant HSP26 genes, the rate of accumulation of mRNA from synthetic promoters increased only moderately with an increase in the number of HSEs. These results suggest that as few as two HSE-HSF complexes are sufficient to saturate HSF's target in the basal transcription apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1604401399,"Several mutations in psbD (coding for the photosystem II reaction protein D2) lead to a loss of the entire photosystem II complex from the thylakoid membrane. For two site-directed D2 mutants, E69V (Glu-69 mutated to Val) and ET-9 (introducing a premature stop codon in psbD), and two psbD deletion mutants, the synthesis and degradation of photosystem II reaction center components were analyzed. In E69V, no D2 or psbC-encoded CP43 was detected upon 5-min pulse labeling or Western blotting, whereas a psbDI/C transcript was present. Either D2 and CP43 are very unstable in this mutant, or the mutation causes an inhibition of translation of the psbDC operon. In E69V, the predominant lifetime of D1 is several minutes, but a small fraction of D1 remains stable in the thylakoid for several hours. In E69V, also a 43-kDa band is detected by D1 antisera. We attribute this band to a D1 cross-linking product possibly involved in D1 degradation. We identified a D1 precursor in E69V and psbDI/C/DII-, two mutants with particularly short D1 lifetimes. A unique feature of the E69V mutant is that destabilization of the photosystem II complex is triggered by a single-site mutation leading to extremely rapid turnover or lack of synthesis of D2."
https://openalex.org/W1482902326,"The effect of glutamine and asparagine on glucose metabolism has been studied in ascites tumor cells. Either of these amino acids decreased the glycolytic flux about 80%. Half-maximal effects were obtained with 0.14 mM glutamine and 0.087 mM asparagine. Among the 20 L-amino acids, only glutamate produced a similar effect. Glutamine and asparagine caused a 70% increase of hexose monophosphates and a large decrease of fructose-1,6-P2 and triose phosphates, evidencing a strong inhibition of the phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.11) reaction. Analysis of the levels of various phosphofructokinase effectors revealed that fructose-2,6-P2 and AMP decreased 4-fold, phosphoenolpyruvate, citrate, and ATP increased 4-, 3-, and 1.8-fold, respectively, and that there was no change in ADP, Pi, and intracellular pH. Assay of phosphofructokinase at concentrations of substrates and effectors determined to be in the cells showed that the low activity of this enzyme could be accounted for by the change in the concentration of effectors, the major mechanism being the change in adenine nucleotides. The decrease in fructose-2,6-P2 contributed very little to the inhibition of phosphofructokinase activity. The effects of amino acids were prevented by amino-oxyacetate, suggesting that transamination was an obligatory step for these changes."
https://openalex.org/W1581129388,"We have demonstrated by several lines of evidence that in platelets myristate is linked to proteins predominantly via thioester bonds as is palmitate, and the covalent binding of the two long chain saturated fatty acids to proteins involves the same mechanisms. The first piece of evidence to support the thioester linkage between myristate and proteins is that [3H]myristate could be removed from proteins via alkaline methanolysis, which disrupts ester bonds but not amide bonds. The second piece of evidence is that unlabeled palmitate, which can form only thioester bonds in physiologic concentrations, competitively inhibits the formation of alkaline methanolysis-sensitive covalent bonds between [3H]myristate and proteins. Third, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, the patterns of labeled proteins from [3H]myristate- and [3H]palmitate-labeled platelets are identical. Fourth, [3H]myristate-labeled proteins, like [3H]palmitate-labeled proteins, both release their fatty acid moieties when exposed to hydroxylamine at neutral pH, which disrupts thioester but not hydroxyester bonds. These findings indicate that although the covalent binding of palmitate to proteins was found to occur at a faster rate than that of myristate, protein S fatty acid acylation that occurs posttranslationally is not specific for palmitate."
https://openalex.org/W1510948177,"Mast cells and macrophages coexist in the human arterial intima where oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) also takes place during atherosclerosis. To investigate whether mast cells play a role in macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL, a model system was designed in which mast cells and macrophages were cocultured in incubation medium containing LDL. Stimulation of rat serosal mast cells to induce exocytosis of their cytoplasmic granules was found to inhibit macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL. The inhibitory effect depended on the ability of mast cell-derived histamine, released from the exocytosed granules into the medium, to bind the copper ions necessary for propagation of the macrophage-initiated oxidation of LDL. In addition to binding free copper ions, the mast cell-derived histamine was also capable of inhibiting oxidation of LDL propagated by copper ions bound to the apolipoprotein B component of the LDL particle. The results indicate that mast cells may prevent cell-mediated oxidation of LDL and imply a potentially preventive role for the mast cell in atherosclerosis."

This protein has been characterized and shown to be an RNA-binding protein with nuclease activity which is associated with, but distinct from, the 80-kDa 2-5A-binding protein known previously as RNase L. It is therefore proposed that the 2-5A-dependent RNase L is a complex of two distinct subunits: an 80-kDa RNA-binding protein (i.e. the catalytic subunit) and an 80-kDa 2-5A-binding protein (i.e. the regulatory subunit)."
https://openalex.org/W1515863454,"Insulin-degrading enzyme is a nonlysosomal metalloprotease that initiates degradation of internalized insulin in some cells. We previously identified a potential catalytic site containing an inversion of the Zn(2+)-binding domain of the thermolysin family (Kuo, W.-L., Gehm, B. D., and Rosner, M. R. (1991) Mol. Endocrinol. 4, 1580-1591). The role of this site in catalysis was examined by mutating one of the presumptive Zn(2+)-coordinating histidines (His108) in human insulin-degrading enzyme to leucine or glutamine, which were predicted to reduce or eliminate Zn2+ binding without substantially altering secondary structure. cDNAs for the mutant and wild-type enzymes were incorporated into an expression vector and transfected into COS cells. Expression of the transfected genes was confirmed by Northern and Western blots. In contrast to the wild-type gene, which increased insulin degradation by cell extracts and intact cells several-fold, the mutated genes had no effect on insulin degradation, indicating a loss of catalytic activity. However, the mutants' ability to bind substrate was unimpaired, as affinity labeling with 125I-insulin was increased compared to the wild type. These results suggest that an intact Zn(2+)-binding domain in human insulin-degrading enzyme is required for catalytic activity and can affect, but is not required for, substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1539147639,"The vaccinia virus L1R gene product is a late protein destined for insertion into the envelope of intracellular virus particles. Because this protein is co-translationally modified by the addition of myristic acid to the penultimate NH2-terminal glycine residue, it was of interest to identify the modification signal within the L1R protein and to assess the relevance of myristylation to protein localization. To this end, a family of chimeric reporter genes containing 0-13 codons from the NH2 terminus of the L1R open reading frame fused in-frame to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was constructed. The encoded proteins were tested as myristylation substrates in cell-free extracts and infected cells. The results obtained in vitro and in vivo were similar and suggested that although the NH2-terminal 5 amino acids of the L1R protein were the minimum signal required to observe modification by myristate, 12 amino acids were required to obtain wild type levels of myristylation with a modulating role played by the intervening amino acid residues. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation of infected cells expressing the fusion proteins indicated that the NH2 terminus of the L1R protein was capable of targeting the fusion proteins to membrane-containing fractions only if myristylated. In particular, the myristylated fusion protein containing the first 12 amino acids of the L1R protein abutted to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein was found associated with the envelope of intracellular vaccinia virus particles."
https://openalex.org/W1558551598,"When the coding sequence for human transferrin receptors was expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line lacking endogenous transferrin receptors, 86-kDa molecules containing three N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides were synthesized. These rapidly dimerized to form 172-kDa molecules which increased in size to 190 kDa. After site-directed mutagenesis of all three N-glycosylation sites, 80-kDa receptors were synthesized and only a few dimers were formed. 84-kDa monomers were synthesized in the absence of the oligosaccharide attached to Asn727 or Asn317. Dimerization and maturation through the Golgi body of the Asn727 mutant receptors were much slower than the wild type whereas the Asn317 mutant receptors behaved more similarly to the wild type. Lack of the oligosaccharide at Asn251 gave rise to 73-kDa monomers because of proteolytic processing (Hoe, M. H., and Hunt, R. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4916-4923), but a second mutation at a potential cleavage site allowed the formation of 84-kDa receptors. These also dimerized at a similar rate to wild type receptors. The three-site mutant receptors were degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum but all three 84-kDa single site mutant receptor species migrated to the cell surface. However, receptors lacking the oligosaccharide at Asn727 bound and internalized little transferrin as a result of reduced affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1583647304,"Factor IX is synthesized in a precursor form with a propeptide that contains the gamma-carboxylation recognition site, an element which directs the post-translational gamma-carboxylation of adjacent glutamic acid residues. After protein synthesis, the propeptide is cleaved to yield the mature Factor IX. To study propeptide processing, anti-proFactor IX antibodies were prepared using a synthetic peptide based upon the sequence of the Factor IX propeptide. Immunoaffinity-purified anti-proFactor IX antibodies were reactive with Factor IX Cambridge, a mutant form of Factor IX containing the propeptide, but were not reactive with Factor IX. These antibodies were used to examine the proteolytic processing of forms of Factor IX containing point mutations at P6, P3, P2, P1, P1', P2', and P3' adjacent to the propeptide cleavage site in order to determine the requirement of each of these amino acids for propeptide cleavage. Furthermore, the hierarchy of different pairs of basic residues at positions P1 and P2 was analyzed. The mutated cDNA constructs were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Propeptide processing was examined using intrinsically labeled Factor IX immunoprecipitated with either anti-pro-Factor IX antibodies or anti-Factor IX:total antibodies, and the Factor IX species were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Under the expression conditions employed, the propeptide of wild type Factor IX was almost completely removed, whereas Factor IX mutated to threonine at P1 was not cleaved. The percentage of propeptide cleaved varied with the amino acid sequences of residues P2 and P1, respectively: Lys-Arg (93%), Arg-Arg (66%), Thr-Arg (33%), Arg-Lys (19%), Lys-Lys (10%), and Lys-Thr (< 1%). Apart from alterations of basic amino acids at P1 and P2, nonconservative mutations at P6 and P3 decreased propeptide cleavage, whereas conservative mutations at P3, P1', P2', or P3' resulted in cleavage efficiencies approximately equal to that for wild type Factor IX. These results indicate that the preference of paired basic residues at P1 and P2 is similar to other endopeptidases active toward proteins secreted through the constitutive pathway and that the propeptide residues NH2-terminal to these paired basic residues are important in defining enzyme-substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1604008009,"Toxin generated by activation of the Bacillus thuringiensis CryIA(c) crystal protein (protoxin) with bovine trypsin was separated into two components by anion-exchange chromatography. One component (T2) was DNA-associated toxin, and the other was the DNA-free toxin (T1). Only one major protoxin component was observed, and it was found to be associated with DNA. The DNA from the T2 toxin varied in size from 100 to 300 base pairs, whereas the crystal and the solubilized protoxin contained 20-kilobase DNA as the major DNA component. DNase treatment converted the T2 toxin to the DNA-free T1 toxin. In contrast, the DNA in the crystal and the solubilized protoxin was resistant to DNase digestion and was not dissociated from the protein by 1.5 M NaCl. The protoxin and DNA appeared to elute as a complex with a molecular mass of > 2 x 10(6) Da on gel-filtration chromatography. No toxin was generated from the protoxin with trypsin after extensive digestion of the protoxin with DNase or dissociation of the DNA by succinylation of the lysine residues. It is proposed that DNA binds to the COOH-terminal half of the crystal protein and is essential for maintaining the conformational integrity required for crystal formation and generation of toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2342851382,"We described the synthesis of a quiescence-specific p20K protein in quiescent chicken heart mesenchymal cells and contact-inhibited chicken embryo fibroblasts (Bedard, P.-A., Balk, S.D., Gunther, H.S., Morisi, A., and Erikson, R.L. (1987a) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 1450-1459). We now report that the expression of p20K is enhanced in cells rendered quiescent by other conditions of growth arrest such as serum starvation or treatment with hydroxyurea. Chicken embryo fibroblasts transformed by the Rous sarcoma virus also expressed p20K upon serum/medium depletion. In all conditions investigated, the synthesis of p20K was correlated with decreased DNA synthesis, indicating that growth arrest regulates the expression of p20K in fibroblasts. The abundance of p20K mRNAs was elevated in quiescent cells, and the p20K gene was more active in nuclear run-on transcription assays in conditions of growth arrest. The p20K gene was isolated, and the promoter region was analyzed in transient expression assays. Serum starvation increased the activity of the promoter, indicating that the expression of p20K is controlled at least in part at the transcriptional level. Deletion analysis revealed that a region of less than 217 base pairs (bp) is sufficient for quiescence-dependent activity of the promoter. Within this region, a segment of 48 bp was essential to basal and quiescence-induced activity of the promoter in dividing and nondividing cells, respectively. The 48-bp region enhanced the activity of a minimal heterologous promoter in quiescent cells but had no effect in conditions of proliferation, indicating that it functions as a quiescence-responsive unit (QRU). Therefore, the transcription of the p20K gene in quiescent fibroblasts is controlled by the one or several growth-regulated elements located in the 48-bp QRU of the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1524481888,"The origin of phage G4 DNA complementary strand synthesis (G4oric) consists of three stem-loop structures (stem loops I, II, and III) that have been proposed as a recognition site for primase during primer RNA (pRNA) synthesis (Godson, G. N., Barrell, B. G., Staden, R., and Fiddes, J. C. (1978) Nat. New Biol. 276, 236-247; Fiddes, J. C., Barrell, B. G., and Godson, G. N. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 1081-1085; Sims, J., Capon, D., and Dressler, D. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12615-12628). It is generally considered that the double-stranded DNA stem-loop structure is not coated with Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), but is recognized by primase as naked DNA (Kornberg, A., and Baker, J. (1992) DNA Replication, 2nd Ed., p. 280, W. H. Freeman & Co., New York). Using small G4oric single-stranded DNA fragments of various sizes (302, 278, 149, and 100 nucleotides) consisting of the core 100-nucleotide stem-loop region plus differing lengths of 3'- and 5'-flanking sequence as substrates for gel retardation and DNase I and micrococcal nuclease digestion, we show that under conditions of pRNA synthesis, two SSB tetramers bind to the stem-loop structure. With increasing lengths of 5'- and 3'-flanking sequence, more SSB tetramers are added. Regardless of the number of SSB tetramers bound, however, the region of DNA containing the pRNA initiation site is always left accessible to nuclease digestion. In situ copper-phenanthroline footprinting of individual gel shift assembly intermediates shows that on the 302-nucleotide G4oric, the first two SSB tetramers assemble at random, but the addition of more SSB tetramers results in formation of a unique structure. In this structure, SSB tetramers protect both sides of stem loop III plus the intervening region between stem loops III and I, but leave most of stem loop I and the CTG pRNA initiation site accessible to copper-phenanthroline. Primase can only synthesize pRNA when the stem-loop structure is saturated with SSB and presumably in the unique configuration. The G4oric stem-loop structure therefore appears to dictate the phasing of SSB to leave a primase recognition site as free DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1594314084,"Considerable effort is being made to design anti-viral drugs for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection process. Some of this work has focused on CD4 protein, the HIV-1 receptor on T helper lymphocytes. One drug that binds to CD4 protein and inhibits both viral infection and growth is DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate). DIDS is best known for its ability to inhibit erythrocyte band 3 anion exchange. Although the antiviral potency of DIDS is evident in vitro (IC50 approximately 30 microM), intravenous administration of DIDS should not be effective owing to the large number of band 3 molecules present on the red blood cell membrane (approximately 10(6)/cell), and to the very small Kd for DIDS binding to band 3 (approximately 30 nM). Therefore, we sought to identify other anion transport inhibitors that would bind weakly to band 3, but tightly to CD4 protein, and that could be administered to humans without significant toxic side effects. On the basis of our previous work with band 3 (Salhany, J. M., Rauenbuehler, P. B., and Sloan, R. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15965-15973), we elected to study the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) to soluble CD4 protein. We have discovered that PLP binds surprisingly tightly to soluble CD4 protein (Kd = 45 microM), with a stoichiometry of about 1 mol of PLP/mol of protein. Furthermore, PLP binding was found to be competitive with DIDS for its binding site on soluble CD4 protein. These results suggest that PLP may be an effective anti-viral agent for the HIV-1 infection process."
https://openalex.org/W1562118347,"Growth of Chinese hamster ovary and LM cells is inhibited by relatively low concentrations of sphingosine in the culture media. This effect is diminished by an order of magnitude by conversion of this positively charged long-chain amino alcohol to a number of N-acetylated analogues, such as N-acetylsphingosine, N-acetylsphingosine phosphate, and N-acetylsphingosine phosphorylcholine. Synthesis of sphinganine and its incorporation into ceramide, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipids (GSL) was monitored using a short pulse of [14C]serine together with a long pulse of [3H]-galactose. Compared to unsupplemented cultures, growth with 15-30 microM N-acetylsphingosine suppressed incorporation of 14C radioactivity into ceramide, sphingomyelin, and GSL by 75-95% without accumulation of labeled sphinganine and without any appreciable change in membrane phospholipid or total GSL content. Furthermore, when cells were cultivated with 15 microM [4,5-3H]N-acetylsphinganine to monitor its utilization for sphingolipid synthesis, considerable loss of radiolabel occurred due to desaturation of sphinganine to sphingosine. Nevertheless, most of the residual label was found in the long-chain base and not the acyl group of sphingomyelin, indicating that the exogenously supplied base was utilized intact for complex lipid synthesis. Radiolabel was also found in ceramide and glycosphingolipid fractions. Thus, established cell lines whose growth is very sensitive to long-chain amino alcohols can be cultivated with sphinganine (sphingosine) analogues at concentrations which suppress endogenous sphinganine production but support continued synthesis of complex sphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1536704375,"Residue Asp60 of the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain of Escherichia coli is though to interact with the pyrrole NH of substrate indole-3-glycerol phosphate and facilitate its cleavage to indole and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Two distinguishable partial revertants of DN60 tryptophan synthetase alpha mutant trpA34 were analyzed. The slower growing partial revertant, PR1, had the second-site change, YD102. The other partial revertant, PR2, lacked three consecutive base pairs, resulting in replacement of Ala59 and Asn60 of the DN60 mutant alpha polypeptide by Asp. Inspection of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme-substrate analog complex revealed that Tyr102 is in the vicinity of the pyrrole NH of the substrate. The PR1 alpha chain has a near normal Km for substrate, whereas the PR2 polypeptide has greatly reduced substrate affinity. The PR2 polypeptide is more active than the PR1 polypeptide in the alpha beta reaction in vitro and appears to be more active than the PR1 polypeptide in vivo. Attempts to obtain repeat occurrences of the PR2 deletion mutation were unsuccessful. A third type of trpA34 partial revertant, PR3, that grows very poorly in minimal medium, also has a Tyr102 replacement: YF102. These findings demonstrate that each of the second-site mutations affects a residue located in the vicinity of the active site residue altered by the primary mutation. Slightly leaky mutant trpA89, genetically altered near the site of the trpA34 mutation, was found to have a GS61 substitution."
