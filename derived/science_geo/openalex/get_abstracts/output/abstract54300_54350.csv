https://openalex.org/W2037226571,"Inoculation of 64-10 or Raji cultures with Epstein-Barr virus derived from the HRI-K clone of the P3J Burkitt's lymphoma line caused abortive infections in most of the lymphoblastoid cells with synthesis of ""early antigens"" but few, if any, capsids. Antibodies to early antigens were detected by indirect immunofluorescence in serums of many patients with infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt's lymphoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. These antibodies were rarely present in other serums even though some of them showed high titers of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus when assayed on EB3 Burkitt tumor cells; they also prevented synthesis of early antigens, provided the serums were mixed with the virus prior to inoculation. Antibodies to early antigens possibly reflect current or recent disease processes that are associated with the virus."

https://openalex.org/W2044866113,"A dose-response relation was established between prostaglandins and formation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the mouse ovary. The prostaglandin antagonist, 7-oxa-13-prostynoic acid, blocked the stimulatory effect of prostaglandin E(1), prostaglandin E(2), and luteinizing hormone on adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate formation in a competitive manner. Kinetic studies made it possible to suggest that there is a single luteinizing-hormone-related prostaglandin receptor in mouse ovaries, and that activation of this prostaglandin receptor is an essential requirement in the action of luteinizing hormone to stimulate adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate formation and steroidogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1599053831,"Abstract 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate phosphatase has been purified from human red blood cells. It has been separated from phosphoglycerate mutase and acid phosphatase. The reaction catalyzed is 2,3-PGA + H2O → 3-PGA + Pi. In the absence of activators, 1 mµmole of substrate can be converted to products per min at 37° by enzyme from 1 ml of packed cells. The activity is increased by certain anions. There is activation by chloride or phosphate individually, which is enhanced by the simultaneous presence of both anions. In the presence of 0.1 m chloride, phosphate activates with a Ka of 0.7 mm. Fluoride or bromide, but not iodide, and bicarbonate can substitute for chloride. Anions that can substitute for phosphate and activate in the presence of chloride include arsenate, fluorophosphate, and sulfite. The most potent activator found is glycolate-2-P which can give a 1600-fold stimulation. In the presence of this activator, chloride is an inhibitor with respect to glycolate-2-P. Phosphate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to glycolate-2-P and the inhibition is related to the square of the phosphate concentration. The monophosphoglycerates are competitive inhibitors with respect to phosphate with enzyme activated by phosphate and chloride with a Ki of 3 µm. Monophosphoglycerates are competitive with respect to glycolate-2-P with enzyme activated by glycolate-2-P and chloride with a Ki of 2 µm. Glycine or taurine (at high pH) or pyrophosphate are activators in the presence of which there is inhibition by chloride. The Km of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate depends on the conditions of activation, varying from 0.08 µm with phosphate and 0.1 m chloride activation to 25 µm with glycolate-2-P and 0.1 m chloride. The apparent Vmax varies over a 500-fold range. Phosphoglycerate increases the Km of 2,3-PGA and inhibits with a Ki of 6 µm. The maximal velocity of the enzyme is obtained at pH 6.4 with either phosphate and chloride or glycolate-2-P as activators. With fluorophosphate and chloride, the optimum rate is at pH 6. It is suggested that the phosphate and phosphoglycerate levels are important for determining the rate of hydrolysis of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the human red blood cell."
https://openalex.org/W2151419098,"Abstract The aldehyde dehydrogenases from livers of the inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and the F1 generation of the cross between these strains (C57BL/6J x DBA/2J) have been purified over 60-fold. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity is not present in the purified enzyme preparation. Enzyme preparations from both strains and from the F1 cross specifically require NAD but can oxidize a variety of aldehyde substrates. Results obtained previously, using a crude liver homogenate as enzyme source and indoleacetaldehyde as substrate, demonstrate a 2- to 3-fold greater aldehyde-oxidizing capacity in the liver extracts of the C57BL/6J strain compared to similar extracts from the DBA/2J mice. Mice of the former strain prefer a 10% solution of alcohol to water, whereas DBA/2J mice avoid alcohol in this preference test. F1 generation mice are intermediate to the parents with regard to alcohol preference and aldehyde-oxidizing capacity. The purified enzymes from the two inbred sources are indistinguishable as determined by disc gel electrophoresis, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration criteria. Nevertheless, the aldehyde dehydrogenases of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice exhibit 2- to 3-fold differences in the Michaelis constants of aldehyde substrates. Reaction velocity differences between the two enzyme preparations are particularly apparent when acetaldehyde is the substrate. The C57BL/6J aldehyde dehydrogenase is activated by 10-6 m acetaldehyde to a reaction velocity greater than 2 times its original value, whereas the DBA/2J aldehyde dehydrogenase exhibits substrate activation only above 10-3 m acetaldehyde. Finally, it has been demonstrated by chromatographic analysis that, following intraperitoneal ethanol injection, acetaldehyde accumulates in the blood of DBA/2J mice to a greater extent than it does in C57BL/6J mice. This observation lends support to the possibility that the lower aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of the DBA/2J mice results in an acetaldehyde-induced avoidance of ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1538372858,"Abstract Crude ovine hypothalamic extract in vitro increased the formation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) by rat anterior pituitary glands but not by posterior pituitary, pineal, adrenal, or liver. Epinephrine (30 µg per ml) stimulated formation of cyclic AMP in pineal gland and adrenocorticotropic hormone- (8 i.u. per ml) and glucagon-(100 µg per ml) augmented cyclic AMP in adrenal and liver, respectively. Hypothalamic extract also rapidly increased adenyl cyclase activity in homogenates of rat anterior pituitary glands. Although theophylline (10-2 m) inhibited phosphodiesterase activity in anterior pituitary homogenates, hypothalamic extract had no effect on this enzyme either in the presence or absence of theophylline. Theophylline addition increased the concentration of anterior pituitary cyclic AMP and potentiated effects of hypothalamic extract on this parameter, but had no effects on luteinizing hormone release. Hypothalamic extract did not inhibit ATPase activity. Exclusion of Ca2+ from the buffer did not diminish stimulation of cyclic AMP formation by hypothalamic extract. Anterior pituitary cyclic AMP was not increased by high K+ concentration in the incubation medium. Prostaglandins added in vitro also increased formation of cyclic AMP by anterior pituitary, but there was marked variation in their potency. Prostaglandin E1 was the most effective and F1α the least. However, none of the prostaglandins increased luteinizing hormone release in vitro. Hypothalamic extract and prostaglandin E1 stimulated 3H-adenine incorporation into 3H-labeled cyclic AMP in intact anterior pituitary glands. NaF did not increase 3H-adenine incorporation into 3H-labeled cyclic AMP in intact pituitary in vitro, although it markedly increased adenyl cyclase activity in pituitary homogenates. Epinephrine (200 µg per ml) did not modify the stimulation by hypothalamic extract of either cyclic AMP synthesis or luteinizing hormone release. Carbamylcholine (30 µg per ml), dopamine (30 µg per ml), serotonin (30 µg per ml), prostaglandin E1 (10 µg per ml), or histamine (30 µg per ml) added in vitro had no effect on cyclic AMP concentrations in hypothalamic fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1661952547,"Abstract Cell-free extracts from sonically disrupted Corynebacterium sp. (7E1C) oxidized n-octane to 1-octanol and octanoic acid in the presence of NADH and O2. The hydroxylating activity, assayed by direct estimation of the reaction products, was found to be concentrated in the clarified S3 suprenatant fraction after centrifugation at 144,000 x g for 2 hours. By use of mass spectrometry it was shown that molecular oxygen is incorporated into the substrate during hydroxylation. The hydroxylating enzyme system was separated into two protein fractions, both of which were required for activity. One fraction, the S3(25–40)D, which precipitated between 25 and 40% ammonium sulfate saturation, appeared particulate and contained cytochrome P-450. The participation of this hemoprotein in n-octane hydroxylation was established by inhibition, induction, and spectral studies. The S3(60–100)D fraction, which precipitated between 60 and 100% ammonium sulfate saturation, was soluble, contained flavoprotein, and was functional in reducing cytochrome P-450 or cytochrome c in the presence of NADH. A tentative scheme for n-octane hydroxylation in the Corynebacterium 7E1C system is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1584639074,"Abstract The transformation of phosphorylase b to a catalyzed by phosphorylase kinase as well as the cyclic 3',5'-AMP-dependent activation of skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase have been shown in vitro to involve phosphorylation of serine residues in the enzymes. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine whether phosphorylation of these proteins occurred in vivo following the administration of epinephrine. 32P-Pi was given to rabbits to label muscle phosphate compounds. Two hours later leg muscle was rapidly frozen 60 sec after the administration of epinephrine. Phosphorylase b purified from the muscle contained no 32P. The epinephrine-induced formation of phosphorylase a was associated with incorporation of 32P, (0.8 mole per 105 g of enzyme) all of which could be removed by alkaline hydrolysis or incubation with phosphorylase phosphatase. The specific activity of this phosphate corresponded to that of the γ-phosphate of the muscle ATP. No incorporation of 32P into the pyridoxal phosphate prosthetic group of phosphorylase was observed in vivo. In contrast, phosphorylase kinase was found to contain bound phosphate irrespective of its degree of activation. It contained 0.4 to 0.8 mole of phosphate per 105 g of protein that could be hydrolyzed by alkali but not by mild acid. This phosphate exchanged in vivo with 32P in the absence of epinephrine, attaining a specific activity greater than that of the γ-phosphate of muscle ATP 1½ to 3 hours after administration of 32P-Pi to the animals. This suggested that phosphorylase kinase was exposed to a different pool of muscle 32P than phosphorylase. Despite an increase in cyclic 3',5'-AMP concentration and kinase activity in the muscle, epinephrine caused no measurable increase in phosphate incorporation into the enzyme. This may be caused by difficulties in detecting small changes in the degree of phosphorylation during activation in vivo of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1544249418,"Abstract Adrenocorticotropic hormone administration to guinea pigs resulted in an increase in the content of DNA of adrenal glands and the stimulation of the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into nuclear DNA thereby indicating an induction of DNA synthesis. The activities of thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase of adrenal glands were concomitantly increased following adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment. The response in time of both enzymes to hormone administration was quite similar. No differences were detected in the properties of DNA polymerase of adrenal glands from adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated and control animals. Hormone treatment resulted in the stimulation of DNA polymerase activity in both the nuclear and supernatant fractions. The DNA polymerase activity of nuclei utilizes preferentially native DNA as the primer, whereas the enzyme activity in the supernatant fraction prefers denatured DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1553363384,"Abstract The metabolism and mechanism of action of 4-pentenoic acid has been investigated in isolated perfused rat livers. 4-Pentenoic acid (up to 10 µmoles per g of liver) was rapidly metabolized with the consumption of slightly more than 2 g atoms of oxygen per mole of 4-pentenoic acid added and production of 0.5 mole of ketone bodies. Addition of larger amounts of 4-pentenoic acid resulted in an incomplete metabolism. Tissue levels of coenzyme A and carnitine fell by 83% and 70%, respectively, within 1 min after 4-pentenoic acid addition. Acid-soluble acyl-CoA and acylcarnitine compounds increased rapidly, but subsequently declined so that after 45 min most of the bound CoA and carnitine derivatives were present in the perchloric acid-insoluble form. Acetyl-CoA levels initially fell moderately whereas acetylcarnitine levels showed a transient rise during the period of rapid ketone body production. These results are in accordance with previous suggestions in the literature that 4-pentenoic acid is first converted to 4-pentenyl-CoA which then undergoes one step of β oxidation with the production of acetyl-CoA, acrylyl-CoA, and their carnitine derivatives. Acrylyl-CoA probably undergoes further metabolism since the amount of 4-pentenoic acid metabolized is far greater than the CoA and carnitine contents of the liver. Metabolism of 4-pentenoic acid was associated with inhibitions of both long and short chain fatty acid oxidation, pyruvate oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. The severity of the inhibitions depended on the duration of perfusion and the concentration of 4-pentenoic acid. Pyruvate dehydrogenase was more sensitive to inhibition than β oxidation. The inhibitory effects of 4-pentenoic acid were probably caused partly by lack of intramitochondrial CoA, and partly by direct inhibitory effects of acrylyl-CoA at the enzyme active site. Inhibition of the citric acid cycle occurred after prolonged perfusion with relatively high concentrations of 4-pentenoic acid, as evidenced by a fall of oxygen consumption, a low ATP:ADP ratio, and decreased levels of malate, acetyl-CoA, citrate, and glutamate. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate occurred prior to the fall of the ATP:ADP ratio. A crossover site was identified at the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase step within 1 min of 4-pentenoic acid addition. This was associated with a marked oxidation of the NAD+ systems in both mitochondria and cytosol, and with a 20% fall of acetyl-CoA. After perfusion of livers for 30 min with 2 mm 4-pentenoic acid, gluconeogenesis was inhibited by 90%, acetyl-CoA levels were 15% of control, and a crossover site occurred between pyruvate and P-enolpyruvate. Calculations of the distribution of malate and oxalacetate showed that 4-pentenoic acid produced a 4-fold fall of the mitochondrial oxalacetate concentration and a 2-fold increase in the cytosol. Most of the decrease of total tissue malate occurred in the mitochondrial compartment, so that the large malate gradient from mitochondria to cytosol observed in control livers was abolished. The inhibitory effects of 4-pentenoic acid on gluconeogenesis are interpreted in terms of altered allosteric control of pyruvate carboxylase and diminished rate of production and transport of reducing equivalents from mitochondria to cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2083700427,"Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate and theophylline hyperpolarize smooth muscle of rabbit main pulmonary artery in low concentrations of potassium (1 millimole per liter) but do not have a significant effect on the membrane potential in the presence of high concentrations of potassium (10 millimoles per liter). The dependence of the hyperpolarizing effect on a low external concentration of potassium is similar to that observed with isoproterenol. Prior treatment with theophylline potentiated the hyperpolarizing action of isoproterenol. These findings are compatible with the assumption that potassium-dependent, beta-adrenergic hyperpolarization is mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1605221391,"Abstract Citrate synthase (citrate oxaloacetate-lyase (CoA-acetylating), EC 4.1.3.7) is very active in Rhodopseudomonas capulata, a nonsulfur purple bacterium. This activity varies greatly from carbon source to carbon source. The highest specific activity for this enzyme was obtained in acetate and acetate-bicarbonate-grown cells (1.7 to 1.8 µmoles per mg of protein-min). Citrate synthase activity was 2-fold greater in cells grown aerobically in the dark than in cells grown semiananaerobically in the light, when either malate or pyruvate was the carbon source. The specific activities of this enzyme from glucose dark-grown and light-grown cells, and from pyruvate dark-grown cells were similar, and they were about one-half the specific activity of the enzyme from acetate-grown cells. Citrate synthase in this organism was found to be a regulatory enzyme. DPNH was a strong inhibitor of the enzyme and AMP was found to relieve this inhibition. DPNH, at 0.1 mm, increased the S0.5 value and the n value (Hill constant) for acetyl-CoA. It also increased the S0.5 value but did not change the n value for oxalacetate. Increasing amounts of DPNH increased the n values for AMP, the deinhibitor. AMP, 0.46 mm, in the presence of DPNH, restored the S0.5 and the n values for acetyl-CoA to those obtained in the absence of effector molecules. AMP (0.46 mm) alone did not affect these values. Thus, AMP acts strictly as a deinhibitor of the DPNH effect with respect to acetyl-CoA. AMP, in the presence or absence of DPNH, decreased the S0.5 value and the n value for oxalacetate acting here both as a deinhibitor and as an activator. These results suggest that citrate synthase activity in R. capsulata is modulated both by the energy charge and the reducing state of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1680375958,The highlights of a year when microorganisms have proved more productive than ever for studying the genetic apparatus of cells have been the isolation and synthesis of DNA genes and the sequencing of RNA phage genes. First steps have been taken towards characterizing the enzymes which synthesize DNA and degrade RNA in bacterial cells. Protein synthesis in mammals is initiated in a way similar to bacteria; this supports the idea that the mechanisms of heredity are universal even in their details. A breakthrough in understanding the action of RNA tumour viruses has been the finding that they reverse the central dogma of molecular biology by directing synthesis of DNA.
https://openalex.org/W1967935310,"By competition with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), commonly occurring intracellular proteins, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and albumin, can protect LDH-1 and LDH-5 from inhibition and ternary complex formation with NAD and pyruvate. The existence of intracellular proteins that compete with LDH for NAD renders unphysiological a model for estimating the extent of intracellular LDH inhibition based on incubations of only LDH, NAD, and pyruvate."

https://openalex.org/W1482962035,"Abstract A previously undetected pink copper protein has been isolated from human erythrocytes and purified by chromatographic procedures. The purified protein sedimented as a single symmetrical peak in the ultracentrifuge but minor impurities were detected by polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weight was calculated to be approximately 32,000 by both Bio-Gel P-60 chromatography and sedimentation velocity centrifugation. The presence of cupric ions was established by reaction with 2,2'-biquinoline and diethyldithiocarbamate. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated the presence of cupric ion in an environment of tetragonal symmetry. The visible spectrum, with absorbance maxima located at 372, 503, and 760 mµ, disappeared upon reduction of the protein with sodium dithionite or cysteine. These spectral properties are similar to those of a number of the amine oxidases and the fluorescence spectra of the oxidized and reduced forms suggested that the protein contains an additional chromophoric group, possibly pyridoxal. Studies of the reaction of the protein with phenylhydrazine and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate further suggested the close proximity of this group and the cupric ion. The pink copper protein exhibited no activity in assays for amine oxidases, δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydrase, lipoyl dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, dichloroindophenol reductase, or porphobilinogen deaminase. The pink copper protein was distinguished from erythrocuprein by its spectral, electrophoretic, and chromatographic properties and by its inability to catalyze the dismutation of the superoxide anion."

https://openalex.org/W1514146495,"Abstract A series of experiments was performed to test the proposal of others that the oxidation of ethanol to acetate is NAD+-linked, and that, when transferred into the mitochondria, the cytoplasmic reducing equivalents produced during ethanol oxidation inhibit the oxidation of glucogenic precursors required for the formation of P-enolpyruvate. Particulate-free dialyzed extracts of rabbit livers oxidized various concentrations of ethanol to acetate with experimental ratios of the increase in NADH to that of acetate of 2.02 to 2.19. Although other hepatic enzymes known to oxidize aldehydes were active in these preparations, there was no measurable disappearance of ethanol not accounted for by net reduction of NAD+ to NADH and net production of acetate. These data are taken to indicate that the oxidation of ethanol to acetate by the liver is predominantly, if not exclusively, NAD+-linked. With β-hydroxybutyrate as source of competing reducing equivalents, simulating the transfer of reducing equivalents into the mitochondria during ethanol oxidation, P-enolpyruvate synthesis from α-ketoglutarate or glutamate by rabbit liver mitochondria was tested under conditions in which electron transfer was rate-limiting (with 0 to 20 µm dinitrophenol), or in which electron transfer was not limiting (with 50 µm dinitrophenol). In the presence of 0 to 20 µm dinitrophenol, β-hydroxybutyrate had little effect on respiratory rate, but decreased the synthesis of P-enolpyruvate from α-ketoglutarate or glutamate, and increased the mitochondrial NADH:NAD+ ratio. With 50 µm dinitrophenol, β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation increased respiration but had no effect on P-enolpyruvate synthesis or the NADH:NAD+ ratio. The data presented are taken to support our previously stated hypothesis that the rate of gluconeogenesis by the liver is regulated to a large degree by the rate of flow of carbon from glucogenic amino acids into and through the citric acid cycle."

The 1-magnesium pyrophosphoryl and 5-phosphoryl moieties are the most important points of binding, and the main role of the ribofuranose ring seems to be to keep these anionic groups at a critical distance. The enzyme is inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, but this is prevented by magnesium phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate.

https://openalex.org/W1549326757,"Abstract Acetyl phosphate or p-nitrophenyl acetate acetylates a specific cysteine residue in the active center of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase crystallized from rabbit muscle. This reaction occurs more easily with the enzyme from rabbit than from yeast. At pH 7.0 and 0° the cysteine residue is readily acetylated and forms a common intermediate in the dehydrogenase, transferase, and esterase reactions. On warming or raising the pH to 8.5, the acetyl groups migrate from the cysteine to a specific lysine moiety by a S—N transfer reaction. Three to 4 cysteine or lysine residues can be acetylated per molecule of rabbit muscle dehydrogenase (mol wt 140,000). The distribution of the acetyl group between these 2 residues is affected by the pH, substrate concentration, and time of incubation. A more specifically and completely labeled N-acetyl enzyme can be prepared with acetyl phosphate than with p-nitrophenyl acetate. N-Acetylation of the enzyme impairs DPN binding and, depending on the assay conditions, produces varying degrees of inhibition of the dehydrogenase activity. On the other hand, DPN inhibits the N-acetylation of the enzyme. When DPN is added to the N-acetylated dehydrogenase, the coenzyme protects against progressive inactivation of the protein with time."
https://openalex.org/W1594487262,"Abstract Rabbits immunized with partially purified guinea pig serum and guinea pig liver l-asparaginases produced precipitating antibodies to the homologous enzymes. Antisera to guinea pig serum l-asparaginase precipitated the guinea pig liver and agouti serum l-asparaginases but did not cross-react with Escherichia coli B l-asparaginase. Conversely, antisera to guinea pig liver l-asparaginase precipitated the guinea pig serum and agouti serum l-asparaginases but also had no effect on the E. coli B enzyme. The l-asparaginase-antibody precipitates retained varying degrees of the original enzymatic activity, depending on the source of the enzyme as well as on the antiserum used for the precipitation. The ability of guinea pig serum and liver l-asparaginases to cross-react with the heterologous antibodies was utilized to obtain the corresponding heterologous l-asparaginase-antibody precipitates. Separation and reactions of the insoluble l-asparaginase-antibody complexes are described. Immunization of rabbits with l-asparaginase-antibody precipitates increased the production of the l-asparaginase-precipitating antibodies. The resulting specific, secondary antisera were used for the precipitation of the heterologous l-asparaginases. Further enhancement of the antibody titers was observed on injection of the guinea pig serum l-asparaginase-antibody precipitates prepared with the secondary antisera. The insoluble guinea pig l-asparaginase-antibody complexes were solubilized by digestion with papain and purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The solubilized complexes obtained with the tertiary antisera exhibited a single protein band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were as effective against Gardner lymphosarcoma as the original guinea pig serum l-asparaginase."
