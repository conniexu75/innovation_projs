https://openalex.org/W2127846911,"We have examined the endocytic trafficking of epitope-tagged δ and µ opioid receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. These receptors are activated by peptide agonists (enkephalins) as well as by the alkaloid agonist drugs etorphine and morphine. Enkephalins and etorphine cause opioid receptors to internalize rapidly (t1/2 ~ 6 min) by a mechanism similar to that utilized by a number of other classes of receptor, as indicated by localization of internalized opioid receptors in transferrin-containing endosomes and inhibition of opioid receptor internalization by hypertonic media. Remarkably, morphine does not stimulate the rapid internalization of either δ or µ opioid receptors, even at high concentrations that strongly inhibit adenylyl cyclase. These data indicate that agonist ligands, which have similar effects on receptor-mediated signaling, can have dramatically different effects on the intracellular trafficking of a G protein-coupled receptor.

These data indicate that agonist ligands, which have similar effects on receptor-mediated signaling, can have dramatically different effects on the intracellular trafficking of a G protein-coupled receptor. Opioid receptors constitute a class of G protein-coupled receptors that mediate the effects of endogenously produced opioid peptides in the central and peripheral nervous systems. An interesting feature of these receptors is that they are activated both by native peptides and by structurally distinct non-peptide alkaloid ligands (1Hughes J. Kosterlitz H.W. Br. Med. Bull. 1977; 33: 157-161Google Scholar). Following activation, opioid receptors are regulated by multiple mechanisms, which modulate the functional plasticity of the endogenous opioid system and contribute to the development of opiate tolerance and dependence (2Nestler E.J.

Previous studies have described two distinguishable processes of opioid receptor regulation, termed desensitization and down-regulation (3Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol.

Both desensitization and down-regulation of opioid receptors are stimulated by peptide and alkaloid agonists (4Sharma S.K. Klee W.A. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3365-3369Google Scholar, 6Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4096-4104Google Scholar). However, individual agonists may have substantially different effects on the rapid regulation of opioid receptors (10von Zastrow M. Keith D.E. Zaki P. Evans C.J. Regul.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1636-1645Google Scholar). We have observed that opioid receptors are regulated by a process of rapid internalization that exhibits a remarkable degree of agonist specificity not observed previously in studies of the intracellular trafficking of other receptors. cDNAs encoding murine δ (13Evans C.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15877-15883Google Scholar) opioid receptors were epitope-tagged in the amino-terminal extracellular domain utilizing a shuttle vector containing a signal-FLAG cassette (kindly provided by Drs. Jeff Reagan and Brian Kobilka) (15Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Google Scholar) and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for transfection. The structure of each mutant cDNA was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.).

Berg P. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 270-279Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were isolated following neomycin selection (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (17von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Google Scholar), and saturation binding of [3H]diprenorphine (see below) was used to estimate the level of receptor expression in individual clones. human embryonic kidney [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin fluorescein isothiocyanate. Approximately 200,000 cells (determined by counting in a hemocytometer) were placed in polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson) with 0.3-180 nM [3H]diprenorphine (Amersham Corp.) in a total volume of 100 µl as described (11von Zastrow M. Keith D.J. Evans C.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 166-172Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 60 min, the mixture was harvested quickly in a Brandel M24RS harvester using GT100 GF/B glass filters and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After drying, the filters were counted in a Beckman LS1600 scintillation counter using CytoScint (ICN). Nonspecific binding, defined by performing radioligand binding in the presence of 10 µM diprenorphine, represented less than 15% of total binding in all experiments. 293SFDOR and 293SFMOR cells were incubated with 1 mM isobutyl methylxanthine (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by a further 5-min incubation in 5 µM forskolin (Sigma) and varying amounts of opioid ligands (13Evans C.J. Keith D.J. Morrison H. Magendzo K. Edwards R.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1952-1955Google Scholar). The samples were assayed with a cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (DPC, Inc., Los Angeles, CA). Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed using 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained as described (18von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Google Scholar). For colocalization of opioid receptors with endocytosed transferrin, 293-SFDOR or 293-SFMOR cells were incubated with 25 nM transferrin-Texas Red (Molecular Probes) in serum-free medium for 30 min prior to treatment with various ligands and fixation. Subsequently, receptor localization was visualized by staining with M1 antibody followed by goat anti-mouse FITC conjugate. Localization of both transferrin and opioid receptor immunoreactivity in the same specimens was accomplished using dual color confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC-1000) using dual excitation (to minimize bleed-through) and a Zeiss 100× NA1.3 objective. Imaging of single-labeled specimens confirmed negligible bleed-through between channels. Epitope-tagged SF-DOR and SF-MOR cells were treated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone or with opioid ligand for the times indicated. Cells were then chilled and stained on ice with anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal (10 µg/ml) in 50% fetal bovine serum/phosphate-buffered saline, then with FITC conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (10 µg/ml), and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Inc.). Live cells were gated by light scatter or exclusion of propidium iodide, and 10,000 cells were acquired for each time point. Mean fluorescence of all live cells, minus mean fluorescence of cells stained only with FITC-conjugated second antibody, was used for calculations (19Schmid I. Schmid P. Giorgi J.V. Cytometry. 1988; 9: 533-538Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting the agonist-induced reduction in surface receptor fluorescence to a single exponential function utilizing a linear least-squares algorithm. Each time point was collected in triplicate in each experiment, and kinetic parameters were calculated by averaging the results between five separate experiments. Transiently and stably transfected HEK293 cells were used as a model system to study the functional properties and intracellular trafficking of cloned opioid receptors. Murine δ and µ opioid receptors were examined, because both receptors bind and are activated by opioid peptides (enkephalins) as well as by the alkaloid agonists morphine and etorphine. In contrast, κ and ORL-1 receptors exhibit negligible affinity for morphine and bind enkephalins with extremely low affinity (20Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K. Yu L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334Google Scholar, 21Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma F.J. Civelli O. Science. 1995; 270: 792-794Google Scholar). Stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing tagged δ or µ receptors exhibited readily detectable specific binding of [3H]diprenorphine, while untransfected cells exhibited no detectable specific binding of this radioligand. Expression levels in transfected HEK293 cells typically ranged from 100,000 to 2,000,000 receptors/cell, as determined by saturation binding analysis. Clones of stably transfected cells expressing δ (293SFDOR) or µ (293SFMOR) receptors with Bmax values of 148,000 and 1,500,000 receptors/cell, respectively (Table I A), were selected for further characterization of the functional properties of epitope-tagged opioid receptors over this range of expression levels.Table I.Radioligand binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by epitope-tagged opioid receptorsA293-SF-DOR293-SF-MORKd of diprenorphine (nM)8.4921.9Bmax (picomoles of [3H]DPN bound per 106 cells)0.2462.50Number of receptors/cell148,0001,500,000B DrugaDPDPE, [D-penicillamine 2,5]enkephalin.IC50 for cyclase293-SF-DOR293-SF-MORDADLE8.72 nM7.70 nMEtorphine1.76 nM0.37 nMMorphine9.2 µM16.47 nMDPDPE4.22 nMNDbND, not determined.DAMGOND4.81 nMa DPDPE, [D-penicillamine 2,5]enkephalin.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Etorphine, morphine, and enkephalin analogs (but not the opiate antagonist naloxone) caused opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in 293SFDOR and 293SFMOR cells, while no inhibition was observed in nontransfected cells. (Table I B). The different potency of morphine at the δ, compared with the µ, receptor is consistent with the pharmacology of the wild-type opioid receptors (13Evans C.J. Keith D.J. Morrison H. Magendzo K. Edwards R.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1952-1955Google Scholar, 14Kaufman D.L. Keith D.E.J. Anton B. Tian J. Magendzo K. Newman D. Tran T.H. Lee D.S. Wen C. Xia Y.R. J. Biol.

Takeda J. Reisine T. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6736-6740Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged δ receptors were localized primarily in the plasma membrane of untreated cells (Fig. 1a). Within 10 min after the addition of the enkephalin analog DADLE, δ receptors redistributed from the plasma membrane to a population of intracellular vesicles. Surprisingly, in contrast to the effects of these agonists on promoting the rapid internalization of opioid receptors, the alkaloid agonist morphine failed to induce detectable redistribution of δ receptors from the plasma membrane (Fig. 1c). Because morphine binds to the δ receptor with relatively low affinity compared with etorphine and enkephalins, and morphine has been suggested to have partial agonist activity at the δ receptor (6Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4096-4104Google Scholar, 20Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K. Yu L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334Google Scholar), we questioned whether the failure of morphine to stimulate rapid internalization of opioid receptors could be explained solely by these pharmacological differences. Morphine binds to the µ receptor with equal or higher affinity than etorphine or enkephalin (14Kaufman D.L. Keith D.E.J. Anton B. Tian J. Magendzo K. Newman D. Tran T.H. Lee D.S. Wen C. Xia Y.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15877-15883Google Scholar, 20Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K. Yu L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334Google Scholar, 23Wang J.B. Johnson P.S. Persico A.M. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Uhl G.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 217-222Google Scholar), and morphine has similar intrinsic efficacy as the other agonist ligands tested (24Traynor J.R. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 848-854Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged µ opioid receptors were localized in the plasma membrane of untreated 293SFMOR cells (Fig. 2a) and internalized rapidly following activation by the enkephalin analog DAMGO or alkaloid agonist etorphine (Fig. 2, b and c, respectively). However, as observed with δ receptors, no internalization of µ receptors was observed under the same conditions in morphine-treated cells (Fig. 2d). Morphine failed to cause detectable rapid internalization of µ receptors at all concentrations tested even up to 100 µM, a dose nearly 10,000-fold higher than required to cause maximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Table I) and 100,000-fold higher than the Kd for binding to the µ receptor (20Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K. Yu L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334Google Scholar). Fluorescence flow cytometry was used to measure ligand-dependent changes in the number of receptors present in the plasma membrane of 293SFDOR and 293SFMOR cells. Etorphine caused rapid internalization of opioid receptors as indicated by a ligand-induced reduction in the fluorescence intensity of antibody-labeled cells. Both δ and µ receptors were internalized with similar kinetics (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively, open circles), and the agonist-induced internalization of opioid receptors was blocked by the opiate antagonist naloxone (open triangles). The t1/2 for opioid receptor internalization calculated by fitting these data to a first order process was 5.9 ± 2.2 min in 293-SFDOR cells and 6.0 ± 1.7 min in 293-SFMOR cells (mean ± S.E., n = 5). No internalization of either δ or µ receptors was observed in the presence of saturating concentrations of morphine (closed circles). To determine whether opioid receptors activated by etorphine or enkephalin are endocytosed via a similar pathway as certain other G-protein-coupled receptors (17von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Google Scholar, 25Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 177-186Google Scholar, 26Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Google Scholar), the subcellular localization of opioid receptors was compared with that of endocytosed transferrin by dual label fluorescence microscopy. In cells treated with etorphine (or DADLE, not shown), dramatically reduced receptor staining was observed in the plasma membrane, and opioid receptors were observed in numerous intracellular vesicles, many of which could be identified as endosomes by colocalization with endocytosed transferrin (Fig. 4a, lower panels). Ligand-dependent internalization of receptors was examined in culture medium supplemented with 0.35 M sucrose to produce mildly hypertonic conditions, which inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis (27Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Google Scholar). Internalization of δ and µ opioid receptors was strongly inhibited under these conditions (Fig. 4b, left and right panels, respectively; compare with lower left panel in Fig. 4a for representative internalization in normal medium), further suggesting that the mechanism of opioid receptor endocytosis is similar to that mediating rapid internalization of certain other receptors. To compare the process of rapid internalization described in this study with the previously described process of receptor down-regulation, ligand-induced down-regulation of opioid receptors was measured by a saturation radioligand binding assay using [3H]diprenorphine in cell lysates (3Law P.-Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 72: 1-4Google Scholar). Essentially no down-regulation of opioid receptors (<5% reduction in specific binding of diprenorphine) was observed in 293SFDOR or 293SFMOR cells treated with 500 nM etorphine for 30 min, while ≥40% of opioid receptors are internalized with a t1/2 of ~6 min under the same conditions (Fig. 3). In chronically treated cells (18 h), however, both etorphine and morphine caused significant down-regulation of both δ and µ receptors (41 ± 14% and 25 ± 11%, respectively, n = 4). In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that that both δ and µ opioid receptors are internalized within several minutes following activation by certain agonists, including native peptide ligands (enkephalins) and the alkaloid agonist drug etorphine, while morphine is an agonist ligand which has the remarkable ability to strongly activate opioid receptor signaling without stimulating the process of rapid internalization. Morphine has been observed to be a full agonist of µ receptors in membranes prepared from cultured neuroblastoma cells (24Traynor J.R. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 848-854Google Scholar), although there is not general consensus that morphine is a full µ agonist in all studies (28Smith C.F.C. Rance M.J. Life Sci. 1983; 33 (Suppl. I): 327-330Google Scholar). Other G protein-coupled receptors have been observed to internalize following activation by both full and partial agonists (29Jasper J.R. Insel P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 119-130Google Scholar). The present findings suggest that different agonists can induce different activated states of receptor that similarly activate heterotrimeric G proteins but differ significantly in their intracellular trafficking. This possibility is consistent with mutational studies indicating, conversely, that subtle changes in opioid receptor structure differentially affect the binding of individual agonist ligands (30Metzger T.G. Ferguson D.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 1-4Google Scholar, 31Fukuda K. Terasako K. Kato S. Mori K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 177-181Google Scholar, 32Surratt C.K. Johnson P.S. Moriwaki A. Seidleck B.K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23055-23058Google Scholar). The different effects of agonists, which are closely similar in structure (i.e. morphine and etorphine), suggest that conformational differences required to mediate the observed differences in rapid internalization might be quite subtle. The present data are of general significance to the cell biology of G protein-coupled receptors and and may have important implications for understanding molecular mechanisms of opiate drug action and addiction.

https://openalex.org/W1975515113,"Detection of 3-nitrotyrosine has served as an in vivo marker for the production of the cytotoxic species peroxynitrite (ONOO−). We show here that reaction of nitrite (NO−2), the autoxidation product of nitric oxide (·NO), with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) forms reactive intermediate species that are also capable of nitrating phenolic substrates such as tyrosine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, with maximum yields obtained at physiological pH. Monitoring the reaction of NO−2 with HOCl by continuous flow photodiode array spectrophotometry indicates the formation of a transient species with spectral characteristics similar to those of nitryl chloride (Cl-NO2). Reaction of synthetic Cl-NO2 with N-acetyl-L-tyrosine results in the formation of 3-chlorotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine in ratios that are similar to those obtained by the NO−2/HOCl reaction (4:1). Tyrosine residues in bovine serum albumin are also nitrated and chlorinated by NO−2/HOCl and synthetic Cl-NO2. The reaction of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine with NO−2/HOCl or authentic Cl-NO2 also produces dityrosine, suggesting that free radical intermediates are involved in the reaction mechanism. Our data indicate that while chlorination reactions of Cl-NO2 are mediated by direct electrophilic addition to the aromatic ring, a free radical mechanism appears to be operative in nitrations mediated by NO−2/HOCl or Cl-NO2, probably involving the combination of nitrogen dioxide (·NO2) and tyrosyl radical. We propose that NO−2 reacts with HOCl by Cl+ transfer to form both cis- and trans-chlorine nitrite (Cl-ONO) and Cl-NO2 as intermediates that modify tyrosine by either direct reaction or after decomposition to reactive free and solvent-caged Cl· and ·NO2 as reactive species. Formation of Cl-NO2 and/or Cl-ONO in vivo may represent previously unrecognized mediators of inflammation-mediated protein modification and tissue injury, and offers an additional mechanism of tyrosine nitration independent of ONOO−.

Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Google Scholar). ·NO is an important endogenous mediator in such diverse biochemical and physiological processes as neurotransmission, smooth muscle relaxation, platelet aggregation and adhesion, macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity, and learning and memory (2Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 3Schmidt H.H. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Google Scholar). Although basal levels of free ·NO are normally quite low (nanomolar), local ·NO concentrations have been shown to increase to levels ranging from 4 to 30 µM under pathologic conditions (4Hooper D.C. Ohnishi S.T. Kean R. Numagami Y. Dietzschold B. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5312-5316Google Scholar, 5Malinski T. Zhang Z.G. Chopp M. J. Cerebral Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 355-358Google Scholar).·NO reacts at a near diffusion-controlled rate with superoxide (O2) (k = 6.7 × 109M−1 s−1) (6Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Google Scholar) to form the cytotoxic species peroxynitrite (ONOO−). The formation of ONOO− is thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the observed toxicity associated with ·NO (7Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Google Scholar, 8Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z.-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.-S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Google Scholar). At physiological pH the protonated form of ONOO−, peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) (pKa = 6.8), is highly unstable and rapidly decomposes to nitrate (NO−3). ONOOH is thought to 1) react directly with biological molecules via a vibrationally excited intermediate (ONOOH*), 2) decompose by homolytic dissociation to form nitrogen dioxide (·NO2) and the hydroxyl radical (·OH), or 3) by heterolytic dissociation to form the nitryl cation (nitronium ion, NO+2) (reviewed in Ref. 9Pryor W.A.

ONOO−/ONOOH reacts with proteins, leading to the oxidation of cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues, and can induce protein carbonyl formation and nonspecific fragmentation (10Ischiropoulos H. Al-Mehdi A.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 279-282Google Scholar, 11Pryor W.A. Jin X. Squadrito G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11173-11177Google Scholar, 12Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M.

Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 446-451Google Scholar), neutrophils (19Carreras M.C. Pargament G.A. Catz S.D. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 65-68Google Scholar), and endothelial cells (20Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 352-359Google Scholar) have been proposed to form significant quantities of ONOO− in vitro. In fact, the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine (NO2-Tyr) in a variety of pathologic conditions in vivo, such as inflammatory lung disease (21Haddad I.Y. Pataki G. Hu P. Galliani C. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2407-2413Google Scholar), atherosclerosis (22Beckman J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biochem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Google Scholar), and rheumatoid arthritis (23Kaur H. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 9-12Google Scholar), has been attributed to ONOO− formation. However, in all of these cases direct proof for the production of ONOO− in biological systems is lacking, even though its formation in vivo is favorably predicted (24Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1995; 96: 203-206Google Scholar).Under inflammatory conditions, multiple well characterized reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced from phagocytic cells (25Miller R.A. Britigan B.E. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 39-49Google Scholar). For instance, stimulated neutrophils and macrophages produce significant levels of superoxide (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a result of the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase (26Winterbourn C.C. Das D.K. Essman W.B. Oxygen Radicals: Systemic Events and Disease Processes. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1990: 31Google Scholar). In the case of neutrophils, some of the H2O2 that is produced under these conditions is converted to the strong oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by the action of myeloperoxidase as shown in Reaction 1. H2O2+H++C1−→HOC1+H2O REACTION 1HOCl produced from activated human neutrophils has been shown to react with amines (taurine, lysine, and arginine) and tyrosine to form N-chloramines and 3-chlorotyrosine (Cl-Tyr), respectively (27Domigan N.M. Charlton T.S. Duncan M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16542-16548Google Scholar, 28Weiss S.J. Lampert M.B. Test S.T. Science. 1983; 222: 625-628Google Scholar), where the latter has been proposed to serve as a selective marker of HOCl production in vivo (29Kettle A.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 103-106Google Scholar).In addition to ROS, macrophages (30Marletta M.A. Yoon P.S. Iyengar R. Leaf C.D. Wishnok J.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8706-8711Google Scholar) and neutrophils (19Carreras M.C. Pargament G.A. Catz S.D. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 65-68Google Scholar) can also simultaneously produce large fluxes of ·NO through the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase; however, the ability of human neutrophils to produce ·NO is debated (31Miles A.M. Owens M.W. Milligan S. Johnson G.G. Fields J.Z. Ing T.S. Kottapalli V. Keshavarzian A. Grisham M.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 616-622Google Scholar). Once formed, ·NO can react with several biological targets, primarily thought to involve heme-iron, hyperreactive sulfhydryls and protein radicals (32Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Google Scholar, 33Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Bobé P. Lemaire G. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21891-21897Google Scholar, 34Eiserich J.P. Butler J. van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Google Scholar). ·NO can also react with O2 in aqueous solution to produce nitrite (NO−2) via a complex mechanism thought to involve a variety of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) including ·NO2 and dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) (35Ignarro L.J. Fukuto J.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Byrns R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8103-8107Google Scholar). In fact, NO−2 has been used as a marker of ·NO production in vitro and in vivo and has been shown to reach concentrations of up to 4 µM in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (36Farrell A.J. Blake D.R. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 1219-1222Google Scholar) and as high as 20 µM in human airway fluids (37Gaston B. Reilly J. Drazen J.M. Fackler J. Ramdev P. Arnelle D. Mullins M.E. Sugarbaker D.J. Chee C. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10957-10961Google Scholar). These RNS produced during an inflammatory response could theoretically react with a number of ROS to form various novel species. Indeed, the interaction of HOCl with ·NO or NO−2 has been proposed to form species capable of nitrosylating and nitrating organic substrates (38Koppenol W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 5-8Google Scholar, 39Kono Y. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 275-283Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to examine the potential interactions of ·NO-derived RNS with the inflammatory oxidant HOCl in an attempt to characterize more fully the various species that may be formed under complex physiological inflammatory conditions. Our results indicate that NO−2 reacts with HOCl to form an intermediate species, postulated to be nitryl chloride (Cl-NO2) and/or chlorine nitrite (Cl-ONO), that is capable of nitrating, chlorinating, and dimerizing phenolic compounds including tyrosine. We propose that the formation of Cl-NO2 and/or Cl-ONO by this reaction represents a novel mechanism of inflammation-mediated biological damage, and offers an additional or alternative mechanism of tyrosine nitration independent of ONOO− formation.DISCUSSIONAlthough the mechanisms of biomolecular damage and pathology induced by individual inflammatory oxidants are in general well characterized, an understanding of the complex interactions of ROS and RNS that are likely to occur at sites of inflammation is only just beginning to emerge. The studies reported herein show that the interactions of RNS and HOCl may be important under inflammatory conditions in vivo. We have shown that NO−2, the autoxidation product of ·NO in biological fluids, reacts with HOCl to produce a species that can nitrate, chlorinate, and dimerize biologically relevant phenolic compounds such as tyrosine, both free and within protein. The detection of NO2-Tyr in a variety of pathologic states (21Haddad I.Y. Pataki G. Hu P. Galliani C. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2407-2413Google Scholar, 22Beckman J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biochem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Google Scholar, 23Kaur H. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 9-12Google Scholar) has been used to indicate the formation of ONOO− in vivo. However, reaction of tyrosine with the products of the NO−2/HOCl reaction also forms NO2-Tyr. Hence, our results suggest that NO2-Tyr should not be regarded as a specific marker of ONOO− formation, but only as a marker of RNS.Mechanism of NO−2/HOCl ReactionIt has long been thought (48Anbar M. Taube H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 1073-1077Google Scholar) that the reaction of NO−2 with HOCl represented a classical example of an oxygen atom transfer reaction producing NO−3. NO2−+HOC1→HC1+NO3− REACTION 2However, this type of mechanism does not easily explain the nitration and chlorination reactions observed in our studies. Our data suggest a more complex mechanism involving the formation of reactive nitrating and chlorinating intermediates. One-electron oxidation of NO−2 by HOCl, producing the reactive radical species Cl· and ·NO2 is one possible pathway. Since HOCl is a poor one-electron oxidant, having an estimated one-electron reduction potential (E′0) in the range of +0.17 to +0.26 V at pH 7 (38Koppenol W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 5-8Google Scholar), it is unlikely that a one-electron oxidation mechanism contributes, since the E value for the ·NO2/NO−2 couple is approximately +1.04 V (49Wardman P. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1989; 18: 1637-1755Google Scholar). In contrast, HOCl is a strong two-electron oxidant (E′0 = +1.08 V) (38Koppenol W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 5-8Google Scholar) and would favor the conversion of NO−2 to the nitryl cation (NO+2) or an “NO+2-like” species. In addition to a direct two-electron oxidation of NO−2 by HOCl, a bimolecular substitution reaction between these two reactants could be involved. In fact, contrary to the reaction mechanism previously reported (48Anbar M. Taube H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 1073-1077Google Scholar), Johnson and Margerum (45Johnson D.W. Margerum D.W. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 4845-4851Google Scholar) have suggested that HOCl reacts with NO−2 by Cl+ transfer, rather than O atom transfer, to yield the intermediate Cl-NO2, which then hydrolyzes to NO−3.The absorbance spectrum of the product of the reaction between NO−2 and HOCl (Fig. 5B) was found to be similar to that of authentic Cl-NO2 (Fig. 5C). The spectrum of the product(s) of the NO−2/HOCl reaction is typical of alkyl nitrites (R-ONO) (50Haszeldine R.N. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.). 1953; : 2525-2527Google Scholar) and therefore could also indicate the formation of a Cl-O-bonded species. In fact, the transfer of Cl+ to the negatively charged oxygen atom in NO−2 is likely and would produce the transient intermediate species Cl-ONO. It is possible that both reactions occur (Fig. 9), the extent to which each pathway initially predominates under neutral aqueous conditions is not known. Cl-ONO can exist as both the cis- and trans-rotamers (Fig. 9), where ab initio calculations predict that the energy difference between the two rotamers is approximately 3 kcal/mol, with the cis rotamer being the more stable (51Lee T.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 111-115Google Scholar). An analogy can be drawn between Cl-ONO and HO-ONO (peroxynitrous acid), where the energy difference between cis- and trans-HO-ONO is also calculated to be approximately 3 kcal/mol (52Tsai J.-H.M. Harrison J.G. Martin J.C. Hamilton T.P. van der Woerd M. Jablonsky M.J. Beckman J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4115-4116Google Scholar). Once formed, Cl-ONO can readily isomerize to Cl-NO2 (53Tevault D.E. Smardzewski R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1977; 67: 3777-3784Google Scholar). We propose that intermediate Cl-ONO can isomerize in aqueous solution to Cl-NO2 by at least two mechanisms (Fig. 9): 1) intramolecular rearrangement of trans-Cl-ONO involving migration of the chlorine atom to the nitrogen atom forming Cl-NO2, or 2) unimolecular homolysis of the Cl-O bond in Cl-ONO to form a geminate pair of solvent-caged radicals Cl· and ·NO2, which undergo cage return to either reform Cl-ONO or by recombination to form Cl-NO2 (Fig. 9). Some of the solvent-caged Cl· and ·NO2 can escape as “free” radicals and could potentially explain, in part, the radical mechanisms involved in the nitration reactions we observed in the NO−2/HOCl reaction. Since Cl-NO2 is predicted to be 10.7 and 13.8 kcal/mol lower in energy than cis- and trans-Cl-ONO (51Lee T.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 111-115Google Scholar), respectively, the isomerization of Cl-ONO to Cl-NO2 is a favorable process that shifts the equilibrium toward Cl-NO2. Isomerization of cis Cl-ONO to Cl-NO2 is probably not likely, because the large size of the chlorine atom, which would presumably preclude the migration of the chlorine atom to the nitrogen atom and, hence, the trans-rotamer of Cl-ONO, is probably the species that isomerizes to Cl-NO2, analogous to the decomposition of trans-peroxynitrous acid (trans-HO-ONO). Whereas the isomerization of trans-HO-ONO leads to nitric acid (HO-NO2), an unreactive end product, isomerization of Cl-ONO produces another highly reactive species (Cl-NO2). Hence, Cl-ONO and the product of isomerization, Cl-NO2, may both be reactive oxidants with nitrating and chlorinating activity.Decomposition Products of Cl-NO2 as Reactive IntermediatesWe have shown that the product(s) of the reaction between NO−2 and HOCl, authentic Cl-NO2, or the NO+2 species (NO2BF4) react with tyrosine to form NO2-Tyr and dityrosine. Although none of these reactants are themselves radicals, formation of dityrosine suggests the involvement of intermediate tyrosyl radicals. The nitration of aromatic compounds by NO+2 is often thought to be a classical electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, but there is strong evidence implicating electron transfer reactions and radical intermediates in these pathways (54Perrin C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 5516-5518Google Scholar). This reaction mechanism involves electron transfer from the aromatic to NO+2, followed by radical pair collapse, and it would explain the detection of dityrosine in our studies. Hence, we are unable to distinguish between a nitration mechanism involving ·NO2 or NO+2 based solely on the formation of dityrosine. However, a divergence in the characteristics of the reaction mechanisms between NO+2 and the reactive nitrating species formed by the reaction of NO−2 with HOCl is evident in their reactions with MPA, the O-methylated derivative of HPA, a substrate incapable of forming phenoxyl radicals. Whereas NO+2 appears capable of nitrating MPA, both the product(s) of the NO−2/HOCl reaction and synthetic Cl-NO2 fail to do so. Similarly, the inability of NO−2/HOCl and Cl-NO2 to nitrate phenylalanine further argues against NO+2 as the species involved in tyrosine nitration.There is evidence suggesting that the reaction of Cl-NO2 with alkenes and aromatic compounds involves homolytic processes yielding free radical intermediates (42Shechter H. Conrad F. Daulton A.L. Kaplan R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 3052-3056Google Scholar), probably involving both Cl· and ·NO2. Collis et al. (43Collis M.J. Gintz F.P. Goddard D.R. Hebdon E.A. Minkoff G.J. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.). 1958; : 445-451Google Scholar) have found that Cl-NO2 decomposes at room temperature by homolysis to form Cl2 and ·NO2 as shown in Reaction 3, whereby these spontaneous decomposition products may be responsible, at least in part, for the chlorinating and nitrating behavior of Cl-NO2 in our experiments. We suggest that phenolic nitration mediated by the NO−2/HOCl reaction involves ·NO2. 2Cl−NO2→(2Cl·→Cl2)+(2·NO2⇌N2O4) REACTION 3While the nitration reactions we observed appear to be radical-mediated, chlorination of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine (Fig. 8) appears to be executed largely by electrophilic aromatic substitution. In general, chlorination of aromatic compounds by HOCl, tert-butyl hypochlorite, and Cl2 has been shown to be mediated by an ionic rather than a free radical mechanism (47Watson W.D. J. Org. Chem. 1974; 39: 1160-1164Google Scholar). The nearly 2-fold increase in the relative formation of the m-Cl-Phe isomer by reactions of phenylalanine with both NO−2/HOCl and Cl-NO2 (Fig. 8), however, suggests the potential contribution of a less selective mechanism of chlorination, potentially involving Cl·. An active chlorinating species common to HOCl and Cl-NO2 appears to be Cl2. In fact, the formation of Cl2 from HOCl and Cl-NO2 can be rationalized and would explain the similarities in their chlorinating ability. HOCl is in equilibrium with Cl2 in aqueous solution as shown in Reaction 4. The formation of Cl2 from Cl-NO2 has been proposed to occur by 1) the homolysis of two molecules of Cl-NO2 to form two Cl· which combine to form Cl2 (Reaction 3), and 2) the reaction of Cl-NO2 with H2O (43Collis M.J. Gintz F.P. Goddard D.R. Hebdon E.A. Minkoff G.J. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.). 1958; : 445-451Google Scholar) as shown in Reaction 5. HOC1+H++C1−⇄Cl2+H2O REACTION 4 3Cl−NO2+H2O→Cl2+NOCl+2NO3−+2H+ REACTION 5Although convincing evidence suggests an electrophilic substitution mechanism for these chlorination reactions, the possibility of a mechanism involving the addition of Cl· to the aromatic ring cannot be excluded for reactions involving Cl-NO2 or NO−2/HOCl.Direct Reactions of Cl-NO2/Cl-ONO with TyrosineThe mechanisms of chlorination and nitration discussed thus far have primarily involved species derived from the decomposition of either Cl-NO2 or Cl-ONO. However, as predicted by the stoichiometry of Reactions 3 and 5, these pathways are particularly favored when Cl-NO2 or Cl-ONO are present at high concentrations. In vivo, however, Cl-NO2 and Cl-ONO would be expected to be produced at rates that may favor the direct reaction of either species with biological substrates that are present in relative excess. In nonpolar organic solvents Cl-NO2 has been shown to be an efficient agent for the nitration of aromatic compounds of intermediate reactivity (55Price C.C. Sears C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 3276-3277Google Scholar). However, an increase either in the reactivity of the aromatic substrate (from benzene to phenol) or in the polarity of the solvent causes a marked decrease in the nitrating efficiency of Cl-NO2 and a concomitant increase in the yield of chlorinated products (56Gintz F.P. Goddard D.R. Collis M.J. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.). 1958; : 445-451Google Scholar). In fact, Obermeyer et al. (57Obermeyer A. Borrmann H. Simon A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7887-7890Google Scholar) argued against the localization of a positive charge on the “nitryl” group of Cl-NO2, where the structural characteristics of Cl-NO2 contrast those of typical stable nitryl salts (i.e., NO+2BF−4). Hence, reactions involving activated aromatic substrates such as tyrosine coupled with aqueous conditions would increase aromatic chlorination by Cl-NO2, suggesting a change from Cl−NO+2 character to a species with considerable Cl+NO−2 character. Our data suggest that Cl-NO2 has significant Cl+ character in aqueous solution, and it is this functionality of Cl-NO2 that dictates its reactivity.We propose that Cl+NO−2 can react directly with tyrosine via electron transfer to yield an intermediate radical pair (tyrosyl radical-Cl·-NO−2) (Fig. 10). Radical pair collapse of this complex leads to the rapid formation of Cl-Tyr and NO−2 (Fig. 10, reaction A), and is the major product formed by this reaction. This electron transfer-mediated reaction mechanism is analogous to the nitration of phenolic substrates by NO+2 (54Perrin C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 5516-5518Google Scholar). Dissociation of the radical pair complex and subsequent oxidation of NO−2 by Cl· (a strongly oxidizing species, E′0 of Cl·/Cl− = +2.2-2.6 V (Ref. 49Wardman P. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1989; 18: 1637-1755Google Scholar)) results in the formation of “free” tyrosyl radical and ·NO2 (Fig. 10, reaction B). Tyrosyl radical and ·NO2 can rapidly combine to yield NO2-Tyr (k = 3 × 109M−1 s−1 (Ref. 44Prütz W.A. Mönig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Google Scholar)), and dityrosine formation can be envisaged by the combination of two tyrosyl radicals (Fig. 10, reactions C and D). This proposed mechanism predicts that the yields of the various tyrosine modification products will be on the order of Cl-Tyr > NO2-Tyr > dityrosine, consistent with the data presented herein. The proposed reaction pathway also illustrates the dependence of radical intermediates in the nitration of phenolic compounds by Cl-NO2, as suggested by our data.Fig. 10Proposed mechanisms for the direct reactions of tyrosine with Cl-NO2. The direct reaction of Cl-NO2 with tyrosine proceeds by electron transfer from tyrosine to Cl+NO−2, resulting in an intermediate radical pair (tyrosyl radical-Cl·). Radical pair collapse leads to the formation of Cl-Tyr and NO−2 (A) as major products. Dissociation of the complex from the solvent cage allows Cl· to oxidize NO−2 to ·NO2 (B), which can combine with simultaneously formed “free” tyrosyl radical to yield NO2-Tyr (C). Dityrosine formation can be envisaged by the combination of two tyrosyl radicals (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since Cl-ONO is a potential transient intermediate in the formation of the reactive species Cl-NO2 (Fig. 9), part of the reactivity of NO−2/HOCl may be attributed to Cl-ONO. Analogous to a proposed mechanism of ONOOH reactivity (9Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722Google Scholar, 58Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Google Scholar), a vibrationally excited intermediate derived from trans-Cl-ONO (Cl-ONO*) may be formed during its isomerization to Cl-NO2 and contribute to nitration and chlorination of tyrosine by direct reaction. The reaction mechanisms we propose for Cl-NO2 and Cl-ONO are analogous to those recently determined for ONOOH, whereby both direct and indirect reactions with oxidizable substrates can occur (59Goldstein S. Czapski G. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 4041-4048Google Scholar). A more detailed examination of the reaction kinetics and thermodynamic considerations is necessary in order to elucidate which of the proposed mechanisms predominate.Physiological Relevance and Biological ImplicationsThe activation and accumulation of neutrophils at sites of tissue injury, leading to the formation of HOCl and other ROS/RNS, is an essential feature of inflammation. Our data suggest that the reaction of HOCl with NO−2, derived from ·NO produced by other phagocytes (30Marletta M.A. Yoon P.S. Iyengar R. Leaf C.D. Wishnok J.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8706-8711Google Scholar), endothelial cells (2Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar), or epithelial cells (37Gaston B. Reilly J.

We discovered that GSNO is an NADPH oxidizing substrate for human or calf thymus thioredoxin reductase (TR) with an apparent Km value of 60 µM and a Kcat of 0.6 × s−1. Addition of human thioredoxin (Trx) stimulated the initial NADPH oxidation rate severalfold but was accompanied by progressive inactivation of TR. Escherichia coli TR lacked activity with GSNO, but with E. coli Trx present, GSNO was reduced without inhibition of the enzyme. Chemically reduced E. coli Trx-(SH)2 was oxidized to Trx-S2 by GSNO with a rate constant of 760 M−1s−1 (7-fold faster than by GSSG) as measured by tryptophan fluorescence. Analysis of this reaction in the presence of oxymyoglobin revealed quantitative formation of metmyoglobin indicative of NO· release. Analysis of GSNO reduction demonstrated that oxidation of NADPH produced a stoichiometric amount of free GSH. These results demonstrate a homolytic cleavage mechanism of GSNO, giving rise to GSH and NO·. GSNO efficiently inhibited the protein disulfide reductase activity of the complete human or calf thymus thioredoxin systems.

Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar, 6Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E-J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Google Scholar, 7Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B.

Thus, nitrosylation of a critical Cys-residue in p21ras activates this G protein (8Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Google Scholar). In cells glutathione readily reacts with activated NO intermediates, forming the stable adduct S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) as shown in activated human neutrophils (9Gaston B. Reilly J. Drazen J.M. Fackler J. Ramdev P. Arnelle D. Mullins M.E. Sugarbaker D.J. Chee Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10957-10961Google Scholar, 10Clancy R.M.

The observed time-dependent recovery of GSH in the cells (10Clancy R.M. Levartovsky D. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Yegudin J. Abramson S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism of cleavage is thus unknown. nitric oxide nitroxyl anion S-nitrosoglutathione thioredoxin reductase thioredoxin dithiothreitol 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reduced thioredoxin oxidized thioredoxin nitrite superoxide high performance liquid chromatography. Thioredoxin is a 12-kDa protein with a redox active disulfide in the conserved active site sequence -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys- located on a protrusion in its three-dimensional structure (12Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Google Scholar). Reduced thioredoxin (Trx-(SH)2) operates together with thioredoxin reductase and NADPH (the thioredoxin system) as a general protein disulfide reductase (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 14Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Google Scholar). NADPH will reduce an active site disulfide in thioredoxin reductase (TR) which then reduces oxidized thioredoxin (Trx-S2) to Trx-(SH)2 which is reoxidized in a direct reaction with a disulfide (Reactions 1-3). NADPH+H++TR−S2+NADP++TR−(SH)2 REACTION 1 TR−(SH)2+Trx−S2→TR-S2+Trx−(SH)2 REACTION 2 Trx−(SH)2+protein−S2→Trx-S2+protein−(SH)2 REACTION 3 Since the disulfides of insulin efficiently oxidize Trx-(SH)2 (Reaction 3) (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar), this protein is used as a classical substrate to test the activity of the Trx system (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). The direct reaction between Trx-(SH)2 and insulin (K2 >5 × 104M−1s−1) is more than 104 times faster than the equivalent reaction with the well known dithiothreitol (DTT) molecule (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). Mammalian thioredoxin reductases (Mr 116,000) show an intriguing substrate specificity, reducing not only thioredoxins from many species but also 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoicacid) (DTNB), selenodiglutathione, vitamin K, or alloxan (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 14Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Google Scholar, 15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). In contrast, the well characterized Escherichia coli TR (Mr70,000) is highly specific for the homologous Trx and some related prokaryotic thioredoxins (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 14Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Google Scholar, 15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Trx or TR could catalyze the reduction of GSNO. Our results showed that oxidation of NADPH by GSNO in the presence of TR and Trx released GSH and nitric oxide. Incubations with GSNO also inhibited the activity of the mammalian thioredox- in system. GSNO was synthesized by reaction of GSH and acidified sodium nitrite as described elsewhere (16Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Google Scholar) and was of better than 97% purity by HPLC analysis (17Clancy R.M. Abramson S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 365-371Google Scholar). Upon synthesis GSNO was stored in the dark at −20°C. The GSNO concentration was determined using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 0.92 at 335 nm (16Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Google Scholar). TR was purified to homogeneity from human placenta and calf thymus essentially as described previously (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). Human Trx was a pure recombinant preparation (18Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Google Scholar) and was reduced prior to use by incubation with DTT followed by a desalting step on a NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 column (18Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Google Scholar). Homogeneous preparations of E. coli TR and E. coli Trx were prepared as described elsewhere (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). Horse heart oxymyoglobin (Sigma) was prepared by dithionite reduction of myoglobin in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, followed by desalting on a NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column equilibrated with the same buffer. This oxymyoglobin solution was stored at −70°C until use (5Annelle J.S. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar). Metmyoglobin was prepared by oxidizing horse heart myoglobin in 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with a 5% molar excess of potassium ferricyanide in the same buffer. This was followed by a desalting step on a NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with the same buffer (5Annelle J.S. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar). All kinetic experiments were performed in 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, containing 400 µM NADPH at 25°C. The oxidation of NADPH was followed at 340 nm in semimicro Quartz cuvettes (final volume of the reaction was 0.5 ml) using a Shimadzu UV2100 or a Zeiss PMQIII spectrophotometer and calculated with a millimolar extinction coefficient of 6.2. Since GSNO absorbs light at 340 nm, the reference cuvette usually contained GSNO at the same concentration as the sample cuvette to correct for the absorption of this compound. Fresh stock solutions of GSNO were prepared in H2O, and kept on ice between experiments. During the time and under our experimental conditions spontaneous degradation of GSNO was negligible with a measured half-life of more than 10 h. Details of enzyme activity determinations using insulin reduction experiments have been described previously (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). The method previously described was used, with argon equilibration of solutions and measurements in special cuvettes covered by rubber septa (19Björnstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8030-8034Google Scholar). The myoglobin assay was utilized to determine whether NO· or NO− species were released (5Annelle J.S. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar) in the reaction of Trx-(SH)2 with GSNO. NO· release was followed by monitoring the conversion of oxymyoglobin to metmyoglobin spectrophotometrically (20Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Google Scholar, 21Bazylinski D.A. Hollocher T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 79828-79860Google Scholar). Spectra from 520 to 640 nm were recorded at specified time intervals. Decreases in absorbance at 542 and 580 nm, accompanied by increases at 632 were considered indicative of metmyoglobin formation and NO· release. The assay was performed in 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, by mixing equimolar amounts (100 µM) of Trx-(SH)2 and GSNO in the presence of 40 µM oxymyoglobin. NO− release was monitored spectrophotometrically by following the reduction of metmyoglobin to its ferrous form under anaerobic conditions (20Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Google Scholar, 21Bazylinski D.A. Hollocher T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 79828-79860Google Scholar). Spectra from 520 to 640 nm were recorded at specified time intervals. Increases in absorbance at 542 and 580 nm, accompanied by decreases at 640 nm were considered indicative of the reduction of Fe(III) myoglobin to Fe(II) myoglobin and NO− release. Assay solutions contained 40 µM metmyoglobin to which equimolar amounts (100 µM) of Trx-(SH)2 and GSNO were added in 100 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. The extinction coefficient for oxymyoglobin at pH 7.0 is 13.9 mM−1 cm−1 at 542 nm and 14.4 mM−1 cm−1 at 580 nm (21Bazylinski D.A. Hollocher T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 79828-79860Google Scholar), while for GSNO it is 0.015 mM−1 cm−1 at 545 nm (16Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Google Scholar) and its contribution to the absorbance at these wavelengths was disregarded. The measurements were performed using a Shimadzu UV2100 spectrophotometer. Protein fluorescence of E. coli Trx was measured with a thermostated Spex FluoroMax spectrofluorimeter at 25°C. Trx-S2 was reduced by a 100-fold molar excess of DTT at 37°C for 15 min followed by careful removal of DTT on a 3 ml column of NAP-5 Sephadex G-25, which was equilibrated with N2-treated 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. Excitation of tryptophan fluorescence in Trx was done at 280 nm, and emission spectra from 300 to 400 were recorded (22Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1992-1998Google Scholar). For spectral recordings at different times the samples contained 1.0 µM Trx-(SH)2 in 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 to which 10 µM of GSNO was added. Reaction rates were obtained by following the decrease of fluorescence at the emission wavelength of 350 nm after mixing 1.0 µM GSNO and 1.0 µM Trx-(SH)2. In other reactions the rate using GSSG (1.0 µM) in place of GSNO was determined. A reaction between GSNO and E. coli TR and Trx was performed in 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, containing 400 µM NADPH in a final volume of 750 µl. To bo th the sample and the reference cuvette was added 200 µM GSNO. The reaction was started by adding to the sample cuvette E. coli TR and Trx to final concentrations of 0.1 and 5.0 µM, respectively. The oxidation of NADPH was followed at 340 nm for 45 min. Aliquots (50 µl) were taken from both the sample and the reference cuvette, every 15 min and analyzed by HPLC separation (17Clancy R.M. Abramson S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 365-371Google Scholar) as described below. The net free thiol content in the sample after a 45-min reaction was determined at 412 nm by addition of 1 volume of 1 mM DTNB in 6 M guanidine HCl (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar, 23Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Google Scholar). The reaction stoichiometry using homogeneous human placenta TR was also analyzed in 1.00 ml of 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, containing 200 µM NADPH. To both the sample and the reference cuvette was added 50 µM GSNO. The reaction was started by adding human placenta TR (0.1 µM) to the sample cuvette and oxidation of NADPH was followed at 340 nm during 20 min. Aliquots (100 µl) were taken from both the sample and the reference cuvettes at 5, 10, and 20 min, and the free thiol content was determined at 412 nm after addition of 5 volumes of 1 mM DTNB (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar, 23Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Google Scholar), and GSNO was determined by HPLC analysis. Aliquots (50 µl) to be analyzed were immediately treated by centrifugal filtration for 5 min at 4°C to remove protein (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore), and the filtrates were analyzed by HPLC separation (17Clancy R.M. Abramson S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 365-371Google Scholar). Chromatographic conditions were as follows: stationary phase, C18 column, 250 × 4.6 mm; particle size; 5.0 µm (Supelco, Sweden); and mobile phase, isocratic elution at 1 ml/min with 20% methanol, 80% NAH2PO4 containing 1 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid, pH 2.4. Detection was at 220 nm. The retention times of authentic GSNO and nitrite were 6.4 ± 0.5 and 7.6 ± 0.5 min, respectively. Standards were run of GSH, GSSG, and sodium nitrite. When NADPH and calf thymus TR (0.1 µM) were mixed with different concentrations of GSNO (10-200 µM) the absorbance at 340 nm decreased, demonstrating a time-dependent oxidation of NADPH. The reactions were enzyme-dependent and linear for extended periods of time. When the initial rates were plotted against the concentrations of GSNO (Fig. 1A), the apparent Km value for GSNO in the reaction was 60 µM and the apparent Vmax was 3.5 µM× min−1 or equivalent to a Kcat of 0.6 × s−1. The Kcat/Km calculated for the reaction was 105M−1s−1 which is about 2% of the corresponding Kcat/Km (107M−1s−1) for Trx-S2, the natural substrate for the calf thymus enzyme (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). Human placenta TR showed the same reactivity as the calf thymus enzyme. Glutathione reductase from yeast or rat liver showed no activity with GSNO (data not shown) in agreement with the result of others (17Clancy R.M. Abramson S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 365-371Google Scholar) and the preparation of TR used was devoid of such activity. Determination of the reaction stoichiometry at different time points showed that the oxidation of 1 mol of NADPH was followed by the formation of 1.0 ± 0.1 mol of free SH groups as determined by DTNB (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar, 23Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Google Scholar), indicating release of GSH. With calf thymus TR (0.1 µM), the addition of human Trx (5.0 µM) strongly increased the initial reaction rates with lower concentrations of GSNO indicating that the reduced forms of both TR and Trx were oxidized by GSNO (Fig. 1B). However, with Trx present, linear reactions were observed only for progressively shorter time periods dependent on increasing GSNO concentrations. This is shown by the fact that the plot of the rates calculated between the first and second min actually decreased at high (>50 µM GSNO) concentrations (Fig. 1B). This time-dependent inhibition of the activity made comparisons of Km values difficult, but as seen from Fig. 1B the apparent Km value for GSNO with Trx present may be in the range of 10 µM, apparently lower than that seen with only TR. As seen from Fig. 1C a concentration-dependent oxidation of NADPH was obtained with GSNO without any major signs of inhibition at higher concentrations. The apparent Km value for GSNO in this reaction was 100 µM. The direct activity of E. coli TR with NADPH and GSNO was very low (Fig. 1C), and the reaction was thus dependent on Trx. This is in agreement with the known high specificity of the E. coli enzyme (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 14Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Google Scholar, 15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). Repeated experiments showed that oxidation of 1 mol of NADPH by 1 mol of GSNO was accompanied by formation of 1.1 mol of free SH groups as determined by DTNB in 6 M guanidine-Cl (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar), indicating release of GSH. The reactivity of GSNO with the mammalian and the E. coli thioredoxin system was also examined in the absence of oxygen. Thus, anaerobic measurements using the E. coli thioredoxin system and GSNO showed decreased reaction rates as compared to aerobic conditions (Table I). Also the reactivity of the mammalian thioredoxin system with GSNO was significantly lower (Table I). With the E. coli Trx system admission of air resulted in increased reaction rates after a short lag phase. Under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the oxidation of 1 mol of NADPH resulted in the generation of 1 mol of free SH groups, as analyzed by DTNB.Table IComparison of influence of oxygen on the rate of GSNO reductionGSNOMammalian Trx systemE. coli Trx systemAnaerobicAerobicAnaerobicAerobicµMΔA340× min−1100.0120.0120.0020.003400.0090.0140.0070.0121000.0020.0100.0100.025 Open table in a new tab Characterization of products from the reactions of GSNO with the Trx systems was achieved by HPLC analysis (Fig. 2). Aliquots were taken from the reaction mixture at defined time points, and elution profiles were compared with known standards. This proved that consumption of GSNO lead to formation of the products GSH and nitrite (NO−2); the loss of GSNO was the same as calculated from the oxidation of NADPH independently determined at 340 nm. The direct reaction between GSNO and chemically reduced Trx-(SH)2 was also determined. E. coli Trx-(SH)2 contains only two sulfhydryl groups which are located in the active site and has a 3-fold higher tryptophan fluoresence emission compared with the oxidized form (22Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1992-1998Google Scholar). Mixing GSNO and Trx-(SH)2 resulted in a time-dependent fluorescence decrease demonstrating oxidation to Trx-S2 (Fig. 3A). From analysis of the rate using equimolar or excess of GSNO, the reaction was shown to follow apparent second order kinetics, with a value for K2 of 760 M−1s−1. The corresponding reaction with GSSG, one of the potential products of GSNO cleavage, was also measured (Fig. 3B). GSSG showed a slower reaction (100 M−1s−1), in agreement with previous spectrophotometric measurements showing that GSSG is a relatively inert substrate for Trx-(SH)2 (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar). The results thus demonstrated that GSNO was around 7-fold more efficient than GSSG as an oxidant of Trx-(SH)2. When oxymyoglobin (Fe(II)) was incubated with Trx-(SH)2 and GSNO a time-dependent complete conversion to metmyoglobin (Fe(III)) was observed, indicating release of NO· (Fig. 4A). In the same time frame there was no significant interaction between oxymyoglobin and either Trx-(SH)2 or GSNO in separate incubations (data not shown). There was little if any conversion of metmyoglobin to Fe(II)-nitrosylmyoglobin when incubated with Trx-(SH)2 and GSNO (Fig. 4B), thus showing that NO− was not released. Parallel fluorescence measurements showed that oxidation of Trx-(SH)2 took place under these anaerobic conditions. Separate incubations of metmyoglobin with Trx-(SH)2 or GSNO also did not result in conversion of metmyoglobin (not shown). To examine the inhibiting effect of GSNO or the reaction products on the mammalian thioredoxin system, reduction of insulin disulfides was used (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar). After reduction of insulin for 1 min, different concentrations of GSNO were added and the reaction rates were followed as oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm. With 50 nM calf thymus TR and 1.0 µM of human Trx, there was a strong inhibition of insulin disulfide reduction (Fig. 5) This, was dependent on the GSNO concentration and from the data obtained in this experiment an apparent IC50 = 10 µM was calculated (Fig. 5). Subsequent experiments with addition of more of either TR or Trx to a reaction which had stopped, showed that TR was inactivated. Thus, GSNO or the reaction products resulted in a thioredoxin-dependent inhibition of TR similar to what has been described for DTNB (18Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that GSNO is reduced by either human or calf thymus thioredoxin reductase or also by thioredoxin. That GSNO is an oxidizing substrate for Trx-(SH)2 was directly shown by spectrophotometric measurements in the presence of E. coli TR which had negligible activity by itself or by direct recording of the well known intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence change characteristic of formation of the disulfide in Trx-S2 (15Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Google Scholar, 22Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1992-1998Google Scholar). E. coli Trx-(SH)2, with known high resolution structure in solution (24Jeng M.F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Google Scholar), has only the sulfur of Cys 32 exposed in a hydrophobic active site surface, whereas the thiol group of Cys-35 is buried. The Cys-32 thiol acts as a potent nucleophile (12Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Google Scholar). The reaction of Trx-(SH)2 with GSNO is proposed to operate by Reactions (4Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar, 5Annelle J.S. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar, 6Duhe R.J. Nielsen M.D. Dittman A.H. Villacres E.C. Choi E-J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Google Scholar, 7Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z-H. Sizheng L.Z. Chen H-S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo D.J.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Google Scholar). The products of this direct reaction, Trx-S2 and NO·, have been determined experimentally. Superoxide radical (O2) has been qualitatively detected by the L-epinephrine method (25McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Google Scholar) where the formation of the product, adrenochrome, was followed as the change of absorbance at 480 nm (data not shown). The mechanism shown in Reactions 6 and 7 has been proposed for phenoxyl radical-catalyzed oxidation of E. coli Trx (26Goldman R. Stoyanovsky D.A. Day B.W. Kagan V.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4765-4772Google Scholar). Reaction 8 summarizes our experimental results and is consistent with a mechanism of homolytic cleavage catalyzed by thioredoxin (Reaction 8). Trx−(SH)2+GSNO+O2→Trx-S2+GSH+NO·+O2˙− REACTION 8 Trx-S2 generated will be reduced in the presence of TR and NADPH (Reactions 1 and 2) and thus one mol of NADPH will be consumed per mol of GSNO reduced. The fact that Reaction 8 is oxygen-dependent can explain the observed faster reaction rates of the mammalian and the E. coli thioredoxin system with GSNO in the presence of oxygen as compared to anaerobic conditions. Thioredoxin reductase from mammalian cells directly reduced GSNO. This enzyme also presumably contains a dithiol in the active site after reduction by NADPH (Reactions 1 and 2) which will be reoxidized by GSNO. In particular, it should be noted that human or calf thymus TR have no activity with GSSG as a substrate so this rules out any mechanism with GSSG as substrate in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. However, since the amount of the enzyme available is the limiting factor we have not yet been able to further pursue the elucidation of the mechanism for the enzyme in the reaction with GSNO. Although Trx-(SH)2 can reduce GSSG, a homolytic cleavage mechanism involving GSSG is unlikely and we demonstrated that GSNO itself oxidized Trx-(SH)2 7-fold faster than GSSG. As seen from Reaction 8, the product of GSNO reduction by Trx-(SH)2 is NO. The NO[rchemp is an unstable species which reacts with oxygen (27Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoloulou D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5881-5883Google Scholar) yielding nitrite (Reactions 9 and 10). NO can also react with superoxide radical (29Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Google Scholar) giving rise to peroxynitrite (Reaction 11), which can decompose to toxic hydroxyl radical or ultimately to nitrate (Reaction 12). 2NO·+O2→NOx REACTION 9 NOx+H2O→NO2− REACTION 10 NO·+O2·−→OONO− REACTION 11 OONO−+H+→OH·+NO2·−→NO3−+H+ REACTION 12 In our HPLC chromatogram we observed (NO−2 in 40-50% of the theoretical yield; nitrate was not visible and quantitated. Model reactions of the decomposition of GSNO in the presence of dihydrolipoate and dithiothreitol have been studied by Arnelle and Stamler (5Annelle J.S. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar). These vicinal dithiols catalyzed GSNO cleavage with rates of 2 and 8 M−1s−1, respectively, with formation of both GSSG and a production of nitroxylate (NO−), indicating heterolytic cleavage as a main reaction pathway (5Annelle J.S. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar). With the thioredoxin, which also carries vicinal thiols a heterolytic cleavage would yield NO− and GSH. However, we have not detected NO− production but rather a release of NO in the fast direct reaction between E. coli Trx-(SH)2 and GSNO, demonstrating a homolytic cleavage mechanism (Reaction 8). Interestingly, the mammalian TR was inhibited by the reaction with GSNO when Trx was present. As discussed above, NO or other species generated in the reaction may lead to the formation of an artificial disulfide between the enzyme and Trx. However, the detailed mechanism of the inhibition is so far unknown. Previous results showed that human TR is sensitive to inactivation when both human Trx and DTNB are present (18Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Google Scholar). In human Trx a critical structural cysteine (Cys-72) residue is located close to the active site and proposed to inactivate TR by cross-linking also when selenite is used as a substrate (19Björnstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8030-8034Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate a novel catalytic activity of the mammalian thioredoxin system with physiological concentrations of GSNO, which results in liberation of NO· and GSH and is coupled to oxidation of NADPH. In addition to being a substrate, GSNO was shown to inhibit the mammalian thioredoxin system, through a novel mechanism which may regulate activity. Both low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols, like GSNO or S-nitrosocysteine, and S-nitrosoproteins have been suggested to store NO and drastically prolong the half-life in vivo (4Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar, 30Stamler J.S. Simon S.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Google Scholar). The observed ability of the mammalian thioredoxin system to cleave the S-nitrosothiol bond in GSNO indicates that other cellular nitrosothiols, such as nitrosylated proteins, are good substrates. Trx and TR are expressed in variable amounts in different cells and also do not always coexist (31Rozell B. Hansson H.-A. Luthman M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 79-86Google Scholar). This in combination with a relation to cell membranes may be relevant for the release and metabolism of nitrogen oxides in specific tissues. Further studies of the reactivity of the thioredoxin system with S-nitrosylated proteins like p21ras, the mechanisms of the reaction and its in vivo effects are in progress."

The interaction of the two domains has been suggested to be responsible for the apoE4-binding preference for very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). In the absence of this interaction in apoE3, the preference is for high density lipoproteins (HDL). To exclude the possibility that the interaction of apoE with other apolipoproteins on the native particles may contribute to the isoform-specific preferences, VLDL-like emulsion particles were incubated with apoE, and the lipid-bound apoE was separated from free apoE on a Superose 6 column. The apoE4 bound more effectively to these particles than did apoE3, indicating that the apoE4 preference for VLDL is due not to interactions with other apolipoproteins but to an intrinsic property of apoE4, likely related to domain interaction. Previously, arginine 61 was shown to be critical for the isoform preferences, suggesting that it interacted with an acidic residue(s) in the carboxyl terminus. Substitution of arginine 61 with lysine did not alter the preference of apoE4 for VLDL, demonstrating that a positive charge rather than a specific requirement for arginine is critical for domain interaction. To identify the acidic residue(s) in the carboxyl terminus interacting with arginine 61, the six acidic residues (244, 245, 255, 266, 270, and 271) in a region known to be important for both lipoprotein association and isoform-specific preferences were substituted individually with alanine in apoE4. Only substitution of glutamic acid 255 altered the preference of apoE4 from VLDL to HDL, indicating that this was the sole residue in the carboxyl terminus that interacts with arginine 61. The participation of the hinge region in domain interaction was examined with internal deletion mutants. Deletion of the residues 186-202 or 186-223, representing major portions of the hinge region, had no effect on the apoE4 preference for VLDL. This suggests that the hinge region may act as a spacer that connects the two domains. Further deletion into the carboxyl-terminal domain (to residue 244) results in a loss of apoE4 VLDL binding.

INTRODUCTIONThe genes that regulate the transition from a proliferative to a quiescent state are beginning to be understood at the molecular level. It has been recognized, however, that several key molecules in cancer development are proteins that operate outside the nucleus and often interact at the cell-matrix boundaries either by detecting changes in the extracellular environment or by relaying messages from receptor-transducer proteins to their control machineries. Under the appropriate circumstances, the latter genes may act as tumor suppressor genes. Several lines of evidence indicate that decorin (1Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family (2Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), is intimately associated with growth suppression activity (3Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E.

For example, this proteoglycan is markedly up-regulated during quiescence in human diploid fibroblasts (5Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of decorin gene expression also occurs when HeLa cervical carcinoma cells are rendered quiescent by serum deprivation (6Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, decorin is rarely expressed by actively dividing normal cells as well as in SV40 transformed cells (2Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 5Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S.

Using a gene transfer approach in human colon WiDr/HT29 carcinoma cells, which do not constitutively express this gene (12Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we discovered that the de novo expression of decorin reverted the cells to a “normal” phenotype: the cells lost anchorage-independent growth, failed to generate tumors in scid/scid mice, and were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The cells could reenter the cell cycle when decorin expression was abrogated by decorin-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Of note, these effects were due to neither clonal selection nor integration site, indicating that decorin might be a component of a negative loop that controls cell growth.In this paper, we show that the decorin-induced growth suppression is associated with an up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) 1The abbreviations used are: p21the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase activity p21WAF1/CIP1CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseTGF-βtransforming growth factor-βPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and that this leads to a suppression of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity in a TGF-β- and p53-independent pathway. Abrogation of decorin expression by decorin-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment leads to suppression of expression of p21 and restoration of cellular growth. These results demonstrate for the first time that an extracellular matrix proteoglycan can regulate the cell cycle and that p21 is a downstream effector of this biological process.DISCUSSIONAn emerging concept in cancer biology is that the cyclin·CDK complexes are relatively well regulated in relation to the coordination of DNA replication and mitosis (23Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Morgan D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 32Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). However, transformed cells are unable to regulate these complexes vis-á-vis DNA damage or extracellular signals (23Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Morgan D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 25MacLachlan T.K. Sang N. Giordano A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Two independent lines of evidence point to decorin as a potential extracellular growth regulator. The first derives from the observation that decorin is up-regulated during quiescence in human diploid fibroblasts (5Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and in growth-arrested vascular smooth muscle cells (7Asundi V.K. Dreher K.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 314-321PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin is one of several genes, named quiescins, whose expression is up-regulated 10-40-fold vis-á-vis rapidly proliferating cells (5Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, various types of collagen, such as types I, III, and VI, are members of the quiescins. Because, all these collagenous proteins interact specifically with the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (2Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), including decorin (33Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 34Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that part of the complex regulation of cell cycle arrest, e.g. during contact inhibition of normal diploid cells, may also include coordinately regulated extracellular matrix genes. The up-regulation of decorin is long lasting, up to 16 days after reaching confluence, and is transcriptionally suppressed by tumor necrosis factor-α (6Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The second line of evidence is based on experiments employing gene transfer and forced expression of decorin in cells that do not otherwise express this proteoglycan. For example, ectopic expression of decorin in Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to growth suppression via a block of TGF-β (3Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1988; 336: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), whereas de novo expression of decorin in human colon carcinoma cells abrogates the malignant phenotype by arresting the cells in G1 (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended our original observation and discovered a link between a secreted proteoglycan and the cell cycle machinery. Specifically, we discovered that decorin-induced cell cycle arrest of colon carcinoma cells was accompanied by a marked inhibition of cyclin and CDK activities without any significant change in their protein levels. The generalized reduction in kinase activity suggested the action of a potent inhibitory molecule acting at multiple cell cycle checkpoints. Our results demonstrate that this growth arrest was due to an induction of p21 message and protein levels via a mechanism that is independent of either TGF-β or p53 and that p21 exists in a multimeric complex with cyclins and CDKs in the nuclei of growth-arrested cells. Indeed, p21 is a potent inhibitor of CDK complexes (27Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar), is induced in senescent cells (35Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), and is transcriptionally regulated by p53 (16El-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Wiman K.G. Mercer W.E. Kastan M.B. Kohn K.W. Elledge S.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that p21 acts as an inhibitory buffer whose levels dictate the threshold kinase activity required for cell cycle progression (36Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.-H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Thus, the marked increase in p21 complexed with various cyclins and CDKs could provide a likely explanation for the action of decorin in the expressing cells: the induction of p21 would prevent phosphorylation of critical CDK substrates and block cell cycle progression. In the wild-type colon carcinoma cells with inactive p53 (22Rodrigues N.R. Rowan A. Smith M.E.F. Kerr I.B. Bodmer W.F. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7555-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), this pathway would be defective, thereby permitting unregulated growth.Through the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to lower the expression of decorin, we provide evidence that the levels of decorin transcript are directly linked to those of p21 and that reduction of both genes leads to growth stimulation. Of note, a recent report (37Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that transformed fibroblasts maintain constantly activated cyclin E·CDK2 complexes regardless of attachment, whereas in normal fibroblasts these complexes are activated only upon cell attachment. The lack of cyclin E·CDK2 activity in suspended cells is the result of an increased expression of CDK2 inhibitors, including p21 (37Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These results are in support of our finding in colon carcinoma cells (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and those reported here insofar as augmentation of nuclear p21 parallels a loss of anchorage-independent growth and a decline in cyclin·CDK activity without significantly affecting their steady-state protein levels.How general is this decorin-induced tumor suppression? Our recent unpublished results have shown that ectopic expression of decorin suppresses growth not only in colon carcinoma cells but also in several mammalian tumor cell lines of diverse histogenetic origin, including fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, melanoma, and leukemic tumor cells. In all instances the attenuated growth kinetics were associated with an up-regulation of p21 mRNA and a concomitant increase in the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, decorin appears to be a general growth suppressor protein acting from the “outside” of the cell. Appearance of this gene around certain epithelial neoplasms (8Adany R. Heimer R. Caterson B. Sorrell J.M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11389-11396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could represent a protective mechanism by which the normal stroma counteracts the invasive malignant cells. INTRODUCTIONThe genes that regulate the transition from a proliferative to a quiescent state are beginning to be understood at the molecular level. It has been recognized, however, that several key molecules in cancer development are proteins that operate outside the nucleus and often interact at the cell-matrix boundaries either by detecting changes in the extracellular environment or by relaying messages from receptor-transducer proteins to their control machineries.

Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we discovered that the de novo expression of decorin reverted the cells to a “normal” phenotype: the cells lost anchorage-independent growth, failed to generate tumors in scid/scid mice, and were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The cells could reenter the cell cycle when decorin expression was abrogated by decorin-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Of note, these effects were due to neither clonal selection nor integration site, indicating that decorin might be a component of a negative loop that controls cell growth.In this paper, we show that the decorin-induced growth suppression is associated with an up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) 1The abbreviations used are: p21the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase activity p21WAF1/CIP1CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseTGF-βtransforming growth factor-βPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and that this leads to a suppression of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity in a TGF-β- and p53-independent pathway. Abrogation of decorin expression by decorin-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment leads to suppression of expression of p21 and restoration of cellular growth. These results demonstrate for the first time that an extracellular matrix proteoglycan can regulate the cell cycle and that p21 is a downstream effector of this biological process. The genes that regulate the transition from a proliferative to a quiescent state are beginning to be understood at the molecular level. It has been recognized, however, that several key molecules in cancer development are proteins that operate outside the nucleus and often interact at the cell-matrix boundaries either by detecting changes in the extracellular environment or by relaying messages from receptor-transducer proteins to their control machineries. Under the appropriate circumstances, the latter genes may act as tumor suppressor genes. Several lines of evidence indicate that decorin (1Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family (2Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), is intimately associated with growth suppression activity (3Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E.

For example, this proteoglycan is markedly up-regulated during quiescence in human diploid fibroblasts (5Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S.

Transcriptional activation of decorin gene expression also occurs when HeLa cervical carcinoma cells are rendered quiescent by serum deprivation (6Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V.

DISCUSSIONAn emerging concept in cancer biology is that the cyclin·CDK complexes are relatively well regulated in relation to the coordination of DNA replication and mitosis (23Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Morgan D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 32Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). However, transformed cells are unable to regulate these complexes vis-á-vis DNA damage or extracellular signals (23Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Morgan D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 25MacLachlan T.K. Sang N. Giordano A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Two independent lines of evidence point to decorin as a potential extracellular growth regulator. The first derives from the observation that decorin is up-regulated during quiescence in human diploid fibroblasts (5Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and in growth-arrested vascular smooth muscle cells (7Asundi V.K. Dreher K.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 314-321PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin is one of several genes, named quiescins, whose expression is up-regulated 10-40-fold vis-á-vis rapidly proliferating cells (5Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, various types of collagen, such as types I, III, and VI, are members of the quiescins. Because, all these collagenous proteins interact specifically with the small leucine-rich proteoglycans (2Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), including decorin (33Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 34Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that part of the complex regulation of cell cycle arrest, e.g. during contact inhibition of normal diploid cells, may also include coordinately regulated extracellular matrix genes. The up-regulation of decorin is long lasting, up to 16 days after reaching confluence, and is transcriptionally suppressed by tumor necrosis factor-α (6Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The second line of evidence is based on experiments employing gene transfer and forced expression of decorin in cells that do not otherwise express this proteoglycan. For example, ectopic expression of decorin in Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to growth suppression via a block of TGF-β (3Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1988; 336: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), whereas de novo expression of decorin in human colon carcinoma cells abrogates the malignant phenotype by arresting the cells in G1 (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended our original observation and discovered a link between a secreted proteoglycan and the cell cycle machinery. Specifically, we discovered that decorin-induced cell cycle arrest of colon carcinoma cells was accompanied by a marked inhibition of cyclin and CDK activities without any significant change in their protein levels. The generalized reduction in kinase activity suggested the action of a potent inhibitory molecule acting at multiple cell cycle checkpoints. Our results demonstrate that this growth arrest was due to an induction of p21 message and protein levels via a mechanism that is independent of either TGF-β or p53 and that p21 exists in a multimeric complex with cyclins and CDKs in the nuclei of growth-arrested cells. Indeed, p21 is a potent inhibitor of CDK complexes (27Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar), is induced in senescent cells (35Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), and is transcriptionally regulated by p53 (16El-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Wiman K.G. Mercer W.E. Kastan M.B. Kohn K.W. Elledge S.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that p21 acts as an inhibitory buffer whose levels dictate the threshold kinase activity required for cell cycle progression (36Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.-H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Thus, the marked increase in p21 complexed with various cyclins and CDKs could provide a likely explanation for the action of decorin in the expressing cells: the induction of p21 would prevent phosphorylation of critical CDK substrates and block cell cycle progression. In the wild-type colon carcinoma cells with inactive p53 (22Rodrigues N.R. Rowan A. Smith M.E.F. Kerr I.B. Bodmer W.F. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7555-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), this pathway would be defective, thereby permitting unregulated growth.Through the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to lower the expression of decorin, we provide evidence that the levels of decorin transcript are directly linked to those of p21 and that reduction of both genes leads to growth stimulation. Of note, a recent report (37Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that transformed fibroblasts maintain constantly activated cyclin E·CDK2 complexes regardless of attachment, whereas in normal fibroblasts these complexes are activated only upon cell attachment. The lack of cyclin E·CDK2 activity in suspended cells is the result of an increased expression of CDK2 inhibitors, including p21 (37Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These results are in support of our finding in colon carcinoma cells (13Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and those reported here insofar as augmentation of nuclear p21 parallels a loss of anchorage-independent growth and a decline in cyclin·CDK activity without significantly affecting their steady-state protein levels.How general is this decorin-induced tumor suppression? Our recent unpublished results have shown that ectopic expression of decorin suppresses growth not only in colon carcinoma cells but also in several mammalian tumor cell lines of diverse histogenetic origin, including fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, melanoma, and leukemic tumor cells. In all instances the attenuated growth kinetics were associated with an up-regulation of p21 mRNA and a concomitant increase in the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, decorin appears to be a general growth suppressor protein acting from the “outside” of the cell. Appearance of this gene around certain epithelial neoplasms (8Adany R. Heimer R. Caterson B. Sorrell J.M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11389-11396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could represent a protective mechanism by which the normal stroma counteracts the invasive malignant cells.

https://openalex.org/W2020466484,"SPRK (also called PTK-1 and MLK-3), a member of the mixed lineage kinase subfamily of (Ser/Thr) protein kinases, encodes an amino-terminal SH3 domain followed by a kinase catalytic domain, two leucine zippers interrupted by a short spacer, a Rac/Cdc42 binding domain, and a long carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region. We report herein that SPRK activates the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) but not ERK-1 during transient expression in COS cells; the p38 kinase is activated modestly (1.3-2 fold) but consistently. SPRK also activates cotransfected SEK-1/MKK-4, a dual specificity kinase which phosphorylates and activates SAPK. Reciprocally, expression of mutant, inactive SEK-1 inhibits completely the basal and SPRK-activated SAPK activity. Immunoprecipitated recombinant SPRK is able to phosphorylate and activate recombinant SEK-1 in vitro to an extent comparable to that achieved by MEK kinase-1. These results identify SPRK as a candidate upstream activator of the stress-activated protein kinases, acting through the phosphorylation and activation of SEK-1. SPRK (also called PTK-1 and MLK-3), a member of the mixed lineage kinase subfamily of (Ser/Thr) protein kinases, encodes an amino-terminal SH3 domain followed by a kinase catalytic domain, two leucine zippers interrupted by a short spacer, a Rac/Cdc42 binding domain, and a long carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region. We report herein that SPRK activates the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) but not ERK-1 during transient expression in COS cells; the p38 kinase is activated modestly (1.3-2 fold) but consistently. SPRK also activates cotransfected SEK-1/MKK-4, a dual specificity kinase which phosphorylates and activates SAPK. Reciprocally, expression of mutant, inactive SEK-1 inhibits completely the basal and SPRK-activated SAPK activity. Immunoprecipitated recombinant SPRK is able to phosphorylate and activate recombinant SEK-1 in vitro to an extent comparable to that achieved by MEK kinase-1.

RPA is a protein complex of three subunits (70, 34, and 11 kDa) that has been shown to be involved in DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, and homologous recombination. Here, we demonstrate a physical interaction between human RAD52 and RPA in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the domain (amino acids 221-280) in RAD52 protein that mediates the interaction with the 34-kDa subunit of RPA was also determined. Overexpression of mutant RAD52 proteins lacking the interaction domain (amino acids 221-240, 241-260, and 261-280) failed to induce homologous recombination in monkey cells. We have previously shown that overexpression of human RAD52 induced homologous recombination in these cells. These results suggest that direct physical interactions between RAD52 and RPA are essential for homologous recombination in mammalian cells.

These results suggest that direct physical interactions between RAD52 and RPA are essential for homologous recombination in mammalian cells. Genetic information is maintained by DNA repair and propagated to offsprings through recombination. The fidelity of these processes are crucial for the maintenance of genetic integrity of living organisms. The proteins of the RAD52 epistasis group are involved in both DNA repair, and meiotic and mitotic recombination (1Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J. Pringle J. Jones E.

Both genetic and molecular studies on the yeast RAD52 epistasis group clearly indicate close links between homologous recombination and double-strand DNA break repair (3Friedberg E.C. Siede W. Cooper A.J. Broach J. Pringle J. Jones E. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genomic Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 147Google Scholar). Most of the information regarding the functions of the RAD52 protein has come from genetic studies in yeast. These studies suggested that the RAD52 protein is not required for the initiation of recombination, but is essential for the intermediate stage following the formation of double strand breaks but before the appearance of stable recombinants (4Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Most recently, human RAD52 protein has been shown to confer resistance to ionizing radiation and induce homologous recombination in monkey cells (5Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This indicates that the RAD52-mediated homologous recombination also plays a role in double strand break repair in mammalian cells. RPA was originally identified as a HeLa cell protein required for the replication of simian virus 40 (SV 40) origin-containing DNA (ori+ DNA) in vitro (6Fairman M.P. Stillman B.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). RPA functions in the initiation and elongation stages of SV40 DNA replication. In the initiation stage, it is involved in the SV40 large tumor antigen (T antigen)-dependent unwinding of ori+ DNA (10Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P.A. Hurwitz J.

The unwinding reaction is supported by other single strand binding proteins, such as those isolated from Escherichia coli, adenovirus, or yeast (13Brill S.J. Stillman B.

We have recently shown that RPA-XPA interactions can lead to inhibition of replication, which may suggest that DNA repair overrides DNA replication in vitro through a direct interaction between RPA and XPA (20Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. Drissi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21800-21805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RPA has been shown to be also involved in homologous recombination (21Heyer W.-D. Rao M.R.S. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D.

We have recently cloned human RAD52 and established that RAD52 is involved in a homologous recombination pathway in mammalian cells (5Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We also have shown a specific interaction between human RAD52 and RAD51 in vivo and in vitro (25Shen Z. Cloud K.G. Chen D. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 148-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (176) Google Scholar). During the search for other proteins that might regulate the catalytic activity of RAD51 through a direct interaction with RAD52, we learned that RPA interacts with RAD52 protein. In this study, we demonstrated the physical interaction between human RAD52 and RPA and addressed the importance of this intermolecular interaction in homologous recombination in monkey cells. The coding region of human RAD52 (5Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was cloned into pGEXT vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseaaamino acid(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. -RAD52 protein.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) harboring pGEXT-RAD52 was grown to A600 = 0.6 in L broth supplemented with ampicillin (50 µg/ml); isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the culture was incubated for an additional 3 h at 37°C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA) containing lysozyme (300 µg/ml), and incubated for 10 min. The soluble fraction containing the GST-RAD52 was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman JA-20 rotor. Protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml each of pepstatin, chymostatin, and leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonate) were added to the lysate. GST-RAD52 was purified by GST-affinity column chromatography. glutathione S-transferase amino acid(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction. The 34-kDa subunit of RPA was cloned into a pET vector under the control of T7 promoter (26Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) and expressed as described for GST-RAD52 fusion protein. The cDNAs coding 34-kDa subunits were cloned into pET-5a (BamHI). Total cell extracts were prepared in the same manner as described above for GST-hRAD52. Expression and metabolic labeling of individual subunits of RPA and RPA complex in insect cells have been described previously (27Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To further map the RAD52/RPA-p34 interacting domain, six mutants containing a part of RAD52 protein (aa 1-165, 1-280, 166-280, 280-418, 166-220, and 221-280) were made by ligating the PCR products to the pGEXT that was restriction-digested with BamHI and XhoI. Mutant constructs were first transformed into an E. coli strain, XL2-blue (Stratagene) and subsequently screened for clones with a proper RAD52 reading frame. Then BL21(DE3) was transformed with deletion construct plasmids isolated from XL2-blue, induced, harvested, and subjected to protein purification. These mutant constructs produced truncated RAD52 proteins with the GST protein at the N terminus of the protein. Mutant proteins were purified by GST-affinity chromatography. To test interaction between RAD52 and RPA complex in vivo, total cell extracts were prepared from insect cells that were simultaneously infected with 4 independent recombinant viruses of RAD52, RPA70, RPA34, and RPA11 subunits (25Shen Z. Cloud K.G. Chen D. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 148-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Total cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-RAD52 antiserum (25Shen Z. Cloud K.G. Chen D. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 148-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and then the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody specific to 70-, 34-, and 11-kDa subunits of RPA (27Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In order to coprecipitate RAD52 and individual subunits or RPA complex expressed in insect cells, Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus constructs of 70-, 34-, and 11-kDa subunits individually or together. The proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and the total extracts were prepared as described previously (27Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The metabolically labeled total cell extracts were mixed with the E. coli lysate containing the GST-hRAD52 protein in the presence of GST-agarose beads. The proteins were prepared as described above and analyzed by PAGE and fluorography. Purified wild type or mutant RAD52 protein were mixed with the total E. coli extracts of 34-kDa subunits of RPA for 1 h at 4°C with gentle rocking. Then GST-agarose beads were added to the tube and further incubated for 2 h to overnight at 4°C with a rocking. The reaction was washed five times with the wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). Fifty µl of 2 × SDS sample buffer was added to the tube, and the sample was heated at 100°C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In order to test the role of RAD52/RPA-p34 interacting domain in homologous recombination in mammalian cells, three mammalian constructs that had deletions in the interaction domain (aa 220-280) were derived from the pBKCMV-hRAD52 construct that expresses RAD52 with the c-Myc epitope attached (5Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These construct had deletions in aa 220-240, 241-260, and 261-280, respectively. The internal deletions were introduced using ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA). The mutagenic primers were: P1(221-240), 5′-CTG CAG CTG TGG GTG TCC CAG GGC-3′; P2(221-240), 5′-TCC CGA AGC CTG AGC TCA TCC GCC-3′; P3(241-260), 5′-GCT GCA GTC CTG GTC CGC CGG TAT-3′; P4(241-260), 5′-CAG AAG CAG CTG CAG CAG CAG TTC-3′; P5(261-280), 5′-CCG GAG CTT CCG CTG GTG CGT GGC-3′; P6(261-280), 5′-ACG CCG TCA GCT GAG AAG AGT GAG-3′. FSH2 cells were transfected with the individual mutant constructs (pBKCMV-RAD52(d221-240), RAD52-(d241-260), and RAD52-(d261-280)) and selected for resistance to G418. FSH2 cells were seeded at a density of 106 cells/100-mm dish and grown for 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 10 µg of pBKCMV-RAD52 mutants by using the calcium phosphate method. After 2 weeks in selection medium containing G418 (600 µg/ml), individual colonies were picked and expanded for future use. Expanded individual clones were subjected to PCR to test the integrity of RAD52 construct. Those PCR-positive clones were further analyzed with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis to confirm the expression and integrity of mutant RAD52 protein using anti-c-Myc antibody. Homologous recombination rate in FSH2 cells was determined as described previously (5Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Ludwig D.L. Stringer J.R. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RPA is a stable complex of three polypeptides of 70, 34, and 11 kDa. To examine whether RAD52 could associate with the RPA complex in vivo, whole cell extracts were prepared from the insects cells that had been transfected simultaneously with four recombinant viruses (RAD52, RPA70, RPA34, and RPA11), and immunoprecipitated with an anti-RAD52 antiserum. The immunoprecipitants were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p11, -p34, and -p70 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, all three subunits were present in the immunoprecipitate that was produced with anti-RAD52 antiserum (lane 2), but not by preimmune serum (lane 1). To further confirm the association of RAD52 with RPA complex, in vitro binding assays were performed. We produced a GST-RAD52 fusion protein. The GST or GST-RAD52 was immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads. Insect cells were singly or multiply infected with the baculovirus recombinant constructs of p11, p34, and p70 subunits. The total cell extracts were prepared from insect cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and incubated with either GST or GST-hRAD52 beads. After washing the beads, the GST or GST-hRAD52 bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, RPA complex bound to GST-hRAD52 but not to GST. In order to determine which subunits of RPA interact with RAD52, extracts were prepared from insect cells that had been independently infected with the recombinant baculoviruses containing each subunit of RPA and mixed with either GST or GST-hRAD52 beads. As shown in Fig. 2, the p70 and p34 subunits interacted with GST-hRAD52, but the p11 subunit did not exhibit binding. The p34 subunit appeared to have higher affinity to GST-RAD52 than the p70 subunit of RPA. Because both p70 subunit of RPA and RAD52 are DNA-binding proteins, it is possible that their interaction could be mediated by DNA in the lysates, rather than direct protein-protein interaction. We can eliminate this possibility since: 1) mutant RPA p70 proteins (p70d293-373 and p70d374-458) lacking DNA binding activity can also interact with RAD52 (29Kim D.-K. Stigger E. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15124-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and 2) pretreatment of p70 lysate with DNase I had no effect on RPA p70-RAD52 interaction (data not shown). In order to map the RAD52 region that mediates the intermolecular interactions with p34 subunit of RPA, we made several deletion mutant proteins of GST-RAD52. These GST-RAD52 mutant proteins were then expressed in E. coli, purified, and mixed with the bacterial lysate containing the p34 subunit of RPA. Then, the RAD52·p34 complexes were precipitated with GST-agarose beads as described earlier. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting experiments with anti-RPA34 antibody to confirm the interaction between p34 and RAD52 mutants. As shown in Fig. 3, the region between the amino acids 221 and 280 of RAD52 is sufficient for the intermolecular association between RAD52 and p34 subunit of RPA. Since the region (aa 221-280) appeared to be required for the intermolecular interaction between RAD52 and 34-kDa subunit of RPA in vitro, functional significance of this region was tested in vivo. We have shown previously the enhanced homologous recombination by overexpression of human RAD52 in monkey cells (5Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In order to test the importance of the RAD52/RPA-p34 interacting domain in vivo, we built three mutant constructs that had deletions in the interacting domain (aa 221-280) of RAD52 and tested their ability to induce homologous recombination in monkey cells. All three deletion constructs (d221-240, d241-260, and d261-280) were able to express intact mutant proteins in FSH2 cells, demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and Western analysis on total cell extracts using anti-c-Myc antibody (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, the FSH2 cells overexpressing the mutant proteins failed to induce homologous recombination. The lack of activation of homologous recombination in monkey cells carrying the mutations in the p34-RAD52 interaction domain could be due to the lack of a direct physical interaction between these two proteins. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the lack of physical interaction could be due to more general defects in mutant RAD52 protein, for example improper folding of the mutant proteins. Multiprotein complexes are found to be involved in varieties of DNA metabolism, including various types of DNA repair (30Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1953-1958Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 31Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D.

Recently, a mammalian protein complex that repairs double strand breaks by recombination has been identified (33Jessberger R. Podust V. Hubscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of higher order complexes through direct physical association appears to be crucial for proper biochemical activities of these complexes. Here, we report a direct physical association of human recombination protein RAD52 and RPA both in vivo and in vitro. We further identified a RAD52 region that mediates this intermolecular interaction. We also determined functional significance of this domain in vivo using a homologous recombination assay in monkey cells. So far there has been only limited information on biochemical activities that are associated with the human RAD52 protein. However, yeast genetic studies provide a great deal of insights about the potential role of RAD52 in mammalian cells. Most recently, we demonstrated that RAD52 protein protects mammalian cells from ionizing radiation (5Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This resistance of monkey cells to γ-rays appears to be achieved by intrachromosomal recombination that is mediated by RAD52 protein. Throughout the years, it has been postulated that RAD52 might modulate the catalytic activities of RAD51 protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange, but there is no direct biochemical evidence to support this hypothesis. Most recently, we have shown a physical interaction between human RAD51 and RAD52. In this study, we demonstrated a direct physical association between RAD52 and RPA complex both in vivo and in vitro. We speculate that the catalytic activity of RAD51 can be further fine-tuned through the formation of the ternary complex among RAD51, RAD52, and RPA. It is also tempting to speculate that RAD52 may bring different molecules together that are involved in recombination. This notion is supported by the unusual nature of structural organization of RAD52 protein. The RAD52 protein contains several distinct functional domains as shown in Fig. 5A. Remarkably, most parts of this 418-amino acid protein are used for diverse functions, including DNA binding, 2M. S. Park, unpublished results. self-association, 3Z. Shen, personal communication. interaction with RPA (present study), and interaction with RAD51 (25Shen Z. Cloud K.G. Chen D. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 148-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This clearly suggests the versatility of this protein in terms of intra/intermolecular interactions and its potential role as a nucleating factor that brings many different molecules together to the site of action. Another corroborating evidence comes from our previous observation of the dominant positive effects of RAD52 in mammalian recombination in vivo. The positive effect could have been due to the efficient nucleation of many other players such as RPA and RAD51 to the site of action through intermolecular interactions. These other players could be human homologs of yeast Rad55 and Rad57 that were proposed to constitute part of a complex, a “recombinosome” (34Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Berg P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 6925-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 35Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The region of RAD52 that mediates the interaction with the 34-kDa subunit of RPA appears to be located between aa 221 and 280. This region is highly divergent among species and has only a limited amount of homology (~7% identity, Fig. 5B) between yeast and human (5Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15467-15470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This suggests that a species-specific interaction between human RPA and RAD52 is required for a productive biochemical transaction such as mammalian recombination. It has been shown previously that heterologous single strand binding proteins could not substitute for mammalian RPA in diverse aspects of DNA metabolism (13Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Coverly D. Kenny M.K. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Lane D.P. Wood R.D.

A. 1991; 88: 9067-9071Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The interaction between RAD51 and RAD52 also appears to be species-specific, because the overexpression of mammalian RAD51 genes failed to functionally complement yeast Rad51 null mutations (36Ogawa T. Shinohara A. Nabetani A. Ikeya T. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Ogawa H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The interacting domain also has a very limited homology between yeast and human (Fig. 5B). Taken together, species-specific intermolecular interactions among human RPA, RAD52, and RAD51 appear to add another level of complexity to the intermolecular interactions among proteins that are involved in mammalian homologous recombination. The primary structure of the RAD52 region that interacts with the 34-kDa subunit of RPA reveals an interesting feature of stretches of basic residues, suggesting a potential for interaction with the acidic C terminus of the 34-kDa subunit of RPA. This acidic domain on the 34-kDa subunit of RPA has been shown to interact with other proteins such as SV40 T-antigen (37Lee S.H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and XPA (37Lee S.H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is proven to be valid by our observation of the absence of physical interaction between RAD52 and a 34-kDa deletion mutant lacking the last 33 amino acids at the C terminus. 4S.-H. Lee, unpublished results. All these data taken together suggest that this particular domain of the 34-kDa subunit is specifically required for diverse DNA transactions. This invokes a novel role of the 34-kDa subunit of RPA as a universal modulator of DNA replication, repair, and recombination. These transactions may be dependent on species-specific intermolecular interactions in vivo. We thank Dr. Zhiyuan Shen for providing a RAD52 deletion construct for our early domain mapping studies and communicating unpublished results of self-association domain of RAD52. We also thank Dr. Ronald Gary for careful reading of the manuscript."

Here we show that two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, blocked an essential step in the differentiation of two skeletal muscle cell models. Both inhibitors abolished the capacity of L6E9 myoblasts to form myotubes, without affecting myoblast proliferation, elongation, or alignment. Myogenic events like the induction of myogenin and of glucose carrier GLUT4 were also blocked and myoblasts could not exit the cell cycle, as measured by the lack of mRNA induction of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Overexpresssion of MyoD in 10T1/2 cells was not sufficient to bypass the myogenic differentiation blockade by LY294002. Upon serum withdrawal, 10T1/2-MyoD cells formed myotubes and showed increased levels of myogenin and p21. In contrast, LY294002-treated cells exhibited none of these myogenic characteristics and maintained high levels of Id, a negative regulator of myogenesis. These data indicate that whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is not indispensable for cell proliferation or in the initial events of myoblast differentiation, i.e. elongation and alignment, it appears to be essential for terminal differentiation of muscle cells.

These data indicate that whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is not indispensable for cell proliferation or in the initial events of myoblast differentiation, i.e. elongation and alignment, it appears to be essential for terminal differentiation of muscle cells. The development of skeletal muscle is a multistep process that involves the determination of pluripotential mesodermal cells to give rise to myoblasts, withdrawal of the myoblasts from the cell cycle and differentiation into muscle cells, and finally growth and maturation of skeletal muscle fibers (1Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 261-272Google Scholar). At the molecular level, myogenic commitment and muscle-specific gene expression involve the skeletal muscle-specific helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixIGFinsulin-like growth factorPI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinebpbase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. MyoD family of proteins, which includes MyoD, myogenin, myf-5, and MRF4, and the myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2 (MEF2). Each of the MyoD-family proteins and also MEF2A indiscriminately direct non-muscle cells into the myogenic lineage by auto- and cross-activating bHLH genes (2Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Google Scholar, 3Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Google Scholar, 4Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Google Scholar). The myogenic activity of the MyoD family proteins requires heterodimerization with ubiquitously expressed E2a gene products to form functional transcription complexes (5Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Google Scholar, 6Chakraborty T. Brennan T.J. Li L. Edmondson D. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3633-3641Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of MyoD family proteins is attenuated by Id, which forms complexes with E2a gene products in proliferating cells and is down-regulated when they are induced to differentiate (7Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar, 8Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

The decision to differentiate into myotubes is influenced negatively by several factors. Treatment of myoblasts with fetal bovine serum, basic fibroblast growth factor 2, or transforming growth factor β1 is known to inhibit differentiation of myoblasts (9Brennan T.J. Edmondson D.G. Li L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3822-3826Google Scholar, 10Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Google Scholar). Myogenesis is also regulated negatively by oncogenes such as c-myc, c-jun, c-fos, H-ras, and E1a (11Lassar A.B. Thayer M.J. Overell R.W. Weintraub H.

There is very little information regarding the signaling that is triggered in the myoblast upon serum withdrawal which leads to the induction of the MyoD family gene expression and to muscle differentiation. Myogenic differentiation seems to depend on the activation of integrins present on the plasma membrane of myoblasts (17Menko A.S. Boettiger D. Cell. 1987; 51: 51-57Google Scholar, 18Rosen G.D. Sanes J.R. LaChance R. Cunningham J.M. Roman J. Dean D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 1107-1119Google Scholar), suggesting the operation of an “outside-in” biochemical pathway in which integrin is the upstream molecular species. Interactions of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and -II with their receptors are also positive regulators of skeletal muscle differentiation (19Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Magri K.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 201-216Google Scholar). However, the intracellular events occurring between receptor activation and terminal differentiation remain obscure. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) are involved in receptor signal transduction via tyrosine kinase receptors and in protein trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Multiple forms of PI 3-kinases have been reported. A well characterized group of PI 3-kinases are heterodimers composed of a regulatory p85 subunit and a catalytic p110 subunit (20Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Fry M.J. Ruiz-Larrea F. Panayotou G. Thompson A. Dhand R. Hsuan J. Totty N. Smith A.D. Morgan S.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J.

Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 419-429Google Scholar). In contrast, the recently cloned PI 3-kinase γ (22Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Justin Hsuan J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Google Scholar) does not couple to p85 and is activated by Gβγ subunits (23Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Google Scholar, 24Thomason P.A. James S.R. Casey P.J. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Google Scholar). A third group of PI 3-kinases includes the VPS34 gene product from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Google Scholar, 26Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Google Scholar) and its human homolog (27Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Google Scholar). The Vps34p only phosphorylates the 3′ position of PI and is required for vacuolar protein sorting (25Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Google Scholar). This last group of PI 3-kinases associate with a 150-160-kDa protein, which in S. cerevisiae is a serine/threonine kinase essential for Vps34p activity (28Stack J.H. Dewald D.B. Takegawa K. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 321-334Google Scholar). All PI 3-kinase isoforms so far described are potently inhibited in the nanomolar or low micromolar range by two structurally unrelated membrane permeant reagents: wortmannin (for review, see Ref. 29Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Google Scholar) and LY294002 (30Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar). While much information has been accumulated on the role of PI 3-kinase activities in tyrosine kinase receptor signal transduction or vesicle trafficking, little is known about the possible role of PI 3-kinases in cell differentiation. In this regard, it has been observed that PI 3-kinase might be involved in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells (31Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Google Scholar). In a previous report, we showed that PI 3-kinase activity and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6E9 muscle cells were inhibited in a dose-response manner by a 1-h treatment with wortmannin (32Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 471-477Google Scholar). Here we show that chronic treatment with LY294002 or wortmannin blocked morphological and biochemical changes associated with L6E9 myoblast terminal differentiation and that this inhibition is not bypassed by the overexpression of MyoD in 10T1/2 cells. Data presented here implicate PI 3-kinase as an essential positive regulator of terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. Wortmannin was kindly given by Dr. Trevor Payne (Sandoz, Basel) and LY294002 was from BioMol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). L6E9 rat skeletal muscle cell line was kindly provided by Dr. B. Nadal-Ginard (Harvard University). 10T1/2 cells transfected with MyoD were obtained from Dr. Vicente Andrés (St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, Boston, MA). The polyclonal antibody OSCRX was raised against the C terminus of GLUT4 (33Castelló A. Rodríguez-Manzaneque J.C. Camps M. Pérez-Castillo A. Testar X. Palacín M. Santos A. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5905-5912Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies against rat p85 PI 3-kinase were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against β1-integrin was kindly given by Dr. Carles Enrich (University of Barcelona) (34Pujades C. Forsberg E. Enrich C. Johansson S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 815-820Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding for myogenin and p21 were kindly given by Dr. Eric Olson (University of Texas, Houston, TX) and David Beach (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY), respectively. cDNA for Id was obtained from Dr. Harold Weintraub (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Rat skeletal muscle L6E9 myoblasts were grown in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin). Confluent myoblasts were differentiated by lowering FBS to a final concentration of 2% (v/v). 10T1/2 fibroblasts transfected with MyoD were grown as L6E9 cells in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml geneticin, and differentiated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% (v/v) horse serum with antibiotics and geneticin. To analyze the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on cell differentiation, confluent cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and low serum medium was added without or with LY294002 (10, 20, or 50 µM) or wortmannin (1 µM). Both inhibitors were initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and in all experimental series, control cells were treated with the corresponding volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide. Due to the instability of wortmannin in aqueous solutions (31Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Google Scholar), after washing twice in PBS, medium from cells treated with wortmannin and untreated controls was replaced every 5 h during the differentiation period (2-4 days). Total RNA from cells was extracted using the phenol/chloroform method (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 136-159Google Scholar). All samples had a 260/280 absorbance ratio above 1.7. After quantification, total RNA (30 µg) was denatured at 65°C in the presence of formamide, formaldehyde, and ethidium bromide (36Rosen K.M. Villa-Komaroff L. Focus (Idaho). 1990; 12: 23-24Google Scholar). RNA was separated on a 1.8% agarose/formaldehyde gel, blotted on Hybond N filters, and processed as previously reported (33Castelló A. Rodríguez-Manzaneque J.C. Camps M. Pérez-Castillo A. Testar X. Palacín M. Santos A. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5905-5912Google Scholar). The blots were then hybridized to the corresponding probes overnight at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, 5 × SSPE, 10% dextran sulfate, and 200 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The mouse cDNA probe for myogenin was a 1,100-base pair EcoRI fragment, the mouse cDNA probe for Id was a 900-bp SmaI fragment, and the human cDNA probe for p21 was a 600-bp NotI fragment. The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming. The probes were included at 1-2 × 106 cpm/ml. Cells were homogenized by 20 strokes with a Dounce A homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, 250 mM sucrose, 2 mM EGTA, 5 mM NaN3, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µM leupeptin, and 1 µM pepstatin, pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 760 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C to obtain the membrane fractions. The membrane pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer and repeatedly passed through a 25-gauge needle before storage at −20°C. Proteins were measured by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard and 30 µg of total membranes from each experimental series were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Immunoprecipitation from solubilized cells was performed as described previously (32Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 471-477Google Scholar). The immunopellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer under reduction conditions and electrophoresed. SDS-PAGE was performed following Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon in buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 200 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris, pH 8.3. Following transfer, the filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.02% NaN3 in PBS for 1 h at 37°C and then incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies against GLUT4 (1:400), β1-integrin (1:1000), and p85 (1:1000) in PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.02% sodium azide. β1-Integrin was detected using 125I-protein A for 3 h at room temperature. GLUT4 and p85 were detected by ECL chemiluminiscence system. L6E9 skeletal muscle myoblasts were grown in a proliferating medium containing 10% FBS (Fig. 1A) and when confluent, myoblasts were incubated in a 2% FBS-containing medium (differentiation medium). Under these conditions, myoblasts elongated and aligned with each other during the first 24 h and multinucleate myotube formation was observed during the following 72 h (Fig. 1, B and D, day 2 and 4, respectively). When the differentiation medium was added together with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10, 20, or 50 µM), L6E9 myoblasts aligned as did the untreated control myoblasts. However, no fusion into myotubes was observed during the 4 days required for full differentiation. Fig. 1 shows myoblasts treated with 10 µM LY294002 in differentiation medium for 2 and 4 days (C and E, respectively). Identical effects were observed at 20 or 50 µM LY294002 (data not shown). Myoblasts fusion was also blocked when confluent myoblasts were allowed to differentiate in a medium containing 1 µM wortmannin, another inhibitor of PI 3-kinases. It has been shown that wortmannin is highly unstable in aqueous solutions (29Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Google Scholar). For this, our dose-response studies were limited to LY294002; in experiments using 1 µM wortmannin, after washing twice in PBS, culture medium from control and treated cells was replaced by fresh medium with dimethyl sulfoxide or with wortmannin, respectively, every 5 h throughout the differentiation period (2-4 days). Under these conditions, control myoblasts aligned with each other during the first 24 h in differentiation medium (not shown) and formed multinucleate myotubes after 2 days (Fig. 2B). In contrast, myoblasts in differentiation medium with 1 µM wortmannin aligned with each other but did not fuse into myotubes (Fig. 2C). Identical effects were observed after a 4-day treatment with wortmannin (data not shown). It has been described that the lack of the bHLH muscle regulatory factor myogenin reduces myotube formation in vivo (39Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Google Scholar, 40Nabeshima Y. Hanaoka K. Hayasaka M. Esumi E. Li S. Nonaka I. Nabeshima Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Google Scholar), indicating that myogenin has a unique function in the transition from a determined myoblast to a fully differentiated myotube. Based on this, we next analyzed the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on myogenin mRNA levels during the differentiation period. As shown in Fig. 3A, LY294002 blocked the induction of myogenin mRNA which is normally observed on differentiation days 2 and 4. The maximal effect of LY294002 was observed at a concentration of 10 µM. Similar results were obtained when 1 µM wortmannin was added to the differentiation medium and myogenin mRNA levels were determined at days 2 and 4 (Fig. 3B). An early event during the muscle differentiation process is the exit of myoblasts from the cell cycle. A marker of this event is the induction of the mRNA expression of p21cdk inhibitor. Indeed, it is known that ectopic expression of p21 in growing myoblasts is sufficient to inhibit cell cycle progression (41Guo K. Wang J. Andrés V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Google Scholar). As expected, 2 days after serum deprivation, L6E9 myotubes showed increased mRNA levels of p21 compared to proliferating cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, the absence of p21 mRNA induction in LY294002-treated cells (10 µM or 20 µM), strongly suggests that PI 3-kinase activity may be essential to signal the cell cycle exit in differentiating muscle cells. To determine whether the blockade of multinucleate myotube formation by LY294002 and wortmannin was associated with the inhibition of differentiation at the biochemical level, we analyzed the expression of GLUT4, a skeletal muscle marker, in cells allowed to differentiate in the absence or presence of LY294002 or wortmannin. After 4 days in differentiation medium, the total membrane content of GLUT4 was increased by 2.42 ± 0.46-fold (n = 3) in myotubes compared to myoblasts (Fig. 5, Mt versus Mb). When 50 µM LY294002 or 1 µM wortmannin were present during the 4 days of differentiation, little or no induction in GLUT4 expression was observed (Fig. 5, LY or W versus Mb). In contrast, PI 3-kinase inhibitors did not affect the expression of two non-muscle-specific proteins: the structural plasma membrane component β1-integrin and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. As shown in Fig. 5, the expression level of these proteins was unaffected after 4 days in differentiation medium either in the absence or presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Multinucleate myotube formation together with muscle-specific gene onset can be induced by overexpression of MyoD or the other members of myogenic bHLH transcription factors (myogenin, MyoD, myf5, and MRF4); each of these four myogenic factors indiscriminately directs non-muscle cells into the myogenic lineage by auto- and cross-activating bHLH genes (2Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Google Scholar, 3Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, 10T1/2 cells stably transfected with MyoD (10T1/2-MyoD) were able to fuse to each other upon serum withdrawal. Large multinucleate myotubes were observed from differentiation day 2 up to day 4 (Fig. 6, A and C). In contrast, when confluent 10T1/2-MyoD cells were serum-deprived in the presence of 50 µM LY294002, cells progressively adopted an elongated shape but were unable to form myotubes (Fig. 6, B and D), indicating that the overexpression of MyoD could not bypass the blockade of skeletal muscle differentiation by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. We next analyzed whether LY294002 inhibition of 10T1/2-MyoD myotube formation was accompanied by a blockade of biochemical differentiation, as we had previously observed in L6E9 cells. To this end, we first determined the mRNA levels of myogenin in undifferentiated cells and in cells allowed to differentiate in the absence or presence of 50 µM LY294002 for 2 days. As seen in Fig. 7A, myogenin mRNA levels were induced after serum withdrawal in 10T1/2-MyoD cells and this induction was blocked in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. As observed for L6E9 cells and consistent with the observation that MyoD induces p21cdk inhibitor expression in vitro (41Guo K. Wang J. Andrés V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Google Scholar, 42Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Google Scholar), serum-deprived 10T1/2-MyoD cells showed increased mRNA levels of p21 compared to proliferating cells (Fig. 7B). However, as observed in L6E9 cells, p21 mRNA induction was blocked by LY294002, indicating that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor impaired the cell cycle exit. We next determined the effect of LY294002 on the mRNA levels of Id. It is known that undifferentiated 10T1/2-MyoD cells express high levels of this dominant negative bHLH protein, which inactivates MyoD by heterodimerization with E2a gene products and which is down-regulated during myogenesis (7Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Google Scholar, 8Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Google Scholar). As expected, Id mRNA level in 10T1/2-MyoD cells was decreased after 2 days in differentiation medium (Fig. 7C). In contrast, when LY294002 was added together with the differentiation medium, Id mRNA level was not down-regulated. This absence of Id down-regulation could explain at least in part the inability of MyoD to induce cell fusion and myogenin and p21 mRNA expression in LY294002-treated cells. In this study we have shown that two structurally different inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, i.e. LY294002 and wortmannin, blocked both the morphological and the biochemical differentiation of two skeletal muscle models, L6E9 myoblasts and 10T1/2 cells stably transfected with MyoD (10T1/2-MyoD). In a previous report, we showed that PI 3-kinase activity and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6E9 muscle cells were inhibited by 1 h treatment with wortmannin. The inhibition of insulin action was dose-dependent with an ED50 around 10-20 nM (32Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 471-477Google Scholar). Here we show that chronic treatment with LY294002 or wortmannin blocked both the morphological and the biochemical differentiation of L6E9 cells. PI 3-kinase inhibitors did not interfere with myoblast proliferation at the doses used (data not shown) and they did not cause any alteration in the elongation or alignment of myoblast observed during the first 24 h after serum deprivation. However, whereas untreated cells began to fuse a few hours after alignment, wortmannin- or LY294002-treated cells remained aligned but did not fuse into myotubes. PI 3-kinase also appears to be essential for signaling leading to the onset of muscle-specific gene expression. Thus, both wortmannin and LY294002 blocked the induction of myogenin mRNA levels and the exit from the cell cycle as measured by the lack of p21 mRNA expression. The induction of the skeletal muscle marker GLUT4 was also impaired without changes in the expression of two non-muscle-specific proteins: β1-integrin, an integral plasma membrane protein and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. This suggests that PI 3-kinase inhibitors only affected differentiation-associated events. Similar results were obtained when 10T1/2-MyoD cells were allowed to differentiate in the presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002: cells elongated but they were unable to fuse. Upon serum deprivation, untreated 10T1/2-MyoD cells formed multinucleate myotubes and induced the expression of myogenin and p21 mRNAs. In contrast, none of these myogenic characteristics was observed when 10T1/2-MyoD myoblasts were allowed to differentiate in the presence of LY294002. Our results seem to indicate that PI 3-kinase inhibitors prevented the activation of other muscle regulatory factors such as myf5 or MyoD, already expressed during the myoblast phenotype (43Muthuchamy M. Pajak L. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18728-18734Google Scholar). Indeed, this was the case in 10T1/2-MyoD cells where MyoD overexpression in undifferentiated cells did not bypass the inhibitory action of LY294002. It has been reported that the activity of muscle regulatory factors can be prevented by increasing the levels of Id protein or by silencing their transcriptional activity as a result of phosphorylation catalyzed by different kinases (15Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S. Weintraub H. Verma I.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 507-519Google Scholar, 16Li L. Chambard J.C. Karin M. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 676-689Google Scholar). In this study, we focused our attention on the dominant negative bHLH protein Id, which is normally down-regulated after serum deprivation but which remained expressed at high levels in LY294002-treated 10T1/2-MyoD cells. This blockade of Id down-regulation could explain, at least in part, the inability of overexpressed MyoD to induce differentiation. In all, our data implicate PI 3-kinase at an early step in the terminal differentiation of muscle cells and rule it out as an essential component in the control of proliferation of myoblast cells or the initial morphological changes associated with differentiation such as alignment and elongation of myoblasts. A schematic summary of our results is presented in Fig. 8. PI 3-kinases have been associated with many signal transduction pathways, indicating that this family of enzymes plays a variety of roles in response to different stimuli. Here we present results that strongly implicate PI 3-kinase activity in myogenesis. However, the precise myogenic mechanism(s) that are blocked by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors remain to be defined. At the moment, there is very scarce information regarding the signaling pathways by which the microenvironment influences myogenesis. Among the non-exclusive positive regulators of myogenesis that have been described are the insulin growth factors IGF-I, IGF-II, and their specific receptors, and also, the occupation of the extracellular matrix receptors integrins. The following observations allow us to postulate the involvement of PI 3-kinase(s) in myogenic signaling pathways. (i)Growth factors are generally considered to inhibit myogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 261-272Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that myoblasts in low serum medium initiate the expression of IGF-II which is secreted in significant amounts to the medium (44Florini J.R. Magri K.A. Ewton D.Z. James P.L. Grindstaff K. Rotwein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15917-15923Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and -II act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner on myoblasts to promote myogenic differentiation by interacting primarily with the IGF-I receptor (45Ewton D.Z. Falen S.L. Florini J.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 115-123Google Scholar). In this regard, IGF-binding proteins from muscle cells inhibit IGF-I-induced differentiation of L6E9 myoblasts (46Silverman L.A. Cheng Z.-Q. Hsiao D. Rosenthal S.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 720-726Google Scholar).The intracellular myogenic signaling process dependent on IGFs is poorly understood but it is known that IGF-I receptors associate through IRS-I with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. This interaction results in the activation of the enzyme (47Giorgetti S. Ballotti R. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Tartare S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7358-7364Google Scholar, 48Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.-M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the serine kinase activity of PI 3-kinase (49Tanti J.-F. Grémaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 17-21Google Scholar, 50Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Google Scholar). If such an association were also essential for myogenic signaling, PI 3-kinase inhibitors may block terminal differentiation at this level. On the other hand, IGF-II receptors have also been implicated in myogenesis by using the IGF-II receptor-selective (Leu-27) IGF-II analog (51Rosenthal S.M. Hsiao D. Silverman L.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 38-44Google Scholar) and, interestingly, wortmannin has been shown to block exocytosis of IGF-II receptors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (52Shepherd P.R. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 535-539Google Scholar).(ii)Integrins seem to play an important role in mediating signals from the extracellular matrix to influence myogenesis. Indeed, in the presence of a monoclonal antibody which blocks the function of the integrin β-subunit, myoblasts continue to replicate but do not fuse or express muscle-specific markers (17Menko A.S. Boettiger D. Cell. 1987; 51: 51-57Google Scholar). Myotube formation is also inhibited by antibodies against the integrin VLA-4 and its counter-receptor VCAM-1 (18Rosen G.D. Sanes J.R. LaChance R. Cunningham J.M. Roman J. Dean D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 1107-1119Google Scholar). Interestingly, an integrin-dependent translocation of PI 3-kinase to the cytoskeleton which involves specific interactions of p85α with actin filaments and focal adhesion kinase has been recently demonstrated in thrombin-stimulated platelets (53Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Google Scholar). Moreover, integrin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor regulate the association of PI 3-kinase with focal adhesion kinase in NIH3T3 cells (54Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Google Scholar). An analogous mechanism for PI 3-kinase activation via integrins in muscle cells would provide an explanation for the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on myogenic differentiation.(iii)Many reports have recently proposed a role for a mammalian PI 3-kinase in membrane trafficking. Indeed, wortmannin and/or LY294002 have been shown to disrupt GLUT1 trafficking in L6E9 myoblasts (32Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 471-477Google Scholar), to block exocytosis of IGF-II receptors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (52Shepherd P.R. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 535-539Google Scholar), and to inhibit the sorting and transport of lysosomal enzymes (55Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.C. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Google Scholar, 56Matsuoka K. Bassham D.C. Raikhel N.V. Nakamura K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1307-1318Google Scholar). Moreover, a mammalian homolog of the yeast PI 3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting Vps34p has been recently cloned (27Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Google Scholar). Thus, PI 3-kinase inhibitors could be blocking myogenesis by disrupting the intracellular trafficking of proteins involved in the myogenic signaling through IGFs and/or integrins although other regulatory mechanisms cannot be ruled out. In conclusion, these data suggest that one or more PI 3-kinase isoforms might be involved in the myogenic signaling through different positive effectors. We are now attempting to define the myogenic pathway(s) that depend on PI 3-kinase activity and to identify the isoform(s) of PI 3-kinase involved in myogenesis.

To identify receptor domains involved in determining ligand specificity, we created a series of chimeric MCP-1 and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted)/MIP-1α receptors that progressively interchanged the amino terminus and each of the three extracellular loops. Radiolabeled MCP-1 bound with high affinity to the wild-type MCP-1 receptor, but not to the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor (C-C CKR-1). Chimeras that retained the amino-terminal extension of the MCP-1 receptor bound MCP-1 with high affinity. In contrast, chimeric MCP-1 receptors, in which the wild-type amino terminus was replaced with the corresponding portion of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor, bound MCP-1 with low affinity. These data indicate that the amino terminus of the MCP-1 receptor is necessary for high affinity binding of the ligand. Very different results were obtained using the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor. Radiolabeled MIP-1α bound with high affinity to chimeras that expressed the extracellular loops of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor. In contrast to the MCP-1 receptor, substitution of the wild-type amino-terminal extension had little or no effect on MIP-1α binding. For the MCP-1, but not the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor, the presence of the wild-type amino terminus also significantly lowered the ligand concentration required for maximal signaling. We conclude that the amino-terminal extension of the MCP-1 receptor, but not the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor, is critically involved in ligand binding and signal transduction. These data reveal significant functional differences between the two C-C chemokine receptors and suggest a two-step mechanism for activation of the MCP-1 receptor.

Leukocyte chemotaxis to sites of inflammation and infection is initiated by the interaction of cytokines with G protein-coupled receptors (see Refs. 1Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev.

Corcoran B.A. Wahl S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1059-1062Google Scholar), and a family of chemotactic peptides known as the chemokines. Chemokines are 8-10-kDa basic heparin-binding proteins that are related by both primary structure and the presence of 4 conserved cysteine residues. In addition to chemotaxis, chemokines mediate leukocyte degranulation (6Baggiolini M. Dahinden C.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 127-133Google Scholar) and the up-regulation of adhesion receptors (7Vaddi K. Newton R.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4721-4732Google Scholar), and have recently been implicated in the suppression of human immunodeficiency virus replication (8Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Google Scholar). MCP-1 is a member of the C-C branch of the chemokine family in which the first 2 cysteine residues are adjacent. Other C-C chemokine members include RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and 1β (MIP-1α, MIP-1β), and the recently described eosinophil agonist, eotaxin (9Jose P.J. Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Collins P.D. Walsh D.T. Moqbel R. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Williams T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 881-887Google Scholar). Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a member of the C-X-C branch in which a single residue separates the first 2 cysteines, and lymphotaxin is a recently described chemokine in which only 2 cysteines are present (10Kelner G.S.

Two receptors for MCP-1 (MCP-1RA and MCP-1RB) have been cloned and are alternatively spliced variants of a single gene (11Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Google Scholar). A single receptor that binds both MIP-1α and RANTES (RANTES/MIP-1α receptor, also known as C-C CKR-1) has been cloned (12Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Google Scholar, 13Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Google Scholar), and there are recent reports of two additional C-C chemokine receptors that are highly expressed in eosinophils (14Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16491-16494Google Scholar) and basophils (15Power C.A. Meyer A. Nemeth K. Bacon K.B. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19495-19500Google Scholar), respectively. Each of these receptors is a seven-transmembrane domain receptor (16Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Google Scholar). The degree of identity between members of this superfamily of G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptors is 45-70%, with the greatest similarity occurring in the transmembrane domains, and the greatest divergence in the amino-terminal extension and three extracellular loops. The mechanism(s) of ligand binding and subsequent receptor activation of seven-transmembrane segment receptors are quite varied and appear to depend, in large part, on the size of the ligand (reviewed in Ref. 17Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Google Scholar). Small molecules such as retinal (18Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4923-4931Google Scholar) and catecholamines (19Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Google Scholar) are believed to interact with several charged residues in a hydrophilic pocket formed by the transmembrane domains of the receptor. In contrast, large glycoprotein hormones, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone (20Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Rapoport B. Science. 1990; 249: 1423-1425Google Scholar) and leutinizing hormone (21Moyle W.R. Bernard M.P. Myers R.V. Marko O.M. Strader C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10807-10812Google Scholar, 22Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13076-13079Google Scholar), bind with high affinity to long (350-400 residues) amino-terminal extensions of their respective receptors. In the case of small peptides (opiates (23Xue J.-C. Chen C. Zhu J. Kunapuli S. DeRiel J.K. Yu L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30195-30199Google Scholar), endothelin (24Adachi M.

The mechanism of receptor activation by the chemokines is not well understood, but studies of the binding of IL-8 (27Gayle III, R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Google Scholar) have implicated the amino-terminal extension and one or more extracellular loops as directly interacting with the ligands. We have investigated the sites of chemokine binding and activation of the MCP-1 and the RANTES/MIP-1α receptors. Taking advantage of the high degree of amino acid sequence conservation between these two receptors, we have created a series of chimeras in which the amino-terminal extension, and each of the three extracellular loops (including the transmembrane domains) of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor, were progressively substituted for the corresponding region of the MCP-1 receptor, and vice versa. In this paper, we report that the amino terminus of the MCP-1 receptor is necessary for high affinity binding of 125I-labeled MCP-1, but that other regions of the receptor are required to mediate signal transduction. In contrast, binding and signal transduction induced by MIP-1α do not appear to require the amino terminus, but do require the presence of the third extracellular loop of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor. These data suggest a two-step model in which high affinity binding of MCP-1 by the receptor amino terminus allows subsequent low affinity interactions with the extracellular loops/transmembrane domain bundles to effect receptor activation and signaling. Receptor chimeras were constructed from cDNAs of MCP-1R (Type B; Ref. 11Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Google Scholar) and the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor (12Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Google Scholar), and nucleotide (nt) numbers correspond to GenBank accession numbers U03905 and L10918, respectively. We chose to study the Type B, rather than the Type A receptor, because the latter is poorly expressed in HEK-293 cells. 2L.-M. Wong and I. F. Charo, unpublished data. Each receptor contains the prolactin signal sequence, followed by the Flag epitope sequence (32Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Google Scholar) fused immediately upstream of the second translation codon (nt 84, MCP-1R; and nt 66, C-C CKR-1). The prolactin signal/Flag sequence was subcloned into pBluescript and the receptor cDNA fused to the Flag sequence at a SalI site. A HindIII/NotI fragment of the MCP-1RB and RANTES/MIP-1αR constructs containing the leader sequence was then subcloned into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to yield the tagged wild-type receptors. The designations MMMM (MCP-1RB) and RRRR (RANTES/MIP-1αR) are used to represent the amino-terminal extension and each of the three extracellular loops of each receptor and chimera. Chimeras 1 and 2 were sequenced at the junctions used to create them by subcloning, and chimeras 3-6 were sequenced throughout the entire coding region to rule out mutations due to PCR amplification. Receptors with the amino-terminal extension exchanged were created by using a conserved ApaI site in RRRR and MMMM. An ApaI digest in MMMM and a partial digest in RRRR each yielded approximately a 1.8-kb fragment that was then subcloned into the ApaI site in RRRR and MMMM, respectively to yield RMMM and MRRR. Thus, in RMMM amino acids 1-32 are from the RANTES/MIP-1αR, while in MRRR amino acids 1-40 are from the MCP-1R. Amino acid numbers are from Ref. 11Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Google Scholar. Receptors that exchange the amino terminus and first extracellular loop was created by “overlapping PCR” (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). The complementary primers A (5′-agatacctggctattgtccacgc-3′) and B (5′-gcgtggacaatagccaggtatct-3′) correspond to the conserved sequence RYLAIVHA, nt 492-514 and 453-476 of MCP-1RB and RANTES/MIP-1αR, respectively. The amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal halves of MMMM and RRRR were amplified in one round of PCR. A second round of PCR was performed using vector-specific primers that flank the cDNA insert, and purified fragments of the amino-terminal half of MMMM and the carboxyl-terminal half of RRRR as templates to create MMRR. To generate chimera RRMM, a second round of PCR was performed using purified fragments of the amino-terminal half of RRRR and the carboxyl-terminal half of MMMM as templates. The amplified products were purified and digested with HindIII/NotI and cloned into the respective sites in pcDNA3. Thus in MMRR, amino acids 1-127 are from the MCP-1 receptor, and amino acids 1-120 in RRMM are from the RANTES/MIP-1αR. Receptors that exchange the amino terminus and first and second extracellular loops were also created by overlapping PCR. The complementary primers C (5′-tcatggtcatctgctac-3′) and D (5′-gtagcagatgaccatga-3′) correspond to the sequence MVICY, nt 730-746 and 703-719 of MCP-1RB and RANTES/MIP-1αR, respectively. The amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal halves of MMMM and RRRR were amplified in one round of PCR. A second round of PCR, using vector-specific primers that flank the cDNA insert and purified fragments of the amino-terminal half of MMMM and carboxyl-terminal half of RRRR as templates, was performed to generate MMMR. RRRM was constructed in the same manner. Thus in MMMR, residues 1-209 are from the MCP-1R, and in RRRM, amino acids 1-206 are from the RANTES/MIP-1αR. The amplified products were purified and digested with HindIII/NotI and cloned into the respective sites in pcDNA3. HEK-293 cells (1573-CRL, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in minimal essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 µg/ml and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, respectively. Cells were transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol and placed under antibiotic selection, 800 µg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Pools of G418-resistant cells were analyzed for cell surface expression of receptors by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Approximately 1 × 106 harvested cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with culture medium containing a Flag epitope-specific antibody (M1; IBI, New Haven, CT) diluted 1:1000. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in culture medium containing goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) diluted 1:1000 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Unbound antibody was removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus 20 µg/ml propidium iodide. Cell lines that expressed each of the constructs were selected for further study. MCP-1 and MIP-1α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were labeled using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (diiodide, DuPont NEN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of ligand in 10 µl of 100 mM sodium borate, pH 8.5, was incubated with 1.0 mCi of Bolton-Hunter reagent for 15 min on ice, and the reaction terminated by the addition of 100 µl of 0.5 M ethanolamine, 100 mM sodium borate, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% xylene cyanol. Unconjugated iodide was separated from labeled protein by elution using a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline and bovine serum albumin (1% w/v). Specific activity was determined by immunoassay (Quantikine; R&D) of the labeled protein and counting gamma emissions. The specific activity was typically 2200 Ci/mmol. Equilibrium binding was performed by adding 125I-labeled ligand, with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand, to 0.5 × 106 cells in polypropylene tubes in a total volume of 300 µl (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.0 mM CaCl2, 5.0 mM MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and incubating for 90 min at 27°C on an orbital shaking set shaking at 150 rpm. The cells were collected, using a Skatron cell harvester (Skatron Instruments Inc., Sterling, VA), on glass-fiber filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethylimine and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Unbound ligand was removed by washing with 4 ml of buffer (10 mM Hepes, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) over a period of 10 s. After washing, the filters were removed, and bound ligand was quantitated by counting γ emissions. Ligand binding by competition with unlabeled ligand was determined by incubation of 0.5 × 106 transfected cells (as above) with 1.5 nM radiolabeled ligand and addition of the indicated concentrations of unlabeled ligand to a final volume of 300 µl. The samples were collected, washed, and counted as above. The data were analyzed using the curve-fitting program Prism (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA) and the iterative nonlinear regression program LIGAND (34Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar). Inhibition adenylyl cyclase was assayed as described (35Myers S.J. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected HEK-93 cells were grown until confluent in 24-well tissue-culture dishes and labeled overnight with 2 µCi/ml [3H]adenine (25-30 Ci/mmol) in minimal essential medium-Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were stimulated by addition of fresh medium containing either chemokine alone, forskolin alone (10 µM, to activate adenylyl cyclase), or chemokine plus forskolin, all in the presence of 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, for 20 min at room temperature. The cAMP pool for each sample was normalized to its own ATP pool and expressed as a ratio by the equation (cAMP cpm/ATP cpm) × 100. In each experiment, full dose-response curves were generated and expressed as a percent of the maximal stimulation achieved by forskolin alone. All data points were determined in duplicate. To identify potential ligand-binding and signaling domains of the MCP-1 receptor, we utilized its high degree of relatedness to the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor. These two C-C chemokine receptors are 51% identical at the amino acid level but, with the exception of MCP-3 (36Franci C. Wong L.M. Van Damme J. Proost P. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6511-6517Google Scholar, 37Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Van Damme J. Tiffany H.L. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29671-29675Google Scholar), have little overlap in ligand specificity. MCP-1RB and the RANTES/MIP-1α-R are most highly related in their transmembrane domains (greater than 70% identical), but diverge considerably in their extracellular domains. We therefore generated a series of chimeric receptors in which the amino-terminal extensions and each of the three extracellular loops were progressively exchanged between the two receptors (Fig. 1). The wild-type MCP-1 receptor (Type B) is designated MMMM, to denote the amino terminus and each of its three extracellular loops. Similarly, the wild-type RANTES/MIP-1α receptor is designated RRRR. HEK-293 cells were stably transfected with the wild-type and chimeric receptors. The Flag epitope (DYKDDDD) (32Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Google Scholar) was added at the amino terminus of each receptor to allow determination of receptor expression. The addition of this 8-amino acid sequence did not alter the binding or signaling properties of the MCP-1 or RANTES/MIP-1α receptors (data not shown). Surface expression was assayed by flow cytometry. Cell lines in which the chimeras were expressed at the cell surface were selected for further study (Fig. 2). Two chimeras in which the amino terminus was completely removed (ΔMMM and ΔRRR) were not detected at the cell surface (data not shown). We first examined the specific binding of 125I-labeled MCP-1 and MIP-1α to constructs in which the amino-terminal extensions of the wild-type receptors were exchanged. Labeled MCP-1 bound well to the wild-type MCP-1 receptor (MMMM), as well as to the chimera MRRR, which contained only the amino terminus of the MCP-1 receptor (Fig. 3A). Analysis of these data by the method of Scatchard revealed essentially identical equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.33 nM for MMMM and 0.27 nM for MRRR (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the wild-type RANTES/MIP-1α receptor (RRRR), as well as the chimera (RMMM), failed to bind MCP-1 with high affinity (Fig. 3A). To determine if RRRR or RMMM bound MCP-1 with a lower affinity, we examined the ability of higher concentrations of unlabeled MCP-1 to compete with a fixed concentration of 125I-labeled MCP-1 for binding. As shown in Fig. 3C, MCP-1 did bind specifically to RMMM, but with a significantly lower affinity (Kd = 3.5 nM) as compared to chimeras with the amino terminus of the wild-type receptor. There was minimal binding to RRRR and no specific binding to untransfected HEK-293 cells. We conclude from these data that the amino-terminal extension of the MCP-1 receptor is necessary for high affinity binding of MCP-1 and that MCP-1 also interacts with a second site on the receptor with lower affinity. In contrast, the amino terminus of the RANTES/MIP-1αR was not important for high affinity binding of MIP-1α. Radiolabeled MIP-1α bound with high affinity to the wild-type receptor (RRRR, Kd = 0.58 nM), as well as to the construct that exchanged the receptor's amino terminus (MRRR, Kd = 0.69 nM) (Fig. 4). There was no detectable specific binding (in either direct or in competition binding assays) to the wild-type MCP-1 receptor (MMMM) or to the construct that substituted the amino terminus of the RANTES/MIP-1αR onto the MCP-1 receptor (RMMM). We conclude from these data that one or more of the extracellular loops, but not the amino terminus, of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor is necessary for high affinity binding. As a further test of the hypothesis that MCP-1 and MIP-1α bind to different regions of their respective receptors, we took advantage of the fact that the chimera MRRR bound both ligands with high affinity (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). In competition studies, unlabeled MCP-1, but not MIP-1α, blocked the binding of 125I-labeled MCP-1 to MRRR (Fig. 5). Similarly, unlabeled MIP-1α, but not MCP-1, blocked the binding of radiolabeled MIP-1α to MRRR. These data strongly suggest that MCP-1 and MIP-1α bind to different regions of MRRR and are consistent with MCP-1 binding to the amino terminus and MIP-1α binding to one or more of the extracellular loops of their respective receptors. We have shown previously that MCP-1RB and the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor couple via Gαi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and lower intracellular levels of cAMP (35Myers S.J. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Google Scholar). In the next series of experiments, we examined the ability of the chimeric receptors to mediate signal transduction in response to MCP-1 and MIP1-α. The wild-type MCP-1 receptor signaled well in response to MCP-1 (IC50 = 0.2 nM), as expected (Fig. 6 and Ref. 35Myers S.J. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Google Scholar). There was little or no response of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor (RRRR) to MCP-1, in agreement with published results (35Myers S.J. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Google Scholar). Substitution of the amino terminus of the MCP-1 receptor onto the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor, however, resulted in a dramatic increase in response to MCP-1 (compare MRRR, IC50 = 7.4 nM to RRRR, IC50 > 100 nM) (Fig. 6). Similarly, substitution of the amino terminus of the MCP-1 receptor resulted in a greater than 30-fold loss in MCP-1 responsiveness (compare chimera RMMM, IC50 = 7.7 nM to MMMM, IC50 = 0.2 nM) (Fig. 6). These data are consistent with a critical role for the amino-terminal extension of the MCP-1 receptor in ligand binding and signal transduction and further suggest that the low affinity binding of MCP-1 to RMMM is sufficient to mediate signaling, albeit at higher ligand concentrations. In contrast, the amino terminus of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor was not essential for receptor signaling. In response to MIP-1α, signaling of the chimera MRRR was reduced only 2-3-fold as compared to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 7: MRRR, IC50 = 0.26 nM; RRRR, IC50 = 0.11 nM). Little or no inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was mediated by RMMM or MMMM in response to MIP-1α (Fig. 7). Similar results were obtained when mobilization of intracellular calcium was assayed as a measure of signaling, or when RANTES was used instead of MIP-1α (data not shown). We conclude that the amino-terminal extension of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor is not critically involved in ligand binding or receptor signaling. Four additional constructs that interchanged the amino terminus plus the first extracellular loop (RRMM and MMRR, see Fig. 1) or the amino terminus plus the first two extracellular loops (RRRM and MMMR) were examined for their ability to bind and signal in response to MCP-1 and MIP-1α. Binding experiments with radiolabeled MCP-1 confirmed that the amino-terminal extension was responsible for virtually all of the high affinity binding (Table I). Furthermore, there was no detectable binding of MCP-1 to RRMM or RRRM in either direct or competition binding experiments (Table I).Table I.Binding and signaling characteristics of chimeric receptorsCyclase inhibition IC50Equilibrium BindingKdBmaxMCP-1MIP-1αMCP-1MIP-1αnmnmfmol/106 cellsReceptorMMMM0.2 (0.14)NDaND, not detectable.0.33 (0.12)ND2.8 (1.3)MMMR0.4 (0.1)1.97 (0.9)0.36 (0.17)24.0 (4.7)1.1 (0.2)MMRR1.4 (1.2)0.46 (0.14)0.28 (0.10)4.1 (2.6)4.2 (1.4)MRRR7.4 (1.3)0.26 (0.12)0.27 (0.10)0.69 (0.24)4.9 (1.8)RRRR>1000.11 (0.06)5.00 (1.5)0.58 (0.10)3.9 (1.9)RRRMNDNDNDNDRRMMNDNDNDNDRMMM7.7 (1.3)ND3.50 (0.98)ND4.2 (1.8)a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab The results of signaling experiments suggested that each of the three extracellular loops contributed to the agonist-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by MCP-1. Thus, the chimera MMRR, which contained the amino terminus and first extracellular loop, had an IC50 of 1.4 nM, whereas MMMR, which contained the amino terminus plus the first and second extracellular loops, had an IC50 = 0.4 nM (Fig. 7), despite its relatively low expression level at the cell surface (Fig. 2). As previously shown in Fig. 6, the chimera MRRR (with all three loops substituted) was the least active of this series of constructs, and the wild-type receptor (MMMM), which contained all three extracellular loops, had an IC50 = 0.2 nM. The chimeras RRMM and RRRM, which lacked the first and second extracellular loops, respectively (as well as the amino-terminal extension), failed to signal (Fig. 8), although each of these constructs was expressed at least as well as the wild-type receptors at the cell surface. These results are summarized in Table I. In contrast to the MCP-1 receptor in which each of the three loops as well as the amino-terminal extension contributed to signal transduction, the third extracellular loop of the RANTES/MIP-1α receptor was especially critical for signaling. Virtually no inhibition of adenylyl cyclase could be detected using the chimera RRRM, whereas MMMR, whi"
https://openalex.org/W2047797038,"The 180-kDa transmembrane tyrosine kinase ErbB-4 is a receptor for the growth factor heregulin. 125I-Heregulin binding to NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing the ErbB-4 receptor is rapidly decreased by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) pretreatment. Immunologic analysis demonstrates that TPA treatment of cells induces the proteolytic cleavage of ErbB-4, producing an 80-kDa cytoplasmic domain fragment, which contains a low level of phosphotyrosine, and a 120-kDa ectodomain fragment, which is released into the extracellular medium. Cleavage of ErbB-4 was also enhanced by other protein kinase C activators, i.e. platelet-derived growth factor, ionomycin, and synthetic diacylglycerol, while protein kinase C inhibition or down-regulation suppressed the TPA stimulation of ErbB-4 degradation. TPA did not induce the degradation of related receptors (ErbB-1, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3) in the EGF receptor family. The phorbol ester-induced cleavage of ErbB-4 occurs within or close to the ectodomain, as the 80-kDa cytoplasmic domain fragment is recognized by antibody to the ErbB-4 carboxyl terminus and is membrane-associated. Coprecipitation experiments show that, while the 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment is associated with the SH2-containing molecules PLC-γ1 and Shc, TPA did not induce the phosphorylation of these substrates in intact cells. In addition, kinase assays in vitro indicate that the 80-kDa fragment is not an active tyrosine kinase. These results show that protein kinase C negatively regulates heregulin signaling through the ErbB-4 receptor by the activation of a selective proteolytic mechanism."

INTRODUCTIONNuclear receptors are transcription factors which mediate signals of a variety of hormones. Upon ligand binding, the receptors activate transcription by interacting with specific DNA sequences located within or near gene promoters.All members of the nuclear receptor superfamily bind with high affinity to directly or inversely repeated DNA sequences (1Zilliacus J. Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Google Scholar) by the DNA-binding domain (DBD) 1The abbreviations used are: DBDDNA-binding domainER/GR/PR/MR/ARestrogen, glucocorticoid, progesterone, mineralocorticoid, and androgen receptorPBprobasinpbprobasin geneGRE/PRE/MRE/AREglucocorticoid, progesterone, mineralocorticoid, and androgen response elementDR/IRdirect/inverted repeatMMTV LTRmouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeatCRP1 and CRP2footprint of the AR-DBD on the promoter of the cystatin-related peptide genes 1 and 2fIXARE sequence of the factor IX gene promoterPSAARE from the promoter of the prostate-specific antigen genehGK1ARE from the promoter of the human glandular kallikrein gene 1CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasetkthymidine kinase. which contains two zinc-finger motifs. Mader et al. (2Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Google Scholar) have demonstrated that differences between the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the estrogen receptor (ER) involving three amino acids located in the so-called P-box, are responsible for the difference in sequence recognition. The GR recognizes the sequence 5′-TGTTCT-3′, while the ER interacts with the 5′-TGACCT-3′ element.Within the subfamily of steroid receptors, the glucocorticoid, progesterone (PR), mineralocorticoid (MR), and androgen receptors (AR) are closely related (3Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar). Several observations indicate that the GR, PR, MR, and AR recognize the same DNA elements. Firstly, the P- and D-boxes of the GR, PR, MR, and AR are conserved (4Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7211-7215Google Scholar); secondly, all four receptors have been shown to bind to different glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) (5Lombès M. Binart N. Oblin M.-E. Joulin V. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 577-583Google Scholar, 6De Vos P. Claessens F. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: R11-R16Google Scholar, 7Lieberman B.A. Bona B.J. Edwards D.P. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 515-527Google Scholar); and thirdly, in transient transfection experiments, all four receptors can transactivate transcription of reporter genes through these elements (5Lombès M. Binart N. Oblin M.-E. Joulin V. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 577-583Google Scholar, 8Ham J. Thomson A. Needham M. Webb P. Parker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5263-5276Google Scholar). Indeed, most GREs are imperfect palindromes of the core sequence 5′-TGTTCT-3′, and they have been shown to act as progesterone, mineralocorticoid, or androgen response elements (PREs, MREs, or AREs) (5Lombès M. Binart N. Oblin M.-E. Joulin V. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 577-583Google Scholar, 7Lieberman B.A. Bona B.J. Edwards D.P. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 515-527Google Scholar, 8Ham J.

In conclusion, it has been stated that GRE, PRE, MRE, and AREs are not receptor-specific (1Zilliacus J. Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Google Scholar, 10Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Google Scholar). This is, however, in contrast with the observation that in a specific cell type, different steroids evoke different specific in vivo effects. The molecular mechanisms underlying these cell-specific steroid responses are of particular interest in cell types which co-express related receptors. Several mechanisms might account for these specificities, including tissue-specific ligand metabolism, regulation of receptor level, or receptor-specific interactions with auxiliary factors which modulate receptor function (11Gordon D.A. Chamberlain N.L. Flomerfeld F.A. Miesfeld R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 368-377Google Scholar, 12Roy A.K. Chatterjee B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 157-176Google Scholar).The transcription of the probasin gene (pb) and the C3(1) gene in rat prostate is androgen-inducible in vivo. In both genes, AREs have been described: the C3(1) gene contains an ARE (C3(1)ARE) as part of an androgen-responsive unit in the first intron (13Claessens F. Celis L. Peeters B. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 833-840Google Scholar, 14Celis L. Claessens F. Peeters B. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 165-172Google Scholar), and in the probasin gene promoter two AREs have been found (PB-ARE-1 and −2 (15Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Leco K.J. Sheppard P.C. McQueen S.A. Cheng H. Snoek R. Hamel A. Bock M.E. MacDonald B.S. Nickel B.E. Chang C. Liao S. Cattini P.A. Matusik R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 23-36Google Scholar)).Here we describe that the DBDs of the AR and the GR (6De Vos P. Claessens F. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: R11-R16Google Scholar, 16De Vos P. Claessens F. Winderickx J. Van Dijck P. Celis L. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3439-3443Google Scholar) bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Most AREs or AR-binding sequences display a similar relative affinity for both DBDs. The C3(1)ARE, for example, has a high affinity for both the AR-DBD and the GR-DBD. In contrast, the GR-DBD does not recognize the PB-ARE-2 nor several other derived artificial sequences. The difference in affinity is reflected in functional assays, in which the PB-ARE-2 element acts as ARE and not GRE in conditions were the C3(1)ARE construct is responsive to both androgens and glucocorticoids.This is the first report of a simple ARE which is specifically recognized by the AR and therefore provides evidence for one of the older hypotheses put forward to explain steroid specificity of in vivo responses, i.e. the existence of receptor-specific response elements (17Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Promega, and Boehringer Mannheim.

Procedures for expression in Escherichia coli and subsequent purification of the proteins have been described elsewhere (6De Vos P. Claessens F. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Mol.

The only modification applied here was the addition of 1 µM ZnCl2 to the lysis buffer, which resulted in an increase of the affinity of the prepared proteins for DNA. To exclude variations in quality of proteins, experiments were repeated with three independent protein preparations. No clear differences have been observed.DNA binding was studied by gel retardation analysis. Constant amounts of the labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with increasing amounts of the fusion protein in 20 µl of binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 1 µg of poly(dI/dC), 0.1% Triton, 1 mM dithiothreitol). Subsequently, free probe was separated from bound probe by a 90-min electrophoresis at 120 V in a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel.The African green monkey kidney cell line CV-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37°C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.9 g/liter glucose, 10 mM Hepes, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal calf serum (Seralab).

Upon ligand binding, the receptors activate transcription by interacting with specific DNA sequences located within or near gene promoters.All members of the nuclear receptor superfamily bind with high affinity to directly or inversely repeated DNA sequences (1Zilliacus J.

Mader et al. (2Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Google Scholar) have demonstrated that differences between the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the estrogen receptor (ER) involving three amino acids located in the so-called P-box, are responsible for the difference in sequence recognition. The GR recognizes the sequence 5′-TGTTCT-3′, while the ER interacts with the 5′-TGACCT-3′ element.Within the subfamily of steroid receptors, the glucocorticoid, progesterone (PR), mineralocorticoid (MR), and androgen receptors (AR) are closely related (3Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar). Several observations indicate that the GR, PR, MR, and AR recognize the same DNA elements. Firstly, the P- and D-boxes of the GR, PR, MR, and AR are conserved (4Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7211-7215Google Scholar); secondly, all four receptors have been shown to bind to different glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) (5Lombès M. Binart N. Oblin M.-E. Joulin V. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 577-583Google Scholar, 6De Vos P. Claessens F. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 515-527Google Scholar); and thirdly, in transient transfection experiments, all four receptors can transactivate transcription of reporter genes through these elements (5Lombès M. Binart N. Oblin M.-E. Joulin V. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 577-583Google Scholar, 8Ham J. Thomson A. Needham M. Webb P. Parker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5263-5276Google Scholar). Indeed, most GREs are imperfect palindromes of the core sequence 5′-TGTTCT-3′, and they have been shown to act as progesterone, mineralocorticoid, or androgen response elements (PREs, MREs, or AREs) (5Lombès M. Binart N. Oblin M.-E. Joulin V. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 577-583Google Scholar, 7Lieberman B.A. Bona B.J. Edwards D.P. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 515-527Google Scholar, 8Ham J.

In conclusion, it has been stated that GRE, PRE, MRE, and AREs are not receptor-specific (1Zilliacus J. Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Google Scholar, 10Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Google Scholar). This is, however, in contrast with the observation that in a specific cell type, different steroids evoke different specific in vivo effects. The molecular mechanisms underlying these cell-specific steroid responses are of particular interest in cell types which co-express related receptors. Several mechanisms might account for these specificities, including tissue-specific ligand metabolism, regulation of receptor level, or receptor-specific interactions with auxiliary factors which modulate receptor function (11Gordon D.A. Chamberlain N.L. Flomerfeld F.A. Miesfeld R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 368-377Google Scholar, 12Roy A.K. Chatterjee B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 157-176Google Scholar).The transcription of the probasin gene (pb) and the C3(1) gene in rat prostate is androgen-inducible in vivo. In both genes, AREs have been described: the C3(1) gene contains an ARE (C3(1)ARE) as part of an androgen-responsive unit in the first intron (13Claessens F. Celis L. Peeters B. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 833-840Google Scholar, 14Celis L. Claessens F. Peeters B. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 165-172Google Scholar), and in the probasin gene promoter two AREs have been found (PB-ARE-1 and −2 (15Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Leco K.J. Sheppard P.C. McQueen S.A. Cheng H.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 23-36Google Scholar)).Here we describe that the DBDs of the AR and the GR (6De Vos P. Claessens F. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: R11-R16Google Scholar, 16De Vos P. Claessens F. Winderickx J. Van Dijck P. Celis L. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3439-3443Google Scholar) bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Most AREs or AR-binding sequences display a similar relative affinity for both DBDs. The C3(1)ARE, for example, has a high affinity for both the AR-DBD and the GR-DBD. In contrast, the GR-DBD does not recognize the PB-ARE-2 nor several other derived artificial sequences. The difference in affinity is reflected in functional assays, in which the PB-ARE-2 element acts as ARE and not GRE in conditions were the C3(1)ARE construct is responsive to both androgens and glucocorticoids.This is the first report of a simple ARE which is specifically recognized by the AR and therefore provides evidence for one of the older hypotheses put forward to explain steroid specificity of in vivo responses, i.e. the existence of receptor-specific response elements (17Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Google Scholar)."

Sphingomyelin, an important constituent of HDL, may regulate the activity of LCAT at any of the key steps of the enzymatic reaction: binding of LCAT to the interface, activation by apo A-I, or inhibition at the catalytic site. In order to clarify the role of sphingomyelin in the regulation of the LCAT reaction and its effects on the structure of apolipoprotein A-I, we prepared reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and up to 22 mol % sphingomyelin. Because the interfacial properties of substrate particles can dramatically affect LCAT binding and kinetics, we also prepared and analyzed proteoliposome substrates having the same components as the rHDL, except for a 4-fold higher ratio of phospholipid to apolipoprotein A-I. The reaction kinetics of LCAT with the rHDL particles revealed no significant change in the apparent Vmax but showed a concentration-dependent increase in slope of the reciprocal plots and in the apparent Km values with sphingomyelin content. The dissociation constant (Kd) for LCAT with these particles increased linearly with sphingomyelin content up to 22 mol %, changing in parallel with the apparent Km values. No structural changes of apolipoprotein A-I were detected in the particles with increasing content of sphingomyelin, but fluorescence results with lipophilic probes revealed that significant changes in the acyl chain, backbone, and head group regions of the lipid bilayer of the particles are introduced by the addition of sphingomyelin. On the other hand, the proteoliposome substrates also had increased Kd values for LCAT at high sphingomyelin contents but compared with the rHDL particles had a 6-10-fold lower affinity for LCAT binding and exhibited kinetics consistent with competitive inhibition by sphingomyelin at the active site. These results show conclusively that the dominant mechanism for the inhibition of LCAT activity with rHDL particles by sphingomyelin is the impaired binding of the enzyme to the interface.

LCAT participates in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, maintaining a gradient for the diffusion of free cholesterol from peripheral tissues into high density lipoproteins (HDL) by catalyzing cholesterol ester (CE) formation from HDL surface phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterol. As a result of LCAT activity, cholesterol is removed from peripheral cell membranes and, as CE, is ultimately removed and metabolized by the liver. lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase cholesterol ester phosphatidylcholine high density lipoproteins apolipoprotein A-I reconstituted HDL sphingomyelin dipalmitoyl-PC dimyristoyl-PC 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene 1-(4-trimethyl-ammonium phenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene 6-propionyl-2(dimethylamino)naphthalene. Several factors contribute to the maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis, including the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and acyl-CoA acyltransferase, which are responsible for production and esterification of intracellular cholesterol, respectively. In addition, the sphingomyelin (SPM) content of the cell membrane is thought to contribute to the maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. The cholesterol content of the cell membranes is positively correlated with SPM content (1Barenholz Y. Gatt S. Hawthorne J.N. Ansell G.B. Phospholipids. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 129Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin is thought to bind cholesterol with high affinity and inhibit its efflux from the plasma membrane by preventing cholesterol desorption (2Lund-Katz S. Laboda H.M. McLean L.M. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3416-3423Google Scholar); SPM also prevents the exchange of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and intracellular pools (3Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Google Scholar). Although its role in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis has become more clearly established, the role of SPM in the function of circulating lipoproteins remains unclear. In the vasculature, LCAT encounters several potential substrate particles containing lipids (PC, cholesterol). LCAT activity with these particles is determined primarily by their apolipoprotein and lipid content and composition. Optimal substrates appear to be small HDL particles containing apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) (4Glomset J. Nelson G. Blood Lipids and Lipoproteins. Wiley, New York1972: 745Google Scholar), the principal physiological activator of LCAT (5Fielding C.J. Shore V.G. Fielding P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 1493-1498Google Scholar), whereas apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins are poor substrates (6Barter P.J. Hopkins G.J. Gorjatschko L. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 58: 97-107Google Scholar). The activity of LCAT with these lipoproteins is inversely proportional to the size of the low density lipoproteins particles and is directly proportional to the PC/SPM ratio (7Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Google Scholar). The PC/SPM ratio correlates with LCAT activity on blood components: the PC/SPM ratio in HDL is higher (≈6.5/1) than in low density lipoproteins (≈2.6/1) or RBC membranes(≈1.2/1) (8Skipski V. Nelson G.J. Blood Lipids and Lipoproteins: Quantitation, Composition, and Metabolism. Wiley Interscience, New York1972: 471Google Scholar). When SPM levels in HDL are increased, LCAT activity is reduced. Discoidal lymphatic HDL from humans (9Reichl D. Sterchi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 28-32Google Scholar) and dogs (10Dory L. Sloop C.H. Boquet L.M. Hamilton R.L. Roheim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3489-3493Google Scholar) are enriched in SPM and have low LCAT reactivity relative to their plasma counterparts. Furthermore, the apoA-I of discoidal human lymphatic HDL has an altered epitope expression compared with discoidal rHDL particles, suggesting that the altered lipid composition of lymphatic HDL promotes an apoA-I conformation that may render it incapable of activating LCAT (11Wong L. Curtiss L.K. Huang J. Mann C.J. Maldonado B. Roheim P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2370-2375Google Scholar). Clearly, structural and compositional differences of lymphatic HDL contribute to their lower reactivity with LCAT. The phospholipid content of HDL could dramatically alter LCAT activity by interacting with and changing the conformation of apoA-I, by changing the nature of the lipid interface, by inhibiting LCAT through competition for substrate binding at the active site, or by a combination of the above. It is possible that the presence of SPM in HDL alters LCAT reactivity by several of these mechanisms. In addition to its effects in native lipoproteins, SPM has been shown to be a poor matrix for the LCAT reaction with synthetic substrates. In fact, LCAT activity is lower with PC regardless of the acyl chain composition when the PC is presented in an SPM matrix compared with a fluid ether PC matrix (12Pownall H. Pao Q. Massey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2146-2152Google Scholar). Research by Subbaiah and Liu (13Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20156-20163Google Scholar) using proteoliposome substrates and native lipoproteins suggests that SPM competes with PC for binding to the active site of LCAT and thus participates in the regulation of the LCAT reaction. Although proteoliposomes are useful as substrates for LCAT in vitro, they lack the defined apoA-I structures characteristic of discoidal reconstituted HDL (rHDL) and have very different structures from native HDL. In order to clarify the role of SPM in the regulation of the LCAT reaction and its effects on the structure of apoA-I, we have prepared discoidal rHDL with egg PC, cholesterol, and apoA-I containing up to 22 mol % SPM. We have characterized these particles in terms of protein structure and properties of the lipid components and the lipid-water interface. We examined the structure of apoA-I and the binding affinity and reaction kinetics of LCAT with these particles. Our results suggest that in discoidal rHDL particles SPM introduces changes in the structure of the lipids, decreases the binding of LCAT to the substrate particles, and thus regulates the LCAT reaction. In contrast, proteoliposome substrates bind more weakly to LCAT and experience the regulatory effect of SPM not only at the binding step but also at the catalytic step. Human LCAT was purified by methods described previously (14Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Google Scholar, 15Jonas A. McHugh H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10335-10340Google Scholar). Its average specific activity, using standard rHDL substrates, was around 100 nmol CE/hr/µg LCAT, and it remained fully active over an 8-month period. Human apoA-I was prepared using a modification of the method of Nichols et al. (16Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Anderson D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 226-239Google Scholar). Egg PC, egg SPM, cholesterol, and sodium cholate were obtained from Sigma. Radiolabeled [4-14C]cholesterol and 3H-labeled [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (3H-DPPC) were purchased from DuPont NEN. The rHDL were prepared using the sodium cholate dialysis method (17Jonas A. Matz C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6867-6872Google Scholar) in molar ratios of 80:8:1:80, egg PC/cholesterol/apoA-I/cholate, or in ratios ranging from 74:(4):8:1:80 to 51:(17):8:1:80 when prepared with SPM (given in parenthesis). Proteolipsome preparations contained 312:5:1:936 molar ratios of egg PC/cholesterol/apoA-I/cholate, or ratios of 275:(37):5:1:936 and 234:(78):5:1:936 when containing SPM (in parenthesis). Radiolabeled cholesterol (5,000 cpm/nmol) was incorporated only into the particle preparations that were used for the determination of reaction kinetics with LCAT. Radiolabeled 3H-DPPC (20,000 cpm/nmol of cholesterol) was included in the preparation of the standard substrate for the activity inhibition measurements (18Bolin D.J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7429-7434Google Scholar). Cholate was removed by exhaustive dialysis against 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.0005% EDTA, 0.15 NaCl, 1 mM NaN3, pH 8.0 buffer at 4°C. Diameters of rHDL were determined by nondenaturing 8-25% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (Pharmacia PHAST gradient gel electrophoresis). Phosphatidylcholine was separated from SPM and cholesterol by TLC (Analtech Analytical) using chloroform/methanol/ammonia (65:25:4, v/v/v) and quantified using the method of Chen et al. (19Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar). Protein content was determined from absorbance at 280 nm using the percentage extinction coefficient for apoA-I, 11.5 × 102 g−1 cm2 (20Gwynne J. Brewer Jr., B. Edelhoch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2411-2416Google Scholar) and by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Egg PC/C or SPM/C vesicles were prepared in ratios of 10:1, phospholipid/cholesterol. Preparations were dried down and dispersed in 10 ml of standard buffer. The samples were sonicated on ice (egg PC) or at 50°C (SPM) until they cleared, alternating 3 min of sonication with 1-min rest periods. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 15°C for 1 h. The phospholipid content of the supernatant (~5 mg/ml) was assessed by the method of Chen (19Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar) and with a standard phospholipid assay kit (Wako Phospholipids B). The vesicles were used immediately following the preparation. LCAT affinity for the rHDL and proteoliposome particles was assessed by the activity inhibition assay previously described (18Bolin D.J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7429-7434Google Scholar). Briefly, the activity inhibition assay uses rHDL containing 3H-DPPC as substrates for the LCAT reaction. When unlabeled rHDL or proteoliposomes are present in the reaction mixture, LCAT equilibrates between labeled and unlabeled rHDL, and the total radiolabeled CE production is decreased. Lineweaver-Burke plots of reciprocal velocity versus reciprocal substrate apolipoprotein concentration give a family of lines that are consistent with the pattern expected for competitive inhibition. Plots of the slopes of these lines versus the concentration of apolipoprotein in the competing rHDL give a straight line from which the Ki (Kd, the dissociation constant) for the competing rHDL can be obtained. The substrates used were the egg PC/cholesterol/apoA-I rHDL prepared as described above including 3H-DPPC. The LCAT reaction mixture consisted of rHDL or proteoliposomes with substrate apoA-I contents ranging from 2.5 to 43 µg, 2 mg of defatted bovine serum albumin, 4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, unlabeled test rHDL or proteoliposomes with apolipoprotein contents ranging from 0 to 150 µg, and standard buffer to 0.45 ml of total volume. When vesicles were analyzed for LCAT binding, 9 µg of substrate apoA-I were included, and vesicle phospholipid contents from 0 up to 0.95 mg (egg PC) or 1.56 mg (SPM) were used as inhibitors; the remainder of the reaction mixture was unchanged. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 5 min, and 50 µl of a suitable LCAT dilution were added to start the reaction. The reaction proceeded 20 min and was stopped by the addition of 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Labeled CE were separated from cholesterol and phospholipids by thin layer chromatography and were quantitated by scintillation counting as described previously (14Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Google Scholar, 17Jonas A. Matz C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6867-6872Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in duplicate on two separate particle preparations. LCAT reactions with rHDL or proteoliposomes containing [4-14C]cholesterol were performed in standard buffer as reported previously (22Jonas A. Sweeney S.A. Herbert P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6369-6375Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures for kinetic analysis contained substrate concentrations ranging from 1 × 10−7M (2.8 µg) to 3 × 10−6M (84 µg) apoA-I, 2 mg of defatted bovine serum albumin, 4 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 30-50 ng of pure LCAT. Apparent kinetic constants were obtained from Lineweaver-Burke analysis of the data. Experiments on two separate preparations were performed in duplicate, each giving similar results. A more detailed analysis of the effects of an interfacial inhibitor on the enzyme kinetics was based on the following expression derived by Verger et al. (23Verger R. Mieras M.C.E. deHaas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4023-4034Google Scholar) and applied by Jonas et al. (24Jonas A. Daehler J.L. Wilson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2757-2762Google Scholar) to the inhibition of LCAT by ether PC: 1vo=Km∗+Km∗(IKi∗)+SKcatEoS+Km∗KdKcatEo·1So In this expression, vo is the initial velocity; Km* is the intrinsic Michaelis-Menten constant (in molecules/surface); I is the inhibitor concentration (in molecules/surface); Ki* is the intrinsic inhibition constant; S is the interfacial substrate concentration (in molecules/surface); Kcat is the catalytic rate constant, Eo is the total enzyme concentration (in molecules/volume); Kd is the dissociation constant of the enzyme from the interface; and So is the bulk substrate concentration (in molecules/volume). According to this equation, in the presence of an interfacial inhibitor, reciprocal plots of vo versus bulk PC concentration should give a family of straight lines with an increasing 1/vo intercept, i.e. decreasing apparent Vmax values. The slope of the lines should be constant if Kd remains the same. However, changes in Kd would give increasing or decreasing slopes. The lipid dynamics and hydration of the rHDL containing SPM were examined using fluorescent probes. The motions and polarity of the environment of the acyl chain, glycerol backbone, and head group regions were assessed using 1,3,5 diphenylhexatriene (DPH), trimethylammonium-DPH (TMA-DPH), and 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (PRODAN), respectively. All fluorescent lipophilic probes were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fluorescence measurements and analysis of the data were performed as described previously (25Wald J.H. Goormaghtigh E. De Meutter J. Ruysschaert J.M. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20044-20050Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were measured with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter at 24°C between 200 and 250 nm using 0.1 mg/ml sample solutions and a 1-mm path length cuvette. The α-helical content of apo A-I in the rHDL particles containing SPM was estimated from the molar ellipticities at 222 nm using the method of Chen et al. (26Chen Y. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Google Scholar) as previously reported (27Jonas A. von Eckardstein A. Churgay L. Mantulin W.M. Assmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 202-210Google Scholar). Two separate fluorescence experiments were performed, each giving similar results. ApoA-I has been shown to combine with a variety of phospholipids, including SPM, to form stable discoidal rHDL particles (12Pownall H. Pao Q. Massey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2146-2152Google Scholar, 28Bonomo E.A. Swaney J.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5094-5103Google Scholar, 29Zorich N. Kezdy K.E. Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 181-189Google Scholar, 30Swaney J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1254-1259Google Scholar). Table I summarizes the properties of rHDL particles prepared in this study; their size distribution is shown in Fig. 1. The composition and size of the rHDL particles are consistent with a discoidal morphology (31Leroy A. Toohill K.L.H. Fruchart J.C. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4798-4805Google Scholar). The moderate content of egg SPM, with saturated acyl chains (86% palmitoyl) (32Calhoun W.I. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1717-1721Google Scholar), does not appear to alter significantly the structure of apoA-I. Circular dichroism spectra for all of the rHDL in this series were quite similar (data not shown) indicating that the α-helical content of apoA-I changes very little, as shown on Table I. It is clear that rHDL particles with similar size and total lipid contents can be prepared with apoA-I and mixtures of egg PC and SPM. The proteoliposome preparations had protein and lipid compositions very similar to those of the initial reaction mixtures and migrated on nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as heterogeneous populations of particles most having diameters greater than 180 Å (data not shown).Table I.Characterization of the rHDL particlesSPMaPC was separated from SPM by TLC (Analtech Analytical) using chloroform/methanol/ammonia (65:25:4, v/v/v) and quantified using the method of Chen et al.

Open table in a new tab LCAT reactivity with rHDL is highly dependent upon the phospholipid composition of the interface of the substrate particle. SPM provides a poor matrix for the LCAT reaction when it is present as 89% of the interfacial phospholipid (12Pownall H. Pao Q. Massey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2146-2152Google Scholar). To determine the effect of SPM incorporated into discoidal rHDL or into proteoliposomes on the LCAT reaction, we used the two series of substrates containing [4-14C]cholesterol. Lineweaver-Burke plots for the enzymatic reactions are shown in Fig. 2. The resulting kinetic parameters are summarized in Table II. We found (Fig. 2B) that increasing SPM content in the rHDL had a minimal effect on the apparent Vmax (appVmax) of the LCAT reaction. The insignificant change in appVmax in this rHDL series suggests that SPM competition with PC for the LCAT active site is minimal in these substrates. However, the increasing slopes of the Lineweaver-Burke plots with SPM content clearly indicate, by reference to the analysis of interfacial enzyme inhibition of Verger et al. (23Verger R. Mieras M.C.E. deHaas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4023-4034Google Scholar) and the work of Jonas et al. (24Jonas A. Daehler J.L. Wilson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2757-2762Google Scholar), that the major effect is on the Km*Kd/KcatEo parameters. Because the Km* and the KcatEo parameters of the catalytic step are in effect constants, then Kd is the likely variable that affects the slope of the Lineweaver-Burke plots shown in Fig. 2.Table II.Apparent kinetic constants and dissociation constants (Kd) for the reaction of LCAT with rHDL and proteoliposomes containing sphingomyelinSubstratesSPMKdaThe dissociation constants were determined by the activity inhibition method as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the molar concentrations of apoA-I (A-I) or PC in the calculations.

Open table in a new tab The proteoliposome substrates had increasing slopes for the highest SPM contents (Fig. 2A) consistent with increasing Kd. However, the appVmax values decreased with added SPM, suggesting competition of SPM for PC at the active site. These results are in complete agreement with those reported by Subbaiah and Liu (13Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20156-20163Google Scholar). The apparent kinetic constants are summarized in Table II. In the absence of the SPM inhibitor, the appVmax is 37% higher for an rHDL than for a proteoliposome substrate, and the appKm (in terms of PC concentration) is 4.4-fold lower for rHDL, giving an overall 5.2-fold greater catalytic efficiency (appVmax/appKm) for the rHDL substrates. This is the first quantitative comparison of these two widely used synthetic substrates for LCAT. To confirm that SPM increases the Kd for the interaction of rHDL and proteoliposomes with LCAT, we measured directly the LCAT binding affinity of a series of rHDL and proteoliposome particles without 14C-cholesterol using the activity inhibition assay previously described (18Bolin D.J. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7429-7434Google Scholar). We found that the Kd for rHDL increased about 5-fold in a linear manner with increasing SPM, and the Kd for proteoliposomes increased 2-fold (see Table II). Clearly, the presence of SPM in the particles decreases LCAT affinity for the phospholipid interface. To determine if the effect of S"

INTRODUCTIONLysosomes contain more than 50 hydrolytic enzymes which act in concert to degrade a wide range of macromolecules. The N-linked oligosaccharides of many newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are modified to contain mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P). 1The abbreviations used are: Man-6-Pmannose 6-phosphateMPRMan-6-P receptorsCI-MPRsoluble cation independent MPRPPTprotein palmitoyl thioesteraseINCLinfantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosisAMCamino-4-methylcoumarine4-MU4-methylumbelliferylPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyHBhomogenization buffer. This moiety is specifically recognized by Man-6-P receptors (MPRs) which direct the vesicular transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome (reviewed in Refs. 1Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Google Scholar, 2Hoflack B. Lobel P. Tartakoff A.M. Storrie B. Murphy R.F. Advances in Cell and Molecular Biology of Membranes. Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1993: 51-80Google Scholar, 3Gabel C.A. Loh Y.P. Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 103Google Scholar).In most cultured cells, Man-6-P is a transient targeting signal, being rapidly removed when newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes reach the lysosome (4Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 81-94Google Scholar). This is not, however, always the case. In CI-MPR-deficient mouse cell lines, acid hydrolases that reach the lysosome retain the Man-6-P marker (3Gabel C.A. Loh Y.P. Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 103Google Scholar, 5Gabel C.A. Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 775-779Google Scholar). Furthermore, dephosphorylation of Man-6-P glycoproteins in a mouse L cell line which contains the CI-MPR varies under different in vitro culture conditions (4Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 81-94Google Scholar, 6Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1037-1046Google Scholar). These cells dephosphorylate normally when grown at low density, but accumulate Man-6-P glycoproteins when grown at high density or in the absence of serum. In addition, Man-6-P glycoproteins endocytosed by these cell lines in the absence of serum were restricted to a subset of lysosomes. It has been suggested (3Gabel C.A. Loh Y.P. Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 103Google Scholar) that there are actually two distinct lysosomal populations which are differentiated by the presence or absence of Man-6-phosphatase activity and that these may have specialized functions.It is possible that such a Man-6-phosphatase-deficient compartment could actually represent a functionally specialized lysosome with a characteristic complement of lysosomal enzymes and a restricted cellular distribution. In this report, we have investigated this possibility by surveying the steady state levels of Man-6-P glycoproteins in different rat tissues and found increased levels in rat brain. This accumulation reflects a higher proportion of lysosomal enzymes containing Man-6-P, which is compatible with targeting of phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes to a Man-6-phosphatase-deficient compartment in brain. We have also identified the major Man-6-P glycoproteins in brain, finding a number of known lysosomal enzymes and one protein not previously known to be Man-6-phosphorylated.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that rat brain contains considerably higher levels of Man-6-P glycoproteins than other tissues and organs. One possible explanation for this observation is that synthesis of lysosomal enzymes is higher in brain than in other tissues, resulting in detection of more Man-6-P glycoproteins in transit to the lysosome. In this report, however, we demonstrate that, while brain contains lower levels of lysosomal enzymes than most other tissues, it has a much higher proportion containing Man-6-P.Assuming that lysosomal enzymes are initially phosphorylated to similar extents in different tissues, changes in the proportion of lysosomal enzymes that contain Man-6-P are most likely to result from decreased dephosphorylation, which could reflect either decreased Man-6-phosphatase activity or targeting to a specialized phosphatase-deficient compartment. Support for the latter possibility comes from histochemical studies. Man-6-P glycoproteins are prominent in the cell bodies of multiple neurons throughout the nervous system (44O'Brien D.A. Magyar P.L. Sleat D.E. Lobel P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 221Google Scholar), but do not colocalize with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, a marker of “classical” lysosomes and late endosomes. The nature of this compartment and the function for the retention of the Man-6-P marker remain to be determined. However, it may be significant that brain expresses less CI-MPR than other tissues (45Ballesteros M. Scott C.D. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 775-779Google Scholar, 46Sklar M.M. Kiess W. Thomas C.L. Nissley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16733-16738Google Scholar).One important result of this study is the finding that not only is PPT Man-6-phosphorylated in brain but that it is one of the most abundant Man-6-P glycoproteins. PPT is a 37-kDa glycoprotein which cleaves palmitoyl-CoA and removes covalently attached palmitate (and other fatty acid) moieties from proteins (30Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Google Scholar, 31Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Google Scholar). It is clear from Fig. 1 that brain contains the highest levels of Man-6-phosphorylated PPT. While bands approximating in size to the Man-6-phosphorylated PPT in brain are also seen in kidney, lung, and heart (Fig. 1), their identity remains equivocal, and they are comparatively minor. Although brain contains the highest levels of Man-6-phosphorylated PPT, it does not contain the highest PPT activity. Using 3H-labeled, palmitoylated H-Ras as a substrate, PPT activity has been demonstrated to be higher in testis, seminal vesicle, and spleen than brain (30Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Google Scholar).The presence of Man-6-P residues on PPT strongly suggests that this protein is lysosomal. However, although the intracellular distribution of PPT has not yet been rigorously defined, it has been tentatively assigned a nonlysosomal, possibly extracellular, localization. This conclusion was based on: 1) overexpression studies in COS cells where most of the PPT was secreted into the media and 2) the observation that PPT has a neutral pH optimum. These do not necessarily preclude a lysosomal localization. First, expression studies in vitro may not necessarily reflect distribution in vivo. For example, known lysosomal enzymes, such as cathepsin D, are secreted when overexpressed in cell lines (47Garcia M. Derocq D. Pujol P. Rochefort H. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1809-1814Google Scholar). Moreover, the perinuclear and punctate cytoplasmic staining of intracellular PPT in transfected COS cells (48Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Google Scholar) is not incompatible with a lysosomal localization. Second, some established lysosomal enzymes such as sialic acid specific 9-O-acetylesterase and glycosyl-N-asparaginase have neutral pH optima (49Butor C. Griffiths G. Aronson N.N. Varki A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2213-2219Google Scholar).There are some nonlysosomal enzymes which are reported to contain significant amounts of Man-6-P, e.g. renin (50Faust P.L. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1947-1955Google Scholar), transforming growth factor β1 precursor (51Purchio A.F. Cooper J.A. Brunner A.M. Lioubin M.N. Gentry L.E. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. Marquardt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14211-14215Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor receptor (52Todderud G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17893-17896Google Scholar), proliferin (53Lee S.-J. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3521-3527Google Scholar), thyroglobulin (54Herzog V. Neumuller W. Holzmann B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 555-560Google Scholar), and herpes simplex glycoprotein D (55Brunetti C.R. Burke R.L. Kornfeld S. Gregory W. Masiarz F.R. Dingwell K.S. Johnson D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17067-17074Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the Man-6-phosphorylated forms of these proteins remains questionable as they have only been detected when overexpressed in cell culture. Should PPT eventually prove to be a nonlysosomal Man-6-P glycoprotein, then it will be the first to be directly observed in vivo. However, it is clear that PPT contains the Man-6-P lysosomal targeting signal and thus most likely represents an authentic lysosomal enzyme.In a recent study, mutations inactivating PPT have been shown to result in infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) (48Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Google Scholar), which is a progressive and fatal degenerative encephalopathy. The later stages of INCL are characterized by the appearance of storage bodies containing lipofuscin in the brain and other organs. Lipofuscin is an autofluorescent cellular pigment that represents an accumulation of insoluble polymeric matter within the lysosomes. This material is complex and contains protein and oxidized lipid components. A lysosomal role for PPT actually provides a molecular explanation for INCL. Defects in PPT could lead to accumulation of its lipoprotein substrates within the lysosome, impairing cellular function and resulting in neurodegeneration. INCL may actually therefore represent a classical lysosomal storage disorder. INTRODUCTIONLysosomes contain more than 50 hydrolytic enzymes which act in concert to degrade a wide range of macromolecules. The N-linked oligosaccharides of many newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are modified to contain mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P). 1The abbreviations used are: Man-6-Pmannose 6-phosphateMPRMan-6-P receptorsCI-MPRsoluble cation independent MPRPPTprotein palmitoyl thioesteraseINCLinfantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosisAMCamino-4-methylcoumarine4-MU4-methylumbelliferylPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyHBhomogenization buffer. This moiety is specifically recognized by Man-6-P receptors (MPRs) which direct the vesicular transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome (reviewed in Refs. 1Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Google Scholar, 2Hoflack B. Lobel P. Tartakoff A.M. Storrie B. Murphy R.F. Advances in Cell and Molecular Biology of Membranes.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 103Google Scholar).In most cultured cells, Man-6-P is a transient targeting signal, being rapidly removed when newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes reach the lysosome (4Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 81-94Google Scholar). This is not, however, always the case. In CI-MPR-deficient mouse cell lines, acid hydrolases that reach the lysosome retain the Man-6-P marker (3Gabel C.A. Loh Y.P. Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 103Google Scholar, 5Gabel C.A. Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 775-779Google Scholar). Furthermore, dephosphorylation of Man-6-P glycoproteins in a mouse L cell line which contains the CI-MPR varies under different in vitro culture conditions (4Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 81-94Google Scholar, 6Einstein R. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1037-1046Google Scholar). These cells dephosphorylate normally when grown at low density, but accumulate Man-6-P glycoproteins when grown at high density or in the absence of serum. In addition, Man-6-P glycoproteins endocytosed by these cell lines in the absence of serum were restricted to a subset of lysosomes. It has been suggested (3Gabel C.A. Loh Y.P. Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 103Google Scholar) that there are actually two distinct lysosomal populations which are differentiated by the presence or absence of Man-6-phosphatase activity and that these may have specialized functions.It is possible that such a Man-6-phosphatase-deficient compartment could actually represent a functionally specialized lysosome with a characteristic complement of lysosomal enzymes and a restricted cellular distribution. In this report, we have investigated this possibility by surveying the steady state levels of Man-6-P glycoproteins in different rat tissues and found increased levels in rat brain. This accumulation reflects a higher proportion of lysosomal enzymes containing Man-6-P, which is compatible with targeting of phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes to a Man-6-phosphatase-deficient compartment in brain. We have also identified the major Man-6-P glycoproteins in brain, finding a number of known lysosomal enzymes and one protein not previously known to be Man-6-phosphorylated."

PGHS-1 is considered a basal enzyme; PGHS-2 is associated with inflammation and cell proliferation. A number of highly selective inhibitors for PGHS-2 cyclooxygenase activity are known. Inhibition by these agents involves an initial reversible binding, followed by a time-dependent transition to a much higher affinity enzyme-inhibitor complex, making these agents potent and poorly reversible PGHS-2 inhibitors. To investigate the PGHS-2 structural features that influence the time-dependent action of the selective inhibitors, we have constructed a three-dimensional model of human PGHS-2 by homologous modeling. Examination of the PGHS-2 model identified Val509 as a cyclooxygenase active site residue, that was not conserved in PGHS-1. Recombinant human PGHS-2 with Val509 mutated to either Ile (the corresponding residue in PGHS-1), Ala, Glu, or Lys was expressed by transient transfection of COS-1 cells to evaluate the effects of the mutations on cyclooxygenase activity and on inhibition by four agents reported to be selective for PGHS-2 (NS398, nimesulide, DuP697, and SC58125). All the recombinant proteins were of the expected mass. The mutants exhibited 45-210% of wild-type cyclooxygenase activity, with Km values for arachidonate of 2.1-7.6 µM (wild-type PGHS-2, 3.8 µM), indicating that changes in position 509 had modest effects on cyclooxygenase catalysis. Each of the agents inhibited wild-type PGHS-2 in a time-dependent fashion, and all but nimesulide did the same for the V509A mutant. In contrast, the V509E and V509I PGHS-2 mutants, like recombinant human PGHS-1, did not show time-dependent inhibition with any of the agents, and the V509K mutant responded in a time-dependent manner only to DuP697. Reversible inhibition was still observed with Val509 mutants that did not show time-dependent inhibition. Thus, the side chain structure at position 509 markedly influenced the ability of PGHS-2 to undergo the time-dependent transition without removing inhibitor or substrate binding. These results indicate that Val509 in PGHS-2 has a major role in the structural transition that underlies time-dependent inhibition by the isoform-selective agents.

Goldyne M. Granstrom E. Hamberg M. Hammarstrom S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 997-1029Google Scholar). Two isoforms of PGHS are known, with PGHS-1 generally ascribed housekeeping roles, whereas the strong induction of PGHS-2 by cytokines is believed to be a key part in inflammatory processes (2Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Google Scholar). Many cyclooxygenase inhibitors have been discovered; the most potent include agents, such as indomethacin, which trigger a time-dependent change in the protein once bound in the cyclooxygenase active site, thus achieving essentially irreversible inhibition without covalent modification of protein or agent (3Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar, 4Stanford N. Roth G.J. Shen T.Y. Majerus P.W. Prostaglandins. 1977; 13: 669-675Google Scholar, 5Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12572-12578Google Scholar). More recently, a set of time-dependent cyclooxygenase inhibitors with very high selectivity for PGHS-2 has been identified (6Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B.

Little is known about the nature of the structural change(s) underlying noncovalent time-dependent cyclooxygenase inhibition of either isoform or about the protein structural features that lead to the remarkable specificity of the PGHS-2 inhibitors. prostaglandin H synthase polymerase chain reaction. We have constructed a three-dimensional model for human PGHS-2 based on the crystal structure of ovine PGHS-1 (9Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar) and identified Val509 in PGHS-2 as one of the few residues in the cyclooxygenase active site that is not conserved in PGHS-1. Recombinant human PGHS-2 was expressed with four Val509 mutations to assess their effects on cyclooxygenase activity and on inhibition by agents specific for PGHS-2. Several of the Val509 mutations led to a loss of the characteristic time-dependent action of the agents without a large perturbation of substrate or inhibitor binding. The results point to a role for Val509 in the time-dependent structural transition, which makes these agents such potent and selective inhibitors of human PGHS-2 cyclooxygenase activity. Heme, dimethyl sulfoxide, and D-tryptophan were from Sigma; Tween 20 was from Pierce; arachidonate was from NuChek Preps, Inc.; and [1-14C]arachidonate (55 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Nimesulide was from Cayman Chemical Co. DuP697, SC58125, and NS398 were generous gifts from Drs. Chakk Ramesha (Roche Pharmaceuticals) and Paul J. Marshall (CIBA Pharmaceuticals). The structural model for human PGHS-2 was built from the crystallographic coordinates for ovine PGHS-1 (9Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar) using the Quanta 3.3 protein-modeling package (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) and an approach similar to that described for thromboxane synthase (10Ruan K.-H. Milfeld K. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1345-1351Google Scholar). Briefly, the PGHS-2 sequence was aligned with that of PGHS-1, and the main chain conformation of PGHS-2 was set with the coordinates of the aligned PGHS-1 main chain. The PGHS-2 amino acid side chains were then added to the main chain model, with the side chain conformations set at the most common dihedral angle. An energy minimization routine was then used to adjust the model to remove steric conflicts and produce reasonable peptide folding. Construction of a pSG5 plasmid containing the cDNA for human PGHS-1 was described previously (11Ren Y. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 751-757Google Scholar). A pcDNAI/neo expression vector containing the human PGHS-2 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Timothy Hla (American Red Cross). The 3.1-kilobase EcoRI fragment including the PGHS-2 coding region was isolated from the plasmid and ligated into the parent pSG5 vector (Stratagene). Double digestion with BamHI and XhoI was used to verify the correct orientation and to remove extraneous DNA originating from the original pcDNAI/neo vector. The ends of the resulting 6.0-kilobase fragment were filled with Klenow enzyme and circularized with T4 DNA ligase. The final pSG5 construct containing the whole human PGHS-2 cDNA, termed pCoxII, was checked by several restriction digests, by DNA sequencing, and for expression of cyclooxygenase activity in transfected COS-1 cells. The pCoxII plasmid served as the starting point for mutagenesis of Val509. The basic strategy (12Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Google Scholar) was as follows. Specific mutated primer pairs were designed for each Val509 mutation. Besides introducing the desired amino acid mutation, each specific pair changed the status of a NcoI site from that in the previous plasmid, allowing rapid verification of successful mutation. General upstream and downstream primers were designed to encompass the PstI restriction site upstream (1420 base pairs from the ATG) and the XhoI site downstream (1881 base pairs from the ATG) of the mutated region in the PCR products. To construct a particular mutant, the specific mutated primers were first amplified by PCR (13Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Google Scholar) with the corresponding upstream or downstream general primers, using pCoxII as the template. The products from this first round of PCR were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then combined for a second round of PCR with only the upstream and downstream primers. The second PCR product was then digested with PstI and XhoI to generate a 461-base pair fragment containing the mutated Val509 codon. This mutated fragment was then inserted into the starting plasmid, which had been digested with the same restriction enzymes to remove the corresponding fragment containing the initial sequence. After ligation, the altered plasmid was transformed into XL1-Blue cells. Mutant colonies were selected, and the mutation was confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. The upstream primer was 5′-CGCTTTATGCTGAAGCCC-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-GGTGACACTATAGAATAGGG-3′. The specific primers were (with mutated codons in bold and the removed and restored NcoI site underlined): V509I (NcoI site removed, pCoxII used as cloning vector), forward, 5′-GAAATAGAAGTTGG 3′; reverse, 5′-CTTCTATTTCACC-3′; V509K (NcoI site removed, pCoxII used as cloning vector), forward, 5′-GAAAAAGAAGTTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTTCTTTTTCACC-3′; V509A (NcoI site restored, V509I plasmid used as cloning vector), forward, 5′-GAAACAGAAGTTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTTCTGTTTCACC-3′; and V509E (NcoI site restored, V509I plasmid used as cloning vector), forward, 5′-GAAAAAGAAGTTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTTCTTTTTCACC-3′. Transfection of COS-1 cells used a modification of the procedure described previously (11Ren Y. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 751-757Google Scholar). Each 100-mm dish of cells received 1.6 mg of DEAE-dextran and 15 µg of plasmid DNA in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; 450 µg of chloroquine was added 1 h later in 7 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested 60 h after transfection and disrupted by sonication, and a membrane fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman Instruments 50Ti rotor. The membranes were resuspended in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5, and Tween 20 (10%) was added dropwise to give a final concentration of 1%. After 30 min of gentle shaking on ice, the residual membrane material was pelleted by centrifugation as before, and the supernatant containing solubilized enzyme was removed and stored on ice until use. Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry method, which included a trichloroacetic acid precipitation step (14Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (11Ren Y. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 751-757Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase activity was assayed with an oxygen electrode essentially as described previously for PGHS-1 (15Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C. McDonald-Gibson R.G. Nigam S. Slater T.F. Prostaglandins and Related Substances: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 209Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 µM arachidonate, 5 µM heme, and 5 mMD-tryptophan. This level of tryptophan was found to give maximal stimulation of the cyclooxygenase velocity of PGHS-2. One unit of cyclooxygenase activity resulted in a maximal rate of oxygen consumption of 1 nmol of O2/min. For determination of affinity for fatty acid substrate, fixed amounts of the solubilized recombinant enzyme were assayed in the standard reaction mixture containing 1-100 µM arachidonate. The arachidonate stock solutions were standardized by measurement of total oxygen consumption when aliquots were reacted with excess ovine PGHS-1, assuming 2 mol of O2/mol fatty acid. Velocity data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using a nonlinear least squares routine (Kaleidagraph software) to estimate the Km values. The arachidonate metabolite profile was examined by incubating aliquots of the detergent-solubilized recombinant enzymes with [14C]arachidonate (20 µM) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 µM heme, and 5 mMD-tryptophan at room temperature for 2 min. Reactions were stopped by extraction with ice-cold diethyl ether-methanol-1 M citric acid (30:4:1). After drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the lipid products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography at 0°C on Whatman LK6D silica gel plates with diethyl ether-heptane-acetic acid (85:15:0.1) as the solvent. The separated bands were visualized by autoradiography. To assess susceptibility of recombinant PGHS to time-dependent inhibition, detergent-solubilized enzyme from transfected COS-1 cell membranes (100-200 µg of protein; 20-40 units) was added to a reaction cuvette containing 3 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 5 mMD-tryptophan, and 10 µM heme. After incubation for 1 min to reconstitute the holoenzyme, inhibitor was added, and the incubation continued for the desired time before the surviving cyclooxygenase activity was assayed by injection of 100 µM arachidonate. Stock solutions of inhibitors were prepared in ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, or acetone; control incubations included the solvent without inhibitor. Time-dependent cyclooxygenase inhibition is characterized by increased inhibitory potency on prolonged preincubation with inhibitor (3Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar). Recombinant PGHS-2 was first tested at several levels of each inhibitor to establish a concentration at which time-dependent inhibition clearly was observed. The inhibitor was then used at levels up to 10-fold higher to examine its effects on the PGHS-2 mutants and PGHS-1. In this manner, time-dependent inhibition of the PGHS-2 mutants could be detected even if the affinity for the inhibitor was considerably lower than that for wild-type PGHS-2. A high resolution crystallographic structure for human PGHS-2 is not yet available. However, a three-dimensional structure has been determined for ovine PGHS-1 complexed with flurbiprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (9Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar). Human PGHS-2 shares about 60% overall amino acid identity with human and ovine PGHS-1 and much higher conservation in residues identified as being required for activity in PGHS-1 (16Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Google Scholar). The two purified isoforms have comparable cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities (6Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C. Freire J. Chan H. Sigal E. Ramesha Chakk Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Google Scholar, 17Percival M.D. Ouellet M. Vincent C.J. Yergey J.A. Kennedy B.P. O'Neill G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 111-118Google Scholar, 18Johnson J.L. Wimsatt J. Buckel S.D. Dyer R.D. Maddipati K.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 26-34Google Scholar). This high level of sequence conservation and functional similarity indicates that the positions of the main chain atoms in PGHS-2 are likely to be relatively close to those in PGHS-1 (19Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Google Scholar). Also, flurbiprofen has comparable inhibitory potency toward the two human PGHS isoforms (20Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar). Thus, the PGHS-1 crystal structure is a reasonable template for construction of a structural model of human PGHS-2 using the homologous modeling approach (10Ruan K.-H. Milfeld K. Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1345-1351Google Scholar). The ovine PGHS-1 and human PGHS-2 sequences align very well, with disjunctions only at the amino and carboxyl termini (21Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 163Google Scholar). These mismatched segments were not resolved in the PGHS-1 crystal structure (9Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar), so there were no gaps to be bridged when the PGHS-2 main chain was superimposed on that of PGHS-1 in the modeling process. The cyclooxygenase active site regions of the resulting PGHS-2 structural model, as well as the PGHS-1 template, are shown in Fig. 1. Twelve residues were found within 4.5 angstroms of flurbiprofen bound in the PGHS-1 cyclooxygenase active site: Val116, Arg120, Val349, Leu352, Ser353, Tyr355, Tyr385, Ile523, Gly526, Ala527, Ser530, and Leu531. It was remarkable that all but one of these residues in the immediate vicinity of the inhibitor are conserved in PGHS-2 and are predicted to adopt comparable positions (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the roughly similar action of flurbiprofen on the two PGHS isoforms (20Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar). The one major difference in the two active site models is Val509 of PGHS-2, which corresponds to Ile523 in PGHS-1 (Fig. 1). This residue sits on the opposite wall of the cyclooxygenase channel from Ser516 (Ser530 in PGHS-1), the residue acetylated by aspirin (22Roth G.J. Machuga E.T. Ozols J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4672-4675Google Scholar, 23Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Google Scholar, 24Wennogle L.P. Liang H. Quintavalla J.C. Bowen B.R. Wasvary J. Miller D.B. Allentoff A. Boyer W. Kelly M. Marshall P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 315-320Google Scholar). The shorter side chain of Val509 in PGHS-2 provides a potential basis for discrimination between the isoforms in interactions with selective inhibitors such as NS398 (25Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Google Scholar) and identified Val509 as a mutagenic target. Accordingly, recombinant human PGHS-2 proteins with isoleucine, alanine, glutamate, or lysine at position 509 were expressed by transient transfection of COS-1 cells, and the properties of the mutant proteins compared with those of wild-type human PGHS-2 and PGHS-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoblot analysis of the recombinant PGHS-2 proteins (Fig. 2) revealed major bands with Mr values of about 75,000, demonstrating that each of the mutants had the mass expected for the full length monomer (16Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Google Scholar). Analysis of COS-1 cells expressing recombinant human PGHS-1 with antibody raised against ovine PGHS-1 also detected a single major band near Mr 75,000 (data not shown). The V509I and V509E mutants were expressed at somewhat higher levels, and the V509A and V509K mutants at somewhat lower levels, than PGHS-2 itself (Fig. 2). Each of the PGHS-2 mutants was found to have considerable cyclooxygenase activity (Table I). The specific activities were highest for the V509I and V509E mutants and lowest for the V509K and V509A mutants. The similar relative ranking of protein expression (Fig. 2) and specific activity (Table I) indicates that the mutations at position 509 did not grossly alter the cyclooxygenase catalytic competence of PGHS-2. The metabolite profiles of the recombinant enzymes were analyzed using [14C]arachidonate, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild-type PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 and the PGHS-2 Val509 mutants each displayed comparable metabolite patterns (data not shown), much like that observed with purified recombinant PGHS-2 (26Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24019-24023Google Scholar). This indicates that the Val509 mutations did not result in marked changes of product specificity.Table I.Cyclooxygenase activities in transfected cell extractsPlasmidCyclooxygenase specific activityaData are from the same transfected cells analyzed for the experiment in Fig. 2.KmbAverage from two separate batches of transfected cells.units/mgµM arachidonateHuman PGHS-21213.8V509A914.0V509E2562.1V509I2242.9V509K547.6Human PGHS-11282.5a Data are from the same transfected cells analyzed for the experiment in Fig. 2.b Average from two separate batches of transfected cells. Open table in a new tab The Km values of the mutants for arachidonate were measured to probe for changes in substrate binding (Table I). The Km value for recombinant human PGHS-1 was 2.5 µM (Table I), similar to reported values of 4.5-5.6 µM (6Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C.

The Km value was little changed in the V509A, V509E, and V509I mutants. Only with the positively charged V509K mutation, with a Km value near 8 µM, was there any indication of altered fatty acid binding. Thus, residue 509 in PGHS-2 does not appear to be a major determinant of cyclooxygenase substrate binding. It may be that the predicted proximity of Val509 to the position of bound flurbiprofen in the crystal structure does not accurately reflect its relationship to bound arachidonate in the native enzyme. The effects of the mutations of Val509 on inhibitor interactions were examined with NS398, nimesulide, DuP697, and SC58125 (see Fig. 3 for structures), agents expected to be selective time-dependent inhibitors of PGHS-2 (6Barnett J.

A. 1994; 91: 12013-12017Google Scholar); the results with NS398 are shown in Fig. 4. With wild-type PGHS-2, the cyclooxygenase inhibition was proportional to the NS398 concentration and the length of the preincubation period (Fig. 4A). This is the expected behavior of an inhibitor that first binds the cyclooxygenase rapidly and reversibly, with the enzyme-inhibitor complex then undergoing some slower transition to form a tighter complex (3Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar, 28Callan O.H. So O.-Y. Swinney D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3548-3554Google Scholar). This progression from a weaker (EI) to a tighter (EI′) complex is indicated in Equation 1, with the initial, readily reversible binding governed by Keq1, and the poorly reversible transition to the tighter complex governed by Keq2. E+I⇔Keq1EI⇔Keq2EI′(Eq. 1) Fig. 4Effects of preincubation time and NS398 concentration on cyclooxygenase activity in recombinant PGHS-2, Val509 mutants, and PGHS-1. Solubilized enzyme preparations were preincubated for the indicated times with fixed levels of NS398 before the cyclooxygenase activity remaining was assayed by addition of 100 µM arachidonate. Activities were normalized to control values after a 60-s preincubation. Details are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inhibitory pattern for the V509A mutant and NS398 was similar to that seen for wild-type PGHS-2 (Fig. 4, Aand B), indicating that this PGHS-2 mutant also was susceptible to time-dependent inhibition by NS398. In contrast, cyclooxygenase inhibition in the V509E, V509I, and V509K PGHS-2 mutants and in PGHS-1 was independent of the length of preincubation, even at NS398 levels 10-fold higher than that producing time-dependent inhibition in PGHS-2 (Fig. 4). Inhibition of the V509E, V509I, and V509K mutants did increase with the NS398 concentration (Fig. 4, C-E), confirming that NS398 was able to reversibly inhibit these PGHS-2 mutants. Thus, the time-dependent action of NS398 was blocked in these mutants, although the agent was still able to bind. The three other isoform-specific agents were also characterized for their inhibitory effects on the recombinant enzymes, using the approach described for NS398; the results are summarized in Table II. With recombinant PGHS-2, preincubation with nimesulide, DuP697, or SC58125 produced a progressive inhibition of the cyclooxygenase, following the pattern seen with NS398 in Fig. 4. Thus, all four agents can be classed as time-dependent inhibitors for wild-type PGHS-2 (Table II). For recombinant PGHS-1, on the other hand, preincubation did not increase the potency of any of the agents, even at levels at least 6-fold higher than those that showed progressive inhibition of PGHS-2. The present results thus confirm previous reports characterizing these agents as selective time-dependent inhibitors for PGHS-2 (6Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C. Freire J. Chan H. Sigal E. Ramesha Chakk Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Google Scholar, 7Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D.

The Val509 mutations in PGHS-2 produced varied responses to the inhibitors (Table II). The V509A mutant was susceptible to time-dependent inhibition by all of the agents tested except nimesulide, whereas only DuP697 produced time-dependent inhibition in the V509K mutant, and none of the agents produced time-dependent inhibition in the V509E and V509I mutants. The V509I and V509E mutations thus induced a qualitative response to these inhibitors most like that seen with PGHS-1, whereas the V509A mutant behaved much like PGHS-2. The differences between the behavior of wild-type PGHS-2 and the V509I mutant demonstrate that even subtle changes at position 509 influenced the susceptibility to time-dependent inhibition. The small number of mutants tested make generalizations difficult, but increases in bulk or charge (Val → Ile, Glu, or Lys) decreased the tendency to time-dependent inhibition, whereas a decrease in bulk (Val → Ala) had little effect.Table IIInhibitory characteristics of PGHS-2-specific agents with recombinant enzymesAgentNS398NimesulideDuP697SC58125PGHS-2TD, 2 µMTD, 1 µMTD, 0.5 µMTD, 3 µMV509ATD, 3 µMNTD, 25 µM (57% inhibition)TD, 0.1 µMTD, 0.05 µMV509ENTD, 40 µM (18% inhibition)NTD, 25 µM (25% inhibition)NTD, 15 µM (47% inhibition)NTD, 20 µM (3% inhibition)V509INTD, 20 µM (28% inhibition)NTD, 25 µM (24% inhibition)NTD, 5 µM (43% inhibition)NTD, 20 µM (7% inhibition)V509KNTD, 40 µM (24% inhibition)NTD, 25 µM (32% inhibition)TD, 2 µMNTD, 20 µM (33% inhibition)PGHS-1NTD, 20 µM (8% inhibition)NTD, 25 µM (1% inhibition)NTD, 10 µM (25% inhibition)NTD, 20 µM (1% inhibition) Open table in a new tab It is important to note that each of the Val509 mutants was obviously inhibited by the selective agents, even in the absence of a time-dependent effect (Fig. 4 and Table II). For example, the cyclooxygenase activity of the Val509 mutants was decreased by 24-57% at 25 µM nimesulide. This behavior is characteristic of reversible inhibition (3Rome L.H. Lands W.E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4863-4865Google Scholar) and confirms the competence of the mutants for initial binding of the agents in the cyclooxygenase active site (governed by Keq1 in Equation 1). Precise evaluation of Ki values was not practical because of the relatively low control activity levels and the complex nature of the enzyme preparations. However, rough estimates of reversible inhibition can be obtained for time-dependent inhibitors by extrapolating the surviving cyclooxygenase activity data (as for NS398 in Fig. 4, A and B) back to zero time. These values can be compared with the level of reversible inhibition seen for other mutants with the same concentration of agent. In this manner, reversible inhibition by 5 µM NS398 can be estimated from the data in Fig. 4 to be about 35% for PGHS-2, 30% for V509A, 10% for V509E, V509I, and V509K, and less than 2% for PGHS-1. Considering that the inhibitor is competing with 100 µM substrate for reversible binding, the observed levels of inhibition indicate that the Val509 mutants retain a strong affinity for inhibitor, certainly much more than with PGHS-1. The modest effects of the Val509 mutations on inhibitor binding are quite consistent with those on substrate binding (Table I). The absence of time-dependent action in several of the Val509 mutants despite inhibitor binding competence (Fig. 4 and Table II) indicates that the inhibitor-enzyme complex does not undergo the further transition to the tighter complex (governed by Keq2 in Equation 1). Val509 thus seems to have a major role, not in the initial inhibitor binding, but rather in the subsequent structural transformation. The nature of the structural transformation induced by noncovalent time-dependent agents (EI → EI′ in Equation 1) is not known for either isoform. In PGHS-1, bound inhibitor blocks proteolytic attack near Arg277, in a distant part of the protein (9Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Google Scholar, 29Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14136-14144Google Scholar). This long-range effect is not easily rationalized from the crystal structure of inhibited PGHS-1. Inhibitor binding also stabilizes PGHS-1 to extremes of temperature and pH (30Mizuno K. Yamamoto S. Lands W.E.M. Prostaglandins. 1982; 23: 743-757Google Scholar). These observations suggest that local conformational changes in the cyclooxygenase active site can trigger a general increase in rigidity of the protein. In this interpretation, a particular combination of inhibitor structure and accessible protein motion in the cyclooxygenase site would give rise to the time-dependent transition of the inhibitor-enzyme complex. Mutation of Arg120, the putative carboxyl group ligand in the PGHS-1 cyclooxygenase site, does diminish susceptibility to the time-dependent action of acidic inhibitors (31Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Falgueyret J.-P. Vickers P.J. O'Neill G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29372-29377Google Scholar, 32Bhattacharyya D.K. Lecomte M. Rieke C.J. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2179-2184Google Scholar). However, the Arg120 mutant had a Km value for fatty acid, at least 100-fold higher than that of wild-type PGHS-1, so the decreased time-dependent inhibition in the mutants is probably due to a very large drop in affinity for the acidic inhibitors. This situation contrasts with the Val509 mutants of PGHS-2, which retained considerable affinity for the inhibitors (Table II). The present results with the Val509 mutants of PGHS-2 are thus the first to identify, in either isoform, a protein structural feature involved in the transition from an initial enzyme-inhibitor complex to a very high affinity complex. This represents an important step toward characterizing the structural transition in the enzyme-inhibitor complex, which is the hallmark of the time-dependent agents and makes them such potent and pharmacologically useful cyclooxygenase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2132095774,"We previously described the purification of an 83-kDa phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) from the porcine thymus membranes (Kanoh, H., Imai, S.-i., Yamada, K. and Sakane, F. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25309-25314). However, we found that a minor 35-kDa protein could account for the PAP activity when the purified enzyme preparation was further analyzed. We thus determined the N-terminal sequence of the 35-kDa candidate protein and prepared antipeptide antibody against the determined sequence, MFDKTRLPYVALDVL. The antibody almost completely precipitated the purified enzyme activity. Furthermore, the antibody precipitated from the radioiodinated enzyme preparation a single 35-kDa protein, which was converted to a 29-kDa form when treated with N-glycanase. We also found that the immunoprecipitable PAP activity was exclusively associated with the plasma membranes of porcine thymocytes. These results indicated that the 35-kDa glycosylated protein represents the plasma membrane-bound (type 2) PAP. We surprisingly noted that the N-terminal sequence of the porcine PAP was almost completely conserved in the internal sequence encoded by a mouse partial cDNA clone, hic53, reported as a H2O2-inducible gene (Egawa, K., Yoshiwara, M., Shibanuma, M., and Nose, K. (1995) FEBS Lett. 372, 74-77). We thus amplified from the mouse kidney RNA the hic53 clone by polymerase chain reaction, and obtained a cDNA encoding a novel protein of 283 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 31,894. Methionine reported as an internal residue was found to serve as an initiator, and the C-terminal 64 residues were lacking in hic53. The protein contains several putative membrane-spanning domains and two N-glycosylation sites. When transfected into 293 cells, the cDNA gave more than 10-fold increase of the membrane-bound PAP activity, which could be precipitated by the antipeptide antibody. In [35S]methionine-labeled cells, the translational product was confirmed to be a 35-kDa protein, which became 30 kDa in cells treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation. We thus succeeded first in identifying the porcine type 2 PAP and subsequently in determining the primary structure of a mouse homolog of the PAP."

https://openalex.org/W2157027333,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (INDO) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan. It is induced strongly in many cell lines following interferon-γ treatment. We report the cloning and characterization of the full-length human INDO promoter. This promoter is 1,245 base pairs long and includes two interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) separated by an approximately 1-kilobase sequence. The presence of these two ISREs is critical for maximum INDO promoter activity (50-fold induction). When the ISREs are present in two separate fragments cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector, the INDO promoter activity drops significantly (7-fold induction). 5′ end deletions of the wild type promoter sequence indicate that removal of the ISRE (ISRE1) at position −1126 reduces the induction level to approximately 25-fold. This activity does not change appreciably when the promoter is deleted down to position −241. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of ISRE1 also decreases the promoter activity in a similar way. When ISRE1 is kept intact, deletion of the second ISRE (ISRE2) at position −111 leads to only 11-fold induction of the promoter. A similar result is obtained when substitution mutations are introduced in ISRE2. Deletion of a 748-base pair sequence between the two ISREs only shows a slight decrease in the INDO promoter activity.

The enzyme is induced predominantly by IFN-γ (Taylor and Feng, 24Taylor M.W. Feng G. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2516-2522Google Scholar), although in human peripheral blood leukocytes both IFN-α and IFN-γ have been reported to induce the enzyme (Carlin et al., 5Carlin J.M. Borden E.C. Sondel P.M. Byrne G.I. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2414-2418Google Scholar). INDO plays an important role in the host response to intracellular protozoan infections (Pfefferkorn, 21Pfefferkorn E.R. Proc.

INDO activity is also down-regulated by the cytokine interleukin-4 (Musso et al., 18Musso T. Gusella G.L. Brooks A.A. Longo D.L. Varesio L. Blood. 1995; 35: 1408-1411Google Scholar).The INDO gene has been cloned and a 96-bp regulatory region identified (Caplen and Gupta, 4Caplen H.S. Gupta S.L. J. Biol.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar). This segment of the promoter contains an ISRE-like sequence, found in the regulatory region of most IFN-α-inducible genes. The 96-bp region also contains two copies of a 9-bp palindromic sequence similar to the GAS (IFN-γ activating site) sequence reported by others (Decker et al., 8Decker T. Lew D.J. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Eur. Mol. Biol. 1991; 10: 927-932Google Scholar; Shuai et al., 23Shuai K. Schlinder C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 259: 1808-1812Google Scholar). The GAS sequence binds the IFN-γ-regulated DNA-binding factor STAT 91. Chon et al. (6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar) have shown that this ISRE-like sequence is required for expression when the INDO promoter region is linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. These researchers (Chon et al., 6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar) concluded that both ISRE and one of the GAS-flanking sequences are necessary for this CAT expression. However, we have shown previously that INDO induction is not correlated with STAT 91 activation (Klein et al., 14Klein S.B. Yeivin A. Becker G. Taylor M.W. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 333-341Google Scholar). Ozes and Taylor (20Ozes O.N. Taylor M.W. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 25-32Google Scholar) have shown previously by electrophoretic gel shift analysis that IRF-1 binds to this sequence and is an essential factor in the regulation of INDO expression.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19871-19877Google Scholar), the second approximately 100 bases from ISRE2. Thus the INDO promoter contains two ISRE regions of opposite polarity. In this paper we report that both ISRE regions are required for full induction of the INDO gene following treatment with IFN-γ and that deletion or mutation in either one of the two ISREs substantially decreases inducibility.DISCUSSIONPrevious results have suggested that the INDO promoter is regulated by an ISRE-like element and GAS sequence found between positions −1126 and −1083 (Fig. 2) (Hassanain et al., 12Hassanain H.H. Chon S.Y. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5077-5084Google Scholar; Chon et al., 6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar). Chon et al. (6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar) have shown that when this element was linked to a thymidine kinase-CAT reporter gene there was a 9-fold induction of CAT expression following transfection of GM00637 cells. We find similar levels of CAT expression when ME180 cells are transfected with this construct. However when the 1,245-base pair promoter region including two ISREs is placed upstream of the CAT construct, inducible levels are as high as 50-fold. This fragment contains approximately 855 bp of the 1.4-kb sequence reported by Dai and Gupta (7Dai W. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19871-19877Google Scholar) and around 390 bp of downstream sequence including the transcriptional initiation site of Kadoya et al. (13Kadoya A. Tone S. Maeda H. Minatogawa Y. Kindo R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 530-536Google Scholar). The 855- and 390-bp fragments each contain an ISRE sequence. When cloned upstream of the CAT reporter vector, these fragments are induced poorly (about 7-fold) by IFN-γ. 5′ end deletions of the wild type promoter sequence indicate that removal of the first ISRE at position −1126 (ISRE1) leads to a 2-fold decrease in the promoter activity. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of ISRE1 also drops the promoter activity in a similar way (24-fold induction). This activity does not change appreciably when the promoter is deleted down to position −241 (130 bp away from the second ISRE). When ISRE1 is kept intact, deletion of a 161-bp fragment including the second ISRE at position −111 (ISRE2) shows only 11-fold induction of the promoter.Since the 1.4-kb fragment (Dai and Gupta, 7Dai W. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19871-19877Google Scholar) shares an 855-bp (5′ end) DNA sequence with the wild type promoter, it was interesting to determine if the remaining 390 bp (3′ end) of the promoter was sufficient to confer wild type activity. Transfection of the 390-bp fragment linked to the CAT reporter gene into ME180 cells alone shows only a 7-fold induction of the promoter. A similar induction (8-fold) is observed when the 855-bp fragment is transfected into ME180 cells. These results suggest that the cis-acting element(s) required for INDO promoter induction reside within or at the junction of the 855- and 390-bp fragments. 5′ end deletions of the wild type promoter were thus performed using exonuclease III. Since in all of these deletion mutants the ISRE2 sequence is still present, it is likely that ISRE2 and/or flanking sequences are responsible for the 20-28-fold induction observed. To determine the importance of ISRE2, a 161-bp sequence including ISRE2 was deleted from the promoter. Transfection with the resulting ΔISRE2 vector shows that the promoter is induced poorly (11-fold).The data from the deletion analyses suggest that ISRE1 and ISRE2 are two cis-acting elements critical for full INDO promoter induction. To confirm the importance of these elements, point mutations were introduced in either ISRE1 or ISRE2, and the effects of these mutations were analyzed. When T at positions −1124 and −1122 was changed to C and G, respectively, the resulting construct had a lower promoter induction (24-fold). This result is consistent with deleting ISRE1 and confirms the hypothesis that ISRE1 is indeed one of the INDO promoter cis-acting elements. In addition to deleting ISRE2, ΔISRE2 construct has also the X box (−114/−104) and Y box (−144/−135) removed. X and Y boxes are considered to be the essential components of the IFN-γ response region of major histocompatibility complex class II promoters (Benoist and Mathis, 2Benoist C. Mathis D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 681-715Google Scholar; Dorn et al., 9Dorn A. Durand B. Marfing C. Meur M.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6249-6253Google Scholar) and cannot be ruled out as part of INDO cis-acting elements. When point mutations were introduced in the ISRE2 sequence, the resulting construct showed only a 4-fold induction of the INDO promoter. These results indicate that the ISRE2 sequence, and probably not the X and Y boxes, is also required for induction of the INDO gene. Finally, deletion of a 748-bp EcoNI/PstI fragment between ISRE1 and ISRE2 shows that the distance between the two ISREs is not as important as the presence of these elements.In an attempt to analyze the transcriptional induction of the human INDO gene, its promoter has been subjected to deletions and point mutation analyses. The results from these experiments strongly suggest that the INDO regulatory sequence spans at least a 1,245-bp fragment including two critical ISRE sequences. We hypothesize that following IFN-γ treatment, some newly synthesized factors bind to ISRE1 and ISRE2. INDO induction requires de novo protein synthesis since it is not induced in the presence of cycloheximide (Caplen and Gupta, 4Caplen H.S. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 332-339Google Scholar). This implies that STAT 91 is not directly involved in INDO induction because it is constitutively made and is activated after phosphorylation. However, the IFN-γ-inducible IRF1 protein is synthesized de novo. IRF1 has recently been associated with the induction by IFN-γ of the mouse GBP (Briken et al., 3Briken V. Ruffner H. Schultz U. Schwarz A. Reis L.F. Strehlow I. Decker T. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 975-982Google Scholar). Mouse GBP contains two ISRE sequences in its promoter region. Removal of the ISRE (Briken et al., 3Briken V. Ruffner H. Schultz U. Schwarz A. Reis L.F. Strehlow I. Decker T. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 975-982Google Scholar; Nicolet and Paulnock, 19Nicolet C.M. Paulnock D.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 153-162Google Scholar) close to the transcription start site abolishes GBP induction. Cotransfection of the GBP promoter construct and IRF1 cDNA up-regulates GBP promoter activity (Briken et al., 3Briken V. Ruffner H. Schultz U. Schwarz A. Reis L.F. Strehlow I. Decker T. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 975-982Google Scholar). The INDO gene has also two ISRE elements in its regulatory sequence and is likely to be transcriptionally induced by IRF1. Indeed, Ozes and Taylor (20Ozes O.N. Taylor M.W. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 25-32Google Scholar) have shown by Northern blot analysis that overexpression of IRF1 can induce an INDO message in ME180 cells. Furthermore, gel mobility shift assay indicates that IRF1 binds to ISRE1 of the INDO promoter. We show in this paper that in HepG2 cells, in which INDO activity is not induced, a truncated IRF-1 is made, and Northern analysis indicates that IRF-1 mRNA does not accumulate after 4 h of treatment with IFN-γ, whereas in ME180 cells IRF-1 continues to accumulate up to 24-48 h after treatment. Together, these data argue for a role for IRF1 in INDO induction. We hypothesize that following IFN-γ treatment, some newly synthesized factors such as IRF1 (with possibly STAT 91 and/or other unknown factors) bind to ISRE1 and ISRE2. These transacting factors may come in contact through DNA looping at the complementary ISRE regions.

The enzyme is induced predominantly by IFN-γ (Taylor and Feng, 24Taylor M.W. Feng G. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2516-2522Google Scholar), although in human peripheral blood leukocytes both IFN-α and IFN-γ have been reported to induce the enzyme (Carlin et al., 5Carlin J.M. Borden E.C. Sondel P.M. Byrne G.I. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2414-2418Google Scholar). INDO plays an important role in the host response to intracellular protozoan infections (Pfefferkorn, 21Pfefferkorn E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 908-912Google Scholar; Thomas et al., 25Thomas S.M. Garrity L.F. Brandt C.R. Schobert C.S. Feng G.S. Taylor M.W. Carlin J.M. Byrne G.I. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5529-5534Google Scholar), and tryptophan starvation as a result of INDO induction is involved in IFN-γ-induced cell death and apoptosis 2Konan, K. V., and Taylor, M. W. (1996) J. Interferon Cytokine Res., in press. (Gupta et al., 11Gupta S.L. Carlin J.M. Pyati P. Dai W. Pfefferkorn E.R. Murphy Jr., M.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2277-2284Google Scholar). INDO activity is also down-regulated by the cytokine interleukin-4 (Musso et al., 18Musso T. Gusella G.L. Brooks A.A. Longo D.L. Varesio L. Blood. 1995; 35: 1408-1411Google Scholar).The INDO gene has been cloned and a 96-bp regulatory region identified (Caplen and Gupta, 4Caplen H.S. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 332-339Google Scholar; Dai and Gupta, 7Dai W. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19871-19877Google Scholar; Chon et al., 6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar). This segment of the promoter contains an ISRE-like sequence, found in the regulatory region of most IFN-α-inducible genes. The 96-bp region also contains two copies of a 9-bp palindromic sequence similar to the GAS (IFN-γ activating site) sequence reported by others (Decker et al., 8Decker T. Lew D.J. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Eur. Mol. Biol. 1991; 10: 927-932Google Scholar; Shuai et al., 23Shuai K. Schlinder C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 259: 1808-1812Google Scholar). The GAS sequence binds the IFN-γ-regulated DNA-binding factor STAT 91. Chon et al. (6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar) have shown that this ISRE-like sequence is required for expression when the INDO promoter region is linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. These researchers (Chon et al., 6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar) concluded that both ISRE and one of the GAS-flanking sequences are necessary for this CAT expression. However, we have shown previously that INDO induction is not correlated with STAT 91 activation (Klein et al., 14Klein S.B. Yeivin A. Becker G. Taylor M.W. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 333-341Google Scholar). Ozes and Taylor (20Ozes O.N. Taylor M.W. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 25-32Google Scholar) have shown previously by electrophoretic gel shift analysis that IRF-1 binds to this sequence and is an essential factor in the regulation of INDO expression. Kadoya et al. (13Kadoya A. Tone S. Maeda H. Minatogawa Y. Kindo R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 530-536Google Scholar) cloned another INDO fragment. S1 mapping using a primer complementary to INDO cDNA (Kadoya et al., 13Kadoya A. Tone S. Maeda H. Minatogawa Y. Kindo R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 530-536Google Scholar) indicated a major transcription initiation site 33 nucleotides upstream of a putative translation initiation site, a position consistent with the sizes of the INDO message (approximately 1.8 kb) and of the INDO protein (42 kDa). A second ISRE sequence was found 99 bp upstream of that transcription site. These two reports identify different transcription start sites, the first 442 nucleotides 3′ from ISRE1 (Dai and Gupta, 7Dai W. Gupta S.L. J. Biol.

DISCUSSIONPrevious results have suggested that the INDO promoter is regulated by an ISRE-like element and GAS sequence found between positions −1126 and −1083 (Fig. 2) (Hassanain et al., 12Hassanain H.H. Chon S.Y. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5077-5084Google Scholar; Chon et al., 6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar). Chon et al. (6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar) have shown that when this element was linked to a thymidine kinase-CAT reporter gene there was a 9-fold induction of CAT expression following transfection of GM00637 cells. We find similar levels of CAT expression when ME180 cells are transfected with this construct. However when the 1,245-base pair promoter region including two ISREs is placed upstream of the CAT construct, inducible levels are as high as 50-fold. This fragment contains approximately 855 bp of the 1.4-kb sequence reported by Dai and Gupta (7Dai W. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19871-19877Google Scholar) and around 390 bp of downstream sequence including the transcriptional initiation site of Kadoya et al. (13Kadoya A. Tone S. Maeda H. Minatogawa Y. Kindo R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 530-536Google Scholar). The 855- and 390-bp fragments each contain an ISRE sequence. When cloned upstream of the CAT reporter vector, these fragments are induced poorly (about 7-fold) by IFN-γ. 5′ end deletions of the wild type promoter sequence indicate that removal of the first ISRE at position −1126 (ISRE1) leads to a 2-fold decrease in the promoter activity. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of ISRE1 also drops the promoter activity in a similar way (24-fold induction). This activity does not change appreciably when the promoter is deleted down to position −241 (130 bp away from the second ISRE). When ISRE1 is kept intact, deletion of a 161-bp fragment including the second ISRE at position −111 (ISRE2) shows only 11-fold induction of the promoter.Since the 1.4-kb fragment (Dai and Gupta, 7Dai W. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19871-19877Google Scholar) shares an 855-bp (5′ end) DNA sequence with the wild type promoter, it was interesting to determine if the remaining 390 bp (3′ end) of the promoter was sufficient to confer wild type activity. Transfection of the 390-bp fragment linked to the CAT reporter gene into ME180 cells alone shows only a 7-fold induction of the promoter. A similar induction (8-fold) is observed when the 855-bp fragment is transfected into ME180 cells. These results suggest that the cis-acting element(s) required for INDO promoter induction reside within or at the junction of the 855- and 390-bp fragments. 5′ end deletions of the wild type promoter were thus performed using exonuclease III. Since in all of these deletion mutants the ISRE2 sequence is still present, it is likely that ISRE2 and/or flanking sequences are responsible for the 20-28-fold induction observed. To determine the importance of ISRE2, a 161-bp sequence including ISRE2 was deleted from the promoter. Transfection with the resulting ΔISRE2 vector shows that the promoter is induced poorly (11-fold).The data from the deletion analyses suggest that ISRE1 and ISRE2 are two cis-acting elements critical for full INDO promoter induction. To confirm the importance of these elements, point mutations were introduced in either ISRE1 or ISRE2, and the effects of these mutations were analyzed. When T at positions −1124 and −1122 was changed to C and G, respectively, the resulting construct had a lower promoter induction (24-fold). This result is consistent with deleting ISRE1 and confirms the hypothesis that ISRE1 is indeed one of the INDO promoter cis-acting elements. In addition to deleting ISRE2, ΔISRE2 construct has also the X box (−114/−104) and Y box (−144/−135) removed. X and Y boxes are considered to be the essential components of the IFN-γ response region of major histocompatibility complex class II promoters (Benoist and Mathis, 2Benoist C. Mathis D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 681-715Google Scholar; Dorn et al., 9Dorn A. Durand B. Marfing C. Meur M.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6249-6253Google Scholar) and cannot be ruled out as part of INDO cis-acting elements. When point mutations were introduced in the ISRE2 sequence, the resulting construct showed only a 4-fold induction of the INDO promoter. These results indicate that the ISRE2 sequence, and probably not the X and Y boxes, is also required for induction of the INDO gene. Finally, deletion of a 748-bp EcoNI/PstI fragment between ISRE1 and ISRE2 shows that the distance between the two ISREs is not as important as the presence of these elements.In an attempt to analyze the transcriptional induction of the human INDO gene, its promoter has been subjected to deletions and point mutation analyses.

Removal of the ISRE (Briken et al., 3Briken V. Ruffner H. Schultz U. Schwarz A. Reis L.F. Strehlow I. Decker T. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell.

These transacting factors may come in contact through DNA looping at the complementary ISRE regions. Previous results have suggested that the INDO promoter is regulated by an ISRE-like element and GAS sequence found between positions −1126 and −1083 (Fig. 2) (Hassanain et al., 12Hassanain H.H. Chon S.Y. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5077-5084Google Scholar; Chon et al., 6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar). Chon et al. (6Chon S.Y. Hassanain H.H. Pine R. Gupta S.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 517-526Google Scholar) have shown that when this element was linked to a thymidine kinase-CAT reporter gene there was a 9-fold induction of CAT expression following transfection of GM00637 cells. We find similar levels of CAT expression when ME180 cells are transfected with this construct. However when the 1,245-base pair promoter region including two ISREs is placed upstream of the CAT construct, inducible levels are as high as 50-fold. This fragment contains approximately 855 bp of the 1.4-kb sequence reported by Dai and Gupta (7Dai W. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19871-19877Google Scholar) and around 390 bp of downstream sequence including the transcriptional initiation site of Kadoya et al. (13Kadoya A. Tone S. Maeda H. Minatogawa Y. Kindo R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 530-536Google Scholar). The 855- and 390-bp fragments each contain an ISRE sequence. When cloned upstream of the CAT reporter vector, these fragments are induced poorly (about 7-fold) by IFN-γ. 5′ end deletions of the wild type promoter sequence indicate that removal of the first ISRE at position −1126 (ISRE1) leads to a 2-fold decrease in the promoter activity. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of ISRE1 also drops the promoter activity in a similar way (24-fold induction). This activity does not change appreciably when the promoter is deleted down to position −241 (130 bp away from the second ISRE). When ISRE1 is kept intact, deletion of a 161-bp fragment including the second ISRE at position −111 (ISRE2) shows only 11-fold induction of the promoter. Since the 1.4-kb fragment (Dai and Gupta, 7Dai W. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19871-19877Google Scholar) shares an 855-bp (5′ end) DNA sequence with the wild type promoter, it was interesting to determine if the remaining 390 bp (3′ end) of the promoter was sufficient to confer wild type activity. Transfection of the 390-bp fragment linked to the CAT reporter gene into ME180 cells alone shows only a 7-fold induction of the promoter. A similar induction (8-fold) is observed when the 855-bp fragment is transfected into ME180 cells. These results suggest that the cis-acting element(s) required for INDO promoter induction reside within or at the junction of the 855- and 390-bp fragments. 5′ end deletions of the wild type promoter were thus performed using exonuclease III. Since in all of these deletion mutants the ISRE2 sequence is still present, it is likely that ISRE2 and/or flanking sequences are responsible for the 20-28-fold induction observed. To determine the importance of ISRE2, a 161-bp sequence including ISRE2 was deleted from the promoter. Transfection with the resulting ΔISRE2 vector shows that the promoter is induced poorly (11-fold). The data from the deletion analyses suggest that ISRE1 and ISRE2 are two cis-acting elements critical for full INDO promoter induction. To confirm the importance of these elements, point mutations were introduced in either ISRE1 or ISRE2, and the effects of these mutations were analyzed. When T at positions −1124 and −1122 was changed to C and G, respectively, the resulting construct had a lower promoter induction (24-fold). This result is consistent with deleting ISRE1 and confirms the hypothesis that ISRE1 is indeed one of the INDO promoter cis-acting elements. In addition to deleting ISRE2, ΔISRE2 construct has also the X box (−114/−104) and Y box (−144/−135) removed. X and Y boxes are considered to be the essential components of the IFN-γ response region of major histocompatibility complex class II promoters (Benoist and Mathis, 2Benoist C. Mathis D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 681-715Google Scholar; Dorn et al., 9Dorn A. Durand B. Marfing C. Meur M.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6249-6253Google Scholar) and cannot be ruled out as part of INDO cis-acting elements. When point mutations were introduced in the ISRE2 sequence, the resulting construct showed only a 4-fold induction of the INDO promoter. These results indicate that the ISRE2 sequence, and probably not the X and Y boxes, is also required for induction of the INDO gene. Finally, deletion of a 748-bp EcoNI/PstI fragment between ISRE1 and ISRE2 shows that the distance between the two ISREs is not as important as the presence of these elements. In an attempt to analyze the transcriptional induction of the human INDO gene, its promoter has been subjected to deletions and point mutation analyses. The results from these experiments strongly suggest that the INDO regulatory sequence spans at least a 1,245-bp fragment including two critical ISRE sequences. We hypothesize that following IFN-γ treatment, some newly synthesized factors bind to ISRE1 and ISRE2. INDO induction requires de novo protein synthesis since it is not induced in the presence of cycloheximide (Caplen and Gupta, 4Caplen H.S. Gupta S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 332-339Google Scholar). This implies that STAT 91 is not directly involved in INDO induction because it is constitutively made and is activated after phosphorylation. However, the IFN-γ-inducible IRF1 protein is synthesized de novo. IRF1 has recently been associated with the induction by IFN-γ of the mouse GBP (Briken et al., 3Briken V. Ruffner H. Schultz U. Schwarz A. Reis L.F. Strehlow I. Decker T. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 975-982Google Scholar). Mouse GBP contains two ISRE sequences in its promoter region. Removal of the ISRE (Briken et al., 3Briken V. Ruffner H. Schultz U. Schwarz A. Reis L.F. Strehlow I. Decker T. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 975-982Google Scholar; Nicolet and Paulnock, 19Nicolet C.M. Paulnock D.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 153-162Google Scholar) close to the transcription start site abolishes GBP induction. Cotransfection of the GBP promoter construct and IRF1 cDNA up-regulates GBP promoter activity (Briken et al., 3Briken V. Ruffner H. Schultz U. Schwarz A. Reis L.F. Strehlow I. Decker T. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 975-982Google Scholar). The INDO gene has also two ISRE elements in its regulatory sequence and is likely to be transcriptionally induced by IRF1. Indeed, Ozes and Taylor (20Ozes O.N. Taylor M.W. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 25-32Google Scholar) have shown by Northern blot analysis that overexpression of IRF1 can induce an INDO message in ME180 cells. Furthermore, gel mobility shift assay indicates that IRF1 binds to ISRE1 of the INDO promoter. We show in this paper that in HepG2 cells, in which INDO activity is not induced, a truncated IRF-1 is made, and Northern analysis indicates that IRF-1 mRNA does not accumulate after 4 h of treatment with IFN-γ, whereas in ME180 cells IRF-1 continues to accumulate up to 24-48 h after treatment. Together, these data argue for a role for IRF1 in INDO induction. We hypothesize that following IFN-γ treatment, some newly synthesized factors such as IRF1 (with possibly STAT 91 and/or other unknown factors) bind to ISRE1 and ISRE2. These transacting factors may come in contact through DNA looping at the complementary ISRE regions."

When the total plasma lipoprotein fractions isolated from nine distinct subjects were incubated for 24 h at 37°C with either purified PLTP or purified CETP, significant alterations in the relative proportions of the five distinct plasma HDL subpopulations, i.e., HDL2b (9.71-12.90 nm), HDL2a (8.77-9.71 nm), HDL3a (8.17-8.77 nm), HDL3b (7.76-8.17 nm), and HDL3c (7.21-7.76 nm) were also observed. PLTP induced a significant increase in the relative abundance of HDL2b (8.66 ± 2.34% versus 7.87 ± 1.83% in controls; p < 0.01) and a significant decrease in the relative abundance of HDL3a (32.76 ± 3.42% versus 37.87 ± 2.62% in controls; p < 0.05).

Taken together, data of the present study revealed that plasma PLTP and CETP can exert opposite effects on the size distribution of plasma HDL.

INTRODUCTIONSpermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) 1The abbreviation used is: SSATspermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase. is the rate-limiting step in polyamine catabolism that catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the N1 position of spermidine or spermine (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Seiler N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 3Seiler N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 250: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The acetylated polyamines are then excreted from the cell in their acetylated forms or are metabolized by the constitutive FAD-requiring polyamine oxidase. SSAT is a key component in the homeostatic system that maintains a narrow range of intracellular polyamines in eukaryotic cells. SSAT is normally induced in response to conditions that lead to rapid increases in the natural polyamines and to stress stimuli (4Fuller D.J. Carper S.W. Clay L. Chen J.-R. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Gerner E.W. Kurtis T.A. Fuller D.J.M. Casero R.A. Biochem.

Porter C.W. Liang Y. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The superinduction of SSAT by a series of antitumor polyamine analogues has been implicated in the cell type-specific cytotoxic response of several important human solid tumors (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bernacki R.J. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W.

Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 581-586PubMed Google Scholar). Since several of the polyamine analogues are now in or are being considered for clinical trial, a greater understanding of the role of SSAT and its precise mechanism of action is critical for the better design and use of these new antineoplastic agents.Although a kinetic model for the activity of this enzyme has previously been postulated by Della Ragione and Pegg (12Della Ragione F. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to be an ordered Bi Bi molecular reaction where the natural polyamine is bound first and the acetylated polyamine is released last, little is known about the specific molecular domains required for activity. The molecular cloning of the human SSAT gene, cDNA, and microsequencing of most of the purified human protein have allowed a more detailed study of the residues and domains required for enzyme activity (13Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol.

The human SSAT gene codes for a 171-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of ~20,000 and is thought to be active as a homotrimeric or homotetrameric protein (17Libby P.R. Ganis B. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SSAT protein and enzyme activity are normally undetectable in cells that have not been induced. However, in polyamine analogue-responsive cells, the superinduction of SSAT expression can result in a >1000-fold increase in protein activity that is entirely a result of new protein synthesis (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar). In extreme cases, the induction can result in SSAT approaching 1% total cellular protein (13Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The induction of SSAT is a result of a complex series of events that starts with the induction of transcription of the SSAT gene and involves the stabilization of the SSAT mRNA, increased translational efficiency, and stabilization of the SSAT protein by the natural polyamines and their analogues (5Gerner E.W. Kurtis T.A. Fuller D.J.M. Casero R.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol.

(20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have recently reported on a domain of the human SSAT protein that appears to be responsible for the stabilization of SSAT by the polyamine analogue N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine and may additionally act as part of the natural polyamine-binding/catalytic site.In this study, we attempted to determine what regions of the human protein are required for acetyl-CoA binding and enzyme activity of the human SSAT protein. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro transcription/translation, and extensive data base homology searching, we identified a region of high homology in the human SSAT protein that is necessary for activity and is highly conserved among several microbial antibiotic N-acetyltransferases that use acetyl-CoA as a substrate. The data in the current study demonstrate that the human SSAT protein can be considered as a member of an evolutionarily conserved superfamily of N-acetyltransferases.DISCUSSIONSSAT is the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism, and its superinduction appears to be associated with sensitivity to certain antitumor polyamine analogues (1Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Its recent cloning has provided a means to examine the specific regions of the protein required for enzyme activity and to gain a better understanding of potential structural targets for use in antitumor drug development.Our goal was to identify those regions required for the acetyl-CoA binding. The amino acids chosen for site-directed mutagenesis studies were based on multiple criteria. Histidine residues have been implicated in the activity of other acetyltransferases, particularly choline acetyltransferase (31Carbini L. Rodriquez G. Hersh L.B. Brain Res. Bull. 1990; 24: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Currier S.F. Mautner H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3355-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most importantly, sequence analysis of the human SSAT protein revealed a significant homology with highly conserved domains of a superfamily of microbial antibiotic acetyltransferases (33Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our current work clearly defines a region of homology between distantly related N-acetyltransferases, referred to here as Domain I, that contains the RGFGIGS motif and is critical for the activity of the human acetyltransferase. Although similar motifs have been postulated to be important in acetyl-CoA binding (33Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there are no reports that have provided site-directed mutational data to support this hypothesis. Della Ragione et al. (34Della Ragione F. Erwin B.G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) predicted that the acetyl-CoA binding site would contain at least one arginine. This hypothesis was based on treatment of purified rat SSAT with reagents known to react with arginine residues. An arginine residue has also recently been demonstrated to be critical in the binding of acetyl-CoA to the active site of rat choline acetyltransferase (35Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONSpermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) 1The abbreviation used is: SSATspermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase. is the rate-limiting step in polyamine catabolism that catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the N1 position of spermidine or spermine (1Casero R.A.

The acetylated polyamines are then excreted from the cell in their acetylated forms or are metabolized by the constitutive FAD-requiring polyamine oxidase. SSAT is a key component in the homeostatic system that maintains a narrow range of intracellular polyamines in eukaryotic cells. SSAT is normally induced in response to conditions that lead to rapid increases in the natural polyamines and to stress stimuli (4Fuller D.J. Carper S.W. Clay L. Chen J.-R. Gerner E.W. Biochem.

The superinduction of SSAT by a series of antitumor polyamine analogues has been implicated in the cell type-specific cytotoxic response of several important human solid tumors (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bernacki R.J. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W.

Bergeron R.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 581-586PubMed Google Scholar). Since several of the polyamine analogues are now in or are being considered for clinical trial, a greater understanding of the role of SSAT and its precise mechanism of action is critical for the better design and use of these new antineoplastic agents.Although a kinetic model for the activity of this enzyme has previously been postulated by Della Ragione and Pegg (12Della Ragione F. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to be an ordered Bi Bi molecular reaction where the natural polyamine is bound first and the acetylated polyamine is released last, little is known about the specific molecular domains required for activity. The molecular cloning of the human SSAT gene, cDNA, and microsequencing of most of the purified human protein have allowed a more detailed study of the residues and domains required for enzyme activity (13Casero R.A.

The human SSAT gene codes for a 171-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of ~20,000 and is thought to be active as a homotrimeric or homotetrameric protein (17Libby P.R. Ganis B. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SSAT protein and enzyme activity are normally undetectable in cells that have not been induced. However, in polyamine analogue-responsive cells, the superinduction of SSAT expression can result in a >1000-fold increase in protein activity that is entirely a result of new protein synthesis (8Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Libby P.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3829-3833PubMed Google Scholar). In extreme cases, the induction can result in SSAT approaching 1% total cellular protein (13Casero R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The induction of SSAT is a result of a complex series of events that starts with the induction of transcription of the SSAT gene and involves the stabilization of the SSAT mRNA, increased translational efficiency, and stabilization of the SSAT protein by the natural polyamines and their analogues (5Gerner E.W.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have recently reported on a domain of the human SSAT protein that appears to be responsible for the stabilization of SSAT by the polyamine analogue N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine and may additionally act as part of the natural polyamine-binding/catalytic site.In this study, we attempted to determine what regions of the human protein are required for acetyl-CoA binding and enzyme activity of the human SSAT protein. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro transcription/translation, and extensive data base homology searching, we identified a region of high homology in the human SSAT protein that is necessary for activity and is highly conserved among several microbial antibiotic N-acetyltransferases that use acetyl-CoA as a substrate. The data in the current study demonstrate that the human SSAT protein can be considered as a member of an evolutionarily conserved superfamily of N-acetyltransferases.

Its recent cloning has provided a means to examine the specific regions of the protein required for enzyme activity and to gain a better understanding of potential structural targets for use in antitumor drug development.Our goal was to identify those regions required for the acetyl-CoA binding. The amino acids chosen for site-directed mutagenesis studies were based on multiple criteria. Histidine residues have been implicated in the activity of other acetyltransferases, particularly choline acetyltransferase (31Carbini L. Rodriquez G. Hersh L.B. Brain Res. Bull. 1990; 24: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Currier S.F. Mautner H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3355-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most importantly, sequence analysis of the human SSAT protein revealed a significant homology with highly conserved domains of a superfamily of microbial antibiotic acetyltransferases (33Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our current work clearly defines a region of homology between distantly related N-acetyltransferases, referred to here as Domain I, that contains the RGFGIGS motif and is critical for the activity of the human acetyltransferase. Although similar motifs have been postulated to be important in acetyl-CoA binding (33Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there are no reports that have provided site-directed mutational data to support this hypothesis. Della Ragione et al. (34Della Ragione F. Erwin B.G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) predicted that the acetyl-CoA binding site would contain at least one arginine. This hypothesis was based on treatment of purified rat SSAT with reagents known to react with arginine residues. An arginine residue has also recently been demonstrated to be critical in the binding of acetyl-CoA to the active site of rat choline acetyltransferase (35Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29111-29116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results demonstrating that the R101A mutant is completely inactive supports the hypothesis that an arginine is part of the active site of human SSAT. It is also not surprising that the human SSAT protein bears greatest homology to the antibiotic acetyltransferase with a targeted nitrogen that is associated with a moiety most like the polyamines in structure.Glycine loops have been postulated to be critical in the binding of mono- and dinucleotide substrates, and Schulz (27Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar) has proposed that lack of bulky side chains typified by glycine loops are necessary to allow the nucleotide binding without steric hindrance. A common feature of the N-acetyltransferases is the α-helix that begins in the glycine loop area homologous to the RGFGIGS motif of SSAT.

Most importantly, sequence analysis of the human SSAT protein revealed a significant homology with highly conserved domains of a superfamily of microbial antibiotic acetyltransferases (33Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current work clearly defines a region of homology between distantly related N-acetyltransferases, referred to here as Domain I, that contains the RGFGIGS motif and is critical for the activity of the human acetyltransferase. Although similar motifs have been postulated to be important in acetyl-CoA binding (33Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there are no reports that have provided site-directed mutational data to support this hypothesis. Della Ragione et al. (34Della Ragione F. Erwin B.G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) predicted that the acetyl-CoA binding site would contain at least one arginine. This hypothesis was based on treatment of purified rat SSAT with reagents known to react with arginine residues. An arginine residue has also recently been demonstrated to be critical in the binding of acetyl-CoA to the active site of rat choline acetyltransferase (35Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29111-29116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results demonstrating that the R101A mutant is completely inactive supports the hypothesis that an arginine is part of the active site of human SSAT. It is also not surprising that the human SSAT protein bears greatest homology to the antibiotic acetyltransferase with a targeted nitrogen that is associated with a moiety most like the polyamines in structure. Glycine loops have been postulated to be critical in the binding of mono- and dinucleotide substrates, and Schulz (27Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar) has proposed that lack of bulky side chains typified by glycine loops are necessary to allow the nucleotide binding without steric hindrance. A common feature of the N-acetyltransferases is the α-helix that begins in the glycine loop area homologous to the RGFGIGS motif of SSAT. Both the relative activity and preliminary kinetics from the mutants strongly suggest that this region is the site of acetyl-CoA binding. However, final confirmation of the importance of this region is that SSAT activity will require crystallographic analysis of the purified human SSAT. Domain II appears to be less conserved among the various representative acetyltransferases. However, two residues are highly conserved in this region. The glycine corresponding to Gly-144 is conserved among all of the microbial acetyltransferases and the mammalian serotonin N-acetyltransferases. The hamster SSAT (24Pegg A.E. Stanely B.A. Wiest L. Casero R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which only has six differences in amino acid structure and no differences between the human SSAT in Domain I, has an alanine in the 144 position. Tyr-140 is the second most conserved residue in Domain II and suggests the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation may have some role in the activity or regulation of the acetyltransferases. During the preparation of this article, Borjigin et al. and Coon et al. reported the cloning and primary structure of rat (28Borjigin J. Wang M.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1995; 378: 783-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and sheep (29Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Baler R. Weller J.L. Namboodiri M.A.A. Koonin E.V. Klein D.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1681-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) serotonin N-acetyltransferases. Each of the proteins conforms to the consensus regions reported here, and Coon et al. (29Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Baler R. Weller J.L. Namboodiri M.A.A. Koonin E.V. Klein D.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1681-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) presented similar domains which they defined as Motifs I and II. Recent work by Coleman et al. (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) convincingly demonstrated that the most carboxyl-terminal region of SSAT, consisting of the amino acids MATEE, is critical for polyamine and polyamine analogue binding which in turn lead to stabilization of SSAT. Their results also suggest that this region may be critical for catalytic activity. Mutations of acidic residues different from those reported by Coleman et al. (20Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), E92A and D93A, produced proteins with activities reduced >85%. These acidic residues may be similar in function to the glutamates in the MATEE region with regard to polyamine binding and enzyme activity. In the current study, the effects of mutations of the putative acetyl-CoA binding site on enzyme stability were not studied. It is unlikely that the stability of SSAT would be controlled by intracellular acetyl-CoA concentration since polyamine homeostasis, not acetyl-CoA regulation, is the primary function of SSAT. Although SSAT protein is routinely prepared in the presence of high polyamine concentrations for maintenance of stability, acetyl-CoA is not usually added, suggesting that it is not required for enzyme stability. However, some of the mutations made in the current study may significantly affect enzyme conformation, which could lead to a less stable protein. In summary, the mutation of several residues in Domain I, which is presented as a putative acetyl-CoA-binding site of the human SSAT, leads to inactivation of the enzyme. The increased Km for acetyl-CoA in the partially active G102D mutant strengthens the hypothesis that the RGFGIGS region is critical for acetyl-CoA binding and enzyme activity. Additionally, the lack of measurable activity of the R101A mutant is consistent with the hypothesis that an arginine is required for acetyl-CoA binding and enzyme activity (34Della Ragione F. Erwin B.G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29111-29116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

INTRODUCTIONFibronectin (FN) 1The abbreviations used are: FNfibronectinEDextra type III domainPCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptasekbkilobase(s). is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein present in body tissues and fluids. Functionally, it is important in such diverse activities as cell adhesion, cell migration, cellular differentiation, blood clotting, opsonization, wound healing, and neoplastic transformation (Hynes, 10Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Fibronectin protein structure consists predominantly of three types of homologous repeating units (designated I, II, and III). It is encoded by a single gene, but significant protein heterogeneity results from alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA at three sites, termed extra type III domain A (ED-A), extra type III domain B (ED-B), and the variable (V) region (Schwarzbauer, 22Schwarzbauer J.E. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The V region is sometimes also referred to as the connecting segment between the 14th and 15th type III homologous repeats (IIICS). Exons encoding ED-A and ED-B are spliced in or out in their entirety. In the V region of rat FN transcripts, however, a single 5′-splice donor site combines with one of three different 3′-splice acceptor sites (exon subdivision). In the human, an additional internal 5′-splice donor site is present and results in two more V region splice variants (Vibe-Pedersen et al., 26Vibe-Pedersen K. Kornblihtt A.R. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2511-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; Kornblihtt et al., 12Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Fibronectin is an important matrix constituent in cartilage, and its content is markedly elevated in articular cartilage lesions within osteoarthritic joints (Wurster and Lust, 28Wurster N.B. Lust G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar; Burton-Wurster et al., 5Burton-Wurster N. Butler M. Harter S.J. Colombo C. Quintavalla J. Swartzendurber D. Arsenis C. Lust G. J. Rheumatol. 1986; 13: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise functional role of FN in normal and diseased cartilage is unknown, several unique structural features have been described. Relatively high levels of the (ED-B)+ isoform have been found in both canine and human cartilage FN (Burton-Wurster et al., 7Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Wert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 29Zhang D. Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 1817-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 30Zhang D. Burton-Wurster N. Lust G.

Cart. 1995; 3: 187-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A small subset of cartilage FN appears to be post-translationally modified with the addition of a chondroitin or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (Burton-Wurster and Lust, 4Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have also observed that canine cartilage FN has a subunit with an apparent molecular mass ~15 kDa less than the smallest subunit of plasma FN. This subunit fails to react with two monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes in the III-15 segment, although at least some of these smaller subunits were still found within FN dimers (Burton-Wurster and Lust, 3Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These protein data are consistent with those of a subunit that retains the two sulfhydryl groups in the carboxyl terminus necessary for dimerization but has an internal deletion of the III-15 segment. In this study, we have examined the alternative splicing patterns of FN mRNA in articular cartilage. The results demonstrate a previously unreported splice variant that extends beyond any of the known 3′-acceptor sites in the V region and deletes nucleotides that would normally encode the 15th type III homology repeat (III-15) and the 10th type I homology repeat (I-10). This new splicing pattern is present in a majority of FN transcripts within articular cartilage and accounts for the small subunit of FN protein previously described.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate a new FN splicing pattern in articular cartilage that extends beyond the normal V region. This new FN splice variant is not present in the liver and is lost over time when chondrocytes are removed from their extracellular matrix and placed in monolayer cultures. We have termed this splice variant (V+C)−. “C” denotes the cartilage-sensitive region that includes 411 nucleotides that would normally be translated into the III-15 and I-10 segments in FN protein. The absence of nucleotides encoding III-15 in the (V+C)− splice variant readily explains our previous observation that two monoclonal antibodies specific for epitopes within this segment fail to recognize the small cartilage FN protein subunits in Western blots (Burton-Wurster and Lust, 3Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Chondrocytes cultured in monolayer for up to 46 days demonstrate a progressive decrease in steady-state levels of (V+C)− FN broadly parallel to the loss of type II procollagen expression. Since an RT-PCR assay was used to follow the changes in FN splicing, however, these data do not determine exact quantitative relationships. Alternative splicing of ED-A has previously been associated with chondrocyte de-differentiation. (ED-A)+ FN is not normally expressed in cartilage but appears when chondrocytes are cultured and is further increased in passaged monolayer cells (Burton-Wurster et al., 6Burton-Wurster N. Leipold H.R. Lust G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar; Burton-Wurster and Lust, 3Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; Bennett et al., 2Bennett V.D. Pallante K.M. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5918-5924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of (ED-A)+ FN can be modulated by the addition of dibutyryl cAMP (Leipold et al., 13Leipold H.R. Burton-Wurster N. Steinmeyer J. Vernier-Singer M.S. Lust G. J. Orthop. Res. 1992; 10: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or transforming growth factor β1 (Zhang et al., 29Zhang D. Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 1817-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, (ED-B)+ FN mRNA, which is expressed at high levels by chondrocytes within articular cartilage (15-35%), remains relatively high in primary chondrocyte cultures (18%), is insensitive to the addition of transforming growth factor β1, but is decreased by the addition of dibutyryl cAMP to the culture medium (Zhang et al., 29Zhang D. Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 1817-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Loss of the cartilage-specific (V+C)− splicing pattern of FN along with the appearance of the (ED-A)+ isoform may prove to be an early and even more sensitive marker of chondrocyte de-differentiation in culture than is the loss of type II procollagen and aggrecan core protein expression.Since the liver is the primary source of plasma FN, the two splice variants generated by RT/PCR from both equine and canine liver RNA are consistent with a distribution in which approximately half of the protein subunits lack the V region and half include all or a part of the V region. This is similar to what has been reported for mouse, human, rat, and cow but unlike that for the chicken in which no FN transcripts have the V region totally excluded (Schwarzbauer et al., 23Schwarzbauer J.E. Paul J.I. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1424-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Kornblihtt et al., 12Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar; Norton and Hynes, 17Norton P.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4297-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar; Schwarzbauer, 22Schwarzbauer J.E. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For human and rat FN, the V region and the first half of the III-15 segment are encoded by one exon (Tamkun et al., 25Tamkun J.W. Schwarzbauer J.E. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5140-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar; Vibe-Pedersen et al., 27Vibe-Pedersen K. Magnusson S. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There is, however, an internal acceptor site immediately preceding the bases encoding III-15 that permits the entire V region to be spliced out. This region is conserved in the dog and horse, as is the alternative splice acceptor site that results in a deletion of the first 25 amino acids of the V region. In humans but not in the rat, an alternative splice donor site (GAG, beginning at base 881, Fig. 4A) permits deletion of the final 31 amino acids in the V region and accounts for the total of five different FN splice variants in the V region of humans versus only three in the rat. The comparable sequence in the dog and horse is GAG, which is identical to that in the rat. Loss of the invariant GT dinucleotide suggests that the dog and horse, like the rat, will have only three splice variants within the V region and not five.In addition to the smaller and cartilage-specific (V+C)− isoform, we also detected by Northern blot hybridization and RT-PCR, FN transcripts in cartilage that have a size consistent with V region splicing patterns comparable to that observed in the liver. Burton-Wurster and Lust (3Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) previously estimated that cartilage FN was 80% V+. This was based on the generation of a high percentage of a 30-kDa heparin binding fragment after thermolysin digestion, reflecting the presumed insertion of the thermolysin-sensitive V region between the type III-14 and III-15 segments (Pande et al., 19Pande H. Calaycay J. Lee T.D. Legesse K. Shively J.E. Siri A. Borsi L. Zardi L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The accuracy of this assay, however, is invalidated by the deletion of the III-15 domain in the (V+C)− isoform. Therefore, based on the transcriptional results reported here, the earlier quantitative estimate of V+ appears to be much too high. Rencic et al. (20Rencic A. Gehris A.L. Lewis S.D. Hume E.L. Bennett V.D. Osteoarth. Cart. 1995; 3: 187-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported that FN splicing in seven human articular cartilage samples exhibited a pattern in which the V region was deleted. They would not, however, have been able to identify the (V+C)− splice variant since the antisense primer they chose for PCR amplification was within the I-10 region.From the Northern analysis data in Fig. 1, it is clear that the cartilage-specific (V+C)− splice variant may include or exclude the ED-B segment. Direct quantitation of 32P-labeled decay events on the hybridization membrane by phosphoimager analysis (Fuji BioImaging, Stamford, CT) suggests the following approximate distribution of FN transcripts in adult equine articular cartilage: 63% ((B−,A−,(V+C)−)), 21% (B+,A−,(V+C)−), 11% (B−,A−,V+/−,C+), and 5% (B+,A−,V+/−,C+). In total, the 26:74 ratio of B+:B− transcripts is entirely consistent with published observations (Zhang et al., 29Zhang D. Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 1817-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Rencic et al., 20Rencic A. Gehris A.L. Lewis S.D. Hume E.L. Bennett V.D. Osteoarth. Cart. 1995; 3: 187-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that the percentage of (ED-B)+ transcripts is 25% in (V+C)− splice variants, which is roughly comparable to the 31% in the V+/−,C+ splice variants. Based on the observed patterns of alternative RNA splicing, the predicted major protein isoforms of FN expressed in adult equine articular cartilage are summarized in Fig. 8. PCR data with primer pair 6 also support, however, the presence of other minor V region splice variants in cartilage (Figs. 2, 3, and 7). These minor variants were not independently resolved by our Northern blot analyses. The possibility of subdivisions within the C region (nucleotides encoding III-15 and I-10) must also be considered and is not resolved by these data.Functions for some of the splice variants in the V region have been investigated and include the identification of sites that are important for cell adhesion and FN dimer secretion and the ability to affect covalent cross-linking in fibrin clots (Schwarzbauer, 22Schwarzbauer J.E. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Functions for the ED-B and ED-A regions remain speculative but may be related to the assembly of FN dimers into pre-existing matrices. Consistent with that idea, Zhang et al. (30Zhang D. Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14 (b): 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have shown that newly synthesized (ED-B)+ FN is preferentially retained in the cartilage matrix compared with that of (ED-B)− FN.The tissue-specific pattern of (V+C)− expression and its loss by chondrocytes in monolayer culture suggest that this FN isoform may play an important role in articular cartilage matrix organization. It is not yet known if the (V+C)− splice variant is also a predominant isoform in other cartilaginous tissues such as meniscal, nasal, costal, and tracheal cartilage. Tracheal cartilage in particular will be of interest since Zhang et al. (29Zhang D. Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 1817-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) found that it is the only cartilaginous tissue that does not express the (ED-B)+ isoform of FN. At present, we have no idea what properties the loss of the III-15 and I-10 segments may confer on the mature FN protein. The III-15 domain contains a sulfhydryl group that may be involved with intermolecular disulfide bonding, although there is some evidence to the contrary (Morla et al., 15Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Ichihara-Tanaka et al. (11Ichihara-Tanaka K. Titani K. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that III-15 and the I-10 through I-12 segments are actively involved in matrix assembly and that deletion of only one of the three type I segments will markedly impair matrix assembly activity. A disulfide cross-linked “super-fibronectin” with enhanced adhesive properties (Morla et al. 15Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) may be close to the natural matrix form of FN but may be inappropriate for cartilage. In addition, the juxtaposition of the III-14 and I-11 segments in the (V+C)− isoform of FN, which replaces the I-10 and I-11 junction, predicts amino acid substitutions of an acidic glutamate for a basic lysine residue in the equine and canine sequences and a glycine residue for the basic arginine residue in humans (Fig. 4B). When combined, these changes may result in alterations of the FN tertiary structure that convey additional new properties to this isoform. FN fragments but not intact FN have been reported to induce the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes in cartilage explants (Homandberg et al., 9Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Xie D. J. Biol.

If the (V+C)− splice variant mimics a FN fragment in this regard, it may have an important regulatory role to play in matrix metalloproteinase activity within articular cartilage. Although these and other possibilities need to be independently investigated, the tissue-specific pattern of (V+C)− FN expression suggests that this isoform has an important function in articular cartilage. INTRODUCTIONFibronectin (FN) 1The abbreviations used are: FNfibronectinEDextra type III domainPCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptasekbkilobase(s). is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein present in body tissues and fluids. Functionally, it is important in such diverse activities as cell adhesion, cell migration, cellular differentiation, blood clotting, opsonization, wound healing, and neoplastic transformation (Hynes, 10Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Fibronectin protein structure consists predominantly of three types of homologous repeating units (designated I, II, and III). It is encoded by a single gene, but significant protein heterogeneity results from alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA at three sites, termed extra type III domain A (ED-A), extra type III domain B (ED-B), and the variable (V) region (Schwarzbauer, 22Schwarzbauer J.E. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The V region is sometimes also referred to as the connecting segment between the 14th and 15th type III homologous repeats (IIICS). Exons encoding ED-A and ED-B are spliced in or out in their entirety. In the V region of rat FN transcripts, however, a single 5′-splice donor site combines with one of three different 3′-splice acceptor sites (exon subdivision). In the human, an additional internal 5′-splice donor site is present and results in two more V region splice variants (Vibe-Pedersen et al., 26Vibe-Pedersen K. Kornblihtt A.R. Baralle F.E.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Fibronectin is an important matrix constituent in cartilage, and its content is markedly elevated in articular cartilage lesions within osteoarthritic joints (Wurster and Lust, 28Wurster N.B. Lust G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar; Burton-Wurster et al., 5Burton-Wurster N. Butler M. Harter S.J. Colombo C. Quintavalla J. Swartzendurber D. Arsenis C. Lust G. J. Rheumatol. 1986; 13: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise functional role of FN in normal and diseased cartilage is unknown, several unique structural features have been described. Relatively high levels of the (ED-B)+ isoform have been found in both canine and human cartilage FN (Burton-Wurster et al., 7Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Wert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 29Zhang D. Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. J. Biol.

Cart. 1995; 3: 187-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A small subset of cartilage FN appears to be post-translationally modified with the addition of a chondroitin or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (Burton-Wurster and Lust, 4Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have also observed that canine cartilage FN has a subunit with an apparent molecular mass ~15 kDa less than the smallest subunit of plasma FN. This subunit fails to react with two monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes in the III-15 segment, although at least some of these smaller subunits were still found within FN dimers (Burton-Wurster and Lust, 3Burton-Wurster N. Lust G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These protein data are consistent with those of a subunit that retains the two sulfhydryl groups in the carboxyl terminus necessary for dimerization but has an internal deletion of the III-15 segment. In this study, we have examined the alternative splicing patterns of FN mRNA in articular cartilage. The results demonstrate a previously unreported splice variant that extends beyond any of the known 3′-acceptor sites in the V region and deletes nucleotides that would normally encode the 15th type III homology repeat (III-15) and the 10th type I homology repeat (I-10). This new splicing pattern is present in a majority of FN transcripts within articular cartilage and accounts for the small subunit of FN protein previously described."
https://openalex.org/W2015401371,"The visual pigment rhodopsin is a prototypical member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. In this study, we have investigated the effect of a series of <i>n</i>-alcohols on the formation of metarhodopsin II (MII), the photoactivated conformation of rhodopsin, which binds and activates transducin. When rhodopsin was photolyzed in the presence of several <i>n</i>-alcohols, increased MII formation was observed in the order ethanol > butanol > hexanol, whereas longer chain <i>n</i>-alcohols inhibited MII formation with decanol > octanol. The magnitude of the stimulatory effects was greater in a more highly unsaturated phospholipid. Alcohols, which enhanced MII formation also increased phospholipid acyl chain packing free volume, while those that decreased this bilayer property inhibited MII formation. An apparent discontinuity in the effect of these alcohols results when their potency is calculated in terms of the total aqueous alcohol concentration. In sharp contrast, a continuous variation in their behavior is observed, when their potency is calculated in terms of the amount of alcohol partitioned in the membrane. Our findings strongly support a lipid-mediated mechanism of action for alcohols on rhodopsin and, by analogy, for other G protein-coupled receptors."

Y. (1992) Science 257, 1225-1230; Shen, N. V., Chen X., Boyer, M. M., and Pfaffinger, P. (1993) Neuron 11, 67-76). It is referred to as a first tetramerization domain, or T1 (Shen, N. V., Chen X., Boyer, M. M., and Pfaffinger, P. (1993) Neuron 11, 67-76). However, a deletion mutant of Kv1.3 that lacks the first 141 amino acids, Kv1.3 (T1−) forms functional channels, suggesting that additional association sites in the central core of Kv1.3 mediate oligomerization. To characterize these sites, we have tested the abilities of cRNA Kv1.3 (T1−) fragments co-injected with Kv1.3 (T1−) to suppress current in Xenopus oocytes. The fragments include portions of the six putative transmembrane segments, S1 through S6, specifically: S1, S1-S2, S1-S2-S3, S2-S3, S2-S3-S4, S3-S4, S3-S4-S5, S2 through COOH, S3 through COOH, S4 through COOH, and S5-S6-COOH. Electrophysiologic experiments show that the fragments S1-S2-S3, S3-S4-S5, S2 through COOH, and S3 through COOH strongly suppress Kv1.3 (T1−) current, while others do not. Suppression of expressed current is due to specific effects of the translated peptide Kv1.3 fragments, as validated by in vivo immunoprecipitation studies of a strong suppressor and a nonsuppressor. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that translation of truncated peptide fragments neither prevents translation of Kv1.3 (T1−) nor increases its rate of degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that suppression involves direct association of a peptide fragment with Kv1.3 (T1−). Fragments that strongly suppress Kv1.3 (T1−) also suppress an analogous NH2-terminal deletion mutant of Kv2.1 (Kv2.1 (ΔN139)), an isoform belonging to a different subfamily.

This sequence is referred to as the first tetramerization domain, “T1” (3Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It may serve both as a selective barrier against interfamily mixing of isoforms as well as an adhesive agent providing additional stabilization of permitted intrafamily heteromultimer assembly (1Tu L. Santarelli V. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Lee T.E. Phillipson L.H. Kuznetsov A. Nelson D.J. Biophys.

Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and viral antigens (9Boulay F. Doms R.W. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of voltage-gated K+ channels, transmembrane segments, in addition to T1, play a special role in stabilization (1Tu L. Santarelli V. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine the specific primary amino acid sequences involved in these intersubunit interactions, we have studied heterologously expressed wild-type and mutant Kv1.3 currents in Xenopus oocytes. The mutant lacks the first 441 bases (141 amino acids) of the NH2 terminus containing the T1 domain and is referred to as Kv1.3 (T1−). In this paper, we show that sites in the central core of Kv1.3, in addition to the T1 domain in the NH2 terminus, mediate intersubunit association. Moreover, these sites are sufficient for correct assembly of functional Kv1.3 channels. We have also studied the ability of peptide fragments of Kv1.3 (T1−) to suppress currents of co-expressed Kv1.3 (T1−) channels and show that sites in the central core of the channel also mediate suppression. These suppression sites appear to be conserved across K+ channel subfamilies and may be identical to the association sites, thereby serving as promiscuous recognition motifs. Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis females (Xenopus I, Michigan) as described previously (10Chahine M. Chen L. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Horn R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1992; 24: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Stage V-VI oocytes were selected and microinjected with 10-40 or 24 ng of cRNA encoding for Kv1.3 (T1−) and for a Shab-like NH2-terminal deletion mutant, Kv2.1 (ΔN139), respectively. The mole ratio of cRNA injected for full-length K+ channel gene to truncated K+ channel gene was 1:2. K+ currents from cRNA-injected oocytes were measured with two-microelectrode voltage clamp using a TEC 01C oocyte clamp (NPI Electronic Gmbh, Tamm, Germany) after 24-48 h, at which time currents were 2-10 µA. This level of expressed current was optimal for observing suppression. Electrodes (<1 MΩ) contained 3 M KCl. The bath Ringer's solution contained 116 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.6). The holding potential was −100 mV. All cRNA was transcribed from linearized inserts in pGEM 9zf(−) vectors for oocyte expression (1Tu L. Santarelli V. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Standard methods of plasmid DNA preparation, restriction enzymes analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, and bacterial transformation were used. All isolated fragments were purified with Geneclean (Bio 101), re-circularized using T4 DNA ligase, and then used to transform DH5α™ or XL1-Blue competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The nucleotide sequences at the 5′-ends of all of NH2-terminal deletion mutants and at the 3′-ends of all COOH-terminal deletion mutants were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis or by DNA sequence analysis (Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants were constructed using native restriction endonuclease sites. Kv1.3(T1−) was made by deleting an EcoRI/NcoI-digested fragment from pGEM9zf(−)/Kv1.3, which was then filled in by using the Klenow reaction and religating the blunt ends. A similar strategy was used to construct the other deletion mutants. 1) Truncated Kv1.3(S2-COOH) was partially digested with SmaI(+34)/NaeI(+694). 2) Truncated Kv1.3(S3-COOH) was digested with EcoRI/NruI. 3) Truncated Kv1.3(S4-COOH) was digested with EcoRI/KpnI. 4) Truncated Kv1.3(S5-COOH) was made using an EcoRI/PstI digestion. 5) Truncated Kv1.3(S1) was made using an EcoRI/NcoI digestion of pGEM9zf(−)/truncated Kv1.3(+671) (11Tu L. Sheng Z.F. Panyi G. Santarelli V. Pain D. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); 6) Truncated Kv1.3(S1-S2) was made using a NruI/HindIII digestion of pGEM9zf(−)/Kv1.3 (T1−). 7) Truncated Kv1.3(S1-S2-S3) was made using a BstxI/HindIII digestion of pGEM9zf(−)/Kv1.3 (T1−). 8) Truncated Kv1.3(S2-S3) was made using BstxI/HindIII digestion of pGEM9zf(−)/Kv1.3 (S2-COOH). 9) Truncated Kv1.3(S2-S3-S4) was made using PstI/NsiI digestion of pGEM9zf(−)/Kv1.3(S2-COOH). 10) Truncated Kv1.3(S3-S4) was made using EcoRI/NruI digestion of truncated Kv1.3(S2-S3-S4), 11) Truncated Kv1.3(S3-S4-S5) was made using BstEII/SpeI digestion of truncated Kv1.3(S3-COOH). All of the above constructs were made using internal Kv1.3 ATG sites. To achieve higher translation efficiencies in vitro for S2-S3 and S2-S3-S4, additional constructs were made. A PpuMI/NaeI-digested fragment from pGEM9zf(−)/Kv1.3(S2-S3) or pGEM9zf(−)/Kv1.3(S2-S3-S4) was ligated into a PpuMI/NaeI-digested pGEM9zf(−)/Kv1.3(S2) to give the modified pGEM9zf(−)M/Kv1.3(S2-S3) or pGEM9zf(−)M/Kv1.3(S2-S3-S4), respectively, in which ~150 bp of the 5′-nontranslated region were deleted and only three bp (one amino acid) exist between the ATG start codon and base +694. All S2-S3 and S2-S3-S4 constructs gave similar results in vivo and similar molecular weight peptides in vitro. For truncated Kv2.1 (ΔN139), a ClaI-digested fragment was deleted from pBluescript SK(−)/Kv2.1 and religated to give Kv2.1 (ΔN139). Capped mRNA was synthesized in vitro from linearized templates using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Proteins were translated in vitro with [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes, according to the Promega Protocol and Application Guide. In some cases, globin protein was removed from the membrane-associated translation products prior to SDS-PAGE by layering 10-40 µl of the reaction products on a 200-µl sucrose cushion (0.5 M sucrose, 100 mM KCl, 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol), centrifuging the samples at 70,000 rpm using a TLA 100 Beckman rotor Optima™ in a TLX ultracentrifuge for 10 min and dissolving the resulting pellet in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Electrophoresis was performed on CBS Scientific gel apparatus using 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels made according to standard protocols, or Tricine gels according to standard Sigma protocols (Sigma Technical Bulletin, MWM-100). Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. Gels were soaked in Amplify (Amersham Corp.) to enhance 35S fluorography, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −70°C. Quantitation of gels was carried out directly using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). In vitro transcribed mRNA was mixed with [35S]methionine/cysteine (10× concentration; Tran35S-label, ICN (Irvine, CA) 20 µCi/µl; 0.9 methionine, 0.1 cysteine) and injected directly into oocytes (50 nl/oocyte) as described above. Co-injections of full-length Kv1.3 (T1−) and truncated cRNA were carried out in a molar ratio of 1:2. Following incubation in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 18°C for 4 h in methionine/cysteine-free medium, the medium was changed to a 1 mM methionine, 1 mM cysteine medium. For each time point, 5-7 oocytes were frozen (−80°C). Later, all samples were thawed and homogenized in 5× volumes (35 µl) of homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KAc, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) while kept on ice. To the oocyte homogenate, 1% SDS, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (120 µl) was added. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and placed on ice, and 1.2 ml of Buffer A (0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The solution was mixed continuously at 4°C for 6 h and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min, and the supernatant was removed. Three microliters of Kv1.3 antisera (made to the COOH-terminal epitope, EELRKARSNSTLSKSE) were added to the supernatant and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Protein A Affi-Gel beads (15 µl) were added, and the suspension was mixed continuously at 4°C overnight. The beads were centrifuged, and the supernatant was re-immunoprecipitated. Beads were washed 3 times with Buffer A and 2 times with 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0) prior to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. To determine whether there are additional sites besides T1 in Kv1.3 that provide intersubunit interactions sufficient for channel formation, we have made a mutant lacking the first 141 amino acids, and therefore the T1 domain, of the NH2 terminus. This mutant is referred to as Kv1.3 (T1−). As shown in Fig. 1A, both Kv1.3 and Kv1.3 (T1−) can be translated in vitro. They were glycosylated (Fig. 1B) in the presence of microsomal membranes (+m, lanes 2 and 3). The upper band in each lane 2 represents glycosylated protein as shown by endoglycosidase digestion (+E, lanes 3). We injected the cRNA for this mutant into Xenopus oocytes and recorded the current elicited 24-48 h later using a two-electrode voltage clamp. Fig. 2 shows these currents along with those recorded from oocytes injected with wild-type Kv1.3. The central tendency and dispersion of the data in Fig. 2A, expressed in microamperes, are represented as box plots. Kv1.3 (T1−) forms channels with electrophysiological characteristics similar to those of wild-type Kv1.3. The activation and inactivation time constants at +50 mV were 5.63 ± 0.13 and 966 ± 53 ms (n = 4, ± S.E.), respectively, for wild-type Kv1.3 and 6.07 ± 0.58 and 880 ± 23 ms (n = 4), respectively, for Kv1.3 (T1−). The level of current expressed, however, is lower (~50%) for Kv1.3 (T1−) channels. Because functional K+ channels assemble in the absence of a T1 domain, these results suggest that there are sites in the central core and perhaps the COOH terminus of Kv1.3 (T1−) that provide additional, and distinctly different, intersubunit interactions for channel formation.Fig. 2Expression of full-length Kv1.3 and Kv1.3 (T1−) in oocytes. Xenopus oocytes were injected with cRNA for full-length Kv1.3 or Kv1.3 (T1−) and recordings were made 44 h postinjection. A, peak current at +50 mV was measured. Data are represented as box plots, where the horizontal line in the box is the median value (n = 4 for Kv1.3; n = 5 for Kv1.3 (T1−)). B, current was elicited from oocytes injected with Kv1.3 or Kv1.3 (T1−) by steps from a holding potential of −100 mV to voltages between −40 and +40 mV in 20-mV increments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the lower level of Kv1.3 (T1−) expression were due to fewer stabilization interactions between subunits, then this would predict that Kv1.3 (T1−) tetramerization might shift toward a monomeric state. This appears to be the case for Kv1.3 proteins translated in vitro and analyzed by sucrose gradient fractional migration (11Tu L. Sheng Z.F. Panyi G. Santarelli V. Pain D. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Which transmembrane and loop segments comprise the sites of intersubunit interactions in channel assembly? To address this question, we tested the ability of a series of Kv1.3 segments to suppress the current of co-expressed Kv1.3 (T1−) channels. The constructs are shown in Fig. 3. RNA made from these constructs translated well in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with microsomal membranes to give proteins at the appropriate molecular weights (Fig. 4). An N-linked glycosylation site in the loop between S1 and S2 is present and glycosylated in S1-S2, S1-S2-S3, and S2-COOH. Each of these peptide fragments migrates as two bands, the 2-kDa higher band corresponding to a glycosylated peptide (i.e. endoglycosidase-sensitive, data not shown). Based on protease protection assays (data not shown) and N-linked glycosylation for all peptide fragments shown in Fig. 4, the COOH terminus, when present, is located in the cytosol, i.e. the native orientation, and S2-COOH is properly glycosylated (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). This confirms that S2 functions to initiate translocation of NH2-terminal flanking sequences (e.g. signal sequence activity).Fig. 4In vitro translation of truncated Kv1.3 (T1−) constructs. Fluorographs of [35S]methionine-labeled peptides translated in vitro from the constructs listed in Fig. 3. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreatic microsomal membranes were used for the in vitro translation according to Promega protocols.

A, time course of degradation of Kv1.3 (T1−), S2-COOH, and S5-COOH. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of a mixture of Kv1.3 (T1−) cRNA and [35S]methionine/cysteine (10× concentration; Tran35S-label, ICN, 20 µCi/µl; 0.9 methionine, 0.1 cysteine). Following incubation in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 18°C for 4 h in methionine cysteine-free medium, the medium was changed to a 1 mM methionine, 1 mM cysteine medium, and oocytes were frozen (−80°C) at the indicated times. All samples were thawed in homogenization buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”), homogenized and immunoprecipitated using Kv1.3 antisera, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Lanes 1, 6, and 11 show products for Kv1.3 (T1−), S5-COOH, and S2-COOH, respectively, obtained from in vitro translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate with microsomal membranes. Seven oocytes were used for each of lanes 2-5, 7-10, and 12-15. B, time course of degradation of co-expressed Kv1.3 (T1−) and peptide fragments. Co-injections of full-length and truncated Kv1.3 (T1−) cRNA were carried out in a molar ratio of 1:2, respectively, for S5-COOH (lanes 1-4) and S2-COOH (lanes 5-8) as described in A. Inset, the measured intensities of S5-COOH and S2-COOH bands at each time point were corrected to the equivalent intensities for the number of methionines and cysteines contained in Kv1.3 (T1−). The correction factors for S5-COOH and S2-COOH were 1.29 and 1.01, respectively. Protein mole ratios of S5-COOH:Kv1.3 (T1−) and S2-COOH:Kv1.3 (T1−) were calculated from the relative corrected intensities of peptide fragment to that of Kv1.3 (T1−) at each indicated time. C, for the data shown in B, and for a similar experiment (data not shown), the protein mole equivalents of Kv1.3 (T1−) and each peptide fragment were calculated relative to Kv1.3 (T1−) co-expressed in the presence of S5-COOH at 4 h. The protein mole equivalents were calculated using the corrected intensities (see above legend for Fig. 6B). Two experiments were averaged to give the resulting degradation profiles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Effect of truncated Kv1.3 (T1−) sequences on Kv1.3 (T1−) current expressed in oocytes. Oocytes were co-injected with cRNA for Kv1.3 (T1−) and either CD4 (control), S1, S1-S2-S3, S2-COOH, S3-COOH, or S5-COOH, and recordings were made 48 h postinjection. Peak current at +50 mV was measured. Data are represented as box plots (n = 10 for all but S2-COOH, n = 8, and S5-COOH, n = 9). S1-S2-S3, S2-COOH, and S3-COOH are each significantly less than control, with p < 0.002, as determined from a nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When cRNA encoding Kv1.3 (T1−) was co-injected together with cRNA for each of the fragments shown in Fig. 3, the results shown in Fig. 5 (and Fig. 7) were obtained for expressed Kv1.3 (T1−) current compared with that for Kv1.3 (T1−) co-injected with a CD4 control cRNA. (Co-expression of CD4 cRNA with Kv1.3 (T1−) cRNA does not suppress current (1Tu L. Santarelli V. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). Truncated segments containing S1-S2-S3, S2-COOH, and S3-COOH suppress Kv1.3 (T1−) 73, 67, and 84%, respectively (p ≤ 0.001, Mann-Whitney rank sum test) in the experiments of Fig. 5, whereas S5-COOH and S1 do not suppress. It is noteworthy that S5-COOH alone does not produce any current over the voltage range −60 to +50 mV. Nor was any inward current detected at −100 mV (1Tu L. Santarelli V. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), despite the formal resemblance of S5-COOH to an inward rectifier (i.e. it has two transmembrane spanning segments and a pore region). To test whether the lack of suppression observed for Kv1.3 (T1−)/S5-COOH or Kv1.3 (T1−)/S1 co-injections could be due to lack of in vivo translation and/or instability of the S5-COOH peptide, we used an anti-Kv1.3 antibody directed to a COOH-terminal epitope to immunoprecipitate expressed protein from microinjected oocytes. Since our antibody only detects chains containing an intact COOH terminus, we determined the relative amounts and stabilities of Kv1.3 (T1−), S2-COOH, and S5-COOH protein in a pulse-chase experiment. Oocytes were injected with cRNA and [35S]methionine/cysteine and labeled for 3 h, chased with unlabeled methionine/cysteine, and sampled over the next 48 h. As shown in Fig. 6A, immunoprecipitation of oocyte homogenates detected proteins at the molecular weights for Kv1.3 (T1−), S2-COOH, and S5-COOH similar to in vitro translation products. Kv1.3 (T1−) was present in all cases (~42 kDa), was glycosylated, and was stable regardless of whether it was expressed alone (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-5), or in the presence of S5-COOH or S2-COOH (Fig. 6B, lanes 1-4 and 5-8, respectively). Comparison of lanes 1-4 with 5-8 in Fig. 6B indicates that S5-COOH (20 kDa) and S2-COOH (two bands ~34 kDa) were present in comparable concentrations. The measured intensities were corrected to the equivalent intensities for the number of methionines and cysteines in Kv1.3 (T1−) (six and four for S5-COOH, nine and six for S2-COOH, nine and seven for Kv1.3 (T1−), respectively), and the protein mole ratios of peptide fragment to Kv1.3 (T1−) calculated for each indicated time (Fig. 6B, inset). The relative mole ratios of S5-COOH and S2-COOH to Kv1.3 (T1−) are similar at each time point, indicating that suppressive versus nonsuppressive effects of these peptide fragments cannot be attributed to differences in their concentration relative to the channel protein. The protein mole equivalents for co-expressed Kv1.3 (T1−) and S2-COOH and for co-expressed Kv1.3 (T1−) and S5-COOH were calculated relative to the 4-h point and normalized to the mole equivalents for Kv1.3 (T1−) expressed in the presence of S5-COOH. These results were averaged with those obtained from a duplicate experiment (data not shown) to give the degradation profile shown in Fig. 6C. In the individual experiments, S2-COOH and S5-COOH were each quite stable, as 50-70% of the initially labeled protein was still present at 48 h, and both peptide fragments degraded at similar rates. These results show that lack of suppression of expressed current by S5-COOH was not due to inadequate translation and/or instability of the peptide fragments, or enhanced degradation of Kv1.3 (T1−) protein. The most straightforward interpretation is that reduction of K+ current by some of the peptide fragments is due to specific suppressive interactions. Since S2-COOH and S3-COOH contain the three transmembrane segments S2-S3-S4 and S3-S4-S5, respectively, we investigated whether multiple contiguous transmembrane segments are required for suppression and, if so, how many. We co-injected Kv1.3 (T1−) with either S1-S2, S2-S3, S3-S4, S2-S3-S4, S3-S4-S5, or S4-COOH and measured the expressed currents. These data are shown in Fig. 7 along with a positive control, S1-S2-S3, which suppresses strongly, and a negative control, S1, which does not suppress. (Median currents for S1 and CD4 co-expressed with Kv1.3 (T1−) were 3.18 and 3.01 µA, respectively, and 3.59 and 4.33 µA, respectively, in two separate experiments). Only S1-S2-S3 and S3-S4-S5 strongly suppressed Kv1.3 (T1−) (p < 0.001) current was reduced 5.6- and 6.7-fold, respectively. S1-S2, S2-S3, S3-S4, S2-S3-S4, and S4-COOH also suppressed Kv1.3 (T1−) current compared with control currents (p < 0.001) but to much lesser extents (i.e., intermediate suppression); current was decreased 2.8-, 2.4-, 2.1-, 2.1-, and 1.8-fold, respectively. These differences between strong and intermediate suppression are significant, as shown by nonparametric statistical analysis (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney rank sum test) and are emphasized in Fig. 7 by the patterned box plots versus the solid boxes (open for nonsuppressors, filled for strong suppressors). We have arbitrarily distributed suppressors into three categories based on strong, intermediate, or absent suppressor activity. Similar results were obtained in additional experiments and are shown in Fig. 8 as a scattergram for each peptide fragment. These findings suggest that 1) two adjacent transmembrane segments are not sufficient to cause strong suppression, 2) three contiguous transmembrane segments containing two odd-numbered segments can cause suppression, and 3) the S3 segment is a critical region common to strongly suppressing Kv1.3 fragments. Are these suppression sites subfamily-specific? To answer this question, we have tested the ability of T1− segments of Kv1.3 to suppress functional expression of NH2-terminal deletion mutants of another K+ channel isoform, Kv2.1. This isoform has only 40% amino acid identity with Kv1.3 and will not form heteromultimers with full-length Shaker-like subunits (2Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Kv2.1 (ΔN139) was made by deleting the first 417 bases encoding the first 139 (out of 190) amino acids of the NH2 terminus. Fig. 9A shows the currents produced in oocytes by this deletion mutant (see also Ref. 12Van Dongen A.M.J. Frech G.C. Drewe J.A. Joho R.H. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9B, co-injection of Kv2.1 (ΔN139) with S1-S2-S3 or S2-COOH from Kv1.3 (T1−) in a cRNA mole ratio of 1:2 strongly inhibits Kv2.1 (ΔN139) (p < 0.001 for each compared with Kv2.1(ΔN139)/CD4 control). The truncated Kv1.3 (T1−) fragments S3-S4-S5 and S3-S4 suppress currents (p < 0.001 for each compared with Kv2.1 (ΔN139)/CD4 control), but not as strongly. There is a 4.5- versus 20-fold decrease for S3-S4-S5 and S1-S2-S3, respectively (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that the suppression sites in the hydrophobic core of the K+ channel are promiscuous across voltage-gated K+ channel subfamilies. Our results show that sites in the central core (S1 through S6-COOH) of Kv1.3 may serve as intersubunit association domains. It is likely that such domains exist across subfamilies (4Lee T.E. Phillipson L.H. Kuznetsov A. Nelson D.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 667-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Van Dongen A.M.J. Frech G.C. Drewe J.A. Joho R.H. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); however, they need not be identically conserved and may contribute differentially to stable channel formation. For example, deletion mutants of AKv1.1a that lack a T1 domain (AKv1.1a (T1−)) do not homotetramerize (3Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), in contrast to our results for Kv1.3 (Fig. 1). We suggest that tetramer stability is conferred, to different extents, by T1 and core association domains for each K+ channel isoform. In some isoforms, T1 provides the strong, critical stabilization interaction permitting tetramer formation (e.g. Kv1.1, Shaker), whereas in other isoforms, the hydrophobic core association domains appear to provide additional stabilization interactions (e.g. Kv2.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5), sufficient to form stable channels in the absence of T1 (1Tu L. Santarelli V. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Lee T.E. Phillipson L.H. Kuznetsov A. Nelson D.J. Biophys.

Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have shown that although AKv1.1a (T1−) proteins do not homotetramerize, they do assemble weakly with subunits that contain T1 domains. They proposed that this weak association could be due to binding of the T1 domain with another part of the subunit or that the T1− protein is somehow stabilized in an otherwise wild-type tetramer. This explanation is consistent with the existence of additional core association domains. Assembly is likely to require multiple subunit interactions between different parts of the protein, any of which might occur in different cellular compartments and at distinctly different times. Disruption of any one of these association interactions may be sufficient to cause suppression. The mechanism of suppression in our experiments is not known. Thus far, our results (Fig. 6) show that translation of truncated peptide fragments neither prevents translation of Kv1.3 (T1−) nor increases its rate of degradation. Other possible mechanisms for suppression include competitive inhibition of tetramer formation by truncated peptide, scavenging of monomers by truncated peptides, or perhaps specific modulation of channel processing by truncated peptides. When the strong suppressor, S1-S2-S3, was co-translated with Kv1.3 (T1−) in vitro it could be co-immunoprecipitated with a COOH terminus Kv1.3 antisera that reacts with Kv1.3 (T1−) (Fig. 10), suggesting that suppression involves direct association of a peptide fragment with Kv1.3 (T1−). Additionally, mechanisms unrelated to assembly may be responsible for suppression, e.g. impaired gating accompanying peptide fragment association with the tetramer. Understanding the mechanism of suppression will be an important step in determining whether suppression sites can be used to identify intersubunit association sites. Not all Kv1.3 fragments suppressed full-length Kv1.3 (T1−) current. We classify these fragments into three categories. The first contains fragments that suppressed by 60-95% in ≥70% of the experiments and includes S1-S2-S3, S3-S4-S5, S2-COOH, and S3-COOH. We refer to these fragments as strong suppressors. The second class contains intermediate suppressing fragments and includes S1-S2, S2-S3, S3-S4, S2-S3-S4, and S4-COOH. These fragments decreased currents by only 12-60% in >50% of the experiments. The last category contains nonsuppressors and includes S1 and S5-COOH. In every experiment, currents were not significantly different from control currents. Our results indicate that strong, consistent suppression requires a minimum of three consecutive transmembrane segments. This requirement is not for the purpose of ensuring integration of the peptide into the membrane since S5-COOH, for example, does integrate into the membrane with correct orientation, 1Z. Sheng, W. Skach, and C. Deutsch, unpublished results. yet does not suppress Kv1.3 (T1−) current. This peptide fragment must lack sufficient specific interaction sites to compete with full-length subunit association. Point mutations in S2 and S3 of Shaker channels appear to disrupt electrostatic interactions between negatively charged residues in S2 and S3 and positively charged residues in S4 (15Planells-Cases R.

J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Electrostatic interactions can occur over distances as large as 10-20 Å (18Gilson M.K. Honig B.H. Proteins. 1988; 3: 32-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Russell A.J. Thomas P.A. Fersht A.R. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 21: 41-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although we have no measurements of intersubunit distances, they may be as short as 8 Å (20Richmond T. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 21Chothia C. Levitt M. Richardson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). If electrostatic interactions occur between subunits, then S2, S3, and S4 are likely candidates for sites of intersubunit association. These segments would thus provide promiscuous recognition and stabilization, since the negatively charged residues in transmembrane segments S2 and S3, as well as many of the positively charged S4 residues believed to comprise the voltage sensor, are conserved across all four subfamilies of voltage-gated K+ channels. Moreover, the folding and/or membrane integration of peptide fragments that contain such charged amino acids might also be influenced by intrapeptide electrostatic interactions. The strongly suppressing fragments, S1-S2-S3 and S2-COOH, and some intermediate suppressing fragments derived from Kv1.3 are also capable of suppressing currents produced by the Shab-like mutant channel protein, Kv2.1 (ΔN139), indicating that some suppression sites are conserved across K+ channel subfamilies and may serve as promiscuous association domains. More specific intrasubfamily interactions appear to be conferred by subfamily-specific T1 domains (1Tu L. Santarelli V. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 6Xu J. Yu W. Jan J.N.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These T1 domains may, in fact, function as deterrents to assembly of heteromultimers across subfamilies resulting from conserved association sites, consistent with the observations of Lee et al. (4Lee T.E. Phillipson L.H. Kuznetsov A. Nelson D.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 667-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that NH2-terminal deletion mutants of hKv1.4 (Δ28-283) and Kv2.1 (ΔN139) form heteromultimers.

Previous genetic studies led to the suggestion that SacT and SacY function as nascent mRNA binding proteins preventing early termination of transcription at terminators located in the leader regions of the corresponding genes. Here we report the overproduction, purification to near homogeneity, and characterization of the two antiterminators, SacT and SacY. Using mRNA band migration retardation assays and a reconstituted transcriptional antitermination system, the mRNA binding functions and antitermination activities of purified SacT and SacY are demonstrated under in vitro conditions. The results establish for the first time that members of the BglG family of antiterminators function in antitermination in the absence of other proteins in vitro. Purified SacT is shown to be phosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate in a phosphotransferase-catalyzed reaction dependent on Enzyme I and HPr.

Unexpectedly, the purified SacT is shown to be functional in mRNA binding and in transcriptional antitermination independently of its phosphorylation state. Gene expression is generally regulated at two different levels, control of transcriptional initiation and control of transcriptional termination. In bacteria, termination-antitermination controls viral development (Ptashne, 23Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch: Phage λ and Higher Organisms. Cell Press, Cambridge, MA1992: 50Google Scholar), amino acid biosynthesis (Babitzke et al., 7Babitzke P. Bear D.G. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1993; 51: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, RNA-protein interactions are proving important for numerous biological processes such as intron splicing, enzyme catalysis, and protein synthesis and secretion (Belfort et al., 9Belfort M. Reaban M.E. Coetzee T. Dalgaard J.Z. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3897-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Wiedmann et al., 36Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M.

Induction of the sac (sucrose utilization) genes of Bacillus subtilis and the bgl (β-glucoside utilization) operon of Escherichia coli is controlled by transcriptional antitermination (Crutz et al., 10Crutz A-M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. Richter R. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Débarbouillé et al., 11Débarbouillé M. Arnaud M. Fouet A. Klier A. Rapoport G. J.

Within the B. subtilis sac system is the sacB gene encoding levansucrase and the sacPA operon encoding the sucrose permease and a phosphosucrase. In these systems, transcription is initiated at constitutive promoters, and expression is regulated by controlled read-through at transcriptional terminators located between the promoters and the first structural genes of the operons. Gene-specific antiterminators are required to prevent early transcriptional termination. Three genes within the bgl operon of E. coli, bglG, bglF, and bglB, are involved in aromatic β-glucoside utilization (Schnetz et al., 32Schnetz K. Toloczyki C. Rak B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2579-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Schnetz and Rak, 30Schnetz K. Rak B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3271-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). BglG is a positive regulator that recognizes a specific RNA sequence located upstream of the terminator of the bgl operon. Binding of BglG to a specific secondary structural element on the bgl mRNA prevents transcriptional termination by blocking the formation of a terminator (Houman et al., 18Houman F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Wright A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). BglF, the β-glucoside permease, is an Enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) 1The abbreviations used are: PTSphosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase systemPEPphosphoenolpyruvate. with a IIBCA domain structure (Saier and Reizer, 28Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also functions as a negative transcriptional regulator, controlling the activity of BglG by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation in response to the external level of inducer. The degree of phosphorylation of BglG in vivo is believed to be dependent on the cellular concentration of BglF which serves as the direct phosphoryl donor and acceptor in the antiterminator kinase- and phosphatase-catalyzed reactions. The antiterminator is active in the nonphosphorylated state because this form of the protein exhibits a dimeric structure while the phosphorylated form is monomeric and therefore inactive (Amster-Choder et al., 3Amster-Choder O. Houman F. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar; Amster-Choder and Wright, 1Amster-Choder O. Wright A.

In B. subtilis two regulatory genes, sacT and sacY, encode proteins that respectively control transcription of the sacPA and sacB genes. Their protein products are homologous to BglG and apparently function by an analogous antitermination mechanism (Houman et al., 18Houman F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Wright A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar; Débarbouillé et al., 11Débarbouillé M. Arnaud M. Fouet A. Klier A. Rapoport G. J.

A. 1992; 89: 10410-10414Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The PTS has been shown to regulate both the sacPA and sacB genes in vivo, and unphosphorylated SacY appears to be responsible for high level expression of these genes in mutants lacking Enzyme I (pstI) or HPr (ptsH). Conversely, in ptsH and ptsI mutants, SacT is nonfunctional, indicating that phosphorylation is required for its activity (Arnaud et al., 4Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Débarbouillé M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, we have postulated that SacT may possess two phosphorylation sites (Arnaud et al., 4Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Débarbouillé M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPr, the second phosphocarrier protein of the PTS, is phosphorylated by Enzyme I, and HPr(His~P) possibly phosphorylates the antiterminator SacT on one site as a prerequisite for its activity. Then, if SacT is phosphorylated at a second site in the absence of sucrose, inactivation may result as proposed for BglG and SacY (Schnetz and Rak, 31Schnetz K. Rak B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5074-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; Amster-Choder et al., 3Amster-Choder O. Houman F. Wright A.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This second phosphorylation event would depend on the presence of an as yet unidentified sucrose sensor protein, functionally similar to the sucrose-specific permease of the PTS. In the presence of sucrose, only this second site in SacT would become dephosphorylated, and SacT would thereby be activated when sucrose is translocated into the cell. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed (Arnaud et al., 4Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Débarbouillé M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several transcriptional regulatory proteins homologous to BglG, SacT, and SacY have been identified. These proteins include AbgG of Clostridium longisporum (GenBank™ accession number L49336), BglR of Lactococcus lactis (Bardowski, 8Bardowski J. Ehrlich S.D. Chopin A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5681-5685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LicT from B. subtilis (Schnetz et al., 33Schnetz K. Stülke J. Gertz S. Krüger S. Krieg M. Hecker M. Rak B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ArbG from Erwinia chrysanthemi (El Hassouni et al., 13Hassouni M. Henrissat B. Chippaux M. Barras F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 765-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the multidomain proteins of B. subtilis, CelR (SWISSPROT identifier P46321), and LevR (Débarbouillé et al., 12Débarbouillé M. Martin-Verstraete I. Klier A. Rapoport G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2212-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which each contains a BglG/SacT-like module. LevR, like BglG of E. coli, has been shown to be phosphorylated by PEP in a PTS-catalyzed reaction (Stülke et al., 34Stülke J. Martin-Verstraete I. Charrier V. Klier A. Deutscher J. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6928-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, none of these proteins has been purified and used in in vitro experiments to demonstrate its antitermination activity. In this report we describe the overproduction, purification, and characterization of SacT and SacY. We show that purified SacT and SacY bind to a specific sacPA mRNA sequence, and we describe a reconstituted SacY- or SacT-dependent transcriptional antitermination system which is functional in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that SacT is phosphorylated by PEP in a process that depends only on Enzyme I and HPr as previously deduced from genetic studies. Altogether, the data presented herein serve to establish that both SacT and SacY serve as transcriptional antiterminators in the absence of auxiliary proteins. Intermediate stages of plasmid cloning and routine plasmid DNA propagation were carried out in E. coli strains TG1 (F′ traD36 lacIq Δ(lacZ)M15 proA+B+/supEΔ(hsdM-mcrB)5(r−kmk−McrB−) thi Δ(lac-proAB) or BL21 (F− ompT hsdSB(r−Bm−B) gal dcm) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Overexpression of the B. subtilis genes sacT, sacY, ptsI, and ptsH was performed in E. coli strains MZ1 (Zuber et al., 37Zuber M. Patterson T.A. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or BL21(DE3) (Novagen) as described below. All E. coli strains were routinely grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing ampicillin (50 µg/ml) when appropriate. Site-directed mutagenesis and introduction of restriction sites in the sacT gene was performed using the Muta-gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The oligonucleotide 5′-CTT TAT AGA TTT TGT TAT-3′ was used to introduce an NdeI site (underlined) in the initiation codon of sacT, and the oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-CGT TAC GGT TAT-3′ was used to introduce an NdeI site (underlined) in the initiation codon of sacT, and the oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-CGT TAC GAA TCT GAC AA TCT GAC ATT-3′ was used to introduce SalI and SmaI sites downstream of the translational stop codon of sacT. The modified sacT gene was then cloned between the NdeI and SalI sites of the overexpression vector pRE-1 (Reddy et al., 24Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to generate pRE1-T1, and between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET19b (Novagen) to generate pET19b-T1. Site-directed mutagenesis of sacY was performed essentially as described previously (Sutrina et al., 35Sutrina S.L. Reddy P. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18581-18589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after cloning the ClaI-NruI fragment (~1560 base pairs) of pMF20 (Arnaud et al., 4Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Débarbouillé M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between the ClaI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-GGG GGA TGA AAG GAC AAA AAA AAA ATT AAA-3′ was used to introduce an NdeI site in the initiation codon of the sacY gene, and the modified gene was then cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pRE-1 and pET19b to generate plasmids pRE1-Y1 and pET19b-Y1, respectively. Plasmid pPA2 was constructed as follows: an AccI-SspI fragment located upstream of the sacPA operon and containing the sacPA promoter, the palindromic terminator structure, and 19 codons of sacP was first isolated from plasmid pTP7 (Débarbouillé et al., 11Débarbouillé M. Arnaud M. Fouet A. Klier A. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned between the AccI and SmaI sites of pAM18 (paired promoter T7 system, Amersham Corp.). Plasmid pPA3, similar to pPA2, was obtained by cloning the XmnI-Sau3A fragment containing the same promoter and the upstream half of the terminator between the SmaI and BamHI sites of pAM19. The XmnI-Sau3A DNA fragment was isolated from plasmid pBSG8-34. In this plasmid, the original Sau3A restriction site was replaced by a BamHI site (Arnaud et al., 4Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Débarbouillé M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously described growth conditions of E. coli MZ1 containing the appropriate pRE1 derived overexpression vector were used to overproduce SacT, SacY, the PTS proteins, Enzyme I and HPr, and the IIAGlc protein domain of B. subtilis (Reizer et al., 26Reizer J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18581-18589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For overproduction of SacT and SacY in E. coli BL21(DE3) bearing the overexpression vector pET19b-T1 or pET19b-Y1, 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added at A600 of 0.4-0.7 to cultures grown in LB medium (at 37°C), and incubation was then continued for an additional 3 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10% glycerol (TPG buffer), and ruptured by two passages through an Aminco French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. Initial attempts to purify SacT and SacY from E. coli MZ1 containing pRE1-T1 or pRE1-Y1, respectively, resulted in precipitation of the partially purified antiterminators. Precipitation usually occurred during or after concentration by ultrafiltration (YM10, Amicon, Inc.) of the protein preparations that had been partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a DEAE-Sephacel column (see below). Because a similar concentrating step was not required during purification of the two antiterminators from extracts of E. coli BL21(DE3) bearing the pET19b-derived plasmids, subsequent purification of these proteins was carried out following overproduction of SacT and SacY in E. coli BL21(DE3) bearing pET19b-T1 and pET19b-Y1, respectively. The following purification protocol was applied to both SacT and SacY. A crude extract derived from cells grown in 6-8 liters of culture medium was loaded onto a column of DEAE-Sephacel (200 ml bed volume) which had been pre-equilibrated with TPG buffer. The column was washed with 600 ml of the same buffer, and proteins were then eluted with a linear salt concentration gradient (2000 ml of 0-1 M NaCl) in TPG buffer. Fractions (15 ml) were collected and assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the presence of SacT or SacY which eluted as a broad peak at about 0.35-1 M NaCl. Fractions containing His-tagged SacT or His-tagged SacY were pooled and loaded onto an immobilized Ni2+ column (His-Bind resin, Novagen) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM imidazole. The column was washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 60 mM imidazole, and the His-tagged antiterminator was eluted with the same buffer with the imidazole concentration increased to 1 M. The purified proteins were then dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.5 M NaCl and stored at −70°C until used. Enzyme I, HPr, and the recombinant IIAGlc protein domain of the B. subtilis Enzyme IIGlc were overproduced and purified as described previously (Reizer et al., 26Reizer J. Sutrina S.L.

The two plasmids, pPA2 and pPA3, which contain the sacPA promoter region (see Fig. 3), were used as templates for RNA probe synthesis. The plasmids were linearized with EcoRI or HindIII, respectively, and extracted with phenol before conducting in vitro RNA synthesis experiments. RNA synthesis was performed using the paired promoter T7 system kit (Amersham Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transcription mixtures used for probe synthesis contained 100 µCi of α-[33P]UTP and 12.5 µM UTP. The RNA probes were purified after migration on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 25 µg/ml yeast tRNA. Assay mixtures for the PTS-dependent phosphorylation of SacT contained, unless otherwise indicated, 4 µg of SacT, 2 µg of HPr, 1.6 µg of Enzyme I, and 12.5 mM PEP in a final volume of 20 µl of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, containing 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM dithiothreitol). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37°C and transferred to an ice bath. They were used within a few minutes for binding assays. The RNA transcripts (104 cpm/assay in 4 µl of binding buffer) with 1 unit of human placenta RNase inhibitor) were incubated at 80°C for 3 min and transferred to an ice bath. The native or phosphorylated SacT or SacY (in 10 µl of phosphorylation reaction mixture) was mixed with the RNA probes at 4°C, incubated at 16°C for 10 min, and finally incubated at 0°C for 10 min. Glass-distilled glycerol (final concentration 10%, Eastman Kodak Co.) was added before loading the samples onto an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with a cross-linking ratio of 29:1 in 0.375 M Tris buffer (pH 8.8). Prior to loading, the gels were chilled for 1 h and prerun (300 V) for 1 h at 4°C. Electrophoresis for 2 h at 4°C was carried out at 300 V using 0.025 M Tris-HCl containing 0.2 M glycine as running buffer. Transcription was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 nM template DNA, 0.2 µM RNA polymerase holoenzyme of E. coli or B. subtilis, 200 µM GTP, CTP, and ATP, 50 µM UTP, and 5 µCi of α-[32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 30 µl. Assay mixtures were then incubated at 65°C for 10 min and loaded onto a 7% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (Sanger and Coulson, 29Sanger F. Coulson A.R. FEBS Lett. 1978; 87: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in bands was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was performed with a Pharmacia Phast System or as described before (Reizer et al., 27Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Wu L.-F. Deutscher J. Reddy P. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9158-9169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [32P]PEP was prepared by the method of Matoo and Waygood (21Mattoo R.L. Waygood E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Proteins labeled with [32P]PEP were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography as described previously (Reizer et al., 26Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the Lowry method (Lowry et al., 20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, the overproduced SacY or SacT represents the major protein band in an extract of E. coli BL21(DE3) bearing pET19b-Y1 or pET19b-T1, respectively. Following a two-step purification protocol that consisted of (a) ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column and (b) affinity chromatography of the His-tagged proteins on a His-Bind metal (e.g. Ni2+) chelation resin (see “Experimental Procedures”) nearly electrophoretically pure preparations of SacT and SacY were obtained (Fig. 1A). The single faint band that migrated faster than SacT or SacY is most likely a proteolytic product of the major protein band, since its mobility relative to SacT remained unchanged under modified polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B), and it was phosphorylated by the PTS as was SacT (see below). The purified SacY migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a band with an apparent molecular mass of ~34,000 Da, in agreement with the molecular mass of 32,465 Da calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein. Interestingly, purified SacT migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a band with an apparent molecular mass of ~30,000 Da, although the molecular mass of SacT calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence (32,074 Da) is similar to that of SacY. One additional prominent band, corresponding to the homodimeric form of SacT (~68,000 Da), was detected in SDS-polyacrylamide gels if the purified SacT protein was not boiled before loading the gels and the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the sample buffer (Fig. 1B). At increasing concentrations of dithiothreitol (1-10 mM) in the sample buffer the amounts of monomeric SacT gradually increased at the expense of its homodimeric form (Fig. 1B). These findings provide evidence for a dimeric SacT. An autoradiogram showing the phosphorylation of SacT by purified Enzyme I and HPr in the presence of [32P]PEP is shown in Fig. 2. In lane 1, the purified Enzyme I, HPr, and IIAGlc of B. subtilis were incubated with [32P]PEP, and only these three proteins were labeled. In lane 2, Enzyme I and SacT were incubated with [32P]PEP, and only the former protein was labeled. By contrast, SacT was readily phosphorylated when incubated in the presence of Enzyme I, HPr, and [32P]PEP (lane 3). As expected for a histidyl or cysteyl phosphorylated protein, the 32P-labeled SacT was labile under acidic conditions but stable under alkaline conditions (data not shown). These observations establish that SacT can serve as a phosphoryl acceptor with the general energy-coupling protein, HPr(His~P) serving as the phosphoryl donor. Although the phosphorylation of SacT by HPr(His~P) is in agreement with previously published genetic data, we do not ignore the possibility that an additional site in SacT may be phosphorylated by an unidentified sucrose-sensor protein of the PTS (Arnaud et al., 4Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Débarbouillé M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of BglG to bgl mRNA has been studied by transferring protein extracts containing the unphosphorylated form of BglG onto a membrane and probing with mRNA transcripts. These experiments led to the conclusion that BglG dimers bind to a specific mRNA sequence (Houman et al., 18Houman F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Wright A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similar mRNA sequences referred to as ribonucleic antiterminator sequences were identified as SacT and SacY binding sites (Aymerich and Steinmetz, 6Aymerich S. Steinmetz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10410-10414Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Ribonucleoprotein complexes can be visualized on the basis of their altered mobility during gel electrophoresis compared to that of the corresponding nucleic acid alone. The binding of SacT to RNA was studied using this procedure. Since we previously showed that SacT needs the general components of the PTS for its activity in vivo (Arnaud et al., 4Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Débarbouillé M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purified SacT was phosphorylated first with PEP in the presence of Enzyme I and HPr and then incubated with an RNA probe containing the promoter and terminator region upstream of sacPA (probe 1, Fig. 3). Employing electrophoresis in native polyacrylamide gels, no RNA-protein complex was detected under these conditions. Similar results were obtained with probe 2, which contains the upstream half of the terminator. These results may have been due to formation of the stem-loop structure that interferes with the binding of SacT as has been previously proposed for BglG (Houman et al., 18Houman F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Wright A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Indeed, the formation of mRNA-SacT complexes was observed after heat denaturation of the probes at 80°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 1-5), two distinct mRNA-protein complexes were clearly detected when a high concentration of SacT was incubated with probe 1. An mRNA-protein complex was also observed with probe 2 (lanes 6-10), and heat denaturation of the probe was similarly required as had been observed with full-length probe 1. Competition experiments were then carried out by addition of unlabeled RNA probe 2 to a binding assay mixture containing the same radiolabeled probe. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 10-15), when the concentration of the unlabeled competitor was increased, the labeled probe was released progressively from the RNA-protein complex. The same experiment was carried out with unlabeled probe 1 leading to the release of the corresponding labeled probe 1 (data not shown). In order to test whether the in vitro phosphorylation of SacT was required for RNA binding, gel shift experiments were performed using the native SacT. Results presented in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 demonstrate that both the native and the phosphorylated SacT can bind both probes.Fig. 5Binding of the unphosphorylated SacT to RNA probe 1 or RNA probe 2.

In this work, we analyzed the role of the C terminus domain of the IL-8 receptor on the signal transduction and receptor internalization mechanisms. The IL-8 receptor A was tagged with an epitope corresponding to the monoclonal antibody 1D4 to monitor the localization of the IL-8 receptor. We demonstrated IL-8-dependent receptor internalization by monitoring the density of surface 125I-labeled IL-8 binding sites and by immunofluorescence microscopy. Truncation of the last 27 amino acids of the IL-8 receptor A severely impaired the IL-8-induced internalization of the receptor. Of importance was the observation that binding of IL-8 to receptors A and B triggered a dramatically faster rate of internalization of receptor B than receptor A, suggesting that the heterologous C termini among receptor subtypes modulate the rate of internalization of IL-8 receptors. However, substitution of the C terminus of the receptor subtype A for the C terminus of receptor B reduced the internalization rate of receptor A. Furthermore, we found that the rate of internalization of IL-8 receptor B triggered by IL-8 was faster than the one induced by the IL-8-related peptide, melanoma growth stimulatory activity. Studies with human neutrophils pretreated with 100 nM IL-8 for 5 min revealed a positive and a negative calcium response mediated by receptors A and B, respectively. In contrast, neutrophils pretreated with melanoma growth stimulatory activity showed positive calcium responses to both receptors A and B.

Zachariae C.O. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Google Scholar). Two IL-8 receptor subtypes, designated as type A and B, have been identified in human and rabbit neutrophils (Holmes et al., 9Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Google Scholar; LaRosa et al., 11LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.T. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol.

LaRosa G.J. Folco E. Wilkinson N. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12391-12394Google Scholar). These receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. IL-8 receptor subtype A binds with high affinity to IL-8 and with low affinity to structurally related peptides MGSA (melanoma growth stimulating activity) and NAP-2 (neutrophil activating peptide-2) (Lee et al., 13Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Google Scholar; LaRosa et al., 11LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.T. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-8 receptor B binds with high affinity to IL-8 and MGSA and moderate affinity to NAP-2 (LaRosa et al., 11LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.T. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Google Scholar; Lee et al., 13Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Google Scholar). Termination of neutrophil responses at the site of injury is thought to be a key step in the regulation of the inflammatory process. The mechanisms of termination of receptor signals mediated by IL-8 are unknown. Studies with other G-protein-coupled receptors have suggested that agonist binding to receptors triggers multiple structural and temporal changes of the receptor, leading to the generation of activation signals and termination signals for the phosphorylation, down-regulation, and internalization of receptors (Sibley et al., 20Sibley D.R. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 913-922Google Scholar). Several reports have also suggested that these signals are generated via independent pathways. For example, substitution of phosphorylated residues of α2a-adrenergic receptor by Ala abolished desensitization without affecting internalization of the receptor (Eason et al., 6Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that different internalization pathways operate in various G-protein coupled receptors. Thus, C termini domains are involved in internalization of angiotensin II receptor (Thomas et al., 23Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Google Scholar), β2-adrenergic receptors (Liggett et al., 14Liggett S.B. Freedman N.J. Schwinn D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 151-156Google Scholar) and α1B-adrenergic receptors (Lattion et al., 12Lattion A.-L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Google Scholar), whereas the third intracellular loop regulates the internalization of muscarinic receptors (Pals-Rylaarsdam et al., 17Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Google Scholar). The role of internalization in several G-protein-coupled receptors is unclear. Although internalization of the receptor into an intracellular compartment appears to play a role in the resensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptors (Barak et al., 1Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Google Scholar). The role of the C terminus in signaling and regulation of neutrophil chemoattractant receptors is unknown. Although recently Ben-Baruch et al. (2Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Biragyn A. Johnston J.J. Wang J.M. Kim J. Chuntharapai A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9121-9128Google Scholar) has shown that truncation of the distal C terminus of the IL-8 receptor B does not affect the IL-8-dependent chemotaxis in transfected CHO cells. In this study, we characterize the internalization profile of the IL-8 receptor subtypes, the role of the C-terminal tail in internalization, and the potential role of internalization of IL-8 receptors in regulating the IL-8-dependent neutrophil responses. interleukin 8 melanocyte growth stimulatory activity neutrophil-activating peptide 2 rabbit IL-8 receptor A monoclonal antibody Chinese hamster ovary cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline. Oligonucleotides were made using an automated DNA synthesizer (model 373A, Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). Taq polymerase was from Promega (Madison, WI). Deep Vent Polymerase and restriction enzymes were obtained from Dupont NEN. Mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO.K1) cells (CCL 61) were from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). G418 was purchased from Sigma. IL-8, MGSA, and NAP-2 were a gift from Repligen Corp. (Cambridge, MA). myo-[2-3H]Inositol (10-20 Ci/mmol) and Na[125I] were purchased from DuPont NEN. Mab 1D4 was a generous gift by Dr. Dan Oprian, Brandeis University, MA. The cDNAs encoding for the human and rabbit IL-8 receptors, types A and B, were subcloned into the pRc/CMV mammalian expression vector. F3RTag cDNA, encoding the rabbit IL-8 receptor A containing the 8-amino acid epitope for Mab 1D4 at the C terminus, was synthesized by PCR using the sense oligonucleotide, 5′-GAT ATC GAA TTC AAG CTT ACT GTG GCC GTA ATG GAA GTA AAC-3′ (primer A) and the antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-GAT ATC GAA TTC TCT AGA TTA TGC AGG TGC CAC CTG AGA GGT TTC GAG ATT TGA AGG CAC GTT GGT-3′ (primer B). The sense oligonucleotide contained a HindIII site, whereas the antisense oligonucleotide contained a XbaI site and a sequence encoding the epitope for the Mab 1D4 (ETSQVAPA) (Mackenzie, 15MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Google Scholar). The PCR product (F3RTag) was digested with HindIII and XbaI and ligated to pRc/CMV. The tag sequence and the fidelity of the cloned PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The F3RDel cDNA, encoding the rabbit IL-8 receptor A with 27 amino acids truncated at its C terminus, was synthesized by PCR using primer A and an antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-GAT ATC GAA TTC TCT AGA TTA TGC AGG TGC CAC CTG AGA GGT TTC GCG GGC CGC AAG CAT CTT-3′ (primer C). Primer C was designed to contain a XbaI site, a nucleotide sequence encoding the Mab 1D4, and six amino acids from Arg-327 to Lys-322. The PCR product (F3RDel) was digested with HindIII/XbaI and ligated to pRc/CMV. To construct the chimeric receptor, the 121-base pair PvuII/XbaI of 5B1a (rabbit IL-8 receptor B) encoding the last 39 amino acids was excised from pRC/CMV-5B1a and subcloned into the PvuII/XbaI-digested pRC/CMV-F3R (rabbit IL-8 receptor A) backbone. The fidelity of the chimeric receptor was confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHO cells were transfected with cDNA constructs using TransfectACE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected CHO cells were selected in the presence of 500 µg/ml G418 and by 125I-labeled IL-8 binding. 125I-Labeled IL-8 radioligand binding assays were performed as described (Suzuki et al., 21Suzuki H. Prado G.N. Wilkinson N. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18263-18266Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and incubated with 5 µCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 16 to 24 h in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After labeling, cells were washed and detached with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3 mM EDTA. Cells were pelleted and resuspended at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.9 mM CaCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and 20 mM LiCl. Cells were stimulated with 100 nM IL-8 for 10 and 30 min. Incubations were terminated by removing medium and adding three volumes of chloroform/methanol. Extraction of total inositol phosphates on Dowex AG1-X8 formate form resin was performed as described (Blount and Krause, 3Blount P. Krause J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16388-16395Google Scholar). Cells were detached, pelleted, and resuspended in a physiological buffer solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgS04, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM Na2HP04, 5 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were loaded with 5 µM Indo-1AM for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml with buffer solution. Cells were stimulated with 100 nM IL-8, and fluorescence intensity was measured at 37°C using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm (Grynkiewicz et al., 8Grynkiewicz G. Peonie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). For studies of calcium responses in neutrophils, blood was drawn from healthy human donors and layered in a Mono-Poly Resolving Medium (ICN Biomedical, Inc., Aurora, Ohio). Neutrophils were isolated in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions, then suspended in physiological buffer solution at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml and loaded with 5 µM Indo-1AM for 30 min at room temperature. Neutrophils were pretreated with 100 nM IL-8 or 100 nM MGSA at 37°C for 5 min, washed with ice-cold physiological buffer, and pelleted at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were incubated at 37°C at the indicated time points and then tested for agonist-dependent intracellular calcium rise. MGSA and IL-8 were added sequentially to the cuvette containing neutrophils to assess the responses mediated by IL-8 receptors B and A, respectively. Immunofluorescent staining of IL-8 receptors in permeabilized CHO cells was carried out as described by Papkoff et al. (18Papkoff J. Nigg E.A. Hunter T. Cell. 1983; 33: 161-172Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cells were grown on microscope slides for 24 h. Cells were then incubated at 37°C in the presence or absence of IL-8 for various times. Cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in the presence of 2% sucrose and permeabilized with an ice-cold solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.3 M sucrose, 0.003 M MgCl2, 0.05 M NaCl, and 0.01 M HEPES (pH 7.4) in PBS for 5 min. Permeabilized cells were incubated with 50 µg/ml of monoclonal antibody (ID4) for 30 min. Antibody binding was detected by the addition of a 1:20 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim). Fluorescence was analyzed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope with epi-illumination. Images were detected using a Canon camera and an ASA 400 Kodak film. Stably transfected CHO cells were incubated for various times with 100 nM of IL-8 at 37°C. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, to remove unbound IL-8. To strip surface-bound IL-8, cells were treated with 0.2 M acetic acid (pH 3.0) containing 0.5 M NaCl for 5 min at 4°C. The number of binding sites was then determined by incubating the cells at 4°C for 2 h with 1 nM125I-labeled IL-8 either alone (total binding) or in the presence of 100 nM IL-8 (nonspecific binding). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with 0.2% SDS. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined in a γ counter. Data were expressed as the percentage of specific binding in the absence of IL-8 pretreatment. An 8-amino acid epitope (tag) corresponding to the Mab 1D4 was fused to the C-terminal end of receptor A to monitor the localization of the IL-8 receptors. As shown in Fig. 1a, the tagged receptor exhibited a similar binding profile as the wild-type receptor. As expected for IL-8 receptor A, high affinity binding to IL-8 and very little binding to the structurally related peptide MGSA and NAP-2 were demonstrated. Most importantly, the activation of the tagged receptor was similar to the wild-type receptor, as shown by the IL-8-dependent inositol phosphate formation or IL-8-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+ assays (Fig. 1, b and c). These data indicate that the epitope tag fused at the C terminus of the receptor did not affect the binding site for IL-8 or the mechanism for receptor activation. These results are in agreement with previous studies indicating that fusion of epitope tags to the C-terminal end of the IL-8 receptor did not affect the binding to IL-8 (Gayle et al., 7Gayle III, R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Nelson N. Bos T.V. Beckmann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7283-7289Google Scholar). Agonist binding to the IL-8 receptor A at 37°C reduced, in a time-dependent fashion, the number of surface 125I-labeled IL-8 binding sites in CHO cells expressing the wild-type and the tagged receptor A (Fig. 2a). No major difference was observed in the time course of receptor sequestration among the wild-type and tagged receptors. These results have suggested that agonist binding triggers receptor internalization. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we determined the localization of the tagged IL-8 receptor A expressed in CHO cells pretreated with and without IL-8. As shown in Fig. 2b, untransfected CHO cells exhibited background fluorescence. CHO cells expressing the tagged IL-8 receptor showed fluorescence on the cell surface. On the other hand, cells expressing the tagged receptors pretreated with IL-8 exhibited fluorescence in the perinuclear region of the cell and low fluorescence in the cell surface. These findings indicate that the loss of surface 125I-labeled IL-8 binding reflects receptor internalization. The C terminus domain of various G-protein-coupled receptors have been implicated in the mechanisms of G-protein activation, receptor desensitization, and internalization (Dohlman et al., 5Dohlman H.G. Thoner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-680Google Scholar). To examine the role of the C terminus of the IL-8 receptor, CHO cells were transfected with a cDNA construct encoding the rabbit IL-8 receptor A deleted of its last 27 amino acids. All potential phosphorylation sites (Ser and Thr) at the C terminus were removed in the truncated receptor. CHO cells expressing the truncated receptor exhibited a binding profile similar to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3a), showing that truncation of the last 27 amino acids did not affect the binding domain of the IL-8 receptor. The IL-8-dependent inositol phosphate production and the IL-8-dependent calcium rise were similar in both the wild-type and the mutant receptor (Fig. 3, b and c), indicating that the mechanisms of receptor activation were unaffected by deletion of the last 27 amino acids of the IL-8 receptor A. These data are consistent with recent findings indicating that deletion of the distal region of the C terminus of the IL-8 receptor did not affect the IL-8-dependent chemotaxis of transfected cells (Ben-Baruch et al., 2Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Biragyn A. Johnston J.J. Wang J.M. Kim J. Chuntharapai A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9121-9128Google Scholar). However, the IL-8-induced internalization of the truncated IL-8 receptor A was severely impaired (Fig. 4a). This result suggests that the distal C terminus domain is a major component of the internalization pathway of the IL-8 receptor. Since the homologous IL-8 receptor subtypes A and B exhibit high sequence diversity in their distal C termini, we examined whether IL-8 receptors shows different internalization profiles. Indeed, we found that the rate of internalization of receptor subtype B was dramatically faster than the receptor subtype A (Fig. 4c). After a 5-min exposure to 100 nM IL-8, more than 95% of IL-8 receptors B and less than 40% of receptors A were internalized. Of importance is that similar rates of IL-8-dependent internalization were observed among human and rabbit receptors of the same subtype. These results are in good agreement with a recent study in human neutrophils indicating that the IL-8-dependent internalization of receptor B is faster than receptor A (Chuntharapai and Kim, 4Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594Crossref Google Scholar). These results suggest that the C terminus domains of IL-8 receptors modulate the extent and rate of internalization of receptors. To examine this hypothesis, we created an IL-8 receptor chimera (A/B) in which the C terminus of IL-8 receptor A was substituted by the C terminus of IL-8 receptor B. As indicated in Fig. 4c, the chimeric receptor exhibited lower rates of internalization than the wild-type receptor A. This finding supports the idea that the C terminus tail of IL-8 receptor B cannot regulate the rate of internalization of IL-8 receptor A. It is possible that the C terminus of receptor B is not well coupled to the internalization pathway of the IL-8 receptor A.Fig. 4Receptor internalization. a, internalization of wild-type IL-8 receptor A and IL-8 receptor A-Del receptors.

Each point was determined in triplicate. b, internalization of rabbit IL-8 receptor A (•), rabbit IL-8 receptor B (▪), human IL-8 receptor A (○), and human IL-8 receptor B (□). c, internalization of the wild-type IL-8 receptor A versus IL-8 receptor chimera in which the C terminus of the IL-8 receptor A is replaced by the C terminus of the IL-8 receptor B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the type of ligand dictates the internalization profile of the receptors, we examined the MGSA versus IL-8-dependent internalization of the IL-8 receptor B. MGSA and IL-8 bind with similar high affinity to IL-8 receptor B, and both ligands are equally potent in inducing a Ca2+ response in cells transfected with IL-8 receptor B (LaRosa et al., 11LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.T. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Google Scholar; Lee et al., 13Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, MGSA triggered a slower rate of internalization of receptor B than IL-8. These data strongly support the idea that binding of IL-8 and MGSA to receptor B induces different structural changes of the receptor, leading to the generation of distinct internalization pathways. The functional significance of internalization of IL-8 receptor subtypes are unknown. Previous studies with the β2-adrenergic receptor system have suggested that internalization or sequestration is required for receptor resensitization (Barak et al., 1Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Google Scholar). To examine the role of internalization of receptors in neutrophils, we monitored the agonist-dependent Ca2+ responses in human neutrophils pretreated for 5 min with a saturating concentration of IL-8 (100 nM) or MGSA (100 nM). Under these conditions, IL-8-induced internalization of more than 95% of IL-8 receptor B but only less than 40% of IL-8 receptor A (Fig. 4b). On the other hand, MGSA induced internalization of less than 40% of IL-8 receptor B (Fig. 5). Following agonist treatment, neutrophils were incubated at 37°C and sequencially challenged with 100 nM MGSA and 100 nM IL-8 to induce calcium responses mediated by receptors B and A, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, MGSA and IL-8 induce a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in untreated neutrophils. However, IL-8-pretreated neutrophils incubated for a short time (5 min) at 37°C do not respond to MGSA, but the neutrophils did respond to IL-8 (Fig. 6b). Longer incubation times (1 h) were needed to obtain a calcium response with MGSA (Fig. 6c). These results suggested that the negative response observed with MGSA is primarily due to the rapid IL-8-induced rate of internalization of all of the IL-8 receptors B (Fig. 4b). The response to IL-8 is probably mediated by IL-8 receptor A that did not get completely internalized by IL-8 (Fig. 4b). Consistent with this idea, MGSA-pretreated neutrophils, in which MGSA induces a slow rate of internalization of receptors B (Fig. 5), responded quickly to both MGSA and IL-8 (Fig. 6d). This study strongly supports the hypothesis that internalization of the IL-8 receptor is a major mechanism for modulating the neutrophil responses elicited by IL-8 and its functionally related peptides such as MGSA. We are grateful to Joyce Dunn for invaluable help in the immunofluorescence experiments. We are also grateful to Dr. Guillermo Altenberg for helpful suggestions."

Recombinant human skeletal muscle sodium channels (hSkM1) were transfected into heterologous human renal epithelium HEK293t cells. Cytoplasmic delivery of 5 µM AA augmented the voltage-activated sodium current of hSkM1 channels by 190% (±54 S.E., n = 7) over a 20-min period. Similar results were seen with 5 µM oleic acid. Sodium currents in HEK293t cells transfected with human cardiac muscle sodium channels (hH1) were insensitive to AA treatment, and exposure to oleic acid inhibited the hH1 currents over a 20-min period by 29% (±13 S.E., n = 5). The increase in hSkM1 current was not accompanied by shifts in voltage dependence of activation, steady-state inactivation, or markedly altered kinetics of inactivation of the macroscopic current. The FFA-induced increase in sodium currents was not dependent on protein kinase C activity. In contrast, both isoforms were reversibly inhibited by external application of unsaturated FFA. Thus, the differential effects of FFA on skeletal muscle sodium channels first noted in cultured muscle cells can be reproduced by expressing recombinant sodium channels in epithelial cells. Although the responses to applied FFAs could be direct or indirect, we suggest that: 1) SkM1 has two classes of response to FFA, one which produces augmentation of macroscopic currents with intracellular FFA, and a second which produces inhibition with extracellular FFA; 2) H1 has only one class of response, which produces inhibition with extracellular FFA. A testable hypothesis is that the presence or absence of each response is due to a specific structure in SkM1 or H1.

We have determined the intracellular levels of ribonucleotide reductase (RRase), thioredoxin (Trx), glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), and glutathione (GSH) and the glutathione redox status in new Escherichia coli K12 strains lacking thioredoxin (trxA−), glutaredoxin 1 (grxA−), and/or GSH (gshA−) or overproducing Trx or Grx1 from multicopy plasmids. We propose a regulatory network in which RRase levels are balanced with those of Trx, Grx1, and GSH so that deficiency or overproduction of one component would promote the opposite effect on the others to maintain a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleotides. GSH deficiency strongly increased both Grx1 levels and RRase activity, even more than Trx deficiency. Double gshA−trxA− bacteria were viable, whereas additional deficiency in lipoate synthesis (gshA−trxA−lipA−) caused the inability to grow in minimal medium plates supplemented with acetate plus succinate instead of lipoic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2013804424,"This study investigates the importance of thioester-linked acyl groups in lung surfactant protein C (SP-C) in facilitating interactions with phospholipids that yield functionally important surface active behaviors. Native SP-C, palmitoylated at cysteine residues at positions 5 and 6, was isolated from bovine lung surfactant by liquid chromatography. Deacylated SP-C (dSP-C), unchanged in composition and sequence from SP-C but having a decreased α-helical content in films with dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) of 52 versus 70%, was obtained by treatment with 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer at pH 10. Surface activity was studied for SP-C and dSP-C combined with column-purified phospholipids (PPL) from calf lung surfactant or with synthetic phospholipids (DPPC or a synthetic phospholipid mixture (SPL) containing 50:35:15, DPPC:egg phosphatidylcholine:egg phosphatidylglycerol). Interfacial measurements included surface pressure time adsorption isotherms for dispersed surfactants with diffusion minimized, dynamic surface pressure area isotherms and respreading for films in the Wilhelmy balance, and overall surface tension lowering at physiologic cycling rate in oscillating bubble experiments. Dispersions of PPL:SP-C and SPL:SP-C rapidly adsorbed to high equilibrium surface pressures of 47-48 mN/m, significantly better than corresponding dispersions containing dSP-C. The adsorption of PPL:dSP-C was essentially unchanged from that of PPL alone, and the adsorption of SPL:dSP-C was improved only slightly over SPL alone. In Wilhelmy balance studies, dynamic respreading was significantly improved over phospholipids alone in films of SP-C plus PPL, SPL, or DPPC. Respreading was improved less markedly by dSP-C in corresponding films with SPL or DPPC and not at all in films with PPL. Maximum surface pressures were also higher in cycled films of SP-C versus dSP-C combined with PPL or SPL. In bubble experiments (37°C, 20 cycles/min), dispersions of PPL:SP-C and SPL:SP-C reached low minimum surface tensions of <1 and 5 mN/m, respectively, whereas PPL:dSP-C and SPL:dSP-C only reached minima of ~20 mN/m as did PPL and SPL alone. Acylation in SP-C is crucial for its interactions with phospholipids over the full spectrum of adsorption and dynamic surface behaviors important for lung surfactant.

The adsorption of PPL:dSP-C was essentially unchanged from that of PPL alone, and the adsorption of SPL:dSP-C was improved only slightly over SPL alone. In Wilhelmy balance studies, dynamic respreading was significantly improved over phospholipids alone in films of SP-C plus PPL, SPL, or DPPC. Respreading was improved less markedly by dSP-C in corresponding films with SPL or DPPC and not at all in films with PPL. Maximum surface pressures were also higher in cycled films of SP-C versus dSP-C combined with PPL or SPL. In bubble experiments (37°C, 20 cycles/min), dispersions of PPL:SP-C and SPL:SP-C reached low minimum surface tensions of <1 and 5 mN/m, respectively, whereas PPL:dSP-C and SPL:dSP-C only reached minima of ~20 mN/m as did PPL and SPL alone. Acylation in SP-C is crucial for its interactions with phospholipids over the full spectrum of adsorption and dynamic surface behaviors important for lung surfactant."

Neutral amino acids cross the blood-brain barrier by facilitative transport system L1, which may allow both desirable and undesirable amino acids to enter the brain. The sodium-dependent amino acid systems A and Bo,+ are located exclusively on abluminal membranes, in a position to pump unwanted amino acids out. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase, the first enzyme of the γ-glutamyl cycle, is an integral protein of the luminal membrane of the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrate that oxoproline, an intracellular product of the γ-glutamyl cycle, stimulates the sodium-dependent systems A and Bo,+ by 70 and 20%, respectively. Study of system A showed that 2 mM oxoproline increased the affinity for its specific substrate N-methylaminoisobutyrate by 50%. This relationship between the activity of the γ-glutamyl cycle and system A transport may provide a short term regulatory mechanism by which the entry of potentially deleterious amino acids (i.e. neurotransmitters or their precursors) may be retarded and their removal from brain accelerated.

The endothelial cells of cerebral capillaries are joined by tight junctions forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB). 1The abbreviations used are: BBBblood-brain barrierGGTγ-glutamyl transpeptidaseMeAIBN-(methylamino)isobutyric acidPSApermeability-surface area. Thus, hydrophilic nutrients, such as amino acids, require the presence of carriers in the respective luminal and abluminal membranes to reach the brain. Using isolated plasma membrane vesicles from cerebral endothelial cells it has been shown that system L1, characterized by affinity for a broad spectrum of neutral amino acids (especially large neutral amino acids) (1Christensen H.N. Oxender D.L. Liang M. Vatz K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3609-3616Google Scholar), is equally distributed between luminal and abluminal membranes (2Sánchez Pino M.M. Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Google Scholar). Therefore, system L1 is in a position to facilitate neutral amino acid movement between blood and brain. Two sodium-dependent transport systems, A and Bo,+, are also present (2Sánchez Pino M.M. Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Google Scholar, 3Sánchez Pino M.M. Hawkins R.A. Peterson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25951-25957Google Scholar), but they exist only in abluminal membranes (2Sánchez Pino M.M. Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Google Scholar). The sodium-dependent systems are, therefore, in a position to pump amino acids out of the brain extracellular fluid. Although system A preferentially transports small neutral amino acids (1Christensen H.N. Oxender D.L. Liang M. Vatz K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3609-3616Google Scholar), and system Bo,+ favors the transport of neutral and basic amino acids (4Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Google Scholar), there is a considerable overlap in the spectrum of amino acids that can be transported by each of the systems: L1, A, and Bo,+ (5Oxender D.L. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3686-3699Google Scholar). This overlap in transport activity coupled with the asymmetrical distribution of the amino acid transporters at the BBB provides a potential means for the regulation of amino acid delivery to the brain. blood-brain barrier γ-glutamyl transpeptidase N-(methylamino)isobutyric acid permeability-surface area. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is located on the luminal membrane of cerebral endothelial cells (6Sánchez Pino M.M. Hawkins R.A. Peterson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14907-14912Google Scholar). A role for GGT in amino acid transport was suggested by Meister and co-workers (7Orlowski M. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1248-1255Google Scholar, 8Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Google Scholar, 9Meister A. Science. 1973; 180: 33-39Google Scholar), as part of the γ-glutamyl cycle. However, the idea that the cycle is involved directly in amino acid translocation into cells is controversial, having received support (10Lauterburg B.H. Mitchell J.R.

Studies using mammary glands from lactating rats and placenta of pregnant rats showed that oxoproline, an intermediate of the γ-glutamyl cycle, serves as an intracellular signal to stimulate amino acid transport (23Viña J.R. Puertes I.R. Montoro J.B. Saez G.T. Viña J. Biol. Neonate. 1985; 48: 250-256Google Scholar, 24Viña J.R. Palacin M. Puertes I.R. Hernandez R. Viña J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E916-E922Google Scholar). To determine whether such a regulatory mechanism is present in the BBB, amino acid transport was measured in isolated luminal- and abluminal-enriched plasma membrane vesicles derived from bovine cerebral capillary endothelial cells. L-[ring-2,6-3H]Phenylalanine (46 Ci/mmol), N-[1-14C](methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB, 56.3 mCi/mmol), L-[14C(U)]alanine (150.9 mCi/mmol), and [14C(U)]sucrose (475 mCi/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Collagenase type IA and acivicin were obtained from Sigma. Protein assay was purchased from Bio-Rad. The intravesicular solution used in all transport experiments was storage buffer (290 mM mannitol and 10 mM HEPES, buffered with Tris to pH 7.4) unless otherwise stated. The extravesicular solution (reaction medium) was storage buffer supplemented with 100 mM KCl or 100 mM NaCl and the appropriate radiolabeled substrate, as indicated in the figure legends. Brain microvessels were isolated, and luminal and abluminal plasmalemmal vesicles were prepared by a modification (3Sánchez Pino M.M. Hawkins R.A. Peterson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25951-25957Google Scholar) of the procedure described by Betz et al. (25Betz A.L. Firth J.A. Goldstein G.W. Brain Res. 1980; 192: 17-28Google Scholar). The membranes were layered on a discontinuous Ficoll gradient (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% Ficoll) and centrifuged at 162,500 × g for 2.5 h at 4°C. Five fractions containing the membrane vesicles were collected at the different Ficoll interphases. The vesicles were then diluted in storage buffer, and aliquots were stored at −80°C until used. Storage buffer with or without oxoproline (or glutamate) was added to the frozen membrane vesicles. Vesicles opened by the freezing process reseal during thawing and incorporate the external medium (26Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Google Scholar, 27Strauss G. Schurtenberger P. Hauser H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 169-180Google Scholar, 28MacDonald R.C. Jones F.D. Qiu R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 362-370Google Scholar). The vesicles were then allowed a 2-h period for volume equilibration. Acivicin (0.25 mM), an inhibitor of GGT (29Lash L.H. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14508-14514Google Scholar), was added for the final 0.5 h of volume equilibration as a precaution against transpeptidation of amino acid substrates during the course of the experiment (e.g. γ-glutamyl amino acids that may form through reaction with glutathione). The vesicles were then centrifuged at 37,500 × g for 25 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in storage buffer at a protein concentration between 2.5 and 5 µg/µl. The reaction was started by adding 10 µl of reaction medium (see above) to 10 µl of the membrane suspension. After incubation at 37°C for the times indicated, the reaction was stopped by diluting with 1 ml of stopping solution (145 mM NaCl and 10 mM HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4) at 4°C, followed by rapid filtration over a 0.45-µm Gelman Metricel filter. The filters were rinsed four times with 1 ml of stopping solution, and the retained radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Control samples containing the same amount of radioactivity, but without membranes, were filtered as described above to correct for retention of radiolabeled material by the filter. Vesicle integrity was examined by measuring diffusional uptake of 10 µM [14C]sucrose. The synthetic amino acid analog MeAIB is especially useful because it is carried principally by the sodium-dependent transport system A (1Christensen H.N. Oxender D.L. Liang M. Vatz K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3609-3616Google Scholar, 30Christensen H.N. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 576-616Google Scholar, 31Grammas P. Kwaiser T.M. Caspers M.L. Neuropharmacology. 1992; 31: 409-412Google Scholar, 32Kilberg M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 183-186Google Scholar) with a Km between 300 and 700 µM (2Sánchez Pino M.M. Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Google Scholar, 33Schenerman M.A. Kilberg M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 428-436Google Scholar). The only other transport system that has been shown to have any affinity for MeAIB is the sodium-dependent system Gly which transports glycine, sarcosine, and some imino acids (30Christensen H.N. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 576-616Google Scholar). However, the affinity of system Gly for MeAIB is poor with a Km an order of magnitude higher (12 mM) (34Munck L.K. Munck B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1116: 91-96Google Scholar). We determined the Km in abluminal BBB membranes to be 560 µM (see “Results” and Table II) as expected for system A. There was evidence for a second component that accounted for only 3% of the total rate of transport and was indistinguishable from diffusion (data not shown). We concluded that MeAIB was carried principally, if not exclusively, by the system A transporter.Table IIEffect of oxoproline on the kinetic parameters of system A in abluminal-enriched bovine cerebral vesiclesTreatment of vesiclesVmaxKmnmol·;min−1·;mg protein−1µMControl (7Orlowski M.

Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Google Scholar). This system, known as Bo,+, transports neutral and basic amino acids but has no affinity for MeAIB (30Christensen H.N. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 576-616Google Scholar). System Bo,+ also transports 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), which is not transported by system A (4Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Google Scholar, 30Christensen H.N. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 576-616Google Scholar, 32Kilberg M.S. Trends Biochem.

To determine the transport activity of system Bo,+, the uptake of alanine, a substrate of both systems A and Bo,+, was measured in the presence of 5 mM MeAIB. This concentration is sufficient to block 90% of the activity associated with system A. The facilitative system L1 has a strong affinity for large neutral amino acids but has neither a dependence on a sodium gradient nor an affinity for MeAIB (1Christensen H.N. Oxender D.L. Liang M. Vatz K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3609-3616Google Scholar, 36Shotwell M.A. Jayme D.W. Kilberg M.S. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5422-5427Google Scholar). Therefore, phenylalanine was used as the substrate to measure system L1 in the absence of a sodium gradient. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein microassay, with bovine serum albumin as the standard (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). In transport studies where uptake was measured as a function of time, the data were fitted to a single exponential equation: uptake = A(1 − e−kt). A double exponential equation, uptake = A1(1 − e−k1t) − A2(1 − e−k2t), was used when an inwardly directed sodium gradient caused a transient outwardly directed amino acid gradient. The initial rates of transport were calculated as the product of Ak in the absence of a sodium gradient, or A1k1− A2k2 in the presence of a sodium gradient. The PSA represents the sum of specific and nonspecific transport components (Vmax*(S + Km)−1+ Kd). The PSA values, expressed as µl·min−1·mg of protein−1, were obtained by measuring the initial rate of clearance of radiolabel from the medium. Substrate transport was determined as the product of the substrate concentration and PSA. A best fit analysis was employed to determine the kinetic parameters using the Michaelis-Menten equation and included a term for nonspecific diffusion, (Vmax*[S]/Km+ [S]) + Kd[S]. Five membrane fractions were obtained at the interfaces of a discontinuous Ficoll gradient (Fig. 1). Fractions 1 (0/5% interface, enriched in GGT), and 3 (10/15% interface, enriched in system A activity), were taken as luminal and abluminal enriched membranes, respectively (3Sánchez Pino M.M. Hawkins R.A. Peterson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25951-25957Google Scholar). The integrity of membrane vesicles was assessed by measuring the PSA of [14C]sucrose. The PSA values were 0.21 and 0.13 µl·min−1·mg of protein−1 for luminal and abluminal vesicles, respectively. Loading of abluminal vesicles with 2 mM oxoproline gave a similar value, 0.11 µl·min−1·mg of protein−1. These values were considerably less than the permeability measured for substrates (see below), indicating that nonspecific diffusion was a minor component of uptake at short incubation times. In the presence of an inwardly directed sodium gradient, MeAIB was initially concentrated in the vesicles (overshoot) and then gradually declined to an equilibrium value following dissipation of the sodium gradient (Fig. 2A). The overshoot effect was greater in vesicles preloaded with 2 mM oxoproline. No overshoot was observed when potassium was substituted for sodium, whether or not oxoproline was present (Fig. 2B). Oxoproline also stimulated the initial rate of MeAIB transport by system A (Fig. 3). This effect was concentration-dependent and maximal at about 2 mM. Therefore, 2 mM oxoproline was used for the remaining experiments. The magnitude of the stimulatory effect of oxoproline on the initial rate of system A transport was shown by a comparison of the PSA (Table I). In the absence of a sodium gradient, oxoproline had no stimulatory effect. However, in the presence of a sodium gradient, oxoproline stimulated the initial rate of MeAIB transport by about 70%.Table IStimulation of the initial rate of MeAIB transport by oxoproline in abluminal-enriched membranesPresence of oxoprolineSodium gradientPSAµl·;min−1·;mg protein−1NoYes6.5 ± 0.9YesYes11.1 ± 0.5*NoNo0.6 ± 0.1YesNo0.5 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab The sodium-dependent transport of 100 µM [14C]alanine was measured over 15 s in the presence and absence of MeAIB to determine the activity of system Bo,+ transport activity. MeAIB-insensitive alanine transport in the presence and absence of oxoproline was 367 ± 5 and 307 ± 6 pmol·min−1·mg of protein−1, respectively, indicating that oxoproline stimulated system Bo,+ transport by about 20%. Kinetic constants were measured to characterize further the effect of oxoproline on system A transport because it was stimulated to a greater degree than system Bo,+. The presence of oxoproline decreased the Km by 50%, with no change in the Vmax (Table II). Control vesicles loaded with glutamate, a metabolite of oxoproline, showed no stimulation of transport. Phenylalanine was used as a representative substrate to measure system L1 transport activity. No effect of oxoproline was observed. The Km of the L1 system for phenylalanine in control and oxoproline loaded-vesicles was 12.0 ± 0.6 and 11.7 ± 0.9 µM, respectively. The Vmax in the control and loaded vesicles was 0.129 ± 0.007 and 0.130 ± 0.004 nmol·mg of protein−1·min−1, respectively. The principal findings were as follows. 1) Oxoproline accelerated the initial rate of substrate transport by the two sodium-dependent amino acid carriers known to be at the abluminal membrane of the BBB (systems A and Bo,+). 2) System A, which was stimulated to the greatest degree, manifested an increased affinity for its substrate. 3) There was no effect of oxoproline on the facilitated transport of phenylalanine. These observations suggest that oxoproline, produced as part of the γ-glutamyl cycle (7Orlowski M. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1248-1255Google Scholar, 8Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Google Scholar, 9Meister A. Science. 1973; 180: 33-39Google Scholar), may be an important link in the short term control of sodium-dependent amino acid transport by the BBB. System L1 is distributed symmetrically between the luminal and abluminal membrane domains of cerebral endothelial cells (2Sánchez Pino M.M. Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Google Scholar) and serves to facilitate the diffusion of neutral amino acids between blood and brain. Although L1 is characterized by a high affinity for large neutral amino acids, it has a measurable affinity for almost all neutral amino acids (38Smith Q.R. Momma S. Aoyagi M. Rapoport S.I. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1651-1658Google Scholar). There is also a nonsaturable component that may allow an additional influx of neutral amino acids, accounting for about 5% of carrier-mediated transport (38Smith Q.R. Momma S. Aoyagi M. Rapoport S.I. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1651-1658Google Scholar). The combined effect of these two pathways could provide a supply of both essential and nonessential amino acids, some of which may be neurotransmitters or modulators of neurotransmission. Two sodium-dependent amino acid transport systems (A and Bo,+) are present exclusively on the abluminal membrane of the BBB (2Sánchez Pino M.M. Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Google Scholar). The capacity of these transporters is an order of magnitude greater than the facilitative transporter L1 (2Sánchez Pino M.M. Peterson D.R. Hawkins R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14913-14918Google Scholar). Because the electrochemical gradient for sodium is oriented to flow from the extracellular fluid into the endothelial cells, these sodium-dependent transport systems are in a position to export amino acids from the brain extracellular fluid. Thus, amino acids that pass both endothelial cell membranes and enter the basement membrane space could be actively, and selectively, pumped back across the abluminal membrane. This asymmetrical distribution of sodium-dependent carriers has the potential, therefore, to restrict the availability of amino acids to the brain. The γ-glutamyl cycle has been shown to influence amino acid transport in diverse tissues. The first reaction of the cycle occurs extracellularly and is catalyzed by GGT (8Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Google Scholar). Glutathione is exported across the luminal membrane, and transpeptidation occurs in the presence of extracellular amino acids. The γ-glutamyl amino acids that result enter cells by a transport system that is not shared by free amino acids. Intracellularly, γ-glutamyl amino acids are substrates of γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase, which converts the γ-glutamyl amino acids into oxoproline and the corresponding free amino acids. The subsequent conversion of oxoproline to glutamate by oxoprolinase is the rate-limiting step of the γ-glutamyl cycle (39Van Der Werf P. Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. 1975; 43: 519-554Google Scholar). Irrespective of whether the γ-glutamyl cycle directly mediates significant amino acid transport, it does seem to influence amino acid transport systems. This has been shown in mammary glands of lactating rats and placenta of pregnant rats in which the activity of the γ-glutamyl cycle was correlated with active amino acid transport (23Viña J.R. Puertes I.R. Montoro J.B. Saez G.T. Viña J. Biol. Neonate. 1985; 48: 250-256Google Scholar, 24Viña J.R. Palacin M. Puertes I.R. Hernandez R. Viña J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E916-E922Google Scholar). Specifically, it appears that oxoproline, produced intracellularly as an intermediary metabolite of the γ-glutamyl cycle, acts as a signal to activate the translocation of amino acids into these tissues. The presence of GGT in the BBB has been an enigma. GGT activity is high in tissues that actively transport amino acids (8Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Google Scholar), such as the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney (42Curto K.A. Sweeney W.E. Avner E.D. Piesco N.P. Curthoys N.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 159-166Google Scholar), the lactating mammary gland (43Puente I.R. Saez G.T. FEBS Lett. 1979; 126: 250-252Google Scholar), and the apical portion of the intestinal epithelium (44Garvey T.Q. Hyman P.E. Isselbacher K.J. Gastroenterology. 1976; 71: 778-785Google Scholar). The BBB differs from these tissues in that it is not associated with active amino acid uptake from plasma. Although brain requires essential amino acids for its function and growth, their supply is not much greater than the demand, and it is difficult to detect arteriovenous differences of amino acids across the brain (45Hawkins R.A. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2055-2059Google Scholar, 46Sacks W. Sacks S. Brebbia D.R. Fleischer A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1982; 7: 431-436Google Scholar). It has, therefore, been puzzling why brain capillaries have such high GGT activity. Our data support the hypothesis that the γ-glutamyl cycle and GGT serve to monitor the availability of amino acids to the brain and constitute the first step in a control mechanism that influences the accessibility and content of brain amino acids (Fig. 4). The question arises whether the oxoproline concentrations that exist in vivo are sufficient to stimulate sodium-dependent transport. Although we are unaware of measurements of oxoproline in cerebral microvessels, the concentrations in normal human plasma and various tissue extracts are between 20 and 50 µM (39Van Der Werf P. Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. 1975; 43: 519-554Google Scholar, 40Van Der Werf P. Stephani R.A. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1026-1029Google Scholar) and as high as 6 mM in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in pathological conditions (41Meister A. Laufer R.S. Warren E. McIvor D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1983: 348Google Scholar). Stimulation of sodium-dependent transport of MeAIB was a linear function of the oxoproline concentration up to 2 mM, a range that does not seem unreasonable. The transpeptidation activity of GGT is a function of the plasma concentration and spectrum of amino acids (47Allison R.D. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2988-2992Google Scholar), both of which may vary considerably, depending on nutritional status. This provides a feedback mechanism in which the γ-glutamyl amino acids produced by GGT enter cerebral capillary endothelial cells and are converted to oxoproline, which in turn activates the A system at the abluminal membrane. Since the A system is oriented to remove amino acids from the brain in an energy-dependent fashion, its up-regulation could provide a control mechanism to guard against elevations of amino acids in brain when their availability is excessive. This is of particular interest with regard to smaller nonessential amino acids for which system A has a relatively high affinity. Thus, this process may serve to modulate entry of amino acids that serve as neurotransmitters or their precursors."

This mutation results in an enhanced affinity for thyroxine. Site-directed mutagenesis and a yeast protein expression system were used to synthesize wild type HSA and FDH HSA as well as several other HSA mutants. Studies on the binding of thyroxine to these HSA species using equilibrium dialysis and quenching of tryptophan 214 fluorescence suggest that the FDH mutation affects a single thyroxine binding site located in the 2A subdomain of HSA. Site-directed mutagenesis of HSA and thyroxine analogs were used to obtain information about the mechanism of thyroxine binding to both wild type and FDH HSA. These studies suggest that the guanidino group of arginine at amino acid position 218 in wild type HSA is involved in an unfavorable binding interaction with the amino group of thyroxine, whereas histidine at amino acid position 218 in FDH HSA is involved in a favorable binding interaction with thyroxine. Neither arginine at amino acid position 222 nor tryptophan at amino acid position 214 appears to favorably influence the binding of thyroxine to wild type HSA.

Recently, it was shown that recombinantly produced FDH HSA has an enhanced affinity for thyroxine similar to that seen for natural FDH HSA (11Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Mandel M. Bhagavan N.V. Biochem.

Early studies used equilibrium dialysis to measure the binding of radiolabeled thyroxine and radiolabeled thyroxine analogs to HSA. Interpretation of these results was complicated by the observation of several binding components, which were difficult to resolve. For example, some of these studies assigned four equal binding sites for thyroxine with dissociation constants (Kd) of 6.6 µM (12Sterling K. Tabachnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2241-2243Google Scholar, 13Sterling K. Rosen P. Tabachnick M. J. Clin. Invest. 1962; 41: 1021-1030Google Scholar, 14Sterling K. J. Clin. Invest. 1964; 43: 1721-1729Google Scholar), whereas other studies resolved the binding data into two sites with Kd values of 3.6 µM and six sites with Kd values of 25 µM (15Tabachnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1242-1249Google Scholar, 16Tabachnick M. Giorgio Jr., N.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 105: 563-569Google Scholar). Data from other equilibrium dialysis studies were interpreted as fitting best to a multi-site model with one high affinity site (Kd value of 0.83 µM) and six lower affinity site (Kd values of 15 µM) (17Tabachnick M. Downs F.J. Giorgio N.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 136: 467-479Google Scholar). The aforementioned results indicated that HSA has multiple thyroxine binding sites, whereas the existence of a specific thyroxine binding site in the 2A subdomain of HSA was suggested by other observations. Specifically, the 2A subdomain has been shown to be one of the two principal binding sites on HSA for small hydrophobic ligands (24Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1975; 2: 129-140Google Scholar, 25Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 1052-1061Google Scholar, 26Carter D.C. He X.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 208-215Google Scholar, 27Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-201Google Scholar). Binding studies with proteolytic HSA fragments have shown that the high affinity bilirubin binding site of HSA is located in the 2A subdomain (28Reed R.G. Feldhoff R.C. Clute O.L. Peters Jr., T. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4578-4583Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that thyroxine competes with bilirubin binding at this high affinity bilirubin binding site, suggesting that the sites for these two ligands overlap (29Kamikubo K. Sakata S. Nakamura S. Komaki T. Miura K. J. Protein Chem. 1990; 9: 461-465Google Scholar). HSA contains a single tryptophan residue at amino acid position 214, which is located in the 2A subdomain, and the fluorescence of this tryptophan is quenched by the binding of thyroxine (23Steiner R.F. Roth J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 560-567Google Scholar, 30Dughi C. Bhagavan N.V. Jameson D.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 416-419Google Scholar). This quenching has been exploited to measure the binding of thyroxine (23Steiner R.F. Roth J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 560-567Google Scholar, 30Dughi C. Bhagavan N.V. Jameson D.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 416-419Google Scholar), bilirubin (31Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2301Google Scholar), and a number of other 2A ligands (32Chatelain P. Matteazzi J.R. Laurel R. J. Pharm. Sci. 1994; 83: 674-776Google Scholar, 33Wilting J. van der Giesen W.F. Janssen L.H. Weideman M.M. Otagiri M. Perrin J.H. J. Biol.

Studies measuring thyroxine binding to HSA by the fluorescence quenching method indicated a single high affinity site with a Kd value of 0.63 µM (23Steiner R.F. Roth J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 560-567Google Scholar), in close agreement with the high affinity site (Kd of 0.83 µM) determined from equilibrium dialysis experiments (17Tabachnick M. Downs F.J. Giorgio N.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 136: 467-479Google Scholar). To improve our understanding of the mechanism of thyroxine binding to the 2A subdomain of HSA, we used site-directed mutagenesis and a protein expression system to synthesize wild type HSA, FDH HSA, and several HSA mutants. The fluorescence quenching technique was used to measure the binding affinity of thyroxine and the thyroxine analogs, tetraiodothyroacetic acid (TA), 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3), 3,5,3′-triiodothyropropionic acid (TP), and 3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine (RT3) to wild type HSA and to the HSA mutants (with the exception of a mutant in which leucine was substituted for tryptophan). The binding of thyroxine to wild type HSA and to the mutants was also measured by equilibrium dialysis. The following HSA mutants were synthesized: R218H (FDH) and R218M HSA substituting histidine or methionine for arginine at amino acid position 218, respectively; W214L HSA substituting leucine for tryptophan at amino acid position 214; R222M HSA substituting methionine for arginine at amino acid position 222. Recombinant wild type HSA was also produced. With human liver cDNA as template, the entire coding region of the HSA gene including the native signal sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the plasmid vector pHiL-D2 (Invitrogen Corporation) using standard cloning techniques. pHiL-D2 is a shuttle vector that can be manipulated by cloning in Escherichia coli and that can also be used to introduce genes into the yeast species Pichia pastoris (Invitrogen Corporation) by homologous recombination. Specific mutations were introduced into the HSA coding region by using site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (11Petersen C.E. Ha C.-E. Mandel M. Bhagavan N.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1121-1129Google Scholar). Each pHiL-D2 expression plasmid contained a methanol-inducible promoter upstream of the HSA coding region. For each expression plasmid a yeast clone was isolated that contained the expression cassette stably integrated into the yeast chromosomal DNA. The native HSA signal sequence, which was left on the HSA coding region, directed high level secretion of mature HSA into the growth medium. The secreted HSA was isolated from growth medium as follows. The medium was brought to 50% saturation with ammonium sulfate at room temperature. The temperature was then lowered to 4°C, and the pH was adjusted to 4.4, the isoelectric point of HSA. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in distilled water. Dialysis was carried out for 48 h at 4°C against 100 volumes of distilled water, followed by 24 h against 100 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM phosphate, pH 7.4). The solution was loaded onto a column of cibacron blue immobilized on Sepharose 6B (Sigma) (35Travis J. Bowen J. Tewksbury D. Johnson D. Pannell R. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 301-306Google Scholar). After washing the column with 10 bed volumes of PBS, the HSA was eluted with 3 M NaCl. The eluent was dialyzed into PBS and passed over a column of Lipidex-1000 (Packard Instruments) to remove hydrophobic ligands possibly bound to the HSA (36Glatz J.F.C. Veerkamp J.H. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1983; 8: 57-61Google Scholar). The resulting protein exhibited only one band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The total genomic DNA from each P. pastoris clone used to produce a particular HSA species was isolated using standard techniques. The genomic DNA isolated from each clone was used as template to amplify the entire HSA coding region by polymerase chain reaction. For each clone the entire HSA coding region was sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination technique, and the translation product corresponding to this sequence was found to match a previously published HSA sequence at all amino acid positions except for the mutation introduced into a particular HSA mutant (37Minghetti P.P. Ruffner D.E. Kuang W.J. Dennison O.E. Hawkins J.W. Beattie W.G. Dugaiczyk A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6747-6757Google Scholar). As previously shown (23Steiner R.F. Roth J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 560-567Google Scholar, 30Dughi C. Bhagavan N.V. Jameson D.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 416-419Google Scholar) the emission spectrum of HSA overlaps significantly with the absorption spectrum of thyroxine, suggesting that quenching of tryptophan 214 occurs via a nonradiative energy transfer process. The critical distance (Ro) for 50% transfer efficiency was estimated to be approximately 20 Å (30Dughi C. Bhagavan N.V. Jameson D.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 416-419Google Scholar). Given the strong (sixth power) distance dependence of Förster type energy transfer (38Foster T. Ann. Phys. Ser. XII. 1948; 2: 55-75Google Scholar), transfer can only occur when thyroxine is bound to HSA, i.e. free thyroxine does not contribute to the quenching. Moreover, given an Ro of 20 Å, we can assume that thyroxine molecules bound to the 2A subdomain, which contains tryptophan 214, are primarily responsible for the quenching. Hence, the net decrease in fluorescence of HSA upon serial additions of thyroxine is directly proportional to the fraction of HSA molecules with thyroxine bound. To determine the dissociation constant for the thyroxine (or thyroxine analog)/HSA equilibrium, two separate experiments are required. Firstly, a high concentration of HSA is titrated with ligand to approximate, as closely as possible, stochiometric binding. In this case a plot of fluorescence versus the ligand/HSA ratio shows an initial monotonic decrease in fluorescence, which then plateaus at a minimum value reflecting the fraction of fluorescence not quenched by bound ligand. Secondly, a lower concentration of HSA is titrated with ligand, and the fraction of HSA molecules with bound ligand can be calculated knowing the quenching efficiency determined from the stochiometric binding isotherm described above. The Kd can then be calculated knowing the bound and free ligand concentrations at any HSA concentration. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the 1-cm path length extinction coefficient E1% of 5.3 (39Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade P.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832Google Scholar) and by the Lowry method (the concentration of W214L HSA, which lacks tryptophan, was only determined by the Lowry method). The Lowry reagents purchased as a kit (Sigma) included a bovine serum albumin standard (concentration determined gravimetrically), which was used to generate a standard curve. Determinations by either method differed by less than 5%. Thyroxine and thyroxine analog concentrations were determined by the dry weight method. Fluorescence intensity measurements were made on an SLM 8000C spectrofluorimeter (SLM-Aminco, Champaign, IL) upgraded with ISS, Inc. (Champaign, IL) data acquisition hardware and software. Samples were excited at 280 nm with a 4 nm band pass, and emission at wavelengths longer than 300 nm was viewed through a Schott WG 305 cuton filter. All HSA samples were suspended in the buffer, 40 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM EDTA (PBSE). The fluorescence intensity of the buffer blank was subtracted from all measurements. For all titrations, 800 µl of an HSA solution was placed in a dual path length fluorescence cuvette (10 × 2 mm) with the short path length oriented toward the emission side maintained at a temperature of 37°C by a constant temperature circulator. After each addition of ligand, the sample was mixed using a pasteur pipette, and after 3 min the fluorescence intensity was recorded (the sample was not illuminated until the measurement commenced). All ligand stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the ligand at a concentration of 400 µM in 5 mM sodium hydroxide. Ligand stocks for some titrations were prepared by diluting concentrated stocks with distilled water. Wild type, R218H (FDH HSA), R218M, R222M, and W214L HSA were all treated identically. For the ligands thyroxine, TA, and RT3, a 10 µM HSA solution was titrated to a ligand/HSA mole ratio of four. Because of the lower binding affinity of T3 and TP, for HSA a 40 µM HSA solution was titrated with these ligands to a ligand/HSA mole ratio of four. Because W214L HSA does not contain tryptophan we used it as a control to determine to what extent the fluorescence due to the 18 tyrosine residues in HSA was quenchable by each ligand used in this study. Wild type, R218H (FDH HSA), R218M, and R222M HSA were all treated identically. For thyroxine, TA, and RT3, 800 µl of a 0.4 µM HSA solution was titrated with the ligand. Because of the lower binding affinity of HSA for T3 and TP, a 3.0 µM HSA solution was titrated with ligand. The fraction of HSA molecules with a molecule of thyroxine bound at each point along the titration was taken as the fraction of the quenchable signal due to tryptophan 214 actually quenched at that point in the titration. For the binding of each HSA species to each of the ligands, the quenchable fluorescent signal due to tryptophan 214 was derived from the plateau region of the stochiometric quenching curve of that HSA species with that ligand as described below. All fluorescence measurements were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects. Inner filter effects can arise due to either the absorption of the exciting light or by absorption of the emission by the ligands. These corrections were, in all cases, small (<5%) and were estimated for each ligand by the following method. 800 µl of a 10 µML-tryptophan solution was added to the same cuvette that had been used for all of the fluorescent quenching experiments. The L-tryptophan solution was titrated with increasing amounts of ligand, and fluorescence intensity measurements were corrected for dilution. The assumption was made that there was no specific interaction between any of the ligands and L-tryptophan and that the reduction in the dilution corrected fluorescent intensity was entirely due to inner filter effects. These data could then be used to correct titrations of HSA with ligand for inner filter effects. 800 µl of a 180 µML-tyrosine solution was also titrated with each ligand. The data from the titration of L-tyrosine were used to correct titrations of W214L HSA with each ligand for inner filter effects. To avoid any contribution from tyrosine fluorescence, the HSA samples, ideally, should be excited at 300 nm or the fluorescence should be measured at wavelengths longer than 340 nm. The fluorescence signal obtained under these conditions, however, was too low to permit accurate intensity measurements with our instrumentation for some samples, and hence 280 nm excitation was utilized. The tyrosine contribution to the total fluorescence intensity of HSA and the HSA mutants is, however, small and can be estimated and accounted for in the following manner. Comparison of the fluorescence intensity of a 10 µM solution of W214L HSA, which does not contain tryptophan, to the fluorescence intensity of a 10 µM solution of wild type, R218H (FDH), R218M, and R222M HSA showed that the percentage of the total fluorescence due to tyrosine was 15, 20, 11, and 14% respectively. The fluorescence of a 10 µM solution of W214L HSA was found to be about 40% maximally quenchable for titrations up to a ligand/HSA mole ratio of four with the ligands thyroxine, TA, and RT3. The fluorescence of a 40 µM solution of W214L HSA was found to be about 65% maximally quenchable for titrations to a ligand/HSA mole ratio of four with the ligands T3 and TP. The value of the minimum relative fluorescence obtained at the plateau region in the stochiometric titrations of wild type, R218H, R218M, and R222M HSA with all of the ligands was corrected for the reduction in fluorescence due to the quenching of tyrosine fluorescence as follows. The percentage of the total fluorescence in each HSA solution due to tyrosine was multiplied by the fraction of that fluorescence determined to be quenched in a stochiometric titration of W214L HSA. This quenchable tyrosine fluorescence was added to the minimum relative fluorescence value experimentally obtained at the plateau region of a stochiometric titration of a particular HSA variant with a particular ligand to yield a corrected minimum relative fluorescence due only to the quenching of tryptophan. These data were then used to determine the fraction of the total fluorescent signal that was quenchable as a result of the quenching of tryptophan 214 fluorescence by the binding of ligand. Because the titrations used to determine the Kd values were carried out at much lower HSA and ligand concentrations, we assumed that the quenching of tyrosine fluorescence would be minimal for these titrations and made the assumption that all of the reduction in fluorescence intensity in these titrations was due to the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. In order to demonstrate that the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by thyroxine was reversible, the following experiment was carried out. Wild type, R218H, R218M, and R222M HSA were all treated identically. 800 µl of a 5 µM HSA solution was titrated with thyroxine to a ligand/HSA mole ratio of one. W214L HSA was then added to a W214L HSA/ligand mole ratio of one. The fluorescence due to tyrosine was assumed to be insignificantly quenchable in this range of thyroxine concentrations. Fluorescence intensity measurements were corrected for inner filter effects, for dilution, and for the increase in fluorescence due to the addition of W214L HSA. Relative total fluorescence values were converted to relative tryptophan fluorescence values by subtracting the tyrosine fluorescence from all intensity measurements. The expectation of this experiment was that W214L HSA would compete for thyroxine with the HSA species being titrated, reducing the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. A novel technique known as “waterbug” dialysis (40Suter-Crazzolara C. Unsicker K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 204Google Scholar) was used to measure the binding of radiolabeled thyroxine to wild type, R218H, R218M, R222M, and W214L HSA. Equilibrium dialysis was carried out at 37°C in PBSE. The cap from a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube was used as a dialysis chamber. A small piece of dialysis membrane composed of regenerated cellulose with a molecular weight cut-off of 14,000 (Spectrum) was fastened over the open portion of the lid with a plastic ring obtained by cutting off the top of the Eppendorf tube from which the cap was obtained. 100 µl of a 10 µM HSA solution was added to a certain amount of radiolabeled thyroxine (DuPont NEN). The specific activity of radiolabeled thyroxine was 1280 µCi/µg. The resulting solution was then placed into the Eppendorf cap, and the chamber was sealed with a piece of dialysis membrane as described above. The sealed chamber, which was buoyant, was placed in a polypropylene tube containing 5 ml of a solution of unlabeled thyroxine of a certain concentration so that the dialysis membrane of the chamber was in contact with the 5-ml solution. The tube was incubated with gentle shaking for 24 h in an incubator maintained at 37°C. After incubation a 50-µl sample was removed from inside and outside the chamber, and both samples were counted in a γ counter. The free thyroxine concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 20 µM for all HSA species. For free thyroxine concentrations of 0.01 and 20 µM controls were run with no HSA added to the dialysis chamber to show that after 24 h a 50-µl sample from inside and a 50-µl sample from outside the chamber contained the same amount of radioactivity regardless of whether the radiolabeled thyroxine was initially added to the inside or outside of the chamber. All HSA species synthesized for this study were expressed at a level of approximately 500 mg/liter of induction medium. Recombinantly produced wild type and FDH HSA were found to be fully reactive with an antibody against authentic HSA. All purified recombinant HSA species were homogeneous as judged from denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. All recombinant HSA species produced for this study ran at the same position as commercial HSA (Sigma) in denaturing electrophoresis gels. DNA sequencing confirmed that the DNA sequence of the HSA coding region derived from each of the yeast clones producing a particular HSA species was as expected. The normalized stochiometric quenching data for the binding of thyroxine to all HSA species is shown (Fig. 1). The x axis indicates the ligand/HSA mole ratio, whereas the y axis is the observed fluorescence. The stochiometric quenching curves of all HSA species for a particular ligand are quite similar. One notable exception is the stochiometric quenching curve for the binding of R222M to RT3, which is significantly different than that observed for RT3 binding to the other HSA species. All titrations of a particular HSA species with a particular ligand were done three times. The fraction of HSA molecules with a ligand molecule bound (number bound) and the free ligand concentration were determined at each point along the titration. Each of the three data sets for each Kd determination were fit to the equation shown below by nonlinear regression (least squares method) using the computer program Prism (Graphpad). Numberbound=1/1+10(^(logKd−log free ligand concentration)∗H))(Eq. 1) The variable H is the Hill coefficient and is a measure of the degree to which the relationship between the number bound and the log of the free ligand concentration deviates from simple binding. For simple binding with no positive or negative cooperativity the Hill coefficient is 1. In arriving at the best fit of the data to this equation, the computer varied both the Kd value and the Hill coefficient and reported a best fit value for both. Each Kd and Hill coefficient was determined by averaging the three Kd values and the three Hill coefficients determined in each of the triplicate titrations. These Kd values and Hill coefficients were used to generate a theoretical binding curve for the binding of each HSA species to each ligand. Because all three of the replicate titrations were done identically, an average data set was created by averaging the number bound and free ligand concentration at each point on the titration for all three data sets. This data set is shown along with the theoretical curve derived from all three data sets for each Kd determination (Fig. 2, A-E). Kd values and Hill coefficients for the binding of all HSA species to all ligands are compiled in Table I. Also, shown in Table I is a value equal to the free energy of association of a particular HSA species with a particular ligand minus the free energy of association of wild type HSA with thyroxine. This value represents the free energy difference resulting from a change in thyroxine and/or a change in the HSA binding site.Table IKd values and corresponding free energy differences determined by fluorescence quenchingThyroxineTAT3TPRT3Wild typeKd (µM)2.3 ± 0.60.22 ± 0.0518.0 ± 2.82.6 ± 0.71.1 ± 0.3Hill coefficient0.93 ± 0.110.91 ± 0.101.00 ± 0.081.48 ± 0.180.79 ± 0.11ΔG (kcal)0.00−1.441.260.08−0.45R222MKd (µM)1.4 ± 0.50.17 ± 0.0610.0 ± 1.43.3 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.09Hill coefficient0.76 ± 0.130.71 ± 0.121.33 ± 0.091.89 ± 0.040.70 ± 0.03ΔG (kcal)−0.30−1.600.900.22−0.45R218MKd (µM)0.54 ± 0.060.095 ± 0.0297.9 ± 0.83.4 ± 0.40.51 ± 0.09Hill coefficient0.72 ± 0.100.82 ± 0.041.11 ± 0.181.77 ± 0.260.90 ± 0.15ΔG (kcal)−0.89−1.960.760.24−0.93R218HKd (µM)0.17 ± 0.050.049 ± 0.0143.4 ± 0"

To test the hypothesis that a reduction of CETP mRNA in the liver by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) may affect the plasma lipoprotein cholesterol levels, we intravenously injected antisense ODNs against rabbit CETP coupled with asialoglycoprotein carrier molecules, which serve as an important method to regulate liver gene expression, to cholesterol-fed rabbits via their ear veins. All rabbits were fed a standard rabbit chow supplement with 0.1% cholesterol for 10 weeks before and throughout the experiment.

The homozygotes for CETP deficiency demonstrated markedly elevated HDL-C and plasma apoA-I levels as well as decreased LDL cholesterol and plasma apoB levels (4Koizumi J. Mabuchi H. Yoshimura A. Michishita I. Takeda M. Itoh H. Sakai Y. Sakai T. Ueda K. Takeda R. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 58: 175-186Google Scholar, 6Inazu A. Brown M.L. Hesler C.B. Agellon L.B. Koizumi J. Tanaka K. Maruhama Y. Mabuchi H. Tall A.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1234-1238Google Scholar). CETP-deficient subjects have also been found to have a substantially increased catabolic rate of apoB as the primary metabolic basis for the low plasma levels of LDL apo B (7Ikewaki K. Nishiwaki M. Sakamoto T. Ishikawa T. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Nagano M. Nakamura H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1573-1581Google Scholar). This finding indicates that the LDL receptor pathway may thus be up-regulated during CETP deficiency. It has also been proposed that a CETP deficiency may be associated with protection against ishemic heart disease, based on the observed longevity in one kindred (3Saito F. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1984; 33: 629-633Google Scholar), as well as the lack of any evidence of coronary heart disease (6Inazu A. Brown M.L. Hesler C.B. Agellon L.B. Koizumi J. Tanaka K. Maruhama Y. Mabuchi H. Tall A.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1234-1238Google Scholar) in other kindreds with CETP deficiency; however, these findings remain controversial. Several other lines of evidence also support the hypothesis. The plasma level of CETP is directly correlated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis in monkeys fed a cholesterol diet (8Quinet E. Tall A.R. Ramakrishnan R. Rudel L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 87: 1559-1566Google Scholar). A transgenic mouse overexpressing simian CETP developed accelerated atherosclerosis (9Marotti K.R. Castle C.K. Boyle T.P. Lin A.H. Murray R.W. Melchior G.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 73-75Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of plasma CETP activity may potentially be a novel method of reducing the plasma levels of LDL cholesterol by enhancing LDL catabolism (7Ikewaki K. Nishiwaki M. Sakamoto T. Ishikawa T. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Nagano M. Nakamura H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Rader D.J. J. Clin.

Since the liver is the major tissue responsible for the production of CETP (CETP mRNA) in rabbits (10Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B. Kroon P.A. Marcel Y.L. Lee Y.C. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 357-363Google Scholar, 11Nagashima M. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1643-1649Google Scholar) (even though adipose tissue may also be the major tissue responsible for the production of CETP in monkeys (12Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 11: 1759-1771Google Scholar)), a reduction of CETP in the liver by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) may thus cause a reduction in the plasma LDL and/or VLDL cholesterol concentrations. The present study was therefore undertaken to determine the effect of an intravenous injection with antisense ODNs to the liver on the CETP mRNA expression, plasma CETP activity and plasma cholesterol concentrations in rabbits fed a low cholesterol diet. These antisense ODNs were originally designed to be coupled with asialoglycoprotein carrier molecules, and this coupling serves as an important method to regulate liver gene expression (13Lu X.M. Fischman A.J. Jyawook S.L. Hendricks K. Tompkins R.G. Yarmush M.L. J. Nucl. Med. 1994; 35: 269-275Google Scholar). cholesteryl ester transfer protein high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein oligodeoxynucleotide very low density lipoprotein polymerase chain reaction. The sequences of ODNs against rabbit CETP used in this study were as follows: antisense, 5′-CTTGACCCGGCCGAGGAGCAT-3′; sense, 5′-ATGCTCCTCGGCCGGGTCAAG-3′, positions +148 to +168 of the rabbit sequence (11Nagashima M. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1643-1649Google Scholar). These selected target sequences have relatively low homology with any of the other known cDNA sequences found in the GenBank data base. The synthetic ODNs were purified on the column, dried down, resuspended in Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA), and then quantitated by spectrophotometry. Asialoglycoprotein-poly-L-lysine (Mr approximately 71,400), which was prepared according to the method of Wu and Wu (14Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4429-4432Google Scholar) and Wu et al. (15Wu G.Y. Wilson J.M. Shalaby F. Grossman M. Shafritz D.A. Wu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14338-14342Google Scholar), was added to the ODNs (at a molar ratio of 25:1) with vigorous mixing. The solution was incubated at 4°C overnight and dialyzed (two times) against 0.15 M saline (1500:1; membrane Mr cutoff, 3500). The samples were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel using Tris/borate/EDTA buffer and then stained with ethidium bromide to visualize DNA. The samples were filtered through a 0.2-µm membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) before injection. Twenty-six male Japanese white rabbits weighing 2.0-2.5 kg were used in the experiment. All animals were housed individually, had free access to water, and were fed a standard rabbit chow supplement with 0.1% cholesterol for 10 weeks before and throughout the experiment. The plasma total and HDL cholesterol concentrations, which did not significantly change between the period after 9 and 10 weeks of feeding, were determined. Thirteen animals were injected with asialoglycoprotein-poly-L-lysine-antisense ODN complex, whereas the remaining 13 animals were injected with asialoglycoprotein-poly-L-lysine-sense ODN complex via the ear veins. The amount of ODNs injected was 30 µg/kg for each rabbit. At 6, 24, 48, and 96 h after injection, two rabbits in each group were killed, and liver specimens were taken. At the same time, about 1 ml of the blood was drawn from the remaining animals via their ear veins. Total RNA was isolated from the liver with a RNAzolB solution (Biotex, Friendswood, TX) according to the the manufacturer's procedure with slight modifications (12Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 11: 1759-1771Google Scholar). The abundance of CETP mRNA was determined by quantitative dot blotting (16Lin-Lee Y.C. Kao F.T. Cheung P. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3751-3756Google Scholar). The rabbit cRNA probe labeled with fluorescein-dUTP was produced by the nonradiolabeled, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Amersham Corp.), according to the rabbit sequence (11Nagashima M. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1643-1649Google Scholar). The sense and antisense primers used for PCR, the sizes of the PCR products, and the PCR cycles in each cRNA probe were: CETP, sense, 5′-CTTTCCATAAACTGCTCCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCTGGGTCTCCGCACTTTCT-3′; size, 482 base pairs; 30 cycles; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sense, 5′-ATGGTCTACATGTTCCAGTA-3′; antisense, 5′-TAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAGG-3′; size, 343 base pairs; 30 cycles. The plasma cholesterol concentrations were measured in whole plasma and in the HDL-containing supernatant after the precipitation of VLDL and LDL with dextran-Mg2+ using the Wako total and HDL cholesterol measuring kit (Wako Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The plasma constituents related to liver function were analyzed using an automatic analyzer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The CETP activity in the plasma was determined by a radioassay according to the modified method of Yen et al. (17Yen F.T. Deckelbaum R.J. Mann C.J. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 2018-2024Google Scholar). A volume of 20 µl of plasma was incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of [3H]cholesteryl oleate-labeled HDL (3-10 nmol CE) and an excessive amount of VLDL and LDL (0.2 µmol of CE). The volume was adjusted to 200 µl with Tris-saline (pH 7.4) before incubation. After the precipitation of VLDL and LDL by heparin and MnCl2 (18Warnick G.R. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 65-76Google Scholar), half of the supernatant volume was then removed and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. All values are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. The statistical analysis was performed by a paired t test for comparisons in the intragroup and by Student's t test for comparisons between the groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at a value of p < 0.05. We characterized the asialoglycoprotein-ODN complex by gel electrophoresis. The samples were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel using Tris/borate/EDTA buffer and then were stained with ethidium bromide to visualize DNA (Fig. 1). The ODNs were retained by the asialoglycoprotein-poly-L-lysine conjugate in the well, whereas ODNs alone entered the gel. In the rabbits injected with antisense ODNs, the total cholesterol concentrations and the CETP activities were all significantly decreased at 24, 48, and 96 h compared with those at 0 h. At 48 h, the total cholesterol concentrations and the CETP activities were also significantly lower in the rabbits injected with antisense ODNs than in those injected with sense ODNs (Fig. 2). The HDL cholesterol concentrations significantly increased at 48 h compared with those at 0 h and the rabbits injected with sense ODNs (Fig. 2). In the rabbits injected with sense ODNs, the total and HDL cholesterol concentrations and the CETP activities did not significantly change throughout the experiment (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows a typical example of the dot blot analyses of hepatic CETP mRNA treated with antisense ODNs. A reduction of hepatic CETP mRNA was observed at 6, 24, and 48 h after injection with antisense ODNs. When the amount of hepatic CETP mRNA was measured by scanning and expressed as a ratio to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, the mean values were 0.83 (100%) at 0 h, 0.43 (51.8%) at 6 h, 0.40 (48.2%) at 24 h, 0.65 (78.3%) at 48 h, and 0.87 (104.8%) at 96 h (the parentheses express the percentages against the value at 0 h). Hepatic CETP mRNA treated with sense ODNs did not change throughout the experimental period (data not shown). We measured the plasma constituents related to liver function (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase γ-GTP, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), including triglyceride in the rabbits (data not shown). These levels did not significantly change throughout the experimental period and were also not significantly different between the animals injected with sense and antisense ODNs.Fig. 2Changes in the plasma cholesterol concentrations and plasma CETP activities.

The antisense ODNs used in the present study demonstrated no side effects within 4 days after injection. The antisense ODNs are widely used as inhibitors of specific gene expression because they offer the possibility of blocking the expression of a particular gene without any changes in the functions of other genes (19Helene C. Toulme J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 99-125Google Scholar). However, for successful antisense delivery, some criteria must be fulfilled (19Helene C. Toulme J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 99-125Google Scholar, 20Stein C.A. Cheng Y.-C. Science. 1993; 261: 1004-1012Google Scholar, 21Piwnica-Worms D. J. Nucl. Med. 1994; 35: 1064-1066Google Scholar). Recently, an efficient gene transfer method mediated by a viral liposome complex has been used as a delivery system of antisense ODNs in vivo (22Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Ellison K.E. Nakajima M. Zang L. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8474-8478Google Scholar, 23Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Ellison K.E. Nakajima M. Leyen H.V.L. Zang L. Kaneda Y.

Hypertension. 1995; 26: 131-136Google Scholar). However, to use the methods mentioned above, many technical and methodological difficulties still need to be overcome in comparison with those in our study, and such gene targeting is also troublesome to use in chronic clinical situations, such as in the treatment of atherosclerosis. Regarding lipoprotein metabolism, almost all enzymes and apolipoproteins are produced in the liver; therefore, the efficient receptor-mediated delivery of antisense ODNs to the liver in vivo used in our study may be useful for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications for lipoprotein metabolism. In our study, the total cholesterol concentrations and the CETP activities were all significantly decreased at 24, 48, and 96 h, whereas the HDL cholesterol concentrations significantly increased only at 48 h compared with those at 0 h. At 48 h, the total cholesterol decreased substantially more than the HDL cholesterol increased (Fig. 2). Although we could not conclusively clarify the exact reason for these results, the following factors are considered to play a role. The assay used for the CETP activity in this study cannot always show the true CE mass transfer in vivo, because the assay uses exogenous lipoprotein substrates added in the assay, whereas in vivo the CE is transferred among the endogenous lipoproteins of plasma (25Mann C.J. Yen F.T. Grant A.M. Bihain B.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2059-2066Google Scholar). This may partly explain why the CETP activity is still significantly reduced at 96 h, whereas the HDL cholesterol levels returned to normal. It has been reported that there is an inverse relationship between the plasma CETP and liver LDL receptor mRNA in CETP transgenic mice (26Jiang X.C. Masucci-Magoulas L. Mar J. Lin M. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27406-27412Google Scholar). The induced LDL receptor expression in LDL receptor transgenic mice leads to a marked reduction in plasma VLDL and LDL (27Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Google Scholar), possibly because approximately 50-80% of VLDL and/or LDL is cleared by hepatocytes, due to LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis (28Spady D.K. Bilheimer D.W. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3499-3503Google Scholar, 29Spady D.K. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 465-472Google Scholar). LDL receptor protein and activity are generally parallel to LDL receptor mRNA levels (27Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Google Scholar). It is also indicated that the reduction of plasma CETP reduces the plasma levels of LDL and VLDL cholesterol possibly by enhancing LDL catabolism (7Ikewaki K. Nishiwaki M. Sakamoto T. Ishikawa T. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Nagano M. Nakamura H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1573-1581Google Scholar) and possibly by decreasing the transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins (1Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 361-367Google Scholar, 2Hesler C.B. Swenson T.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2275-2282Google Scholar), and it also increases the plasma level of HDL cholesterol, possibly due to the latter reason. Since normal rabbits have a large degree of CETP activity (30Ha Y.C. Barter P.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 71B: 265-269Google Scholar), and the LDL receptor is down-regulated, and CETP mRNA in the liver and plasma CETP increase especially in the rabbits fed an atherogenic diet more than in those fed a standard diet (10Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B. Kroon P.A. Marcel Y.L. Lee Y.C. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 357-363Google Scholar), the inhibition of CETP by antisense ODNs in our study may thus affect not only the decrease in CETP but also the increase in the LDL receptor much more than other models. Thus, as a result, the VLDL and LDL cholesterol levels might be reduced more than the HDL level was increased. Our antisense injection was considered successful for the following reasons: (a) the asialoglycoprotein-poly-L-lysine-antisense complex is rapidly and preferentially taken up by the liver (13Lu X.M. Fischman A.J. Jyawook S.L. Hendricks K. Tompkins R.G. Yarmush M.L. J. Nucl. Med. 1994; 35: 269-275Google Scholar) and has enhanced resistance to nuclease degradation in plasma (31Chiou H.C. Tangco M.V. Levine S.M. Robertson D. Kormis K. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5439-5446Google Scholar); (b) the amount of CETP mRNA in the liver is thought to be relatively low compared with other lipoprotein mRNAs in the liver; however, these findings have only been previously seen in the cynomolgus monkey (12Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 11: 1759-1771Google Scholar); and (c) the liver is the major tissue responsible for the production of CETP (CETP mRNA) in rabbits (10Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B. Kroon P.A. Marcel Y.L. Lee Y.C. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 357-363Google Scholar, 11Nagashima M. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1643-1649Google Scholar) (although adipose tissue may also be found in monkeys (12Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 11: 1759-1771Google Scholar)). The exact role of CETP in the development of atherosclerosis has yet to be clarified. Marotti et al. (9Marotti K.R. Castle C.K. Boyle T.P. Lin A.H. Murray R.W. Melchior G.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 73-75Google Scholar) demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing cynomolgus monkey CETP had significantly more early atherosclerotic lesions in the proximal aorta than controls when fed a high cholesterol diet. On the other hand, more recently Hayek et al. (32Hayek T. Masucci-Magoulas L. Jiang X. Walsh A. Rubin E. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2071-2074Google Scholar) concluded that CETP expression inhibited the development of early atherosclerotic lesions in hypertriglyceridemic mice. The CETP expression in hypertriglyceridemic animals produced a much greater reduction in the HDL size (33Hayek T. Chajek-Shaul T. Walsh A. Agellon L.B. Moulin P. Tall A.R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 505-510Google Scholar). These small particles, which can be produced by CETP (34Sugano M. Shah R. Rudel L.L. Circulation. 1991; 84 (a (abstr.)): 378Google Scholar), may thus be an optimal mediator of cellular cholesterol efflux (35Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Google Scholar). In conclusion, in this study we have shown that the intravenous administration of the asialoglycoprotein-poly-L-lysine-antisense complex is a beneficial method for reducing the plasma levels of LDL and VLDL cholesterol and increasing the plasma level of HDL cholesterol, possibly by enhancing LDL catabolism (7Ikewaki K. Nishiwaki M. Sakamoto T. Ishikawa T. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Nagano M. Nakamura H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1573-1581Google Scholar) and decreasing the transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins (1Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 361-367Google Scholar, 2Hesler C.B. Swenson T.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2275-2282Google Scholar). However, it must be mentioned that our results were limited to the period comprising only several days after the injection. Therefore, to elucidate the exact effect of CETP on atherosclerosis development, further longer term studies are called for.

This process occurs with high accuracy, less than 10−9 to 10−10 errors being committed per base pair per round of replication. As a first step in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the high fidelity of this process, we have purified the polymerase III α catalytic subunit, free of exonuclease activity, and analyzed its fidelity in vitro. We employed a newly developed gap-filling assay using the N-terminal 250 bases of the lacI gene as a forward mutational target. When synthesizing across this target, α subunit produced mutations at a frequency of 0.6%. DNA sequencing revealed that the mutants created in vitro consisted mostly of frameshift mutations, although some base substitutions were also observed. The frameshifts, occurring at more than 120-fold above the background, consisted largely of −1 deletions. Among them, about 80% were the deletion of a purine template base with a pyrimidine 5′-neighbor. These results suggest that the α subunit (i) has a relatively low ability to extend from misincorporated bases, accounting for the low level of observed base substitutions, and (ii) has a relatively high capability of extension after misalignment of a misincorporated base on the next (complementary) template base, accounting for the high level of frameshift mutations. This model is supported by an experiment in which α subunit was required to initiate DNA synthesis from a terminal mispair in a sequence context that allowed slippage on the next template base. Among the products of this reaction, frameshifts outnumbered base pair substitutions by greater than 70-fold. A comparison to in vivo mutational spectra suggests that the pol III accessory factors may play a major role in modulating the fidelity of DNA synthesis.

A comparison to in vivo mutational spectra suggests that the pol III accessory factors may play a major role in modulating the fidelity of DNA synthesis. DNA replication in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms is a highly accurate process, only one error being committed per 109 to 1010 nucleotides incorporated (1Drake J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7160-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). This high fidelity of DNA replication is achieved by at least three critical steps (reviewed in Refs. 2Echols H.A. Lu C. Burgers P.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2189-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and 3Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): (i) the insertion fidelity of the DNA polymerase, which selects correct over incorrect nucleotides via template-directed discrimination, (ii) the 3′→ 5′ (proofreading) exonuclease of the DNA polymerase, which removes incorrectly inserted bases before DNA synthesis continues; and (iii) postreplicative DNA mismatch repair, which corrects errors resulting from DNA replication errors by incising the newly synthesized strand. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is the main enzyme responsible for replication of the Escherichia coli chromosome, including the high fidelity of this process (4McHenry C.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 165Google Scholar, 6Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is a dimeric polymerase that simultaneously replicates the leading and lagging strands (4McHenry C.S. Annu. Rev.

It consists of 10 different subunits, α, ε, θ, τ, γ, δ, δ′, χ, ψ, and β with a presumed overall composition (αεθ)2τ2(γ2δδ′χψ)β4 (6Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The tightly bound α, ε, and θ subunits form the pol III core. The α subunit, encoded by the dnaE gene, is the catalytic DNA polymerization subunit (8Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ε subunit, encoded by the dnaQ gene, provides the 3′→ 5′ proofreading activity (9Scheuermann R. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7747-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The function of the θ subunit is as yet unknown. The fine structure and dynamics of the pol III holoenzyme are under active investigation (6Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Postreplication DNA mismatch repair is performed by the mutH, mutL, mutS, and mutU gene products (see Ref. 10Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, for review). The relative contributions of base selection, proofreading, and DNA mismatch repair to in vivo fidelity have been estimated from mutant frequencies and sequenced mutation spectra in strains defective in the respective pathways (3Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schaaper R.M. Dunn R.L. Genetics. 1991; 129: 317-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, using mismatch repair-defective strains, it was estimated that pol III holoenzyme replicates DNA at an average accuracy of 10−7 errors per base pair per round of replication, of which proofreading may contribute an approximate factor of 10−2 (3Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fijalkowska I.J. Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Postreplicative mismatch repair improves overall fidelity by 200- to 300-fold (3Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schaaper R.M. Dunn R.L. Genetics. 1991; 129: 317-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielding the final mutation rate of 10−9 to 10−10. To gain insights into the mechanisms by which pol III holoenzyme achieves its high fidelity, we have initiated an in vitro investigation of its fidelity. Despite the fact that this enzyme is one of the best characterized replication complexes, its fidelity has not been studied in detail (13Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4251-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Sloane D.L. Goodman M.F. Echols H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6465-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Carraway M. Rewinski C. Marinus M.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1645-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the current study, we focus on the simplest unit, the α catalytic subunit. One previous study on the fidelity of α subunit has been reported, in which steady-state kinetic assays at a limited number of nucleotide sites were performed to determine nucleotide misincorporation rates by this enzyme (14Sloane D.L. Goodman M.F. Echols H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6465-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we analyze the fidelity of α subunit using a newly developed in vitro forward mutation assay that uses the N-terminal region of the lacI gene as a sequence target. This target allows a variety of mutations to be recovered, including base substitutions, frameshifts, deletions, and duplications. We show that in this assay α subunit produces relatively few base pair substitutions, but a high level of single-base frameshift mutations. The implications of these findings for the overall fidelity mechanism used by pol III holoenzyme are discussed.

Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and shaking was continued for another 4 h. A total of 8 liters of the induced cells were spun down and resuspended in 50 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, and 8 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1.8 mg/ml. Lysis was achieved by incubating the suspension at 37°C for 7 min and then on ice for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.25 g/ml followed by stirring for 30 min. The precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 20% glycerol. The resuspension was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A for 16 h with two changes. It was then loaded onto a HiTrap-Heparin column (bed volume, 5 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A. Protein was eluted with 50 ml of buffer A containing a linear gradient (0-0.4 M) of NaCl at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Peak fractions from two separate batches of HiTrap-Heparin chromatography were pooled and applied to a FPLC Mono Q 5/5 HR column (bed volume, 1 ml). The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of buffer A. Protein was eluted with 20 ml of buffer A containing a linear gradient (20-400 mM) NaCl at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 150 µl by a Centricon 30 (30,000 Mr cut-off) centrifugal microconcentrator and then gel-filtered through an FPLC Superose 12 column (HR 10/30) equilibrated with buffer A containing 500 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min. All operations were done at 0-4°C. Polymerase activity assays (see Other Methods) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to monitor α subunit during the purification. A 5′-32P-labeled 15-mer oligonucleotide was annealed to M13mp2 single-stranded DNA to generate a mismatched substrate with an A(template)·G 3′-terminal mispair. The oligonucleotide was complementary to nucleotides 106-119 of the lacZα gene with the A·G mispair located at position 105. Annealing was done in 150 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium citrate, by heating the mixture at 70°C for 10 min and then allowing it to cool down to room temperature. The DNA:oligonucleotide ratio was 1.5 to 1. Following hybridization, the product was purified through a Sephadex G-50 column. Exonuclease reactions (25 µl final volume) were started by adding 10 pmol of α subunit or 12 pmol of pol I Klenow fragment into a mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, and 300 ng of terminally-mismatched DNA. After incubation at 30°C for 10 and 60 min, 5-µl aliquots were removed and mixed with stop solution (20 mM EDTA, 95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF). The sample was then run on a 20% polyacrylamide-6 M urea gel and analyzed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Exonuclease activity was calculated as the rate of disappearance of the starting 15-mer. Gapped molecules were prepared essentially according to the method described by Kunkel and Soni (20Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RF I DNA of phage mRS65 was isolated by Qiagen column. The double-stranded DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases MluI and SphI, which cut at positions −60 and +379 of lacI, respectively, producing two fragments of size 439 and 8040 base pairs (bp). The 8040-bp fragment was separated from the small fragment by PEG precipitation using 6.5% PEG-8000 in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Using these conditions, the 8040-bp preparation does not contain detectable 439-bp fragment. 0.38 pmol of 8040-bp fragment in TE buffer were heated at 70°C for 5 min; 0.25 pmol of single-stranded circular mRS65 DNA were added, and heating was continued for another 2 min. NaCl and sodium citrate (20 × SSC) were added to a final concentration of 30 mM, and heating continued at 65°C for 5 min. The product was desalted using a Microcon-30 centrifugation device and analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis. The gapped DNA obtained through this procedure did not contain detectable single-stranded DNA. α subunit from Superose fractions 35 and 36 (see Fig. 2) was used for gap-filling assays. Reactions were initiated by addition of α subunit to a mixture (total volume, 25 µl) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM each of the four dNTPs and 60 fmol of gapped DNA. For the gap-filling reaction with mp2 DNAs, 28 pmol of α subunit were added. For gap-filling reaction with mRS65 DNA, 5.4 pmol of α subunit was used. The reaction was run at 30°C for 1 h and terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 15 mM. A portion of the reaction mixture was run on an 0.8% agarose gel to confirm completeness of gap-filling. Another portion of the reaction mixture was diluted in sterile water and transfected into competent cells of strain MC1061 by electroporation. Competent cells were prepared as described (21Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of transfected cells was mixed with 3 ml of soft agar containing 2.5 mg of X-gal and 0.5 ml of indicator strain NR9099 and plated on minimal medium plates (20Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Mutants were scored as colorless (or light-blue) plaques in case of mp2 DNA and as (light and dark) blue plaques in case of mp2A89, mp2(+T70), and mRS65. The mutant frequency was calculated by dividing the number of mutant plaques by the total number of plaques. The error rate per nucleotide polymerized in the lacI target was calculated by dividing the mutant frequency (after subtraction of the control frequency) by 0.55 (the average −-strand expression factor, see legend to Fig. 3) and then by the approximate number of nucleotides in the target (220 for the combined mutations or the frameshift mutations and 100 for base pair substitutions).Fig. 3The mRS65 gap-filling assay system. The gap located in the 5′-region of the lacI gene is 439 nucleotides long between positions −60 and +379 of lacI, numbered according to Farabaugh (27Farabaugh P.J. Nature. 1978; 274: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The gap contains the lacI promoter region and the first 379 nucleotides of the lacI gene. Gap-filling synthesis proceeds from right to left. The dashed square represents E. coli competent cells. The expression of (−)-strand errors in this system as determined by heteroduplex experiments (20Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol.

The gapped primer template (gap size 366 nucleotides) contained a 3′-terminal T(template)·C mismatch at position 103 of the lacZα gene (20Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol.

DNA synthesis by α subunit (10.8 pmol) or by E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (exo−) (0.5 unit) was performed as described for gap-filling assays, above. The product DNA was electroporated into strain MC1061, followed by plating on strain CSH50 in the presence of X-gal and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and scoring for plaque-color phenotype (dark-blue, light-blue, or colorless) (22Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase assays used to monitor α subunit during purification were done using poly(dA)/(oligo(dT) as template-primer (150 µM as nucleotide, dA:dT = 2:1) as described (23Maki H. Mo J.Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5055-5061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of polymerase activity is defined as the amount that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 pmol of dTMP per min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done as described (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Isolation of single- and double-stranded DNA was done by a published method (25Del Sal G. Manfioletti G. Schneider C. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 514-519PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of mRS65 mutants containing a mutation in the lacI gene was performed as described (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar), using an 18-mer primer complementary to positions 259 to 276 of lacI (27Farabaugh P.J. Nature. 1978; 274: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Mutations were recorded when residing in the region between position +30 and +250 (3Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Farabaugh P.J. Nature. 1978; 274: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase III α subunit was purified from strain JM109 harboring the dnaE-overexpressing plasmid pDNAE OPI. From 8 liters of culture we obtained 1.5 mg of α subunit. The protein was judged to be pure (>95%) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) and silver staining (not shown). The specific activity was 4.5 × 106 units/mg of protein, a value comparable to those published by others (8Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since our primary goal was to perform in vitro fidelity assays with the purified α subunit, it was important to establish the level of 3′-exonuclease activity in the preparation. Contaminating exonuclease might function as a proofreader and reduce the number of observable polymerase errors. Exonuclease activity was examined using a 3′-terminally mismatched DNA substrate. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2). After a 10-min incubation, no detectable exonuclease activity was observed in any of the peak fractions of the final gel filtration column. In contrast, the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I used as a positive control degraded almost half of the substrate in this time period. After a 1-h incubation, there was a trace of exonuclease activity in fractions 30 and 31. The activity in these two fractions was about 1/5000 of the activity in Klenow polymerase. Exonuclease activity in fractions 32-36 was still not detectable after a 1-h incubation. α Subunit from fractions 35 and 36 was used for gap-filling assays (see below). To determine the fidelity of DNA synthesis by the α subunits, we first used the M13mp2 mutation assay system described by Kunkel (16Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5787-5796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kunkel and Soni (20Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This system uses a double-stranded M13mp2 DNA molecule containing a 361-nucleotide gap across the lacZα gene required for α-complementation. The accuracy of gap-filling DNA synthesis is monitored by transfecting the completed DNA and plating on an α-complementation host. Two versions of the M13mp2 system exist. In the forward assay, the gap contains the lacZα+ gene, and polymerase errors throughout the target are scored as lacZα− mutants (colorless or light-blue plaques among the parental dark-blue plaques). In the reversion assay, the gap contains a defined lacZ mutation, and DNA polymerase errors at (or near) the site of mutation are scored as lacZα+ plaques (blue plaques among parental white plaques). The α subunit was capable of filling the 361-nucleotide gap across the lacZα gene, although a large molar excess of enzyme over template (>400:1) was required. Using the forward assay, the mutant frequency for α subunit was 30 × 10−4, 7-fold above the background level (Table I). We also examined the fidelity using two different reversion systems. Phage mp2A89 contains a G to A substitution in position 89 of lacZα, resulting in a TGA termination codon, and reversion can take place by any base-substitution error changing the termination codon into a sense codon (20Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this assay, the reversion frequency was essentially at background level (Table I). We also measured the frameshift fidelity using mp2(+T70), which has an extra T added to a TTTT run at positions 70-73 of lacZα, abolishing α-complementation (28Kunkel T.A. Hamatake R.K. Motto-Fox J. Fitzgerald M.P. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4447-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reversion takes place by (−1) frameshift mutation at the 5 Ts or in a limited region around it (28Kunkel T.A. Hamatake R.K. Motto-Fox J. Fitzgerald M.P. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4447-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Table I shows that reversion frequency was about 30-fold above the background. The results suggest that the α subunit is quite accurate for base substitutions, but relatively inaccurate for frameshift mutations.

Cyclic adenosine 5′-diphosphate ribose (cADPR), a metabolite of β-NAD+, has been reported to increase [Ca2+]i in pancreatic β-cells by releasing Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-insensitive intracellular stores. In the present study, we have examined the role of cADPR in glucose-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i and insulin exocytosis. Dispersed ob/ob mouse β-cell aggregates were either pressure microinjected with fura-2 salt or loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, and [Ca2+]i was monitored by microfluorimetry. Microinjection of β-NAD+ into fura-2-loaded β-cells did not increase [Ca2+]i nor did it alter the cells' subsequent [Ca2+]i response to glucose. Cells microinjected with the cADPR antagonist 8NH2-cADPR increased [Ca2+]i in response to glucose equally well as those injected with cADPR. Finally, the ability of cADPR to promote exocytosis of insulin in electropermeabilized β-cells was investigated. cADPR on its own did not increase insulin secretion nor did it potentiate Ca2+-induced insulin secretion. We conclude that cADPR neither plays a significant role in glucose-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i nor interacts directly with the molecular mechanisms regulating exocytosis of insulin in normal pancreatic β-cells.

https://openalex.org/W1997731285,"Ca2+ transport by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is tightly coupled with the enzymatic activity of Ca2+-dependent ATPase, which forms and decomposes an intermediate phosphoenzyme. Heart sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phospholamban phosphorylation, which results in a stimulation of the initial rates of Ca2+ transport and Ca2+ ATPase activity. In the present studies we found that acylphosphatase from heart muscle, used at concentrations within the physiological range, actively hydrolyzes the phosphoenzyme of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, with an apparent Km on the order of 10(-7) M, suggesting an high affinity of the enzyme for this special substrate. In unphosphorylated vesicles acylphosphatase enhanced the rate of ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ uptake with a concomitant significant decrease in apparent Km for Ca2+ and ATP. In vesicles whose phospholamban was PKA-phosphorylated, acylphosphatase also stimulated the rate of Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis but to a lesser extent, and the Km values for Ca2+ and ATP were not significantly different with respect to those found in the absence of acylphosphatase. These findings suggest that acylphosphatase, owing to its hydrolytic effect, accelerates the turnover of the phosphoenzyme intermediate with the consequence of an enhanced activity of Ca2+ pump. It is known that phosphorylation of phospholamban results in an increase of the rate at which the phosphoenzyme is decomposed. Thus, as discussed, a competition between phospholamban and acylphosphatase effect on the phosphoenzyme might be proposed to explain why the stimulation induced by this enzyme is less marked in PKA-phosphorylated than in unphosphorylated heart vesicles."

We used electrophoretic mobility shift methods to study the effects of mtSSB on primer-template recognition by DNA pol γ. Preliminary experiments showed that single mtSSB tetramers bind tightly to oligo(dT) single strands containing 32 to 48 residues.

Association of mtSSB with the 5′-dT40-tail in the 18:71-mer primer-template reduced the binding of DNA polymerase γ and the efficiency of primer extension. Binding of mtSSB to single-stranded DNA was also observed to block the action of the 3′→5′ exonuclease of DNA polymerase γ.

INTRODUCTIONSingle-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSB) 1The abbreviations used are: SSBsingle-stranded bindingpolpolymeraseDTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albumin. comprise a group of proteins which bind preferentially and with high affinity to single-stranded DNA. SSB proteins are present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and are assumed to be essential for DNA metabolism in all organisms. One of the best characterized prokaryotic SSBs, Escherichia coli SSB, is a stable homotetramer of subunits containing 177 amino acids (18.8 kDa). Both biochemical and genetic data indicate that E. coli SSB is involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination (1Meyer R. Laine P. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 342-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the ionic conditions this protein binds to DNA in multiple modes with an apparent binding site size varying from 35 to 56 or 65 nucleotides (2Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Trends Biol. Sci. 1988; 13: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lohman T. Ferrari M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes contain two different families of nuclear and mitochondrial SSB proteins. Heterotrimeric nuclear SSBs (RPA) (subunits of about 70, 32, and 14 kDa) have been found in all eukaryotic cells examined. These proteins are essential for replication, are involved in recombination and repair, and interact specifically with other proteins involved in DNA metabolism although they have little sequence homology with prokaryotic SSBs (4Dornreiter I. Erdile L. Gilbert I. von Winkler D. Kelly T. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).Mitochondrial SSBs have been isolated from Xenopus laevis oocytes (5Mignotte B. Barat M. Mounolou J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1703-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), rat liver (6Pavco P.A. Van Tuyle G.C. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two Xenopus mtSSBs have been described. One of these, mtSSB-1 has been fully sequenced (10Ghrir R. Lecaer J.P. Dufresne C. Gueride M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and is represented in a full-length cDNA clone (11Tiranti V. Barat-Gueride B. Bijl J. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The second, mtSSB-2, has not been cloned and has been only partially sequenced. The first 80 residues of mtSSB-2 reveal 91% identity to mtSSB-1, which contains 129 amino acids (14.6 kDa). Both Xenopus (12Mahoungou C. Ghrir R. Lecaer J. Mignotte B. Barat-Gueride M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and human (13Curth U. Urbanke C. Greipel J. Gerberding H. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) mtSSB form tetramers in solution. mtSSB sequences share similarity to the N-terminal portion of E. coli SSB (11Tiranti V. Barat-Gueride B. Bijl J. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Stroumbakis N. Li Z. Tolias P.

In particular, Xenopus mtSSB-1 is 30% identical to the first 129 residues of E. coli SSB. However, sequence differences account for a dramatic difference in overall charge of these two proteins. Xl-mtSSB-1 has a pI of 9.92 while E. coli SSB has a pI of 5.23.The putative biological function of mtSSB is to stabilize single-stranded regions of mtDNA in D-loop structures and other replicative intermediates (7VanTuyle G.C. Pavco P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The binding of various mtSSBs to single-stranded DNA has been studied using spectrophotometric methods. A binding site size of 8 or 9 nucleotides per monomer was estimated using fluorescence quench titration with poly(dT) for mtSSB from rat liver (17Hoke G.D. Pavco P.A. Ledwith B.J. Van Tuyle G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A higher value for the binding site size, 59 nucleotides per tetramer, was obtained by fluorescence titration of human mtSSB at salt concentrations between 0.05 and 2 M NaCl (13Curth U. Urbanke C. Greipel J. Gerberding H. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, Thommes et al. (9Thommes P. Farr C. Marton R. Kaguni L. Cotterill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have used the fluorescence quench titration method to measure a binding site size on M13 DNA of 17 bases per monomer for Drosophila mtSSB.The Saccharomyces cerevisiae mtSSB product of the rim1 gene is required for maintenance of mtDNA (8Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Similar genetic evidence of an essential role for mtSSB is not available in other organisms. Nevertheless, mtSSB may interact with many proteins and enzymes participating in mtDNA replication, transcription, and repair. However, only a few biological effects of mtSSB have been documented to date. In vitro experiments showed that mtSSB isolated from X. laevis oocytes, Drosophila melanogaster, rat liver, and cultured human cells stimulates the activity of homologous DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) on some DNA primer-templates (9Thommes P.

Barat-Gueride M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). E. coli SSB can also stimulate replication by Drosophila pol γ (20Williams A. Kaguni L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Despite results suggesting that mtSSB may interact with DNA pol γ, no data have been published on details of the interaction of DNA pol γ with a primer-template complex associated with mtSSB. Since DNA pol γ is not available in the quantities required for physical chemical methods, such experiments would require methods that utilize relatively small quantities of protein. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to study the interaction between DNA pol γ and mtSSB. First, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to study the interaction of Xenopus mtSSB with oligonucleotides. We then expanded this study to investigate the effects of binding of mtSSB on the interaction of DNA pol γ with single-stranded oligonucleotides and primer-template complexes. In the absence of Mg2+ ions, pol γ forms stable primer-dependent complexes with oligonucleotides in either the presence or absence of mtSSB. The data suggest that an mtSSB tetramer bound to the template adjacent to the 3′-end of a primer does not increase the binding affinity of pol γ for the primer-template. Second, we studied the ability of mtSSB to protect oligonucleotides against the 3′→5′ exonucleolytic activity of DNA pol γ. This approach shows that increasing the ionic strength increases the apparent binding site size for mitochondrial SSB.

Depending on the ionic conditions this protein binds to DNA in multiple modes with an apparent binding site size varying from 35 to 56 or 65 nucleotides (2Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Overman L.B.

Eukaryotes contain two different families of nuclear and mitochondrial SSB proteins. Heterotrimeric nuclear SSBs (RPA) (subunits of about 70, 32, and 14 kDa) have been found in all eukaryotic cells examined. These proteins are essential for replication, are involved in recombination and repair, and interact specifically with other proteins involved in DNA metabolism although they have little sequence homology with prokaryotic SSBs (4Dornreiter I. Erdile L. Gilbert I. von Winkler D. Kelly T. Fanning E.

The first 80 residues of mtSSB-2 reveal 91% identity to mtSSB-1, which contains 129 amino acids (14.6 kDa). Both Xenopus (12Mahoungou C. Ghrir R. Lecaer J. Mignotte B. Barat-Gueride M.

In particular, Xenopus mtSSB-1 is 30% identical to the first 129 residues of E. coli SSB. However, sequence differences account for a dramatic difference in overall charge of these two proteins. Xl-mtSSB-1 has a pI of 9.92 while E. coli SSB has a pI of 5.23.The putative biological function of mtSSB is to stabilize single-stranded regions of mtDNA in D-loop structures and other replicative intermediates (7VanTuyle G.C. Pavco P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The binding of various mtSSBs to single-stranded DNA has been studied using spectrophotometric methods. A binding site size of 8 or 9 nucleotides per monomer was estimated using fluorescence quench titration with poly(dT) for mtSSB from rat liver (17Hoke G.D. Pavco P.A. Ledwith B.J. Van Tuyle G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A higher value for the binding site size, 59 nucleotides per tetramer, was obtained by fluorescence titration of human mtSSB at salt concentrations between 0.05 and 2 M NaCl (13Curth U. Urbanke C. Greipel J. Gerberding H. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, Thommes et al. (9Thommes P. Farr C. Marton R. Kaguni L. Cotterill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have used the fluorescence quench titration method to measure a binding site size on M13 DNA of 17 bases per monomer for Drosophila mtSSB.The Saccharomyces cerevisiae mtSSB product of the rim1 gene is required for maintenance of mtDNA (8Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Similar genetic evidence of an essential role for mtSSB is not available in other organisms. Nevertheless, mtSSB may interact with many proteins and enzymes participating in mtDNA replication, transcription, and repair. However, only a few biological effects of mtSSB have been documented to date. In vitro experiments showed that mtSSB isolated from X. laevis oocytes, Drosophila melanogaster, rat liver, and cultured human cells stimulates the activity of homologous DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) on some DNA primer-templates (9Thommes P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Despite results suggesting that mtSSB may interact with DNA pol γ, no data have been published on details of the interaction of DNA pol γ with a primer-template complex associated with mtSSB. Since DNA pol γ is not available in the quantities required for physical chemical methods, such experiments would require methods that utilize relatively small quantities of protein. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to study the interaction between DNA pol γ and mtSSB. First, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to study the interaction of Xenopus mtSSB with oligonucleotides. We then expanded this study to investigate the effects of binding of mtSSB on the interaction of DNA pol γ with single-stranded oligonucleotides and primer-template complexes. In the absence of Mg2+ ions, pol γ forms stable primer-dependent complexes with oligonucleotides in either the presence or absence of mtSSB. The data suggest that an mtSSB tetramer bound to the template adjacent to the 3′-end of a primer does not increase the binding affinity of pol γ for the primer-template. Second, we studied the ability of mtSSB to protect oligonucleotides against the 3′→5′ exonucleolytic activity of DNA pol γ. This approach shows that increasing the ionic strength increases the apparent binding site size for mitochondrial SSB. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSB) 1The abbreviations used are: SSBsingle-stranded bindingpolpolymeraseDTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albumin. comprise a group of proteins which bind preferentially and with high affinity to single-stranded DNA. SSB proteins are present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and are assumed to be essential for DNA metabolism in all organisms. One of the best characterized prokaryotic SSBs, Escherichia coli SSB, is a stable homotetramer of subunits containing 177 amino acids (18.8 kDa).

https://openalex.org/W2046129883,"Reactive oxygen species of mitochondrial origin have been implicated in regulating the expression of several tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced genes. Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is one of many genes, but only antioxidant enzyme, induced in response to tumor necrosis factor. Mn-SOD is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix protein and serves a protective function by detoxifying superoxide. To address the role of superoxide in regulating gene expression in response to TNF, we have constitutively overexpressed Mn-SOD in a human fibrosarcoma cell line and asked what effect this has on the expression of a number of TNF-responsive genes using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Of the TNF-induced transcripts analyzed, only interleukin-1α (IL-1α) was modulated in response to Mn-SOD overexpression. In all cases of Mn-SOD overexpression, IL-1α protein and mRNA levels were lowered constitutively and in response to TNF when compared to the parental and mock-transfected cell lines. The induction of IL-1α by TNF can also be decreased by growth in 3% oxygen as compared to growth in 21% O2; in addition, growth in low oxygen lowers the basal level of IL-1α protein. The effect of Mn-SOD overexpression on IL-1α expression can be overcome by treatment with the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Mn-SOD overexpression and low oxygen alter IL-1α mRNA levels by decreasing the stability of the IL-1α mRNA. These findings indicate that both Mn-SOD and O2 may regulate the levels of a cellular oxidant involved in both basal and TNF-induced IL-1α expression, presumably superoxide.

Adv. Enzymol. 1987; 58: 61-97Google Scholar). The strategic localization of this enzyme in mitochondria allows it to be readily available for removal of superoxide generated via leakage of electrons from the mitochondrial respiratory chain (2Boveris A.

Superoxide is a highly reactive oxygen radical, which is capable of directly or indirectly oxidizing protein, lipids, and nucleic acids. Thus, superoxide has been implicated as an important pathologic mediator in various disorders including cancer (4Ames B.N. Mutat.

Mn-SOD serves a protective role by detoxifying O2 and preventing superoxide-mediated damage to the mitochondria.

The pathway leading to TNF-mediated activation of NFκB has been shown to require oxygen-derived radicals of mitochondrial origin (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakkers A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to investigate what role Mn-SOD may play in regulating the levels of these oxygen-derived signal molecules of mitochondrial origin. Human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells were cultured in Minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were treated with recombinant human TNF (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or cycloheximide (Sigma). The vector pRC/CMV was purchased from Invitrogen. The plasmid pGEM/Mn-SOD, which contains a full-length Mn-SOD cDNA (27Beck Y. Oren R. Amit B. Levanon A. Gorecki M. Hartman J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was a gift of Dr. David Goeddel (Genentech). The pRC/CMV was digested with HindIII, and the ends were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The Mn-SOD cDNA was excised with EcoRI and HindIII and the ends were filled in. The 760-base pair cDNA was then inserted into the SmaI site of the pRC/CMV expression vector to obtain pRC/Mn-SOD expression vectors with the cDNA insert in either sense or antisense orientation. Restriction digests revealed the orientation of the Mn-SOD cDNA in the vector. Construction of the pCAT1.8 vector was performed by inserting the IL-1α 1.8-kilobase pair PCR-amplified genomic DNA fragment into the SalI site of the pCATBASIC vector (Promega) upstream of the CAT reporter gene. The 1.8-kilobase pair fragment comprised a region from position 297 to 2126 of known sequence for the human IL-1α gene (accession number X03833). The IL-1α insert and orientation was confirmed by restriction digest, Southern blotting, and DNA sequencing. HT-1080 cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 2 µg of pRC/Mn-SOD (sense or antisense) were mixed with 30 µg of Lipofectin in a total volume of 80 µl and incubated at room temperature for 5 min; 720 µl of minimal essential medium minus serum was added before transferring to a single well of a six-well cluster plate containing ~70% confluent HT-1080 cells. After 4 h, 1.2 ml of minimal essential medium supplemented with 3.3% calf serum was added. The next day, the cells were transferred to a 75-cm2 flask. Selection with 1 mg/ml of G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.) was started the next day. After 10 days, resistant cells were harvested and approximately 100 cells were plated in a 75-cm2 flask. The cells were allowed to grow until visible colonies were observed. Single colonies were then picked up and transferred to 24-well culture plates. This cloning protocol has been described previously (28Waldman A.S. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 138Google Scholar). After cloning, cells were cultured continuously in selective medium. Cells were grown to confluence in 25-cc2 culture flasks and incubated with TNF for 4 h. Cells were then washed twice and harvested from each flask with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, plus 1 mM EDTA. After a brief centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.1 mM EDTA, and sonicated for 15 s. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant collected; this centrifugation was repeated twice. The protein concentration of the final supernatant was determined using the BCA protein reagent (Pierce). SOD activity was assayed according to the method of Beauchamp and Fridovich (29Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9906) Google Scholar). Lysate supernatants were analyzed by electrophoresis in a discontinuous polyacrylamide gel, consisting of a 5% stacking gel (pH 6.8) and a 10% running gel. To visualize SOD activity, the gels were incubated for 15 min in the dark with 2.5 mM nitro blue tetrazolium, 30 mM TEMED, 0.028 mM riboflavine, 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, washed twice in deionized water, and then exposed to fluorescent light until clear zones of SOD activity were distinctly evident. Total superoxide dismutase activity was assayed by the method of McCord and Fridovich (30McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using xanthine/xanthine oxidase as the source for superoxide radicals. One enzyme unit of superoxide dismutase is defined as the amount that inhibits cytochrome c reduction by 50%, at room temperature at pH 7.8. CuZn-SOD activity was measured as the cyanide inhibitable fraction of total SOD activity. Cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated for 30 s, and centrifuged twice for 15 min at 10,000 × g. the supernatant was assayed for IL-1α with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits purchased from R & D Systems. The sensitivity of this assay is 0.3 pg for IL-1α. 20 µg of cell lysate proteins were separated in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with Blotto containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min and incubated with a 1:1500 dilution of an anti-human kidney Mn-SOD polyclonal antibody (gift of Dr. Larry W. Oberley, University of Iowa) at 4°C overnight. Membranes were washed three times in Blotto for 15 min and incubated for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phospatase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham). Membranes were washed thre times with Blotto and developed with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated substrate kit (Bio-Rad). HT-1080 cells were grown to confluence in 25-cc2 cultured flasks and treatments were performed as described in the figure legends. RNA was extracted with the RNAzol kit (Biotecx Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following isolation, the RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, pellets washed in 70% ethanol, and air-dried. The dried pellets were resuspended in 25 µl of autoclaved water and RNA quantified spectrophotometrically. For reverse transcription, 2.0 µg of RNA in 10 µl was utilized to synthesize cDNA primed with oligo(dT) in the following reaction mixture: 1 µl of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 6 µl of 5 × reverse transcriptase buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 42°C, 50 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 50 mM dithiothreitol), 0.5 µl of RNase inhibitor, 1.5 µl (1.0 mg/ml) of oligo(dT), 6 µl of 2.5 mM dNTPs (from Boehringer Mannheim), and 3.0 µl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). Following a 5-min preincubation of the total RNA at 65°C and chilling on ice, the reaction mix was then added. The reaction was carried out for 1 h at 42°C, then 95°C for 5 min, followed by the addition of 20 µl of H2O and storage at −20°C until use. For PCR amplification, the oligonucleotide primers were designed utilizing the OLIGO primer analysis software (NBI). Primers were as follows: 5′ IL-1α, 5′-AGGAGAGCATGGTGGTAGTAGC-3′; 3′ IL-1α, 5′-GTAATGCAGCAGCCGTGAGGTA-3′; 5′ GAPDH, 5′ CATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTGG-3′; 3′ GAPDH, 5′-TCTCTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTG-3′. All primers were designed to span introns as to detect contaminating DNA if present and employed at 1.0 µM final concentrations. The PCR mixture (50 µl) consisted of 2.5 µl of each PCR primer (20 µM), 4.0 µl of dNTPs (2.5 mM), 5 µl of 10 × PCR buffer (500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin), 30.75 µl of H2O, 5 µl of cDNA, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Amplification was carried out in a programmable thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer, DNA Thermal Cycler 480). The amplification program was three cycles of 94°C for 60 s, 60°C for 2 min, 72°C for 2 min; followed by 27 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 15 s. Following 30 cycles, the temperature was held at 72°C for 3 min. Positive amplification was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. All experiments utilizing the reverse transcription PCR technique to measure relative mRNA abundance were performed independently in triplicate. Nuclei were prepared from 5 × 107 HT-1080 cells. The nascent RNA was labeled as reported previously (31Groudine M. Peretz M. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Denatured Mn-SOD, IL-1α, and GAPDH were slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes; p3′SS (Stratagene) was included as a negative control. The membranes were hybridized with 2 × 106 cpm of nuclear RNA for 36 h and thoroughly washed in 1.5% SDS at 65°C before autoradiography. When cultures reached 60% confluence in 25 cm2 flasks, the medium was changed and 2.5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2.0 µg of pCAT1.8 or pCATBasic, 2.0 µg of pRSVbgal, and 12.5 µl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated with with the DNA/Lipofectamine mixture for 5 h, at which time treatments were begun in serum-containing minimum essential medium. Cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml), PMA (100 ng/ml), or TNF (10 ng/ml) for 12-18 h, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping into 600 µl of cold 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and subjected to the chloramphenicol acyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase assays. For the CAT assay cells were lysed by four freeze/thaw cycles and centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C. A portion of the supernatant was saved for β-galactosidase analysis, while the remainder of the supernatant was heated for 5 min at 65°C. Equivalent amounts of protein sample were subjected to the CAT assay by using [3H]acetyl-CoA (0.5 µCi/reaction) and chloramphenicol (1 mM/reaction) and the release of lipid-soluble [3H]chloramphenicol was monitored for 1-3 h at 37°C by using scintillation spectrophotometry. β-Galactosidase activity was used to normalize transfections, using a chemiluminescent assay. A pRC/Mn-SOD expression vector containing the complete sense coding region of the human Mn-SOD gene, under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, was transfected into HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells. This vector also contained a neomycin resistance gene driven by the SV40 early promoter, which allowed selection for resistance to G418. Mn-SOD activity of stable transfectants was checked utilizing a Mn-SOD PAGE activity assay, Western blot analysis and a spectrophotometric assay (Fig. 1). The level of Mn-SOD in the HT-1080 and control transfectants (CMVA and CMV2) were similar and equally induced in all three cell lines in response to TNF (Fig. 1A, compare − and + TNF treatments). Mn-SOD activity levels were increased in all the Mn-SOD transfectants when compared to the control cell lines. Western blot analysis closely reflected both the spectrophotometric and PAGE activity assay results (Fig. 1B). In all cases, transfection with the vector alone had no effect on the constitutive or TNF-inducible Mn-SOD activity or immunoreactive protein levels. Furthermore, the overexpressed Mn-SOD level was higher than the level of Mn-SOD in the HT-1080 or control transfectants in response to TNF. To establish that the overexpressed Mn-SOD was associated with mitochondria, subcellular fractionation was performed as described by Volkyl and Fahimi (32Volkyl A. Fahimi H.D. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1994: 550Google Scholar). SOD activity gels on cytosolic, nuclear, mitochondrial, and peroxisomal fractions demonstrated that the Mn-SOD activity resided in the mitochondria (data not shown). Utilizing RT-PCR a number of TNF-induced transcripts including the endogenous Mn-SOD, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 were analyzed, of which only IL-1α was modulated in response to Mn-SOD overexpression. The effect of Mn-SOD overexpression on IL-1α protein levels was also determined utilizing a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cell extracts (Fig. 2). In response to TNF, IL-1α protein levels are increased in the HT-1080 and control transfectants. However, all the cell lines with increased Mn-SOD activity have a reduced level of IL-1α protein both constitutively and in response to TNF. In addition, Mn-SOD overexpression does not affect the cytotoxicity of TNF, which implies that the TNF-receptor complex has not been affected. The ability of Mn-SOD overexpression to alter both the constitutive and TNF-induced IL-1α protein levels was also detected at the mRNA level by utilizing RT-PCR for detection of mRNA abundance (Fig. 3). Fig. 3A shows the relative abundance of the IL-1α RT-PCR product of the cell lines characterized in Fig. 1. The RT-PCR results closely mimic the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results (Fig. 2) and demonstrate that Mn-SOD overexpression is involved in preventing the increase in IL-1α mRNA in response to TNF. The mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH were also monitored as an internal control for PCR-amplification. In all cases GAPDH levels were found to be equal except for a slight elevation in TNF-treated HT3.6 (Fig. 3A), which accounts for the apparent increase in IL-1α mRNA level in that cell line. This increase in IL-1α mRNA levels was not observed in two other independent experiments and was not observed at the the protein level (Fig. 2). IL-1α increases in response to TNF have been shown to occur via enhancement of mRNA stability, mediated by protein kinase C (33Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6214-6220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters activate transcription of IL-1α mRNA and enhance IL-1α mRNA stability (33Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6214-6220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lee W.Y. Butler A.P. Locniskar M.F. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17971-17980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present data demonstrate that Mn-SOD overexpression reduces the TNF-mediated induction of IL-1α. Therefore, we tested if Mn-SOD overexpression affects the protein kinase C-mediated increase in IL-1α mRNA levels. IL-1α induction by PMA was not altered by Mn-SOD overexpression in any of our cell lines (Fig. 3B). To address the involvement of oxygen-derived reactive oxygen metabolites in regulating IL-1α levels, we chose to alter the relative levels of oxygen in the cell. Conservative estimates suggest that 1-2% of the oxygen consumed by the cell is converted to O2 during electron transport. Therefore, by reducing the amounts of available oxygen, one would predict a concominant decrease in mitochondrial superoxide production. Cells were incubated in 3% O2, and then the effects of TNF on IL-1α expression were tested. As shown in Fig. 4, there was a decrease in both the basal and TNF-induced levels of the IL-1α protein in cells incubated at 3% as compared to 21% O2. Mn-SOD overexpression also caused a further reduction in IL-1α protein levels alone and in response to TNF. The differences observed between the respective groups (i.e. control + TNF at 3% O2 versus control + TNF at 21% O2) were significant (p > 0.005) using an unpaired Student's t test with unequal variances. Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1α mRNA abundance can be regulated both transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally. The above data suggest that IL-1α levels are dramatically altered by growth in 3% O2 or by overexpression of Mn-SOD. Nuclear run-off experiments were performed to establish whether the reduction of IL-1α mRNA in 3% oxygen was due to a decreased rate of transcription. Both IL-1α and Mn-SOD mRNA were actively transcribed in control cells grown in 21% oxygen, but growth in 3% oxygen did not appear to decrease the rate of transcription of the IL-1α mRNA with only a slight decrease in Mn-SOD mRNA (Fig. 5, lower panel). The nuclear run-off experiments indicate that 3% oxygen does not decrease IL-1α mRNA by decreasing its rate of transcription. To determine whether the increase in Mn-SOD levels negatively regulate IL-1α promoter activity, we transiently transfected the parental, control cells (CMV) or Mn-SOD-overexpressing cell lines with the plasmid pCAT1.8 containing the CAT reporter gene linked to a 1.8-kilobase pair region of the human IL-1α promoter. Mn-SOD overexpression had no effect on the basal IL-1α promoter activity when compared to the control (CMV) cell lines (Fig. 5, upper panel). To assess the activity of the promoter, a number of known inducers of IL-1α were used, of which only LPS was shown to stimulate promoter activity in these cell lines. These results confirm that the plasmid pCAT1.8 is active in response to LPS treatment, but is not effected by overexpression of Mn-SOD. Both the promoter studies and the nuclear run-off analysis suggest that Mn-SOD overexpression or low oxygen do not alter the transcription rate of IL-1α mRNA. Alternatively, Mn-SOD overexpression and low oxygen may alter the stability of IL-1α mRNA. Gorospe et al. (33Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6214-6220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that the increase in IL-1α levels in response to TNF is due to an increase the stability of the IL-1α mRNA. Experiments were designed to test the effect of oxygen and Mn-SOD overexpression on IL-1α mRNA stability. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide is commonly used to detect unstable mRNAs by increasing their half-life. HT-1080 cells were treated with cycloheximide for 4 h in low (3%) or high (21%) oxygen. Following treatment with cycloheximide, the cells were washed and the decrease in mRNA levels was checked utilizing RT-PCR (Fig. 6, inset). Quantitation of RT-PCR band intensity showed that the apparent half-life of IL-1α mRNA was 2-fold greater in high oxygen than in low oxygen. Mn-SOD overexpression was also shown to specifically decrease IL-1α mRNA half-life with no effect on IL-1β, IL-6 or GAPDH mRNA half-lives (data not shown). Therefore, the decrease in IL-1α levels observed in cell lines overexpressing Mn-SOD or in the presence of low oxygen results from an accelerated decay of IL-1α mRNA. Our findings suggest that Mn-SOD plays a role in the TNF signal pathway leading to increased IL-1α expression. Mn-SOD overexpression alters both basal and TNF-induced IL-1α mRNA levels, but has no effect on the PMA-mediated increase in IL-1α gene expression. PKC inhibitors have been shown to block the TNF-mediated increase in IL-1α mRNA levels (33Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6214-6220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Mn-SOD overexpression in contrast to PKC inhibitors does not block but abates the increase in IL-1α and suggests that both PKC activation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species may be required for the maximal increase in IL-1α levels in response to TNF. However, Mn-SOD overexpression has no effect on the induction of IL-1α by the potent protein kinase C activator PMA. PMA stimulates a 30-fold increase in IL-1α levels as compared to the 10-fold increase observed with TNF. PMA is known to activate 9 of the 12 known PKC isoforms, mediate PKC membrane translocation, and enhance PKC catalytic activity. This multiplicity of the PKC family and the potentiation of activity may annul any effects of Mn-SOD overexpression. Alternatively, Mn-SOD overexpression may exert its effect on a PKC-independent signal pathway such as the ceramide-activated protein kinase, which is not affected by PMA treatment and is activated by TNF (35Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Mn-SOD overexpression or 3% O2 alter IL-1α levels by decreasing the stability of the IL-1α mRNA with no effect on either IL-1α promoter activation or synthesis of newly transcribed IL-1α mRNA. Studies have demonstrated that IL-1α expression in response to TNF is regulated post-transcriptionally by an enhancement of mRNA stability and is protein kinase C-dependent (33Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6214-6220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mn-SOD overexpression decreases the stability of the IL-1α mRNA with no effect on the turnover of the IL-1β or IL-6 mRNA (data not shown). In addition, when cells are cultured in low oxygen, there is a 2-fold decrease in the stability of the IL-1α mRNA (Fig. 6). This 2-fold decrease in mRNA stability in low oxygen can almost completely account for the decrease in the basal levels of IL-1α protein levels observed in Fig. 5. Post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine gene expression is dependent on the inclusion of adenosine/uridine-rich motifs in the 3′-untranslated region (36Carter B.Z. Malter J.S. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 610-621PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of multiple reiterations of AUUUA instability determinants in the 3′-untranslated region of the IL-1α mRNA, and the alteration of IL-1α mRNA stability by Mn-SOD overexpression and oxygen, suggest that a putatative redox-modulated factor may play a role in IL-1α mRNA turnover. Sequence analysis of the 1.8-kilobase pair promoter construct reveals none of the known oxygen-responsive elements, including those for erythropoietin, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, lactate dehydrogenase, and glutathione peroxidase. This may explain the inability of the promoter construct to respond to the increase in Mn-SOD levels, which would serve to provide a reducing environment somewhat similar to the hypoxia required for regulation by the above elements. In addition, the above elements were not found in regions of the gene not contained in the IL-1α promoter construct. The finding that the promoter construct does respond to LPS suggests that it is functional but not redox-sensitive. The inability of low oxygen to alter the levels of newly transcribed RNA for IL-1α also substantiates the promoter analyses. Both basal and TNF-induced IL-1α levels are lowered under 3% O2 (Fig. 4), while the levels of either IL-1β or IL-6 are not affected. Mn-SOD overexpression decreases the induction of IL-1α by TNF, while under low O2 this difference is more pronounced. Both Low O2 and Mn-SOD overexpression would serve to directly decrease superoxide levels in the mitochondria. This suggests that the redox signal leading to expression of IL-1α in response to TNF may be of mitochondrial origin. Mitochondrial electron transport chain functions are, of course, quite sensitive to damage and disruption by superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and related oxygen species (37Zhang Y. Marcillat O. Giulivi C. Ernster L. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16330-16336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Schulze-Osthoff et al. have also shown that TNF-mediated activation of NFκB involves a reactive oxygen species of mitochondrial origin (26Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). IL-1α is a primary response cytokine whose levels are modulated under a variety of pathological conditions. Our data suggest that IL-1α expression may be redox-regulated. Mn-SOD may modulate IL-1α expression by altering the levels or activity of a putative redox factor involved in signal transduction. Mn-SOD overexpression also mimics growth in low oxygen in terms of IL-1α expression and indicates that physiological redox events also regulate IL-1α mRNA stability. The primary function of Mn-SOD is to remove toxic superoxide generated as a consequence of normal metabolism. The induction of Mn-SOD by TNF may not only serve to decrease the toxicity of superoxide, it may also regulate the levels of a superoxide-reactive intermediate involved in the regulation of IL-1α. The induction of Mn-SOD following TNF treatment lags behind that of IL-1α. Studies in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma have shown that IL-1α levels reach maximal in 4-8 h after TNF treatment, followed by a decrease to half of maximal after 18 h of TNF treatment (33Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6214-6220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This time frame would fit perfectly with the maximal induction of Mn-SOD, which occurs between 12 and 18 h (38Melendez J.A. Baglioni C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that Mn-SOD may indeed serve to regulate reactive oxygen species involved in the TNF signal pathway leading to IL-1α expression. The finding that Mn-SOD overexpression alters IL-1α mRNA levels suggests that a superoxide-reactive intermediate of mitochondrial origin may be involved in regulating IL-1α mRNA stability both constitutively and in response to TNF.

https://openalex.org/W2087889505,"The B subunits of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (EtxB) and cholera toxin (CtxB) assemble in vivo into exceptionally stable homopentameric complexes, which maintain their quaternary structure in a range of conditions that would normally be expected to cause protein denaturation. Recently, we showed that the simultaneous protonation of two of the COOH-terminal carboxylates in pentameric EtxB was required to cause its disassembly at pH values below 2.0 (Ruddock, L., Ruston, S. P., Kelly, S. M., Price, N. C., Freedman, R. B., and Hirst, T. R.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 29953-29958). Here, we investigate the influence of environmental parameters on the kinetics of reassembly of acid-generated EtxB monomers in vitro. Such monomers were found to undergo a further acid-mediated conformational change, with an activation energy of 76 +/- 2 J.mol-1.K-1, consistent with isomerization of the cis-proline residue at position 93, and which prevented subsequent EtxB reassembly. By using rapid neutralization of acid-generated monomers, a high proportion of the B-subunits adopted an assembly-competent conformation, which resulted in up to 75% of the protein reassembling into a stable pentameric complex, indistinguishable from native EtxB pentamers. The rate-limiting step in reassembly, over a concentration range of 50-200 microg/ml, was shown to be due to an intramolecular event, which exhibited a pH dependence with a pKa of 7.0. Modification of EtxB with amine-specific probes revealed that the protonation state of the NH2-terminal alanine residue was responsible for the pH dependence of reassembly. The implications of these findings for the biogenesis of Escherichia coli enterotoxin and related enterotoxins in vivo, are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2028023116,"Sialidase L is a NeuAcα2→3Gal linkage-specific sialidase that releases 2,7-anhydro-NeuAc instead of NeuAc from sialoglycoconjugates (Chou, M.-Y., Li, S.-C., Kiso, M., Hasegawa, A., and Li, Y.-T. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18821-18826). A 2.5-kilobase cDNA of sialidase L was cloned by a combination of methods based on polymerase chain reactions. The composite cDNA sequence reveals an open reading frame coding for 762 amino acids, including a putative 28-residue signal peptide at the N terminus that is similar to the signal sequence of the Clostridium septicum sialidase. The result suggests that sialidase L is a secretory enzyme. The coding sequence excluding the putative signal peptide of sialidase L was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme was characterized to be as active as the enzyme isolated from the leech. It also possessed the strict NeuAcα2→3Gal linkage specificity and released the unique cleavage product, 2,7-anhydro-NeuAc from sialoglycoconjugates. The deduced amino acid sequence of sialidase L exhibits little similarity with other reported sialidases. However, sialidase L contains a conserved “FRIP region” and four repeating “Asp box” motifs that align well with the corresponding positions of bacterial sialidases. The predicted β-strand structures near the conserved motifs of sialidase L are similar to those of Salmonella typhimurium sialidase. Several conserved single amino acid residues of bacterial sialidases, including those known to be involved in the active site of Salmonella enzyme, are conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of sialidase L. This observation suggests that part of the catalytic mechanism of sialidase L may be similar to the ordinary sialidase. Sialidase L is a NeuAcα2→3Gal linkage-specific sialidase that releases 2,7-anhydro-NeuAc instead of NeuAc from sialoglycoconjugates (Chou, M.-Y., Li, S.-C., Kiso, M., Hasegawa, A., and Li, Y.-T.

The purified recombinant enzyme was characterized to be as active as the enzyme isolated from the leech. It also possessed the strict NeuAcα2→3Gal linkage specificity and released the unique cleavage product, 2,7-anhydro-NeuAc from sialoglycoconjugates. The deduced amino acid sequence of sialidase L exhibits little similarity with other reported sialidases. However, sialidase L contains a conserved “FRIP region” and four repeating “Asp box” motifs that align well with the corresponding positions of bacterial sialidases. The predicted β-strand structures near the conserved motifs of sialidase L are similar to those of Salmonella typhimurium sialidase. Several conserved single amino acid residues of bacterial sialidases, including those known to be involved in the active site of Salmonella enzyme, are conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of sialidase L. This observation suggests that part of the catalytic mechanism of sialidase L may be similar to the ordinary sialidase. INTRODUCTIONSialidases (EC) hydrolyze α-ketosidically linked sialic acids from sialo-glycoconjugates. They are widely distributed in nature and have been isolated from microorganisms (i.e. bacteria, viruses, and protozoa) as well as mammalian tissues (1Schauer R. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schauer R. Sialic Acids: Chemistry, Metabolism and Functions. Springer-Verlag, Vienna1982: 1Google Scholar). Bacterial sialidases have been suggested to initiate microbial infections of animals (2Saito M. Yu R.K. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids: Biochemistry and Function of Sialidases. Plenum Press, New York1995: 261Google Scholar, 3Schauer R. Popper H. Reutter W. Gudat F. Kottgen E. Structural Carbohydrates of the Liver: Glycosidases with Special Reference to the Pathophysiological Role of Sialidases. University Park Press, Baltimore1983: 83-97Google Scholar), while mammalian sialidases have been shown to be involved in the catabolism of sialoglycoconjugates (1Schauer R. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schauer R. Sialic Acids: Chemistry, Metabolism and Functions. Springer-Verlag, Vienna1982: 1Google Scholar).We have reported that the North American leech, Macrobdella decora, contains two sialidases: an ordinary sialidase and an unusual sialidase, sialidase L, which produces 2,7-anhydro-NeuAc instead of NeuAc from various sialoglycoconjugates (4Li Y.-T. Nakagawa H. Ross S.A. Hansson G.C. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21629-21633Google Scholar). In addition, this unusual sialidase was found to exhibit a strict linkage specificity toward the hydrolysis of only the NeuAcα2→3Gal linkage (5Chou M.-Y. Li S.-C. Kiso Hasegawa A. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18821-18826Google Scholar). This enzyme has been shown to hydrolyze only the NeuAcα2→3Gal linkage in a mixture of sialoglycoconjugates without destroying other sialosyl linkages, such as NeuAcα2→6Gal, NeuAcα2→6GalNAc, NeuAcα2→6GlcNAc, NeuAcα2→8NeuAc and NeuAcα2→9NeuAc linkages. Due to its strict linkage specificity, sialidase L is very useful for studying the biological significance of the NeuAcα2→3Gal linkage and the structural determination of sialoglycoconjugates.We have purified sialidase L to homogeneity from the Macrobdella leeches and determined the amino acid sequences of nine peptides released by CNBr cleavage and tryptic digestion (5Chou M.-Y. Li S.-C. Kiso Hasegawa A. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18821-18826Google Scholar). Two of the tryptic peptides were found to contain the sequence, Ser-X-Asp-X-Gly-X-Thr-Trp, “Asp box,” which is conserved and repeated four to five times in many bacterial sialidases (6Roggentin P.

The yield of the pure sialidase L from the original source was only 130 µg/20 kg of leeches (5Chou M.-Y. Li S.-C. Kiso Hasegawa A. Li Y.-T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2002161747,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) of Escherichia coli is regulated by a bifunctional protein, IDH kinase/phosphatase. In addition to the kinase and phosphatase activities, this protein catalyzes an intrinsic ATPase reaction. The initial velocity kinetics of these activities exhibited extensive similarities. IDH kinase and phosphatase both yielded intersecting double-reciprocal plots. In addition, we observed similar values for the kinetic constants describing interactions of the kinase and phosphatase with their protein substrates and the interactions of all three activities with ATP. In contrast, while the maximum velocities of IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase were nearly equal, they were 10-fold less than the maximum velocity of the ATPase. Although the IDH phosphatase reaction required either ATP or ADP, it was not supported by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate.The kinetic properties of wild-type IDH kinase/phosphatase were compared with those of two mutant derivatives of this protein. The mutations in these proteins selectively inhibit IDH phosphatase activity. Inhibition of IDH phosphatase resulted from three factors: decreases in the maximum velocities, reduced affinities for phospho-IDH, and a loss of coupling between ATP and phospho-IDH. These mutations also affected the properties of IDH kinase, increasing the maximum velocities and decreasing the affinities for ATP and phospho-IDH. The intrinsic ATPase activities also exhibited reduced affinity for ATP. These results are discussed in the context of a model which proposes that all three activities occur at the same active site.

The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of IDH are catalyzed by a bifunctional protein, IDH kinase/phosphatase. IDH kinase/phosphatase is expressed from a single gene, aceK, and both activities reside on the same polypeptide (3LaPorte D.C. Chung T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15291-15297Google Scholar, 4LaPorte D.C. Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10563-10568Google Scholar, 5LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity of this protein has an absolute requirement for ATP or ADP (5LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Google Scholar). IDH kinase/phosphatase also catalyzes an ATPase reaction. This ATPase activity occurs in the absence of the protein substrates and is only partially inhibited when these substrates are present (6Stueland C.S. Eck K.R. Stieglbauer K.T. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol.

One approach that we have taken to examine IDH kinase/phosphatase has been the random mutagenesis of aceK. We previously described the isolation of a class of mutant alleles whose products retain IDH kinase activity but have dramatically reduced IDH phosphatase activity. The products of these alleles have suffered single amino acid substitutions that fall within a 113-amino acid region of this 578-residue protein (7Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1801-1806Google Scholar, 8Ikeda T.P. Houtz E.K. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1414-1416Google Scholar). The regulation of IDH kinase/phosphatase has been under study for nearly 15 years (reviewed in Ref. 9LaPorte D.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 14-18Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively little attention has been given to the enzymology of this unusual protein. This paper presents the results of an initial characterization of the kinetic properties of IDH kinase/phosphatase and of the products of two of the mutant derivatives: AceK3 (Gln373→ Arg) and AceK4 (Tyr414→ Cys) (7Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1801-1806Google Scholar, 8Ikeda T.P. Houtz E.K. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1414-1416Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from DuPont NEN and further purified by the method of Axelson et al. (10Axelson J.T. Bodley J.W. Walseth T.F. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 357-360Google Scholar). Adenylyl imidodiphosphate was purchased from Sigma and purified by the method of Olson et al. 2L. K. Olson, W. A. Schroeder, S. P. Miller, and T. F. Walseth, manuscript in preparation. All reagents were of the purest grades available. Plasmids pDL9, pDL25, and pDL30 express the aceK+, aceK3, and aceK4 genes, respectively, from the tac promoter (7Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1801-1806Google Scholar). To maintain plasmid selection during high-density fermentation, derivatives of these plasmids were constructed which contain the tetr gene for selection. Briefly, the 1.6-kilobase SspI-AvaI fragment of plasmid pBR322 containing the tetr gene was isolated, filled in with Klenow, and BglII linkers were attached. The resulting fragment was digested with BglII and then ligated into the BamHl site of pDL9, pDL25, and pDL30 generating the plasmids pEKL1, pEKL5, and pEKL3, respectively. IDH was overexpressed in E. coli strain Y1090 harboring the multicopy plasmid pTK509 which carries the gene encoding IDH (4LaPorte D.C. Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10563-10568Google Scholar). IDH was purified by a modification of the method of Garnak and Reeves (11Garnak M. Reeves H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7915-7920Google Scholar). Phospho-IDH was prepared in vitro using purified IDH and wild-type IDH kinase/phosphatase. Phospho-IDH was then separated from IDH kinase/phosphatase by chromatography on an Affi-Gel blue column (12LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Google Scholar). Wild-type IDH kinase/phosphatase was purified from E. coli strain ST2010R harboring the plasmid pEKL1. The mutant AceK3 and AceK4 proteins were purified from the E. coli strain SL1R (ΔaceK::Kanr) (13Stueland C.S. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13775-13779Google Scholar) harboring either plasmid pEKL5 or pEKL3, respectively. All strains were grown at 37°C in L broth (1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, 0.5% yeast extract) with 40 µg/ml tetracycline in a 3.5-liter high-density fermentor. Expression of the aceK genes was induced with 3 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside during the mid-log phase of growth and then the strains were grown for an additional 3-4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80°C. The purification of IDH kinase/phosphatase has been described previously (5LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The activity of IDH phosphatase was measured by following the release of [32P]phosphate from [32P]phospho-IDH as described previously (12LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Google Scholar). The standard reaction (50 µl) contained 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and variable concentrations of [32P]phospho-IDH (~1 × 105 cpm/assay) and Mg·ATP. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5.4 ng of wild-type, 420 ng of AceK3, or 920 ng of AceK4 IDH kinase/phosphatase and then incubated for 20 min at 37°C. The amount of [32P]phosphate released was measured in the supernatant following acid precipitation of the protein. The activity of IDH kinase was determined by monitoring the transfer of [32P]phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP to IDH as described previously (12LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (50 µl) contained 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and variable concentrations of Mg·[γ-32P]ATP (~3 × 106 cpm/assay) and IDH. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5.4 ng of wild-type, 1.0 ng of AceK3, or 1.8 ng of AceK4 IDH kinase/phosphatase and then incubated for 20 min at 37°C. The production of [32P]phospho-IDH was monitored by precipitating the protein onto filter paper and measuring the amount of radioactivity. The bifunctional nature of IDH kinase/phosphatase can interfere with these assays. For example, [32P]phospho-IDH produced by IDH kinase could be lost due to dephosphorylation by IDH phosphatase. Control experiments established that product loss in the kinase assay was not significant under the conditions that we employed. In addition, phosphorylation of dephospho-IDH produced in the IDH phosphatase assay could dilute the specific activity of the [32P]phospho-IDH used as the substrate. However, this did not interfere with our results, because substrate conversion was always less than 20%. ATPase activity was measured using the method of Bais (15Bais R. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 271-273Google Scholar). The reactions (50 µl) contained 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and variable concentrations of Mg·[γ-32P]ATP (~5 × 105 cpm/assay). The reactions were initiated by the addition of 140 ng of wild-type, 260 ng of AceK3, or 920 ng of AceK4 IDH kinase/phosphatase and then incubated at 37°C. The amount of [32P]phosphate released was determined following absorption of the unreacted ATP with activated charcoal. Measurements of the initial velocity of wild-type IDH phosphatase produced intersecting patterns on double-reciprocal plots (Fig. 1A). Such plots are typical of a sequential mechanism (i.e. ordered or random). Sequential mechanisms can be described by Equation 1, v=VmaxAB/(KaKmb+KmaB+KmbA+AB)(Eq. 1) where A and B are the substrate concentrations, v is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum velocity, Ka is the apparent dissociation constant for A, and Kma and Kmb are the Michaelis constants for A and B, respectively (16Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1970: 1Google Scholar). Estimates of the kinetic parameters were determined from Eq. 1 using the computer program SEQUENL developed by Cleland (17Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Google Scholar). The results are summarized in Table I. The apparent dissociation constant of wild-type IDH phosphatase for ATP (KATP = 98 µM) was much greater than the corresponding Michaelis constant (6 µM). A similar relationship was observed for the kinetic constants for phospho-IDH (6 and 0.4 µM, respectively). The ratio of these constants, α = K/Km, provides a measure of the apparent substrate interaction, where α = 1 indicates independent binding. The α-value of ~17 for wild-type IDH phosphatase suggests that substrate binding is coupled (i.e. the binding of one substrate enhances the binding of the other substrate).Table I.Kinetic constants for wild-type and mutant IDH kinase/phosphatase activitiesActivityProteinVmaxaThe values are given in terms of nmol/mg/min.Km,ATPbKm = Michaelis constant.

Open table in a new tab Like wild-type IDH phosphatase, the residual IDH phosphatase of the AceK3 protein produced intersecting double-reciprocal plots (Fig. 1B). Similar patterns were observed with the AceK4 IDH phosphatase (data not shown). However, the single amino acid substitutions in the mutant proteins have produced striking changes in the kinetic properties of the residual IDH phosphatase activities. The maximal velocities of both mutant IDH phosphatases were decreased relative to the wild-type enzyme. The Vmax of the AceK3 phosphatase was decreased by a factor of 2.5, while the AceK4 phosphatase had suffered a 5-fold reduction in Vmax (Table I). The aceK3 and aceK4 mutations have also produced dramatic changes in the kinetic behavior of IDH phosphatase with respect to ATP (Table I). The Km,ATP of AceK3 IDH phosphatase increased 9-fold, while the value of KATP decreased by a factor of 2 when compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. The AceK4 product exhibited increases in the Km,ATP and KATP values of 20- and 3-fold, respectively. The mutant IDH phosphatases also exhibited dramatic changes in the kinetic parameters for phospho-IDH (Table I). The Km,IDH-P and KIDH-P values of AceK3 IDH phosphatase were increased 52- and 3-fold, respectively, relative to those of the wild-type protein, while the AceK4 protein showed a 48-fold increase in Km,IDH-P and 7-fold increase in KIDH-P. The coupling between ATP and phospho-IDH that we observed for wild-type IDH phosphatase has also been effected by these mutations. The AceK4 protein exhibited a small residual coupling, while the AceK3 protein exhibited no coupling at all. Like IDH phosphatase, wild-type IDH kinase exhibited intersecting patterns in double-reciprocal plots (Fig. 2A). We observed strong coupling between ATP and dephospho-IDH, which is also similar to the behavior of wild-type IDH phosphatase (Table I). The initial velocity patterns of the AceK3 (Fig. 2B) and AceK4 (data not shown) IDH kinases resembled those of the wild-type kinase. The mutant kinases retained affinity for dephospho-IDH and coupling between this substrate and ATP (Table I). However, the maximum velocities were increased by 5-fold for both proteins. In addition, the affinities of these kinases for ATP were decreased by factors of 3 and 30 for AceK3 and AceK4, respectively. The mutations in aceK3 and aceK4 have had strikingly different effects on the kinetic characteristics of IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase. The maximum velocities of the kinases have increased, while those of the phosphatase have decreased. The kinase activities retained their affinity for the protein substrate (dephospho-IDH), while the residual phosphatase activities exhibited reduced affinity for its protein substrate (phospho-IDH). Finally, the AceK3 and AceK4 IDH kinases retained positive coupling between ATP and the protein substrate while their phosphatase activities did not. Since the aceK3 and aceK4 mutations alter the affinity of IDH phosphatase for phospho-IDH, we also examined the effect of these mutations on the affinity of IDH kinase for phospho-IDH. The affinities for phospho-IDH were estimated from product inhibition studies. The bifunctional nature of wild-type IDH kinase/phosphatase posed inherent complications for analysis of the inhibition of IDH kinase by phospho-IDH. For example, the sequential dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation of the added phospho-IDH could have resulted in the incorporation of 32P into the phospho-IDH pool. To evaluate this source of interference, we performed IDH kinase assays in the absence of dephospho-IDH (Fig. 3A, solid circles). We observed a low level of 32P incorporation into protein, and this effect was saturated at the lowest concentration of phospho-IDH, which we employed. The precise mechanism responsible for 32P incorporation into IDH under these conditions is uncertain, but this effect must be considered when evaluating the ability of phospho-IDH to act as an inhibitor of IDH kinase. Wild-type IDH kinase was inhibited by phospho-IDH (Fig. 3A, open circles). The precise value of the inhibition constant cannot be determined since 32P incorporation into the phospho-IDH pool contributed to the observed IDH kinase activity (see above). However, we were able to calculate a range for this constant by subtracting or ignoring the incorporation observed in the absence of dephospho-IDH (Fig. 3B and Table I). The range of this constant, 8-15 µM, is negligible compared with the effects that the aceK3 and aceK4 mutations had on the affinities of the mutant IDH kinases for phospho-IDH (see below). We have also examined inhibition of the mutant IDH kinases by phospho-IDH. In contrast with wild-type IDH kinase/phosphatase, label was not incorporated into IDH in the absence of dephospho-IDH. (This was the expected result since the AceK3 and AceK4 proteins retain very little IDH phosphatase activity.) To aid the comparison of wild-type and mutant IDH kinases, we employed concentrations of ATP and dephospho-IDH, which were in the psuedo-first order range for all three enzymes. The mutant activities exhibited dramatic increases in the apparent Ki values for phospho-IDH relative to the wild-type protein (Table I). These values were at least 20-fold higher for the AceK3 and AceK4 kinases. The effective Km,IDH-P of the IDH phosphatases were increased to similar extents at this concentration of ATP: 30-fold for AceK3 and 47-fold for AceK4. In addition to the IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase reactions, IDH kinase/phosphatase exhibits an intrinsic ATPase activity (6Stueland C.S. Eck K.R. Stieglbauer K.T. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16095-16099Google Scholar). The kinetic constants of the wild-type and mutant ATPase activities were estimated from double reciprocal plots (Table I). The maximum velocities of all three proteins greatly exceeded the corresponding values for the kinase and phosphatase activities. Although the Vmax values of the mutant and wild-type proteins were similar, the Km,ATP of the AceK3 and AceK4 ATPase activities are increased 3- and 12-fold, respectively. IDH phosphatase exhibits an absolute requirement for either ATP or ADP (5LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Google Scholar). Our working model proposes that the actual substrate for IDH phosphatase is ADP but that ATP can be converted to ADP by the ATPase activity (see “Discussion”). To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, 5′ adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMPP(NH)P), to support the wild-type IDH phosphatase reaction. This nucleotide clearly binds to IDH phosphatase, since it inhibited this reaction in the presence of ATP (Table II). However, in the absence of ATP, AMPP(NH)P did not support IDH phosphatase activity. This observation is consistent with the proposal that ATP must be converted to ADP before it can participate in the IDH phosphatase reaction.Table IIThe effect of AMPP(NH)P on wild-type IDH phosphatase activity[ATP][AMPP(NH)P]IDH phosphataseµMmMfmol/min20026.7 ± 0.820418.2 ± 0.3000.0 ± 0.1040.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab IDH kinase/phosphatase possesses three activities: IDH kinase, IDH phosphatase, and an ATPase. The initial velocity behaviors of these activities were similar for the wild-type protein. For example, the apparent dissociation constants for the protein substrates for IDH kinase (KIDH) and IDH phosphatase (KIDH-P) were 2.4 and 6 µM. The apparent dissociation constant for ATP of the kinase and phosphatase and the Km of the ATPase activity were also similar. The kinase and phosphatase exhibited strong coupling (α) between ATP and the protein substrates. In contrast, although the maximum velocities of IDH kinase and phosphatase were nearly identical, the Vmax of the ATPase was about an order of magnitude greater. The significance of this difference is discussed below. We previously reported the isolation of mutant derivatives of IDH kinase/phosphatase (7Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1801-1806Google Scholar, 8Ikeda T.P. Houtz E.K. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1414-1416Google Scholar). These proteins retained IDH kinase activity but had suffered striking reductions in IDH phosphatase activity. Our kinetic analyses provide insights into the mechanism responsible for this selective loss of IDH phosphatase activity of two of these proteins: AceK3 (Gln373→ Arg) and AceK4 (Tyr414→ Cys). Three factors have contributed to this loss: decreases in the maximum velocities, reduced affinities for the protein substrate (phospho-IDH), and a loss of coupling between ATP and phospho-IDH. These proteins retained IDH kinase activity, because binding of dephospho-IDH and coupling between ATP and dephospho-IDH were unaffected. In addition, the decrease in the affinity of these kinase activities for ATP was offset by an increase in the maximum velocities. We have developed a working model that describes IDH kinase/phosphatase. This model proposes that the kinase, phosphatase, and ATPase reactions occur in the same active site. This active site can exist in two conformations, one favoring IDH kinase and the other favoring IDH phosphatase. The phosphatase reaction results from the kinase back reaction tightly coupled to the ATPase reaction (Fig. 4). Although this model is speculative, it is supported by a variety of observations. The model explains the unusual nucleotide requirement of IDH phosphatase: this activity has an absolute dependence on either ATP or ADP. In contrast, this activity is not supported by a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP. Our model proposes that ADP acts as a transient phosphate acceptor. A similar role is played by the active site serine of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (18Coleman J.E. Gettins P. Adv. Enzymol. 1983; 55: 381-452Google Scholar). This model also explains the unusual ATPase activity of IDH kinase/phosphatase. Weak ATPase activities are often associated with kinases in the absence of the normal phosphate acceptor. In contrast, the Vmax of the ATPase activity of IDH kinase/phosphatase is almost an order of magnitude greater than that of either the kinase or phosphatase (Table I). Furthermore, while the ATPase activities of other kinases are completely inhibited by the normal phosphate acceptor, the ATPase of IDH kinase/phosphatase is only partially inhibited by either dephospho- or phospho-IDH (6Stueland C.S. Eck K.R. Stieglbauer K.T. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16095-16099Google Scholar). A number of observations support the existence of a single ATP binding site for IDH kinase/phosphatase. The sequence of IDH kinase/phosphatase includes a single region that matches the consensus for ATP binding sites (19Klumpp D.J. Plank D.W. Bowdin L.J. Stueland C.S. Chung T. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2763-2769Google Scholar). Mutation of the “invariant” lysine of this motif eliminated both IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase without destabilizing the protein (13Stueland C.S. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13775-13779Google Scholar). The results of affinity labeling experiments are also consistent with a single ATP binding site: azido-ATP produced parallel inhibition of IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase yet labeled a single peptide (20Varela I. Nimmo H.G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 361-365Google Scholar). Our working model provides a framework for interpretation of the kinetic characteristics of the mutant proteins. We suspect that the mutations in these proteins have shifted the conformational equilibrium toward the kinase conformation at the expense of IDH phosphatase. However, it should be noted that this is not the only model that could explain the results presented in this paper. The IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase activities of the mutant protein exhibited reciprocal changes in their maximum velocities: the Vmax of the kinase was increased while that of the phosphatase was decreased. This might have resulted from a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward the kinase form. The IDH kinase and phosphatase activities exhibited a parallel loss of affinity for phospho-IDH. This observation tends to favor a single binding site for phospho-IDH, a feature of our model. Effects of these mutations on the KATP values for IDH kinase and IDH phosphatase and on the Km,ATP value for the ATPase are more ambiguous. In the simplest case, these values should be roughly equal if all three activities occur at the same active site. These values were similar for the wild-type protein, consistent with the evidence that favors a single ATP binding site (see above). However, while the values for the kinase and ATPase agreed for the mutant proteins, the value of KATP for the IDH phosphatase activities did not. If our model is correct, this discrepancy might reflect differences in the properties of the kinase and phosphatase conformations of the mutant proteins. However, this issue remains to be resolved. Why would IDH kinase/phosphatase catalyze the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of IDH at the same active site? Such an arrangement would allow these reactions to employ some of the same catalytic groups. According to our model, IDH kinase/phosphatase employs the kinase back reaction as part of the IDH phosphatase reaction. In addition, the protein substrates of IDH kinase and phosphatase are nearly identical, differing only in the phosphorylation of Ser113. Catalysis of both reactions at the same site would allow many of the same amino acids to be used for substrate recognition. The ultimate resolution of these issues will require the crystal structure of IDH kinase/phosphatase complexed with its substrates. We thank W. W.

The availability of cDNA clones from various sources provides a powerful tool for examining folate transport processes. However, at present very little is known about the molecular details of folate transport. We have previously described the isolation of both a hamster genomic DNA cosmid clone (29Underhill T.M. Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 337-349Google Scholar) and a cDNA clone (pMtxT9) (28Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Google Scholar) that can, upon transfection, complement mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that are unable to take up folates. Mutant cells transfected with the cDNA are able to bind and take up Mtx and thus become sensitive to the cytotoxic action of the drug. In our continuing studies to understand the molecular nature of the reduced folate carrier gene we have localized the gene for hamster rfc to chromosomes 1 and Z1 at position q2-q3 in CHO cells (30Chan F.P.H. Williams F.M.R. Rogers K.A. Flintoff W.F. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 71: 148-150Google Scholar). The present study describes the organization of the hamster rfc gene, the identification of two alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms, and the mapping of the transcriptional start site. The wild-type, Mtx-sensitive (Pro−3) and Mtx-resistant (Pro−3 MtxRII 5-3) cell lines and their maintenance have been previously described (31Flintoff W.F. Davidson S.V. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1976; 2: 245-261Google Scholar, 32Flintoff W.F. Spindler S.M. Siminovitch L. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 749-757Google Scholar). The cosmid clone, 100-2, containing CHO DNA sequences that complement a mutant cell line defective in Mtx transport has been previously described (29Underhill T.M. Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 337-349Google Scholar). The isolation of the cDNA clone, pMtxT9, and its properties have been described (28Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Google Scholar). High molecular weight DNA was isolated from exponentially growing CHO cells by the procedure of Gross-Bellard et al. (33Gross-Bellard M. Oudet P. Chambon P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 36: 32-38Google Scholar). Cosmid and plasmid clones were propagated in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin or ampicillin plus tetracycline. DNA was isolated from overnight cultures using the Qiagen plasmid kit as described by the manufacturer. High molecular weight DNA or cosmid DNA was digested with either BamHI or HindIII (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the conditions of the supplier. The digested DNA was separated on a 0.8% agarose gels and transferred onto Biotrans nylon paper (ICN Biomedicals) by the method of Southern (34Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Google Scholar). Blots were prehybridized for 24 h at 65°C in 5 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 200 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS. Labeled DNA from the plasmid pMtxT9 was added to the hybridization mixture to a final concentration of 2-4 ng/ml. After 48 h at 65°C the blots were washed two times for 15 min with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and three times for 15 min with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C. Blots were exposed to x-ray film at −70°C with intensifying screens. The CHO rfc cDNA fragment from the plasmid pMtxT9 was used as probe and labeled with α-[32P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals; 3000 Ci/mmol) by the random priming method described by Feinberg and Vogelstein (35Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar). Labeled DNA was routinely obtained at a specific activity of 5-10 × 108 cpm/µg. Oligodeoxynucleotides used as probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia) and γ-[32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals; 7000 Ci/mmol) to a specific activity of approximately 1 × 108 cpm/µg. The initial restriction endonuclease map of cosmid 100-2 was derived from partial endonuclease digestion and hybridization with either T3 or T7 end-labeled sequencing primers as described previously (29Underhill T.M. Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 337-349Google Scholar). Fine mapping of restriction endonuclease sites was done by hybridizing Southern blots with end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide primers that span the cDNA sequence in pMtxT9. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using the T7 sequencing kit supplied by Pharmacia. Sequences were obtained using either T7 or Sp6 sequencing primers or synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primers spanning the cDNA sequence in pMtxT9. Cosmid clone fragments chosen for sequence analysis were isolated and subcloned into the vectors pGEM3 or pGEM4 and propagated in Escherichia coli strains SURE®, XL1-Blue, or JM109. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from ~2 × 108 exponentially growing Pro−3 cells using the Fast Track mRNA isolation system (Invitrogen). Approximately 30 µg of poly(A+) RNA was obtained from this number of cells. Five µg of poly(A+) RNA from Pro−3 cells were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) as described previously (28Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to Biotrans nylon paper (ICN Biomedicals) as described previously (28Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Google Scholar). Hybridization, washing, and autoradiography were performed as described previously for Southern blotting (29Underhill T.M. Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 337-349Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of poly(A+) RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the conditions recommended by the supplier. Sequences corresponding to pMtxT9 were amplified from the first-strand cDNA using a 20-mer forward primer (P1: 5′-GTGTTGTAGTGCGCGTGGTG-3′) that was designed at base pair −221 of the rfc mRNA1 sequence and a 20-mer reverse primer designed at either base pair 208 (P2: 5′-GCACCGGAATGATCTCATTG-3′) or base pair 2067 (P3: 5′-TGTGCCTTGGCTGGTGTCTG-3′) for 30 cycles of amplification using standard PCR conditions. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels or 5% acrylamide gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products were subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and were sequenced as described above. The mRNA isoforms were amplified by RT-PCR from Pro−3 cells using the 20-mer forward primer P1 and a 20-mer reverse primer designed at base pair 1733 (P4: 5′-GGAGAGGTTGCTTAAGTCAG-3′). The resulting PCR product spans full-length coding sequences. The Expand polymerase mixture (Boehringer-Mannheim) was used to minimize polymerase errors. The PCR products were directionally cloned into the pCR3 vector using the unidirectional TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The PCR product clones were screened by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing to identify clones of the larger DNA isoform. Transfection of the PCR product clones was carried out by the polybrene procedure as described previously (36Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1754-1758Google Scholar). Ten µg of DNA per 1-2 × 105 cells were transfected into the mutant Pro−3 MtxRII 5-3 cells. After transfection, cells were selected by growth in low levels of folinic acid (2 nM) (37Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 49-59Google Scholar). Cells able to grow in the selective medium were isolated and tested for sensitivity to Mtx as described previously (31Flintoff W.F. Davidson S.V. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1976; 2: 245-261Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 Pro−3 cells using a guanidinium-isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (38Leibbrandt M.E.I. Khokha R. Koropatnick J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 17-25Google Scholar). 5′-RACE was performed using the 5′-RACE System according to the conditions of the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription was primed with a 20-mer reverse primer designed at base pair 500 (P5: 5′-ACAGAGCTGGTGAAGACTCC-3′) relative to the pMtxT9 sequence. Tailed products were amplified by PCR using the 5′ anchor primer and a nested reverse primer (P2). These products were diluted 20- or 50-fold and reamplified using the nested universal amplification primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a specific reverse primer designed at base pair 149 (P6: 5′-GGTGTGATGAAGCTCTCC-3′). The RACE products were cloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced as described above. Antisense probes were prepared from a 400-bp subclone of the cosmid 100-2 in the vector pGEM4, which contained sequences extending 109 bp upstream of the first nucleotide of pMtxT9. Probes were synthesized using T3 polymerase (Pharmacia) incorporating α-[32P]CTP (DuPont NEN; 800 Ci/mmol). The probe was purified on a 5% denaturing acrylamide gel. Approximately 5 × 105 cpm were combined with 2.5 µg of poly(A+) mRNA or 3 µg of yeast RNA and hybridized for 18 h at 45°C. Ribonuclease digestion was performed using the RPA II kit according to the supplier's recommendations (Ambion Inc.). Protected fragments were separated on a 20% denaturing acrylamide gel. Sizes were approximated using 32P end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides. Previously we have isolated a genomic clone and the corresponding cDNA that are able to complement the phenotype of a mutant hamster cell line that is defective in Mtx uptake. The availability of both genomic and cDNA clones for this function allowed the determination of its genomic organization. To determine the intron/exon organization of the gene, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides derived from regions spanning the cDNA were hybridized to DNA from the cosmid to identify complementary sequences. DNA sequencing was performed either directly on the cosmid DNA or on subcloned fragments to determine the intron/exon boundaries. These analyses revealed 7 exons and 6 introns that span approximately 15.3 kb (Fig. 1A). The donor and acceptor sequences (Table I) conform to consensus GT/AG splice site sequences with the exception of the donor splice site of intron 3. This site has a C replacing the consensus T at the +2 position of the intron. Although it is rare, this substitution has been observed in other donor splice sites (39Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Google Scholar).Table IIntron-exon boundary sequences of the hamster reduced folate carrierExonSizePosition in cDNADonorIntronSizeAcceptorExonExonIntronIntronExonbpkb153−221 to −169GCTGAACCAGgtacaggcct10.47atccctctagAACCGAGTTC22121−168 to −48TCCACGCCTGgtacgtggca24.5taccttccagGTGGAGTGTC33230−47 to 183AATCGAGCAGgcatgttgtt31.75catcccacagGTGACCAATG44757184 to 940ACACTGCTGAgtatgcactg40.5ctacctccagGCGCCATCAC55211941 to 1151CCATTGCCACgtgagtagga51.7acctccccagTTTTCAGATT661421152 to 1293TGAAAAACAGgtaagctcca63.6tctctttcagTTTTGCATCT771,2331294 to 2526AGACTCTGTT Open table in a new tab The exon sequences were in agreement with the previously reported cDNA sequence (28Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Google Scholar) with one exception. The original cDNA was isolated from a CHO-K1 cDNA expression library. The cDNA contains the sequence AGA beginning at base pair 1459, which codes for arginine in the predicted amino acid sequence. The cosmid 100-2, which contains genomic DNA sequences from the Pro−3 cell line, has the sequence GGA at this position, which codes for a glycine residue. This difference appears to be a polymorphism, because other cDNA clones from the CHO-K1 library contain the AGA sequence at this position, while cDNA clones and RT-PCR sequence data from the Pro−3 cell line all contain the GGA sequence. 2R. C. Murray, F. M. R. Williams, and W. F. Flintoff, unpublished data. Although the significance of this change is not clear, both cosmid DNA from Pro−3 and cDNA from CHO-K1 or Pro−3 (see below) are able to complement the Mtx transport defect in the mutant cells, which indicates that this change may not be functionally important. The cosmid 100-2 was isolated from a Pro−3 genomic cosmid library by two rounds of genomic cloning (29Underhill T.M. Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 337-349Google Scholar). In order to ensure that the genomic organization of 100-2 reported above had not been altered during the selection and cloning process, these sequences were compared to genomic DNA isolated from the Pro−3 cell line by Southern hybridization using the cDNA sequence as a probe (Fig. 2). The restriction endonuclease pattern of Pro−3 genomic DNA as compared to cosmid 100-2 indicated a similar structure, with some exceptions. The largest fragments in both the BamHI and HindIII digests of cosmid 100-2 DNA are smaller than their counterparts in genomic DNA. This difference is due to truncation of the ends of the DNA in the cosmid 100-2 as a result of the cloning process (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1A also illustrates the change in the order of the restriction enzyme sites at the 3′ end of the cosmid 100-2. This difference may also be due to the truncation of this end during the cloning process, which involved two rounds of genomic cloning in order to isolate the complementing genomic clone (29Underhill T.M. Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Flintoff W.F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 337-349Google Scholar). Another difference in the structure of the cosmid 100-2 is shown by the change in size of the smallest fragment in the BamHI digest. This fragment is approximately 500 bp smaller in the cosmid DNA as compared to the genomic DNA. This difference is due to a deletion in intron 2 of the cosmid 100-2 (Fig. 1A). The other bands in the Southern blot analysis, including the 4.3-kb BamHI doublet and the 6.4-kb HindIII band, were comparable between the cosmid 100-2 and genomic sequences. To determine the nature of the messenger RNA produced in Pro−3 cells, a Northern blot of poly(A+) selected mRNA was probed with the cDNA sequence (Fig. 3A). The Northern analysis indicated that there were two mRNA species approximately 2.5 kb and 2.6 kb in size. The two mRNAs were present in similar amounts in Pro−3 cells, since the band intensities are comparable (Fig. 3A). Amplification of the hamster rfc gene using first-strand cDNA synthesized from Pro−3 cells confirmed the presence of two mRNA species that differed in size by 121 bp (Fig. 3B). Using PCR primers specific for the 5′ end of pMtxT9, the 121-bp difference was localized to this portion of the pMtxT9 sequence (Fig. 3C). The PCR products shown in Fig. 3, B and C, were cloned and sequenced. The sequence of the lower molecular weight species was identical to the sequence of pMtxT9. The sequence of the higher molecular weight species contained an additional 121 bp inserted at position −48, which was known to be a splice junction (Fig. 4). An oligodeoxynucleotide specific for the 121-bp sequence was used to map the new exon relative to the genomic sequence in the cosmid 100-2. This exon was labeled exon 2 and the numbering of the 5′-untranslated region of the previously reported pMtxT9 sequence (28Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Google Scholar) was changed to include the new exon (Fig. 4). Therefore the hamster rfc gene codes for two mRNA species (Fig. 1B), rfc mRNA1, which contains exons 1 through 7, and rfc mRNA2, in which exon 2 is absent.Fig. 4DNA sequences at the 5′ end of the rfc gene. Numbering on the left indicates the nucleotide position relative to the translational start site designated +1 (*). Lower case indicates the sequence of the alternatively spliced exon 2. The consensus Sp1 binding sequence is underlined. The SacII site at the beginning of the probe used for RNase protection (Fig. 5) is double underlined. The arrows above the sequence indicate the positions of the 5′-RACE products.

Thus it was anticipated that there should be no functional difference between the protein products encoded by the two messages. To confirm this, the two mRNA species were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the expression vector pCR3 (Invitrogen). The resulting RT-PCR clones were sequenced, and three clones of the large mRNA isoform, which contain the 121-bp second exon, were transfected into the mutant Pro−3 MtxRII 5-3 cell line and selected for the ability to complement the mutant phenotype. All three clones were able to rescue the phenotype at a frequency comparable to that of the cDNA clone pMtxT9, which corresponds to the mRNA2 sequence.2 This indicates that there is no apparent functional difference between the mRNA isoforms with respect to their ability to complement the mutant phenotype. To ensure that DNA fidelity was maintained during the amplification process, the sequence of the RT-PCR clones was compared to the cDNA sequence. Three sequence alterations that were presumably due to polymerase error were noted in the three RT-PCR clones. One of the three clones had no sequence alterations, while another clone had a silent mutation at base pair 780. The third clone had two point mutations, a silent mutation at base pair 1648 and a mutation at base pair 853 that resulted in the substitution of methionine for leucine at amino acid 285 in the predicted amino acid sequence. This change is relatively conservative and did not appear to affect the ability of the clone to rescue the mutant phenotype. The transcriptional start site of the hamster rfc gene was mapped using 5′-RACE and RNase protection analysis. The results of the 5′-RACE analysis are indicated in Fig. 4. Thirty-three clones were obtained and sequenced. The majority of the clones mapped to six sites near the beginning of the pMtxT9 sequence with two clones mapping to a site at base pair 53 of the putative open reading frame. RNase protection was used to confirm the location of the transcription start sites. Six RNase protection products were detected (Fig. 5) whose positions corresponded well with the 5′-RACE products near the beginning of the pMtxT9 sequence (Fig. 4). The predominant RNase protection product appears to correspond to the first base pair of the pMtxT9 clone (Fig. 4). Two minor bands were seen in the RNase protection approximately 50 bp upstream of the major RNase protection product. These bands were not very intense but may indicate that there is a low level usage of an upstream transcription start site. No 5′-RACE products corresponding to an mRNA of this size were detected. Two hundred sixty-one base pairs of sequence upstream of the major transcriptional start site from the cosmid 100-2 are also shown in Fig. 4. This sequence is consistent with a “housekeeping” gene promoter sequence in that it is fairly GC-rich, does not contain a TATA box element, and contains a consensus binding site for the Sp1 transcription factor at −346 (40Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254Google Scholar). This report describes the organization of the hamster rfc gene, the characterization of two alternatively spliced transcripts, and the identification of the transcriptional start sites. The gene is organized into seven exons and six introns. The sequences at the splice site junctions conform to the consensus GT/AG with the exception of the donor splice site of intron 3, which contains a C instead of a T at the +2 position of the intron. Although this splice site does not conform to the consensus, it appears to function efficiently in CHO cells. We have not been able to detect a splicing error at this intron/exon junction in mRNA from Pro−3 cells using RT-PCR analysis. Splicing errors at other splice site junctions do seem to occur in the hamster rfc gene. In screening the mRNA from Pro−3 cells by RT-PCR, we were able to detect a potential splice error at the splice acceptor site of exon 6. Two RT-PCR clones have been isolated that contain either a 7- or 29-bp deletion at the beginning of exon 6.2 The two deletions both begin at the first base pair of exon 6 and end after the next two downstream AG sequences, indicating that they may be cryptic splice acceptor sites. The deletions in these RT-PCR products correspond to the 29-bp deletion previously reported in Williams et al. (28Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Google Scholar) for clones pMtxT5 and pMtxT7. Since the 29-bp deletion is found in both a cDNA library and by RT-PCR analysis, there must be a proportion of mRNAs in the cell that contain the deletion. Although our PCR conditions were not quantitative, the majority of PCR products isolated did not contain the 29- or the 7-bp deletion. Another possible splicing error that involves the splice site junctions that flank exon 4 has been reported in the literature. The hamster rfc cDNA clone pMtxT5 (28Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Google Scholar) contains a 757-bp deletion which is the result of the loss of exon 4. The 3′ end of this deletion corresponds to the 3′ end of the 119-bp deletion reported by Brigle et al. (41Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Google Scholar) for the mouse rfc message. Although the intron/exon structure of the mouse rfc gene is not known, it is likely that this deletion also involves a splice site junction. In the present study, we have not been able to detect any sequence alterations that would correspond to either of the above deletions using RT-PCR analysis on mRNA from Pro−3 cells. These deletions may represent aberrantly spliced messenger RNAs that are present at very low levels and are detected due to the sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction. We have not been able to detect mRNAs containing these deletions by Northern blot analysis, although we can detect the alternatively spliced messages that only differ in size by 121 bp. All of these deletions occur at splice junctions, but it is not clear whether they are simply splice errors or if they represent another level of regulation of this gene. It should be noted that a construct containing the full-length cDNA sequence with the 29-bp deletion at the beginning of exon 6 is not able to complement our mutant cells upon transfection.2 This indicates that the protein produced from a transcript containing the 29-bp deletion is not functional, at least in our assay system. The hamster rfc gene encodes two alternatively spliced transcripts. The transcripts differ with respect to the presence or absence of a 121-bp exon in the putative 5′-untranslated region. Upon transfection, the larger mRNA isoform is able to complement the mutant phenotype at a frequency similar to the original cDNA clone pMtxT9, indicating that there is no significant functional difference between them in this assay system. Although this is the first report of an alternative splice in the rfc gene, we also see a doublet band on a Northern blot of mouse RNA.2 It will be interesting to see if the two mRNA isoforms show any differences in spatial/temporal expression or translational regulation in an intact organism. We have mapped the transcriptional start sites of the rfc gene to several positions approximately 200 bp upstream of the translational start site. The RACE data and RNase protection data taken together indicate that there are approximately six transcription start sites close to the beginning of the pMtxT9 cDNA clone. The size of transcripts generated from these start sites agree with the observed size of the rfc mRNA on a Northern blot. The use of imprecise transcriptional start sites is common in TATA-less “housekeeping” genes (40Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254Google Scholar). Two additional bands in the RNase protection assay indicate that there may be a low level usage of an upstream transcriptional start site. We have not been able to detect any 5′-RACE products that would correspond to these bands, nor do we see a larger mRNA on a Northern blot. The possible use of an upstream transcriptional start site is currently being investigated using RT-PCR. Brigle et al. (41Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Google Scholar) have shown an alignment of the translated nucleotide sequence upstream of the predicted ATG initiation codon from the CHO and L1210 rfc cDNAs. The authors point out that the degree of similarity and lack of an upstream in-frame termination codon may indicate that these sequences encode additional protein information. However, an analysis of the putative 5′-untranslated region of the human cDNA sequence, which does not contain an in-frame stop codon, revealed very little homology with the hamster or mouse sequences. This is in contrast with the amino acid sequence downstream of the putative ATG initiation codon, which is highly conserved among hamster, mouse, and human (23Williams F.M.R. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2987-2992Google Scholar). These observations combined with the transcriptional start site mapping data presented in this paper and the size of the messenger RNA on a Northern blot imply that the predicted ATG initiation codon is the major translational start site. The information obtained in these studies should prove useful for determining the state of the rfc gene in both normal and transport-deficient cell systems. We thank T. M. Underhill and P. L. Ferguson for helpful discussions."

In other systems, activation of gene expression by these agents is transcriptionally mediated. To identify transcription factors that control expression of laminin B2 chain gene, we employed a strategy consisting of a computer-based analysis of murine and human gene promoter sequences and gel shift assays. Although overall the laminin B2 chain promoters from the two species have low sequence similarity, the mouse promoter contained sequences that were also contained in one motif, 5′-CCCCGCCCACCTCGCGCGC-3′, designated bcn-1, from the human promoter. Treatment of mesangial cells with either PMA or interleukin-1β induced a transient increase in nuclear DNA binding activity, designated BCN-1, recognized the bcn-1 motif in a gel shift assay. A single nucleotide replacement in the bcn-1 motif abolished DNA binding, indicating that bcn-1·BCN-1 complex formation is highly specific. In transient transfections, the ability of PMA to induce the laminin B2 chain promoter was abolished by mutating the bcn-1 motif. These results suggest that the bcn-1 element and its cognate inducible BCN-1 protein regulate laminin B2 chain gene transcription.

Although overall the laminin B2 chain promoters from the two species have low sequence similarity, the mouse promoter contained sequences that were also contained in one motif, 5′-CCCCGCCCACCTCGCGCGC-3′, designated bcn-1, from the human promoter. Treatment of mesangial cells with either PMA or interleukin-1β induced a transient increase in nuclear DNA binding activity, designated BCN-1, recognized the bcn-1 motif in a gel shift assay. A single nucleotide replacement in the bcn-1 motif abolished DNA binding, indicating that bcn-1·BCN-1 complex formation is highly specific. In transient transfections, the ability of PMA to induce the laminin B2 chain promoter was abolished by mutating the bcn-1 motif. These results suggest that the bcn-1 element and its cognate inducible BCN-1 protein regulate laminin B2 chain gene transcription. Laminin is a major component of the glomerular basement membrane (1Timpl R. Rohde H. Robey P.G. Rennard S.I. Foidart J.M. Martin G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9933-9937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a large non-collagenous glycoprotein composed of three chains connected by an α-helical coiled-coil domain (2Hunter D.D. Shah V. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). At least five distinct chains of laminin are known to exist. The basement membrane contains only a unique set of laminin chain heterotrimers; they all contain B2 chain in a combination with either A chain or merosin and either B1 or S chain (3Martin G.R. Timpl R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 4Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2014-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stage of development (7Abrahamson D.R. John P.L.S.

Alpers C.E. Burns M.W. Pritzl P. Gordon K. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 485-497PubMed Google Scholar). The level and distribution of laminin in the glomerular basement membrane also varies with types of glomerular disease (11Matsuo S. Brentjens J.R. Andres G. Foidart J.M. Martin G.R. Martinez-Hernandez A. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 36-49PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fukatsu A. Matsuo S. Killen P.D. Martin G.R. Andres G.A. Brentjens J.R. Hum. Pathol. 1988; 19: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although it is known that an abnormal accumulation of laminin chains contributes to the progression of glomerular scarring, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased synthesis of laminin are very poorly understood. In the kidney, laminin is thought to be synthesized by both glomerular epithelial and mesangial cells (3Martin G.R. Timpl R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 13Abrahamson D.R. J. Pathol. 1986; 149: 257-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that treatment of glomerular epithelial cells with IL-1β 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1βinterleukin-1βPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateTGF-βtransforming growth factor-βPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. induced a transient increase in laminin B2 chain mRNA levels (14Richardson C.A. Gordon K.L. Couser W.G. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F273-F278PubMed Google Scholar). This increase was associated with the activation of NF-κB DNA binding activity recognized by a κB-like motif contained in the murine laminin B2 chain gene promoter (14Richardson C.A. Gordon K.L. Couser W.G. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F273-F278PubMed Google Scholar). This association suggests that production of laminin chains in glomerular cells could, in part, be transcriptionally mediated. interleukin-1β phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate transforming growth factor-β phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Promoters of a number of the laminin chain genes share similarities, suggesting that transcription of laminin chain genes is regulated by similar or overlapping mechanisms. Human and murine B1 and B2 chain promoters have no TATA or CAAT boxes, contain a number of GC boxes, κB consensus sequences, and potential Sp1 binding sites (GGGCGG) (15Vasios G.W. Gold J.D.

TATA-less promoters typically contain a number of Sp1 DNA-binding sites, and the Sp1 transcription factor is thought to play a particularly key role in the initiation of transcription of genes that contain no TATA boxes in their promoters. The human B2 promoter contains a potential AP-2 binding site (CCCCAGGC) (15Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 17Kallunki T. Ikonen J. Chow L.T. Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this or related factor along with NF-κB and Sp1 might play a role in the transcriptional control of expression of laminin genes. To gain more insight into the transcriptional regulation of laminin genes, we used a computer-based analysis to compared the sequences of the murine and the human laminin B2 chain gene promoters (17Kallunki T. Ikonen J. Chow L.T. Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ogawa K. Burbelo P.D. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

Here, we demonstrate that in mesangial cells IL-1β-, PMA-, and TGF-β- induced transient increase in laminin B2 chain mRNA levels is preceded by the induction of nuclear DNA binding activity recognized by a highly conserved enhancer element, designated bcn-1, contained within both the rodent and the human laminin B2 chain gene promoter. ds-bcn-1:5'-CCCC(G/T)CCC(A/T)CCTCGCGCGCCCCTCCC-3'(sense) 3'-GGGG(C/A)GGG(T/A)GGAGCGCGCGGGGAGGG-5'(antisense) ds-kBw:5'-CAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGAAGCT-3'(sense) 3'-GTCTCCCCTGAAAGGCTCTCCTTCGA-5'(antisense) ds-kBm:5'-CAGAGCTCACTTTCCGAGAGGAAGCT−3'(sense) 3'39-GTCTCGAGTGAAAGGCTCTCCTTCGA-5'(antisense) ds-AP1:5'59-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-5'(sense) 3'-GCGAACTACTCAGTCGGCCTT-3'(antisense) ds-AP2:5'-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3'(sense) 3'-CTAGCTTGACTGGAGGGCGCCGGGCA-5'(antisense) ds-Sp1:5'-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3'(sense) 3'-TAAGCTAGCCCCGCCCCGCTCG-5'(antisense) SEQUENCES 1-5 The rat mesangial cell line was established from collagenase-treated glomeruli, and cells were characterized as described previously (20Adler S.

Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 200 µg/ml L-glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 in air and were passaged every 5-7 days by scraping. N-[L-3-trans-Carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]agmatine and antipain dihydrochloride was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, leupeptin and PMSF from Sigma. Total RNA was extracted essentially as described previously (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, after treatment of mesangial cells (approximately 1.0 × 107 cells) with inducing agents, cells were directly lysed and denatured in 2.0 ml of RNAzol B™ (Cinna Scientific Inc., Friendswood, TX) to isolate RNA. RNA was analyzed as described previously (22Johnson R.J. Yamabe H. Chen Y.P. Campbell C. Gordon K. Baker P. Lovett D. Couser W.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: 1388-1397PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 15 µg of RNA was electrophoresed through a 1.0% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and 0.2 M MOPS, pH 7.0. The gels were run for 2 h at 100 V, and RNA was transferred overnight to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N nylon membrane; Amersham Corp.) in 10 × standard saline citrate (1 × SSC, 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate) by a rapid downward transfer system (Turboblotter; Schleicher & Schuell). RNA was fixed to the membrane by shortwave UV cross-linking (120,000 µJ/cm2). The murine laminin B2 chain cDNA (provided by Dr. Y. Yamada, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (4Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17111-17117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was labeled with 50 µCi of [32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Hybridization was conducted at 68°C for 24 h using 10 ml of Quick Hyb Solution (Stratagene, Menasha, WI)/blot, 100 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 2.0 × 106 cpm/ml labeled cDNA probe. After hybridization, the membrane was washed three times for 5 min in 2 × standard sodium phosphate-EDTA (1 × SSPE, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaHPO4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) with 0.1% SDS at room temperature and for at least 30 min until the background disappeared in 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 60°C. The membrane was autoradiographed for 3-7 days at −70°C with intensifying screens. The membranes were stripped and reprobed under identical conditions with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 28 S probe (22Johnson R.J. Yamabe H. Chen Y.P. Campbell C. Gordon K. Baker P. Lovett D. Couser W.G. J. Am.

Briefly, after treatment of mesangial cells (approximately 2.0 × 107 cells) with inducing agents, cells were washed with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM sodium molybdate, 10 mMβ-glycerol phosphate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 30 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate). Cells were lysed in 80 µl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min, and nuclei were isolated. Nuclear proteins were extracted with 80 µl of extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM sodium molybdate, 10 mMβ-glycerol phosphate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 30 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate) for 15 min. The protein concentration was measured by the Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce), and samples were stored at −70°C. Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay was performed as described previously (24Bomsztyk K. Toivola B. Emery D.W. Rooney J.W. Dower S.K. Rachie N.A. Sibley C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9413-9417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe used in gel shift assay was end-labeled with total 1.0 × 106 cpm/sample [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.2 unit/µl T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 µl with 30 µg of nuclear protein extract from mesangial cells, 8-16 ng of oligonucleotides, and 4 µg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 30 min. The 4% polyacrylamide gel (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) electrophoresis was performed at 180 V for 2 h in 0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris borate and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The double-stranded (ds) synthetic oligonucleotides containing bcn-1 and the wild-type and mutated NF-κB- (25Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H. Valentine M.A. Dower S.K. Meier K.E. Bomsztyk K. J.

Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) used in gel shift assays had the following sequences. Synthetic bcn-1 oligonucleotide was used to construct reporter plasmid containing a dimer of wild-type and mutated bcn-1 oligonucleotides. The bcn-1 dimer inserts were subcloned in the BglII and MluI sites of pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the nucleotide sequence of the inserts was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) (28Sanger F. Nicken S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). For site-directed mutagenesis of the bcn-1 motif, the rat laminin B2 chain gene promoter (−948 to −79 relative to the transcription initiation site) 2B. C. O'Neill, H. Suzuki, and K. Bomsztyk, submitted for publication. was subcloned into a luciferase reporter gene, pGL3 enhancer (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenesis of the five base pairs (see bold below) required for protein binding was performed using OuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA) with oligonuceotides mut-bcn-1·BAMH1 sense 5′-CCACCGCCCCTGGATCCTCGCGCCCTTCCC-3 and antisense 5′-GGGAAGGGCGCGAGGATCCAGGGGCGGTGG-3′. The mutation was verified by restriction analysis (a new BamHI site was created by the mutagenesis) and by direct dideoxy nucleotide sequencing with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Mesangial cells were transiently transfected using a lipofection method (29Campbell M.J. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 1027-1032PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dioleoyl-L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) and dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (Sigma) were mixed in absolute alcohol in a 0.5:1 molar ratio. Liposomes were prepared by injecting 50 µl of this lipid solution into 1.0 ml of sterile water while vortexing (1 nmol of lipid/µl of alcohol). A liposome complex was then formed with 5 µg DNA (18:1 nmol of lipid:µg of DNA) and applied directly to cells in serum-free medium for 4 h. Cells were then incubated in complete medium for 24 h. After treatment with or without an inducing agent, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 150 µl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase assay was carried out as described (30Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was quantitated for 30 s using a bioluminometer (LB9502; Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), and light units were adjusted for protein content. The means were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Fisher's test (31Wallenstein S. Zucker C.L. Fleiss J.L. Circulation Res. 1980; 47: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). In the glomerulus, laminin is a major constituent of the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane (13Abrahamson D.R. J. Pathol. 1986; 149: 257-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of laminin chain synthesis in the glomerulus are poorly understood, laminins are thought to be produced by both the mesangial and glomerular epithelial cells. To elucidate the potential mechanisms that are responsible for the regulation of laminin production in glomerular cells, we examined the expression of laminin B2 chain mRNA levels in response to treatment of mesangial cells with a number of known cytokines and mitogens. Fig. 1 illustrates an autoradiograph of a Northern blot of total RNA isolated from untreated (Control, lane 1) and treated (lanes 2-10) mesangial cells probed with either 32P-labeled murine laminin B2 chain cDNA (4Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17111-17117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (upper panel) or 32P-labeled 28 S probe (lower panel) as a loading control. TGF-β (lanes2-4), IL-1β (lanes 5-7), and PMA (lanes 8-10) induced a transient increase in the level of laminin B2 chain mRNA. With all three agents, the peak laminin B2 chain mRNA response was observed after 4 h of stimulation (compare lane 1 to lanes 3, 6, and 9 in the upper panel), and after 6 h of treatment the mRNA levels returned to baseline (compare lane 1 to lanes 4, 7, and 10 in the upper panel). In contrast to the laminin B2 chain message, the levels of 28 S RNA did not increase (lanes 1-10 in the lower panel) in response to treatment with these agents. These results are analogous to the IL-1β effects seen in glomerular epithelial cells, where IL-1β also induced a transient increase in laminin B2 chain mRNA levels but the peak effect was seen after 2 h of treatment (14Richardson C.A. Gordon K.L. Couser W.G. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F273-F278PubMed Google Scholar). In many cell systems PMA, IL-1β, and TGF-β increase message levels through transcriptional mechanisms (32Strulovici B. Daniel I.S. Oto E. Nestor J.J. Tsou A.P. Immunology. 1989; 67: 210-215PubMed Google Scholar, 33Iwasaki T. Sims J.E. Grabstein K. Dower S.K. Rachie N. Bomsztyk K. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Border W.A. Okuda S. Languino L.R. Sporn M.B. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Hence the transient increase in laminin B2 chain mRNA levels in mesangial (Fig. 1) and glomerular epithelial cells (14Richardson C.A. Gordon K.L. Couser W.G. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F273-F278PubMed Google Scholar) might, likewise, be transcriptionally mediated. To identify transcriptional elements contained within the laminin B2 chain gene promoter, we compared the human (17Kallunki T. Ikonen J. Chow L.T. Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse (18Ogawa K. Burbelo P.D. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8384-8389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequences 5′ to the first exon using the GCG program (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Although the overall promoter sequences in the two species are significantly divergent, there was a region in the human promoter (−550 to −525 relative to the first codon) that contained sequences identical or nearly identical to short regions (9-17 nucleotides long) present in the murine laminin B2 chain gene promoter (Fig. 2). We reasoned that one or more of these similar promoter motifs might have been evolutionarily conserved in order to recognize the same or related transcription factors in rodents and humans. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a double-stranded oligonucleotides that represented the human laminin B2 chain gene promoter sequence. To take into the account the two shorter murine fragments that were disparate from the human sequence at a single point, the synthetic oligonucleotide was programmed degenerate to contain either G or T at position −546, and either A or T at position −543 (human laminin B2 chain gene promoter) (17Kallunki T. Ikonen J. Chow L.T. Kallunki P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3. illustrates an autoradiograph of a gel shift assay performed on nuclear extracts from untreated and treated rat mesangial cells using as a probe the 32P-labeled, conserved double-stranded oligonucleotide motifs, 5′-CCCC(G/T)CCC(A/T)CCTCGCGCGCCCCTCCC-3′ (sense strand). Treatment of mesangial cells with 10−7M PMA (Fig. 3A) induced a transient increase in DNA binding activity recognized by this 32P-labeled probe in nuclear extracts from these cells. This motif is designated bcn-1, and its cognate protein (or protein complex) is termed BCN-1. The nuclear BCN-1 DNA binding activity peaked after 1 h of treatment with PMA (compare lane 1 to lane 2), decreased slightly after 2 h (compare lane 3 to lane 2) and diminished after 24 h of exposure of cells to PMA (compare lane 4 to lane 2). Although not as profound, qualitatively similar effects were observed after mesangial cells were treated with 10−9M IL-1β (Fig. 3B); the nuclear BCN-1 DNA binding activity peaked after 1 h of treatment (compare lane 4 to lane 1) and greatly diminished after 2 h of treatment (lane 5). Treatment of mesangial cells with either 10−10M TGF-β or 10−10M PDGF also activated nuclear BCN-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 3C), but the magnitude was not as pronounced as that seen following treatment of these cells with either IL-1β or PMA (Fig. 3, compare panel C to panels A and B). These results demonstrate that in mesangial cells PMA-, IL-1β-, or TGF-β-induced transient increase in laminin B2 chain mRNA levels (Fig. 1) is preceded by a transient increase in a nuclear DNA binding activity recognized by a conserved DNA motif present in the human and mouse laminin B2 chain gene promoter. This DNA-binding protein(s) does not bind to either sense or antisense strand of the bcn-1 motif (data not shown).Fig. 3Time course of nuclear bcn-1 binding activity in rat mesangial cells treated with PMA, IL-1β, TGF-β, and PDGF. Mesangial cells were treated either with medium alone (control), 10−10M TGF-β, 10−10M PDGF, 10−9M IL-1β, or 10−7M PMA. At given time points, nuclear proteins were extracted from mesangial cells as described in the text. Binding to the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the bcn-1 motif was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility-gel shift assay and autoradiographed. DNA-binding reaction was carried out in 20 µl containing 30 µg of nuclear protein extracts. Free probe (Free bcn-1) and a complex of bcn-1 with its cognate protein (BCN-1) are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether binding of the BCN-1 protein to the bcn-1 probe is DNA sequence-specific, nuclear proteins extracted from PMA-treated mesangial cells were incubated with the 32P-labeled bcn-1 probe in the absence (control, lane 1) or presence of increasing (lanes 2-10) concentrations of unlabeled competitor prior to analysis of DNA binding in a gel shift assay. The autoradiograph of the gel (Fig. 4A) demonstrates that binding to the 32P-labeled bcn-1 motif was effectively competed by an excess unlabeled bcn-1 DNA (compare lanes 6 and 7 to lane 1) but not by a comparable excess of oligonucleotide bearing either the wild-type or mutated κB motif (compare lanes 4 and 10 to lane 1). As a control for these experiments, we used the same nuclear extracts from PMA-treated mesangial cells but instead tested DNA binding to 32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide containing the wild-type κB (Fig. 4B) (24Bomsztyk K. Toivola B. Emery D.W. Rooney J.W. Dower S.K. Rachie N.A. Sibley C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9413-9417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alone or in the presence of an increasing excess of oligonucleotides containing either the wild-type or mutated κB (24Bomsztyk K.

Treatment of mesangial cells with PMA activates NF-κB (Fig. 8). An autoradiograph (Fig. 4B) from these competition experiments shows that the binding to the 32P-labeled NF-κB probe was effectively competed by an excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the wild-type κB motif (compare lanes 3 and 4 to lane 1), but not by a comparable amount of oligonucleotide containing either the mutated κB or the bcn-1 motif (compare lanes 6, 7, 9, and 10 to lane 1). This series of experiments demonstrated that the bcn-1 motif recognizes its cognate nuclear protein (or protein complex) in a DNA sequence-specific manner and that the BCN-1 DNA-binding protein is not the transcription factor NF-κB.Fig. 8Effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, on the activation of BCN-1 (Panel A) and NF-κB (Panel B) DNA binding activity. Mesangial cells were either untreated (lanes 1-3) or were pretreated for 1 h with 25 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) (lanes 4-6), followed by stimulation with PMA (10−7M). At given time points, cells were harvested, nuclei were isolated, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Nuclear proteins were analyzed by gel shift assay using either 32P-labeled bcn-1 (panel A) or NF-κB (panel B) probes. Unbound (free) DNA and relevant bcn-1 and κB-protein complexes are marked by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To define the nucleotide bases contained within the bcn-1 motif that mediate protein binding, we designed “mutated” bcn-1 oligonucleotides and tested their ability to recognize nuclear proteins from PMA-treated mesangial cells. Prior to synthesis and their use in gel shift assays, the designed mutated bcn-1 sequences were rechecked against sequences in the transcription data base in GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) to ensure that a known transcription factor DNA recognition site was not created. An autoradiograph of a gel shift assay of nuclear proteins extracted from PMA-treated mesangial cells using these 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides and their nucleotide sequences are shown in Fig. 5. Mutant bcn-1A (5′-CCCC-3′ motif in the coding strand (sense) located in the 3′ half of bcn-1 was converted to 5′-ATTA-3′ motif) recognized PMA-inducible nuclear DNA binding activity with kinetics and electrophoretic mobility indistinguishable from the nuclear DNA binding activity recognized by the wild-type bcn-1 motif (compare lanes 4-6 to lanes 1-3). In sharp contrast, a 32P-labeled mutant bcn-1B (5′-(A/T)CCT-3′ was converted to 5′-CTTC-3′) did not recognize any inducible nuclear DNA binding activity (compare lanes 7-9 to lanes 1-3). These gel shift assays indicate that the (A/T)CCT nucleotide stretch in the middle of the bcn-1 motif is required for the recognition of the nuclear PMA-inducible protein (or protein complex). To maximize the likelihood of identification of an inducible nuclear factor, we have initially used a preparation of degenerate synthetic oligonucleotides containing sequences that were degenerate in two positions; one position was programed to contain either G or T, and another position contained either A or T. Thus, this mixture was made up of four different sequences differing from each other by one or two nucleotide bases. To determine which sequence(s) in the degenerate mixture is responsible for the binding of the BCN-1 protein, we separately synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides representing one of the four possible bcn-1 sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2042185065,"Rod outer segments (ROS) are responsible for the visual transduction process. Rhodopsin, which constitutes 85-90% of ROS proteins, absorbs light photons, changes its conformation, and then binds to a heterotrimeric G-protein called transducin. As a consequence, transducin dissociates into Tα and Tβγ subunits. The presence in ROS of a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) stimulated by light and guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate was first demonstrated in 1987 (Jelsema, C. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 163-168). This led that author to conclude that ROS PLA2 could be involved in the phototransduction process, and raised the possibility of receptor-mediated activation of PLA2 via G-proteins in cell types other than rods. However, the biochemical characteristics and the role of this PLA2 have not been fully elucidated. We have tried to reproduce some of the results previously reported in order to further characterize this enzyme. We have found that, in our hands, there is neither light-dependent nor GTP-dependent PLA2 activity in intact purified ROS. We also failed to detect PLA1 activity in those ROS preparations. Nevertheless, we detected significant amounts of PLA2 activity in two subretinal fractions adjacent to ROS: RPE (enriched with retinal pigment epithelial cells) and P200 (presumably containing neuronal cells, Müller cells, and rod inner segments). The enzyme present both in RPE and P200 is light- and GTP-independent, Ca2+- and Mg2+-independent, and seems to be optimally active in the alkaline pH range. Our results suggest that there is, if any, vanishingly little PLA2 or PLA1 activity in intact purified ROS and that the activity levels previously reported in the literature could have been due to a contamination by either RPE or P200. This is supported by our observation that some contaminated ROS preparations were “PLA2 active.” Rod outer segments (ROS) are responsible for the visual transduction process.

ROS are thus responsible for the phototransduction process. It has been clearly shown that following absorption of light, photoexcited rhodopsin binds to and activates transducin (Tαβγ), which is a member of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein family. During the activation of transducin, the GDP molecule (normally associated with the inactive state of the protein) is exchanged for GTP. As a consequence, transducin dissociates into Tα and Tβγ subunits. Tα is well known to activate a cGMP-phosphodiesterase whose activity eventually leads to hyperpolarization of the rod through closure of Na+/Ca2+ cGMP-dependent channels (see Refs. 1Hargrave P.A.

Jelsema reported in 1987 (5Jelsema C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 163-168Google Scholar) that phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity was present in “crude ROS” and “partially purified ROS,” and that this activity was stimulated by light and a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, GTPγS. Moreover, Jelsema and Axelrod (6Jelsema C.L. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3623-3627Google Scholar) demonstrated that Tβγ was responsible for the activation of this ROS PLA2. These results led them to conclude that ROS PLA2 could be involved in the phototransduction process. However, conflicting results have been reported since that time. In fact, although Zimmerman and Keys (8Zimmerman W.F. Keys S. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 247-260Google Scholar) detected phospholipase A activity in their ROS preparations, the activity that they measured, either PLA2 or PLA1, was neither light-dependent nor GTP-dependent. It was rather stimulated by ATP and coenzyme A (CoA). Moreover, the maximum activity that they observed was approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than that reported by Jelsema (5Jelsema C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 163-168Google Scholar). In addition, Castagnet and Giusto (9Castagnet O.I. Giusto N.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 709-719Google Scholar) published data on ROS PLA2 activity but the maximum activity that they obtained was almost 3 orders of magnitude lower than that reported by Jelsema (5Jelsema C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 163-168Google Scholar). The mechanism of stimulus-response coupling between G-proteins and phospholipase A2 could be important in many cells other than the retinal rods, given the wide distribution of PLA2 in tissues (10Neagos G.R.

Moreover, the biochemical characteristics of this retinal PLA2 have not been fully studied yet and its role is still unknown. We present here results showing that two subretinal fractions, namely RPE (enriched with retinal pigment epithelial cells) and P200 (presumably containing neuronal cells, Müller cells, and rod inner segments) are rich in PLA2 activity having an alkaline pH optimum. Our results also point out that purified ROS isolated by three different methods, vortexing, homogenizing or hand shaking, are devoid of significant PLA2 activity. The varying levels of activity that have been reported in ROS preparations by the aforementioned authors (5Jelsema C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 163-168Google Scholar, 8Zimmerman W.F. Keys S. Exp.

Tris-HCl, DTT, GTP, GTPγS, and GDPβS were from Boehringer Mannheim. Heptane and diethyl ether were ACS reagent grade from Baxter, while hexane, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, and chloroform were HPLC grade from Fisher. Bio-Sil A silicic acid (100-200 mesh) was purchased from Bio-Rad. Osmium tetroxide (OsO4) was from Mecalab. Epon 812 and uranyl acetate were from Fluka. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Dark-adapted v-ROS were prepared from fresh bovine eyes kept on ice, according to the procedure of Salesse et al. (26Salesse C. Boucher F. Leblanc R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 258-266Google Scholar). ROS were broken off the retinas by vortexing (10 × 1 s) and then purified as described (26Salesse C. Boucher F. Leblanc R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 258-266Google Scholar). Purified v-ROS were assayed for purity and intactness as described below. They were either used directly for PLA2 activity measurement, processed for electron microscopy, or aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Dark-adapted h-ROS were prepared from fresh bovine eyes kept either on ice or at 15°C. Dissection was made under dim red light according to a modification of the procedure described by Feeney-Burns and Berman (27Feeney-Burns L. Berman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 95-102Google Scholar). Briefly, 64 eyes were cut along the ora serrata. The anterior segment and the vitreous were then eliminated by tilting the eyes. Eyecups were gently filled with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 11% sucrose, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7.4) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After removal of buffer A, retinas remained attached only at the optic disk and were cut with scissors. Sixteen retinas were collected in 40 ml of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, 20% sucrose, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7.4) and were either homogenized immediately or kept on ice in total darkness for about 2 h (to allow for preparation of RPE). Homogenization was done as described by Zimmerman and Godchaux (28Zimmerman W.F. Godchaux W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 52-57Google Scholar). The loose-fitting Potter-Elvehjeim homogenizer (clearance of 2 mm) was operated at 300 rpm. Six strokes (20 s/each) were used. The homogenate was then sedimented at 200 × g (4°C, 5 min; Sorvall HB4 rotor). The supernatant was collected and kept on ice while the pellet was gently resuspended by inversion in buffer B and centrifuged in the same conditions. Supernatants were pooled and further centrifuged at 7,000 × g (4°C, 6 min; Sorvall SS34 rotor). The 7,000 × g supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in buffer B with a wide mouth plastic pipette. This suspension was layered on the top of six 27-50% continuous sucrose gradients and centrifuged (140,000 × g, 4°C, 16 h; Beckman SW28 rotor). ROS bands were collected, diluted to 20% sucrose with buffer B, and pelleted (17,500 × g, 4°C, 5 min; Sorvall SS34 rotor). Purified h-ROS were resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer B and assayed for purity and intactness (see below). They were then either used directly for PLA2 activity measurement, processed for electron microscopy, or aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Dark-adapted hs-ROS were purified from fresh bovine eyes kept either on ice or at 15°C according to the procedure of McDowell and Kühn (29McDowell J.H. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4054-4060Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 retinas were gently peeled off the eyecup and rinsed with buffer C containing 45% sucrose (buffer C: 50 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0). They were then cut at the optic disk, collected in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer containing 54 ml of buffer C containing 45% sucrose, and gently hand shaken for 3 min. The suspension was centrifuged (3,000 × g, 4°C, 5 min; Sorvall SS34 rotor) and the supernatant collected (SN 3,000 × g = crude ROS). It was used as the starting material for further purification of ROS and for determination of PLA2 activity associated with particulate and soluble fractions at each purification step. The crude ROS-supernatant (SN 3,000 × g) was diluted 1:1 with buffer C and centrifuged (4,400 × g, 4°C, 7 min; Sorvall SS34 rotor). The 4,400 × g pellet (P 4,400 × g = semi-purified ROS) was resuspended in buffer C containing 25% sucrose with a wide-mouth plastic pipette and layered on the top of discontinuous sucrose gradients (27-32%). Gradients were centrifuged at 140,000 × g (4°C, 2 h; Beckman SW28 rotor). Purified diluted ROS (SN 140,000 × g) were collected at the 27-32% interface, mixed with 1 volume of buffer C and centrifuged (17,500 × g, 4°C, 5 min; Sorvall SS34 rotor). The 17,500 × g pellet (P 17,500 × g = purified concentrated hs-ROS) was resuspended in a minimum of buffer C containing 45% sucrose. hs-ROS were assayed for purity and intactness as described below. They were then either used directly for PLA2 activity measurement, processed for electron microscopy, or aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Aliquots of the 4,400 and 17,500 × g supernatants (SN 4,400 and SN 17,500 × g, respectively) were kept for measurements of rhodopsin and total protein concentrations, as well as PLA2 activity. RPE cells were purified according to a modification of the method described by Feeney-Burns and Berman (27Feeney-Burns L. Berman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 95-102Google Scholar). After the retinas were cut from the optic disc, eyecups were gently filled with buffer A containing 2 mM EGTA and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. In the next steps, eyes are treated one at a time. Buffer A-EGTA was discarded and replaced by 1 ml of buffer A. RPE cells were immediately brushed off from the choroid with a soft camel hair brush (number 12) and the suspension was aspirated with a wide-mouth plastic pipette. RPE suspension was pelleted (400 × g, 4°C, 10 min; Sorvall HB4 rotor), resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer B and either used directly or aliquoted and stored at −80°C. The pellet obtained after centrifugation of the homogenized retinas at 200 × g (see “Isolation of ROS by Homogenizing”) was used as the “P200” fraction. For some experiments, it was rehomogenized with a tight-fitting (0.5 mm clearance) Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer before use. It was either assayed directly for PLA2 activity or aliquoted and stored at −80°C. In vitro assays of PLA2 activity were performed on each type of purified ROS, using [14C]PAPC, [14C]DOPC, [14C]HAPC, or [14C]PAPE as the substrate. Radiolabeled phospholipids were evaporated under argon, resuspended in 120 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 (4.5 µCi/ml), and solubilized by sonication in a Branson sonicating bath for 5 min at 37°C. The suspension was further sonicated for 15 s with a microtip probe and then incubated for 2 h at 37°C before use to allow for reannealing (30New R.R.C. New R.R.C. Liposomes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1990: 44Google Scholar). When [14C]PAPE was used as the substrate, unlabeled DPPC (80 µg/ml) was added to [14C]PAPE before the evaporation of solvent. The sonication and incubation steps were done at 42°C. Reactions were initiated by addition of 20 µl of the sonicated radiolabeled substrate to ROS aliquots containing 20-75 µg of proteins. The buffer used was either 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 5 mM CaCl2, 30 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM NaCl, 4 mM glutathione as described by Jelsema (5Jelsema C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 163-168Google Scholar) or 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl2, 30 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, 0.25 mM CoA as described by Zimmerman and Keys (8Zimmerman W.F. Keys S. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 247-260Google Scholar). The total volume was 250 µl. Incubations were done at 37°C under either dim red light or white light (1330 lx; we used a 250 watt tungsten lamp which practically does not emit in the UV range (31Gardiner F.J. Electro-optics Handbook: A Compendium of Useful Information and Technical Data. Radio Corporation of America (RCA), U. S. A.1968: 6.12-6.14Google Scholar)). Reactions were stopped at specified times with 1.25 ml of Dole's reagent (isopropyl alcohol, n-heptane, 1 N H2SO4, 40:10:1 v/v/v). After addition of 0.75 ml of n-heptane and 0.5 ml of water, samples were vortexed and allowed to stand for 5 min for phase separation. The enzymatically released [14C] oleic or [14C]arachidonic acids were separated from unreacted substrate by elution of the heptane phase on columns containing 200 mg of dessicated Bio-Sil A silicic acid with 1 ml of diethyl ether. After addition of 7.5 ml of Econofluor-2 to the 1-ml eluates, radioactivity was measured using a Beckman scintillation counter programmed to correct for quenching and counting efficiency. PLA2 activity was expressed as nanomoles of [14C]arachidonic or [14C]oleic acid released/mg of proteins and was corrected for the dilution of the radiolabeled substrate by the endogenous unlabeled phospholipids. This was done by using a phospholipid to rhodopsin weight ratio of 1:1 (32Miljanich, G. P., (1978) Studies of the Molecular Organization of the Vertebrate Photoreceptor Membrane, Ph. D. dissertation, University of California, Santa Cruz.Google Scholar). Zero-time control values were subtracted. This method was also used to assay PLA2 activity in the particulate and soluble fractions collected during the ROS purification procedure, as well as in the RPE and P200 fractions. In these cases, we used phospholipid to protein weight ratios of 0.09:1 for RPE, which is in agreement with the data published by Berman et al. (33Berman E.R. Schwell H. Feeney L. Invest. Ophthalmol. 1974; 13: 675-687Google Scholar), and 0.35:1 for P200 (as determined in our laboratory by measuring the phosphorus content of a P200-phospholipid extract (see below)). In vitro investigations of ROS PLA2 or PLA1 activity were done by HPLC. Purified ROS were incubated at 37°C for different periods of time (0, 0.5, 10, 30, and 60 min). The endogeneous unlabeled phospholipids were the only source of substrate. Reaction was started by transferring samples from ice to 37°C. Samples were either exposed to white light (1330 lx) or a dim red light during the incubation. Reaction was stopped by cooling the tubes to 0°C and adding 0.5 ml of argon-saturated methanol/mg of ROS proteins. Phospholipids were extracted and quantitated by measuring its phosphorus content according to a modification of the procedure described by Miljanich (32Miljanich, G. P., (1978) Studies of the Molecular Organization of the Vertebrate Photoreceptor Membrane, Ph. D. dissertation, University of California, Santa Cruz.Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of the phospholipid extracts were evaporated to dryness at 110°C. Then, 750 µl of H2SO4, 1.8 M, HClO4, 7% (40:25, v/v) were added and samples were heated for 1 h at 210-220°C on an aluminum heating block with occasional shaking. After cooling to room temperature, 1 ml of ascorbate, 2%, and 1 ml of molybdate, 0.5%, were added to each tube. Tubes were vigorously vortexed and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Absorbance was read at 825 nm. Typically, 800 µg of ROS phospholipids were injected on two HPLC columns placed in tandem: 1) a 4.6 × 250-mm analytical Ultrasphere Si and 2) a 10 × 250-mm semi-preparative Ultrasphere Si (Beckman). The solvent system consisted of hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:4, v/v) with a final concentration of water increasing from 1 to 9.1%. The elution was monitored at 206 nm using a Waters M490 multi-wavelength detector. Appearance of lysophospholipid peak(s) and/or decrease in phospholipid peak height was considered to be suggestive of endogenous ROS PLA2 or PLA1 activity. The retention time of lysophospholipids that could be expected from ROS PLA2 or PLA1 activity was determined as described above with commercially available lysophospholipids. Samples of freshly purified ROS (v-ROS, h-ROS, and hs-ROS) were fixed for 1 h at 20°C in 3% glutaraldehyde in a cacodylate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4, 20% sucrose or 140 mM NaCl, 12 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2) and then washed 3 times with the buffer alone. Post-fixation was done for 30 min at 4°C in 1% OsO4 in the same buffer. After they were washed 3 times, the fixed samples were progressively dehydrated in 30, 50, 70, 85, 95, and 100% ethanol, and finally in 100% propylene oxide. Fixed and dehydrated ROS samples were then embedded in Epon 812 and stained with uranyl acetate. Rhodopsin concentration was determined according to the procedure of Raubach et al. (35Raubach R.A. Franklin L.K. Dratz E.A. Vision Res. 1974; 14: 335-337Google Scholar). Total protein concentration was determined using the Lowry protein assay kit from Sigma. ROS purity was evaluated by measuring the ratio of A280/A500 nm (26Salesse C. Boucher F. Leblanc R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 258-266Google Scholar). ROS intactness was estimated by measuring the production of NADPH as described by Schnetkamp and Daemen (36Schnetkamp P.P.M. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 672: 307-312Google Scholar). Considering the discrepancy between ROS PLA2 activity levels reported in the literature and that its role is still unknown, we have attempted to reproduce some of the reported results in order to further characterize this enzyme. We first tried to measure PLA2 activity in the conditions described by Jelsema (5Jelsema C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 163-168Google Scholar) because she reported the highest level of activity. Surprisingly, we could not detect any significant light-dependent or light-independent PLA2 activity in our ROS preparations (Fig. 1). In an attempt to detect PLA2 activity, we have tried: 1) to preincubate the eyes on ice, in total darkness, for different periods of time (1, 2, or 4 h) prior to dissection, 2) to vary the composition of the ROS purification buffer, 3) to vary the method used to either collect the retinas or detach ROS from the retina (see the three procedures for ROS isolation and purification), and 4) to use mixed substrate vesicles ([14C]PAPC + DPPC) in the activity assay, but none of these conditions allowed us to detect significant PLA2 activity in ROS. Fig. 1 shows typical results that were obtained in all those diverse conditions. We have tested ROS PLA2 activity toward other exogenous radiolabeled substrates differing from [14C]PAPC either by the type of fatty acid present in sn-1 and sn-2 positions ([14C]DOPC), the type of polar headgroup ([14C]PAPE), or the type of bond between the sn-1 fatty acid and the glycerol backbone ([14C]HAPC). Since [14C]DOPC was labeled on both fatty acid chains, it allowed for the detection of either PLA2 or PLA1 activity. However, even if we used [14C]DOPC in the same conditions as described by Zimmerman and Keys (8Zimmerman W.F. Keys S. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 247-260Google Scholar) or Jelsema (5Jelsema C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 163-168Google Scholar), we did not observe any PLA2 or PLA1 activity that could be considered significantly different from the background. In fact, as can be seen in Fig. 2, none of the substrates we used was significantly hydrolyzed by our ROS preparations. As we could not reproduce the results of Jelsema (5Jelsema C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 163-168Google Scholar) and Zimmerman and Keys (8Zimmerman W.F. Keys S. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 247-260Google Scholar), we have investigated the intactness of our ROS preparations. Using electron microscopy of freshly purified v-ROS, we found that our preparations were in fact completely burst (Fig. 3A). Since our negative results could be due to the loss of the PLA2 (or PLA1) enzyme itself or some soluble activating factors during the purification procedure, we changed our method of ROS preparation in order to get intact plasma membranes. We used homogenization (as described by Zimmerman and Godchaux (28Zimmerman W.F. Godchaux W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 52-57Google Scholar)) and hand shaking (as described by McDowell and Kühn (29McDowell J.H. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4054-4060Google Scholar)) to isolate h-ROS and hs-ROS, respectively. Fig. 3, B and C, clearly show that hand shaking gives better results; only ROS isolated by hand shaking have densely packed discs as well as a sealed plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). Moreover, we measured the production of NADPH as a quantitative criteria for evaluating the intactness of v-ROS, h-ROS, and hs-ROS. Given that the NADPH-recycling enzyme required for the reduction of rhodopsin's chromophore is cytosolic (36Schnetkamp P.P.M. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 672: 307-312Google Scholar), we measured the production of NADPH, in the presence of exogenously added substrates (D-glucose 6-phosphate +βNADP), prior to and after solubilization of ROS membranes with Triton X-100 (36Schnetkamp P.P.M. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 672: 307-312Google Scholar). The results were compared to negative controls where addition of both substrates was omitted. An increase in the absorbance at 340 nm after solubilization of the plasma membrane indicates that cytosolic NADPH-recycling enzymes were present in ROS and thus provides an indication that ROS were initially intact. Fig. 4 shows results obtained for the three types of ROS preparations. The three curves show a slow production of NADPH prior to membrane solubilization with Triton X-100. The addition of the detergent clearly leads to a large increase of NADPH production, mainly for h-ROS and hs-ROS. Obviously, v-ROS contain much less intact ROS as observed in Fig. 3A. From Fig. 3, Fig. 4, the intactness of these ROS preparations can be assessed as hs-ROS ⟩⟩ h-ROS ⟩⟩⟩⟩⟩ v-ROS. Nonetheless, no matter whether we used v-ROS, h-ROS, or hs-ROS preparations, we have failed to detect significant PLA2 activity. Fig. 1 shows typical results that we observed with each type of preparation.Fig. 4Production of NADPH in v-ROS, h-ROS, and hs-ROS. Freshly purified ROS were used. The assay was conducted in the dark as described by Schnetkamp and Daemen (36Schnetkamp P.P.M. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 672: 307-312Google Scholar). The reaction was started by adding 200 µMβNADP and 200 µMD-glucose-6-phosphate to 7.7 µM rhodopsin, in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 600 mM sucrose, 0.25% Ficoll 400, 1 mM MgCl2. The arrow indicates the time where Triton X-100 was added (0.5% final concentration). NADPH formation was determined by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm (A340). The baseline, made by omitting βNADP and D-glucose-6-phosphate, was subtracted to yield the ΔA340 nm. These results are representative of five separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further investigate the possibility that PLA2 enzymes were lost during the purification procedure, we measured PLA2 activity in the particulate and soluble fractions generated at each step of ROS purification. As can be seen in Table I, there is no significant PLA2 activity in any of these fractions. Moreover, coincubation of the corresponding pellet and supernatant obtained after the centrifugation run at either 4,400 or 17,500 × g was not sufficient to restore PLA2 activity. The only PLA2 active fraction was “P 3,000 × g” which is equivalent to the P200 fraction (presumed to contain neuronal cells, Müller cells, and"
