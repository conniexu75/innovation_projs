https://openalex.org/W2061820211,"The shapes of noble metal nanocrystals (NCs) are usually defined by polyhedra that are enclosed by {111} and {100} facets, such as cubes, tetrahedra, and octahedra. Platinum NCs of unusual tetrahexahedral (THH) shape were prepared at high yield by an electrochemical treatment of Pt nanospheres supported on glassy carbon by a square-wave potential. The single-crystal THH NC is enclosed by 24 high-index facets such as {730}, {210}, and/or {520} surfaces that have a large density of atomic steps and dangling bonds. These high-energy surfaces are stable thermally (to 800 degrees C) and chemically and exhibit much enhanced (up to 400%) catalytic activity for equivalent Pt surface areas for electro-oxidation of small organic fuels such as formic acid and ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1968937229,"Many potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease target amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), which are widely presumed to cause the disease. The microtubule-associated protein tau is also involved in the disease, but it is unclear whether treatments aimed at tau could block Aβ-induced cognitive impairments. Here, we found that reducing endogenous tau levels prevented behavioral deficits in transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein, without altering their high Aβ levels. Tau reduction also protected both transgenic and nontransgenic mice against excitotoxicity. Thus, tau reduction can block Aβ- and excitotoxin-induced neuronal dysfunction and may represent an effective strategy for treating Alzheimer's disease and related conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2010807493,"The distinguishing feature of adult stem cells is their extraordinary capacity to divide prior to the onset of senescence. While stratified epithelia such as skin, prostate, and breast are highly regenerative and account disproportionately for human cancers, genes essential for the proliferative capacity of their stem cells remain unknown. Here we analyze p63, a gene whose deletion in mice results in the catastrophic loss of all stratified epithelia. We demonstrate that p63 is strongly expressed in epithelial cells with high clonogenic and proliferative capacity and that stem cells lacking p63 undergo a premature proliferative rundown. Additionally, we show that p63 is dispensable for both the commitment and differentiation of these stem cells during tissue morphogenesis. Together, these data identify p63 as a key, lineage-specific determinant of the proliferative capacity in stem cells of stratified epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2126229620,"ThermoTRPs, a subset of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family of cation channels, have been implicated in sensing temperature. TRPM8 and TRPA1 are both activated by cooling; however, it is unclear whether either ion channel is required for thermosensation in vivo. We show that mice lacking TRPM8 have severe behavioral deficits in response to cold stimuli. In thermotaxis assays of temperature gradient and two-temperature choice assays, TRPM8-deficient mice exhibit strikingly reduced avoidance of cold temperatures. TRPM8-deficient mice also lack behavioral response to cold-inducing icilin application and display an attenuated response to acetone, an unpleasant cold stimulus. However, TRPM8-deficient mice have normal nociceptive-like responses to subzero centigrade temperatures, suggesting the presence of at least one additional noxious cold receptor. Finally, we show that TRPM8 mediates the analgesic effect of moderate cooling after administration of formalin, a painful stimulus. Therefore, depending on context, TRPM8 contributes to sensing unpleasant cold stimuli or mediating the effects of cold analgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2092166214,"Thermosensation is an essential sensory function that is subserved by a variety of transducer molecules, including those from the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channel superfamily. One of its members, TRPM8 (CMR1), a ligand-gated, nonselective cation channel, is activated by both cold and chemical stimuli in vitro. However, its roles in cold thermosensation and pain in vivo have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that sensory neurons derived from TRPM8 null mice lack detectable levels of TRPM8 mRNA and protein and that the number of these neurons responding to cold (18 degrees C) and menthol (100 microM) is greatly decreased. Furthermore, compared with WT mice, TRPM8 null mice display deficiencies in certain behaviors, including icilin-induced jumping and cold sensation, as well as a significant reduction in injury-induced responsiveness to acetone cooling. These results suggest that TRPM8 may play an important role in certain types of cold-induced pain in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2094589586,"Molecular mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock have been studied primarily by genetic perturbation and behavioral analysis. Here, we used bioluminescence imaging to monitor Per2 gene expression in tissues and cells from clock mutant mice. We discovered that Per1 and Cry1 are required for sustained rhythms in peripheral tissues and cells, and in neurons dissociated from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Per2 is also required for sustained rhythms, whereas Cry2 and Per3 deficiencies cause only period length defects. However, oscillator network interactions in the SCN can compensate for Per1 or Cry1 deficiency, preserving sustained rhythmicity in mutant SCN slices and behavior. Thus, behavior does not necessarily reflect cell-autonomous clock phenotypes. Our studies reveal previously unappreciated requirements for Per1, Per2, and Cry1 in sustaining cellular circadian rhythmicity and demonstrate that SCN intercellular coupling is essential not only to synchronize component cellular oscillators but also for robustness against genetic perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2039019529,"Precision measurements are important across all fields of science. In particular, optical phase measurements can be used to measure distance, position, displacement, acceleration, and optical path length. Quantum entanglement enables higher precision than would otherwise be possible. We demonstrated an optical phase measurement with an entangled four-photon interference visibility greater than the threshold to beat the standard quantum limit—the limit attainable without entanglement. These results open the way for new high-precision measurement applications."
https://openalex.org/W2023356290,"Nanowires are conventionally assumed to grow via the vapor-liquid-solid process, in which material from the vapor is incorporated into the growing nanowire via a liquid catalyst, commonly a low–melting point eutectic alloy. However, nanowires have been observed to grow below the eutectic temperature, and the state of the catalyst remains controversial. Using in situ microscopy, we showed that, for the classic Ge/Au system, nanowire growth can occur below the eutectic temperature with either liquid or solid catalysts at the same temperature. We found, unexpectedly, that the catalyst state depends on the growth pressure and thermal history. We suggest that these phenomena may be due to kinetic enrichment of the eutectic alloy composition and expect these results to be relevant for other nanowire systems."

We examined the fate of coral reef fish larvae produced at a small island reserve, using a mass-marking method based on maternal transmission of stable isotopes to offspring. Approximately 60% of settled juveniles were spawned at the island, for species with both short (<2 weeks) and long (>1 month) pelagic larval durations. If natal homing of larvae is a common life-history strategy, the appropriate spatial scales for the management and conservation of coral reefs are likely to be much smaller than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2119856466,"To support the role of DISC1 in human psychiatric disorders, we identified and analyzed two independently derived ENU-induced mutations in Exon 2 of mouse Disc1. Mice with mutation Q31L showed depressive-like behavior with deficits in the forced swim test and other measures that were reversed by the antidepressant bupropion, but not by rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor. In contrast, L100P mutant mice exhibited schizophrenic-like behavior, with profound deficits in prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition that were reversed by antipsychotic treatment. Both mutant DISC1 proteins exhibited reduced binding to the known DISC1 binding partner PDE4B. Q31L mutants had lower PDE4B activity, consistent with their resistance to rolipram, suggesting decreased PDE4 activity as a contributory factor in depression. This study demonstrates that Disc1 missense mutations in mice give rise to phenotypes related to depression and schizophrenia, thus supporting the role of DISC1 in major mental illness."
https://openalex.org/W1970302470,"The polarization of axon and dendrites underlies the ability of neurons to integrate and transmit information in the brain. We show here that the serine/threonine kinase LKB1, previously implicated in the establishment of epithelial polarity and control of cell growth, is required for axon specification during neuronal polarization in the mammalian cerebral cortex. LKB1 polarizing activity requires its association with the pseudokinase Stradalpha and phosphorylation by kinases such as PKA and p90RSK, which transduce neurite outgrowth-promoting cues. Once activated, LKB1 phosphorylates and thereby activates SAD-A and SAD-B kinases, which are also required for neuronal polarization in the cerebral cortex. SAD kinases, in turn, phosphorylate effectors such as microtubule-associated proteins that implement polarization. Thus, we provide evidence in vivo and in vitro for a multikinase pathway that links extracellular signals to the intracellular machinery required for axon specification."

https://openalex.org/W2168486424,"Although NAD(+) biosynthesis is required for Sir2 functions and replicative lifespan in yeast, alterations in NAD(+) precursors have been reported to accelerate aging but not to extend lifespan. In eukaryotes, nicotinamide riboside is a newly discovered NAD(+) precursor that is converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide by specific nicotinamide riboside kinases, Nrk1 and Nrk2. In this study, we discovered that exogenous nicotinamide riboside promotes Sir2-dependent repression of recombination, improves gene silencing, and extends lifespan without calorie restriction. The mechanism of action of nicotinamide riboside is totally dependent on increased net NAD(+) synthesis through two pathways, the Nrk1 pathway and the Urh1/Pnp1/Meu1 pathway, which is Nrk1 independent. Additionally, the two nicotinamide riboside salvage pathways contribute to NAD(+) metabolism in the absence of nicotinamide-riboside supplementation. Thus, like calorie restriction in the mouse, nicotinamide riboside elevates NAD(+) and increases Sir2 function."

To this end, superconducting circuits allow for a high degree of flexibility. We report on the time-domain tunable coupling of optimally biased superconducting flux qubits. By modulating the nonlinear inductance of an additional coupling element, we parametrically induced a two-qubit transition that was otherwise forbidden. We observed an on/off coupling ratio of 19 and were able to demonstrate a simple quantum protocol."

https://openalex.org/W2050642338,"Axon/dendrite differentiation is a critical step in neuronal development. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the accumulation of LKB1 and STRAD, two interacting proteins critical for establishing epithelial polarity, in an undifferentiated neurite correlates with its subsequent axon differentiation. Downregulation of either LKB1 or STRAD by siRNAs prevented axon differentiation, and overexpression of these proteins led to multiple axon formation. Furthermore, interaction of STRAD with LKB1 promoted LKB1 phosphorylation at a PKA site S431 and elevated the LKB1 level, and overexpressing LKB1 with a serine-to-alanine mutation at S431 (LKB1S431A) prevented axon differentiation. In developing cortical neurons in vivo, downregulation of LKB1 or overexpression of LKB1S431A also abolished axon formation. Finally, local exposure of the undifferentiated neurite to brain-derived neurotrophic factor or dibutyryl-cAMP promoted axon differentiation in a manner that depended on PKA-dependent LKB1 phosphorylation. Thus local LKB1/STRAD accumulation and PKA-dependent LKB1 phosphorylation represents an early signal for axon initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2156453746,"Dendrites distinguish between sister branches and those of other cells. Self-recognition can often lead to repulsion, a process termed “self-avoidance.” Here we demonstrate that dendrite self-avoidance in Drosophila da sensory neurons requires cell-recognition molecules encoded by the Dscam locus. By alternative splicing, Dscam encodes a vast number of cell-surface proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily. We demonstrate that interactions between identical Dscam isoforms on the cell surface underlie self-recognition, while the cytoplasmic tail converts this recognition to dendrite repulsion. Sister dendrites expressing the same isoforms engage in homophilic repulsion. By contrast, Dscam diversity ensures that inappropriate repulsive interactions between dendrites sharing the same receptive field do not occur. The selectivity of Dscam-mediated cell interactions is likely to be widely important in the developing fly nervous system, where processes of cells must distinguish between self and nonself during the construction of neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2162281220,"Via its extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD), the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 promotes the formation and growth of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons. Here we show that the first N-terminal 92 amino acids of the extracellular domain are necessary and sufficient for GluR2′s spine-promoting activity. Moreover, overexpression of this extracellular domain increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Biochemically, the NTD of GluR2 can interact directly with the cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin, in cis or in trans. N-cadherin-coated beads recruit GluR2 on the surface of hippocampal neurons, and N-cadherin immobilization decreases GluR2 lateral diffusion on the neuronal surface. RNAi knockdown of N-cadherin prevents the enhancing effect of GluR2 on spine morphogenesis and mEPSC frequency. Our data indicate that in hippocampal neurons N-cadherin and GluR2 form a synaptic complex that stimulates presynaptic development and function as well as promoting dendritic spine formation."

The measurements show that the planet exhibits librations in longitude that are forced at the 88-day orbital period, as predicted by theory. The large amplitude of the oscillations, 35.8 ± 2 arc seconds, together with the Mariner 10 determination of the gravitational harmonic coefficient C 22 , indicates that the mantle of Mercury is decoupled from a core that is at least partially molten."
https://openalex.org/W1991021907,"Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved and have intriguing expression patterns. Tissue and/or time-specific expressions of some miRNAs are presumably controlled by unique cis-acting regulatory elements that coevolved with the miRNA sequences. Exploiting bioinformatics, we identified several miRNAs whose primary transcripts could be regulated by conserved genomic elements proximal to their transcription start sites. Such miRNAs include microRNA-223 (miR-223), which is reportedly controlled by a unique regulatory mechanism during granulopoiesis. Here, we define a mechanism distinct from that previously proposed to regulate miR-223 expression. We find that the mir-223 gene resembles a ""myeloid gene"" and might be driven by the myeloid transcription factors, PU.1 and C/EBPs. This mechanism is specified by the conserved proximal cis-regulatory element and might be common among different species. Hence, it needs to be considered that two distinct mechanisms that would play critical roles in myeloid functions and differentiation are actually concerned with the regulation of miR-223."
https://openalex.org/W1977190827,"beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs), prototypic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), play a critical role in regulating numerous physiological processes. The GPCR kinases (GRKs) curtail G-protein signaling and target receptors for internalization. Nitric oxide (NO) and/or S-nitrosothiols (SNOs) can prevent the loss of beta-AR signaling in vivo, but the molecular details are unknown. Here we show in mice that SNOs increase beta-AR expression and prevent agonist-stimulated receptor downregulation; and in cells, SNOs decrease GRK2-mediated beta-AR phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of beta-arrestin to the receptor, resulting in the attenuation of receptor desensitization and internalization. In both cells and tissues, GRK2 is S-nitrosylated by SNOs as well as by NO synthases, and GRK2 S-nitrosylation increases following stimulation of multiple GPCRs with agonists. Cys340 of GRK2 is identified as a principal locus of inhibition by S-nitrosylation. Our studies thus reveal a central molecular mechanism through which GPCR signaling is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2084627891,"Synaptic activity regulates the postsynaptic accumulation of AMPA receptors over timescales ranging from minutes to days. Indeed, the regulated trafficking and mobility of GluR1 AMPA receptors underlies many forms of synaptic potentiation at glutamatergic synapses throughout the brain. However, the basis for synapse-specific accumulation of GluR1 is unknown. Here we report that synaptic activity locally immobilizes GluR1 AMPA receptors at individual synapses. Using single-molecule tracking together with the silencing of individual presynaptic boutons, we demonstrate that local synaptic activity reduces diffusional exchange of GluR1 between synaptic and extraynaptic domains, resulting in postsynaptic accumulation of GluR1. At neighboring inactive synapses, GluR1 is highly mobile with individual receptors frequently escaping the synapse. Within the synapse, spontaneous activity confines the diffusional movement of GluR1 to restricted subregions of the postsynaptic membrane. Thus, local activity restricts GluR1 mobility on a submicron scale, defining an input-specific mechanism for regulating AMPA receptor composition and abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2117983207,"After unilateral stroke, the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in the intact hemisphere is often more active during movement of an affected limb. Whether this contributes to motor recovery is unclear. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate short-term reorganization in right PMd after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) disrupted the dominant left PMd, which is specialized for action selection. Even when 1 Hz left PMd TMS had no effect on behavior, there was a compensatory increase in activity in right PMd and connected medial premotor areas. This activity was specific to task periods of action selection as opposed to action execution. Compensatory activation changes were both functionally specific and anatomically specific: the same pattern was not seen after TMS of left sensorimotor cortex. Subsequent TMS of the reorganized right PMd did disrupt performance. Thus, this pattern of functional reorganization has a causal role in preserving behavior after neuronal challenge. After unilateral stroke, the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in the intact hemisphere is often more active during movement of an affected limb. Whether this contributes to motor recovery is unclear.

Subsequent TMS of the reorganized right PMd did disrupt performance. Thus, this pattern of functional reorganization has a causal role in preserving behavior after neuronal challenge. Following unilateral brain damage, for example after stroke, retained and recovered use of the affected limb is frequently associated with increased activation of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in the intact hemisphere (Gerloff et al., 2006Gerloff C. Bushara K. Sailer A. Wassermann E.M. Chen R. Matsuoka T. Waldvogel D. Wittenberg G.F. Ishii K. Cohen L.G. Hallett M.

Two types of ipsilateral reorganization in congenital hemiparesis: a TMS and fMRI study.Brain. 2002; 125: 2222-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The functional importance of such changes, however, can be difficult to interpret. Increased activation in the intact hemisphere is prominent in patients with poor motor recovery (Ward et al., 2006Ward N.S. Newton J.M. Swayne O.B. Lee L. Thompson A.J. Greenwood R.J. Rothwell J.C. Frackowiak R.S. Motor system activation after subcortical stroke depends on corticospinal system integrity.Brain. 2006; 129: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). It may therefore simply reflect the removal of transcallosal inhibition from the damaged hemisphere (Shimizu et al., 2002Shimizu T. Hosaki A. Hino T. Sato M. Komori T. Hirai S. Rossini P.M. Motor cortical disinhibition in the unaffected hemisphere after unilateral cortical stroke.Brain. 2002; 125: 1896-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, TMS-induced disruption of newly emergent activity in the intact PMd impairs recovered movement of the stroke-affected hand (Lotze et al., 2006Lotze M. Markert J. Sauseng P. Hoppe J. Plewnia C. Gerloff C. The role of multiple contralesional motor areas for complex hand movements after internal capsular lesion.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6096-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), particularly in poorly recovered patients (Johansen-Berg et al., 2002Johansen-Berg H. Rushworth M.F.S. Bogdanovic M.D. Kischka U. Wimalaratna S. Matthews P.M. The role of ipsilateral premotor cortex in hand movement after stroke.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 14518-14523Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), suggesting that such activity is functionally relevant. An alternative way to investigate the functional importance of new PMd activity is to assess its functional specificity. If we were to examine subjects in whom only a small part of the motor system was compromised, we might predict that induced compensatory changes would be specific to those functions that are normally mediated by the compromised area. Normally, PMd is important for action selection and the left PMd (lPMd) plays the dominant role (Amiez et al., 2006Amiez C. Kostopoulos P. Champod A.S. Petrides M.

Therefore, if neural activity in lPMd were to be perturbed, we might expect compensatory changes to occur in the right PMd and perhaps some other premotor areas. Such changes, however, might only be expected during action selection, the process for which lPMd is normally specialized. Rather than studying patients, the present study used repetitive TMS to induce mild and transient disruption to a focal cortical area and fMRI to image resulting compensatory changes elsewhere in the brain. The combined TMS/fMRI approach enabled experimental control over the focality, onset, and duration of neural interference, unconfounded by variations in lesion size or location, symptom severity, or diaschisis. Further, it provided information about the immediate impact of neural disruption on activity in connected brain regions. Healthy individuals acted as their own controls, thus providing more closely matched baseline data than might be possible with patients. To investigate the issue of functional reorganization, we combined an action selection task with low-frequency offline TMS. Experiment 1 tested whether fifteen minutes of 1 Hz TMS of lPMd would affect subsequent performance on an action selection task, or alter corticospinal excitability, as assessed by a single-pulse TMS test. Corticospinal excitability was suppressed. Performance was also disrupted immediately (<4 min) after TMS, but there was no such deficit during later testing (>4 min). The short-lived behavioral deficit suggested that a process of adaptive compensation might have intervened. Experiment 2 therefore used fMRI to test the hypothesis that TMS-induced disruption of lPMd would induce a compensatory increase in activation of the right PMd and other premotor areas, which would be specific to the process of action selection. Because our results confirmed this hypothesis, in Experiment 3 we stimulated left sensorimotor cortex (SM) to establish the anatomical specificity of the pattern of compensatory change. Finally, in Experiment 4, we showed that this pattern of reorganization causally mediates preserved performance. Prior to 1 Hz TMS of lPMd, stimulation of the right PMd had no effect on action selection performance. However, after 1 Hz TMS induced compensatory reorganization, stimulation of the right PMd caused a behavioral deficit. Experiment 1a examined the effect of offline 1 Hz TMS of lPMd on the subsequent performance of two behavioral tasks (Figure 1A). The “select” task emphasized the selection of action: subjects had to select a different button press response on each trial, according to the identity of a visual cue. A small circle or large square instructed an index finger response, while a large circle or small square instructed a middle finger response. The fact that neither size nor shape instructed responses in a simple way meant that actions had to be selected with care, even after practice. By contrast, the “execute” task de-emphasized action selection: subjects made the same finger movement on every trial regardless of which visual cue was presented. The execute task enabled us to effectively distinguish selection-related from movement-related activity and thus test the functional specificity of our TMS effects. In several previous studies, it has been shown that PMd, especially lPMd, is more active during the select than the execute task, and that TMS of lPMd has an effect on the select task but little impact on the execute task (Johansen-Berg et al., 2002Johansen-Berg H.

In the experimental select task, subjects pressed button 1 (index finger) in response to a large square or a small circle and button 2 (middle finger) in response to a large circle or a small square. In the control execute task, subjects pressed the same button with the same finger in response to every shape. (B) TMS/MEP design. In Experiment 1, subjects performed one block each of the select (S) and execute (E) tasks, after which the baseline motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude was measured. This was followed by 1 Hz TMS of lPMd (15 min). MEPs were remeasured (1) immediately post-TMS, (2) after 7.5 min, and (3) after 15 min. In each interval between MEP measurements, subjects performed one block of each task. Block order was counterbalanced across subjects. Task performance was measured pre- and post-TMS. (C) TMS/fMRI design. Subjects underwent two fMRI sessions, one of which was preceded by 15 min of 1 Hz TMS to lPMd (Experiment 2) or a control site in left sensorimotor (lSM) cortex (Experiment 3).

During each fMRI session, subjects performed alternating blocks of the select and execute tasks interleaved with rest blocks in which they passively viewed the stimuli.

We compared subjects' performance on both tasks before and after 15 min of 1 Hz TMS was applied offline (while no task was being performed) to lPMd (Figures 1B and 1D). There was no measurable change in select task performance after 1 Hz TMS. A repeated measures ANOVA of reaction times (RTs) with two levels of task (select, execute) and four levels of TMS (pre-TMS and post-TMS tests 1, 2, and 3) revealed a main effect of task, with longer RTs on the select than the execute task (F(1,6) = 84.335, p < 0.001). There was, however, no main effect or interaction of TMS (p > 0.1). A similar error analysis also showed no effect of TMS. However, since task periods were interleaved with periods of motor-evoked potential (MEP) recording (Figure 1B), behavioral testing only began ca. 4 min after TMS. To test whether there might be a behavioral deficit immediately after TMS, we performed another experiment (1b), in which subjects performed the select task for ca. 4 min immediately before and after 1 Hz TMS. RTs were significantly delayed after TMS in all subjects (t(6) = −4.809, p = 0.003; Figure 2A). Importantly, this shows that 1 Hz TMS disrupted the function of action selection, detectable as a behavioral deficit in the immediate poststimulation period (<4 min). However, there was no such deficit when testing occurred later (>4 min after TMS). This suggests that, at least for a task of this complexity and TMS of this intensity, the functional disruption caused by lPMd TMS recovers quickly, implicating a process of adaptive compensation. (A) Select task RTs were delayed immediately (<4 min) after 1 Hz lPMd TMS. (B) MEPs were measured before and after 1 Hz TMS, interleaved with blocks of the select and execute tasks. The peak-to-peak amplitude (mV) of MEPs from left M1 was suppressed after 1 Hz TMS of lPMd. (C) A control experiment without task blocks replicated the effect. (D) A control experiment applied 1 Hz TMS to left sensorimotor cortex and had no effect on MEPs. (∗p < 0.05, error bars = 1 SEM). In Experiment 1a, the effect of 1 Hz lPMd TMS on corticospinal excitability was assessed using a technique devised by Gerschlager et al., 2001Gerschlager W. Siebner H.R. Rothwell J.C. Decreased corticospinal excitability after subthreshold 1 Hz rTMS over lateral premotor cortex.Neurology. 2001; 57: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar (see also Rizzo et al., 2004Rizzo V. Siebner H.R. Modugno N. Pesenti A. Munchau A. Gerschlager W. Webb R.M. Rothwell J.C. Shaping the excitability of human motor cortex with premotor rTMS.J. Physiol. 2004; 554: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Single TMS pulses were applied to left primary motor cortex (lM1), and MEPs were measured before and after 1 Hz offline TMS (15 min) of lPMd. MEP measurements were interleaved with the behavioral measurements described above in the same group of subjects (Figure 1B). Although a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with four levels of TMS (pre-TMS, post-TMS 1, 2, 3) was not significant (F(3,21) = 1.215, p = 0.329), planned contrasts showed that MEP amplitude was significantly reduced immediately after TMS compared to the pre-TMS baseline (F(1,7) = 6.166, p = 0.042; Figure 2B). MEP amplitude at post-TMS intervals 2 and 3 (7.5 and 15 min after 1 Hz TMS) was also lower than the pre-TMS baseline, but the difference was smaller and not significant (p > 0.4). We ran two control experiments. Experiment 1c ruled out the possibility that the change in MEP amplitude was an artifact of an inflated pre-TMS baseline caused by muscle use during task performance. We repeated the experiment without task blocks in a new group of subjects. There was a main effect of TMS (F(3,12) = 9.744, p = 0.002). Planned contrasts showed that MEPs were suppressed immediately after TMS (p = 0.006) and at the second (p = 0.035) and third post-TMS intervals (p = 0.055), ruling out that critique (Figure 2C). Control Experiment 1d again replicated Gerschlager et al., 2001Gerschlager W. Siebner H.R. Rothwell J.C. Decreased corticospinal excitability after subthreshold 1 Hz rTMS over lateral premotor cortex.Neurology. 2001; 57: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar by showing that MEP suppression was a specific effect of stimulation at that anatomical site, lPMd, and not merely an effect mediated by current spread to lM1. We applied the same TMS protocol without a task to left sensorimotor (lSM) cortex. There was no effect on MEPs (F(3,12) = 0.449, p = 0.723; Figure 2D). To confirm that the effect of TMS at each anatomical site differed significantly, we normalized the MEPs for analysis (% change from baseline). There was a main effect of TMS site (F(1,8) = 9.713, p = 0.014) and MEPs at the first post-TMS interval also differed significantly (t(8) = −3.035, p = 0.016). In combination, experiments 1a–1d confirm that our 1 Hz lPMd TMS protocol both disrupted the function of action selection, and exerted an anatomically specific, suppressive effect on left motor corticospinal excitability. The absence of a behavioral deficit beyond the immediate poststimulation period (>4 min) suggests that compensatory changes elsewhere in the brain may mediate behavioral recovery after 1 Hz TMS. Experiment 2 used fMRI to identify where compensatory changes were occurring. In Experiment 2, subjects performed the select and execute tasks interleaved with rest periods while fMRI was used to measure changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Two fMRI data sets were acquired: one before (pre-TMS) and one after (post-TMS) 1 Hz offline TMS (15 min) was applied to lPMd. To control for potential order or learning confounds, the order of the pre-TMS and post-TMS scans was counterbalanced across subjects, so that half the subjects participated in the post-TMS session prior to the pre-TMS session (Figure 1C). In the post-TMS fMRI session, 4 min elapsed between the end of TMS and the start of image acquisition. Based on experiments 1a and 1b, we therefore expected that any behavioral deficit induced by the TMS would have recovered by the time of scanning. Consistent with this, an analysis of behavioral RT confirmed that TMS did not disrupt performance of the select task (Figure 3). Although there was a main effect of task (p < 0.001) and a significant TMS ∗ task interaction (F(1,9) = 6.28, p = 0.034), there was no evidence for a slowing of RT in the select task: if anything subjects were slightly but nonsignificantly faster after TMS (p > 0.18). The TMS ∗ task interaction was driven by the fact that after TMS there was also a tendency to perform the execute task more slowly, but the simple main effect was only marginally significant (F(1,9) = 3.945, p = 0.078). Block-by-block analyses found no evidence of learning within or across the two scan sessions (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), nor was there any evidence of a behavioral deficit in the first blocks of the post-TMS session. Graph shows mean reaction time (RT) data for the execute and select tasks from the two fMRI sessions (pre- and post-TMS) of Experiment 2. RTs were longer on the select task. There was no effect of 1 Hz TMS of lPMd on task performance during this period (>4 min after 1 Hz TMS). Error bars = 1 SEM. In the pre-TMS session, subjects activated the expected left hemisphere dominant premotor-parietal network more during performance of the select than the execute task (Figure 4; Table S1). There was bilateral activation along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and in PMd and additional activity in the cerebellum and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Consistent with previous reports, activity was more spatially extended in the left hemisphere (Figure 4), although the trend toward higher activity in left than right PMd did not reach significance (Figure S2). Several authors have shown that the network of areas revealed by this and similar contrasts mediates action selection (Amiez et al., 2006Amiez C. Kostopoulos P. Champod A.S. Petrides M.

During select as opposed to execute task performance (select > execute), subjects activated a bilateral premotor-parietal network. There was a trend toward stronger and more spatially extended activity in left PMd (crosshairs) than right PMd. An analysis of the interaction between task (select > execute) and TMS (post-TMS > pre-TMS) allowed us to look for an effect of lPMd TMS on activity in the action selection network. As predicted, lPMd TMS was followed by a task-specific increase in activation of the right PMd (rPMd). Significant activation change was also prominent in the right cingulate motor area (rCMA) and, though of smaller extent, there was also significantly increased activation in the left supplementary motor area (lSMA) and left CMA (lCMA) (Figure 5; Table S2). Since the activation change in right primary motor cortex (rM1) was a decrease in deactivation, which is difficult to interpret, we do not discuss it further. A parallel analysis using the same factor of TMS and an execute > rest task comparison did not identify any activation changes specific to the execute condition. A whole-brain random-effects analysis showed that lPMd TMS induced increased activation that was most prominent in rPMd and the rCMA. Additional changes were seen in rM1, the lSMA, and the lCMA. For each of these regions, the graphs show mean percent BOLD signal change (%BSC) values for each task (select/execute) and TMS condition (pre-/post-TMS). Note that the TMS-induced activation increases are specific to the process of action selection. White bars = execute; black bars = select. Error bars = 1 SEM. To clarify the nature of the activation increases, spherical region of interest (ROI) masks were centered on the peaks of each of the five activation clusters and mean percent BOLD signal change values in these ROIs were calculated. In case there were changes in activation over time, both pre-TMS and post-TMS fMRI periods were divided into three 5 min time blocks for analysis. To confirm that the activation increases were task specific, signal change values for the select and execute tasks were contrasted across conditions using repeated measures ANOVA (site ∗ TMS ∗ task ∗ time). Each of the four main effects was significant (all p < 0.026). There was also a significant interaction of TMS ∗ task (F(1,10) = 15.055, p = 0.003), indicating that the effects of TMS were task dependent. The critical task was the select task; two separate follow-up ANOVAs (site ∗ TMS ∗ time) showed an effect of TMS on signal change in the select (F(1,10) =18.361, p = 0.002) but not in the execute task (F(1,10) = 0.173, p = 0.686). This analysis thus confirmed the functional specificity of the TMS effect. Following lPMd TMS, there was increased activation of four regions in the action selection network (rPMd, lSMA, rCMA, lCMA, and a decrease in deactivation in rM1), which was specific to periods when subjects were performing the task emphasizing action selection, rather than repetitive execution of the same movement. The lack of any significant interactions involving TMS and time suggested that the impact of TMS on the five areas of activation change did not change significantly over the three 5 min time blocks. Neither a whole-brain nor an ROI analysis revealed evidence for task-related activation changes in the area underneath the PMd TMS coil. There was also no evidence of TMS-induced deactivation elsewhere in the brain. While task-related activation changes in the stimulated cortex might reasonably be expected, the TMS/fMRI literature is consistent in reporting no such changes after subthreshold TMS (e.g., Rounis et al., 2006Rounis E. Stephan K.E. Lee L. Siebner H.R. Pesenti A. Friston K.J. Rothwell J.C. Frackowiak R.S. Acute changes in frontoparietal activity after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a cued reaction time task.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9629-9638Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The question of why this is the case, and the implications it raises for interpreting TMS effects, requires further investigation (see Supplemental Data for further discussion of this issue). In addition to the factorial analysis described above, we also used a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis (Friston et al., 1997Friston K.J. Buechel C. Fink G.R. Morris J. Rolls E. Dolan R.J. Psychophysiological and modulatory interactions in neuroimaging.Neuroimage. 1997; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar) to identify areas of the action selection network in which the correlation with lPMd activity changed as a function of both Task and TMS. In other words, the analysis identified areas in which the BOLD signal was predicted by the interaction between activity in lPMd, the select > execute task contrast, and the pre-TMS versus post-TMS contrasts. It should be noted that a PPI analysis and a factorial analysis are differentially sensitive. Whereas the factorial analysis detects a mean change in task-specific activity after TMS, the PPI analysis identifies areas that show a change in correlation with the TMS-induced activity change in lPMd. Hence, areas of increased activity after TMS need not be identified by the PPI analysis, so long as the time course of activity in that region does not change its correlation with lPMd. We restricted the PPI analysis to a liberal mask of the action selection network, defined as all voxels activated during the select task (pre-TMS select > rest contrast), using an activation threshold uncorrected for multiple comparisons (Z > 1.96) and a cluster extent threshold of 10 voxels. The PPI analysis identified a number of clusters, all in the left hemisphere, that changed their correlation with lPMd activity after TMS, specifically: sensorimotor cortex, posterior IPS, SMA, and CMA (Figure 6; Table S3). After TMS, there was a change in correlation between activity in the stimulated region (lPMd) and activity in other areas of the left hemisphere action selection network. For illustrative purposes, the areas of activation change (blue clusters, Z > 1.96) are superimposed on the network activated during select task performanc"

Moreover, some neurons respect the territory of others of the same type, a phenomenon known as tiling. Different types of neurons, however, often have overlapping dendritic fields. We found that Down's syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) is required for dendritic self-avoidance of all four classes of Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons. However, neighboring mutant class IV da neurons still exhibited tiling, suggesting that self-avoidance and tiling differ in their recognition and repulsion mechanisms. Introducing 1 of the 38,016 Dscam isoforms to da neurons in Dscam mutants was sufficient to significantly restore self-avoidance. Remarkably, expression of a common Dscam isoform in da neurons of different classes prevented their dendrites from sharing the same territory, suggesting that coexistence of dendritic fields of different neuronal classes requires divergent expression of Dscam isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1984579609,"Alternative splicing of the Drosophila gene Dscam results in up to 38,016 different receptor isoforms proposed to interact by isoform-specific homophilic binding. We report that Dscam controls cell-intrinsic aspects of dendrite guidance in all four classes of dendrite arborization (da) neurons. Loss of Dscam in single neurons causes a strong increase in self-crossing. Restriction of dendritic fields of neighboring class III neurons appeared intact in mutant neurons, suggesting that dendritic self-avoidance, but not heteroneuronal tiling, may depend on Dscam. Overexpression of the same Dscam isoforms in two da neurons with overlapping dendritic fields forced a spatial segregation of the two fields, supporting the model that dendritic branches of da neurons use isoform-specific homophilic interactions to ensure minimal overlap. Homophilic binding of the highly diverse extracellular domains of Dscam may therefore limit the use of the same “core” repulsion mechanism to cell-intrinsic interactions without interfering with heteroneuronal interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1968504051,"The initial electron transfer dynamics during photosynthesis have been studied in Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centers from wild type and 14 mutants in which the driving force and the kinetics of charge separation vary over a broad range. Surprisingly, the protein relaxation kinetics, as measured by tryptophan absorbance changes, are invariant in these mutants. By applying a reaction-diffusion model, we can fit the complex electron transfer kinetics of each mutant quantitatively, varying only the driving force. These results indicate that initial photosynthetic charge separation is limited by protein dynamics rather than by a static electron transfer barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2071439887,"Interactions between microtubules and the cell cortex play a critical role in positioning organelles in a variety of biological contexts. Here we used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to study how cortex-microtubule interactions position the mitotic spindle in response to polarity cues. Imaging EBP-2::GFP and YFP::alpha-tubulin revealed that microtubules shrink soon after cortical contact, from which we propose that cortical adaptors mediate microtubule depolymerization energy into pulling forces. We also observe association of dynamic microtubules to form astral fibers that persist, despite the catastrophe events of individual microtubules. Computer simulations show that these effects, which are crucially determined by microtubule dynamics, can explain anaphase spindle oscillations and posterior displacement in 3D."

Thus, we hypothesized that mechanisms might exist to prevent overt inflammatory responses during physiological fluctuations in nutrients or under nutrient-rich conditions, and we identified the six-transmembrane protein STAMP2 as a critical modulator of this integrated response system of inflammation and metabolism in adipocytes. Lack of STAMP2 in adipocytes results in aberrant inflammatory responses to both nutrients and acute inflammatory stimuli. Similarly, in whole animals, visceral adipose tissue of STAMP2(-/-) mice exhibits overt inflammation, and these mice develop spontaneous metabolic disease on a regular diet, manifesting insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, mild hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease. We conclude that STAMP2 participates in integrating inflammatory and metabolic responses and thus plays a key role in systemic metabolic homeostasis."

We find that Spinophilin, a Protein-phosphatase 1 (PP1) targeting protein, is responsible for the dephosphorylation of the MAP Doublecortin (Dcx) Ser 297 selectively at the “wrist” of growing axons, leading to activation. Loss of activity at the “wrist” is evident as an impaired microtubule cytoskeleton along the shaft.

Eukaryotic RecQ helicases are known to associate with numerous genome maintenance proteins that modulate their cellular functions, but there is little information regarding protein complexes involving the prototypical bacterial RecQ proteins. Here we use an affinity purification scheme to identify three heterologous proteins that associate with Escherichia coli RecQ: SSB (single-stranded DNA-binding protein), exonuclease I, and RecJ exonuclease. The RecQ-SSB interaction is direct and is mediated by the RecQ winged helix subdomain and the C terminus of SSB. Interaction with SSB has important functional consequences for RecQ. SSB stimulates RecQ-mediated DNA unwinding, whereas deletion of the C-terminal RecQ-binding site from SSB produces a variant that blocks RecQ DNA binding and unwinding activities, suggesting that RecQ recognizes both the SSB C terminus and DNA in SSB·DNA nucleoprotein complexes.

Activation of the RecF pathway in E. coli for DSB repair requires mutation of the sbcB gene (encoding Exonuclease I (ExoI), a 3′-5′ ssDNA nuclease) (10Kushner S.R. Nagaishi H. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl.

In addition to its roles in the RecF pathway, E. coli RecQ cellular activities include the suppression of illegitimate recombination (22Hanada K. Ukita T. Kohno Y. Saito K. Kato J. Ikeda H. Proc.

Although E. coli RecQ is involved in several activities that must be coordinated with other proteins, the molecular basis underlying this coordination is presently unclear. Eukaryotic RecQ proteins form extensive protein interaction networks that help regulate their biochemical activities (1Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem.

For example, human WRN protein has been found to interact with over a dozen different DNA replication, recombination, and repair proteins (3Lee J.W. Harrigan J. Opresko P.L. Bohr V.A. Mech.

Some of these interactions are conserved with other RecQ proteins (e.g. replication protein A (RPA), the eukaryotic SSB, binds human WRN (30Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)), whereas others appear to be specific for individual RecQ paralogs. Most eukaryotic RecQ proteins are significantly larger than the prototypical E. coli RecQ, with extensive sequences N- or C-terminal to the conserved domains that define the RecQ family. Mapping studies have indicated that heterologous proteins can bind to these N- and C-terminal extensions and/or to the RecQ core region (1Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.W. Harrigan J. Opresko P.L. Bohr V.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For example, RPA binds WRN through both a high affinity site located in the N-terminal extension of WRN and a lower affinity site in its winged helix (WH) subdomain; the structure of the latter WH domain is conserved in E. coli RecQ (31Doherty K.M.

Despite the relative simplicity and well defined biochemical activities of bacterial RecQ helicases, much less is known about bacterial RecQ protein interactions than for RecQ proteins from eukaryotic systems. To identify RecQ binding partners in E. coli, we used a tandem affinity purification (TAP; Ref. 37Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M.

Three proteins co-purified with TAP-RecQ: SSB, RecJ, and ExoI. We show that purified RecQ and SSB interact directly with one another to form a stoichiometric complex of modest stability. Previous studies have shown that SSB or SSB·DNA complexes can interact with ExoI (38Sandigursky M. Mendez F. Bases R.E. Matsumoto T. Franklin W.A. Radiat Res. 1996; 145: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Genschel J. Curth U. Urbanke C. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or RecJ (40Han E.S. Cooper D.L. Persky N.S. Sutera Jr., V.A. Whitaker R.D. Montello M.L. Lovett S.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), respectively, consistent with the RecQ-ExoI and RecQ-RecJ interactions occurring by their simultaneous binding to a common SSB homotetramer. Consistent with its role as a binding site for other proteins, we find that the highly conserved C terminus of SSB functions as its RecQ-binding site. Additionally, the RecQ WH subdomain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with SSB, indicating that E. coli RecQ uses a surprisingly similar mode of interaction with SSB to that used in the human WRN-RPA complex (31Doherty K.M. Sommers J.A. Gray M.D. Lee J.W. von Kobbe C. Thoma N.H. Kureekattil R.P. Kenny M.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol.

E. coli SSB stimulates RecQ DNA unwinding reactions, whereas eukaryotic and bacteriophage SSB proteins (Saccharomyces cerevisiae RPA and T4 gp32) block RecQ DNA unwinding. Moreover, deletion of the RecQ-binding site from E. coli SSB produces a variant that strongly inhibits RecQ-mediated DNA binding and unwinding. These results establish SSB as an important feature that helps define RecQ substrates. Identification of the RecQ-SSB interaction furthermore helps explain coordination of RecQ activity with other genome maintenance enzymes through SSB-mediated complexes. Oligonucleotides o30 (5′-CTAATGACGGTCCTAGACGAACCGAGCGTC-3′) and o100 (5′-GACGCTCGGTTCGTCTAGGACCGTCATTAGTATGTTGATATACATAGACCTTACCGCAGTGATTCGCTTGTCAGTCCATTGAAGCACAATTACCCACGC-3′) were synthesized and purified by Integrated DNA Technologies. 3′ overhang DNA substrate was made as follows: o30 was phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP, annealed to o100, resolved by 12% native PAGE, and isolated by electroelution. The DNA substrate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. Peptides wt (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-Asp-Asp-Asp-Ile-Pro-Phe), ssb113 (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-Asp-Asp-Asp-Ile-Ser-Phe), and mixed (Trp-Asp-Phe-Met-Asp-Asp-Pro-Phe-Ile-Asp) were synthesized and purified by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. The Trp residue at the N terminus of each peptide was added for quantitation. pTAP-RecQ encodes the E. coli RecQ protein with a C-terminal TAP tag. pTAP-RecQ was generated by subcloning two PCR-generated DNA fragments from E. coli K12 genomic DNA into pBS1539 (37Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T.

The first fragment included the 200 base pairs upstream of the start codon and the entire E. coli recQ open reading frame, which was subcloned for in-frame expression of RecQ with the TAP tag encoded in pBS1539. The second fragment included the 200 base pairs that follow the E. coli recQ stop codon, which was subcloned downstream of the stop codon of the TAP cassette. The pTAP-RecQ promoter, open reading frame, and terminator were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the plasmid. Genomic sequence encoding E. coli K12 RecQ residues 1-407 (RecQΔC202, which contains the RecQ catalytic core domain but lacks the WH subdomain) or 408-523 (RecQ WH subdomain) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pET28b, creating pET28-RecQΔC202 or pET28-RecQ-WH, respectively. These constructs include sequences coding for an N-terminal hexahistidine purification tag fused to each RecQ fragment. The fidelity of the coding regions was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Similar overexpression vectors encoding full-length E. coli RecQ (residues 1-609), its catalytic core (residues 1-523), and HRDC domain (residues 524-609) have been described previously (41Bernstein D.A.

An 8-liter culture was grown to an A600 nm of ∼0.8, harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 40 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (6 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 4mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 4 mg/liter leupeptin, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 19.5 mg/liter benzamidine, 8.7 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40 substitute) with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science), and lysed by French press. Soluble lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with IgG-Sepharose beads (pre-equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40); the beads were then washed with 3 volumes of equilibration buffer. TEV cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 15 μl of 15 μm TEV protease was incubated with the lysate/bead mixture with shaking for 1.5 h at 16 °C. The eluent was incubated with 300 μl of calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) and 3 μl of 1 m calcium chloride in calmodulin binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h with shaking. Resin was washed with calmodulin binding buffer, and TAP-RecQ was eluted using EGTA elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm EGTA). Eluted protein was then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (25% w/v) on ice for 30 min, pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold acetone, and suspended in 200-μl gel buffer components. After SDS-PAGE, individual bands or interband regions were excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for identification of peptides (University of Wisconsin Mass Spectrometry Facility). Recombinant RecQ Fragment Purification—Purification schemes for full-length E. coli RecQ, the RecQ catalytic core domain, and RecQ HRDC domain have been described previously (41Bernstein D.A.

BL21 DE3 cells transformed with pLysS (Novagen) and either pET28-RecQΔC202 or pET28-RecQ-WH were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells at an A600 nm of ∼0.7 were induced to overexpress protein with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for an additional 2.5 h of growth and were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm glucose) and lysed by sonication on ice. Soluble lysate was loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and washed with lysis buffer until protein was undetectable in the eluent. Protein was eluted by the addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol. The eluent was dialyzed against lysis buffer with 1 mm EDTA. The protein solution was diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol until the concentration of NaCl was ∼50 mm, further purified by ion exchange on a Q-Fastflow column (GE Healthcare), concentrated, and passed over a Sephacryl S-300 column. Fractions containing pure protein were concentrated to ∼1-5 g/liter and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol. All of the protein concentrations were determined by measuring their A280 in 6.0 m guanidine HCl (44Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). SSB, SSBΔC8, RPA, T4 gp32—Plasmids for overexpressing E. coli SSB and SSBΔC8 were gifts from Michael Cox and were purified as in Lohman et al. (45Lohman T.M. Green J.M. Beyer R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae RPA was a gift from Michael Cox. T4 gp32 was purchased from New England Biolabs. Co-precipitation experiments were performed essentially as described earlier (39Genschel J. Curth U. Urbanke C. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli RecQ or a RecQ variant (20 μm monomers) was incubated with E. coli SSB or SSBΔC8 (20 μm tetramers) in 20-μl reactions in co-precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) on ice for 15 min. The reactions were adjusted to 150 g/liter ammonium sulfate (final reaction volume, 30 μl), incubated on ice for an additional 15 min, and then centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 RPM. Supernatant was removed, and pellets were washed three times with 50 μl of co-precipitation buffer plus 150 g/liter ammonium sulfate. Pellet fractions were suspended in 45 μl of Laemmli loading buffer (43Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A1-A20Google Scholar). 15 μl of Laemmli loading buffer were added to supernatant fractions. 9 μl of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4-15% or 8-16% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Experiments were carried out using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter with VPViewer software employed for instrument control and data collection (MicroCal). RecQ (10 μm), RecQ-WH (20 μm), and SSB (200 μm) were dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol prior to binding experiments. Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in the dialysis buffer used above. RecQ or RecQ-WH was thermostatted at 25 °C in a stirred (300 rpm) sample cell (1.4 ml), and the titrations were carried out as follows: 1) for RecQ with SSB or peptide titrants, 1 injection (1 μl for 2 s), 8 injections (4 μl for 8 s each), and then 21 injections (8 μl for 16 s each) were measured with 130-s equilibration between injections; 2) for RecQ-WH with wt peptide titrant, 1 injection (1 μl for 2 s), 8 injections (4 μl for 8 s each), and then 21 injections (8 μl for 16 s each) were measured with 130-s equilibration between injections; and 3) for RecQ-WH with ssb113 or mixed peptide titrants, 1 injection (1 μl for 2 s), 18 injections (4 μl for 8 s each), and then 21 injections (8 μl for 16 s each) were measured with 130-s equilibration between injections. The calorimetric data were processed using the MicroCal ORIGIN software package, and binding isotherms were fit by a nonlinear iterative least squares algorithm to a model containing a single set of independent sites. Binding parameters were determined from the fits. Twenty nm SSB or SSBΔC8 (tetramers), RPA (trimer), or gp32 was incubated with ∼1nm 3′ overhang substrate at room temperature in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 5.5% (v/v) glycerol. RecQ was added to initiate the unwinding reaction at indicated concentrations and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding 9.6 μg of proteinase K, 0.25% SDS, 30 mm EDTA, 0.75 ng of unlabeled o30 and incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. The products were resolved by 12% native PAGE, dried, and imaged using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 phosphorimager. Two nm SSB or SSBΔC8 (tetramers) or the appropriate buffer control was incubated with ∼1nm 3′ overhang substrate at room temperature in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 5.5% (v/v) glycerol with 0-500 nm of E. coli RecQ. The products were resolved by 10% native PAGE, dried, and imaged using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 phosphorimager. TAP-RecQ Co-purifies with SSB, RecJ, and ExoI—TAP allows efficient isolation of protein complexes through two purification steps that take advantage of protein A and calmodulin peptide binding moieties attached to a target protein. We used the TAP process to identify candidate RecQ binding partners in E. coli K12 strain MG1655. TAP-RecQ was expressed from a multicopy plasmid (pTAP-RecQ) into which the recQ promoter and open reading frame (46Irino N. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were fused in frame with a sequence encoding a C-terminal TAP tag. The recQ gene terminator (200 base pairs) was subcloned downstream of the sequence encoding the TAP tag to mimic recQ transcriptional regulatory elements on the plasmid. After transformation of pTAP-RecQ into MG1655, growth of the strain in rich medium and purification as described in under “Experimental Procedures,” the TAP eluent was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie staining revealed the presence of eight discrete bands with regions of light staining inter-spersed between several of the bands (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Gel mobility of the bands compared with a molecular mass standard indicated that their masses were between ∼20 and ∼70 kDa, with the slowest migrating band corresponding to the predicted mass of 73 kDa for TAP-RecQ. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of trypsin-derived peptides was used to identify the protein(s) in each band. This analysis showed that the seven slowest migrating bands were RecQ or RecQ fragments that were presumably generated through proteolysis of the full-length protein (Fig. 1B). The faster migrating RecQ bands were generally enriched for more C-terminal elements of the RecQ protein (consistent with the C-terminal attachment for the TAP tag), and all appeared to have the central RecQ C-terminal domain intact. Some of the RecQ bands in Fig. 1A appear to be mixtures of different breakdown products rather than a single species. For example, band 6 has an es"

A metric of roadless space is needed for monitoring the balance between these ecological costs and societal benefits. We introduce a metric, roadless volume (RV), which is derived from the calculated distance to the nearest road. RV is useful and integrable over scales ranging from local to national. The 2.1 million cubic kilometers of RV in the conterminous United States are distributed with extreme inhomogeneity among its counties."
https://openalex.org/W3023623776,"Ultracold neutral plasmas occupy an exotic regime of plasma physics in which electrons form a swarming, neutralizing background for ions that sluggishly move in a correlated manner. Strong interactions between the charged particles give rise to surprising dynamics such as oscillations of the average kinetic energy during equilibration and extremely fast recombination. Such phenomena offer stimulating and challenging problems for computational scientists, and the physics can be applied to other environments, such as the interior of gas giant planets and plasmas created by short-pulse laser irradiation of solid, liquid, and cluster targets."
https://openalex.org/W2011956567,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) function is regulated in the extracellular space by many modulator proteins, including those containing a von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain. The function of the VWC domain-containing proteins in development and diseases has been extensively studied. The structural basis, however, for the mechanism by which BMP is regulated by these proteins is still poorly understood. By analyzing chordin, CHL2 (chordin-like 2), and CV2 (crossveinless 2) as well as their individual VWC domains, we show that the VWC domain is a versatile binding module that in its multiple forms and environments can expose a variety of binding specificities. Three of four, two of three, and one of five VWCs from chordin, CHL2, and CV2, respectively, can bind BMPs. Using an array of BMP-2 mutant proteins, it can be demonstrated that the binding-competent VWC domains all use a specific subset of BMP-2 binding determinants that overlap with the binding site for the type II receptors (knuckle epitope) or for the type I receptors (wrist epitope). This explains the competition between modulator proteins and receptors for BMP binding and therefore the inhibition of BMP signaling. A subset of VWC domains from CHL2 binds to the Tsg (twisted gastrulation) protein similar to chordin. A stable ternary complex consisting of BMP-2, CHL2, and Tsg can be formed, thus making CHL2 a more efficient BMP-2 inhibitor. The VWCs of CV2, however, do not interact with Tsg. The present results show that chordin, CHL2, and CV2 regulate BMP-2 signaling by different recognition mechanisms. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) function is regulated in the extracellular space by many modulator proteins, including those containing a von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain. The function of the VWC domain-containing proteins in development and diseases has been extensively studied. The structural basis, however, for the mechanism by which BMP is regulated by these proteins is still poorly understood. By analyzing chordin, CHL2 (chordin-like 2), and CV2 (crossveinless 2) as well as their individual VWC domains, we show that the VWC domain is a versatile binding module that in its multiple forms and environments can expose a variety of binding specificities. Three of four, two of three, and one of five VWCs from chordin, CHL2, and CV2, respectively, can bind BMPs. Using an array of BMP-2 mutant proteins, it can be demonstrated that the binding-competent VWC domains all use a specific subset of BMP-2 binding determinants that overlap with the binding site for the type II receptors (knuckle epitope) or for the type I receptors (wrist epitope). This explains the competition between modulator proteins and receptors for BMP binding and therefore the inhibition of BMP signaling. A subset of VWC domains from CHL2 binds to the Tsg (twisted gastrulation) protein similar to chordin. A stable ternary complex consisting of BMP-2, CHL2, and Tsg can be formed, thus making CHL2 a more efficient BMP-2 inhibitor. The VWCs of CV2, however, do not interact with Tsg. The present results show that chordin, CHL2, and CV2 regulate BMP-2 signaling by different recognition mechanisms. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; GDF, growth and differentiation factor; BMPR, bone morphogenetic protein receptor; ActA, activin A; ActR, activin receptor; ECD, extracellular domain, ectodomain; VWC, von Willebrand factor type C domain; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; RU, resonance units. 2The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; GDF, growth and differentiation factor; BMPR, bone morphogenetic protein receptor; ActA, activin A; ActR, activin receptor; ECD, extracellular domain, ectodomain; VWC, von Willebrand factor type C domain; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; RU, resonance units. are secreted growth factors of the TGF-β superfamily, which play important roles during embryonic development in pattern formation and tissue specification (1Hogan B.L. Harvey Lect. 1996; 92: 83-98PubMed Google Scholar). In adult tissues, BMPs are essential for tissue repair and homeostasis (2Reddi A.H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 249-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Tobin J.F. Celeste A.J. Drug. Discov. Today. 2006; 11: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The effects of dimeric BMP depend on binding to and signaling through a receptor complex consisting of two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptor chains. The type II chains transactivate the type I chains, which transduce the signal to nucleus through Smad proteins (4Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 5Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 6Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). BMPs and other TGF-β like proteins have two kinds of epitopes for receptor binding. The so-called “wrist” epitope comprises residues from both monomers and binds type I receptor ectodomains (ECD). The “knuckle” epitope is constituted by one monomer only and binds type II receptor ectodomains (7Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Both epitopes are promiscuous, and each of them can functionally interact with several different receptor chains. Furthermore, the epitopes can have low or high affinities, depending on the ligand and the receptor chain. For instance, the BMP-2 wrist epitope binds with high affinity the type I receptors BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB, whereas at the BMP-2 knuckle epitope, type II receptors BMPR-II, ActR-II, and ActR-IIB are bound with low affinity. Remarkably, the same ActR-II and ActR-IIB receptors interact at high affinity with the corresponding epitope of activin A (ActA), whereas ActR-IB is the low affinity chain specifically for ActA (9Sebald W. Nickel J. Zhang J.L. Mueller T.D. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The residues of BMP-2 determining affinity and specificity for type I and type II receptor binding have been identified by submitting a large array of BMP-2 mutants to Biacore interaction analysis with receptor ectodomains. The binding interface of the wrist epitope for the most part is hydrophobic (7Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Of 10 hydrogen bonds occurring in the BMP-2-BMPR-IAecd contact, only two in the center contribute to affinity. A BMP-2 L51P mutant, which has lost one of the central hydrogen bonds due to the introduced proline, lacks high affinity binding to BMPR-IA but has retained wild type affinity for BMP modulator proteins, like noggin and gremlin (10Keller S. Nickel J. Zhang J.L. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The binding interface of the BMP-2 knuckle epitope is also hydrophobic. A central hydrogen bond with type II receptors ActR-II and ActR-IIB can be disrupted in the BMP-2 S88A mutant with a minor effect on binding affinity (11Weber D. Kotzsch A. Nickel J. Harth S. Seher A. Mueller U. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This central hydrogen bond is highly conserved and exists also in the ActA-ActR-IIB contact. In the activin receptor, this hydrogen bond determines high affinity binding (12Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Remarkably, some BMP-2 mutants at the border of the knuckle epitope (L100K and L100K/N102D) exhibit strongly increased affinity specifically for ActR-IIB (11Weber D. Kotzsch A. Nickel J. Harth S. Seher A. Mueller U. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast, other mutations (e.g. BMP-2 A34D) disrupt binding of type II receptors, resulting in antagonistic variants (8Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The BMP signaling is subject to stringent regulation at multiple levels (13Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular cofactors, such as inhibitory Smads and Smurfs, act as modulators. At the cell surface, pseudoreceptors like BAMBI can attenuate BMP signaling. Finally, a large number of modulator proteins exist in the extracellular space, which inhibit and/or enhance the receptor-mediated activity of BMPs. These proteins include noggin, follistatin, members of the Dan family proteins, and chordin-like proteins, which contain a von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain. The three-dimensional structure of the noggin·BMP-7 complex provides a paradigm for the mechanism of BMP inhibition by a secreted antagonist. Noggin binds as a dimer with very high affinity to the dimeric BMP-7, occluding all four binding sites of the BMP for the type I and type II receptors (14Groppe J. Greenwald J. Wiater E. Rodriguez-Leon J. Economides A.N. Kwiatkowski W. Affolter M. Vale W.W. Belmonte J.C. Choe S. Nature. 2002; 420: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, for the interaction of BMPs and noggin, the functional epitope(s) (i.e. the residues determining binding affinity and specificity) are still poorly understood. In follistatin-activin complex, two follistatin monomers surround the dimeric ligand and bury the binding sites for type I and type II receptors (15Thompson T.B. Lerch T.F. Cook R.W. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Harrington A.E. Morris-Triggs S.A. Ruotolo B.T. Robinson C.V. Ohnuma S. Hyvonen M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis revealed that only residues at the type II receptor-binding surface of activin are critical for high affinity follistatin binding, and the interaction surfaces of activin for type II receptors and follistatin are overlapping but not identical (17Harrison C.A. Chan K.L. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2744-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dissection of the follistatin domain structure revealed that the unique N-terminal Fs0 domain, which as a pseudo-type I receptor contacts the wrist epitope of activin, appears to be dispensable for activin interaction (16Harrington A.E. Morris-Triggs S.A. Ruotolo B.T. Robinson C.V. Ohnuma S. Hyvonen M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Noggin, chordin, follistatin, and Dan family proteins have different specificities and affinities for different BMPs (13Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, different binding epitopes are likely to exist on the BMPs. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of these proteins, it is necessary to know how these binding epitopes are constructed, how they overlap with the receptor-binding wrist and knuckle epitopes, and whether inhibitors could be generated that are specific for each type. In this study, we concentrated on the VWC domain-containing proteins chordin, CHL2 (chordin-like 2), and CV2 (crossveinless 2). In addition, Tsg (twisted gastrulation), which does not contain the VWC domain but participates in the regulation of BMP functions by chordin-like proteins (Fig. 1A), was also analyzed. The VWC domain, also called the cysteine-rich domain, typically contains less than 100 residues and has in common the conserved CXXCXC and CCXXC consensuses. Otherwise, the sequences of the VWC domain are highly diverse. The VWC exists in about 500 extracellular proteins from Drosophila to human (82 proteins in Homo sapiens and 85 proteins in Mus musculus). Many VWC-containing proteins act as extracellular modulators in the BMP/TGF-β signaling pathway (18Garcia Abreu J. Coffinier C. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. De Robertis E.M. Gene (Amst). 2002; 287: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The proteins chordin, CHL2, CV2, and Tsg function via the direct binding to BMPs and play important roles in development and diseases (20De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Sattari P. Tang T. Boyle B. Funk W. Rupp F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Chordin and Tsg regulate the dorsoventral patterning in early embryogenesis (20De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). CV2 plays essential pro-BMP roles in mouse organogenesis (26Ikeya M. Kawada M. Kiyonari H. Sasai N. Nakao K. Furuta Y. Sasai Y. Development. 2006; 133: 4463-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). CHL2 is expressed preferentially in chondrocytes of developing cartilage and osteoarthritic joint cartilage and may play negative roles in the (re)generation and maturation of articular chondrocytes in the hyaline cartilage of both developing and degenerated joints (21Nakayama N. Han C.Y. Cam L. Lee J.I. Pretorius J. Fisher S. Rosenfeld R. Scully S. Nishinakamura R. Duryea D. Van G. Bolon B. Yokota T. Zhang K. Development. 2004; 131: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Studies showed that chordin and CHL2 inhibit BMP signaling (20De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 21Nakayama N. Han C.Y. Cam L. Lee J.I. Pretorius J. Fisher S. Rosenfeld R. Scully S. Nishinakamura R. Duryea D. Van G. Bolon B. Yokota T. Zhang K. Development. 2004; 131: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Tsg and CV2 are BMP-modulating proteins for which both anti- and pro-BMP activities were reported (22Oelgeschlager M. Larrain J. Geissert D. De Robertis E.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Wills A. Harland R.M. Khokha M.K. Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Rentzsch F. Zhang J. Kramer C. Sebald W. Hammerschmidt M. Development. 2006; 133: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Tsg forms a ternary complex with chordin and BMP, making chordin a better BMP inhibitor. On the other hand, Tsg facilitates the cleavage and inactivation of chordin by zinc-metalloproteinases of the Tld (Tolloid)/Xld (Xolloid) family. In this context, Tsg behaves as a pro-BMP factor (27Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. Zakin L. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2001; 128: 4439-4447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Drosophila, a model has been suggested in which chordin homologue Sog (short gastrulation) and Tsg act to transport BMPs (Dpp/Scw) to the dorsal midline of the embryo. The diffusion of BMPs in the embryo in this way establishes a graded BMP activity (28Eldar A. Dorfman R. Weiss D. Ashe H. Shilo B.Z. Barkai N. Nature. 2002; 419: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 29Shimmi O. Umulis D. Othmer H. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 2005; 120: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The BMP/Tsg/chordin/Xolloid system has been recognized to be more complex than we understood. Several chordin-like proteins have been identified (18Garcia Abreu J. Coffinier C. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. De Robertis E.M. Gene (Amst). 2002; 287: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), Tsg activity independent of chordin and BMP binding has been found (30Xie J. Fisher S. Development. 2005; 132: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Oelgeschlager M. Reversade B. Larrain J. Little S. Mullins M.C. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2003; 130: 4047-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, the sizzled protein has been found to inhibit Xolloid enzyme activity and thereby enhances chordin function (32Lee H.X. Ambrosio A.L. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 2006; 124: 147-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast to the extensive studies on the functions of chordin/Tsg and other modulator proteins in development and diseases, the structural basis for the mechanisms of BMP regulation by these proteins remains uncertain. We show in this study that the BMP-2 binding epitopes for chordin and CV2 are mainly overlapping with the knuckle epitope of BMP-2, CHL2 binds to both the wrist and knuckle epitopes of BMP-2, and Tsg binds only to the wrist epitope of BMP-2 for type I receptor. The three VWC domain-containing proteins chordin, CHL2, and CV2 regulate BMP-2 signaling via different recognition mechanisms. Furthermore, their binding to BMP-2 differs from the binding mode established for noggin/BMP7 or follistatin/activin interaction. Protein Expression and Purification—All of the modulator proteins and VWC domains were expressed with a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS) plus a His6 tag in SF9 insect cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (PharMingen). The full-length proteins included mouse chordin (amino acids 1-922), CHL2 (amino acids 1-401), and Tsg (amino acids 1-198) and zebrafish CV2 (amino acids 1-651). The VWC domains of chordin were expressed with 20 amino acids in the N- and C-terminal flanking regions (before the first and after the last cysteine, respectively; see supplemental Fig. 1). CHL2 VWC domains were expressed as follows: 7-VWC1-15, 15-VWC2-20, and 20-VWC3-16 (the numbers indicate numbers of residues in flanking sequences; see supplemental Fig. 1). Chordin-VWC1 and CHL2-VWC3 were also expressed with 5 residues in flanking sequences (supplemental Fig. 1). To determine the specificity of chordin domains for BMPs, constructs containing chordin VWC1 plus the large segment between VWC1 and VWC2 (VWC1-P) and VWC2, -3, and -4 (VWC2-3-4; Fig. 1A) were also generated. The zebrafish CV2-VWC domains are spaced very closely to each other and were therefore expressed as follows: 16-VWC1-2, 2-VWC2-2, 2-VWC3-13, 13-VWC4-11, and 11-VWC5-6. Later, a construct consisting of CV2 VWC2-3-4-5 (CV2-VWC2-5) was also expressed. The proteins were isolated from the culture medium of infected SF9 cells by standard procedures involving Ni2+/nitriloacetate/agarose (Qiagen), directly purified or digested with thrombin (Sigma), and then purified by TMAE (Merck) or SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange chromatography, BMP-2 affinity column (for proteins with BMP-2 binding activity), and gel filtration chromatography through a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) to apparent homogeneity. BMP-2, GDF-5, and BMP receptor ectodomains (with His6 tag) were expressed as described (8Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Weber D. Kotzsch A. Nickel J. Harth S. Seher A. Mueller U. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). BMP-7 was purchased from R&D. Biosensor Interaction Analysis—The binding of BMPs/modulators was recorded on a BIAcore 2000 system (Amersham Biosciences Biosensor) as described (8Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Keller S. Nickel J. Zhang J.L. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For dissociation constants (KD) of <50 nm, kinetic constants (kon and koff) were evaluated. For KD values of >50 nm, dose-dependent equilibrium binding was evaluated. KD values or rate constants koff/kon were evaluated from one experiment determined for 6-9 different concentrations of the analytes. Mean values of KD and their S.D. values were calculated from the values of at least three different experiments. S.D. values for the obtained affinities were less than 50%. For the comparison of the BMP-2 wild type and mutants, differences between mean values of more than 2 times S.D. were considered significant. Co-immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (21Nakayama N. Han C.Y. Cam L. Lee J.I. Pretorius J. Fisher S. Rosenfeld R. Scully S. Nishinakamura R. Duryea D. Van G. Bolon B. Yokota T. Zhang K. Development. 2004; 131: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the modulator proteins containing His6 tag were incubated with BMP-2 in 1 ml of binding buffer, followed by 2-5 μg/ml anti-His tag antibody (Invitrogen). The complex precipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and BMP-2 was detected with anti-BMP-2 monoclonal antibody (R&D). As the controls, the modulator proteins were detected by anti-His tag antibody in parallel. To demonstrate the inhibitory effects of the modulator proteins on BMP-2 binding to the receptors, BMPR-IA and ActR-IIB ectodomains containing His6 tag were bound to BMP-2 and competed with modulator proteins, where the His6 tag has been cleaved off by thrombin (see above). The complex was co-precipitated by protein A-Sepharose. Gel Filtration Chromatography and SDS-PAGE—The experiments were performed as described previously (34Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) except that β-galactosidase (130 kDa) was used additionally to calibrate the Superdex 200 column, and the equation log Mr =-2.5524 × Kav + 5.6528 was used to calculate the apparent molecular weight. To avoid insolubility, BMP-2 was diluted to 0.1 mg/ml, and the injected sample value was 500 μl. Biological Activity in Cell Lines—Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined in serum-starved C2C12 cells as described (8Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Keller S. Nickel J. Zhang J.L. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Inhibition of BMP-2-induced ALP activity by modulators was assessed by incubating C2C12 cells with different concentrations of modulators plus 10 nm BMP-2. Relief of CHL2, CV2, and Tsg inhibition of BMP-2-induced ALP activity was assessed by incubating C2C12 cells with 10 nm BMP-2 plus 50 nm CHL2 or CV2 or 500 nm Tsg and increasing concentrations (10-40 nm for CHL2, 6.3-25 nm for CV2, and 31-250 nm for Tsg) of BMP-2 mutants. Results are given as mean values from six determinations done in parallel for each condition. Binding Affinities and Specificities of BMPs for Modulator Proteins—The binding affinities of chordin for various BMPs and GDFs have been described before (20De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 33Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Now we compared the binding of chordin, CV2, CHL2, and Tsg to representatives of three subfamilies of BMPs (i.e. BMP-2, BMP-7, and GDF-5) by biosensor-based interaction analysis. The KD values of BMPs/GDF to immobilized modulator proteins were in the nanomolar level (Fig. 1B). BMP-2 bound to CV2 and CHL2 with high affinities, which are similar to those of BMP-2 for its high affinity type I receptor (8Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). BMP-7 bound to chordin and CV2 with similar affinity as BMP-2, but it bound to CHL2 with about 20 times lower affinity than BMP-2. GDF-5, a more distantly related member of the BMP subfamily, bound to the three VWC domain-containing proteins with lower affinities than BMP-2 and BMP-7, but binding affinity to Tsg was comparable with those of BMP-2 and BMP-7. The discriminating affinities demonstrate that binding specificity exists in ligands of the BMP/GDF subgroup and the analyzed modulator proteins. Binding Affinities and Specificities of BMPs for VWC Domains—The interactions of BMP-2 with the VWC domains in the modulator proteins were analyzed by Biacore and further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). As shown before (33Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chordin VWC domains VWC1 and VWC3 were found to bind to BMP-2 (Fig. 1, B and C). Surprisingly, however, BMP-7 bound to immobilized VWC1 with an affinity about 5 times higher than that of BMP-2 to VWC1. It bound to VWC3 very weakly but bound to VWC4 with 100-fold higher affinity (23 nm) than that of BMP-2 to VWC4 (Fig. 1B). The binding of BMP-2 to VWC4 could not be visualized in co-immunoprecipitation, probably due to the low affinity (Fig. 1, B and C; see also below, the affinity of VWC4 to immobilized BMP-2). GDF-5 bound to VWC1 with relatively lower affinity (180 nm) and to VWC3 with very low affinity (∼1 μm, Fig. 1B), leading to the weaker binding of GDF-5 to whole chordin (220 nm). No binding was found between chordin VWC2 and BMP-2/-7 and GDF-5 (Fig. 1C) (data not shown). These results suggest that BMP-2 preferentially binds to VWC1 and VWC3 of chordin, BMP-7 does so to VWC1 and VWC4, and GDF-5 binds weakly to VWC1 and VWC3. We found comparable binding affinities of BMPs when VWC domains of chordin were expressed with flanking regions of different sizes (i.e. VWC1 or VWC1-P, VWC3 or VWC2-3-4, VWC4 or VWC2-3-4 (Fig. 1B), and VWC1 with 5 or 20 residues in the flanking region (data not shown)). These results indicate that the binding epitopes are located within the VWC domains, and the connecting peptide between VWC1 and VWC2 and the other adjacent non-VWC sequences do not contribute to the binding affinities and specificities of chordin VWC domains to BMPs. CHL2 and CV2 contain three and five VWC domains, respectively (Fig. 1A). We found that CHL2-VWC1 and CHL2-VWC3 bound to BMP-2, BMP-7, and GDF-5, but VWC2 of CHL2 did not (Fig. 1, B and C) (data not shown). Similar to the chordin-VWC1s of different sizes, the CHL2-VWC3s with 5 or 20 amino acids in the flanking region showed also the same affinity for BMPs/GDF (data not shown). VWC1 and VWC3 of CHL2 bound to BMP-2 separately with about 100 and 20 times lower affinity compared with full-length CHL2. This indicates that the affinity of CHL2 to BMP-2 is the sum of the cooperative binding of two VWC domains. Interestingly, VWC1 and VWC3 of CHL2 bound to BMP-7 with affinity similar to or slightly weaker than that of full-length CHL2. In contrast, in the full-length CHL2, VWC1 seems to account for most of the binding affinity for GDF-5. The binding of CV2 to BMP-2/-7 and GDF-5 occurs via its N-terminal segment containing VWC1-5 (24Rentzsch F. Zhang J. Kramer C. Sebald W. Hammerschmidt M. Development. 2006; 133: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but which of the individual domains was involved was not known. To our surprise, now we found that the VWC1 domain of CV2 was the only one of the five existing VWC domains that bound to BMPs (Fig. 1, B and C). CV2-VWC1 bound to BMP-2/-7 and GDF-5 with affinities similar to those of full-length CV2 (Fig. 1B) (24Rentzsch F. Zhang J. Kramer C. Sebald W. Hammerschmidt M. Development. 2006; 133: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The VWC domains 2, 3, 4, and 5 and the fragment VWC2-5 had no binding affinity for these ligands (data not shown and Fig. 1C). This indicates that the binding occurs only via CV2-VWC1. The Binding Epitopes of BMP-2 for Chordin, CV2, CHL2, and Tsg—Next, we used an array of BMP-2 mutants to delimit its binding epitopes for the modulator proteins. According to the structure of the ternary complex of BMP-2·BMPR-IA·ActR-IIB (11Weber D. Kotzsch A. Nickel J. Harth S. Seher A. Mueller U. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. BMC Struct.

https://openalex.org/W2074002348,"Blogs are one of the latest tools that scientists use to communicate their ideas to other scientists or to the general public. But who are the science bloggers and why do they blog? Blogs are one of the latest tools that scientists use to communicate their ideas to other scientists or to the general public. But who are the science bloggers and why do they blog? There are close to 50 million weblogs or blogs for short. Blogs provide an online discussion forum for issues of current interest and are updated regularly with new short articles on which readers can comment. The Pew Internet and American Life Project (http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP%20Bloggers%20Report%20July%2019%202006.pdf), an initiative of the Pew Research Center, reports that 8% of Internet users in the United States, or 12 million American adults, keep a blog and 39% read one. Most bloggers (37%) write about their life and experiences; politics is a distant second with 11% of bloggers; and technology, including science, comes in at 4%. According to the Technorati blog search engine (http://www.technorati.com), there are about 19,881 blogs with a “science” tag. Most of these are “pseudoscience blogs, new age blogs, creationist blogs, or computer technology blogs,” says Bora Zivkovic, a Ph.D. student who writes A Blog Around the Clock (http://scienceblogs.com/clock). Zivkovic estimates that the actual number of science blogs is 1,000 to 1,200 and notes that such blogs are “written by graduate students, postdocs and young faculty, a few by undergraduates and tenured faculty, several by science teachers, and just a few by professional journalists.” These 1,000 or so science blogs provide authoritative opinions about pressing issues in science, such as evolution or climate change, or aim to engage other scientists in open and frank discussions about the scientific literature or science policy. Because of their freewheeling nature, these blogs take scientific communication to a different level. The rock star of scientist bloggers is Paul Myers, an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota, who writes Pharyngula (http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula). With about 20,000 visitors per day, Pharyngula is currently the most popular science blog according to Technorati. Myers started writing about 4 years ago. “It was a casual decision. One summer I had some free time and started typing away. And people started coming to the site,” he recalls. “I thought that I would stop in a month or so but I didn't. I find it useful for communicating with other scientists and the community.” Myers not only writes about his brand of science, developmental biology, but often discusses politics and religion. “The blog would not be as popular if it was only about science,” he says. “I am popularizing science using political issues as a hook.” An expert opinion, a wide range of topics, and a distinct personality are qualities that readers seem to value in a blog. Derek Lowe was an insider of the pharmaceutical industry when he started blogging in 2002. He jotted down notes of his daily thoughts without disclosing any information about his own work or those of colleagues. “When I started I was definitely the only one blogging from inside the drug industry. I thought others would soon join but it has not happened,” he says. Lowe is mindful of the fact that his blog In the Pipeline (http://www.corante.com/pipeline/) enjoys a broad readership, from chemists, to investors, to the lay public. “I cannot just geek out and have heavy chemistry posts one after the other, or just heavy pharmaceutical industry information. I don't want to baffle or frustrate those who are not experts,” he explains. Instead, In the Pipeline provides a variety of topics for people to discuss online, such as how to get a certain chemical reaction to work, or how the market might react to a new cancer therapy, or even, how to land a new job. Some scientists first entered the blogosphere by blogging about evolution—a topic that, like climate change, has galvanized public opinion. Tara Smith, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Iowa, got into blogging by writing for Panda's Thumb (www.pandasthumb.com), one of the first science blogs by observers and critics of the creationist movement. “I got some good comments and I started thinking I had more stories to tell than I could really share so I decided to start my own blog.” She now writes Aetiology (http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology), a popular blog that focuses on topics within Smith's research field, infectious diseases, but also discusses evolution, science education, and, on occasion, parenting. Meanwhile, John Timmer, a research associate at the University of California, contributes to the blog Nobel Intent (http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars) published by Ars Technica, an online magazine of human arts and sciences. “When I was following the Dover trial, it was very clear to me that intelligent design is not science, but other people were seeing the same testimony and coming to a different conclusion,” says Timmer. “I realized there are large portions of the public who don't get science.” Motivated by a desire to help change the situation, Timmer offered to contribute to Nobel Intent. Since 2005, he has been spending about an hour a day, usually at lunchtime, to scan the scientific literature and come up with topics to write about. The concept of scientists reaching out to a lay audience is not new. “Scientists are an opinionated bunch and they have given their thoughts on discoveries or events by speaking with journalists, writing letters to journals, authoring commentaries,” says Matthew C. Nisbet, a professor in the School of Communication at American University in Washington DC. “Blogs provide a lot more of that commentary, but delivered almost instantaneously.” According to Nisbet, blogs written by scientists provide an authoritative opinion on a topic, often within a richer context than, for example, a news article. “Science blogs are important because they continue to engage the attentive public in scientific topics,” he says. Nisbet—whose blog Framing Science (http://scienceblogs.com/framing-science) focuses on the intersections between science, media, and politics—believes blogs are an important communication tool for the scientific community. “In the digital age, information is found based on availability rather than accuracy. If different interest groups start blogs that attack peer-reviewed science, and the scientific community does not engage in similar communication mode, they will miss an important opportunity to educate the public,” he says. In a recent article (Science 316, 56, 2007), Nisbet and colleague Chris Mooney, a correspondent for the popular science magazine Seed, wrote that “Without misrepresenting scientific information on highly contested issues, scientists must learn to actively ‘frame’ information to make it relevant to different audiences.” In other words, instead of focusing on explaining the technical details of scientific issues, scientists should define arguments in a way that resonates with the public's “core values and assumptions.” Scientist bloggers are debating the implications of this approach. Myers wrote in his blog that if he took Nisbet and Mooney's advice “I'd end up giving fluff talks that play up economic advantages and how evolution contributes to medicine… and I'd never talk about mechanisms and evidence again. That sounds like a formula for disaster to me.” As the debate about the Nisbet-Mooney article exemplifies, blogs allow discussions of scientific issues that do not typically take place in the scientific literature. “A scientific journal is not the right vehicle for debate and discussion,” says Larry Moran, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Toronto and author of the popular biochemistry textbook Principles of Biochemistry. As a case in point, Moran used his blog Sandwalk (http://sandwalk.blogspot.com) to start a debate about evolutionary developmental biology. “There's much to criticize in the field of evolutionary developmental biology or evo-devo,” leads off his March 30, 2007 entry. It continues “The thing that bugs me more than anything else is the attempt to create a general theory of evolution based entirely on a subset of living species: namely multicellular animals.” But how significant are these discussions if only a minority of scientists read blogs, or write them? “Blogs are important sources for opinion leaders, activists, and journalists. They help create a lot of the discourse out in the world,” explains Nisbet. Indeed, many discussions that grab the attention of bloggers have ended up in the pages of The New York Times or in the news sections of science journals. “Blogs are having an impact because newsmakers read them,” says Moran. “To some extent we are writing for science journalists. We are saying ‘Here is something getting the wrong kind of coverage’ or ‘Here is something you should be paying attention to.’” Moran, at age 60, is somewhat unique among bloggers. Most bloggers, regardless of what they write about, tend to be younger. According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project more than half of all bloggers in the United States are under the age of 30. “Most of my colleagues think what I do is strange. Partly, that's because they are not into the technology. I happen to have grown up with the Internet and understand its culture,” says Moran. “I think the younger people who are blogging now are likely to be doing it when they are 60.” The age barrier is not the only thing keeping more scientists from blogging. The biggest impediment is probably lack of time. According to most bloggers, posts can take 30 minutes to a couple of hours to research and compose. That may not seem like much, except that a critical factor for a blog's success is that posts are updated frequently, ideally at least once a day. “If I ever stop doing this, it is because of time commitment,” says Moran. In general, scientists who blog say the benefits outweigh the problems. Most believe they have become better communicators and have gained a broader appreciation of different scientific issues. So why aren't more scientists blogging? Even among scientists who are interested in communicating about science, many are uncomfortable with the nature of blogging itself. Speaking at the North Carolina Science Blogging Conference (http://wiki.blogtogether.org/blogtogether) held in January 2007 in Chapel Hill, Huntington Willard, director of Duke University's Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy, said that blogging is “antithetical” to how scientists—at least those of his generation—have been trained. “I am a scientist and my opinion actually does not matter a bit. It is the data that matters and my interpretation of the data,” he said to his audience. “To scientists [blogging] is a tough jump to make and yet one that hopefully an increasing number of scientists will make in order to share our educated viewpoint on some science issue and have that be one of several mechanisms we use to try to engage the public.” “Most scientists are not comfortable with blogging,” says Myers. “The training we get is to separate opinion from evidence, but blogs blur the difference.” Myers says on occasion colleagues have criticized him for “taking something objective and turning it into something personal.” Alex Palazzo's blog The Daily Transcript (http://scienceblogs.com/transcript) is a mix of musings about research and the ups and downs of postdoc life. A postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Tom Rapoport at Harvard Medical School, Palazzo suspects that 95% of his readers are other scientists, many working on RNA or in related fields. Although he always gives priority to his bench research over blogging, Palazzo says blogging helps him to think about his work more clearly. “One time I posted a question about energetics of cells and one of my readers pointed out an article published in the 1990s that turned out to be very insightful.” He also gets useful information by reading other blogs. “A lot of bloggers are bioinformatics scientists and computational biologists. Their blogs often talk about Web-based analysis tools,” says Palazzo. “I find it useful to sift through those posts to find potential resources.” Although some of his posts are very “science heavy,” Palazzo, like most scientist bloggers, does not talk about his unpublished research, or that of his colleagues. “Sometimes I will go to a talk and will be very excited about something I heard, but I hold back on writing about it,” he says. For bench scientists, such openness might cost them a publication or cause them to get scooped. But there are exceptions. Jean-Claude Bradley and his students at Drexel University are experimenting with a live open lab notebook on his blog Useful Chemistry (http://usefulchem.blogspot.com) and wiki (http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com). The blog discusses and analyzes results, with links to the raw data on the wiki. Bradley's group writes down the experimental plan, the results as raw data, observations, then conclusions—every detail a scientist would include in a lab notebook except that the information is available on the Web for everyone to see and comment on. “We don't just put things that work but also failed experiments. We thought that if we cannot use the data maybe others will find a use for them,” says Bradley. People have come to Useful Chemistry looking for the boiling point of a given compound or a chemical reaction. “It is encouraging to see that,” says Bradley. “Part of what we wanted to do was put small bits of information out there that might be useful.” He has not yet tried to publish any of the data on his blog but says he will soon be in a position to do so. He is well aware that most top-tier journals have guidelines precluding publication of anything that has already been reported, regardless of its format. There is one case (The Scientist 21, 21, 2007) where a scientist blogger ended up becoming a coauthor on a paper thanks to his blog. Back in 2005, Reed Cartwright, a Ph.D. student in genetics at the University of Georgia, wrote an alternative interpretation of published findings about the mutant hothead gene of Arabidopsis (Nature 434, 505, 2005) in his blog De Rerum Natura. Several months later, Luca Comai at the University of California, Davis was publishing a similar interpretation in the journal Plant Cell. When he found out that Cartwright had already “published” the idea in a blog, he offered to make Cartwright a coauthor on the Plant Cell paper (17, 2856, 2005). Because scientist bloggers are few in number, they risk getting lost in the vastness of the blogosphere. A few websites identify science blogs and cluster them for readers. For example, Pharyngula, Aetiology, The Daily Transcript, and Framing Science are among the 60 or so blogs on http://scienceblogs.com. This website, created by the Seed Media Group (publishers of Seed magazine), serves as a one-stop shop for science blogs written by both scientists and science communicators. Currently the site contains 32,089 posts on science topics and ten times as many comments from readers. According to the website, bloggers were selected based on their “originality, insight and talent and how they would contribute to the discussion on scienceblogs.com.” The organizer of this year's NC Science Blogging Conference, Bora Zivkovic, says the initial motivation for the conference was to “meet in person a bunch of bloggers that I talk to online.” Applications arrived from all over the world and more than 170 people attended. The next conference will be held January 19, 2008, also in Chapel Hill. This conference brings together “scientists, science bloggers, science journalists, and science educators for a day of exchanging ideas and information,” says Zivkovic. The blogosphere can be overwhelming. Efforts to cluster blogs written by experts should make it easier for scientists, and those interested in science, to find what they are looking for. Tangled Bank (http://tangledbank.net) provides a bi-weekly showcase of “good” blog writing focused on biology and evolution. Other so-called blog “carnivals” include Mendel's Garden (http://mendels-garden.blogspot.com), a monthly collection of blog posts on genetics, and Gene Genie (http://scienceroll.com/2007/02/17/gene-genie-the-first-issue), which appears every two weeks and is dedicated to covering every gene in the human genome. For the uninitiated, The Open Laboratory: The Best Writing on Science Blogs 2006, for sale at Lulu.com, is a collection of 50 of the best science blog posts of 2006. “When people hear ‘blog’ they think of a personal journal with bad grammar or a highly biased angry political post,” says Zivkovic, who put together the anthology. “People who are more comfortable with a book will see that blogs provide high quality science online.”"
https://openalex.org/W2013862100,"The adapter protein ADAP regulates T lymphocyte adhesion and activation. We present evidence for a previously unrecognized function for ADAP in regulating T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T cells with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 resulted in impaired nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed degradation and decreased phosphorylation of IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB). TCR-stimulated assembly of the CARMA1-BCL-10-MALT1 complex was substantially impaired in the absence of ADAP. We further identified a region of ADAP that is required for association with the CARMA1 adapter and NF-kappaB activation but is not required for ADAP-dependent regulation of adhesion. These findings provide new insights into ADAP function and the mechanism by which CARMA1 regulates NF-kappaB activation in T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2029712099,"We found that, in the mouse visual cortex, action potentials generated in a single layer-2/3 pyramidal (excitatory) neuron can reliably evoke large, constant-latency inhibitory postsynaptic currents in other nearby pyramidal cells. This effect is mediated by axo-axonic ionotropic glutamate receptor–mediated excitation of the nerve terminals of inhibitory interneurons, which connect to the target pyramidal cells. Therefore, individual cortical excitatory neurons can generate inhibition independently from the somatic firing of inhibitory interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2088477641,"The cytoskeletal regulators that mediate the change in the neuronal cytoskeletal machinery from one that promotes oriented motility to one that facilitates differentiation at the appropriate locations in the developing neocortex remain unknown. We found that Nck-associated protein 1 (Nap1), an adaptor protein thought to modulate actin nucleation, is selectively expressed in the developing cortical plate, where neurons terminate their migration and initiate laminar-specific differentiation. Loss of Nap1 function disrupts neuronal differentiation. Premature expression of Nap1 in migrating neurons retards migration and promotes postmigratory differentiation. Nap1 gene mutation in mice leads to neural tube and neuronal differentiation defects. Disruption of Nap1 retards the ability to localize key actin cytoskeletal regulators such as WAVE1 to the protrusive edges where they are needed to elaborate process outgrowth. Thus, Nap1 plays an essential role in facilitating neuronal cytoskeletal changes underlying the postmigratory differentiation of cortical neurons, a critical step in functional wiring of the cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2089298763,"<i>Escherichia coli</i> PriA protein plays crucial roles in processing of arrested replication forks. PriA serves as a sensor/stabilizer for an arrested replication fork and eventually promotes restart of DNA replication through assembly of a primosome. PriA carries a 3′ terminus binding pocket required for its high affinity binding to a specific arrested fork as well as for its biological functions. We show here that PriA binds to DNA in a manner either dependent on or independent of 3′ terminus recognition. The former mode of binding requires the 3′ terminus binding pocket present at the N-terminal half of the 181-residue DNA binding domain and exhibits specific bipartite interaction on the template DNA. The latter mode is independent of the pocket function, but requires the C-terminal half of the same domain. ATP hydrolysis activity of PriA can be stimulated <i>in vitro</i> by either of the two binding modes. We propose architecture of PriA bound to various arrested replication fork structures and discuss its implication in helicase activation and ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2121091904,"Two c-Jun leucine zipper variants that bind with high affinity to c-Fos have been selected using semirational design combined with protein-fragment complementation assays (JunW) or phage display selection (JunWPh1). Enriched winners differ from each other in only two of ten semi-randomized positions, with ΔTm values of 28 °C and 37 °C over wild-type. cFos-JunW, cFos-JunWPh1, and two intermediate mutants (cFos-JunWQ21R and cFos-JunWE23K) display biphasic kinetics in the folding direction, indicating the existence of a folding intermediate. The first reaction phase is fast and concentration-dependent, showing that the intermediate is readily populated and dimeric. The second phase is independent of concentration and is exponential. In contrast, in the unfolding direction, all molecules display two-state kinetics. Collectively this implies a transition state between unfolded helices and dimeric intermediate that is readily traversed in both directions. We demonstrate that the added stability of cFos-JunWPh1 relative to cFos-JunW is achieved via a combination of kinetic rate changes; cFos-JunWE23K has an increased initial dimerization rate, prior to the major transition state barrier while cFos-JunWQ21R displays a decreased unfolding rate. The former implies that improved hydrophobic burial and helix-stabilizing mutations exert their effect on the initial, rapid, monomer-collision event. In contrast, electrostatic interactions exert their effect late in the folding pathway. Although our focus is the leucine zipper region of the oncogenic transcription factor Activator Protein-1, coiled coils are ubiquitous and highly specific in their recognition of partners. Consequently, generating kinetic-based rules to predict and engineer their stability is of major significance in peptide-based drug design and nano-biotechnology.

Understanding how a specific sequence of amino acids is able to form a unique and functional three-dimensional structure has long been regarded as the last piece of the genetic jigsaw. The required search through conformational space is not a random one, as was first highlighted by Cyrus Levinthal (1Levinthanl C. De-Brunner J.T.P. Munck E. Mossbauer Spectroscopy in Biological Systems: Proceedings of a Meeting held at Allerton House, Monticello, Illinois. 1969: 22-24Google Scholar). Rather, protein chains are guided both thermodynamically and kinetically to the point of lowest free energy; usually the folded state (2Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). Much progress has been made in this field, in large by studying small monomeric proteins (3Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Mason J.M. Gibbs N. Sessions R.B. Clarke A.R.

However, studying proteins that contain quaternary structure is of great appeal and is certainly more useful in the design of peptide based drugs, presenting the possibility to engineer protein stability at the protein-protein interface in addition to elucidating the overall folding mechanism. However, studying either proteins with quaternary structure, or proteins that are large (>100 residues) leads to complications in the folding pathway; e.g. multiple transition states, intermediates, and even multiple pathways, making it extremely difficult to extract useful mechanistic information. However, a number of small dimeric proteins have been successfully studied owing to more straightforward two- or three-state folding mechanisms (8Gittelman M.S. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7011-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 9Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5282-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Milla M.E.

However, some have speculated about the existence of intermediates (22Jelesarov I. Durr E. Thomas R.M. Bosshard H.R.

The mammalian homologues of GCN4, namely c-Jun and c-Fos, dimerize to form the oncogenic transcription factor Activator Protein-1 (AP-1). 3The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein-1; CD, circular dichroism; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PCA, protein-fragment complementation assay; FU, fraction unfolded. 3The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein-1; CD, circular dichroism; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PCA, protein-fragment complementation assay; FU, fraction unfolded. This protein plays a central role in the cell signaling cascade, and is a pivotal transcription factor involved in proliferation and oncogenesis (25Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar, 26Lu C. Shen Q. DuPre E. Kim H. Hilsenbeck S. Brown P.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6516-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AP-1 therefore presents an interesting, highly relevant, and yet poorly understood model in the study of folding and binding, but also in designing new dominant negative variants with improved KD over the wild-type; the ultimate aim being to specifically inhibit oncogenic proteins in cancerous situations. A problem that emerges from studying these oligomeric proteins, however, is that folding and binding is concomitant (12Zitzewitz J.A. Bilsel O. Luo J. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12812-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Bosshard H.R. Durr E. Hitz T. Jelesarov I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and that folding is also dependent on the concentration of monomer. This in turn has implications on how the folding mechanism should be studied; some have monitored folding using tryptophan fluorescence (17Sosnick T.R. Jackson S. Wilk R.R. Englander S.W. DeGrado W.F. Proteins. 1996; 24: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), or using fluorescent dyes tagged to the termini (14Wendt H. Berger C. Baici A. Thomas R.M. Bosshard H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4097-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), while others have opted for a global measure of helicity using a stopped-flow circular dichroism technique (12Zitzewitz J.A. Bilsel O. Luo J. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12812-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This last method appears to be the more informative, since fluorescence changes in solvent exposed tryptophan residues (where fewer structural perturbations are imposed) or in terminal dyes would inform poorly on early helix formation events prior to monomer collision. This is because changes in solvation are unlikely to be large in such early folding events. Some have circumvented this problem by disulfide-bridging one monomer to another and monitoring helicity as a function of time (19Moran L.B. Schneider J.P. Kentsis A. Reddy G.A. Sosnick T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10699-10704Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Bunagan M.R. Cristian L. Degrado W.F. Gai F.

A. 2004; 101: 15639-15644Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), effectively removing both problems. However, the validity of this is questionable when extrapolating the information back to the wild-type dimeric protein, and has been speculated to attain the downhill folding limit by simply “zipping up” without a folding barrier (28Meisner W.K. Sosnick T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15639-15644Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, additional identifiable steps on the folding pathway, despite the added complexities, permit more information to be extracted regarding the level of structure and hydrophobic exposure along the folding coordinate. We previously constructed high affinity peptide variants directed at the leucine zipper regions of c-Jun and c-Fos (see Fig. 1) (29Mason J.M. Schmitz M.A. Muöller K.M. Arndt K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8989-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 4U. B. Hagemann, J. M. Mason, K. M. Muöller, and K. M. Arndt, submitted manuscript. 4U. B. Hagemann, J. M. Mason, K. M. Muöller, and K. M. Arndt, submitted manuscript. The ultimate aim of this study was to create dominant negatives that bind to either Fos or Jun with much improved stability over wild-type, and to understand how sequence defines structure. Extracting information on how key residues at crucial positions within the structure confer kinetic rules for stability would permit fast tracking the design process for future variants. We therefore explored how differences in stability for these variants are manifested. Is stability achieved at the kinetic level where dimeric proteins are able to fold faster, because of a lowering of the transition state barrier, relative to the unfolded protein? Conversely, is the stability achieved at the thermodynamic level, by raising the height of the transition state barrier relative to the folded state? Answering these questions will permit designing for improved stability protein-protein interactions, which fulfill these criteria from the outset. Peptide Purification—Peptides (cFos: ASTDTLQAETDQLEDEKYALQTEIANLLKEKEKLGAP; cJun: ASIARLEEKVKTLKAQNYELASTANMLREQVAQLGAP; JunW: ASAAELEERVKTLKAEIYELQSEANMLREQIAQLGAP; JunWQ21R: ASAAELEERVKTLKAEIYELRSEANMLREQIAQLGAP; JunWE23K: ASAAELEERVKTLKAEIYELQSKANMLREQIAQLGAP; Jun-WPh1: ASAAELEERVKTLKAEIYELRSKANMLREQIAQLGAP) were synthesized by Protein Peptide Research Ltd (Fareham, UK) and subsequently purified to >98% purity using RP-HPLC with a Jupiter Proteo Column (4-μm particle size, 90-Å pore size, 250 × 10 mm; Phenomenex) and a gradient of 5–60% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at 1.5%/min. Residue changes relative to JunW are highlighted in bold. Masses corresponding to the major peaks were assessed using in-house electrospray mass spectrometry. Peptide concentrations were determined in water by absorbance at 280 nm with an extinction of 1209 m–1 cm–1 (31Du H. Fuh R.A. Li J. Corkan A. Lindsey J.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 141-142Google Scholar) corresponding to a tyrosine residue inserted into a solvent-exposed b3 position. Equilibrium Denaturation—Circular dichroism spectra and chemical denaturation profiles were performed at 20 μm total peptide concentration in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm potassium fluoride, pH 7.0. Ultra-pure guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) was purchased from Carl Roth Chemicals GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany) and concentrated to 6 m as determined by refractometry. The CD signal at 222 nm, corresponding to the α-helical content, was allowed to equilibrate before being recorded using a 1-cm pathlength CD cell in a Jasco J810 Circular Dichroism spectrophotometer. Sequential 50-μl additions of 20 μm total peptide (in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm potassium fluoride, 6 m GuHCl, pH 7.0) were added and the CD signal recorded, following equilibration, to ensure that the protein concentration in the CD cell remained constant. All reaction solutions were maintained at 293 K using a thermostatted circulating water bath and were monitored continuously with a sensitive thermocouple. From this, the fluctuation in temperature was determined to be no more than (0.1 K). Thorough mixing of the solutions was ensured using a magnetic bar. Stopped-flow Circular Dichroism (SF-CD)—Folding measurements (Fig. 2A) were initiated by mixing a 220 μm solution of unfolded peptide containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm potassium fluoride, and 3.5 m GuHCl (pH 7.0) against 10 volumes of the given concentration of GuHCl at 293 K in a PiStar-180 (π *-180) SF-CD apparatus (Applied Photophysics Ltd) to give a postmix peptide concentration of 20 μm. In the case of the wild-type protein, cFos-cJun, a 40 μm post-mix total peptide concentration at 283 K was still not sufficient to be able to monitor folding or unfolding. For all other samples, kf1 was calculated from kapp according to Equation 12. The relationship between the first phase and protein concentration was found to be linear within the 5–20 μm range (Fig. 3A). A wavelength of 222 nm was selected using entrance and exit slit widths of 4 mm. The post-mix concentration of GuHCl was calculated according to the following: (3.5 m +(pre-mix [GuHCl] × 10))/ 11. Folding measurements were taken between 0.32 and 1.39 m post-mix GuHCl concentrations (see Fig. 4, A and B), a range in which the unfolding rate was not expected to contribute significantly. For the unfolding reactions (Fig. 2B), a 220 μm solution of folded peptide in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm potassium fluoride pH 7.0 was mixed against 10 volumes of an appropriate concentration of GuHCl at 293 K and the post-mix GuHCl concentration calculated according to the following: (pre-mix [GuHCl] × 10)/11. Unfolding measurements were taken between 2.77 and 4.28 m GuHCl (see Fig. 4C) where folding was not predicted to contribute significantly. Unfolding is unimolecular and was found to be independent of protein concentration (Fig. 3B). All concentrations of GuHCl dilutions were determined by refractometry. The resulting data points are the result of at least three kinetic transient averages.FIGURE 3The concentration dependence of A, the initial folding amplitude (kf1) and B, the unfolding rate (ku) for cJun-FosW, performed at 5, 10, and 20 μm Pt, respectively, demonstrates that while the initial folding amplitude is concentration-dependent and consistent with a second order reaction, the unfolding amplitude is consistent with a first-order reaction and is independent of concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4GuHCl dependence of the rate constants for refolding (A, kf1; B, kf2) and unfolding (C, ku1). Values for ku2 cannot be obtained with any degree of certainty because of the large error in kf2. This error results from the large differences in rate between kf1 and kf2, so that while the initial fast rate can be accurately determined, the second cannot (see B). Data for kf2 have not been used in the interpretation of results but are included here for completeness; in this case, m-values have been restrained to fall exactly halfway between m-values for t1 and t2, this range represents around 15% of the overall m-value change. Lines represent global fits to the data, with each data point being the average of at least three kinetic transients. In the case of A, kapp has been corrected for peptide concentration according to Equation 12.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Equilibrium Data Analysis—Equilibrium curves were fitted to the two state model in Equation 1, N22K2U1 where N2 is the native peptide dimer, U is the unfolded monomer, and K = [U]2/[N2]. The upper and lower baselines of the unfolding profiles were defined according to Equations 2 and 3, ub=ui+usċ[GuHCl]2 lb=li+lsċ[GuHCl]3 where ub and lb are the upper and lower baselines, ui and li the upper and lower intensities (the respective ellipticities at 0 m denaturant), and us and ls are the upper and lower slopes relating to the unfolded and folded states, respectively. The fraction unfolded can be calculated according to Equation 4, FU=θx−lbub−lb 4 to yield the fraction of protein which is unfolded at any given concentration of GuHCl, where θX, lb, and ub are the CD signals at point X, for folded protein, and unfolded protein, respectively. Once FU has been determined for any concentration of denaturant, it may be converted to KD according to Equation 5, KD=(2FU2Pt1−FU) 5 where Pt is the total protein concentration (in molar units). For the purposes of the global fitting procedure FU can described purely in terms of KD and Pt. The KD can then be converted to ΔG for each GuHCl data point according to Equation 6. FU=−KD+KD2+8KDPt4Pt6 This quadratic function is formed by combining the three equations KD = [U]2/[N2], Pt = 2[N2] + [U], and [U] = FUPt to describe FU in terms of KD and Pt only. Values for FU are calculated using Equations 2, 3, 4 (see Fig. 5A), and Equation 6 is solved to derive a value for KD. To obtain the most accurate value for the free energy of unfolding in water (ΔGF → U(W)); however, values for FU were taken from the transition zone of the denaturation profiles, converted to KD according to Equation 5, and a linear fit was carried out (Fig. 5B). This is because the signal to noise ratio is at its lowest where the change in intensity is at its greatest, and is achieved by plotting the derived ln (KD) as a function of [GuHCl]. A linear fit is used to extrapolate to the free energy of unfolding in water, ΔGF → U(W), in accordance with the linear extrapolation method (32Pace C.N. Vanderburg K.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 33Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar, 34Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4901-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) in Equation 7, ΔGU→F(W)=ΔGU→F+meqċD7 where ΔGF → U represents the free energy of unfolding at any given concentration of denaturant, and the slope meq is an approximate measure of the water accessible protein surface exposed per unit concentration of denaturant (with units cal mol–1 m–1). Thermal Data Analysis—Thermal stability was similarly assessed according to Equations 1, 2, 3, 4 and Equation 6. This can then be applied to give a global non-linear fit (shown in Fig. 5C) to derive thermal melting (Tm) values; the temperature at which the protein is 50% unfolded. The Tm values (given in the Abstract) can be derived using a global fit to Equations 2, 3, 4, and 6 and Equation 8, ΔG=ΔH(TA/Tm)×(ΔH+R×Tm×ln(Pt))+ΔCp×(TA−Tm−TA×ln(TA/Tm))8 where ΔH is the enthalpy change, TA is the reference temperature, R is the ideal gas constant, and ΔCP is the change in heat capacity. Once again to obtain the most accurate estimate of ΔGF → U(W), FU data corresponding to the transition only were taken, converted to ln(KD) according to Equation 5 and plotted against temperature (Fig. 5D) according to Equation 9, ΔGU→F(W)=mċT+C9 where m is the gradient, T is the temperature (in Kelvin) and C is the intercept. Using this fit, a free energy value for the coiled coils at the reference temperature of 293 K could be determined. Measurements for all dimers were started at –8 °C, and at this temperature the peptide solutions remained aqueous, even when left overnight. The wild-type protein is unstable and consequently the lower slope associated with the pretransition baseline has been restrained using the average of the other transitions. The restraint in this lower baseline could be varied within the range of known pretransition gradients with variation of only a few degrees centigrade in the calculated Tm. Kinetic Data Analysis—Kinetic data were fitted to the three state model in Equation 10. 2U2ku2kf1I22ku1kf2N210 In this model, I2 represents a dimeric intermediate. In the folding direction, two phases are observed, which is consistent with an intermediate state. Evidence for this intermediate is supported by the fact that the first folding constant (kf1) is bimolecular, being dependent upon the concentration of denatured peptide (Fig. 3A), which informs that the intermediate state is dimeric. In contrast the unfolding rate is not affected by differences in protein concentration (Fig. 3B), indicating a first-order process. The second folding rate (kf2) is difficult to determine because of its small size relative to kf1. It is clear that the rate constants for these two folding events differ by over five orders of magnitude and have consequently been fitted as uncoupled events according to the following time-dependent decrease in ellipticity (increase in helicity) in Equations 11 and 12, θ(t)=θ0+θ1ċ(11+(kappċt))+(θ2ċexp(−kf2ċt))11 where θ0 is the final ellipticity, θ1 is the change in ellipticity associated with the first folding transition, θ2 is the change in ellipticity associated with the second folding transition (2U = I2), kapp is the apparent rate constant for the first folding transition at a given peptide concentration, kf2 is the rate constant associated with the second folding transition, and t is time. In the unfolding direction, only one exponential model is required to fit the kinetic transients, such that the barrier between U and I2 is Equation 13. kapp=kf1ċPt 12 In this model (see Equation 10), ku1 is slow relative to ku2 because of the small size of the transition state barrier that is associated with the first transition, and consequently ku ≈ ku1. This unimolecular reaction is not influenced by the concentration of dimer prior to unfolding and is therefore independent of protein concentration (Fig. 3B). This model is supported by equilibrium data collected at 20 μm where no intermediate is detectable; taken together this indicates that the folding barrier between the unfolded state and intermediate is easily surmounted in both directions. Finally, folding data can be fitted as a function of denaturant concentration to yield the kinetic constant of folding and unfolding in 0 m denaturant (w) according to Equations 14, 15, 16, θ(t)=θ0+θ1ċ(1−exp(−kuċt))13 ln(kf1(w))=ln(kf1)+(mu−mt1)ċD14 ln(kf2(w))=ln(kf2)+(ml−mt2)ċD15 ln(ku(w))=ln(ku)+(mf−mt2)ċD16 where ln(kf1) and ln(kf2) are folding constants associated with first and second transitions accordingly, at any given denaturant concentration, and ln(ku) is the unfolding rate at any given final denaturant concentration. Values for mu, mt1, mI, mt2, and mf are m-values associated with each of the identifiable states of the folding pathway and relate to the amount of solvent exposed surface area in each of these states. A fuller explanation is given in Fig. 6. These equations are used to extrapolate the rate constant and/or free energy of the relevant transition to zero denaturant concentration. Equilibrium Unfolding—Circular dichroism spectra demonstrated all peptides to be α-helical, with characteristic minima at 208 and 222 nm. GuHCl denaturation profiles were performed at 293 K for all dimeric peptides. All demonstrate a sigmoidal lowering of the 222 nm signal indicative of dimer unfolding. The transition was completely reversible, and the helical signal could be regained upon dilution of the denaturant (data not shown). Values corresponding to the fraction of unfolded protein (FU) were obtained as described above. Those values around the transition point were converted to ΔG values and extrapolated to the y-axis (see Fig. 5B) to give the most accurate estimation of the free energy of unfolding in water (ΔG(W)). The gradient of this plot corresponds to the m-value (meq) associated with the overall unfolding transition, and reports upon the exposure of hydrophobic groups to the denaturant in the unfolded state, relative to the folded. Kinetic Studies—The kinetics of folding were unable to be fitted to a two-state bimolecular model that has been widely reported for GCN4-p1 (12Zitzewitz J.A. Bilsel O. Luo J. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R.

Rather, a biphasic fit that assumed a dimeric intermediate was necessary (Equation 13). Evidence for a dimeric intermediate comes from the fact that the first transition was found to be concentration dependent for the peptide range 5–20 μm for cJun-FosW (data not shown), and further, fitting the data to a monomeric intermediate did not achieve satisfactory residuals. Rather a three state model was proposed with a dimeric intermediate (Equation 10). For all dimers, the first of these two transitions was very fast (Table 1; approximately 106 m–1 s–1, in agreement with previously reported coiled coil folding rates (12Zitzewitz J.A. Bils"

We found that oxidant stress of cardiac myocytes activated both JNK and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and that expression of JNK inhibitory mutants accelerated multiple steps in this pathway, including the cleavage and activation of caspases-3 and -9 and DNA internucleosomal cleavage, without affecting the rate of cytochrome c release; JNK inhibition also increased caspase-3 and -9 cleavage in a cell-free system.

Formation of this complex could be triggered by addition of cytochrome c and ATP to the cell-free cytosol. JNK inhibition abrogated JNK-Apaf-1 association and accelerated the association of procaspase-9 and Apaf-1 in both intact cells and cell-free extracts. We conclude that oxidant-activated JNK associates with Apaf-1 and cytochrome c in a catalytically inactive complex.

JNK actions thus appear to be highly context-dependent, and further clarification requires a better understanding of JNK substrates and partners in the apoptotic signaling cascade. We have previously shown that inhibition of JNK accelerates oxidant-mediated apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (29Andreka P. Dougherty C. Slepak T.I. Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Dougherty C.J. Kubasiak L.A. Prentice H. Andreka P. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects and molecular targets of JNK in cardiac myocytes exposed to two distinct physiologic sources of oxidative stress, the nitric oxide donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). JNK inhibition in the presence of either stressor had no effect on cytochrome c release, but accelerated post-mitochondrial apoptotic events, including caspase-9 association with Apaf-1 and activation, both in intact myocytes and in a cell-free system. Oxidant-mediated JNK activation stimulated the formation of a JNK-Apaf-1 complex that excluded active caspase-9. This finding suggests a broad adaptive role for JNK activation in oxidant-rich environments such as the myocardium. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against caspase-9 and caspase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against Apaf-1 were obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The latter was also the source for antibodies against caspase-9, JNK (FL), JNK (F3), HA (F-7), normal rabbit and mouse IgGs. Primary Culture of Rat Neonatal Cardiomyocytes—All experiments were conducted under University of Miami Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols. Primary cultures of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were generated as previously described (38Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant Adenovirus Generation and Infection—Construction of the dominant negative JNK1 adenovirus has been previously described (31Dougherty C.J. Kubasiak L.A. Prentice H. Andreka P. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses expressing inactive JNK (JIA) and dominant negative casapase-9 were generated as described by He et al. (40He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding a dominant negative mutant of rat caspase-9 (C327A) was the gift of Dr. James M. Angelastro (41Angelastro J.M. Moon N.Y. Liu D.X. Yang A.S. Greene L.A. Franke T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12190-12200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The caspase-9 mutant gene was excised with KpnI and XbaI and inserted into the kanamycin-resistant pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector (Microbix Biosystems Inc., Ontario, Canada). The plasmid encoding inactive JNK protein, a fusion between JNKK2 and JNK1 (APY) was the kind gift of Dr. Anning Lin (42Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All viral vectors were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Infection with adenoviral vectors was performed overnight at 5 multiplicity of infection and cells were incubated for a further 48 h. Infection efficiency and recombinant protein expression were monitored by GFP expression. Cell Fractionation and in Vitro Caspase Cleavage Analysis—Cell fractionation analysis was performed as described, with few modifications (43Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in cell fractionation buffer (CFB, pH 7.2): 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and proteinase inhibitors. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, homogenized using 25 strokes of a pellet pestle, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (cytosolic fraction) were reserved, and the pellets were resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 100 °C to yield the mitochondrial fraction. Protein was quantitated using the BCA method (Pierce). For caspase cleavage analysis, cytosolic lysates (100 μg) in a final volume of 40 μl per reaction were incubated with or without cytochrome c (10 μm) and ATP (2 mm) at 37 °C for 3 h. Reactions were stopped by adding 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Proteins (100–200 μg) were incubated with 20 μl of Protein A Fast Flow Sepharose containing normal IgG for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 s and supernatants were collected and incubated with appropriate primary antibody (1:50 dilution or 1.2 μg/reaction) for 2 h at 4°C with rotating. Protein A Fast Flow Sepharose (20 μl) was added into the mixtures and incubated overnight. The lysates were centrifuged, after which the supernatants were collected as the unbound fraction. The pellets were washed and boiled in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min. The mixtures were centrifuged and the whole supernatants were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblot analysis using standard methods (39Ing D.J. Zang J. Dzau V.J. Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration—Neonatal rat heart ventricles were homogenized in cell fractionation buffer, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants (cytosolic lysates) were collected and measured for protein concentration. Approximately 2.5 mg of cytosolic lysates (∼4 mg/ml) were incubated with or without cytochrome c (10 μm) and ATP (2 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Lysates were loaded into 75/16 Sepharose S300 HR gel filtration columns pre-equilibrated with cell fractionation buffer, and eluted by gravity at a flow rate of ∼0.3 ml/min. Fractions were collected at an interval of 7 min each, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for immunoblot analysis. In Vitro Caspase Activity Determination—In vitro colorimetric assays of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity were performed using a commercially available kit (Caspase-9 or Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assays, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer. Lysates were mixed with chromophore-conjugated caspase-9- or caspase-3-specific substrates (LEHD-p-nitroaniline or DEVD-p-nitroaniline, respectively) in 96-well plates, incubated for 1 h at 37°C and assayed by measuring the emission wavelength for p-nitroaniline at 405 nm. Caspase activity for each sample was normalized to protein content. Lysates from cells treated with staurosporine (1 μm) for 8 h were used as a positive control. Statistical Analysis—Results were subjected to analysis of variance to determine significant inter-group differences, followed by Student's t test (InStat, GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA). A p value of less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. Dominant Negative JNK Blocks H2O2-induced JNK Activation—Consistent with earlier reports (26Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 27Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), H2O2 induced transient activation of Jun kinases 1 and 2 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. A direct relationship between JNK activation and H2O2 concentration was observed up to 200 μm (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of both JNK-1 and JNK-2 was detectable at 15 min, maximal between 1 and 2 h, and back to baseline by 4 h (Fig. 1B). Infection of cardiomyocytes with a dominant negative JNK adenovirus almost eliminated JNK activation by H2O2 without affecting the activation level of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) or p38 (Fig. 1C and data not shown) and also blocked JNK activation by a maximally effective concentration of GSNO (Ref. 29Andreka P. Dougherty C. Slepak T.I. Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar and data not shown). A second inhibitory JNK mutant (JIA) (42Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)), a fusion of JNKK2 and the inactive JNK1 (APY) mutant, did not block H2O2-stimulated JNK phosphorylation in neonatal cardiomyocytes, but did block the phosphorylation of c-Jun (not shown), suggesting that the JIA mutant competes with endogenous JNK for occupancy of downstream targets. JNK activation induced by H2O2 could also be blocked by the anthrapyrazolone SP600125 (2 μm), a reversible ATP-competitive inhibitor of JNK with an in vivo IC50 of ∼5 μm and at least 10-fold in vivo selectivity for JNK compared with ERK or p38 (Fig. 1D) (44Krumenacker J.S.

Jun Kinase Delays Oxidant-induced Caspase-9 Activation—We have previously shown that nitric oxide donors induce time- and dose-dependent cardiac myocyte apoptosis through oxidant mechanisms, and that inhibition of Jun kinase accelerates the rate of GSNO-induced DNA fragmentation (29Andreka P. Dougherty C. Slepak T.I. Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 39Ing D.J. Zang J. Dzau V.J. Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we found that NO specifically activated the mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway. GSNO (1 mm) induced caspase-9 activation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A) without affecting caspase-8 activity (Fig. 2B) or cleavage of its substrate, Bid (not shown). Inhibition of JNK by Ad-dnJNK accelerated the onset of LEHDase activity by 4–5 h, and increased LEHDase activity over GFP-infected cells at all time points between 0 and 3 h for GSNO (Fig. 2A) and 0 and 8 h for H2O2 (Fig. 2C). Ad-dnJNK accelerated a corresponding rise in DEVDase activity, indicating activation of the caspase-9 substrate caspase-3 (Fig. 2D), whereas also enhancing H2O2-mediated caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 2, E and F), DNA internucleosomal cleavage (Fig. 2G), and apoptotic nuclear condensation (Fig. 2H). Similar results were observed in cells infected with adenovirus expressing the inactive JNK (Ad-JIA) in which JNK inhibition by Ad-JIA accelerated LEHDase and DEVDase activity induced by H2O2 (data not shown). These results show that oxidant-induced JNK activation delays activation of caspases-3 and -9, and subsequent apoptosis, by two different sources of oxidant stress. Because nitric oxide and H2O2 activate both overlapping and distinct intracellular signal pathways, this finding is consistent with JNK exerting cytoprotective effects at a common downstream effector of cell death. NO-induced Cytochrome c Release Is Independent of JNK Activity—The selective activation of caspase-9 implicates the type II, mitochondria-mediated pathway in oxidant-mediated cardiomyocyte death. Under oxidant stress, mitochondria release cytochrome c, an essential cofactor for the formation of the apoptosome and subsequent activation of caspase-9 (43Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar, 47Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar); JNK activation has been implicated in cytochrome c release from mouse embryo fibroblast mitochondria (23Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar), and from isolated cardiac mitochondria (11Aoki H. Kang P.M. Hampe J. Yoshimura K. Noma T. Matzuzaki M. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10244-10250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of JNK activation on cytochrome c release in intact cardiac myocytes, we monitored cytosolic levels of cytochrome c release in cells treated with GSNO in the presence and absence of dnJNK. In uninfected cardiac myocytes, GSNO (1 mm) induced the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol within 10 min of treatment; by 5 h after treatment, cytosolic cytochrome c levels approached those of control cells (Fig. 3). The disappearance of cytochrome c from cytosolic fractions at these time points most likely reflects loss of apoptotic cells from the culture dish; however, it is also possible that cytochrome c is taken back up by the mitochondria or otherwise eliminated in surviving cells, as proposed elsewhere (48Von Ahsen O. Waterhouse N.J. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Identical amounts and timing of cytochrome c release were seen in cells infected either with a blank virus (GFP) or Ad-dnJNK. In contrast, overexpression of Bcl-XL delayed cytochrome c release by 12 h (Fig. 3). These results show that active JNK is not required for initiation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in intact cardiac myocytes, and imply that JNK modulates caspase-9 activation through a post-mitochondrial mechanism. Jun Kinase Prevents Caspase Activation in a Cell-free System—Human caspase-9 contains phosphorylation sites for ERK and Akt (49Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S. Magee G. Pathak S. Clarke P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 50Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar), which may also be activated during oxidant stress. To avoid these potentially confounding effects, we examined the effects of JNK activity on caspase-9 and caspase-3 processing in the absence of oxidant stress, using a previously characterized cell- and organelle-free system (43Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts of cardiac myocytes and HEK293 cells expressing Ad-GFP or Ad-dnJNK were incubated with or without cytochrome c and ATP, and cleavage of caspase-3 and -9 was monitored by Western analysis. After 3 h of incubation with cytochrome c and ATP, the p37 and p20 cleavage products of caspases-9 and -3, respectively, were significantly more abundant in cardiac myocyte cytosol lacking basal JNK activity (Figs. 4, A–C). However, in HEK293 cytosolic lysates, JNK inhibition had no effect on the processing of either caspase-3 or the caspase-3 substrate inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (Fig. 4, D–F). This finding confirms that active JNK interferes with cytosolic caspase-9 activation at a step distal to the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Furthermore, this effect appears to be cell type-restricted. JNK Activation Retards Apoptosome Formation—The critical step in activation of procaspase-9 is not proteolytic processing but dimerization, potentiated by enforced aggregation within the apoptosome (12Srinivasula S.M.

Accordingly, we assessed the effect of JNK inhibition on the association of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 in cells under oxidant stress. Complex formation between caspase-9 and Apaf-1 was first detectable 3 h after GSNO stress in uninfected cells or cells expressing a blank vector (Fig. 5). In JNK-inhibited cells, caspase-9-Apaf-1 interaction appeared at least 2 h earlier, i.e. within 1 h after GSNO treatment. This difference corresponds closely to the 2–3-h acceleration in caspase-9 induction observed with JNK inhibition (compare Fig. 2, A and B), and suggests that activation of JNK by oxidant stress may create a several-hour delay in the formation of an active apoptosome. JNK Activation and Cytochrome"
https://openalex.org/W2039867462,"The aim of this research was to validate transcription magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) for gene transcript targeting in acute neurological disorders in live subjects. We delivered three MR probe variants with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION, a T2 susceptibility agent) linked to a phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotide (sODN) complementary to c-fos mRNA (SPION-cfos) or beta-actin mRNA (SPION-beta-actin) and to sODN with random sequence (SPION-Ran). Each probe (1 microg Fe in 2 microl) was delivered via intracerebroventricular infusion to the left cerebral ventricle of male C57Black6 mice. We demonstrated SPION retention, measured as decreased T2* signal or increased R2* value (R2* = 1/T2*). Animals that received the SPION-beta-actin probe exhibited the highest R2* values, followed (in descending order) by SPION-cfos and SPION-Ran. SPION-cfos retention was localized in brain regions where SPION-cfos was present and where hybrids of SPION-cfos and its target c-fos mRNA were detected by in situ reverse transcription PCR. In animals that experienced cerebral ischemia, SPION-cfos retention was significantly increased in locations where c-fos mRNA increased in response to the ischemic insult; these elevations were not observed for SPION-beta-actin and SPION-Ran. This study should enable MR detection of mRNA alteration in disease models of the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1993222493,"The subunit GluR2 of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) features a single amino acid at the narrow constriction of the pore loop that is altered from glutamine to arginine by RNA editing. This so-called Q/R site has been shown to play an important role in the determination of the electrophysiological properties of AMPA receptor complexes as well as of trafficking to the plasma membrane. The protein stargazin has also been shown to modulate electrophysiological properties and trafficking to the plasma membrane of AMPA receptors. In this study we examined via a series of mutants of the Q/R site of the AMPA receptor GluR1 whether the amino acid at this position has any influence on the modulatory effects mediated by stargazin. To this end, we analyzed current responses of Q/R site mutants upon application of glutamate and kainate and determined the amount of mutant receptor protein in the plasma membrane in Xenopus oocytes. Desensitization kinetics of several mutants were analyzed in HEK293 cells. We found that the stargazin-mediated decrease in receptor desensitization, the slowing of desensitization kinetics, and the kainate efficacy were all dependent on the amino acid at the Q/R site, whereas the stargazin-mediated increase in trafficking toward the plasma membrane remained independent of this amino acid. We propose that the Q/R site modulates the interaction of stargazin with the transmembrane domains of AMPA receptors via an allosteric mechanism and that this modulation leads to the observed differences in the electrophysiological properties of the receptor.

The majority of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system is mediated by AMPA 4The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate; AMPAR, AMPA receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; KA, kainate; CTZ, cyclothiazide; NASP, naphtylspermine; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GluR, glutamate receptor; PSD, postsynaptic density. receptors (AMPARs). These receptors assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) either as homo- or as heterotetramers (1Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) of the subunits GluR1 through GluR4. mRNA coding for GluR2 undergoes a posttranscriptional modification termed “editing” that alters a codon for a glutamine residue (Q) in the pore region into a codon for arginine (R). This position is called the Q/R editing site, or Q/R site (2Sommer B. Koehler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The editing state of GluR2 and the subunit composition determine the electrophysiological properties of AMPA receptor complexes such as desensitization, Ca2+ permeability, and current-voltage relationship (2Sommer B.

Receptor complex assembly is believed to take place via a two-step mechanism in which interaction of the N-terminal domains leads to the formation of dimers followed by the assembly of such dimers into tetramers (6Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This tetramerization is dependent on the amino acid at the Q/R site (7Greger I.H. Khatri L. Kong X. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2003; 40: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In synapses, AMPARs were shown to anchor themselves by binding to several PDZ domain-containing proteins such as GRIP, PICK-1, or SAP-97 (8Leonard M. Horne M. Garner C. Hell J. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The insertion and removal (cycling) of AMPARs in the PSD is mediated by several proteins in an activity-dependent manner (11Lüscher C. Xia H. Beattie E. Carroll R. von Zastrow M. Malenka R. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). One of these regulatory proteins is stargazin, which is disrupted in the stargazer mouse and was originally characterized as a homologue of the γ1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels (12Letts V. Felix R. Biddlecome G. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C. Valenzuela A. Bartlett F. Mori Y. Campbell K. Frankel W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The stargazer mouse lacks AMPAR-mediated responses in cerebellar granule cells, which can be rescued by overexpression of stargazin (13Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R. Wenthold R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Stargazin (γ2) belongs to the family of transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs), which include the additional members γ3, γ4, and γ8. These proteins are also able to rescue the AMPAR-mediated response to glutamate application in cerebellar granule cells of the stargazer mouse and show a distinct expression pattern in the brain (13Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R. Wenthold R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Stargazin has been demonstrated to support receptor trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane (14Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and to stabilize AMPARs in the PSD by interaction with PSD-95 and n-PIST (15Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7491-7502Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stargazin has been shown to modulate the electrophysiological properties of AMPARs by slowing down and decreasing desensitization, slowing down deactivation, decreasing the EC50 values for glutamate and kainate, increasing the probability of reaching the maximum conductance level, and increasing the mean burst length of the channel as well as the kainate efficacy (14Tomita S.

Here, we examined whether the stargazin-mediated increase in AMPAR surface expression as well as changes in the electrophysiological properties of the receptors are dependent on the amino acid at the Q/R site. We found that the extent and kinetics of receptor desensitization as well as the increase in kainate efficacy in the presence of stargazin are strongly dependent on the amino acid at the Q/R site. By contrast, the stargazin-mediated increases in surface expression appear to be entirely independent of the amino acid at the Q/R site, suggesting multiple functionally independent interactions between stargazin and AMPA receptors. Generation of Construct—Oligonucleotides were designed as degenerated mutagenesis PCR primers based on the sequence of GluR1(Q)flop (GenBank™ accession number X17184) to achieve saturating mutagenesis at the Q/R site of GluR1 in a single PCR, which was followed by subcloning. To check for successfully introduced mutations, a NarI restriction site was added as a silent mutation upstream of the codon for the Q/R site. Degenerated sense (5′-GGCGCCTTCATGDNTC-AAGGATGTGACATTTC-3′) and antisense primers (5′-GTCACATCCTTGANHCA-TGAAGGCGCCCAGGGAGA-3′, with D = (G/A/T), n = (A/C/G/T), H = (A/T/C)) were combined with antisense (5′-GGAGCCCGGGATCCCGA-3′) and sense oligonucleotides (5′-CACTCTGATCATGCCT-TCCTCT-3′), respectively, following an “overlap extension” protocol. The resulting 729-bp PCR product was subcloned into GluR1(Q)flop/pSGEM using two BglII restriction sites flanking the mutated PCR-generated sequence. The randomly generated codon at the Q/R site of a large number of clones was determined via sequencing to obtain all 19 mutants. The combination of the Q/R site mutants with the L479Y mutant was achieved by subcloning a BglII-flanked 410-bp fragment that included the mutated Q/R site into GluR1(Q)L479Yflop/pSGEM. For expression in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, the flop isoforms of GluR1(Q), GluR1(S), and GluR1(T) were subcloned into pcDNA3 using the unique EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. Stargazin was N-terminally tagged with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) by deletion of its stop codon by PCR and cloning of a PCR amplimer of its complete coding region into pECFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the unique SacI and SalI restriction sites. Heterologous Expression—Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and injected with cRNA as described previously (19Schmidt C. Werner M. Hollmann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes expressing only the receptor were injected with 4 ng of cRNA coding for the receptor. In the case of coexpression of the receptor with stargazin, 0.08 ng of cRNA coding for stargazin was injected simultaneously. HEK293 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium Eagle, Joklik modification (JMEM, Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 8% CO2. For transfection, medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were transfected with cDNA coding for GluR1(Q), GluR1(S), or GluR1(T), and either ECFP-tagged stargazin or ECFP (3:2 ratio), using the calcium phosphate method. Transfection was performed for 16 h at 37 °C and 3% CO2. After transfection the medium was changed back to JMEM. Labeling of Cell Surface Proteins Using Biotinylated ConA—Total membrane preparations and labeling of cell surface proteins with biotinylated concanavalin A were performed as described elsewhere (20Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Villmann C. Strutz N. Morth T. Hollmann M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, 4–6 days after cRNA injection, 25 oocytes were incubated in 10 μm biotinylated concanavalin A (Sigma) in normal frog Ringer's solution (NFR, containing in mm: 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2) at room temperature for 30 min. After three washes with NFR, intact oocytes were homogenized by several passages through a 100-μl pipette tip in ice-cold homogenization buffer (H-buffer: 20 μl/oocyte, containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100 plus a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete™ tablets, Roche Applied Science)). Homogenates were incubated at 4 °C on a rotator for 1 h. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min, supernatants were carefully collected, supplemented with 50 μl of H-buffer-equilibrated streptavidin-agarose beads (Fluka, Taufkirchen, Germany), and incubated for 2 h at 4 °Cona rotator. Beads were precipitated, washed 5–6 times with ice-cold H-buffer, and finally boiled for 10 min in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.8 m β-mercaptoethanol, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue) to release the precipitated receptor protein. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (22Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) (Miniprotean III, Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked for at least 2 h in 1× Rotiblock solution (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 140 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and probed overnight with affinity-purified rabbit antisera directed against the C termini of GluR1. The GluR1 antibody was a kind gift of Richard Huganir (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. All incubations were performed in 0.1× Rotiblock, 0.05% Tween 20, 140 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). Electrophysiology—Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes were performed 4–6 days after injection of the cRNA at a holding potential of –70 mV using a TurboTec 10 CX amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany). Currents were sampled at 50 Hz followed by low-pass filtering at 20 Hz. Data were digitized at 200 Hz using an ITC16 computer interface (Instrutech Corp., Long Island, NY) as A/D converter and analyzed with Pulse 8.67 (Heka, Lambrecht, Germany). Recordings were performed in Ringer's solution containing Mg2+ instead of Ca2+ to avoid the opening of Ca2+-activated chloride channels (Mg-Ringer: 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2). Receptor agonists glutamate (300 μm) and kainate (150 μm) were prepared in Mg-Ringer and applied for 20 s. Cyclothiazide (100 μm) and naphtylspermine (10 μm) were prepared in Mg-Ringer containing glutamate (300 μm) or kainate (150 μm), respectively. Amplitudes were measured as steady-state currents after 20 s of agonist application. Electrodes were filled with 3 mm KCl and showed resistances of 0.3–1 megohms. cRNA was injected in at least two independent oocyte preparations always using the same cRNA preparation. cRNAs encoding for mutants that did not show robust currents even upon coexpression with stargazin were prepared again to rule out problems with RNA quality. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of HEK293 cells were performed 24–48 h after transfection at room temperature (21–24 °C) using an EPC-9 amplifier (Heka). Currents were digitized with a sampling rate of 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2.9 kHz. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 2–10 megohms. The extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH. The pipette solution contained 130 mm CsF, 33 mm KOH, 4 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. Glutamate (1 mm) was prepared in an extracellular solution and applied for 200 ms. Rapid application of glutamate was performed using a two-channel θ glass capillary mounted on a piezoelectric translator. One channel contained continuously flowing extracellular solution, and the other contained the agonist. The patched cells were positioned in front of the channel containing the extracellular solution, and the digital/analog output of the computer was used to trigger the displacement and return of the piezoelectric translator moving the cell in front of the agonist-containing channel of the θ tube and back. Time constants of desensitization were calculated by single exponential fits with PulseFit 8.7 (Heka). Stargazin Selectively Increases the Current Responses of Distinct Q/R Site Mutants of GluR1—Stargazin has been shown to modulate the trafficking and the electrophysiological properties of AMPA receptors (14Tomita S.

As it is known that Q/R editing site of AMPA receptors is an important determinant of receptor complex assembly, trafficking, (7Greger I.H. Khatri L. Kong X. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2003; 40: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and several electrophysiological properties (2Sommer B. Koehler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H.

Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Science. 1991; 252: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), we examined whether and how different amino acids at the Q/R site influence the modulatory effects of stargazin on the AMPA receptor complex. Therefore, we mutated the Q/R site of GluR1 (“flop” isoform) to produce variants coding for each of the 20 standard amino acids and expressed these mutants in X. laevis oocytes. Responses to the application of glutamate and kainate were analyzed. All mutants showed agonist-evoked current responses much smaller (below 10 nA) than the wild type GluR1(Q), except for the mutant GluR1(N), which gave robust kainate-evoked responses (Fig. 1). These low currents could be because of low plasma membrane expression or specific electrophysiological properties of the mutants. Interestingly, the only mutant showing robust current responses for at least one of the agonists was the mutant that carried an asparagine, the amino acid that occurs in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors at the position corresponding to the Q/R site. To study the influence of the amino acid at the Q/R site on the interaction of the AMPAR with stargazing, we performed coexpression experiments with receptor mutants and stargazin. Upon coexpression of stargazin, with the exception of GluR1(V), GluR1(L), GluR1(M), GluR1(P), GluR1(H), GluR1(E), and GluR1(K), current responses were increased, either with both glutamate and kainate as the agonist or with only kainate (GluR1(A), GluR1(W), and GluR1(R); Fig. 1 and Table 1) as compared with GluR1(Q) in the absence of stargazin. The wild type GluR1(Q) and the mutants GluR1(N), GluR1(D), GluR1(C), and GluR1(Y) showed particularly strongly potentiated glutamate- and/or kainate-evoked current responses (potentiation factors >10) (Fig. 2; Table 1).TABLE 1Normalized current responses of GluR1 wild type and GluR1 Q/R site mutantsGluR1(X)GluR1(X)GluR1(X) + stgPotentiation factorsIGluIKAIGluIKAIGluIKAGln1.0 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.03.79 ± 0.9917.78 ± 2.48Asn0.22 ± 0.110.86 ± 0.3217.36 ± 2.872.41 ± 0.23216.3 ± 55.6103.7 ± 18.46Val0.08 ± 0.030.04 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.000.18 ± 0.100.22 ± 0.04Leu0.31 ± 0.150.02 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.000.14 ± 0.030.28 ± 0.08Ile0.06 ± 0.050.02 ± 0.010.25 ± 0.100.24 ± 0.072.32 ± 1.169.19 ± 3.88Ala0.04 ± 0.030.02 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.040.04 ± 0.010.75 ± 0.252.16 ± 0.58Met0.01 ± 0.010.02 ± 0.010.21 ± 0.130.02 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.030.31 ± 0.10Pro0.13 ± 0.060.20 ± 0.110.26 ± 0.090.01 ± 0.000.21 ± 0.090.04 ± 0.01Gly0.34 ± 0.080.07 ± 0.020.36 ± 0.090.20 ± 0.043.92 ± 1.478.43 ± 2.40Ser0.08 ± 0.040.03 ± 0.013.29 ± 0.631.64 ± 0.163.29 ± 0.631.64 ± 0.16Thr0.10 ± 0.040.03 ± 0.010.62 ± 0.180.43 ± 0.081.70 ± 0.608.07 ± 1.21Cys0.22 ± 0.080.22 ± 0.081.93 ± 0.411.82 ± 0.1519.13 ± 7.5790.77 ± 18.33His0.08 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.020.25 ± 0.05Trp0.22 ± 0.080.01 ± 0.010.02 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.020.13 ± 0.073.06 ± 1.06Tyr0.15 ± 0.070.02 ± 0.003.99 ± 0.750.57 ± 0.0716.17 ± 2.9311.97 ± 1.47Phe0.07 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.010.80 ± 0.170.12 ± 0.041.24 ± 0.533.65 ± 1.71Glu0.32 ± 0.060.07 ± 0.030.20 ± 0.070.04 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.441.01 ± 0.40Asp0.22 ± 0.050.03 ± 0.011.44 ± 0.430.67 ± 0.0613.22 ± 2.5639.67 ± 3.74Arg0.06 ± 0.030.02 ± 0.0030.30 ± 0.120.12 ± 0.021.14 ± 0.393.15 ± 0.41Lys0.15 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.020.002 ± 0.0010.11 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.003 Open table in a new tab The large increases in current responses upon coexpression with stargazin could theoretically be caused by two distinctly different mechanisms. First, stargazin may selectively increase the trafficking to the plasma membrane of certain mutants; or second, stargazin could modulate the electrophysiological properties of the mutants. Both effects may depend on the amino acid at the Q/R site. Stargazin Increases the Plasma Membrane Expression of the Receptor Mutants Only Slightly and in a Q/R Site-independent Manner—To examine whether the electrophysiological results obtained in the absence and presence of stargazin simply reflect the amount of receptor protein in the plasma membrane, we performed Western blot analyses of the plasma membrane expression of several representative mutants. The coexpression of stargazin and GluR1(Q) led to an increase in plasma membrane expression of GluR1(Q) as described previously (14Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R.

In the absence of stargazin, the amounts of GluR1(Q), GluR1(R), and GluR1(S) protein were comparable, whereas GluR1(T) showed rather weak expression. By contrast, GluR1(N) was expressed even more strongly than GluR1(Q) (Fig. 3A). Thus, the small current responses of GluR1(R), GluR1(T), and GluR1(S) are not due to a reduced protein expression compared with GluR1(Q) and GluR1(N) but rather to differences in their intrinsic electrophysiological properties. Coexpression of stargazin did not change the intensities of the bands relative to each other (Fig. 3B). A modest increase in the receptor amount in the plasma membrane upon coexpression of stargazin was detected for all mutants examined, similar to the wild type GluR1(Q). The fact that GluR1(Q) and GluR1(N) were expressed in the plasma membrane at higher levels than other mutants provides another hint that the homomeric assembly and trafficking to the plasma membrane of these two receptors may be favored. However, the moderate increase in protein amount upon stargazin coexpression cannot explain the huge increase in the current responses of these mutants. Therefore, we conclude that the observable increase in protein trafficking is not the main reason for the increase in current responses. Stargazin Modulates the Extent of Desensitization and the Kainate Efficacy in a Manner Dependent on the Amino Acid at the Q/R Site—Next, we set out to test how the amino acid located at the Q/R site of the receptor mutants influenced the electrophysiological properties. The widely used ratio of kainate- to glutamate-evoked current amplitudes (KA/Glu ratio) is an indicator of two such properties, the kainate efficacy and the extent of desensitization (see e.g. Refs. 14Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar and 17Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). High KA/Glu ratios can be caused either by strong desensitization upon glutamate application, relative to kainate application, or by a high relative kainate efficacy. It has previously been shown that both of these properties are affected by the interaction of stargazin with AMPARs (14Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 17Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Priel A. Kolleker A. Ayalon G. Gillor M. Osten P. Stern-Bach Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2682-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The extent of desensitization is smaller upon coexpression with stargazin than for the receptor alone, whereas kainate efficacy is increased. Here, we found a wide range of KA/Glu ratios for the different mutants. Some, like GluR1(N) and GluR1(Y), showed relatively low KA/Glu ratios of 8.0 ± 4.3 and 7.8 ± 2.9, respectively, whereas other mutants like GluR1(S) and GluR1(T) showed KA/Glu ratios of 14.0 ± 1.9 and 26.8 ± 4.4, respectively, which are more similar to the wild type GluR1(Q) KA/Glu ratio of 43.2 ± 7.7 (Fig. 4, A and B). A low KA/Glu ratio indicates that either the desensitization of the receptor is relatively weak upon glutamate application or that the relative kainate efficacy is low. By contrast, a high KA/Glu ratio indicates strong glutamate-mediated desensitization or a high relative kainate efficacy. GluR1(W) showed an extremely high KA/Glu ratio of 296.2 ± 49.4, indicating an almost complete desensitization upon glutamate application or an extremely high kainate efficacy. To distinguish whether the mutants showing a higher KA/Glu ratio than wild type GluR1(Q) are stronger desensitizing, or have higher kainate efficacies, we determined the KA/Glu ratio while reducing glutamate-induced desensitization by coapplication of cyclothiazide (CTZ) and the saturating agonist concentrations. The concentrations used were definitely saturating, even in the presence of CTZ, because CTZ as well as stargazin shifts the EC50 to lower values (14Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K.

In the presence of CTZ during glutamate application, all KA/Glu ratios decreased to values between 1.3 ± 0.08 for GluR1(N) and 4.5 ± 0.68 for GluR1(W) (Fig. 4, A and C), indicating that the main effect of stargazin on the receptor mutants is a modulation of the extent of desensitization, which is strongly dependent on the amino acid at the Q/R site. The remaining differences in the KA/Glu ratios may have been because of a Q/R site-dependent modulation of the kainate efficacy or could have been caused by a reportedly incomplete (24Partin K. Pantneau D. Mayer M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 129-138PubMed Google Scholar) CTZ-mediated abolishment of desensitization in flop isoforms. GluR1-flop was used in this study because it is the splice variant presumably expressed in the adult brain (25Jakowec M. Fox A. Martin L. Kalb R. Neuroscience. 1995; 4: 893-907Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Evidence that kainate efficacy is also affected by the interaction of stargazin with the receptor has been reported previously (17Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To test whether the remaining differences in the KA/Glu ratios found in the presence of CTZ were due to incomplete inhibition of receptor desensitization by CTZ or reflected a differentially modulated kainate efficacy, we combined several Q/R site mutants with the L479Y mutation, which is known to virtually abolish desensitization (26Stern-Bach Y.

Increasing evidence has suggested that telomeric 3′ G-tails can adopt a G-quadruplex conformation both in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of G-quadruplexes on the structure and function of telomeric 3′ G-tails remains unclear. In the current study, we showed that the human telomeric 3′ G-tail sequence protected the duplex DNA ends in cis from being recognized as double strand breaks. This protection is dependent on the G-quadruplex conformation of the 3′ G-tail sequence. These results suggest that the ability of telomeric 3′ G-tails to adopt the endprotecting G-quadruplex conformation may be one of the reasons for the existence of the evolutionarily conserved G-stretch motifs in telomeric DNA sequences.

Telomeres are special protein-DNA complexes at the ends of linear chromosomes in most eukaryotic cells. Interestingly, most telomeric sequences comprise similar guanine-rich repeats (1Wellinger R.J. Sen D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 735-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In human, chromosomal ends contain duplex TTAGG(G/A)ATCCC repeats exhibiting heterogeneity in size ranging from 2 to 30 kb (2Farr C. Fantes J. Goodfellow P. Cooke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7006-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). At the extreme ends of those duplex repeats are single-stranded 3′ overhangs, termed telomeric 3′ G-tails (4Makarov V.L. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). These 3′ G-tails, which range 130 to 200 bases in size, are extensions of the G-rich strand (TTAGGG) of the duplex repeats (4Makarov V.L. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Even though the structure and function of telomeric 3′ G-tails are largely unclear, recent studies have suggested that telomeric 3′ G-tails may exist in multiple states in vivo. For example, protein-coated 3′ G-tails have been proposed because proteins (e.g. human POT1 and yeast Cdc13p) that bind specifically to 3′ G-tails have been identified (5Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 6Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In addition, 3′ G-tails have been shown to form a T-loop structure in which the 3′ G-tail inserts into the preceding duplex region forming a large lariat structure at the chromosomal end (7Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 8Stansel R.M. de Lange T. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5532-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In addition to the protein-coated and T-loop structures, increasing evidence suggests that telomeric 3′ G-tails also exist in the G-quadruplex conformation, a four-stranded nucleic acid structure consisting of stacks of G-quartets (9Parkinson G.N. Lee M.P. Neidle S. Nature. 2002; 417: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). It is well documented that the telomeric 3′ G-tail sequences can form thermodynamically stable G-quadruplex conformation in vitro (10Yu H.Q. Miyoshi D. Sugimoto N. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. (Oxf.). 2006; 50: 207-208Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 11Yu H.Q. Miyoshi D. Sugimoto N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 15461-15468Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Several studies have also suggested the existence of telomeric G-quadruplexes in vivo. Studies in Stylonychia lemnae have demonstrated the existence of telomeric G-quadruplexes in the macronuclei using indirect immunofluorescence with a G-quadruplex-specific antibody (12Schaffitzel C. Berger I. Postberg J. Hanes J. Lipps H.J. Pluckthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8572-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In the same study, G-quadruplexes were not detected in the replication band, suggesting that the G-quadruplex conformation is resolved during DNA replication (12Schaffitzel C. Berger I. Postberg J. Hanes J. Lipps H.J. Pluckthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8572-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). More recently, using a fluorescent carbazole derivative, a G-quadruplex-specific ligand, the existence of an antiparallel G-quadruplex structure at telomeres of human metaphase chromosomes was detected (13Chang C.C. Chu J.F. Kao F.J. Chiu Y.C. Lou P.J. Chen H.C. Chang T.C. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 2810-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Chang C.C. Kuo I.C. Ling I.F. Chen C.T. Chen H.C. Lou P.J. Lin J.J. Chang T.C. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4490-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Additionally, another G-quadruplex-specific ligand, telomestatin, has been demonstrated to perturb telomere function in vivo, again suggesting the presence of telomeric G-quadruplexes (15Gomez D. Wenner T. Brassart B. Douarre C. O'Donohue M.F. El Khoury V. Shin-Ya K. Morjani H. Trentesaux C. Riou J.F. J. Biol.

Kolkes A. Shin-ya K. Riou J.F. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6908-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The in vivo significance of G-quadruplexes is also suggested from the presence of many G-quadruplex-specific proteins. For example, the telomere-binding/associated proteins, such as Rap1p, Stm1p, and Mre11p in budding yeast and the β-subunit of the Oxytricha telomere-binding protein, have been shown to bind telomeric G-quadruplexes (17Giraldo R. Rhodes D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2411-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Giraldo R. Suzuki M. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, many G-quadruplex-specific nucleases have also been identified, including the yeast nuclease encoded by the kem1 gene, and the nuclease GQN1 (G quartet nuclease 1), which does not cleave duplex DNA, single-stranded DNA, Holliday junctions, or G4 RNA (22Liu Z. Gilbert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Sun H. Yabuki A. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12444-12449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, members of the RecQ family, including Sgs1p, BLM (gene product of Bloom's syndrome), and WRN (gene product of Werner's syndrome), are apparently unique among cellular helicases in their ability to efficiently disrupt G-quadruplex DNA (24Mohaghegh P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the G-quadruplexes may have evolved to become biologically significant structures. One important function of telomeres is to protect the chromosome ends from being recognized as double strand breaks. Indeed, perturbation of telomeres can efficiently induce DNA damage response characteristic of DNA double strand breaks (e.g. γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci and ATM 2The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; AMA-37, arylmorpholine analog 37 (1-(2-hydroxy-4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-phenylmethanone); DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; oligo, oligodeoxynucleotide. autophosphorylation) (26Churikov D.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In addition, many DNA damage repair proteins (e.g. Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PK) are physically associated with telomeres and functionally involved in preventing fusions of deprotected telomeres (28d'Adda di Fagagna F.

Brenneman M.A. Halbrook J. Nickoloff J.A. Ullrich R.L. Goodwin E.H. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which telomeres protect the chromosome ends is still unclear, it has been suggested that the G-quadruplex conformation of telomeric 3′ G-tails could protect the otherwise exposed DNA double strand breaks (1Wellinger R.J. Sen D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 735-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we have investigated the possible role of the G-quadruplex conformation of the telomeric 3′ G-tails in protecting telomeric DNA ends from being recognized as DNA double strand breaks. Materials—VP-16 (etoposide) was purchased from Sigma. Arylmorpholine analog 37 (AMA-37; 1-(2-hydroxy-4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-phenylmethanone), a specific DNA-PK inhibitor, was purchased from Calbiochem. Phospho-Chk2 (Ser-33/35), phospho-Chk1 (Ser-317), and phospho-p53 (Ser-15) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-Mre11 antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals. Frozen pellets of HeLa cells were purchased from the National Cell Culture Center. A 1-kb DNA Ladder (consisting of up to 12 repeats of a 1018-bp DNA and DNA fragments ranging from 75 to 1636 bp) and a 10-bp DNA Step Ladder (10–100 bp of DNA fragments with 10-bp increments) were purchased from Invitrogen and Promega, respectively. All oligodeoxynucleotides used in this work were synthesized and purified by Integrated DNA Technologies. The sequences of the oligos used in this study are: 36 (a 36-mer duplex DNA), obtained by annealing single-stranded 36F (GAT GAA GAC TGT GCT CAT GAT GAA GAC TGT GCT CAT) and complementary single-stranded 36R (ATG AGC ACA GTC TTC ATC ATG AGC ACA GTC TTC ATC); 30, a 30-mer duplex DNA obtained by annealing single-stranded 30F (GAT GAA GAC TGT GCT CAT GAT GAA GAC TGT) and complementary single-stranded 30R (ACA GTC TTC ATC ATG AGC ACA GTC TTC ATC); H30, a 30-mer hairpin duplex DNA obtained by self-annealing a 65-mer single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide with the sequence CCC TAA TTC ATC ATG AGC ACA GTC TTC ATC CAA GAG ATG AAG ACT GTG CTC ATG ATG AAT TAG GG (the sequence of the hairpin loop is underlined); TG24, a 24-mer single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide with four tandem repeats of the human telomeric DNA sequence of TTAGGG; mTG24, the same single-stranded 24-mer DNA as TG24 except that the TTAGGG repeat sequence is replayed to TTAGTG; CA24, a 24-mer single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide with four tandem repeats of CCCTAA; D30, a dumbbell-like duplex DNA with a 30-mer duplex stem, obtained by self-annealing of a 70-mer single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide with the sequence AGC ACA GTC TTC ATC CAA GAG ATG AAG ACT GTG CTC ATG ATG AAT TAG GGC AAG ACC CTA ATT CAT CAT G (the two hairpin loop sequences are underlined). TEL30, TEL36, and TEL42 are duplex oligos containing five, six, and seven telomeric TTAGGG/AATCCC repeats, respectively. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the published procedure (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 5 × 108 ZR-75-1 or HeLa cells were suspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and a protease/phosphatase inhibitor mix that contains 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Isolated nuclei were then extracted with 1 volume of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease/phosphatase inhibitor mix) on ice for 30 min. Extracts were further centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was designated as the nuclear pellet. The supernatant, designated as nuclear extract, was aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. For assaying DNA damage signals, reactions (25 μl each) containing 10 μl of nuclear extract, 10 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm MnCl2), and 5 μl of a DNA substrate in TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA) were incubated at 32 °C for 15 min and then terminated by 20 μl of 6× Laemmli SDS gel sample buffer. Immunoblotting—The procedures were performed as described previously (31Zhou N. Xiao H. Li T.K. Nur-E-Kamal A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29532-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples in SDS gel sample buffer were boiled for 10 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was stained with Ponceau-S to confirm protein loading and then immersed in 5% milk for 1 h. The membrane filter was then incubated with specific antibody overnight followed by washes with TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20) and incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h. Bound secondary antibody was then detected by x-ray films using ECL reagents (Pierce). UV Melting Analysis—UV melting studies were conducted using a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectrically controlled cell holder. Quartz cells with a path length of 1 cm were used for the absorbance studies. Temperature-dependent absorption profiles were acquired at 295 nm with a 5-s averaging time. The temperature was raised in 1.0 °C increments, and the samples were allowed to equilibrate for 1.0 min at each temperature setting. In these UV melting studies, the DNA concentration was 1.0 (A260). Buffer solutions contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Prior to their use in UV melting experiments, all DNA solutions were preheated at 90 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature over a period of 4 h. Activation of DNA Damage Signals in Nuclear Extracts by Exogenous DNA Substrates—To study the possible protective effect of telomeric 3′ G-tails on chromosome ends, an in vitro system using nuclear extracts with exogenous DNA substrates was employed. This nuclear extract system, which was devoid of endogenous chromosomal DNA (see Fig. 1A, right panel, for the lack of any detectable histone H2A), was capable of reproducing many of the DNA damage signals in response to exogenous linear duplex DNA. As shown in Fig. 1A (left panel), duplex DNA oligos containing five (TEL30), six (TEL36), and seven (TEL42) human telomeric (TTAGG(G/A)ATCCC) repeats were capable of activating various DNA damage signals including phosphorylations of p53 (Ser-15), Chk2 (Ser-33/35), Chk1 (Ser-317), and c-Abl (Ser-735). Activation of these DNA damage signals was sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors caffeine (Fig. 1B, Caff.) and wortmannin (Wort.), suggesting the involvement of ATM, DNA-PK, and/or ATR. To examine the involvement of DNA-PK, a DNA-PKcs-specific inhibitor (AMA-37) was employed. AMA-37 is an ATP competitive inhibitor of DNA-PKcs with an IC50 value of ∼270 nm in 0.1 mm ATP (32Knight Z.A. Chiang G.G. Alaimo P.J. Kenski D.M. Ho C.B. Coan K. Abraham R.T. Shokat K.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Compared with the IC50 value, our results showed that AMA-37 effectively reduced the phosphorylation signal of p53 (Ser-15) to 50% at 10 μm in 0.5 mm ATP (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 5) and to less than 10% at 1 μm in 0.1 mm ATP (Fig. 1B, middle panel, lane 4) in the nuclear extract. It is noteworthy that AMA-37 does not inhibit ATM or ATR even at a concentration as high as 50 μm (32Knight Z.A. Chiang G.G. Alaimo P.J. Kenski D.M. Ho C.B. Coan K. Abraham R.T. Shokat K.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To test the possible involvement of ATM, the ATM-specific inhibitor (KU 55933) was used (33Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, KU 55933 at 1 μm did not inhibit p53 phosphorylation in either 0.1 (middle panel, lane 5) or 0.5 mm ATP (top panel, lane 5) (the IC50 is known to be 12.3 nm in 0.05 mm ATP for ATM inhibition) (33Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Only at 10 μm or higher did KU 55933 start to inhibit p53 phosphorylation, possibly because of its nonspecific inhibitory effect on DNA-PK. Together, these results suggest that DNA-PKcs is primarily responsible for the DNA damage signals activated by exogenous DNAs in this extract. Consistent with this interpretation, nuclear extracts prepared from ATM knock-out (L3) and wild-type (L40) cells exhibited similar levels of DNA damage signals in response to exogenous DNA substrates (data not shown). Effect of 3′ Overhangs on DNA End-activated DNA Damage Signals: Inhibition by the Telomeric 3′ G-tail Sequence—To study the protective effect of telomeric 3′ G-tails on DNA ends in the in vitro system, a series of DNA substrates were designed and tested for their ability to activate DNA damage signals. As shown in Fig. 2A, D30, a 30-mer dumbbell-like duplex DNA substrate with both ends protected by short (5 nucleotides) hairpin loops was ineffective in stimulating phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15). By contrast, H30, which was structurally identical to D30 except that one of the hairpin loops was removed resulting in exposure of one duplex DNA end, was highly efficient in activating phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15) (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–7). This result demonstrates the duplex end requirement for triggering DNA damage signals in this system. Additional studies using circular plasmid DNAs with and without restriction enzyme digestion confirmed this conclusion (data not shown). Next, we tested the effect of 3′ overhangs on the ability of the duplex end to activate DNA damage signals in this extract. As shown in Fig. 2A, H30-TG24 (see the structure in the right panel of Fig. 2B), which was structurally identical to H30 except that the duplex end contained a single-stranded 3′ overhang (TG24), was unable to stimulate phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15) (more than 100-fold reduction in the extent of phosphorylation as compared with H30), suggesting that the 3′ TG24 overhang inhibited DNA end-mediated DNA damage signaling in this extract. The ability of the 3′ overhang to inhibit the duplex DNA end-mediated DNA damage signal appeared to depend on the sequence rather than the duplex/overhang junction, because other 3′ overhangs did not exhibit the same inhibitory effect. As shown in Fig. 2A, H30-mTG24, which was structurally similar to H30-TG24 except that TG24 (3′ overhang) was replaced with mTG24 (a mutant form of TG24 with disrupted G-stretches in the repeats), strongly stimulated phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15) (Fig. 2A, lanes 11–13), suggesting that the G-stretch in the telomeric repeat (TTAGGG) is important for the inhibitory activity of TG24 3′ overhang. This conclusion was also supported by another experiment using an unrelated 24-mer 3′ overhang, CA24. As shown in Fig. 2B, H30-CA24, which was structurally identical to H30-TG24 except that the TG24 3′ overhang was replaced with a 3′ CA24 overhang (24-mer single-stranded oligo with four tandem repeats of the CCCTAA sequence), was highly effective in stimulating phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15) as well as Chk2 (Ser-33/35) and Chk1 (Ser-317). One possible explanation for the above results is that the single-stranded oligos CA24 and mTG24, but not TG24, per se may activate the DNA damage signals. This possibility was ruled out because neither CA24 nor mTG24 alone stimulated p53 (Ser-15) phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–9). Together, these results suggest that the inability of 30H/TG24 to induce DNA damage signals is due to a negative interference from the telomeric TG24 sequence. The Protective Effect of the Telomeric 3′ G-tail Sequence on DNA Ends Is G-quadruplex Conformation-dependent—The failure of mTG24 (four tandem repeats of TTAGTG) to protect the DNA duplex end suggested the importance of the G-stretches in TG24 (four tandem repeats of TTAGGG). It seems possible that the protective effect of TG24 on DNA end-mediated DNA damage signaling is due to its G-quadruplex conformation, which is readily formed with four G-stretches (10Yu H.Q. Miyoshi D. Sugimoto N. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. (Oxf.). 2006; 50: 207-208Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 11Yu H.Q. Miyoshi D. Sugimoto N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 15461-15468Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Qi H. Lin C.P. Fu X. Wood L.M. Liu A.A. Tsai Y.C. Chen Y. Barbieri C.M. Pilch D.S. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11808-11816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, UV melting analysis was performed on both TG24 and mTG24 sequences. It has been well documented that a transition from G-quadruplex conformation to single-stranded DNA conformation is characteristically associated with a decrease in absorbance at 295 nm (35Scaria P.V. Shire S.J. Shafer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10336-10340Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This is contrary to the transition from duplex DNA to single-stranded DNA conformation, which is characteristically associated with an increase in absorbance at 260 nm. As shown in Fig. 3A, TG24 underwent a melting transition (a sharp decrease in absorbance at 295 nm as revealed by a temperature derivative plot (dA/dT) at 61 °C (Tm), whereas mTG24 did not show any transition in the temperature employed in this study (15–95 °C), suggesting that TG24 but not mTG24 existed in the G-quadruplex conformation under our assay conditions (32 °C). UV melting analysis was also performed on three other substrates, H30, H30-TG24, and H30-mTG24. As shown in Fig. 3B, H30-TG24, but not H30 or H30-mTG24, showed a broad melting transition at 295 nm (Tm ≃ 50–65 °C), suggesting that TG24 existed in the G-quadruplex conformation in H30-TG24. These results argue that the G-quadruplex conformation of TG24 is responsible for its protective effect on the duplex end in H30-TG24. The Telomeric G-tail Sequence Protects DNA Ends in Cis—TG24 could possibly protect DNA ends in trans by titrating (inhibiting) some key signal transducers in the DNA damage signaling pathway. To test this possibility, a competition experiment was performed using TG24 as the competitor. As shown in Fig. 4, increasing amount of TG24 (0.04, 0.2, and 1 μm) had no effect on the phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15) induced by either H30-CA24 (Fig. 4A, lanes 7–9) or H30-mTG24 (Fig. 4A, lanes 10–12). Similarly, TG24 had no inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15) induced by either H30 (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–9) or the 36-mer duplex (Fig. 4B, lanes 10–12). These results demonstrated that the telomeric 3′ G-tail sequence, when introduced in trans, did not block DNA end-mediated DNA damage signaling. The cis effect of the 3′ G-tail sequence in protecting the DNA ends was also supported by the following experiment. In this experiment, additional substrates, 30 (30-mer duplex DNA), TG24-30 (30 with one 3′ TG24 overhang), and TG24-30-TG24 (30 with 3′ TG24 overhangs on both ends), were designed and tested in the nuclear extract. As shown in Fig. 5A, TG24-30-TG24, but not 30 or TG24-30, was unable to stimulate phosphorylation of p53 (Ser-15). This result suggests that each 3′ TG24 overhang can protect only one DNA end. Complete protection of the duplex DNA requires two 3′ TG24 overhangs, one on each end of the duplex DNA, consistent with the cis inhibition model. We next tested whether the 3′ TG24 overhang could block DNA end-mediated DNA damage signaling at a distance. Two substrates, TG24-30-T15 and TG24-30-T15-TG24, were designed and tested (for structures, see Fig. 5A, upper panel). Interestingly, TG24-30-T15, but not TG24-30-T15-TG24, stimulated p53 (Ser-15) phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the insertion of 15T between the duplex end and the 3′ TG24 overhang did not affect the inhibitory effect of the 3′ TG24 overhang. The identification of DNA-PK as responsible for activating the DNA damage signals by exogenously added duplex DNA in the nuclear extract is significant because the kinase activity of DNA-PK as well as other proteins involved in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair have been shown to be required to protect mammalian telomeres in vivo (29Bailey S.M. Brenneman M.A. Halbrook J. Nickoloff J.A. Ullrich R.L. Goodwin E.H. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Bailey S.M. Meyne J. Chen D.J. Kurimasa A. Li G.C. Lehnert B.E. Goodwin E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14899-14904Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA-PKcs and Ku subunits are known to be physically associated with telomeres in mammalian cells (28d'Adda di Fagagna F. Hande M.P. Tong W.M. Roth D. Lansdorp P.M. Wang Z.Q. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1192-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Consequently, the nuclear extract system employed in the current studies is likely to be biologically relevant. The substrates employed in the current studies were short duplex oligodeoxynucleotides with blunt ends or modified ends (e.g. small single-stranded DNA loops). We found that short linear duplexes with both ends capped by these hairpin loops (e.g. D30) were totally ineffective in activating the DNA damage signals. However, short linear duplexes with only one end capped by the hairpin loop (e.g. H30) were active in inducing the DNA damage signals. These results suggest that double-stranded DNA ends but not hairpin ends can induce DNA damage signals in the nuclear extract. Using one-end hairpincapped duplex substrates, we were able to study the effect of various 3′ overhangs on the other unprotected end. We showed that one-end-capped linear DNA duplex containing CA24 as the 3′ overhang (i.e. H30-CA24) was highly active in stimulating various DNA damage signals in this extract. Other duplex DNA substrates containing 3′ overhangs were generally quite effective in stimulating the DNA damage signals (data not shown). However, one-end-capped linear DNA duplex containing the telomeric 3′ G-tail (TG24) sequence as the overhang was far less effective (at least 100-fold less) in stimulating the DNA damage signals. The ability of the telomeric 3′ G-tail sequence, TG24, to protect the duplex end was highly sequence-specific, and a related sequence, mTG24, was completely ineffective in protecting the end. UV melting analysis has confirmed the existence of TG24 (and H30-TG24), but not mTG24 (and H30-mTG24), as a G-quadruplex. These results suggest that the end-protective effect is mediated by the G-quadruplex conformation of the human telomeric 3′ G-tail sequence, TG24. The mechanism by which TG24 mediates its end-protecting effect was investigated. The possibility that TG24 might titrate (inhibit) a key regulator (e.g. DNA-PK) in the extract was ruled out by a competition experiment in which TG24 was completely ineffective in protecting the ends when introduced in trans. The cis action of TG24 was also supported by the experiment in which complete protection required the presence of TG24 (as 3′ overhangs) at both ends. This experiment further suggested that the end-protecting effect of TG24 is of short range, because the presence of TG24 3′ overhang on one end does not protect the template, which still contains another unprotected end located 30 bp away. Thus, the cis effect of TG24 also excludes the scenario whereby the inability of the templates (H30TG24, TG24-30-TG24) to induce DNA damage signals is the result of degradation by nuclease/helicase or inactivation by template-coating proteins. The simplest explanation for the cis protective action of TG24 is proposed as a steric interference model in which the G-quadruplex conformation of TG24 may block the access of a key regulatory molecule(s) (e.g. DNA-PK, ATM) to the duplex/overhang junction (Fig. 6). To test this model, we inserted a single-stranded 15-mer (15T) in between the duplex end and TG24 3′ overhang. This new construct, TG25–30-15T-TG24, was still completely ineffective in stimulating DNA damage signals, suggesting that TG24 could still protect the end in cis with a 15-nucleotide separation between them. Although these results can still be accommodated by the steric interference model (Fig. 6), other possibilities cannot be ruled out. For example, TG24 in its G-quadruplex conformation may recruit additional protein(s) to form a large protein-DNA complex, restricting the access of DNA-PK to the duplex/overhang junction at least 15 bases away. Alternatively, the presence of the G-quadruplex may block the interaction between the 3′ end and the duplex/overhang junction, which may be necessary for end recognition (e.g. entry of a helicase from the 3′ end). Regardless of the molecular mechanism, the cis protective effect of the human telomeric 3′ G-tail sequence is most likely because of its G-quadruplex conformation. G-stretch-containing repeats are the fundamental units for most telomeric sequences. However, the reason for this evolutionarily conserved G-stretch motif is unclear (1Wellinger R.J. Sen D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 735-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Our results could provide an explanation for this conservation. As the main function of telomeres is to protect the DNA ends of linear chromosomes from being recognized as double strand breaks, it is likely that the sequence of 3′ G-tails is evolved to protect the chromosome ends because of its intrinsic property of adopting the stable G-quadruplex conformation. G-quadruplex conformation is likely to be part of the 3′ G-tail structural dynamics (1Wellinger R.J. Sen D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 735-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). During telomere replication in S phase, the telomeric G-quadruplexes need to be resolved for telomere replication by telomerase (12Schaffitzel C. Berger I. Postberg J. Hanes J. Lipps H.J. Pluckthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8572-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Many G-quadruplex-specific helicases (e.g. Werner, Bloom, Sgs1) can be involved to facilitate this process (24Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 25Sun H. Bennett R.J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Indeed, Werner helicase mutant has been shown to be defective in telomere lagging-strand synthesis, suggesting a physical hindrance at the 3′ G-tail (37Crabbe L. Verdun R.E. Haggblom C.I. Karlseder J. Science. 2004; 306: 1951-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The presence of different 3′ G-tail-specific binding proteins (e.g. human POT1 and yeast Cdc13p) may also be necessary to stabilize the single-stranded conformation of the G-tails in S phase. In budding yeast, temperature-sensitive mutant, cdc13-1, results in G2/M phase arrest and contains long telomeres at a restricted temperature (38Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, the growth arrest phenotype and abnormal telomere size can be rescued by introduction of a STM1 gene, encoding a G-quadruplex-specific binding protein, in a multicopy vector (19Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the SGS1 gene (encoding a G-quadruplex-specific helicase), can abolish the suppressor effect of STM1 on the cdc13-1 phenotype (19Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the G-quadruplex conformation at 3′ G-tails is tightly regulated by many factors and actively involved in the telomere maintenance. Clearly, additional studies will be necessary to establish the precise role of the G-quadruplex conformation in the structural dynamics of telomeric 3′ G-tails. We thank T. J. Thomas for technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2152305075,"Background The mechanisms responsible for generating rhythmic motor activity in the developing spinal cord of the chick embryo are poorly understood. Here we investigate whether the activity of motoneurons occurs before other neuronal populations at the beginning of each cycle of rhythmic discharge. Methodology/Principal Findings The spatiotemporal organization of neural activity in transverse slices of the lumbosacral cord of the chick embryo (E8-E11) was investigated using intrinsic and voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging. VSD signals accompanying episodes of activity comprised a rhythmic decrease in light transmission that corresponded to each cycle of electrical activity recorded from the ipsilateral ventral root. The rhythmic signals were widely synchronized across the cord face, and the largest signal amplitude was in the ventrolateral region where motoneurons are located. In unstained slices we recorded two classes of intrinsic signal. In the first, an episode of rhythmic activity was accompanied by a slow decrease in light transmission that peaked in the dorsal horn and decayed dorsoventrally. Superimposed on this signal was a much smaller rhythmic increase in transmission that was coincident with each cycle of discharge and whose amplitude and spatial distribution was similar to that of the VSD signals. At the onset of a spontaneously occurring episode and each subsequent cycle, both the intrinsic and VSD signals originated within the lateral motor column and spread medially and then dorsally. By contrast, following a dorsal root stimulus, the optical signals originated within the dorsal horn and traveled ventrally to reach the lateral motor column. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that motoneuron activity contributes to the initiation of each cycle of rhythmic activity, and that motoneuron and/or R-interneuron synapses are a plausible site for the activity-dependent synaptic depression that modeling studies have identified as a critical mechanism for cycling within an episode."
