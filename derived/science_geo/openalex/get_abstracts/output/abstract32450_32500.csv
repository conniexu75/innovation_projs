https://openalex.org/W2007385914,"Cellular and viral Fos proteins form a tight complex with other nuclear proteins, including the transcription factor and proto-oncogene AP-1/Jun. We have mapped the c-Jun binding site in Fos to a region containing regularly spaced leucine residues recently suggested to interdigitate with a similar structure in Jun. Substitution of single or multiple leucine residues or the alteration of leucine phasing by insertion of additional amino acids reduces or abolishes the binding to Jun, while the substitution of other amino acids has no noticeable effect. These results strongly suggest that the formation of a ""leucine zipper"" mediates the interaction between Fos and Jun. We also show that the differential binding of the various Fos mutants correlates with their potential to trans-activate AP-1-dependent transcription and to induce morphological transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2072724629,"Cytochrome P-450-dependent metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) increased in the kidneys of young, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) during the period of rapid elevation of blood pressure (BP) but not in adult SHRs or in Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs) with normal BP. Treatment of SHRs and WKYs with stannous chloride (SnCl2), which selectively depletes renal cytochrome P-450, restored BP to normal, coincident with a natriuresis, in young but not in adult SHRs and did not affect either BP or sodium excretion in WKYs. Depletion of renal cytochrome P-450 was associated with decreased generation of these AA metabolites only in young SHRs. The antihypertensive effect of SnCl2 in young SHRs was greatly reduced by prevention of its cytochrome P-450-depleting action."
https://openalex.org/W2128808695,"The number of G proteins identified by molecular cloning exceeds the number of known G protein functions. Here we show that a cell can possess multiple G proteins that carry out a similar function, the activation of phospholipase C, but couple selectively to different receptors, which are endogenous to the cell or introduced by DNA transfection. These G proteins (termed Gp) can be distinguished by their sensitivity to pertussis toxin. The assignment of a given Gp pathway to specific receptors is confirmed by the additivity relationships of the PI hydrolysis response mediated by the different receptors. Significantly different amounts of PI hydrolysis are activated through each Gp pathway, suggesting that Gp proteins also differ in their coupling to phospholipase C. These results indicate that distinct Gp pathways in a given cell exist to couple different receptors to PI hydrolysis selectively, and may specify the nature of the cellular response to different receptors by determining the magnitude of PI hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1970656914,"The Drosophila position-specific (PS) antigens are homologous to the vertebrate fibronectin receptor family, or integrins. A Drosophila gene required for embryonic morphogenesis, l(1)myospheroid, codes for a product homologous to the β subunit of the vertebrate integrins. l(1)myospheroid mutants die during embryogenesis. We show here that they lack the β subunit of the PS antigens. In the absence of the β subunit in mutant embryos, the PS α subunits are not expressed on the cell surface. We conclude that the l(1)myospheroid phenotype represents the lack-of-function phenotype for these Drosophila integrins. In wild-type embryos, PS antigens are found at the interface between mesoderm and ectoderm, and later mainly at the attachment sites of muscles to the epidermis and gut. Together these results indicate that during embryogenesis, Drosophila integrins are used to attach mesoderm to ectoderm, and are required for the proper assembly of the extracellular matrix and for muscle attachment."
https://openalex.org/W1528198451,"Stimulation of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) may result in the metabolism of phospholipids other than phosphoinositides to generate second-messenger intermediary metabolites. We investigated agonist-induced breakdown of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC), which constitutes almost half the diradyl-GPC fraction in human PMN (Mueller, H. W., O'Flaherty, J. T., Green, D. G., Samuel, M. P., and Wykle, R. L. (1984) J. Lipid Res. 25: 383-388), in cells prelabeled with 1-O-[3H] alkyl-2-acyl-GPC. We also utilized normal-phase high pressure liquid chromatography to quantitate the accumulation of diradylglycerols (1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerols and diacylglycerols) in stimulated PMN. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-, calcium ionophore A23187-, and f-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) stimulation of PMN resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent hydrolysis of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC and the formation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-phosphatidic acid (PA) and 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acylglycerol. In all cases formation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-PA preceded that of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acylglycerol. The times between addition of stimulus and appearance of 1-O-[3H] alkyl-2-acylglycerol varied for PMA (40 s at 1.6 microM), A23187 (5 min at 5 microM), and fMLP (30 sec at 1 microM). Preincubation of cells with 1 microgram/ml pertussis toxin (PT) inhibited the breakdown of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC in cells stimulated with 1 microM fMLP, indicating a role for a PT-sensitive G protein with this stimulus. Quantitation of diglycerides as diradylglycerobenzoates in PMN stimulated with PMA (10 min), A23187 (10 min), or fMLP demonstrated marked accumulation of both 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerols and diacylglycerols. The highest increases over controls were observed for fMLP (33-fold for 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerols and 17-fold for diacylglycerols). In stimulated PMN prelabeled with 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-acyl-GPC and 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-[32P]phosphocholine, the ratio of 3H to 32P in 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PA compared to 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC suggested the involvement of a phospholipase D in the hydrolysis of 1-O-[3H]-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC. Thus, stimulation of human PMN results in the hydrolysis of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC to yield 1-O-[3H] alkyl-2-acyl-PA and 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acylglycerol possibly initiated by activation of a phospholipase D.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2062521208,"During sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, expression of developmental genes spoIVCB and cotD is induced in the mother cell compartment of the sporangium at morphological stages IV and V, respectively. A 27-kilodalton RNA polymerase sigma factor called sigma K (or sigma 27) has been found that causes weak transcription of spoIVCB and strong transcription of cotD. A 14-kD protein was also discovered that changes the specificity of sigma K-containing RNA polymerase, greatly stimulating spoIVCB transcription and markedly repressing cotD transcription. Both sigma K and the 14-kD protein are products of genes known to be required for expression of specific genes in the mother cell. Thus, sigma K directs gene expression in the mother cell and it is proposed that inactivation or sequestering of the 14-kD protein switches the temporal pattern of gene expression during the transition from stages IV to V of development."
https://openalex.org/W2012517090,"Expression of outer membrane protein II (P.II) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is subject to reversible phase variation at a rate of 10(-3)-10(-4)/cell/generation. The signal peptide coding regions of P.II genes contain variable numbers of tandem repeats of the sequence CTCTT. Changes in the number of CTCTT units, leading to frameshifting within the gene, are responsible for changes in P.II expression. Phase variation mediated by the CTCTT repeat also occurred in E. coli, as assayed with a P.II-alkaline phosphatase (phoA) gene fusion. Phase variation in both the gonococcus and E. coli was recA-independent, occurred at similar rates, and involved insertions or deletions of one or more repeat units. The characteristics of the phase variation process were consistent with a model in which expression of P.II genes is regulated by slipped-strand mispairing of the DNA in the CTCTT repeat region."
https://openalex.org/W1993720213,"The maternally transcribed product of the Drosophila easter gene is essential for the establishment of a normal dorsal-ventral pattern in embryos. Loss-of-function mutations in easter result in a dorsalization of the embryonic pattern, while dominant gain-of-function mutations ventralize the embryonic pattern. P element insertion alleles of easter were isolated and used to identify genomic and cDNA clones that include the easter gene. Injection of in vitro-synthesized transcripts of the cDNA into embryos from easter mutant females completely rescued the mutant phenotype, allowing normal development. This result confirmed that the cDNA encodes easter and that the easter product is only required after fertilization. The sequence of the cDNA suggests that the product of the easter gene is an extracytoplasmic serine protease. The implications of the dominant alleles of this putative protease for the mechanism of dorsal-ventral pattern formation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2059027813,"A cellular sheath, the perineurium, forms a protective barrier around fascicles of nerve fibers throughout the peripheral nervous system. In a study to determine the cellular origin of perineurium, a culture system was used in which perineurium forms after purified populations of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts are recombined. Before recombination, the Schwann cells or the fibroblasts were labeled by infection with a defective recombinant retrovirus whose gene product, beta-galactosidase, is histochemically detectable in the progeny of infected cells. Perineurial cells were labeled when fibroblasts had been infected but not when Schwann cells had been infected. Thus, perineurium arises from fibroblasts in vitro and, by implication, in vivo as well."
https://openalex.org/W2044848214,"The T cell lymphokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), plays a pivotal role in an immune response by stimulating antigen-activated B lymphocytes to progress through the cell cycle and to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. An IL-2 inducible B lymphoma line, in which the growth and differentiation responses are uncoupled, provides a model system for dissecting the signaling mechanisms operating in each response. This system was used to show that both signals are initiated by IL-2 binding to a single, unifunctional receptor complex. Moreover, both signals are transduced by a pathway that does not involve any known second messenger system and that can be blocked by a second T cell lymphokine, interleukin 4. These findings suggest that the pleiotrophic effects of IL-2 are determined by different translations of the signal in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1987368313,"The chemical synthesis of biologically active peptides and polypeptides can be achieved by using a convergent strategy of condensing protected peptide segments to form the desired molecule. An oxime support increases the ease with which intermediate protected peptides can be synthesized and makes this approach useful for the synthesis of peptides in which secondary structural elements have been redesigned. The extension of these methods to large peptides and proteins, for which folding of secondary structures into functional tertiary structures is critical, is discussed. Models of apolipoproteins, the homeo domain from the developmental protein encoded by the Antennapedia gene of Drosophila, a part of the Cro repressor, and the enzyme ribonuclease T1 and a structural analog have been synthesized with this method."
https://openalex.org/W2117979987,"Activin, a dimer formed by the beta subunits of inhibin, has an effect that is opposite to that of inhibin in a number of biological systems. Which cell types secrete activin in vivo is not known. TM3 cells, a Leydig-derived cell line, contained messenger RNAs that hybridized with human beta A and beta B complementary DNA probes and were similar in size to the porcine messenger RNA for the beta subunits of inhibin. No hybridization to the inhibin alpha subunit was detectable in the TM3 cells. Conditioned medium from TM3 cells and from primary cultures of rat and porcine interstitial cells stimulated the release of follicle-stimulating hormone in a pituitary cell culture assay. It is likely that, in the testis, the Leydig cells secrete activin and the Sertoli cells produce inhibin, or a combination of both."
https://openalex.org/W1523767921,"Tyrosinase, the critical enzyme to melanin pigmentation in mammals, occurs as a series of isozymic forms, which have been previously regarded as different stages in processing of a single precursor form. Recently, three different cDNA clones have been identified which may encode tyrosinase, they share extensive sequence homology but are distinct; two of them have been mapped to genetic loci which regulate different aspects of melanogenesis. Since direct confirmation of the authentic tyrosinase sequence has proven impossible by conventional protein sequencing strategies, we have approached the identification of the tyrosinase gene by synthesizing peptides encoded by the putative genes and preparing antibodies to those peptides. By use of pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation analyses, and by enzymatic determinations, pMT4 (which maps to the brown b locus in mice) is shown to encode a molecule with tyrosinase catalytic activity which is biochemically identical with authentic tyrosinase. However, our results raise the possibility that other gene products may contribute to melanogenesis by one or more melanogenic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1519439704,"When guanosine 5'-(3-O-[35S]thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-binding activity was assayed in the particulate and cytosol fractions of human platelets, most activity was found in the particulate fraction. GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) were extracted from the particulate fraction by sodium cholate and purified by several column chromatographies. At least three G proteins with Mr values of about 21,000, 22,000, and 24,000 (21K G, 22K G, and 24K G, respectively) were separated in addition to the stimulatory (Gs) and inhibitory (Gi) regulatory GTP-binding proteins of adenylate cyclase. Among them, the amount of 22K G was more than 10-fold of those of other G proteins. 22K G was purified to near homogeneity and characterized. 22K G specifically bound GTP gamma S, GTP, and GDP, with a Kd value for GTP gamma S of about 50 nM. [35S]GTP gamma S binding to 22K G was inhibited by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide. 22K G hydrolyzed GTP to liberate Pi, with a turnover number of 0.01 min-1. 22K G was not copurified with the beta gamma subunits of Gs and Gi and was not recognized by the antibodies against the ADP-ribosylation factor for Gs and the ras protein. The peptide map of 22K G was different from those of the smg-25A and rho proteins, which we have purified from bovine brain membranes. 21K G was identified to be the c-ras protein, but 24K G was unidentified. These results indicate that there are multiple G proteins in platelet membranes and that a novel G protein (22K G) is a major G protein in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1483198897,"The uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor gene (ugi) of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage PBS2 has been subcloned to a 720-base pair DNA fragment contained in pZW2-0.7 and its nucleotide sequence determined. Using nucleotide deletion analysis, we have located the cloned ugi gene along with potential regulatory elements. A promoter-like region (−10 and −35 consensus sequences) similar to other B.subtilis genes and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence characteristic of Gram-positive bacteria were both identified upstream from the initiator AUG codon. A 17-nucleotide exact inverted repeat followed by runs of adenine and thymine residues was positioned almost immediately downstream of the ochre codon. The ugi gene product was identified on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels using Escherichia coli minicells containing pZW2-0.7 and by recovering uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor activity following electrophoresis. The ugi gene codes for an acidic polypeptide of 9,477 molecular weight (84 amino acids) whose electrophoretic mobility was greater than predicted for a protein of this size. The mode of inhibition did not appear to involve a catalytic process nor did it directly involve inhibitor-DNA interaction. Rather, the inhibitor protein was shown to bind physically to the E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase, forming a 36,000 molecular weight complex. This complex seems to be reversible, since inhibitor activity was recovered after heat treatment of the complex. In addition, we demonstrated that the inhibitor protein is active against uracil-DNA glycosylases isolated from several diverse biological sources but inactive against E. coli deoxyuridine triphosphatase, DNA polymerase I, and DNA polymerase α, β, and γ."
https://openalex.org/W2150832645,"Protein synthesis initiation factor 4D (eIF-4D) from mammalian cells contains the post-translationally modified lysine derivative hypusine. A highly purified preparation of the protein from rabbit reticulocytes was subjected to chemical and enzymatic cleavage, and a large number of overlapping peptides were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. Two mixed 14-base DNA probes were synthesized based on suitable amino acid sequences and were used to screen a human cDNA library in lambda gt11. A cDNA insert containing eIF-4D encoding sequences was identified and a 558-base pair EcoRI-PstI fragment was sequenced. Northern blot hybridization of HeLa cell RNA shows a single size class (1.2 kilobase) of mRNA. The DNA encodes a protein comprising 154 residues with a mass of 16,703 daltons. Human eIF-4D matches all of the rabbit peptides sequenced, extending from residue 9 to 154 except for Cys-129 which is Ser in the rabbit protein. The residue modified to hypusine is identified as Lys-50 and the amino terminus is blocked. eIF-4D possesses rather little secondary structure in the amino-terminal two-thirds of the protein, but the carboxyl-terminal third is rich in alpha helices."
https://openalex.org/W1495814740,"Abstract Lysosomal neuraminidase from human placenta has been obtained in its active form by association of an inactive neuraminidase polypeptide with beta-galactosidase and the protective protein. Using a specific antiserum, we have now identified a 66-kDa protein as the inactive neuraminidase polypeptide. It is specifically recognized on immunoblots only in its nonreduced state, and it coprecipitates with neuraminidase activity. The 66-kDa polypeptide is substantially glycosylated (38-kDa protein core with 7-14 N-linked oligosaccharide chains), a feature characteristic of lysosomal integral membrane proteins. Specific removal of the 66-kDa neuraminidase polypeptide from glycoprotein preparations prevents the generation of neuraminidase activity. Removal of beta-galactosidase or destruction of the protective protein also hinders the formation of active neuraminidase. Reconstitution of neuraminidase activity is observed after mixing glycoprotein preparations, depleted in different components of the beta-galactosidase-neuraminidase-protective protein complex, indicating that all three components of the complex are required for neuraminidase activity. Association of the neuraminidase polypeptide and the protective protein generates unstable neuraminidase activity, whereas association with beta-galactosidase is required for stability."
https://openalex.org/W1573492523,"The conversion of L-lysine to L-beta-lysine is catalyzed by lysine 2,3-aminomutase. The reaction involves the interchange of the 2-amino group of lysine with a hydrogen at carbon 3. As such the reaction is formally analogous to adenosylcobalamin-dependent rearrangements. However, the enzyme does not contain and is not activated by this coenzyme. Instead it contains iron and pyridoxal phosphate and is activated by S-adenosylmethionine. Earlier experiments implicated adenosyl-C-5' of S-adenosylmethionine in the hydrogen transfer mechanism, apparently in a role similar or analogous to that of adenosyl moiety of adenosylcobalamin in the B12-dependent rearrangements. The question of whether both hydrogens or only one hydrogen at adenosyl-C-5' participate in the hydrogen-transfer process has been addressed by carrying out the lysine 2,3-aminomutase reaction with S-[5'-3H] adenosylmethionine in the presence of 10 times its molar concentration of enzyme. Under these conditions all of the tritium appeared in lysine and beta-lysine, showing that C-5'-hydrogens participate. To determine whether hydrogen transfer is compulsorily intermolecular and intramolecular, various molar ratios of [3,3-2H2]lysine and unlabeled lysine were submitted to the action of lysine 2,3-aminomutase under conditions in which 10-15% conversion to beta-lysine occurred. Mass spectral analysis of the beta-lysine for monodeutero and dideutero species showed conclusively that hydrogen transfer is both intramolecular and intermolecular. The results quantitatively support our postulate that activation of the enzyme involves a transformation of S-adenosylmethionine into a form that promotes the generation of an adenosyl-5' free radical, which abstracts hydrogen from lysine to form 5'-deoxyadenosine as an intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1556237607,"Previous observations (Stolle, C.A., Pyeritz, R.E., Myers, J.C., and Prockop, D.J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1937-1944) indicated that fibroblasts from a proband with dominantly inherited Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV synthesized type III procollagen with a structural defect near the collagenase cleavage site at amino acid 781 and near the trypsin-sensitive site at 789. The type III procollagen was unusually sensitive to proteinases and cleaved by trypsin into a three-quarter fragment at 0 degrees C. Here we demonstrate that the mutation in the type III procollagen gene is a single base mutation that converts the codon for glycine at amino acid 790 of the alpha 1(III) chain to a codon for serine. The mutation probably makes the procollagen molecule unusually sensitive to proteases because it causes local unfolding of the triple helix and exposes the adjacent arginine residue. The results provide the first indication that not all glycine substitutions in the triple helices of fibrillar collagens are equivalent in terms of their effects of the biological function of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1973218146,"A 148-nucleotide subfragment of hepatitis delta virus RNA was shown to undergo cleavage and ligation reversibly. The direction of the reaction is determined by the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions, with the presence of Mg2+ favoring the cleavage reaction. Ligation requires specific conformation of the RNA molecules involved and occurs only between two cleaved RNA fragments that are still held together by hydrogen bonds. The ligation reaction occurs rapidly on removal of Mg2+ by EDTA. This represents a new class of RNA enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1545841075,"We examined the effects of apolipoproteins A-IV and A-I on the catabolism of whole particles by hepatoma G2 cells and cultured primary hepatocytes. For this type of experiment, high density lipoprotein is unsuitable, because all of its lipid and protein components independently dissociate and exchange and hence poorly trace whole particle catabolism. We therefore used phosphatidylcholine liposomes with radioactive tracers entrapped within their aqueous cores. Apolipoproteins A-IV, A-I, or E added to liposomes became liposome-associated and produced no detectable release of encapsulated label. As a positive control, apolipoprotein E doubled the uptake of labeled liposomes by hepatoma cells, compared to apolipoprotein-free controls, and this increase could be blocked by the addition of excess unlabeled low density lipoprotein. Degradation of labeled liposomes by hepatoma cells was increased 6-fold by the addition of apolipoprotein E. In contrast, neither apolipoprotein A-IV nor A-I increased cellular uptake or degradation of the particles. Similar results were obtained with primary hepatocytes. In studies using apolipoprotein combinations, apolipoproteins A-IV and A-I were each able to displace apolipoprotein E from liposomes and thereby reduce cellular uptake. Our data indicate that apolipoproteins A-IV and A-I do not facilitate uptake or degradation of whole particles by liver-derived cells in vitro. However, these apolipoproteins may modulate receptor-mediated uptake of particles by reducing the amount of particle-bound apolipoprotein E."
https://openalex.org/W1563752249,"A new water-soluble color reagent, 4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-isothiocyano-2'-sulfonic acid (S-DABITC), was used to identify lysine residues of antithrombin III which participate in the binding of heparin. Antithrombin, modified with S-DABITC in the presence and absence of low molecular weight heparin (Mr 5000) was reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. The digest was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and monitored at 465 nm. In the absence of heparin, four major colored peptides (T1, T2, T3, and T4) were identified. When antithrombin was preincubated with heparin (2-fold by weight), followed by S-DABITC modification, the recovery of peptide T4 remained unchanged, but the recoveries of T1, T2, and T3 were reduced by 93, 86, and 98%, respectively. In addition, a new colored peptide, TA, appeared. Amino acid sequencing of peptides T1, T2, T3, and TA localized S-DABITC modification sites as Lys-136, Lys-125, Lys-107, and Lys-236, respectively. Thus, binding of heparin to human antithrombin diminished S-DABITC modification at Lys-107, Lys-125, and Lys-136, but at the same time enhanced S-DABITC modification at Lys-236. This phenomenon was further characterized by varying the molar ratio of heparin/antithrombin (from 0.04 to 20). The shielding of Lys-125 and Lys-136 was inversely proportional to the activation of Lys-236. At a heparin/antithrombin molar ratio of 1, the extent of shielding of Lys-125 and Lys-136 and the unmasking of Lys-236 were 25-33%. This shielding-unmasking effect correlated with enhanced antithrombin inhibition of thrombin. We conclude that Lys-107, Lys-125, and Lys-136 are situated within the heparin-binding site of human antithrombin and that binding of heparin to antithrombin causes a conformational change of antithrombin that leads to the exposure of Lys-236 for S-DABITC modification."
https://openalex.org/W1598240089,"The effect of enzymatically generated reduced oxygen metabolites on the activity of hepatic microsomal glutathione S-transferase activity was studied to explore possible physiological regulatory mechanisms of the enzyme. Noradrenaline and the microsomal cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase system were used to generate reduced oxygen species. When noradrenaline (greater than 0.1 mM) was incubated with rat liver microsomes in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), an increase in microsomal glutathione S-transferase activity was observed, and this activation was potentiated in the presence of a NADPH-generating system; the glutathione S-transferase activity was increased to 180% of the control with 1 mM noradrenaline and to 400% with both noradrenaline and NADPH. Superoxide dismutase and catalase inhibited partially the noradrenaline-dependent activation of the enzyme. In the presence of dithiothreitol and glutathione, the activation of the glutathione S-transferase by noradrenaline, with or without NADPH, was not observed. In addition, the activation of glutathione S-transferase activity by noradrenaline and glutathione disulfide was not additive when both compounds were incubated together. These results indicate that the microsomal glutathione S-transferase is activated by reduced oxygen species, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Thus, metabolic processes that generate high concentrations of reduced oxygen species may activate the microsomal glutathione S-transferase, presumably by the oxidation of the sulfhydryl group of the enzyme, and this increased catalytic activity may help protect cells from oxidant-induced damage."
https://openalex.org/W1498244831,"Abstract Radiolabel pulse-chase and subcellular fractionation procedures were used to analyze the transport, proteolytic processing, and sorting of two lysosomal enzymes in Dictyostelium discoideum cells treated with the weak bases ammonium chloride and chloroquine. Dictyostelium lacks detectable cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors and represents an excellent system to investigate alternative mechanisms for lysosomal enzyme targeting. Exposure of growing cells to ammonium chloride, which increased the pH in intracellular vacuoles from 5.4 to 5.8-6.1, slowed but did not prevent the proteolytic processing and correct localization of pulse-radiolabeled precursors to the lysosomal enzymes alpha-mannosidase and beta-glucosidase. Additionally, ammonium chloride did not affect transport of the enzymes to the Golgi complex, as they acquired resistance to the enzyme endoglycosidase H at the same rate as in control cells. When the pH of lysosomal and endosomal organelles was raised to 6.4 with higher concentrations of ammonium chloride, the percentage of secreted (apparently mis-sorted) precursor polypeptides increased slightly, but proteolytic processing of intermediate forms of lysosomal enzymes to mature forms was greatly reduced. The intermediate and mature forms of alpha-mannosidase and beta-glucosidase did, however, accumulate intracellularly in vesicles similar in density to lysosomes. In contrast, in cells exposed to low concentrations of chloroquine the intravacuolar pH increased only slightly (to 5.7); however, enzymes were inefficiently processed and, instead, rapidly secreted as precursor molecules. Experiments involving the addition of chloroquine at various times during the chase of pulse-radiolabeled cells demonstrated that this weak base acted on a distal Golgi or prelysosomal compartment to prevent the normal sorting of lysosomal enzymes. These results suggest that although acidic endosomal/lysosomal compartments may be important for the complete proteolytic processing of lysosomal enzymes in Dictyostelium, low pH is not essential for the proper targeting of precursor polypeptides. Furthermore, certain amines may induce mis-sorting of these enzymes by pH-independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1537911550,"The competition between CO2 and O2 at the active site of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase limits net CO2 fixation in photosynthesis. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a mutation in the chloroplast large-subunit gene reduces the CO2/O2 specificity of the enzyme by 37% and causes valine-331 to be replaced by alanine. Revertant selection identified an intragenic suppressor mutation that increases the CO2/O2 specificity of the mutant enzyme by 33%. This second-site mutation causes threonine-342 to be replaced by isoleucine. The complementing amino acid substitutions flank a catalytically essential lysyl residue at position 334. It thus appears that a number of amino acid residues can influence the CO2/O2 specificity of this bifunctional enzyme. The well defined chloroplast genetics of C. reinhardtii allows the interactions of these residues to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1562459571,"Abstract Depleting the mitochondrial matrix of divalent cations with the ionophore A23187 activates a pH-sensitive, anion uniport pathway which can transport many anions normally regarded as impermeant (Beavis, A. D., and Garlid, K. D. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15085-15093). Addition of valinomycin to respiring mitochondria can also induce the uptake of a wide variety of anions; however, the mechanism of anion transport during this swelling is less certain. In this paper, I demonstrate that both of these processes are inhibited by a variety of cationic amphiphiles including propranolol, quinine, amiodarone, imipramine and amitriptyline, and the benzodiazepine R05-4864. Although the IC50 values for the two processes are not equal, the ratio of IC50 values for the two processes appears to be the same for all drugs. Measurements of net transmembrane proton fluxes that occur during the assays reveal that respiration-induced swelling is associated with extensive proton ejection, the peak of which coincides with the maximum rate of anion transport. Moreover, from measurements of matrix buffering power, it is estimated that the matrix pH is 3 units more alkaline during respiration-induced swelling than during A23187-induced swelling. It is also shown that the IC50 for A23187-induced transport is pH-dependent in a manner consistent with modulation of drug binding by protonation of two sites. These findings allow the difference in IC50 values for the two types of assay to be explained by the pH dependence of the binding constant for the drug. Furthermore, the pH gradient generated during respiration-induced swelling is so large that the electrical component of the proton-motive force will be negligible. Thus, despite the fact that the mitochondria are energized, rapid electrophoretic anion influx is possible. These data provide evidence that the transport of anions in these two types of assay occurs via the same pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1493558178,"Ca2+ has been recently reported to be required for high rates of translational initiation in GH3 pituitary cells (Chin, K.-V., Cade, C., Brostrom, C.O., Galuska, E.M., and Brostrom, M.A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16509–16514). In the present investigation low concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophores, A23187 and ionomycin, were found to rapidly suppress the Ca2+-dependent component of protein synthesis in GH3 cells. More ionophore was required to inhibit amino acid incorporation into protein as extracellular Ca2+ was increased. Pre-existing inhibitions of protein synthesis produced by low concentrations of ionophore at low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations were reversed by adjustment to high extracellular Ca2+. Treatment with ionophore reduced the cellular contents of polysomes and 43 S preinitiation complex to values equivalent to those found for Ca2+-depleted cells. Average ribosomal transit times were unaffected by ionophore, and treated cells retained the ability to accumulate polysomes when incubated with cycloheximide. Cell types, such as HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary, that normally display only a modest Ca2+-dependent component of protein synthesis, manifested a strong underlying Ca2+ dependence in amino acid incorporation and polysome formation following treatment with low concentrations of ionophore. Protein synthesis in GH3 or HeLa cells during recovery from heat shock and arsenite treatment was not affected by cellular Ca2+ depletion or ionophore treatment. On the basis of these results, Ca2+ ionophore is proposed to inhibit Ca2+-dependent translational initiation through facilitating the mobilization of sequestered intracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1482037247,"Aldose reductase (ALR2) has been purified to homogeneity from human psoas muscle. From sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis the enzyme is monomeric and has a molecular weight of 37,000. ALR2 catalyzes the primarily NADPH-dependent reduction of a wide variety of aldehydes, although the enzyme can also utilize NADH. The best substrates for ALR2 are aromatic aldehydes (e.g. pyridine-3-aldehyde; Km = 9 microM; kcat/Km = 150,000 s-1 M-1), while among aldoses DL-glyceraldehyde is the preferred substrate (Km = 72 microM; kcat/Km = 17,250). Low (100 microM) concentrations of CaCl2 and CaSO4 cause a marked inhibition (90%) of ALR2 as do higher concentrations (0.2 M) of MgCl2. (NH4)2SO4 caused a 2-fold activation of ALR2. The enzyme is also inhibited by quercetin and the commercially developed aldose reductase inhibitors alrestatin and sorbinil. ALR2 is inhibited only very slightly by sodium valproate and barbiturates. ALR2 cross-reacts immunologically with human brain and human placental aldose reductase and with ALR2 from monkey tissue. There is no precipitin cross-reaction of ALR2 with aldose reductases from other species nor with human aldehyde reductase 1 (ALR1) or with ALR1 from other species. The data show that human muscle is a new and relatively rich source of a monomeric NADPH/NADH reductase which is clearly identifiable as aldose reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1492272638,"Abstract An investigation was made to determine whether it is possible to attract tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to the site of a thrombus by means of an antibody with affinites for both tPA and fibrin. A bispecific antibody conjugate was constructed by cross-linking two monoclonal antibodies: one specific for tPA, the other specific for fibrin. The bispecific antibody enhanced fibrinolysis by capturing tPA at the site of a fibrin deposit. In an in vitro quantitative fibrinolysis assay, the relative fibrinolytic potency of tPA bound to the bispecific antibody was 13 times greater than that of tPA and 200 times greater than that of urokinase. When fibrin was treated with the bispecific antibody before being mixed with tPA, the relative fibrinolytic potency of tPA was enhanced 14-fold. This capture also occurred when the concentration of tPA present in the assay was less than the concentration of tPA present in normal human plasma. In a human plasma clot assay, samples containing both the bispecific antibody and tPA exhibited significantly more lysis than did samples containing tPA alone. In spite of the increased clot lysis effected by the presence of bispecific antibody, there was no significant increase in fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin degradation at equal tPA concentrations. The ability of the bispecific antibody to concentrate exogenous tPA in vivo was then examined in the rabbit jugular vein model. Systemic infusion of a small amount of tPA (10,000 units) produced no significant increment in thrombolysis over the level of spontaneous lysis (14 +/- 8%). However, the simultaneous infusion of 10,000 units of tPA and 2 mg of bispecific antibody resulted in 42 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01) lysis. These results suggest that a molecule capable of binding both fibrin and tPA with high affinity could enhance thrombolysis in the circulation by capturing endogenous tPA."
https://openalex.org/W1510649668,"The reaction of aldose reductase from human psoas muscle with either pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) or pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (PLP-AMP) results in a pseudo first-order 2-fold activation of the enzyme with the stoichiometric incorporation of 1 mol of either reagent per mol of enzyme. However, in addition to an increase in Vmax there was also an increase in Km for both substrate, DL-glyceraldehyde, and coenzyme, NADPH. This resulted in an overall decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Spectral analysis indicated that activation by both PLP and PLP-AMP was accompanied by Schiff's base formation and epsilon-pyridoxyllysine was identified in hydrolysates of the reduced enzyme PLP-complex. Digestion of either PLP-modified or PLP-AMP-modified aldose reductase with endoproteinase Lys-C followed by high performance liquid chromatography purification and amino acid sequencing of the pyridoxyllated peptide revealed that PLP and PLP-AMP had modified the same lysine residue. A 32-residue peptide containing the essential lysine was found to be highly homologous with a segment of the sequence of both human liver aldehyde reductase and rat lens aldose reductase. A tetrapeptide (Ile-Pro-Lys-Ser) containing the essential lysine was identical in all three enzymes. These results highlight the close structural similarity between members of the aldehyde reductase family."
https://openalex.org/W1518909319,"Abstract Previous reports described the properties of a high affinity (Ka = 1.7 X 10(10) M-1) prototype anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody 4-4-20, an intermediate affinity (Ka = 3.7 X 10(7) M-1) prototype 9-40, and Ig members of the 9-40 idiotype family (comprised of 3-24, 5-14, 5-27, 10-25 and 12-40). Although the seven monoclonal anti-fluorescein antibodies expressed similar active site structural determinants (idiotypes) as determined serologically, each was characterized by different affinities for fluorescein and fine specificity binding patterns. Partial heavy (H)- and light (L)-chain N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses revealed all antibodies (except 5-27) were composed of highly homologous VHIII(C) and V kappa II subgroup genes, respectively. Antibody 5-27 utilized a VHIII(B) and a V kappa V subgroup genes and shared low V-region sequence homology with 4-4-20, 9-40 and the remaining 9-40 idiotype family. In addition, complete 4-4-20, VH- and VL-region primary structures were determined to better understand antibody-antigen interactions. Antibody 4-4-20 utilized a VHIII(C) subgroup VH-gene, a truncated Sp2 D gene segment, JH4, a V kappa II subgroup VL-gene, and J kappa 1. Antibody 4-4-20 VH and VL complementarity-determining regions contained many basic and aromatic amino acid residues capable of interaction with fluorescein. Results are discussed in terms of idiotypic and fluorescein-binding characteristics as well as antibody structural and functional diversity in the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1530076784,"The mitochondrial sulfurtransferase, rhodanese, has been analyzed for phosphate content. Significant amounts of protein-bound phosphate (30–40%) were measured in the six rhodanese preparations examined. Chromatographic experiments followed by phosphate analyses done on two of the preparations indicated that rhodanese A and rhodanese B, two enzyme forms that were previously resolved on DEAE-Sephadex by Blumenthal and Heinrikson (Blumenthal, K., and Heinrikson, R. L. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 240, 2430–2437), correspond to dephospho- and phosphorhodanese, respectively. The phosphorylation of rhodanese by [γ-32P]ATP is catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The stoichiometry of 32P incorporation based on the amount of dephosphorhodanese in the enzyme preparation approaches 1.0. The phosphorylation site is accessible in rhodanese that is free of substrate sulfur but not in the covalent enzyme-sulfur intermediate which is formed as an obligatory step during the course of catalysis. Because the cellular localization of cAMP-dependent protein kinase makes it unlikely as the physiologic modulator of rhodanese activity, liver extracts have been tested for a rhodanese kinase that does not require cAMP. Rhodanese kinase activity which is independent of cAMP is observed in extract fractions resolved by Affi-Gel Blue chromatography and freed from endogenous rhodanese by chromatography on Sephadex G-100. These results together with previous findings from this and other laboratories have led to a working model of a bicyclic cascade system that can modulate the rate of mitochondrial respiration. The essence of the model is a transduction and amplification of cellular signals into the altered covalent phosphorylation of rhodanese. Rhodanese, in turn, serves as a converter enzyme which directly alters the rate of the respiratory chain and, thus, ATP production by the reversible sulfuration of key iron-sulfur centers. The model, when expanded to include signal pathways initiated by hormones or neurotransmitters, represents a mechanism by which mitochondria can recognize and meet changing energy demands."
https://openalex.org/W1553687169,"Abstract Heat shock in vivo or brief incubation at moderately elevated temperatures (15 min at 37 degrees C) in vitro is required for the structural stability of proteinaceous karyoskeletal elements purified from Drosophila melanogaster (McConnell, M., Whalen, A. M., Smith, D. E., and Fisher, P. A. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 1087-1098). We have found that the appearance of the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II in karyoskeletal preparations is promoted by conditions identical to those which promote in vitro stability of karyoskeletal elements overall. Increased levels of polymerase II in karyoskeletal protein-enriched fractions correlate with decreased levels of nucleotide incorporation in nuclear transcription run-on assays. These results are not easily reconciled with the proposal that putative karyoskeletal elements such as the internal nuclear matrix are sites of active transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1586631087,"Carbonyl sulfide, a competitive inhibitor of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase with respect to CO2 (Laing, W. A., and Christeller, J. T. (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 202, 592-600), is an alternate substrate. Thiocarboxylation was monitored by mass spectrometry as the stoichiometric consumption of carbonyl sulfide. The product, 1-thio-3-phosphoglycerate, was identified by 13C NMR and UV absorption spectroscopy and measured by enzymic conversion to thiolactate, coupled to the oxidation of NADH. The expected stoichiometry of thiocarboxylation was confirmed. The maximal rates of thiocarboxylation for the spinach and Rhodospirillum rubrum enzymes were close to the maximal rates of carboxylation for these two enzymes. Both enzymes favored CO2 over carbonyl sulfide (with Mg2+ as metal ion) by a factor of about 110. Thiocarboxylation could only be demonstrated with enzymes carbamylated with CO2. Incubation of the carbamylated E.ACO2.Mg complex with excess carbonyl sulfide caused the displacement of the activator carbamate. The thiocarbamylated enzyme was catalytically incompetent and did not form a stable quaternary complex with 2'-carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate. Incubation of the thiocarbamylated enzyme with excess CO2 resulted in the displacement of the thiocarbamate, the re-formation of the carbamylated E.ACO2.Mg complex and the restoration of catalytic competence. Computergraphic simulation of the thiocarbamylated quaternary complex indicated unfavorable van der Waals interactions associated with the thiocarbamate."
https://openalex.org/W1552938235,"The ermC 23 S rRNA methyltransferase converts a single adenine residue to N6,N6-dimethyladenine, both in vivo and in vitro. The ermC methyltransferase was demonstrated to produce both N6-mono and N6,N6-dimethylated adenine residues in Bacillus subtilis 23 S rRNA during the course of the reaction in vitro. An almost total conversion of monomethylated intermediates into dimethylated products was observed upon completion of the reaction. Data presented here demonstrate that the addition of the two methyl groups to each 23 S rRNA molecule takes place through a monomethylated intermediate and suggest that the enzyme dissociates from its RNA substrate between the two consecutive methylation reactions. The enzyme is able to utilize monomethylated RNA as substrate for the addition of a second methyl group with an efficiency approximately comparable to that obtained when unmethylated RNA was the initial substrate. Initial-rate data and inhibition studies suggest that the ermC methylase reaction involves a sequential mechanism occurring by two consecutive Random Bi Bi reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1579199746,"Brain spectrin, through its beta subunit, binds with high affinity to protein-binding sites on brain membranes quantitatively depleted of ankyrin (Steiner, J., and Bennett, V. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14417-14425). In this study, calmodulin is demonstrated to inhibit binding of brain spectrin to synaptosomal membranes. Submicromolar concentrations of calcium are required for inhibition of binding, with half-maximal effects at pCa = 6.5. Calmodulin competitively inhibits binding of spectrin to protein(s) in stripped synaptosomal membranes, with Ki = 1.3 microM in the presence of 10 microM calcium. A reversible receptor-mediated process, and not proteolysis, is responsible for inhibition since the effect of calcium/calmodulin is reversed by the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine and by chelation of calcium with sodium [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid. The target of calmodulin is most likely the spectrin attachment protein(s) rather than spectrin itself since: (a) membrane binding of the brain spectrin beta subunit, which does not associate with calmodulin, is inhibited by calcium/calmodulin, and (b) red cell spectrin which binds calmodulin very weakly, is inhibited from interacting with membrane receptors in the presence of calcium/calmodulin. Ca2+/calmodulin inhibited association of erythrocyte spectrin with synaptosomal membranes but had no effect on binding of erythrocyte or brain spectrin to ankyrin in erythrocyte membranes. These experiments demonstrate the potential for differential regulation of spectrin-membrane protein interactions, with the consequence that Ca2+/calmodulin can dissociate direct spectrin-membrane interactions locally or regionally without disassembly of the areas of the membrane skeleton stabilized by linkage of spectrin to ankyrin. A membrane protein of Mr = 88,000 has been identified that is dissociated from spectrin affinity columns by calcium/calmodulin and is a candidate for the calmodulin-sensitive spectrin-binding site in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1588664264,"The ability of Ehrlich tumor cell alpha(1,3)-galactosyltransferase to catalyze the incorporation of alpha-D-Gal residues into a specific branch of bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary oligosaccharides has been investigated by acetolysis followed by gel filtration of the fragments on Bio-Gel P-4. Taking advantage of the carbohydrate specificity of the Griffonia simplicifolia I-B4 isolectin, the mono-[14C]alpha-D-Gal derivatives were isolated by affinity chromatography. Analysis of the acetolysis fragments generated by cleavage of the multiantennary substrates indicates that the Ehrlich cell alpha(1,3)-galactosyltransferase acts preferentially on the alpha-D-Man(1,6) arm. This branch is preferred 2.5 times in bi-, 5.6-8.5 times in tri-, and 12.7 times in tetraantennary structures over the alpha-D-Man(1,3) arm. Within the alpha-D-Man(1,6) branch, in turn, there is a 1.3-1.9-fold consistently higher frequency of galactosylation of the beta-D-GlcNAc(1,2) as compared to the beta-D-GlcNAc(1,6) antenna."
https://openalex.org/W1586849889,"Abstract The internalization of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) by A431 cells was investigated. Control cells were able to internalize over 80% of receptor-bound 125I-EGF. By contrast, cells treated with EGF before incubation with 125I-EGF internalized only 50% of the surface-bound radioligand. The ligand-induced decrease in 125I-EGF internalization showed a dose response to EGF with half-maximal effect occurring at 3 nM. The alteration in the extent of 125I-EGF internalization did not require extended treatment with high concentrations of the hormone. When the internalization of picomolar versus nanomolar concentrations of EGF were compared, the lower concentrations of 125I-EGF were more completely internalized than the higher concentrations of radioligand. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that occupation of the EGF receptor by hormone rapidly leads to the activation of cellular processes which effectively desensitize the system to further ligand-induced internalization. The decrease in the extent of ligand internalization occurred in cells in which the protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) activity had been down-regulated by prolonged treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate implying that the desensitization process is independent of protein kinase C. However, the effects of EGF on the extent of hormone internalization could be mimicked by the addition of A23187 and could be prevented by pretreatment of the cells with calmodulin antagonists suggesting the possibility that Ca2+-calmodulin is involved in the regulation of EGF receptor internalization in A431 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593606055,"The basal lamina components laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), and type IV collagen were synthesized and codeposited in the extracellular matrix (ECM) by a cultured human cell line from gestational choriocarcinoma (JAR). Laminin and HSPG formed a noncovalent complex detected by the coimmunoprecipitation of HSPG with laminin from cell lysates and culture media. The complex was stable in the cell lysis buffer that contained detergents (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and sodium chloride (from 0.15 to 1.0 M), but was dissociated by adding 8 M urea to the detergent lysates. Even though JAR cells produced roughly equal amounts of HSPG and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, only HSPG complexed with laminin, suggesting a specific interaction between these basal lamina components. The laminin-HSPG complex was deposited and retained in the ECM. This was shown biochemically by isolating an enriched fraction of ECM from JAR cells cultured on native type I collagen gels. At steady state, more than half (52%) of the laminin-HSPG in the culture was recovered in the ECM fraction, in contrast to 16% of the total laminin and 29% of the total type IV collagen, which were secreted to a greater extent than laminin-HSPG into the culture medium. The retention of the laminin-HSPG complex in the ECM suggests that it may participate in the assembly of the basal lamina-like extracellular matrix deposited by JAR cultures. Omission of ascorbate from the culture medium abolished the ECM deposition of type IV collagen but had little effect on the deposition of laminin or laminin-HSPG. This demonstrates that the stable deposition of laminin-HSPG and laminin in the collagen-based choriocarcinoma cultures is not dependent on an assembled network of type IV collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1511960757,"A melanoma proteoglycan model system has been used to examine the role of core protein asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides in the transport and assembly of proteoglycan molecules. The use of agents which block discrete steps in the trimming and processing of core oligosaccharides (castanospermine, 1-deoxynojirimycin, N-methyldeoxynojirimycin, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, and swainsonine) demonstrates that removal of glucose residues from the N-linked oligosaccharides is required for the cell surface expression of a melanoma proteoglycan core protein and for the conversion of the core protein to a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. However, complete maturation of the oligosaccharides to a form is not required for these events. Treatment of M21 human melanoma cells with the glucosidase inhibitors castanospermine, 1-deoxynojirimycin, or N-methyldeoxynojirimycin results in a dose-dependent inhibition of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) addition to the melanoma antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody 9.2.27. In contrast, treatment with the mannosidase inhibitors 1-deoxymannojirimycin and swainsonine does not effect GAG addition. Identical results are obtained when the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen gamma chain proteoglycan is examined in inhibitor-treated melanoma and B-lymphoblastoid cells. These data, in conjunction with the known effects of the glucosidase and mannosidase inhibitors on the transport and secretion of other glycoproteins support the hypothesis that the addition, trimming, and processing of N-linked oligosaccharides is involved in the transport of certain proteoglycan core proteins to the site of GAG addition and to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1601333957,"Abstract Fibroblasts from many patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) synthesize and secrete Type I collagen which is both overmodified and exhibits a decreased thermal denaturation temperature. We have examined the relationship between overmodification and decreased melting temperature in several favorable OI mutants by selectively inhibiting lysyl hydroxylase activity with the drug Minoxidil and comparing the melting profiles of the resultant undermodified collagen with untreated control. Minoxidil treatment causes an appreciable decrease in hydroxylysine with compensatory increases in lysine content, and the delayed sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility of the overmodified collagen chains becomes normal. However, the decreased melting temperature was unchanged from untreated OI control. When unhydroxylated collagen produced by normal control and OI fibroblasts incubated with alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl was examined, mutant OI molecules melted at a lower temperature than control. These data indicate that the decreased thermal denaturation temperature of OI mutant collagen is independent of post-translational overmodification of lysine or hydroxylysine. Presumably, substitutions for glycine in the Gly-X-Y structural motif distort the helix and produce lower melting temperatures by presently unknown mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1494102549,"Abstract Clostridium botulinum D (strain South Africa) produces ADP-ribosyltransferase which modifies eukaryotic 24-26-kDa proteins. ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was associated with a neurotoxin of 150 kDa (Dsa toxin) as confirmed by the elution profile of Dsa toxin from high performance anion-exchange column. The 24-kDa substrate of Dsa toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was detected in several tissues examined including rat brain, heart, and liver; bovine adrenal medulla; sea urchin eggs; electric organs of electric fish; and cell lines of neural (N18, N1E115, NS20Y, NG108, PC12, and C6) and non-neural (3T3) origins, suggesting its ubiquitous localization in eukaryotic cells. On the other hand, the 26-kDa substrate was detected only in membrane fractions of neural tissues and neuronal cells, suggesting its specific localization in membrane of nerve terminals. ADP-ribosylation of both the 24-kDa substrate in PC12 membrane and the 24-26-kDa substrates in rat brain membrane was potentiated by either divalent cations or guanine nucleotides, whereas adenine nucleotides did not affect the ADP-ribosylation reaction. Trypsin digestion of the 24-kDa substrate in PC12 membrane and the 24-26-kDa substrates in rat brain membrane extract produced different tryptic fragments indicative of the structural difference between the 24- and 26-kDa substrates. Both the 24- and 26-kDa substrates were less sensitive to trypsin digestion before being ADP-ribosylated by Dsa toxin than after, suggesting the conformational alterations of the 24-26-kDa proteins induced by ADP-ribosylation. These results suggest that Dsa toxin modifies two distinct low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins by ADP-ribosylation to alter their putative function(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1560941354,"The degree of phosphorylation of ribosome-associated proteins of intact GH3 pituitary tumor cells before and after Ca2+ depletion was examined. A 26-kDa ribosome-associated protein was found to dephosphorylate upon Ca2+ depletion of the cells and to re-phosphorylate upon restoration of the cation. This protein was distinct from eukaryotic initiation factor 4E on the basis of subcellular distribution, antigenicity, and susceptibility to dephosphorylation in Ca2+-depleted cells. Temporal correlation was observed between the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state of the 26-kDa protein, and the stimulation/inhibition of protein synthesis by Ca2+ repletion/depletion. Phosphorylation of the 26-kDa protein was rapidly abolished in Ca2+-repleted cells by the ionophore, A23187, which elevates cytosolic Ca2+ while reducing sequestered cation. Dephosphorylation of the protein and inhibition of protein synthesis occurred at comparable times after addition of ionophore. The novelty of a Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation supported by sequestered rather than cytosolic free Ca2+ is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1680498713,"We report a simple type of reciprocal chromosomal translocation in the LOU rat IgE-secreting immunocytoma cell line, IR162, involving the c-myc protooncogene and the switch region of the epsilon immunoglobulin heavy chain, c-myc/S epsilon. By cloning and sequencing the translocation-associated and the homologous normal c-myc and S epsilon DNAs, we have identified the position of the translocational junction in both the c-myc 5'-flanking region and the repetitive elements of the S epsilon region. The translocational recombination was precise, and no insertion or N-addition was found in the junctional region, leaving all the c-myc exons, together with two promoter sites, intact. RNase mapping confirmed that the same promoters were utilized in IR162 and normal LOU spleen cells. No point mutation was found in the 5'-flanking region and the 3'-portion of exon 1 of the translocated c-myc gene. However, the putative silencer region was lost with the translocation. It was also noticed that a strikingly AT-rich sequence associated with S epsilon region had translocated to the 5'-flanking region of c-myc gene. We discuss the possibility that a change of DNA topology, perhaps either due to the juxtaposition of an AT-rich sequence of the S epsilon region, or to the loss of the putative silencer element, may contribute to c-myc gene deregulation in IR162."
