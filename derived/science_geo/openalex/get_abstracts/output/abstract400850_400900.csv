https://openalex.org/W1981097208,"Clinical studies consistently demonstrate that a single sub-psychomimetic dose of ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) antagonist, produces fast-acting antidepressant responses in patients suffering from major depressive disorder, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Depressed patients report the alleviation of major depressive disorder symptoms within two hours of a single, low-dose intravenous infusion of ketamine, with effects lasting up to two weeks, unlike traditional antidepressants (serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which take weeks to reach efficacy. This delay is a major drawback to current therapies for major depressive disorder and faster-acting antidepressants are needed, particularly for suicide-risk patients. The ability of ketamine to produce rapidly acting, long-lasting antidepressant responses in depressed patients provides a unique opportunity to investigate underlying cellular mechanisms. Here we show that ketamine and other NMDAR antagonists produce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects in mouse models, and that these effects depend on the rapid synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We find that the ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDAR at rest deactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase (also called CaMKIII), resulting in reduced eEF2 phosphorylation and de-suppression of translation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Furthermore, we find that inhibitors of eEF2 kinase induce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects. Our findings indicate that the regulation of protein synthesis by spontaneous neurotransmission may serve as a viable therapeutic target for the development of fast-acting antidepressants."
https://openalex.org/W2085544097,"Gene targeting in embryonic stem cells has become the principal technology for manipulation of the mouse genome, offering unrivalled accuracy in allele design and access to conditional mutagenesis. To bring these advantages to the wider research community, large-scale mouse knockout programmes are producing a permanent resource of targeted mutations in all protein-coding genes. Here we report the establishment of a high-throughput gene-targeting pipeline for the generation of reporter-tagged, conditional alleles. Computational allele design, 96-well modular vector construction and high-efficiency gene-targeting strategies have been combined to mutate genes on an unprecedented scale. So far, more than 12,000 vectors and 9,000 conditional targeted alleles have been produced in highly germline-competent C57BL/6N embryonic stem cells. High-throughput genome engineering highlighted by this study is broadly applicable to rat and human stem cells and provides a foundation for future genome-wide efforts aimed at deciphering the function of all genes encoded by the mammalian genome."
https://openalex.org/W2051816002,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is stored in the extracellular matrix as a latent complex with its prodomain. Activation of TGF-β1 requires the binding of α(v) integrin to an RGD sequence in the prodomain and exertion of force on this domain, which is held in the extracellular matrix by latent TGF-β binding proteins. Crystals of dimeric porcine proTGF-β1 reveal a ring-shaped complex, a novel fold for the prodomain, and show how the prodomain shields the growth factor from recognition by receptors and alters its conformation. Complex formation between α(v)β(6) integrin and the prodomain is insufficient for TGF-β1 release. Force-dependent activation requires unfastening of a 'straitjacket' that encircles each growth-factor monomer at a position that can be locked by a disulphide bond. Sequences of all 33 TGF-β family members indicate a similar prodomain fold. The structure provides insights into the regulation of a family of growth and differentiation factors of fundamental importance in morphogenesis and homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2172172109,"Nanoporous molecular frameworks are important in applications such as separation, storage and catalysis. Empirical rules exist for their assembly but it is still challenging to place and segregate functionality in three-dimensional porous solids in a predictable way. Indeed, recent studies of mixed crystalline frameworks suggest a preference for the statistical distribution of functionalities throughout the pores rather than, for example, the functional group localization found in the reactive sites of enzymes. This is a potential limitation for 'one-pot' chemical syntheses of porous frameworks from simple starting materials. An alternative strategy is to prepare porous solids from synthetically preorganized molecular pores. In principle, functional organic pore modules could be covalently prefabricated and then assembled to produce materials with specific properties. However, this vision of mix-and-match assembly is far from being realized, not least because of the challenge in reliably predicting three-dimensional structures for molecular crystals, which lack the strong directional bonding found in networks. Here we show that highly porous crystalline solids can be produced by mixing different organic cage modules that self-assemble by means of chiral recognition. The structures of the resulting materials can be predicted computationally, allowing in silico materials design strategies. The constituent pore modules are synthesized in high yields on gram scales in a one-step reaction. Assembly of the porous co-crystals is as simple as combining the modules in solution and removing the solvent. In some cases, the chiral recognition between modules can be exploited to produce porous organic nanoparticles. We show that the method is valid for four different cage modules and can in principle be generalized in a computationally predictable manner based on a lock-and-key assembly between modules."
https://openalex.org/W2125012012,"Amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's are associated with the transformation of normally soluble proteins into amyloid fibrils — elongated, unbranched protein aggregates. Inhibitors of pathological amyloid fibril formation may be useful as therapeutics if they are sufficiently specific. Sievers et al. use computer-aided, structure-based design, with known atomic structures of segments of amyloid fibres as templates, to evolve a D-amino-acid peptide that delays amyloid fibril formation. Many globular and natively disordered proteins can convert into amyloid fibrils. These fibrils are associated with numerous pathologies1 as well as with normal cellular functions2,3, and frequently form during protein denaturation4,5. Inhibitors of pathological amyloid fibril formation could be useful in the development of therapeutics, provided that the inhibitors were specific enough to avoid interfering with normal processes. Here we show that computer-aided, structure-based design can yield highly specific peptide inhibitors of amyloid formation. Using known atomic structures of segments of amyloid fibrils as templates, we have designed and characterized an all-d-amino-acid inhibitor of the fibril formation of the tau protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and a non-natural l-amino-acid inhibitor of an amyloid fibril that enhances sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Our results indicate that peptides from structure-based designs can disrupt the fibril formation of full-length proteins, including those, such as tau protein, that lack fully ordered native structures. Because the inhibiting peptides have been designed on structures of dual-β-sheet ‘steric zippers’, the successful inhibition of amyloid fibril formation strengthens the hypothesis that amyloid spines contain steric zippers."

https://openalex.org/W2124358336,"Background Recent studies suggest that internet addiction disorder (IAD) is associated with structural abnormalities in brain gray matter. However, few studies have investigated the effects of internet addiction on the microstructural integrity of major neuronal fiber pathways, and almost no studies have assessed the microstructural changes with the duration of internet addiction. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the morphology of the brain in adolescents with IAD (N = 18) using an optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technique, and studied the white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) changes using the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method, linking these brain structural measures to the duration of IAD. We provided evidences demonstrating the multiple structural changes of the brain in IAD subjects. VBM results indicated the decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the cerebellum and the left rostral ACC (rACC). DTI analysis revealed the enhanced FA value of the left posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and reduced FA value in the white matter within the right parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Gray matter volumes of the DLPFC, rACC, SMA, and white matter FA changes of the PLIC were significantly correlated with the duration of internet addiction in the adolescents with IAD. Conclusions Our results suggested that long-term internet addiction would result in brain structural alterations, which probably contributed to chronic dysfunction in subjects with IAD. The current study may shed further light on the potential brain effects of IAD."
https://openalex.org/W2139976683,"Since it was discovered that the anti-hypertensive agent ifenprodil has neuroprotective activity through its effects on NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, a determined effort has been made to understand the mechanism of action and to develop improved therapeutic compounds on the basis of this knowledge. Neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors is essential for basic brain development and function. These receptors form heteromeric ion channels and become activated after concurrent binding of glycine and glutamate to the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, respectively. A functional hallmark of NMDA receptors is that their ion-channel activity is allosterically regulated by binding of small compounds to the amino-terminal domain (ATD) in a subtype-specific manner. Ifenprodil and related phenylethanolamine compounds, which specifically inhibit GluN1 and GluN2B NMDA receptors, have been intensely studied for their potential use in the treatment of various neurological disorders and diseases, including depression, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Despite considerable enthusiasm, mechanisms underlying the recognition of phenylethanolamines and ATD-mediated allosteric inhibition remain limited owing to a lack of structural information. Here we report that the GluN1 and GluN2B ATDs form a heterodimer and that phenylethanolamine binds at the interface between GluN1 and GluN2B, rather than within the GluN2B cleft. The crystal structure of the heterodimer formed between the GluN1b ATD from Xenopus laevis and the GluN2B ATD from Rattus norvegicus shows a highly distinct pattern of subunit arrangement that is different from the arrangements observed in homodimeric non-NMDA receptors and reveals the molecular determinants for phenylethanolamine binding. Restriction of domain movement in the bi-lobed structure of the GluN2B ATD, by engineering of an inter-subunit disulphide bond, markedly decreases sensitivity to ifenprodil, indicating that conformational freedom in the GluN2B ATD is essential for ifenprodil-mediated allosteric inhibition of NMDA receptors. These findings pave the way for improving the design of subtype-specific compounds with therapeutic value for neurological disorders and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2088873069,"All three translation termination codons, or nonsense codons, contain a uridine residue at the first position of the codon. Here, we demonstrate that pseudouridylation (conversion of uridine into pseudouridine (Ψ), ref. 4) of nonsense codons suppresses translation termination both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo targeting of nonsense codons is accomplished by the expression of an H/ACA RNA capable of directing the isomerization of uridine to Ψ within the nonsense codon. Thus, targeted pseudouridylation represents a novel approach for promoting nonsense suppression in vivo. Remarkably, we also show that pseudouridylated nonsense codons code for amino acids with similar properties. Specifically, ΨAA and ΨAG code for serine and threonine, whereas ΨGA codes for tyrosine and phenylalanine, thus suggesting a new mode of decoding. Our results also suggest that RNA modification, as a naturally occurring mechanism, may offer a new way to expand the genetic code."

https://openalex.org/W2010941702,"Double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious of the DNA lesions that initiate genomic instability and promote tumorigenesis. Cells have evolved a complex protein network to detect, signal, and repair DSBs. In mammalian cells, a key component in this network is H2AX, which becomes rapidly phosphorylated at Ser(139) (γ-H2AX) at DSBs. Here we show that monoubiquitination of H2AX mediated by the RNF2-BMI1 complex is critical for the efficient formation of γ-H2AX and functions as a proximal regulator in DDR (DNA damage response). RNF2-BMI1 interacts with H2AX in a DNA damage-dependent manner and is required for monoubiquitination of H2AX at Lys(119)/Lys(120). As a functional consequence, we show that the H2AX K120R mutant abolishes H2AX monoubiquitination, impairs the recruitment of p-ATM (Ser(1981)) to DSBs, and thereby reduces the formation of γ-H2AX and the recruitment of MDC1 to DNA damage sites. These data suggest that monoubiquitination of H2AX plays a critical role in initiating DNA damage signaling. Consistent with these observations, impairment of RNF2-BMI1 function by siRNA knockdown or overexpression of the ligase-dead RNF2 mutant all leads to significant defects both in accumulation of γ-H2AX, p-ATM, and MDC1 at DSBs and in activation of NBS1 and CHK2. Additionally, the regulatory effect of RNF2-BMI1 on γ-H2AX formation is dependent on ATM. Lacking their ability to properly activate the DNA damage signaling pathway, RNF2-BMI1 complex-depleted cells exhibit impaired DNA repair and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Together, our findings demonstrate a distinct monoubiquitination-dependent mechanism that is required for H2AX phosphorylation and the initiation of DDR."

We determined protein/lipid components of lumenal lipid droplets (LLD) in cells expressing recombinant human apoC-III (C3wt) or a mutant form (K58E, C3KE) initially identified in humans that displayed hypotriglyceridemia. Although expression of C3wt markedly stimulated secretion of TAG and apoB-100 as VLDL1, the K58E mutation (located at the C-terminal lipid binding domain) abolished the effect in transfected McA-RH7777 cells and in apoc3-null mice. Metabolic labeling studies revealed that accumulation of TAG in LLD was decreased (by 50%) in cells expressing C3KE. A Fat Western lipid protein overlay assay showed drastically reduced lipid binding of the mutant protein. Substituting Lys58 with Arg demonstrated that the positive charge at position 58 is crucial for apoC-III binding to lipid and for promoting TAG secretion. On the other hand, substituting both Lys58 and Lys60 with Glu resulted in almost entire elimination of lipid binding and loss of function in promoting TAG secretion.

The nascent VLDL particle is further enlarged in TAG content through a “second step” lipidation process, where a bulk TAG (presumably present within the microsomal lumen in the form of lipid droplet) is incorporated (1Sundaram M.

Although much has been learned about the co- and post-translational lipidation of apoB-100, little is known about the nature or the dynamics of these lumenal lipid droplets (LLD) that are utilized as lipid precursor for VLDL assembly. Early studies with the abetalipoproteinemia gene MTTP suggested that the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is required for the partitioning of VLDL lipid precursor, mainly TAG, into the microsomal lumen in mouse liver (2Raabe M.

Thus, inactivation of MTP in the liver cells was associated with lack of LLD and invariably resulted in diminished assembly and secretion of VLDL.

In vitro studies suggested that the lipid binding activity of apoC-III resides within the C-terminal region encompassing amino acid residues 41–79 (15Sparrow J.T. Gotto Jr., A.M. Morrisett J.D. Proc.

Thus, mutation at the N-terminal region (e.g. A23T) does not appear to affect apoC-III binding to lipid (6Sundaram M. Zhong S. Bou Khalil M. Zhou H. Jiang Z.G. Zhao Y. Iqbal J. Hussain M.M. Figeys D.

In the current work we tested the effect of the naturally occurring mutation K58E (16von Eckardstein A. Holz H. Sandkamp M. Weng W. Funke H. Assmann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1724-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that is located within the lipid binding domain of apoC-III. Clinical data showed that the heterozygous K58E carriers had increased HDL (>95th percentiles of sex matched controls) and lowered VLDL as well as lowered VLDL-apoC-III (15% of normal) (16von Eckardstein A. Holz H. Sandkamp M. Weng W. Funke H. Assmann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1724-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The present data have demonstrated that the K58E mutation entirely abolished the apoC-III stimulatory effect on assembly and secretion of TAG-rich VLDL and resulted in markedly retarded accumulation of LLD in transfected cells. Thus, the lipid binding domain of apoC-III plays a key role in the formation of LLD utilized for VLDL assembly and secretion under lipid-rich conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2062867276,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no effective disease modifying treatment. Following-on from studies in HD animal models, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has emerged as an attractive therapeutic option. In parallel, several reports have demonstrated a role for histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) in the modulation of the toxicity caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, including that of expanded polyglutamine in an N-terminal huntingtin fragment. An important role for HDAC6 in kinesin-1 dependent transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from the cortex to the striatum has also been demonstrated. To elucidate the role that HDAC6 plays in HD progression, we evaluated the effects of the genetic depletion of HDAC6 in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Loss of HDAC6 resulted in a marked increase in tubulin acetylation throughout the brain. Despite this, there was no effect on the onset and progression of a wide range of behavioural, physiological, molecular and pathological HD-related phenotypes. We observed no change in the aggregate load or in the levels of soluble mutant exon 1 transprotein. HDAC6 genetic depletion did not affect the efficiency of BDNF transport from the cortex to the striatum. Therefore, we conclude that HDAC6 inhibition does not modify disease progression in R6/2 mice and HDAC6 should not be prioritized as a therapeutic target for HD."
https://openalex.org/W2135371218,"The mechanisms that regulate keratinocyte migration and proliferation in wound healing remain largely unraveled, notably regarding possible involvements of microRNAs (miRNAs). Here we disclose up-regulation of miR-483-3p in 2 distinct models of wound healing: scratch-injured cultures of human keratinocytes and wounded skin in mice. miR-483-3p accumulation peaks at the final stage of the wound closure process, consistent with a role in the arrest of ""healing"" progression. Using an in vitro wound-healing model, videomicroscopy, and 5-bromo-2'-uridine incorporation, we observed that overexpression of miR-483-3p inhibits keratinocyte migration and proliferation, whereas delivery of anti-miR-483-3p oligonucleotides sustains keratinocyte proliferation beyond the closure of the wound, compared with irrelevant anti-miR treatment. Expression profiling of keratinocytes transfected with miR-483-3p identified 39 transcripts that were both predicted targets of miR-483-3p and down-regulated after miR-483-3p overexpression. Luciferase reporter assays, Western blot analyses, and silencing by specific siRNAs finally established that kinase MK2, cell proliferation marker MKI67, and transcription factor YAP1 are direct targets of miR-483-3p that control keratinocyte proliferation. miR-483-3p-mediated down-regulation of MK2, MKI67, and YAP1 thus represents a novel mechanism controlling keratinocyte growth arrest at the final steps of reepithelialization."

Breast cancer is becoming an important public health issue globally. The etiology of breast cancer is complex; this hyperproliferative disorder involves morphological and cellular transformation, dysregulation of apoptosis, uncontrolled cellular proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis (1Schneider B.P.

All cell culture wares were from Sarstedt (Newton, NC), and fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Human breast carcinoma cells MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The capillary endothelial cells were from the laboratory stock of a non-transformed endothelial cell line (21Banerjee D.K. Ornberg R.L. Youdim M.B. Heldman E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4702-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Athymic Balb/c female (nu/nu) mice were from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The capillary endothelial cell stock was maintained as previously described (21Banerjee D.K. Ornberg R.L. Youdim M.B. Heldman E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Viable cells were counted every 24 h. Protein tyrosine kinase activity (23Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) was measured in a Ray Bio® (RayBiotech; Norcross, GA) cell-based phosphotyrosine ELISA kit in synchronized cells treated with tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) for 3 h in triplicate following incubation with VEGF165 (10 ng/well) for 10 min prior to tunicamycin addition. CBO-II (50 μm), a VEGF receptor inhibitor was added 30 min prior to the addition of VEGF165. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analyses were performed as before (13Martínez J.A. Tavárez J.J. Oliveira C.M. Banerjee D.K. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with 7.5% gel concentration. (a) Isolation of RNA: total RNA was isolated in TRIzol, treated with DNase, and quantified in a NanoDrop Bioanalyzer. The integrity of RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. (b) qRT-PCR: total RNA (2 μg) was used to generate cDNA using the iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit. qRT-PCR was performed in an iCycler (Bio-Rad) using iQTM SYBR® Green Supermix for the double-stranded DNA. After optimizing the PCR conditions, reactions with SYBR® Green PCR master mix, forward/reverse primers (10 μm), and cDNA (100 ng) were performed. PCR parameters used were 95 °C for 3 min (required for iTaqTM DNA polymerase activation), 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, and 1 min at 50 °C (annealing). The PCR products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The quantification of the target gene expression relative to the total DNA was carried out by melting curve analysis and calculated by ΔCt = Cthousekeeping − Cttarget gene. The changes in target gene expression in tunicamycin-treated cells compared with the control are reported as ΔΔCt = ΔCtcontrol − ΔCttunicamycin where the Cttarget and CtGAPDH are the fractional cycle number at which fluorescence generated by reporter dye exceeded the fixed level above baseline for target and housekeeping genes. The relative expression of the target gene in the control and tunicamycin-treated samples was calculated as 2ΔΔCt. Each sample was run three times. The PCR primer pairs used were: mouse thrombospondin (forward): 5′-TGCGATGATGACGATGAC-3′; (reverse) 5′-CAGGGTTGTGGTTGTAGG-3′; mouse GAPDH (forward): 5′-GCCTTCCGTGTTCCTACC-3′; (reverse) 5′-TCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGC-3′; bovine thrombospondin (forward): 5′-GCCGATTCCAGATGATTC-3′; (reverse) 5′-CATAACCTACAGCAAGTCC-3′; and bovine GAPDH (forward): 5′-TGACCCCTTCATTGACCTTC-3′; (reverse) 5′-GATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATG-3′. BD BioCoat MatrigelTM invasion chambers were used according to the manufacturer's instruction. The conditioned media from MCF7 cells containing 10% fetal bovine serum and VEGF165 (10 ng) were placed in lower chambers as a chemoattractant. Tunicamycin (1 μg/ml)-treated or untreated capillary endothelial cells (1 × 105) in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were seeded in the upper chamber of the MatrigelTM-coated (growth factor-reduced) transwell. After incubating for 24 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, non-migrating cells from the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The cells invaded to the lower side of the membrane were fixed, stained with H&E, and quantified by counting in five fields under a Zeiss optical microscope (200×). The chemotaxis was performed as described before (24Zhang Z. Banerjee A. Baksi K. Banerjee D.K. Biocatal. Biotransform. 2010; 28: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). MatrigelTM (0.5 ml) containing heparin (60 units/ml) (negative control), heparin plus VEGF165 (30 ng; positive control), or heparin plus VEGF165 plus tunicamycin (5 μg, experimental) per mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank of 8-week-old female Balb/c (nu/nu) mice. Five mice per group were used. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The mice were killed 10 days postimplantation. MatrigelTM plugs were removed, fixed in 10% neutral formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Breast tumor tissue from nude mice was also processed similarly. 5-μm sections were collected on glass slides, stained with H&E, and analyzed microscopically (Axioskop 2, Carl Zeiss, Germany). For microsvessel counting, the MatrigelTM sections were stained immunohistochemically with anti-CD34 and anti-CD144 antibodies using the HistomouseTM Max kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). A similar protocol was used to detect Ki-67 and VEGF expression in breast tumor tissue sections. De-paraffinized sections were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (10 min) at room temperature, washed with PBS, pH 7.4 (3 × 3 min each), and blocked with solutions A and B for 30 min and 10 min, respectively. The sections were incubated at room temperature with anti-CD34, anti-CD144, anti-Ki-67, anti-VEGF, and anti-GRP-78 antibodies, respectively, in a moist chamber for 3 h. After rinsing with PBS, pH 7.4 (3 × 2 min each), the sections were incubated with 100 μl of HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 10 min at room temperature. The sections were rinsed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with a mixture of chromogenic substrate (cold) for 15 min. After washing with distilled water, all sections were counterstained with hematoxylin before mounting and analysis. In some experiments, GRP-78 and CD144 were detected with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. N-Glycans were detected with Texas-Red-conjugated WGA. MVC were analyzed using the hot spot area. H&E-stained sections as well as the sections immunostained with anti-CD34 and anti-CD144 antibodies were analyzed in 3 hot spots (i.e. the highest number of vessel areas under 200× magnification). Microscopic images from each area were collected (100×/0.25 ph1 A plan) in Axioskop 2 fitted with AxioCam MRc5 camera and Axion Vision Rel 4.6 software, and recorded as the MVC (25Robinson D.R.

One week later, mice bearing the tumor were divided into five groups (10 mice per group). Mice in the treatment group received tunicamycin intravenously (i.v.) at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg per week, while the mice in the control group received i.v. injection of the vehicle only. Taxol (15 mg/kg) was used as an internal control. Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurements of length and width for 23 days after initiating the treatment and the tumor volume was calculated. At the end, the mice were sacrificed, the excised tumor was weighed and fixed in formalin. Paraffin embedded and frozen tumor sections were analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically. (b) Xenograft Model: 4 × 106 MDA-MB-231 (a triple negative breast cancer) cells mixed with 0.3 ml of MatrigelTM and injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the hind region of the mouse. One week later, the mice bearing tumor were divided into two groups. The mice in the treatment group received tunicamycin (5 μg/mouse ≈ 0.25 mg/kg) orally twice a week for 4 weeks, while the mice in the control group received the vehicle only. The tumor growth was monitored as above. Tumor tissue was immunostained with Texas-red-conjugated WGA and photographed at 200× magnification. The fluorescence intensity of each vessel was quantified by ImageJ version 1.39 (NIH). RGB composite images from control and tunicamycin-treated vessels were created using Axion Vision rel, 4.6 and analyzed. Vessels from five different areas were used for statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out with Graph Pad Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Quantitative data are presented as mean plus S.E. The mean ± S.E. was calculated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance between groups was further analyzed using the post hoc Tukey's test. Tunicamycin (a potent protein N-glycosylation inhibitor) arrests capillary endothelial cells in G1 (21Banerjee D.K. Ornberg R.L. Youdim M.B. Heldman E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To evaluate the stability of the anti-angiogenic effect of tunicamycin in tumor microenvironment, a time course was set up where VEGF165-stimulated capillary endothelial cells were treated with tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) and monitored every 24 h for 144 h. Exogenous addition of VEGF165 stimulated the cell proliferation, but it failed to protect the cells from the growth inhibitory effect of tunicamycin (Fig. 1A). In the first 24 h of VEGF treatment, the inhibition of cell proliferation was less but from 48 h onwards VEGF did not show any protection (p < 0.001). VEGF signals through activation of tyrosine kinase (23Zwick E. Bange J. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 25Robinson D.R. Wu Y.M. Lin S.F. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 5548-5557Crossref Scopus (859) Google Scholar). We have tested the status of the VEGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity after treating the cells with tunicamycin. Cells stimulated with VEGF165 exhibited an increase in tyrosine kinase activity over the basal level. A marked reduction in the enzyme activity (p < 0.001) however, was observed in cells treated with tunicamycin for 3 h (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the specificity of VGF165-stimulated up-regulation of the tyrosine kinase activity, a 17 amino acid peptide, CBO-II (50 μm), which blocks the binding of VGF165 to its receptors, was used. Cells pretreated with CBO-II inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity following VEGF165 stimulation (p < 0.001) to an extent similar to that observed in tunicamycin-treated cells. No further reduction in VEGF165-stimulated activity was observed when tunicamycin-treated cells were preincubated with CBO-II (Fig. 1B). This suggested no changes in the receptor level, but alteration in its signaling ability. VEGF-induced changes are expected to be seen in cells expressing functional VEGF receptors (26Shibuya M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells express both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 receptors although the VEGFR2 receptor has been claimed to be more effective in inducing angiogenesis. The status of total, phosphorylated VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 receptors and their ratios in capillary endothelial cells was therefore evaluated following tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) treatment. Total VEGFR1 expression was ∼97.2, ∼83.3, and ∼89.4% at 3, 12, and 32 h, respectively, over the synchronized cells, i.e. 0 h. These values for VEGFR2 were ∼110.3, ∼91.8, and ∼68.3%, respectively, for the same period. The level of phosphorylated VEGFR1 when analyzed was down-regulated by ∼30.5, ∼33.5, and ∼75.7% in cells treated with tunicamycin for 3, 12, and 32 h, respectively compared with their respective controls. The phosphorylated VEGFR2 was down-regulated by ∼44.4%, and ∼72.6% in cells treated with tunicamycin for 3 and 32 h, respectively but increased by ∼3.3% in cells treated with tunicamycin for 12 h (Fig. 1, C and D) compared with their controls. Interestingly, the reduction of phosphorylated VEGFR1 (i.e. ∼30.5%) and VEGFR2 (i.e. ∼44.4%) is serendipitously very similar to ∼46.6% reduction of protein tyrosine kinase activity following VEGF stimulation in cells treated with tunicamycin for 3 h. There was also a 1.6–2.4-fold reduction of phosphorylated VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in cells treated with tunicamycin for 32 h over that of 3 h. On the other hand, there was a 2.7–2.9-fold difference between the ratio of down-regulated phosphor-VEGF receptors (i.e. VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) and the total VEGFR 1 and VEGFR2 at 3 and 32 h of tunicamycin treatment (Table 1).TABLE 1Ratio of Phospho-VEGFRs to Total VEGFRsSamplesRatioCon-3hTM-3hCon-12hTM-12hCon-32hTM-32hPhospho-VEGFR1/Total VEGFR10.96 ± 0.090.72 ± 0.040.85 ± 0.090.53 ± 0.060.59 ± 0.060.15 ± 0.01Phospho-VEGFR2/Total VEGFR20.49 ± 0.020.36 ± 0.070.80 ± 0.060.88 ± 0.060.99 ± 0.130.26 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab To study the anti-angiogenic effect of tunicamycin in vivo, we have used the MatrigelTM plug assay in nude mice. Angiogenesis was induced by injecting MatrigelTM containing VEGF165. Intense vascularization was observed 10 days post-implantation in MatrigelTM plugs containing VEGF165. In contrast, the plugs with MatrigelTM alone appeared pale. Tunicamycin inhibited neo-vascularization, and the plugs appeared pale as well even when VEGF165 was present (Fig. 2A, right). Histological analysis of H&E-stained paraffin sections also supported an increased number of vessels in the plugs containing VEGF165, as opposed to the plugs with MatrigelTM alone. Tunicamycin treatment caused considerable reduction of neo-vascularization in the plugs containing VEGF165 (Fig. 2B). Quantitative analysis supported ∼75% reduction in the vessel density in tunicamycin-treated MatrigelTM plugs (Fig. 2B far right; p < 0.001). Microvessel density is a vital prognostic biomarker correlating the growth and development of breast cancer (27Kerbel R.S. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) and is often used to evaluate tumor growth (28Weidner N. Folkman J. Important Adv. Oncol. 1996; : 167-190PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the tunicamycin-mediated inhibition of vessel formation in MatrigelTM plugs, the microvessel density in the plugs was examined immunohistochemically after staining for CD34 and CD144. Microscopic examination revealed numerous CD34- and CD144-stained vessels in the positive control group (VEGF165 + heparin) (Fig. 2, C and D, middle), but only a few vessels in the group treated with tunicamycin (Fig. 2C, right and Fig. 2D, right). 87 ± 4.04 vessels stained for CD34 and 78 ± 3.4 vessels for CD144 in the positive control group as opposed to only 12 ± 1.2 vessels in CD34 or 8 ± 1.5 vessels in CD144 in the group treated with tunicamycin, respectively. Quantification (Fig. 2, C and D, far right) indicates ∼87.5% decrease (p < 0.001) in microvessel density because of tunicamycin treatment. Angiogenesis is a balance between the expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules (29Dass C.R. Tran T.M. Choong P.F. J. Dental Res. 2007; 86: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1) is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis (30Grossfeld G.D. Ginsberg D.A. Stein J.P. Bochner B.H. Esrig D. Groshen S. Dunn M. Nichols P.W. Taylor C.R. Skinner D.G. Cote R.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To get an insight into the tunicamycin-induced inhibition of neo-vascularization in MatrigelTM plugs, Tsp-1 gene expression was monitored in the plugs. qRT-PCR analysis reveals ∼3.8-fold (p < 0.001) up-regulation of Tsp-1 gene expression (Fig. 3A). Up-regulation of TSP-1 mRNA as well as protein was also observed in capillary endothelial cells treated with tunicamycin for 32 h (Fig. 3, B and C). In vitro cell culture and in vivo MatrigelTM implant models raised the question of whether tunicamycin could treat breast tumors. To answer, we took the following approaches: (i) orthotopic breast tumor in nude mice were developed with MDA-MB-435 (ER−/PR−/EGFR+) cells and treated with tunicamycin by intravenous injection (group a; Fig. 4A); and (ii) breast tumor xenografts in nude mice were developed with MDA-MB-231 (ER−/PR−/EGFR−) cells and treated orally with tunicamycin (group b; Fig. 5A). In group a, tunicamycin treatment was started after the tumor size reached ∼3 mm in diameter in 6 days at doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively, once a week. The results (Fig. 4A) indicated that tumor growth progressed in untreated controls and also in the group treated with a low dose of tunicamycin (i.e. 0.1 mg/kg). However, it was markedly reduced (∼56% in 23 days) when treated with 1.0 mg/kg of tunicamycin. Tumor volume regressed ∼17% at 0.5 mg/kg of tunicamycin. It is important to note that 15 times more taxol was needed to match the effect of 1 mg/kg of tunicamycin. The histogram in Fig. 4A (far right) recorded the tumor weight after each treatment and at the end of the treatment period. H&E staining of paraffin sections of the tumor tissue indicated reduced microvascular density as the tunicamycin concentrations were increased from zero to 1 mg/kg (Fig. 4, B and C). Fig. 4C (far right) recorded the mitotic index of tumor cells per 10 high power field (HPF) and explained that the mitotic index of the tumor cells declined as a consequence o"

While some black holes with masses > billion solar masses? have been detected in luminous quasars less than one billion years after the Big Bang, these individual extreme objects have limited utility in constraining the channels of formation of the earliest black holes. The initial conditions of black hole seed properties are quickly erased during the growth process. From deep, optimally stacked, archival X-ray observations, we measure the amount of black hole growth in z=6-8 galaxies (0.7-1 billion years after the Big Bang). Our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with their hosts throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. We find that most copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significant amounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highest energy X-rays. This suggests that black holes grow significantly more than previously thought during these early bursts, and due to obscuration they do not contribute to the re-ionization of the Universe with their ultraviolet emission."
https://openalex.org/W2147454918,"Although in vitro IL-4 directs CD4 T cells to produce T helper 2 (Th2)-cytokines, these cytokines can be induced in vivo in the absence of IL-4-signalling. Thus, mechanism(s), different from the in vitro pathway for Th2-induction, contribute to in vivo Th2-differentiation. The pathway for in vivo IL-4-independent Th2-differentiation has yet to be characterized.Helios (ikzf2), a member of the Ikaros transcription regulator family, is expressed in thymocytes and some antigen-matured T cells as well as in regulatory T cells. It has been proposed that Helios is a specific marker for thymus-derived regulatory T cells. Here, we show that mouse ovalbumin-specific CD4 (OTII) cells responding to alum-precipitated ovalbumin (alumOVA) upregulate Th2 features - GATA-3 and IL-4 - as well as Helios mRNA and protein. Helios is also upregulated in follicular helper T (TFh) cells in this response. By contrast, OTII cells responding to the Th1 antigen - live attenuated ovalbumin-expressing Salmonella - upregulate Th1 features - T-bet and IFN-γ - but not Helios. In addition, CD4 T cells induced to produce Th2 cytokines in vitro do not express Helios. The kinetics of Helios mRNA and protein induction mirrors that of GATA-3. The induction of IL-4, IL-13 and CXCR5 by alumOVA requires NF-κB1 and this is also needed for Helios upregulation. Importantly, Helios is induced in Th2 and TFh cells without parallel upregulation of Foxp3. These findings suggested a key role for Helios in Th2 and TFh development in response to alum-protein vaccines. We tested this possibility using Helios-deficient OTII cells and found this deficiency had no discernable impact on Th2 and TFh differentiation in response to alumOVA.Helios is selectively upregulated in CD4 T cells during Th2 and TFh responses to alum-protein vaccines in vivo, but the functional significance of this upregulation remains uncertain."

In this study, we investigated its neuroprotective effects in a chronic rotenone rat model for Parkinson's disease. Here we showed that a five-week treatment with edaravone abolished rotenone's activity to induce catalepsy, damage mitochondria and degenerate dopamine neurons in the midbrain of rotenone-treated rats. This abolishment was attributable at least partly to edaravone's inhibition of rotenone-induced reactive oxygen species production or apoptotic promoter Bax expression and its up-regulation of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) expression. Collectively, edaravone may provide novel clinical therapeutics for PD."
https://openalex.org/W2029505627,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) caused by overexpression of p-glycoprotein is a major obstacle in chemotherapy of malignant cancer, which usually is characterized by constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), but their relation between MDR and STAT3 remains unclear. Here, we showed that STAT3 was overexpressed and highly activated in adriamycin-resistant K562/A02 cells compared with its parental K562 cells. Blockade of activation of STAT3 by STAT3 decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) promoted the accumulation and increased their sensitivity to adriamycin by down-regulating transcription of mdr1 and expression of P-gp, which were further confirmed by using STAT3-specific inhibitor JSI-124. Inhibition of STAT3 could also decrease mdr1 promoter mediated luciferase expression by using mdr1 promoter luciferase reporter construct. Otherwise, activation of STAT3 by STAT3C improved mdr1 transcription and P-gp expression. The ChIP results demonstrated that STAT3 could bind to the potential promoter region of mdr1, and STAT3 decoy depressed the binding. Further mutation assay show +64∼+72 region could be the STAT3 binding site. Our data demonstrate a role of STAT3 in regulation of mdr1 gene expression in myeloid leukemia and suggest that STAT3 may be a promising therapeutic target for overcoming MDR resistance in myeloid leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2036205806,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, is associated with severe cardiac complications including cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. Recent research suggests that impaired voltage-gated ion channels in dystrophic cardiomyocytes accompany cardiac pathology. It is, however, unknown if the ion channel defects are primary effects of dystrophic gene mutations, or secondary effects of the developing cardiac pathology.To address this question, we first investigated sodium channel impairments in cardiomyocytes derived from dystrophic neonatal mice prior to cardiomyopahty development, by using the whole cell patch clamp technique. Besides the most common model for DMD, the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse, we also used mice additionally carrying an utrophin mutation. In neonatal cardiomyocytes, dystrophin-deficiency generated a 25% reduction in sodium current density. In addition, extra utrophin-deficiency significantly altered sodium channel gating parameters. Moreover, also calcium channel inactivation was considerably reduced in dystrophic neonatal cardiomyocytes, suggesting that ion channel abnormalities are universal primary effects of dystrophic gene mutations. To assess developmental changes, we also studied sodium channel impairments in cardiomyocytes derived from dystrophic adult mice, and compared them with the respective abnormalities in dystrophic neonatal cells. Here, we found a much stronger sodium current reduction in adult cardiomyocytes. The described sodium channel impairments slowed the upstroke of the action potential in adult cardiomyocytes, and only in dystrophic adult mice, the QRS interval of the electrocardiogram was prolonged.Ion channel impairments precede pathology development in the dystrophic heart, and may thus be considered potential cardiomyopathy triggers."
https://openalex.org/W2148789090,"Human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) mount a hypersumoylation response in a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent manner. The mechanism that couples JNK signaling to the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) pathway and its functional consequences are not understood. We show that ROS-dependent JNK activation converges on the SUMO pathway via PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1). Unexpectedly, PIAS1 knockdown not only prevented ROS-dependent hypersumoylation but also enhanced JNK signaling in HESCs. Conversely, PIAS overexpression increased sumoylation of various substrates, including c-Jun, yet inhibited basal and ROS-dependent JNK activity independently of its SUMO ligase function. Expression profiling demonstrated that PIAS1 knockdown enhances and profoundly modifies the transcriptional response to oxidative stress signals. Using a cutoff of 2-fold change or more, a total of 250 ROS-sensitive genes were identified, 97 of which were not dependent on PIAS1. PIAS1 knockdown abolished the regulation of 43 genes but also sensitized 110 other genes to ROS. Importantly, PIAS1 silencing was obligatory for the induction of several cellular defense genes in response to oxidative stress. In agreement, PIAS1 knockdown attenuated ROS-dependent caspase-3/7 activation and subsequent apoptosis. Thus, PIAS1 determines the level of JNK activity in HESCs, couples ROS signaling to the SUMO pathway, and promotes oxidative cell death.—Leitao, B. B., Jones, M. C., Brosens, J. J.

To understand Runx2 function requires determination of the spatiotemporal activity of P1 and P2 to Runx2 protein production. We generated a mouse model in which the P1-derived transcript was replaced with a lacZ reporter allele, resulting in loss of P1-derived protein while simultaneously allowing discrimination between the activities of the two promoters. Loss of P1-driven expression causes developmental defects with cleidocranial dysplasia-like syndromes that persist in the postnatal skeleton. P1 activity is robust in preosteogenic mesenchyme and at the onset of bone formation but decreases as bone matures. Homozygous Runx2-P1lacZ/lacZ mice have a normal life span but exhibit severe osteopenia and compromised bone repair in adult mice because of osteoblastic defects and not increased osteoclastic resorption. Gene expression profiles of bone, immunohistochemical studies, and ex vivo differentiation using calvarial osteoblasts and marrow stromal cells identified mechanisms for the skeletal phenotype. The findings indicate that P1 promoter activity is necessary for generating a threshold level of Runx2 protein to commit sufficient osteoprogenitor numbers for normal bone formation. P1 promoter function is not compensated via the P2 promoter. However, the P2 transcript with compensatory mechanisms from bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling is adequate for mineralization of the bone tissue that does form.

https://openalex.org/W2067397214,"Seasonal variation in serum concentration of the vitamin D metabolite 25(OH) vitamin D [25(OH)D], which contributes to host immune function, has been hypothesized to be the underlying source of observed influenza seasonality in temperate regions. The objective of this study was to determine whether observed 25(OH)D levels could be used to simulate observed influenza infection rates. Data of mean and variance in 25(OH)D serum levels by month were obtained from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and used to parameterize an individual-based model of influenza transmission dynamics in two regions of the United States. Simulations were compared with observed daily influenza excess mortality data. Best-fitting simulations could reproduce the observed seasonal cycle of influenza; however, these best-fit simulations were shown to be highly sensitive to stochastic processes within the model and were unable consistently to reproduce observed seasonal patterns. In this respect the simulations with the vitamin D forced model were inferior to similar modeling efforts using absolute humidity and the school calendar as seasonal forcing variables. These model results indicate it is unlikely that seasonal variations in vitamin D levels principally determine the seasonality of influenza in temperate regions."

Here, we explored how gambling decisions, their psychophysiological and neural counterparts are modulated by an induced sense of urgency to respond. Urgency influenced decision times and evoked heart rate responses, interacting with the expected value of each gamble. Using functional MRI, we observed that this interaction was associated with changes in the activity of the striatum, a critical region for both reward and choice selection, and within the insula, a region implicated as the substrate of affective feelings arising from interoceptive signals which influence motivational behavior. Our findings bridge current psychophysiological and neurobiological models of value representation and action-programming, identifying the striatum and insular cortex as the key substrates of decision-making under risk and urgency."

Similar to all saposin-like proteins, the plant-specific insert functions via protein-membrane interactions; however, the structural basis for such interactions has not been studied, and the nature of plant-specific insert-mediated membrane disruption has not been characterized. In the present study, the crystal structure of the saposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease was resolved at a resolution of 1.9 Å, revealing an open V-shaped configuration similar to the open structure of human saposin C. Notably, vesicle disruption activity followed Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics, a finding not previously reported for saposin-like proteins including plant-specific inserts. Circular dichroism data suggested that secondary structure was pH-dependent in a fashion similar to influenza A hemagglutinin fusion peptide. Membrane effects characterized by atomic force microscopy and light scattering indicated bilayer solubilization as well as fusogenic activity. Taken together, the present study is the first report to elucidate the membrane interaction mechanism of plant saposin-like domains whereby pH-dependent membrane interactions resulted in bilayer fusogenic activity that probably arose from a viral type pH-dependent helix-kink-helix motif at the plant-specific insert N terminus."

We previously identified Nkx2.5 as a target of sumoylation, a posttranslational modification implicated in a variety of cellular activities. Sumoylation enhanced Nkx2.5 activity via covalent attachment to the lysine residue 51, the primary SUMO acceptor site. However, how sumoylation regulates the activity of Nkx2.5 in vivo remains unknown. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing sumoylation deficient mutant K51R (conversion of lysine 51 to arginine) specifically in mouse hearts under the control of cardiac α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter (K51R-Tg). Expression of the Nkx2.5 mutant transgene in the wild type murine hearts did not result in any overt cardiac phenotype. However, in the presence of Nkx2.5 haploinsufficiency, cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the Nkx2.5 K51R mutant led to congenital heart diseases (CHDs), accompanied with decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation. Also, a number of human CHDs-associated Nkx2.5 mutants exhibited aberrant sumoylation. Our work demonstrates that altered sumoylation status may underlie the development of human CHDs associated with Nkx2.5 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1966398068,"B cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of both systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Autoreactive B cells not only produce autoantibodies, but also are capable to efficiently present specific autoantigens to T cells. Furthermore, B cells can secrete proinflammatory cytokines and amplify the vicious process of self-destruction. B cell-directed therapy is a potentially important approach for treatment of various autoimmune diseases. The depletion of B cells by anti-CD20/19 monoclonal antibody Retuximab® used in autoimmune diseases therapy leads to systemic side effects and should be significantly improved. In this study we designed a repertoire of genetically engineered B cell killers that specifically affected one kind of cells carrying a respective B cell receptor. We constructed immunotoxins (ITs), fused with c-myc epitope as a model targeting sequence, based on barnase, Pseudomonas toxin, Shiga-like toxin E.coli and Fc domain of human antibody IgGγ1. C-MYC hybridoma cell line producing anti-c-myc IgG was chosen as a model for targeted cell depletion. C-myc sequence fused with toxins provided addressed delivery of the toxic agent to the target cells. We demonstrated functional activity of designed ITs in vitro and showed recognition of the fusion molecules by antibodies produced by targeted hybridoma. To study specificity of the proposed B cells killing molecules, we tested a set of created ITs ex vivo, using C-MYC and irrelevant hybridoma cell lines. Pseudomonas-containing IT showed one of the highest cytotoxic effects on the model cells, however, possessed promiscuous specificity. Shiga-like toxin construct demonstrated mild both cytotoxicity and specificity. Barnase and Fc-containing ITs revealed excellent balance between their legibility and toxic properties. Moreover, barnase and Fc molecules fused with c-myc epitope were able to selectively deplete c-myc-specific B cells and decrease production of anti-c-myc antibodies in culture of native splenocytes, suggesting their highest therapeutic potential as targeted B cell killing agents."
https://openalex.org/W1973605117,"The ∼2-megadalton evolutionarily conserved histone deacetylase-associated Rpd3L/Sin3L complex plays critical roles in altering the histone code and repressing transcription of a broad range of genes involved in many aspects of cellular physiology. Targeting of this complex to specific regions of the genome is presumed to rely on interactions involving one or more of at least 10 distinct subunits in the complex. Here we describe the solution structure of the complex formed by the interacting domains of two constitutively associated subunits, mSin3A and SAP30. The mSin3A paired amphipathic helix 3 (PAH3) domain in the complex adopts the left-handed four-helix bundle structure characteristic of PAH domains. The SAP30 Sin3 interaction domain (SID) binds to PAH3 via a tripartite structural motif, including a C-terminal helix that targets the canonical PAH hydrophobic cleft while two other helices and an N-terminal extension target a discrete surface formed largely by the PAH3 α2, α3, and α3' helices. The protein-protein interface is extensive (∼1400 Å(2)), accounting for the high affinity of the interaction and the constitutive association of the SAP30 subunit with the Rpd3L/Sin3L complex. We further show using NMR that the mSin3A PAH3-SAP30 SID complex can bind to nucleic acids, hinting at a role for a nucleolar localization sequence in the SID αA helix in targeting the Rpd3L/Sin3L complex for silencing ribosomal RNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W2001088595,"The LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a large endocytic receptor that controls macrophage migration in part by interacting with β(2) integrin receptors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying LRP1 integrin recognition is poorly understood. Here, we report that LRP1 specifically recognizes α(M)β(2) but not its homologous receptor α(L)β(2). The interaction between these two cellular receptors in macrophages is significantly enhanced upon α(M)β(2) activation by LPS and is mediated by multiple regions in both LRP1 and α(M)β(2). Specifically, we find that both the heavy and light chains of LRP1 are involved in α(M)β(2) binding. Within the heavy chain, the binding is mediated primarily via the second and fourth ligand binding repeats. For α(M)β(2), we find that the α(M)-I domain represents a major LRP1 recognition site. Indeed, substitution of the I domain of the α(L)β(2) receptor with that of α(M) confers the α(L)β(2) receptor with the ability to interact with LRP1. Furthermore, we show that residues (160)EQLKKSKTL(170) within the α(M)-I domain represent a major LRP1 recognition site. Given that perturbation of this specific sequence leads to altered adhesive activity of α(M)β(2), our finding suggests that binding of LRP1 to α(M)β(2) could alter integrin function. Indeed, we further demonstrate that the soluble form of LRP1 (sLRP1) inhibits α(M)β(2)-mediated adhesion of cells to fibrinogen. These studies suggest that sLRP1 may attenuate inflammation by modulating integrin function."

Male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After 2-D DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, 79 differentially expressed proteins between the control and the PFDoA treated rats (0.2 and 0.5 mg-dosed groups) were successfully identified. These proteins were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, electron transport, and stress response. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic analysis showed an increase in pyruvate, lactate, acetate, choline, and a variety of amino acids in the highest dose group. Furthermore, the profiles of free amino acids in the PFDoA treated groups were investigated quantitatively by high-coverage quantitative iTRAQ-LC MS/MS, which showed levels of sarcosine, asparagine, histidine, 1-methylhistidine, Ile, Leu, Val, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Cys, and Met increased markedly in the 0.5 mg dosed group, while homocitrulline, α-aminoadipic acid, β-alanine, and cystathionine decreased. Conclusion/Significance These observations provide evidence that disorders in glucose and amino acid metabolism may contribute to PFDoA nephrotoxicity. Additionally, α2u globulin may play an important role in protecting the kidneys from PFDoA toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1965031127,"The production of type I interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infections is critical for antiviral immunity. However, IFN production is transient, and continued expression can lead to inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying the negative regulation of IFN expression could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of these diseases. We report that the transcription factor IRF3 plays a central role in the negative regulation of interferon-β (IFNβ) expression during both acute and persistent (chronic) virus infections. We show that the degradation of IRF3 during acute infections, rather than the activation of transcriptional repressors, leads to the down regulation of IFNβ expression. We also show that the block to IFNβ expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are persistently infected with Sendai virus (SeV) correlates with the absence of transcriptionally active IRF3. Remarkably, ongoing protein synthesis and viral replication are required to maintain repression of the IFNβ gene in persistently infected cells, as the gene can be activated by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, or by the antiviral drug ribavirin. Finally, we show that the SeV V protein inhibits IRF3 activity in persistently infected cells. Thus, in conjunction with the known interference with STAT1 by the SeV C protein, both IFN activation and its signaling pathways are blocked in persistently infected cells. We conclude that the transcription factor IRF3 is targeted for turnover and inactivation through distinct mechanisms from both the host cells and virus, leading to the inhibition of IFNβ gene expression during acute and persistent viral infections. These observations show that IRF3 plays a critical role, not only in the activation of the IFNβ gene, but also in the controlling the duration of its expression. (284 words)"
https://openalex.org/W2094771235,"Background Local HIV epidemiology data are critical in determining the suitability of a population for HIV vaccine efficacy trials. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of, and determine risk factors for HIV transmission in a rural community-based HIV vaccine preparedness cohort in Masaka, Uganda. Methods Between February and July 2004, we conducted a house-to-house HIV sero-prevalence survey among consenting individuals aged 18–60 years. Participants were interviewed, counseled and asked to provide blood for HIV testing. We then enrolled the HIV uninfected participants in a 2-year HIV sero-incidence study. Medical evaluations, HIV counseling and testing, and sample collection for laboratory analysis were done quarterly. Sexual risk behaviour data was collected every 6 months. Results The HIV point prevalence was 11.2%, and was higher among women than men (12.9% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.007). Risk factors associated with prevalent HIV infection for men were age <25 years (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01–0.35) and reported genital ulcer disease in the past year (aOR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.23–3.83). Among women, being unmarried (aOR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.75–3.83) and reported genital ulcer disease in the past year (aOR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.64–3.51) were associated with prevalent HIV infection. Twenty-one seroconversions were recorded over 2025.8 person-years, an annual HIV incidence of 1.04% (95% CI: 0.68–1.59). The only significant risk factor for incident HIV infection was being unmarried (aRR = 3.44, 95% CI 1.43–8.28). Cohort retention after 2 years was 87%. Conclusions We found a high prevalence but low incidence of HIV in this cohort. HIV vaccine efficacy trials in this population may not be feasible due to the large sample sizes that would be required. HIV vaccine preparatory efforts in this setting should include identification of higher risk populations."

https://openalex.org/W2066825192,"N-Glycosylation of membrane proteins is critical for their proper folding, co-assembly and subsequent matriculation through the secretory pathway. Here, we examine the kinetics of N-glycan addition to type I transmembrane KCNE1 K(+) channel β-subunits, where point mutations that prevent N-glycosylation at one consensus site give rise to disorders of the cardiac rhythm and congenital deafness. We show that KCNE1 has two distinct N-glycosylation sites: a typical co-translational site and a consensus site ∼20 residues away that unexpectedly acquires N-glycans after protein synthesis (post-translational). Mutations that ablate the co-translational site concomitantly reduce glycosylation at the post-translational site, resulting in unglycosylated KCNE1 subunits that cannot reach the cell surface with their cognate K(+) channel. This long range inhibition is highly specific for post-translational N-glycosylation because mutagenic conversion of the KCNE1 post-translational site into a co-translational site restored both monoglycosylation and anterograde trafficking. These results directly explain how a single point mutation can prevent N-glycan attachment at multiple sites, providing a new biogenic mechanism for human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2084978643,"Uronate dehydrogenase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AtUdh) belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily and catalyzes the oxidation of d-galacturonic acid and d-glucuronic acid with NAD+ as a cofactor. We have determined the crystal structures of an apo-form of AtUdh, a ternary form in complex with NADH and product (substrate-soaked structure), and an inactive Y136A mutant in complex with NAD+. The crystal structures suggest AtUdh to be a homohexamer, which has also been observed to be the major form in solution. The monomer contains a Rossmann fold, essential for nucleotide binding and a common feature of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family enzymes. The ternary complex structure reveals a product, d-galactaro-1,5-lactone, which is bound above the nicotinamide ring. This product rearranges in solution to d-galactaro-1,4-lactone as verified by mass spectrometry analysis, which agrees with our previous NMR study. The crystal structure of the mutant with the catalytic residue Tyr-136 substituted with alanine shows changes in the position of Ile-74 and Ser-75. This probably altered the binding of the nicotinamide end of NAD+, which was not visible in the electron density map.

This information can be applied to the design of efficient microbial conversion of d-galacturonic acid-based waste materials. d-Galacturonic acid is the main component of pectin, a natural polymer that exists in primary cell walls of terrestrial plants. Citrus peel and sugar beet pulp are cheap raw materials, and both contain a large amount of pectin, which is currently exploited mainly as cattle feed. Pectin has the potential to be an important raw material for biotechnical conversions to fuels and chemicals. The microbial pathways of d-galacturonic acid catabolism have recently been described (1Richard P. Hilditch S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2009; 82: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two different catabolic pathways, the isomerase pathway and the oxidative pathway, have been found in bacteria. The isomerase pathway (in Escherichia coli) converts d-galacturonic acid into pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The oxidative pathway has been described for Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas syringae (2Zajic J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1959; 78: 734-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kilgore W.W. Starr M.P. Nature. 1959; 183: 1412-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this pathway, d-galacturonic acid is first oxidized into meso-galactaric acid and then converted in the following step to α-ketoglutarate. Uronate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.203) is the key enzyme in the oxidative pathway of d-galacturonic acid catabolism in bacteria. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of d-galacturonic acid into d-galactaric acid. Uronate dehydrogenases from A. tumefaciens (4Chang Y.F. Feingold D.S. J.

A. tumefaciens (Rhizobium radiobacter) uronate dehydrogenase (AtUdh) 2The abbreviations used are: AtUdhA. tumefaciens uronate dehydrogenaseSDRshort-chain dehydrogenase/reductaseDesIVdTDP-glucose 4,5-dehydratase. is specific for NAD+ as a cofactor but accepts both d-galacturonic acid and d-glucuronic acid as substrates with similar affinities. AtUdh belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. SDR proteins are NAD(P)(H)-dependent enzymes with a wide spectrum of substrate specificities and also different enzyme classes (21Kavanagh K.L. Jörnvall H. Persson B. Oppermann U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3895-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The sequence identities between the members of the SDR family are low, but they share a similar three-dimensional α/β-structure. A. tumefaciens uronate dehydrogenase short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase dTDP-glucose 4,5-dehydratase. To date, no structural information on uronate dehydrogenase is available. Here, we present the first three-dimensional structure of uronate dehydrogenase, namely AtUdh. We determined the crystal structures of AtUdh in the apo-form and the ternary complex with NADH and product at 1.9 and 2.1 Å resolutions, respectively. In addition, we performed a site-directed mutagenesis study of the catalytic residue Tyr-136 and determined the NAD+-bound crystal structure of the inactive mutant Y136A. This crystallographic information has enabled us to identify the active site of the enzyme and the molecular basis for cofactor and substrate recognition. We also propose a structure-based mechanism for the oxidation of d-galacturonic acid. This information can be used to improve the properties of the enzyme, especially the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity. Cloning, expression, and purification were performed as described previously (6Boer H. Maaheimo H. Koivula A. Penttilä M. Richard P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the N-terminal His6-tagged gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the constitutive triose-phosphate isomerase promoter, and AtUdh was purified from the yeast cell extract in a single step using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. The His6-tagged uronate dehydrogenase gene in the p2159 vector (6Boer H. Maaheimo H. Koivula A. Penttilä M. Richard P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used as the template for all mutagenesis reactions. A site-directed mutation of tyrosine at position 136 to alanine was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The mutant was transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain, isolated, and sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Expression and purification of the His6-tagged Y136A mutant were carried out in S. cerevisiae using essentially the same protocol as for the wild-type enzyme. The activity of the purified mutant enzyme was assayed on d-galacturonic acid at pH 7.5 and 2 °C by following the formation of NADH at 340 nm as described (6Boer H. Maaheimo H. Koivula A. Penttilä M. Richard P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The effect of sulfate on AtUdh activity was determined by following the change in absorbance at 340 nm in the presence of 1 μm to 100 mm ammonium sulfate at 22 °C. In the assay, 1 μg of AtUdh was used with 4 mm d-galacturonic acid and 0.5 mm NAD+ in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2. Size-exclusion chromatography to analyze the oligomeric state of the AtUdh was performed at 22 °C on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with gel filtration standard proteins (GE Healthcare) giving the following elution volumes: ferritin (440,000 Da), 14.3 ml; aldolase (158,000 Da), 15.3 ml; ovalbumin (44,000 Da), 16.5 ml; and ribonuclease A (13,700 Da), 18.0 ml. The void volume of the column was determined by thyroglobulin, which eluted at 8.5 ml. A 250-μl sample containing 29 μg of AtUdh was loaded onto the column, and the eluate was monitored at 280 nm. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and aliquots from the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electrospray ionization MS was performed on a quadrupole ion trap instrument (Esquire 3000 Plus, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) operated in a negative-ion mode. This instrument has been described in detail previously (8Pasanen S. Jänis J. Vainiotalo P. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 263: 22-29Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). d-Galacturonic acid was dissolved in water to prepare a 100 mm stock solution. For electrospray ionization MS, the stock solution was further diluted to 10 μm with acetonitrile and directly electrosprayed at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. For hydrogen/deuterium exchange, the stock solution was first diluted to 100 μm with D2O, allowed to stand for 15 min, and further diluted to 10 μm with acetonitrile-d3. For collision-induced dissociation MS/MS spectra, the ions of interest were mass-selected and fragmented using the most appropriate fragmentation amplitudes. For reaction end product analysis, a mixture of 100 μm d-galacturonic acid and 180 μm NAD+ was prepared in 1 ml of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.3), and 2 μl of AtUdh (4 mg/ml) was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by diluting the reaction mixture with acetonitrile (1:10) and directly analyzed. For hydrogen/deuterium exchange, 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate prepared in D2O was used instead. The instrument was controlled and the data were processed using Bruker Daltonics Compass 1.1 for Esquire/HCT software. The spectra were further analyzed with Bruker DataAnalysis 4.0 software. All crystallization experiments were performed at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The protein concentration was 4 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 0.5 ml of reservoir solution. Crystal screening was carried out using Crystal ScreenTM (Hampton Research). The first crystallization condition consisted of 2.0 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6). To optimize the size of the crystals, the concentration of ammonium sulfate was decreased to 1.8 m. Under this condition, crystals 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm in size grew within a few days. These crystals were used for crystal structure determination and for the apo-structure. For the soaking experiments, a second crystallization condition was optimized because only half of the NAD+ molecule was observed in the cofactor-binding site in the first crystals. The second crystallization condition consisted of 1.8 m ammonium phosphate and Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and the crystals were isomorphous with the crystals obtained earlier. These latter conditions were also used for crystallization of the Y136A mutant. The heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals in cryoprotectant solution (reservoir solution containing 30% glycerol) containing 10 mm heavy atom for 10 min. For the soaking of crystals, 5 mm NAD+ and 10 mm d-galacturonic acid was added to the reservoir solution. Crystals were soaked for ∼10 min and transferred to cryoprotectant solution containing soaking solution with an additional 30% of glycerol. After a quick soak in cryoprotectant solution, the crystals were cooled in liquid nitrogen. All crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen after being soaked in cryoprotectant solution, and the data were collected at 100 K. European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamlines ID14-4 and ID23-1 and DESY beamline X12 were used as x-ray sources. All data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the program package XDS/XSCALE (9Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11222) Google Scholar). The apo-crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.9 Å. The crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6222 (a and b = 164.6 Å and c = 174.8 Å), with a solvent content of 68% and three molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of AtUdh was solved by the SIRAS (single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering) method using the HKL2MAP graphical user interface (10Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl.Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar). Native and derivative data sets were scaled together with SHELXC, and the heavy atom positions were determined by using SHELXD (11Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80546) Google Scholar). SHELXE was then used to compute the protein phases using a KAu(CN)2 derivative crystal. The resultant electron density map was used to automatically fit the sequence using Buccaneer (12Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 1002-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar), which built a total of 796 residues for the three molecules. The remainder of the model was manually built with COOT (13Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23218) Google Scholar), and the refinement was subsequently performed with PHENIX (14Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G.

The structures of AtUdh soaked with NAD+ and d-galacturonic acid at pH 8.5 and the Y136A mutant soaked with NAD+ were solved by molecular replacement using the apo-structure as an initial model. Model building was carried out with COOT, and the refinement was performed with PHENIX. The validation of the models was performed with PROCHECK (15Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. The protein crystals of AtUdh belong to the space group P6222. There are three AtUdh monomers in the asymmetric unit, and the Matthews coefficient (16Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar) is 3.8 Å3/Da, which corresponds to an estimated solvent content of 68%. The apo-structure of AtUdh was solved by x-ray crystallography at 1.9 Å resolution and phased by the SIRAS method with a gold derivative. The final model consists of 813 residues and 876 water molecules. The apo-structure was refined to an R-factor of 15% and a Rfree value of 17%. The root mean square differences between the monomers are ∼0.2 Å. The complex structure with NADH and product was determined by soaking the crystals with a substrate, d-galacturonic acid, and a cofactor, NAD+. The resolution of the structure is 2.1 Å, the R-factor is 15.7%, and the Rfree value is 18.9%. The Y136A mutant complexed with NAD+ was refined to 1.9 Å with an R-factor of 16.1% and an Rfree value of 18.6%. The root mean square differences between the molecules and models are ∼0.2 Å. The AtUdh monomer is a single-domain protein consisting of seven β-strands and seven α-helices. The structure of AtUdh contains a Rossmann fold motif with a parallel seven-stranded β-sheet (β1–β7) surrounded by five α-helices (α2, α3, and α4 on one side and α1 and α6 on the other side). The cofactor is bound in a crevice at the C-terminal side of the β-sheet between β1 and β4, in which the strand order is reversed. Two shorter α-helices (α5 and α7) are located away from the main domain body and constitute parts of the substrate-binding cleft. The secondary structure elements of AtUdh are shown in Fig. 1A. Analysis of the crystal structure of AtUdh with the PISA server (17Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6766) Google Scholar) suggests that the enzyme forms a hexamer with a total interface area of ∼7450 Å2. Two monomers form a tightly packed dimer (interface area of 1400 Å2), and there is a 2-fold symmetry axis between these monomers. Helices α3 and α4 from both monomers are packed together to form a four-helical bundle (Fig. 1B). Three of these dimers are then more loosely packed together around a 3-fold symmetry axis, perpendicular to the symmetry axes between the tight dimers (Fig. 1, B and C). This packing results in a total of six monomer-monomer interfaces of 540 Å2. AtUdh was also found to be a hexamer in solution, as analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering (data not shown). AtUdh contains six free cysteine residues, which do not form disulfide bridges, typical for a cytosolic enzyme. Cys-65, Cys-166, and Cys-200 are embedded in the hydrophobic environment in the protein interior. The side chain of Cys-141 is on the protein surface but located on the monomer-monomer interface. Cys-47 and Cys-50, located in the β3-strand, extend to the protein outer surface and may be theoretically capable of making intermolecular disulfide bridges in an oxidative environment. In the electron density maps of the ternary complex of AtUdh, clear electron density was observed at the expected dinucleotide-binding site, which allowed an unambiguous fit of NADH with the electron density (Fig. 1D). All of the residues and solvent molecules that directly interact with NADH were identified (Fig. 2B). The bound NADH is located at the C-terminal edge of the β-sheet in an extended conformation. The adenine ring is positioned in an anti-conformation, the nicotinamide ring moiety is in a syn-conformation, and both riboses of the NADH adopt an C2-endo-conformation. The adenine ring of NADH interacts with the enzyme via hydrophobic interactions with Leu-35 and Leu-52 and a hydrogen bond between the adenine amino group and the Asp-51 carboxyl group. The 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose form hydrogen bonds with Asp-34. In addition, there is a hydrogen bond between the 2′-hydroxyl group and Ser-36. The presence of Asp-34 explains especially well why AtUdh does not accept NADP+ as a cofactor, as the negatively charged phosphate at the 2′-position would repel a negatively charged carboxyl group of Asp-34. The pyrophosphate moiety is hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain atoms of Gln-14 and Leu-15 and to the side chain of Ser-75. The 3′-hydroxyl group of the nicotinamide ribose is hydrogen-bonded to Lys-140, and the 2′-hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-136. The nicotinamide ring has hydrophobic interactions with Ile-163, and the oxygen of the amide group forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain nitrogen of Cys-166. The refinement of the AtUdh apo-structure showed in the active site the electron density of a sulfate ion, which was used in crystallization (Fig. 2A). The oxygen atoms of the sulfate make hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asn-112, His-113, Ser-165, and Arg-174. The sulfate was shown to inhibit AtUdh with an IC50 of ∼40 mm. Consequently, new crystallization conditions with ammonium phosphate were used instead. The soaking of AtUdh crystals with NAD+ and d-galacturonic acid resulted in a crystal structure that showed an electron density ring in the active site close to the nicotinamide ring of the NADH. This density was interpreted as the reaction product d-galactaro-1,5-lactone (Fig. 1D). The lactone ring stacks with the nicotinamide ring. The acid group of the lactone occupies the same position as the sulfate ion in the AtUdh apo-structure, and it is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Arg-174. The O1 carbonyl oxygen of the lactone is hydrogen-bonded to Tyr-136 and Ser-111, and the O2 hydroxyl is bonded to the main-chain oxygen of Ser-75. The distance between the reactive C1 of the carbohydrate and nicotinamide C4 is 3.4 Å. As a result of this, the two molecules are very well placed for the hydride transfer. A putative proton acceptor, Tyr-136 was substituted with alanine to trap the substrate or a reaction intermediate in the crystal in the presence of NAD+ and the substrate d-galacturonic acid. The activity of the purified Y136A mutant on d-galacturonic acid was ∼0.1% of the activity of wild-type AtUdh. The consequences of the mutation were also clearly visible in the electron density map. Surprisingly, there was no clear electron density for the substrate carbohydrate or for the nicotinamide residue of the NAD+ cofactor. However, electron density was visible for the adenine and both phosphates of NAD+ (Fig. 1E). The nicotinamide residue probably had multiple conformations because the electron density continues in several directions. Comparison of the mutant structure with the apo-structure and the ternary structure revealed an ∼1.5-Å shift in the positions of Ile-74 and Ser-75 toward the nicotinamide ribosyl ring of NAD+. This may have restricted the binding of the nicotinamide end of the nucleotide and reduced enzymatic activity (Fig. 2D). Negative-ion electrospray ionization MS was used to analyze end product(s) of the oxidation reaction (supplemental Fig. S1). The mass spectrum of the starting compound, d-galacturonic acid (194 Da), showed an intense peak at m/z 193, corresponding to the [M − H]− ion. After hydrogen/deuterium exchange, the peak was observed at m/z 197 instead (data not shown), consistent with the exchange of four hydrogens (accounting for four OH groups). The collision-induced dissociation MS/MS spectrum of d-galacturonic acid showed a plethora of fragments. Two consecutive water losses (ions at m/z 175 and 157) were observed with the [M − H]− ion. Alternatively, decarboxylation (elimination of CO2) was observed (m/z 149), which is highly characteristic for carboxylic acid anions, followed by two water losses (m/z 131 and 113) or loss of H2CO (m/z 119) or CH2(OH)CHO (m/z 89). The mass spectrum of the reaction product(s) showed an intense peak at m/z 191 as well as a few other peaks that were identified as the impurities of the enzyme solution (supplemental Fig. S1, marked with asterisks). After hydrogen/deuterium exchange, the peak was observed at m/z 194 instead. These results are consistent with the formation of d-galactarolactone (192 Da), having three OH groups in the structure. The MS/MS spectrum of the reaction product showed a very intense peak at m/z 85 and less abundant fragment ions at m/z 173, 147, 129, and 111. This can be explained by decarboxylation (m/z 147), followed by a water loss (m/z 129) and a second decarboxylation (m/z 85). Inspection of the putative ion structures for the deprotonated d-galacturonic acid indicates that the fragmentation proceeds without ring opening (forming a stable cyclic carbanion structure, from which water eliminations can occur). In contrast, for the deprotonated d-galactarolactone (five-membered ring), the first decarboxylation results in the immediate ring opening, followed by water elimination and a second decarboxylation. This results in a fully conjugated, resonance-stabilized ion at m/z 85. This is in line with the formation of a 1,4-lactone ring. In the case of a 1,5-lactone (six-membered ring), the first decarboxylation would result in the carbanion structure, similar to the ion at m/z 149, from which the ring opening cannot directly occur without rearrangement (e.g. hydride shift). Given the high abundance of the ion at m/z 85, it is evident that the more stable reaction product is d-galactaro-1,4-lactone. However, the initial reaction product is 1,5-lactone, as evidenced by crystallographic results. No other reaction products were detected. The ternary crystal structure clearly suggests that the binding of the NAD+ cofactor is a prerequisite for substrate binding because it participates in the formation of a ligand-binding site (Fig. 2F). The structure also shows that AtUdh is able to bind substrates in a pyranose form, i.e. as a cyclic six-membered ring. The specific activity of AtUdh has been studied recently by Yoon et al. (7Yoon S.H. Moon T.S. Iranpour P. Lanza A.M. Prather K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and more extensively by Boer et al. (6Boer H. Maaheimo H. Koivula A. Penttilä M. Richard P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) These results are in good agreement with the crystal structures. AtUdh accepts both d-glucuronic acid and d-galacturonic acid as substrates. These sugar acids have a difference in the position of O4 hydroxyl group. According to the complex structure, the axial O4 hydroxyl group of d-galacturonic acid is toward a solvent and does not form any hydrogen bonds, and there would be space for the O4 hydroxyl group in an equatorial position (Fig. 2F). d-Galactose, d-glucose, d-galactonic acid, and d-gluconic acid are not substrates for AtUdh (6Boer H. Maaheimo H. Koivula A. Penttilä M. Richard P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All of these compounds lack the carboxyl group at C6, which suggests that interaction of the carboxyl group with Arg-174 is essential for substrate binding. The SDR family is one of the largest enzyme families (18Persson B. Kallberg Y. Bray J.E. Bruford E. Dellaporta S.L. Favia A.D. Duarte R.G. Jörnvall H. Kavanagh K.L. Kedishvili N. Kisiela M. Maser E. Mindnich R. Orchard S. Penning T.M. Thornton J.M. Adamski J. Oppermann U. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2009; 178: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, there are only a few distantly related structures in the Protein Data Bank. Only dTDP-glucose 4,5-dehydratase (DesIV) from Streptomyces venezuelae shows some amino acid sequence identity (18%) to AtUdh (19Allard S.T. Cleland W.W. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2211-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DesIV catalyzes a much more complicated reaction by oxidizing the 4′-hydroxyl group and by removing the 6′-hydroxyl group of the dUTP-glucose substrate. DesIV is a 55-residue larger protein than AtUdh. The NAD+-binding section is similar, but there are large differences in the structure, especially in the C-terminal region. The wild-type DesIV complex structure with NAD+ and substrate does not show the electron density for glucose, whereas the inactive double mutant (D128N/E129Q) does. Superimposition of the cofactor- and substrate-binding sites of AtUdh and DesIV is shown in Fig. 2E. Despite large differences in the overall protein structures, especially in the loops, the binding modes for the cofactor and carbohydrates resemble each other. The reaction catalyzed by AtUdh has been studied by NMR (6Boer H. Maaheimo H. Koivula A. Penttilä M. Richard P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The β-anomeric form of d-galacturonic acid was first consumed faster than the α-anomer. This is explained nicely by the ternary complex structure, which would suggest that the O1 hydroxyl group of α-d-galacturonic acid would clash with the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. Consequently, AtUdh would accept only β-d-galacturonic acid as a substrate. This is further formed in solution from α-d-galacturonic acid by mutarotation. NMR analysis also suggested that the reaction product would be d-galactaro-1,4-lactone (five-membered ring) and not d-galactaro-1,5-lactone (six-membered ring), as observed in the ternary complex structure. There was also a small amount of meso-galactarate in solution. This is in line with the observations made by electrospray ionization MS in this study. It is reasonable to assume that the reaction product d-galactaro-1,5-lactone rearranges non-enzymatically to d-galactaro-1,4-lactone, possibly via an open-chain meso-galactaric acid form (Fig. 3). Similar non-enzymatic 1,4-lactone formation has been observed previously for d-galactose dehydrogenases (20Ueberschär K.H. Blachnitzky E.O. Kurz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 389-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because the rearrangement is an equilibrium reaction, a very small amount of d-galactaro-1,5-lactone exists in solution and explains why this form was observed in the ternary complex crystal structure. The catalytic mechanism of the dehydrogenase activity of the SDR family enzymes has been extensively discussed in light of structural, enzymological, and mutational data. It has been suggested that there would be a catalytic triad (Ser, Tyr, and Lys) or even a catalytic tetrad (Ser, Tyr, Leu, and Asn) and a proton relay system for SDRs (21Kavanagh K.L. Jörnvall H. Persson B. Oppermann U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3895-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A classical proposed reaction mechanism for this enzyme family includes a transition state in which several bonds form and break at the same time (22Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). However, to describe the reaction as a “single-barrier” process might be an oversimplification. Rather, it could be considered as a non-concerted or a stepwise reaction. Therefore, it is important to consider which is the first step. Proton donation from the O1 hydroxyl group to the catalytic tyrosine would create a negatively charged oxyanion, which would have high energy (verified normally by high pKa values of hydroxyl groups). This kind of initiation has been proposed recently by Yasutake et al. (23Yasutake Y. Nishiya Y. Tamura N. Tamura T. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hydride shift from C1 to NAD+ would lead to the resonance-stabilized cationic intermediate. This intermediate would eagerly donate a proton to the neighboring group, in this case to Tyr-136, which in AtUdh is an unusually short distance (2.5 Å) from the carbonyl oxygen of the product (Fig. 2F). AtUdh could efficiently catalyze the reaction containing a cationic intermediate through the nicotinamide ring, which packs against the substrate (Fig. 2F). The catalytic triad or tetrad hypothesis emphasizes the role of four residues in proton transfer (21Kavanagh K.L. Jörnvall H. Persson B. Oppermann U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3895-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 22Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). They all are present in AtUdh (Asn-87, Ser-111, Tyr-136, and Lys-140). Ser-111, and Tyr-136 are evidently essential residues in catalysis. Based on modeling studies, a lysine residue has been suggested to be part of a proton relay system from the phenolic oxygen of tyrosine to the 2′-hydroxyl group of ribosyl to this lysine (22Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). However, in AtUdh, Lys-140 is not hydrogen-bonded to the 2′-hydroxyl group but to the 3′-hydroxyl group of ribosyl (Fig. 2B). Also, in the DesIV structure, the corresponding lysine is hydrogen-bonded to the 3′-hydroxyl group (Fig. 2E). Therefore, the major function of lysine may be participation in NAD+ binding, and the reason for conservation of asparagine in SDR structures may be mainly structural. If the first step in the catalysis of AtUdh is the hydride shift to NAD+ and formation of a cationic intermediate, the participation of residues in proton abstraction might not be so critical. This might be reflected in the response in enzymatic activity to changes in pH. AtUdh has a high activity at pH 5–8, and the activity falls to 70% at pH 10 (7Yoon S.H. Moon T.S. Iranpour P. Lanza A.M. Prather K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If the proton abstraction from the substrate would be the key event, we could expect higher activity at high pH, which is not the case. Overall, it is difficult to specify the role of individual residues because they may have several indistinguishable roles in protein structure, ligand binding, and catalysis. The Y136A mutant structure shows how unpredictable the consequences of one mutation can be. We tried to mutate the key catalytic residue, but this resulted in unexpected structural changes that affected cofactor binding.

HSCR is a congenital complex genetic disorder characterised by a lack of enteric ganglia along a variable length of the intestine. The receptor tyrosine kinase gene (RET) is the major HSCR gene and its expression is crucial for ENS development. We have previously reported that (i) HOXB5 transcription factor mediates RET expression, and (ii) mouse with defective HOXB5 activity develop HSCR phenotype. In this study, we (i) elucidate the underlying mechanisms that HOXB5 mediate RET expression, and (ii) examine the interactions between HOXB5 and other transcription factors implicated in RET expression. We show that human HOXB5 binds to the promoter region 5' upstream of the binding site of NKX2-1 and regulates RET expression. HOXB5 and NKX2-1 form a protein complex and mediate RET expression in a synergistic manner. HSCR associated SNPs at the NKX2-1 binding site (-5G>A rs10900296; -1A>C rs10900297), which reduce NKX2-1 binding, abolish the synergistic trans-activation of RET by HOXB5 and NKX2-1. In contrast to the synergistic activation of RET with NKX2-1, HOXB5 cooperates in an additive manner with SOX10, PAX3 and PHOX2B in trans-activation of RET promoter. Taken together, our data suggests that HOXB5 in coordination with other transcription factors mediates RET expression. Therefore, defects in cis- or trans-regulation of RET by HOXB5 could lead to reduction of RET expression and contribute to the manifestation of the HSCR phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2151272082,"D-serine is a physiological co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. It regulates excitatory neurotransmission, which is important for higher brain functions in vertebrates. In mammalian brains, D-amino acid oxidase degrades D-serine. However, we have found recently that in chicken brains the oxidase is not expressed and instead a D-serine dehydratase degrades D-serine. The primary structure of the enzyme shows significant similarities to those of metal-activated D-threonine aldolases, which are fold-type III pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, suggesting that it is a novel class of D-serine dehydratase. In the present study, we characterized the chicken enzyme biochemically and also by x-ray crystallography. The enzyme activity on D-serine decreased 20-fold by EDTA treatment and recovered nearly completely by the addition of Zn(2+). None of the reaction products that would be expected from side reactions of the PLP-D-serine Schiff base were detected during the >6000 catalytic cycles of dehydration, indicating high reaction specificity. We have determined the first crystal structure of the D-serine dehydratase at 1.9 Å resolution. In the active site pocket, a zinc ion that coordinates His(347) and Cys(349) is located near the PLP-Lys(45) Schiff base. A theoretical model of the enzyme-D-serine complex suggested that the hydroxyl group of D-serine directly coordinates the zinc ion, and that the ε-NH(2) group of Lys(45) is a short distance from the substrate Cα atom. The α-proton abstraction from D-serine by Lys(45) and the elimination of the hydroxyl group seem to occur with the assistance of the zinc ion, resulting in the strict reaction specificity."

Bioinformatics analyses pointed to a cluster of seven P. aeruginosa genes, including homologues of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes Rv3806c, Rv3790, and Rv3791, required for synthesis of a polyprenyl-linked d-ribose precursor and its epimerization to d-Araf.

Together the data suggest that pilins of group IV strains need to be glycosylated for productive subunit-subunit interactions.

The post-translational modifications are thought to modulate interactions with eukaryotic hosts because both flagella and T4P are exposed on the cell surface and are involved in colonization. In the case of T4P, loss of pilin glycosylation has been demonstrated to decrease fitness in a mouse model of acute infection (4Smedley 3rd, J.G. Jewell E. Roguskie J. Horzempa J. Syboldt A.

Inactivation of tfpO prevents pilin glycosylation but does not block expression of surface pili or pilus-mediated “twitching” motility (1Castric P.

In contrast, PilAIV is modified on multiple Ser and Thr residues in the predicted αβ-loop and β-sheet regions with d-arabinofuranose (d-Araf) residues arranged as monomers or α1,5-linked dimers, trimers, and potentially longer polymers (3Voisin S.

The α1,5-linked configuration is found mainly in the cell wall polymers lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and arabinogalactan of Corynebacterineae, a group including the major human pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Mycobacterium avium (9Brennan P.J. Tuberculosis. 2003; 83: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). We showed previously (7Kus J.V. Kelly J. Tessier L. Harvey H. Cvitkovitch D.G. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7464-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that antibodies raised against LAM recognize glycosylated PilAIV and vice versa. The TfpW protein encoded immediately downstream of the pilin gene was implicated as a glycosyltransferase C family pilin O-oligosaccharyltransferase because tfpW knock-out and putative active site point mutants express non-glycosylated pilins (7Kus J.V. Kelly J. Tessier L. Harvey H. Cvitkovitch D.G. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7464-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The loss of pilin arabinosylation markedly decreased the amount of surface pili expressed by the tfpW mutant, implying that glycosylation may be necessary for normal pilus assembly (7Kus J.V. Kelly J. Tessier L. Harvey H. Cvitkovitch D.G. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7464-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This idea was supported by the observation that overexpression of PilAIV in a non-piliated mutant of P. aeruginosa lacking the glycosylation system did not restore motility or piliation (10Asikyan M.L. Kus J.V. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7022-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to the Corynebacterineae, d-Araf has been identified as a component of nodulation factors in some strains of rhizobia and of some O-antigens (11Wolucka B.A. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2691-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The pathway for its biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, is unknown. Synthesis could proceed via a nucleotide sugar precursor as is common for the majority of Gram-negative cell surface glycans (12Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar, 13Whitfield C. Annu. Rev.

Here we describe the identification of seven P. aeruginosa genes potentially involved in d-Araf biosynthesis and show that three are essential for pilin arabinosylation, normal pilus assembly, and twitching motility. The pilin arabinosylation system was reconstituted in a laboratory strain of P. aeruginosa that does not normally express glycosylated pili, confirming that the genes identified were both necessary and sufficient. The d-ribose to d-Araf epimerization step of arabinan biosynthesis was recently hailed as a “magic drug target” as compounds targeting this aspect of the pathway effectively kill both intracellular and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (14Makarov V.

Escherichia coli DH5α or the dam−/dcm− strain C2925 (New England Biolabs) were used for cloning, whereas E. coli SM10 was used to introduce knock-out constructs into P. aeruginosa by biparental mating. All restriction and DNA polymerase enzymes were from Fermentas and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Twitching motility was measured as described previously (3Voisin S. Kus J.V. Houliston S. St-Michael F. Watson D. Cvitkovitch D.G. Kelly J. Brisson J.R. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, bacterial strains were stab-inoculated to the bottom of 1% LB agar plates containing antibiotics and l-arabinose. After a 48-h incubation at 37 °C in a humidified container, the agar was carefully removed, and the twitching zones on the plastic surface were stained for 15 min with 1% (w/v) crystal violet in distilled H2O. After decanting the crystal violet, the plates were gently rinsed with tap water to remove excess dye and air-dried. The areas of twitching zones were measured using NIH ImageJ software. Surface proteins were isolated by shearing as described previously (3Voisin S. Kus J.V. Houliston S. St-Michael F. Watson D. Cvitkovitch D.G. Kelly J. Brisson J.R. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, strains were streaked in a gridlike pattern on LB plates containing antibiotics and l-arabinose. Two plates per sample were used. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were gently scraped from the agar surface using a coverslip and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS. After vigorous vortexing for 30 s to shear pili and flagella, the cells were removed by centrifugation, and supernatant proteins were precipitated overnight at 4 °C by the addition of 1 m MgCl2 to give a final concentration of 100 mm. The precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended in 50–100 μl of 1× sample buffer (80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5.3% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 2% (w/v) SDS) depending on the size of the pellet. Samples were boiled for 10 min before separation on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels at 150 V with a prestained molecular weight marker (Fermentas). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for 1 h at 220 mA. The membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 12 h at 4 °C. For detection of the pilin, anti-PilAIV (1:5000 in PBS; rabbit number 286) was used. For detection of the pilin glycan, anti-M. tuberculosis LAM (1:1000 in PBS) obtained through NIAID, National Institutes of Health Contract HHSN266200400091C entitled “Tuberculosis Vaccine Testing and Research Materials,” awarded to Colorado State University, was used. For detection, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit-IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad), diluted 1:3000 in PBS, washed 4 × 5 min in PBS, and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in alkaline phosphatase buffer (Bio-Rad). For mass spectrometry, the Pa5196 PsPA76250–51 double mutant was streaked in a grid pattern on 20 LB agar plates that were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Recombinant PAO1 strains were similarly grown on LB plates containing 30 μg/ml gentamicin, 200 μg/ml carbenicillin, and 0.05% l-arabinose. Pili were isolated as described previously (7Kus J.V. Kelly J. Tessier L. Harvey H. Cvitkovitch D.G. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7464-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a total of 0.5–3.0 ml of PBS depending on the size of the pellet, and dialyzed in 50 mm NH4HCO3 using a dialysis cassette (Slide-A-Lyzer, 3500 molecular weight cutoff, Thermo Scientific). The intact mass of pilins was determined as described previously (7Kus J.V. Kelly J. Tessier L. Harvey H. Cvitkovitch D.G. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7464-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, pilin solutions were desalted by centrifugal filtration (Millipore 0.5-ml Amicon Ultra filter unit, 3000 molecular weight cutoff membrane), evaporated to dryness on a Savant centrifugal evaporator, and resuspended in 10 μl of concentrated formic acid. The proteins were solubilized by the addition of 90 μl of hexafluoroisopropanol. For some of the pilin samples, the quality of the electrospray ionization-MS spectra was significantly improved by the addition of 200–300 μl of deionized water. All mass spectra were acquired on a Q-TOF2 hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters). Pilin solutions were infused at 1 μl/min into the nanoelectrospray interface, and spectra were recorded in the m/z range 800 to 2000 (one acquisition per s). MaxEnt (Waters) was used to derive protein molecular weight profiles from the spectra. Strains Pa5196 and PA7 express pilins (PilAIV) modified with d-Araf (3Voisin S. Kus J.V. Houliston S.

Cvitkovitch D.G. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7464-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using the publicly available PA7 genome sequence (17Roy P.H. Tetu S.G. Larouche A. Elbourne L. Tremblay S. Ren Q. Dodson R. Harkins D. Shay R. Watkins K. Mahamoud Y. Paulsen I.T. PloS One. 2010; 5: e8842Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we searched for genes that could encode the biosynthesis of d-Araf. Our previous work (7Kus J.V. Kelly J. Tessier L. Harvey H. Cvitkovitch D.G. Burrows L.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7464-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that only group IV strains produced pilins modified with d-Araf, implying that only they have the biosynthetic machinery to make the sugar. Examination of available P. aeruginosa genomes revealed a number of open reading frames (ORFs) unique to PA7, many of which were annotated as phage-related genes or insertion sequences (data not shown), but there were no candidate arabinose biosynthetic genes among them. We next searched for P. aeruginosa orthologues of the M. tuberculosis Rv3790 and Rv3791 genes encoding the oxidoreductase DprE1 and the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase DprE2, respectively, which together catalyze the two-step 2′-epimerization of decaprenyl-P-d-ribose to the essential precursor, decaprenyl-P-d-arabinofuranose (Fig. 1A) (18Mikusová K. Huang H. Yagi T. Holsters M. Vereecke D. D'Haeze W. Scherman M.S. Brennan P.J. McNeil M.R. Crick D.C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8020-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). BLASTP searches of available P. aeruginosa genomes (19Winsor G.L. Van Rossum T. Lo R. Khaira B. Whiteside M.D. Hancock R.E. Brinkman F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D483-D488Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) using Rv3790 and Rv3791 as query sequences revealed potential homologues in all genomes examined, although the overall similarities were highest between the M. tuberculosis ORFs and those of strain PA7 (33 and 30% identity, respectively). The genes were located in one of two adjacent but divergently oriented clusters containing a total of seven genes (Fig. 1B). The five-gene cluster encodes a hypothetical protein (6247; the prefix PsPA7 is omitted from this point forward for brevity) with weak similarity to GtrA-like glucosyltransferases involved in LPS and teichoic acid synthesis, the aforementioned homologues of M. tuberculosis Rv3790 and Rv3791 (6248 and 6249), a hypothetical protein (6250) with limited similarity to glycosyltransferases, and a hypothetical protein (6251) with similarity to 3′-acyltransferases (Fig. 1B). Examination of the potential operon structure using the MicrobesOnline Operon Prediction algorithm (20Price M.N. Huang K.H. Alm E.J. Arkin A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) suggested that only the first three genes in the cluster were likely to be co-transcribed. Two P. syringae strains (P. syringae sv. phaesolicola 1448A and P. syringae pv. syringae B728A) also have contiguous homologues of Rv3790 and Rv3791 (Fig. 1B). A search of the NCBI databases with the PA7 genes 6248 and 6249 revealed that the closest hits outside of Pseudomonas were in genera found in the environment such as Chlorobium, Syntrophobacter, Sulforovum, Rhodobacter, and Rhizobium where they are also arranged as a contiguous pair although not in syntenic clusters (data not shown). Hits in other P. aeruginosa genomes had less similarity to the Mycobacterium genes and were not contiguous; therefore, they were unlikely to be genuine orthologues, a hypothesis supported by functional analyses (below). The two genes in the divergently oriented cluster (6246 and 6245; Fig. 1B) are homologues of the M. tuberculosis genes Rv3806c and Rv3807c, respectively, encoding the decaprenyl-P-ribose-5-P synthetase (21Huang H. Scherman M.S. D'Haeze W. Vereecke D. Holsters M. Crick D.C. McNeil M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24539-24543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and a putative decaprenylphosphoryl-5-phosphoribose phosphatase required to form decaprenyl-P-d-ribose, the precursor of decaprenyl-P-d-arabinofuranose (Fig. 1A). Homologues of these genes were absent from other Pseudomonas genomes with the exception of the above P. syringae strains in which the homologues of Rv3806c, Rv3790, and Rv3791 are contiguous (Fig. 1B). In PA7, the putative d-arabinose biosynthetic genes are adjacent to ORFs 6244 through 6237, required for the biosynthesis, polymerization, and export of the nucleotide sugar GDP-d-rhamnose to form the A-band O-antigen common to all P. aeruginosa strains (22Rocchetta H.L. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 523-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This genetic organization differs from that of other P. aeruginosa strains (supplemental Fig. S1) where the A-band O-antigen biosynthetic genes are adjacent to an unrelated gene cluster potentially involved in the biosynthesis of an unknown polysaccharide as it includes putative glycosyltransferase genes. Related genes are located downstream of the d-Araf cluster in PA7 but in the opposite orientation, suggesting that its 6245–51 cluster was acquired via horizontal gene transfer. Evidence of homologous recombination within the first gene of the A-band LPS cluster is apparent upon comparison of the Rmd sequences of PA7 with those of other P. aeruginosa strains. The N terminus of PA7 Rmd is divergent, whereas the C terminus is conserved (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, Gmd, which is encoded immediately downstream of Rmd, is completely conserved among P. aeruginosa strains (data not shown). To test for the potential involvement of the 6245–51 genes in d-Araf biosynthesis, we generated single knock-outs of 6246 through 6251 in strain Pa5196 as well as a double knock-out of 6250 and 6251. The requirement for 6245 in d-Araf biosynthesis was tested by reconstitution experiments (below). Pa5196 was used as the parent strain for mutagenesis because PA7 is multidrug-resistant and poorly piliated (7Kus J.V. Kelly J. Tessier L. Harvey H. Cvitkovitch D.G. Burrows L.L. J.

In China, little data regarding rates of Cryptosporidium infections in pigs are available. The present study was therefore aimed at characterizing the distribution of Cryptosporidium species in pigs from two different cities, Shaoxing and Shanghai, from the Yangtze River delta.Nested PCR to amplify the 18S rRNA locus on DNA extracted from fecal samples (n = 94) revealed the positive rate of Cryptosporidium in pigs from two cities was approximately 17.0%. The positive rates in Shanghai and Shaoxing were 14.3% and 25.0% respectively. Amplified sequences were verified by sequencing. The identified strain belonged to the C. pig genotype II using BLAST analysis in the NCBI database.Our finding of Cryptosporidium pig genotype II in pigs in the Yangtze River delta area suggests that pig farms in this region must be considered a public health threat and proper control measures be introduced."
https://openalex.org/W1968820055,"The exquisite specificity of the adenine-responsive riboswitch toward its cognate metabolite has been shown to arise from the formation of a Watson-Crick interaction between the adenine ligand and residue U65. A recent crystal structure of a U65C adenine aptamer variant has provided a rationale for the phylogenetic conservation observed at position 39 for purine aptamers. The G39-C65 variant adopts a compact ligand-free structure in which G39 is accommodated by the ligand binding site and is base-paired to the cytosine at position 65. Here, we demonstrate using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques that the G39-C65 base pair not only severely impairs ligand binding but also disrupts the functioning of the riboswitch in vivo by constitutively activating gene expression. Folding studies using single-molecule FRET revealed that the G39-C65 variant displays a low level of dynamic heterogeneity, a feature reminiscent of ligand-bound wild-type complexes. A restricted conformational freedom together with an ability to significantly fold in monovalent ions are exclusive to the G39-C65 variant. This work provides a mechanistic framework to rationalize the evolutionary exclusion of certain nucleotide combinations in favor of sequences that preserve ligand binding and gene regulation functionalities."
https://openalex.org/W2163423738,"The cationic antimicrobial oligo-acyl-lysyls (OAKs) interact with lipid mixtures mimicking the composition of bacterial cytoplasmic membranes. We have reported the ability of one such OAK, C12K-7α8, to cluster anionic lipids and to promote a structural change with lipid bilayers to form rolled cylindrical structures or cochleates, without requiring divalent cations for their assembly. These assemblies can be exploited for drug delivery, permitting their synergistic use with antibiotics in systemic therapy to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity. Our previous studies of the biophysical properties of these systems led us to select mixtures with the goal of optimizing their potential for enhancing effectiveness in combating bacterial multidrug resistance. Here, we further investigate the properties of such mixtures that result in enhanced in vivo activity. The role of erythromycin in the assembly of cochleates with OAK in the gel and the liquid crystalline states were assessed, as well as the encapsulation efficiency of the systems chosen. In addition, we found that erythromycin did not undermine the ability of OAKs to induce fusion of vesicles, fusion being an essential component of cochleate formation. The in vivo activity of the new assemblies tested resulted in higher survival rates of animals infected with multidrug resistant bacteria.—Sarig, H., Ohana, D., Epand, R. F., Mor, A., Epand, R. M.

https://openalex.org/W2084686887,"Cell-based therapy shows promise in treating peripheral arterial disease (PAD); however, the optimal cell type and long-term efficacy are unknown. In this study, we identified a novel subpopulation of adult progenitor cells positive for CD34 and M-cadherin (CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ BMCs) in mouse and human bone marrow. We also examined the long-lasting therapeutic efficacy of mouse CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ BMCs in restoring blood flow and promoting vascularization in an atherosclerotic mouse model of PAD.Colony-forming cell assays and flow cytometry analysis showed that CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ BMCs have hematopoietic progenitor properties. When delivered intra-arterially into the ischemic hindlimbs of ApoE⁻/⁻ mice, CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ BMCs alleviated ischemia and significantly improved blood flow compared with CD34⁺/M-cad⁻ BMCs, CD34⁻/M-cad⁺ BMCs, or unselected BMCs. Significantly more arterioles were seen in CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ cell-treated limbs than in any other treatment group 60 days after cell therapy. Furthermore, histologic assessment and morphometric analyses of hindlimbs treated with GFP⁺ CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ cells showed that injected cells incorporated into solid tissue structures at 21 days. Confocal microscopic examination of GFP⁺ CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ cell-treated ischemic legs followed by immunostaining indicated the vascular differentiation of CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ progenitor cells. A cytokine antibody array revealed that CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ cell-conditioned medium contained higher levels of cytokines in a unique pattern, including bFGF, CRG-2, EGF, Flt-3 ligand, IGF-1, SDF-1, and VEGFR-3, than did CD34⁺/M-cad⁻ cell-conditioned medium. The proangiogenic cytokines secreted by CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ cells induced oxygen- and nutrient-depleted endothelial cell sprouting significantly better than CD34⁺/M-cad⁻ cells during hypoxia.CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ BMCs represent a new progenitor cell type that effectively alleviates hindlimb ischemia in ApoE⁻/⁻ mice by consistently improving blood flow and promoting arteriogenesis. Additionally, CD34⁺/M-cad⁺ BMCs contribute to microvascular remodeling by differentiating into vascular cells and releasing proangiogenic cytokines and growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2074429117,"Telomeres containing vertebrate-type DNA repeats can be stably maintained in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We show here that telomerase is required for growth of yeast cells containing these vertebrate-type telomeres. When present at the chromosome termini, these heterologous repeats elicit a DNA damage response and a certain deprotection of telomeres. The data also show that these phenotypes are due only to the terminal localization of the vertebrate repeats because if they are sandwiched between native yeast repeats, no phenotype is observed. Indeed and quite surprisingly, in this latter situation, telomeres are of virtually normal lengths, despite the presence of up to 50% of heterologous repeats. Furthermore, the presence of the distal vertebrate-type repeats can cause increased problems of the replication fork. These results show that in budding yeast the integrity of the 3′ overhang is required for proper termination of telomere replication as well as protection.

Indeed and quite surprisingly, in this latter situation, telomeres are of virtually normal lengths, despite the presence of up to 50% of heterologous repeats. Furthermore, the presence of the distal vertebrate-type repeats can cause increased problems of the replication fork. These results show that in budding yeast the integrity of the 3′ overhang is required for proper termination of telomere replication as well as protection. Specialized ribonucleoprotein complexes known as telomeres protect the natural ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, telomeres are composed of an ∼300-bp double-stranded (ds) 4The abbreviations used are: dsdouble-strandedsssingle-strandedT-Ttelomere-telomereDDRDNA damage responseFOA5-fluoro-orotic acidYPDyeast extract peptone D-glucose. tract of irregular repeats, abbreviated TG1–3/C1–3A, and terminate with a 12- to 14-nt single-stranded (ss) 3′ overhang made of the TG1–3 motifs (1Shampay J.

In contrast, vertebrate telomeres contain a ds tract containing thousands of T2AG3/C3TA2 repeats and terminate with a ss 3′ overhang made of T2AG3 motifs (2LeBel C. Wellinger R.J. J.

The complete replication of linear eukaryotic chromosomes requires the de novo addition of telomeric repeats to chromosome ends by telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase (for reviews, see Refs. 6Greider C.W.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2309-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The core telomerase components are a reverse-transcriptase catalytic subunit and a RNA moiety. In yeast, these components are known as Est2p and TLC1, respectively (8Hug N. Lingner J. Chromosoma. 2006; 115: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The telomerase RNA always contains a short region that is complementary to the G-rich strand of telomeric repeats, and that region is used as a template for repeat addition (7Gilson E. Géli V. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 9Shore D. Bianchi A. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2309-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Telomerase invalidation leads to gradual telomere shortening and ultimately causes cells to stop dividing (7Gilson E. Géli V. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 9Shore D. Bianchi A. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2309-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Lundblad V. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, cellular backup mechanisms can maintain telomeres in the absence of telomerase and ultimately preserve genome integrity. In this mode of telomere maintenance, which is known as alternative lengthening of telomeres in human cells, and survivor mode in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, telomeric DNA is maintained via homologous recombination-based mechanisms (11Lundblad V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 522-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cesare A.J. Reddel R.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). By differentiating chromosomal ends from internal ds breaks, telomeres also prevent chromosomal ends from eliciting DNA damage checkpoint activation and protect telomeres from inappropriate DNA repair activity. Binding of the multiprotein complex shelterin is essential for both protecting and maintaining the length of mammalian telomeres (13Palm W. de Lange T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 301-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 14Giraud-Panis M.J. Pisano S. Poulet A. Le Du M.H. Gilson E. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3785-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rap1p, one of the several proteins associated with similar functions at budding yeast telomeres, binds directly to ds telomeric repeats and functions to regulate telomere length homeostasis and to prevent telomere-telomere fusions (7Gilson E. Géli V. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 9Shore D. Bianchi A.

Shore D. Science. 1997; 275: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the terminal telomeric repeat tracts can be changed from the budding yeast-specific sequences to vertebrate-type repeats by changing the RNA template region of TLC1 to a C3TA2-rich sequence (18Henning K.A. Moskowitz N. Ashlock M.A. Liu P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5667-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Analyses of S. cerevisiae strains containing such C3TA2-rich telomeres have shown that these telomeres are devoid of Rap1p but are bound by Del ScTbf1p, which appears to be able to maintain telomeres in the absence of Rap1p (19Berthiau A.S.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that these vertebrate-type repeats are subject to high turnover, the cells are subjected to cellular stress, and that in the absence of the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Tel1p and Mec1p, telomeres are prone to fusing (22di Domenico E.G. Auriche C. Viscardi V. Longhese M.P. Gilson E. Ascenzioni F. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Bah A. Bachand F. Clair E. Autexier C. Wellinger R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1917-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It therefore remained unclear how these new chimeric telomeric protein-DNA complexes ensure chromosome protection and the maintenance of telomeric repeat tracts. Our results shown here demonstrate that yeast strains with distal vertebrate telomeric repeats absolutely depend on the telomerase enzyme for growth, suggesting that such chromosome ends require very frequent telomerase elongation events. Furthermore, the presence of significant 3′ vertebrate repeat overhangs at chromosomal ends activates the DNA damage response. Quite surprisingly, composite telomeres, on which as much as 146 bp of vertebrate telomeric repeats are sandwiched between native yeast repeats, remained at a length indistinguishable of endogenous wild-type yeast telomeres and did not cause any cellular phenotypes. We propose that yeast-specific telomere proximal and distal repeats may allow some structural arrangement that can determine overall telomere length, even in the presence of intervening non-yeast telomeric sequences. All yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Yeasts were manipulated according to standard methods (24Rose M. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990: 1-200Google Scholar). Plasmids and deletion cassettes were transformed according to Ref. 25Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar. Deletions of indicated genes were generated by a one-step PCR gene replacement technique where the complete ORF was replaced by a kanMX4 or natMX4 resistance cassette (26Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2649) Google Scholar). Doxycycline-regulatable strains were generated by a one-step PCR substitution of the original promoter by a kanMX4-tTA-ADH1t-tetO2 promoter amplified from pCM224 (27Bellí G. Garí E. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). All created strains were validated for correct gene disruption or promoter substitution by appropriate phenotypic analysis and genomic locus arrangement by PCR. Yeast strains were grown in the appropriate media until they reached exponential phase (1 × 107 cells/ml). Cell concentrations were measured at A660 nm. A volume of an equal number of cells for each strain was serially diluted in steps of 10-fold and spotted on the indicated plate media. Yeast cells were grown to exponential phase, and total protein extracts were prepared by a TCA precipitation procedure as described in Ref. 28Paciotti V. Clerici M. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2046-2059PubMed Google Scholar. Proteins were resolved on a 8% acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide (30:0.39) SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a membrane, and Rad53p forms were detected with an anti-Rad53 rabbit antibody (29Pike B.L.

Heierhorst, St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia), followed by secondary detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (GE Healthcare). Amplification and cloning of the unique V-R ADE2 telomere from ScV500Sc and ScV1000Sc strains was performed as described previously (23Bah A. Bachand F. Clair E. Autexier C. Wellinger R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1917-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Amplification of telomere-telomere (T-T) fusions from ScV2000 and ScV2500 strains was performed as described in Ref. 16Pardo B. Marcand S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3117-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, with slight modifications. HindIII-X2 (cgcAAGCTTTGTGGTGGTGGGATTAGAGTGGTAG) and EcoRI-Y'2 (cgGAATTCTTAGGGCTATGTAGAAGTGCTG) primers were used for T-T PCR, and products were cloned in pUC19. As a loading control for each sample, ARO1+ (TGACTGGTACTACCGTAACGGTTC) and ARO1- (GAATACCATCTGGTAATTCTGTAGTTTTGAC) primers were used to amplify a 371 bp fragment corresponding to the ORF of the non-telomeric gene ARO1 (30Fisher T.S. Taggart A.K. Zakian V.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All plasmids were sequenced at the Centre Hôpitalier Universitaire Laval Research Center, Quebec City, Canada. 32P-radiolabeled probes were used to detect single-stranded and double-stranded telomeric DNA containing either vertebrate- or yeast-specific repeats in XhoI-digested genomic DNAs resolved on agarose gels, essentially as described previously (23Bah A. Bachand F. Clair E. Autexier C. Wellinger R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1917-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31LeBel C. Larrivée M. Bah A. Laterreur N. Lvesque N. Wellinger R.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 265-316PubMed Google Scholar). DNA content from asynchronously and exponentially growing cultures at 30 °C was measured as described previously (32Vodenicharov M.D. Laterreur N. Wellinger R.J. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We replaced the WT allele of the gene encoding the RNA moiety (TLC1) of the core telomerase of S. cerevisiae with the tlc1h allele, which encodes a vertebrate-type telomeric repeat sequence. This mutation causes a replacement of the distal yeast-specific telomeric repeat sequence (TG1–3)n with (T2AG3)n (18Henning K.A. Moskowitz N. Ashlock M.A. Liu P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5667-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae strains that rely on tlc1h for telomerase activity are designated “ScV yeast,” and the yeast-type and mixed-type telomeric repeats are hereafter designated “Sc” and “ScV” or “ScVSc,” respectively. As expected (33Khadaroo B. Teixeira M.T. Luciano P. Eckert-Boulet N. Germann S.M. Simon M.N. Gallina I. Abdallah P. Gilson E. Géli V. Lisby M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 980-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), doxycycline-induced repression of the WT TLC1 gene in otherwise non-modified strains is tolerated for at least 50 generations without detectable major loss of viability (Fig. 1A, upper panels). In contrast, the repression of tlc1h in the ScV yeast cells led to an immediate growth arrest (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Consistent with this result, the ScV yeast cells required the catalytic activity of Est2p for growth (Fig. 1B) and were sensitive to Pif1p overexpression, which is known to inhibit telomere elongation by telomerase (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C and Ref. 34Vega L.R. Phillips J.A. Thornton B.R. Benanti J.A. Onigbanjo M.T. Toczyski D.P. Zakian V.A. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e105Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The observation that ScV yeast cells required continuous expression of telomerase for viability might be explained by the fact that the ScV telomeres were, on average, shorter than the WT telomeres. Thus, the ScV telomeres might rapidly become too short or otherwise dysfunctional after the loss of telomerase. However, the expression of a fused protein Cdc13-Est2p, which slightly increases the mean length of ScV telomeres (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2), did not allow the ScV cells to bypass their immediate requirement for telomerase (supplemental Fig. S2A). Consistent with the presence of irreversible telomere damage in these cells, ScV cells lacking RAD9 also lost viability without delay (data not shown). The above results led us to examine whether the presence of Sc-type termini would ameliorate the exquisite sensitivity of ScV yeast to the loss of telomerase. Toward this end, after the cells were grown for 500 or 1000 generations with the tlc1h allele, the tlc1h allele was exchanged again with a WT TLC1 gene carried on a plasmid (creating strains designated ScV500Sc and ScV1000Sc, respectively). Sequencing of the resulting telomeres confirmed that yeast-specific sequences were incorporated distal to the preexisting vertebrate-type repeats (supplemental Fig. S3). In all cases examined, the telomeres retained a significant number of vertebrate-type repeats, so that T2AG3 repeats were sandwiched between TG1–3 repeats (supplemental Fig. S3, D and E). Importantly, the tracts of vertebrate-type telomeric repeats in ScVSc telomeres and in ScV telomeres were in most cases comparable in length (about 75 to 145 nt, see supplemental Fig. S3 and Ref. 23Bah A. Bachand F. Clair E. Autexier C. Wellinger R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1917-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Like cells with WT Sc telomeres, cells with ScV500Sc or ScV1000Sc telomeres were initially able to form colonies on a plate after the loss of telomerase (Fig. 2A, plate FOA (20 G)). However, although the WT cells continued to be able to form normal colonies for at least one more passage, the colonies resulting from subsequent passages of the cells initially containing ScVSc telomeres were heterogeneous in size, and many were very small (Fig. 2A, plate YPD(40 G)). This latter pattern is reminiscent of that seen in senescing WT cultures after telomerase loss (10Lundblad V. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 35Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 36Abdallah P. Luciano P. Runge K.W. Lisby M. Géli V. Gilson E. Teixeira M.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, plate YPD(60 G)). Cultured cells after each growth period were examined for the structure of their telomeres (Fig. 2, B and C). About half of all telomeres in yeast lab strains contain a conserved subtelomeric element called Y' that harbors an XhoI site about 950 bp from the transition to the terminal repeat DNA (31LeBel C. Larrivée M. Bah A. Laterreur N. Lvesque N. Wellinger R.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 265-316PubMed Google Scholar). On Southern blots of XhoI-digested DNA probed with telomere-specific probes, the terminal restriction fragments of these telomeres are about 1.0 to 1.4 kb in size, depending on the length of the terminal repeats. The other half of the telomeres harbor a less conserved X element, and the terminal restriction fragments of those telomeres will be of various sizes above 2 kb (31LeBel C. Larrivée M. Bah A. Laterreur N. Lvesque N. Wellinger R.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 265-316PubMed Google Scholar). Cells initially containing WT Sc telomeres exhibited gradual telomere shortening (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4), whereas the telomeres of both ScVSc telomere-containing cells were clearly rearranged after 30 generations (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), despite the fact that they started out with telomeres of about the same length as those of WT cells (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1–3). This new arrangement was similar to that seen in survivors type I for the ScV500Sc telomere strain (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 6, 9, and 12) and in survivors type II for the ScV1000Sc telomere strain (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 5, 8, and 11) (see Refs. 37Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 38Teng S.C. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8083-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the majority of the distal yeast repeats were lost during initial cell growth and that as soon as the vertebrate-type repeats were exposed at the ends, the cells stopped growing, just as cells harboring ScV telomeres did (Fig. 1). Thus, in the absence of telomerase, the vertebrate-type repeats appear to represent an immediate threat to telomere stability when they constitute the 3′ terminus but not when they are located internally as a dsDNA sequence. However and remarkably, despite the presence of up to 24 T2AG3 repeats (about 145 bp) in these telomeres, the mean lengths of the ScV500Sc and ScV1000Sc telomeres are indistinguishable from those of telomeres containing yeast repeats only, i.e. WT telomeres (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3) (see also Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S3F). Because there is evidence that the DNA damage response (DDR) is activated in ScV yeast cells as shown by Rad53p phosphorylation assays (22di Domenico E.G. Auriche C. Viscardi V. Longhese M.P. Gilson E. Ascenzioni F. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the DDR was associated with the presence of the T2AG3 3′ overhangs or was a consequence of other problems occurring during replication of vertebrate telomeric repeats in yeast. As noted previously, the 3′ overhang made of vertebrate repeats gradually lengthened as the number of generations in the presence of the tlc1h allele increased (Fig. 3, A and B) (see also Refs.18Henning K.A. Moskowitz N. Ashlock M.A. Liu P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5667-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Bah A. Bachand F. Clair E. Autexier C. Wellinger R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1917-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, significant Rad53p phosphorylation was not discernible before 60 generations of growth but was detectable after 500 generations of growth, coincident with a slight delay in the G2/M transition in such cultures (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 3 and 4, and supplemental Fig. S4). The level of Rad53 phosphorylation was relatively low compared with that triggered by the DNA-damaging agent phleomycin. In the absence of the checkpoint mediator Rad9p, Rad53p phosphorylation was lost, and the G2/M delay was abolished (Fig. 3D, lane 6 and supplemental Fig. S4). Upon reverting the T2AG3 3′ overhang to the normal yeast TG1–3 type (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–10), Rad53p phosphorylation and the G2/M delay are abolished (Fig. 3D, lanes 8 and 9 and supplemental Fig. S4). These data are thus consistent with the interpretation that terminal vertebrate-type telomeric repeats are deficient in providing normal capping function. Using a PCR-based assay specifically developed for detecting telomere fusions in yeast (16Pardo B. Marcand S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3117-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we indeed detected telomere-telomere fusions in cultures of ScV yeast cells that had grown for more than 500 generations (Fig. 4). Interestingly, sequencing the fusion PCR products revealed human-type repeats at the fusion points (see examples in supplemental Fig. S5), indicating that at least in these cases, a failure of telomere capping allowed fusions directly onto the existing distal human-type repeats. We conclude that telomeres ending with vertebrate-type T2AG3 repeats are partially uncapped, leading to an activation of DDR and telomere fusions. Thus, telomerase appears to be required to maintain a level of capping compatible with growth. To be able to tolerate telomerase loss and maintain telomeric repeats, WT S. cerevisiae cells depend on Rad52 and Mms1, two proteins involved in the repair of stalled replication forks (36Abdallah P. Luciano P. Runge K.W. Lisby M. Géli V. Gilson E. Teixeira M.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 37Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Indeed, deleting the RAD52 gene from ScV cells significantly decreased their ability to grow (Fig. 5). Moreover, when replication stress was induced by hydroxyurea treatment, the ScV cells were more sensitive than the WT cells to a loss of MRC1 and to a slightly lesser extent TOF1, two proteins required for normal fork progression (39Tourrière H. Versini G. Cordón-Preciado V. Alabert C. Pasero P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 699-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, Fig. 5). Furthermore, as revealed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, replication forks in ScV cells appeared to arrest near the telomeric repeats and signals for Holliday junctions, and replication bubbles were increased (supplemental Fig. S6). Therefore, yeast strains harboring vertebrate-type termini are impaired in the replication of their telomeres with heterologous repeats. Budding yeast cells can be quite tolerant in terms of their requirements for the precise sequence of the telomeric repeats capping their chromosomes. Indeed, even telomeres composed entirely of vertebrate-type repeats are kept stable during mitotic growth (18Henning K.A. Moskowitz N. Ashlock M.A. Liu P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5667-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Brevet V. Berthiau A.S. Civitelli L. Donini P. Schramke V. Géli V. Ascenzioni F. Gilson E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Alexander M.K. Zakian V.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Remarkably, on these telomeres, the hallmark telomere binding protein Rap1p appears to be replaced with Tbf1p, and there is some evidence to show that this latter protein can maintain a telomere length regulatory mechanism (19Berthiau A.S. Yankulov K. Bah A. Revardel E. Luciano P. Wellinger R.J. Géli V. Gilson E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Brevet V. Berthiau A.S. Civitelli L. Donini P. Schramke V. Géli V. Ascenzioni F. Gilson E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear how this mechanism could ensure telomere capping and stability in this situation. The results shown here demonstrate that when cells harbor hybrid yeast-vertebrate telomeres, the enzyme telomerase becomes absolutely essential for continued cell division. Further, cells behaved the same whether a catalytic dead allele of Est2p is expressed or Est2p is lost altogether, showing that it is the activity of telomerase that is required (Fig. 1). One interpretation of these data would be that in ScV yeast cells, there always are a number of critically short telomeres that would cause growth arrest immediately after telomerase loss. However, several considerations lead us to suggest otherwise. First, in yku80Δ or tel1Δ cells containing telomeres that are as short as or even shorter than those described above, the transient loss of telomerase is tolerated. yku80Δtlc1Δ cells can grow for at least a few generations to generate microcolonies on plates, and tel1Δtlc1Δ cells can even form colonies (40Gravel S. Larrivée M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 41Ritchie K.B. Mallory J.C. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6065-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Second, forced expression of a Cdc13-Est2p product, although only slightly elongating telomeres and formally not excluding the presence of a few critically short telomeres, also does not allow growth (Fig. 1, B and C). Third, yeast cells with ScVSc telomeres do allow telomerase loss, but cells stop growing after only about 20–30 generations of outgrowth (Fig. 2). This latter observation is consistent with the observation that during those first 20–30 generations, the distal most yeast repeats are progressively lost, and as soon as the vertebrate-type repeats become terminal, telomeres are destabilized. Taken together, these results therefore suggest that 3′ ends consisting of vertebrate-type T2AG3 repeats uncap yeast chromosome ends even in the presence of internal yeast-type repeats. As a consequence, telomeres with terminal vertebrate repeats may be subject to much more dynamic turnover than WT telomeres and therefore require telomerase-mediated extension at a very frequent rate. Furthermore, such ends will eventually elicit a chronic low-level DDR response and be subject to telomere-telomere fusions (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Of note, these fusions do occur in the presence of active Mec1p and Tel1p kinases. Therefore, the telomere-telomere fusions observed in late-generation ScV cells are not completely preventable by these kinases, as was reported previously (22di Domenico E.G. Auriche C. Viscardi V. Longhese M.P. Gilson E. Ascenzioni F. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Presently, we ignore the reason for these experimental differences, but strain backgrounds and differing technical protocols could cause different outcomes. Nevertheless, the telomere-telomere fusions observed in the presence of the Tel1p/Mec1p kinases could also explain the increased gross chromosomal instability observed in late ScV yeast cells (22di Domenico E.G. Auriche C. Viscardi V. Longhese M.P. Gilson E. Ascenzioni F. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Quite remarkably, if located internally, as much as half of the repeats on yeast telomeres can be of the vertebrate-type without causing any telomere length changes or other perceptible phenotypes. Previous results showed that telomeric vertebrate-type repeats in yeast are bound by Tbf1p, but no Rap1p or Rif2p associations are detectable (21Alexander M.K. Zakian V.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the homeostasis of overall telomere length has been proposed to be regulated by a mechanism that somehow accounts for the actual number of Rap1p and, in particular, Rif-proteins present at telomeres (17Marcand S. Gilson E. Shore D. Science. 1997; 275: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), but evidence for Rap1p-independent telomere length control mechanisms exists (20Brevet V. Berthiau A.S. Civitelli L. Donini P. Schramke V. Géli V. Ascenzioni F. Gilson E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The near-WT length of mixed ScVSc-telomeres that contain about 50% fewer yeast repeats than an average WT Sc-telomere suggests that Rap1p binding at the subtelomere-telomere transition and at the distal-most repeats is crucial for allowing normal telomere homeostasis. It remains unclear whether in the situation of ScVSc telomeres, the vertebrate-type repeats, via the binding of Tbf1p, do actively contribute to overall telomere length regulation. Tbf1p has been shown to be able to contribute to telomere length regulation (19Berthiau A.S. Yankulov K. Bah A. Revardel E. Luciano P. Wellinger R.J. Géli V. Gilson E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and to promote telomere elongation of short telomeres, at least in the absence of Tel1p (42Arnerić M. Lingner J. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 1080-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that the ∼75- to 145-bp vertebrate repeats are too short to separate the proximal repeats from the distal repeat tracts to allow the establishment of a new and distally located independent telomere (43Ray A. Runge K.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Yet, one previous report showed that 138 bp without a Rap1p binding site is sufficient to separate two tracts of Rap1p binding sequence to separate those domains (43Ray A. Runge K.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The partial telomere uncapping described above is accompanied by increases in problems for telomere replication by the conventional machinery (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S6), which suggests a tight and specific coupling between the 3′ overhang and replication termination at chromosome ends. We propose that in ScV yeast cells, this coupling is impaired, leading to aberrant replication termination, deprotection of chromosome ends, and DDR activation. A previous report showed that abolishing Tbf1p binding near telomeric repeat sequences did not affect replication fork stalling, suggesting that Tbf1p association with the block of vertebrate repeat DNA should not be a particular problem (44Makovets S. Herskowitz I. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4019-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, juxtaposition and accumulation of a significant number of Tbf1p proteins may create a particular structure that is difficult to displace. Consistent with our fork collapse proposal, the ScV yeast cells are sensitive to loss of the ability to perform homologous recombination (Fig. 5), whereas a previous report did not observe this (21Alexander M.K. Zakian V.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We ignore the precise methodology used by those authors and therefore cannot make direct comparisons between the two. Thus, the precise mechanism by which telomerase prevents this replication-coupled and terminus-specific telomere injury remains to be determined. Recent evidence obtained in a variety of systems, including budding yeast, fission yeast, and mammalian cells, strongly suggests that the passage of the replication fork through telomeric repeats is a challenge and requires the presence of telomere repeat binding proteins and specialized helicases (45Paeschke K. McDonald K.R. Zakian V.A. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3760-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 46Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T.

https://openalex.org/W2001073277,"NMDA receptors are calcium-permeable ionotropic receptors that detect coincident glutamate binding and membrane depolarization and are essential for many forms of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain. The obligatory GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors is alternatively spliced at multiple sites, generating forms that vary in N-terminal N1 and C-terminal C1, C2, and C2' cassettes. Based on expression of GluN1 constructs in heterologous cells and in wild type neurons, the prevalent view is that the C-terminal cassettes regulate synaptic accumulation and its modulation by homeostatic activity blockade and by protein kinase C (PKC). Here, we tested the role of GluN1 splicing in regulated synaptic accumulation of NMDA receptors by lentiviral expression of individual GluN1 splice variants in hippocampal neurons cultured from GluN1 (-/-) mice. High efficiency transduction of GluN1 at levels similar to endogenous was achieved. Under control conditions, the C2' cassette mediated enhanced synaptic accumulation relative to the alternate C2 cassette, whereas the presence or absence of N1 or C1 had no effect. Surprisingly all GluN1 splice variants showed >2-fold increased synaptic accumulation with chronic blockade of NMDA receptor activity. Furthermore, in this neuronal rescue system, all GluN1 splice variants were equally rapidly dispersed upon activation of PKC. These results indicate that the major mechanisms mediating homeostatic synaptic accumulation and PKC dispersal of NMDA receptors occur independently of GluN1 splice isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2161303636,"RACK1 proteins belong to the eukaryote WD40-repeat protein family and function as spatial regulators of multiple cellular events, including signaling pathways, the cell cycle and translation. For this latter role, structural and genetic studies indicate that RACK1 associates with the ribosome through two conserved positively charged amino acids in its first WD40 domain. Unlike RACK1s, including Trypanosoma brucei RACK1 (TbRACK1), only one of these two positively-charged residues is conserved in the first WD40 domain of the Leishmania major RACK1 ortholog, LACK. We compared virulence-attenuated LACK single copy (LACK/-) L. major, with L. major expressing either two LACK copies (LACK/LACK), or one copy each of LACK and TbRACK1 (LACK/TbRACK1), to evaluate the function of these structurally distinct RACK1 orthologs with respect to translation, viability at host temperatures and pathogenesis. Our results indicate that although the ribosome-binding residues are not fully conserved in LACK, both LACK and TbRACK1 co-sedimented with monosomes and polysomes in LACK/LACK and LACK/TbRACK1 L. major, respectively. LACK/LACK and LACK/TbRACK1 strains differed in their sensitivity to translation inhibitors implying that minor sequence differences between the RACK1 proteins can alter their functional properties. While biochemically distinguishable, both LACK/LACK and LACK/TbRACK1 lines were more tolerant of elevated temperatures, resistant to translation inhibitors, and displayed robust pathogenesis in vivo, contrasting to LACK/- parasites."
