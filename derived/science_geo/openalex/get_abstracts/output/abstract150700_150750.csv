Genome-wide DNA chip analysis has been used to analyze the transcriptional response of yeast cells to saline stress. About 7% of the genes encoded in the yeast genome are induced more than 5-fold after a mild and brief saline shock (0.4m NaCl, 10 min). Interestingly, most responsive genes showed a very transient expression pattern, as mRNA levels dramatically declined after 20 min in the presence of stress. A quite similar set of genes increased expression in cells subjected to higher saline concentrations (0.8 m NaCl), although in this case the response was delayed. Therefore, our data show that cells respond to saline stress by inducing the expression of a very large number of genes and suggest that stress adaptation requires regulation of many cellular aspects. The transcriptional induction of most genes that are strongly responsive to salt stress was highly or fully dependent on the presence of the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1, indicating that the Hog1-mediated signaling pathway plays a key role in global gene regulation under saline stress conditions.

Márquez J.A. Rı́os G. Yeast Stress Responses. R. G. Landes Co., New York1997: 147-169Google Scholar), but they also share similar cation detoxification mechanisms (2.Gaxiola R.A. Rao R. Sherman A. Grisafi P. Alper S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1480-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and, most probably, signal transduction pathways (3.Lee J.H. Van Montagu M. Verbruggen N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4.Pardo J.M. Reddy M.P. Yang S. Maggio A. Huh G.H. Matsumoto T.

Exposure of yeast cells to saline stress implies both exposure to specific cation toxicity and to osmotic stress. Certain ions such as Na+ or Li+ are toxic to cells due to their ability to inhibit specific metabolic pathways, probably through inhibition of specific targets. This has been shown to be the case for the yeast Hal2 protein and certain RNA-processing enzymes (5.Murguı́a J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6.Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of intracellular ion contents represents an important response to ion stress. For instance, exposure to sodium increases the expression of the ENA1/PMR2A gene, encoding a P-type ATPase responsible for Na+ and Li+ ion efflux (7.Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8.Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Increases in extracellular osmolarity results in a transient induction of the expression of stress protective genes. A major outcome from this response is the accumulation of intracellular glycerol, which relies on the activation of the Hog11(high osmolarity glycerol response) MAP kinase pathway (9.Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 10.Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). MAP kinases play a key role in regulation of stress responses in many organisms from mammals to yeast (11.Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 798-805Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Hog1 MAP kinase is essential for the survival of yeast in high osmolarity environments (9.Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) and is activated under osmotic-stress conditions by two independent osmo-sensors, a two-component system and the transmembrane protein Sho1 (12.Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 13.Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H.

Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). These sensing mechanisms activate a kinase cascade that involves the Ssk2, Ssk22, and Ste11 MAPK kinase kinases (13.Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 15.Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), the Pbs2 MAPK kinase, and finally, the Hog1 MAPK. Once phosphorylated, the Hog1 MAPK is translocated into the nucleus, where it induces diverse stress responses. It is worth noting that both phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Hog1 are very rapid and transient (13.Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 16.Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The mechanism of gene regulation through activated Hog1 is still unknown because transcription factors under the control of this MAP kinase are not well characterized. Several candidates, however, have been described. These are the transcription factors Msn1, Msn2, and Msn4 (17.Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 18.Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the bZIP-type protein Sko1 (19.Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and Hot1 (18.Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although the requirement for the Hog1 kinase has been demonstrated for the osmotic up-regulation of a number of genes, an exhaustive list of the genes required for osmo-stress adaptation is far from complete. It is important to understand that responses to ion stress require the activity of several pathways and that a single gene can receive different inputs (20.Márquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For instance, the expression of theENA1 ATPase is regulated by both a calcium signaling pathway, which involves the protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), and the HOG signaling pathway (21.Mendizabal I. Rios G. Mulet J.M. Serrano R. de Larrinoa I.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We felt that better understanding of the yeast response to saline stress could be achieved from the use of DNA microarrays (reviewed in Ref. 22.Brown P.O. Botstein D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (2025) Google Scholar) to perform a genome-wide analysis of the transcriptional response under this type of stress. This technology has been used to accurately analyze whole genome expression in several organisms, including yeast (23.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar, 24.Cho R.J. Campbell M.J. Winzeler E.A. Steinmetz L. Conway A. Wodicka L. Wolfsberg T.G. Gabrielian A.E. Landsman D.

Because a number of examples suggested that different conditions (such as time of exposure to salt) might result in a different pattern of expression, we decided to test two different NaCl concentrations at two different time points. In addition, the role of the Hog1 MAP kinase has been investigated by testing the transcriptional response of a hog1 mutant strain under stress. Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes were reamplified from 6,035 polymerase chain reaction-amplified full-length ORFs provided by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Each of these originally amplified ORFs of S. cerevisiae contained the sequence 5′-GGAATTCCAGCTGACCACC immediately 5′ of the start ATG, thereby making it possible to re-amplify each ORF with the common primer YAMP1 (5′-GCAGTCGTGGAATTCCAGCTGACCA) and the appropriate gene-specific 3′ primer, which was also provided by Research Genetics. Amplified ORFs were purified by using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) 96-well polymerase chain reaction clean-up kits. This amplification and purification process resulted in the production of deposition targets for approximately 85% of the S. cerevisiae ORFs. The yeast gene targets were arrayed in a 12-tip format using a quill-type pin by an Intelligent Automation Systems (Cambridge, MA) microarrayer. The microarrayer tip delivered approximately 4 nl per spot on silylated aldehyde-coated glass slides (CEL Associates, Houston, TX). Yeast microarrays were hybridized for 4 h under cover slides with a Cy3-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-labeled cDNA probe. After hybridization, the labeled microarrays were washed and dried. The fluorescently labeled microarrays were then subsequently scanned using a confocal laser ScanArray 3000 (General Scanning Inc.) system. Data was collected using ImaGene software (BioDiscovery Inc.). The following strains were used: TM141 (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3) and TM233 (MATα ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 hog1::TRP1). Cells were grown in YEPD (10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l peptone, and 20 g/l dextrose) at 28 °C to an optical density of 0.7 and then subjected to a brief saline shock. RNA was obtained from untreated cells or cells treated with 0.4 mNaCl or 0.8 m NaCl for 10 min and 20 min, respectively. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 7000 rpm, and total RNA was extracted by using hot phenol and glass beads as described (27.Köhrer K. Dombey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA with an mRNA isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) based on biotin-labeled oligo(dT) probes and streptavidin bound to magnetic particles. Purification was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified poly(A)+ RNA appeared undegraded on an agarose gel. Ribosomal bands were substantially reduced, and the final poly(A)+ RNA yield was approximately 1.5% of the total RNA. Before cDNA synthesis, RNAs were tested by Northern blot using specific probes. Fluorescently labeled cDNA was prepared from poly (A)+ RNA by oligo dT-primed polymerization using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (LTI, Gaithersburg, Md). The pool of nucleotides in the labeling reaction was 0.5 mm dGTP, dATP, and dTTP and 0.04 mm dCTP and Cy3-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.5 mm. Probes were purified using Qiagen (Valencia, CA), Qiaquick polymerase chain reaction purifications kits. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (20 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on 0.7% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) under vacuum. Membranes were hybridized at 65 °C in the presence of hybridization buffer (700 mm NaCl, 40 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.6, 4 mm EDTA, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% Ficoll, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) and 106cpm/ml appropriate 32P-labeled DNA fragment. DNA fragments containing the entire ORF of the following genes were used as probes:SLT1 (1.7 kbp), GLK1 (1.5 kbp), GSY2(2.1 kbp), YDR057w (1.6 kbp), RPS10B (0.7 kbp),RPL28A (0.95 kbp), and CTT1 (1.7 kbp). Probes were labeled using the random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Filters were washed in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Transcriptional gene induction has been recognized as an important mechanism for adaptation of yeast cells to saline stress. We have performed a DNA microarray analysis of the global transcriptional response of the yeast genome under NaCl stress. Because of the very large amount of information generated, only the most relevant aspects will be presented in this report, although the whole set of data generated from this work can be retrieved from the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona web site. Our results revealed that expression of a quite large number of genes increased after a short exposure (10 min) to a relatively low concentration of NaCl (0.4 m). As shown in Table I, the mRNA level of more than 1300 genes increased at least 3-fold under these conditions. In some cases the increase was rather dramatic, with a ratio of expression between stressed and non-stressed conditions higher than 10 (these genes are denoted as very highly induced genes). Interestingly, exposure of the cells for a longer period (20 min) reduced the number of responsive genes by a factor of about 10-fold. When cells were exposed for 10 min to a higher NaCl concentration (0.8 m), the number of genes with at least a 3-fold increase in its mRNA level was much lower (about 400). However, the number of responsive genes doubled when cells were stressed for 20 min. This figures clearly indicate that, at the genome level, time of exposure to NaCl and the concentration of salt used markedly affect the results obtained.Table IGlobal overview of changes in expression of yeast genes after exposure of cells to NaClLevel of inductionNo. of Genes0.4 m[NaCl]0.8 m [NaCl]10 min20 min10 min20 minVHI (>10-fold)105 (7.7%)11 (6.4%)12 (3.1%)69 (9.4%)HI (5–10-fold)356 (26.2%)41 (22.8%)95 (24.2%)152 (20.7%)MI (3–5-fold)898 (66.1%)120 (69.8%)285 (72.7%)514 (69.9%)Number of induced genes1359172392735Data obtained from genomic chips was analyzed, and genes showing an increase in expression higher than 3-fold after saline stress were grouped within three classes: very highly induced (VHI), highly induced (HI), and moderately induced (MI). Figures in parentheses denote the percentage of each class with respect of the total number of scored genes. Open table in a new tab Data obtained from genomic chips was analyzed, and genes showing an increase in expression higher than 3-fold after saline stress were grouped within three classes: very highly induced (VHI), highly induced (HI), and moderately induced (MI). Figures in parentheses denote the percentage of each class with respect of the total number of scored genes. One of the most interesting aspects derived from our data is that at 0.4 m NaCl, a concentration of salt widely used to test responses to osmotic shock, the transcriptional response is rather early and largely transient. As shown in TableII, about 93% of the induced genes shows an early response. We consider here early response genes whose signal increases at least 3-fold after 10 min of stress and is at least 80% of the signal at 20 min. Among them, about 85% display a transient response, defined as the case in which the level of expression at 10 min at least doubles the level of expression at 20 min. This implies that many transcriptional responses, when tested at the mRNA level, could be missed if cells are exposed for too long to stress. This situation is reflected in Fig. 1. Genes were listed on the basis of their increase in expression under a stress of 0.4 m NaCl for 10 min. The top 50 genes were selected, and their induction levels at 0.4 m and 0.8 mNaCl (after exposure of the cells for 10 and 20 min) were plotted. As can be observed, many genes that showed a strong increase in expression after 10 min at 0.4 m sharply decreased after 20 min. Fig.1 also presents another interesting fact. Most of the genes that are highly induced after 10 min at 0.4 m NaCl remain almost silent when cells are challenged with 0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 1,left panel). However, in many cases, a strong response is triggered after 20 min of exposure to high NaCl concentration (Fig. 1,right panel). This observation indicates that exposure to a high concentration of salt results in a delayed transcriptional response. A similar conclusion has been recently reached regarding the kinetics of induction of the gene GPD1, a key player in the response to osmotic stress in yeast (28.Rep M. Albertyn J. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Hohmann S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our data indicates that this delayed response affects most genes that are induced at high salinity, as it can be deduced from the observation that a majority of these genes (about 62%) showed a response that can be defined as moderately late or late, whereas in cells treated with 0.4 m NaCl this behavior is observed in less than 7% of the induced genes (TableII).Table IITiming of the transcriptional response of yeast genes to saline stressResponseNo. of Genes0.4 m[NaCl]0.8 m [NaCl]Early1330 (93.2%)332 (38.2%) Transient112763 Sustained203269Moderately late75 (5.3%)463 (53.2%)Late22 (1.5%)75 (8.6%)Total number1427870Induction level of genes showing at least a 3-fold increase in mRNA after saline stress was scored, and the response was classified with respect the ratio of induction at 10 and 20 min (R 10/20) as follows: early transient (R 10/20 > 2), early sustained (0.8 <R 10/20 < 2), moderately late (0.2 <R 10/20 < 0.8), and late (R 10/20< 0.2).

Figures in parentheses denote the percentage of each class with respect of the total number of scored genes. In conclusion, evaluation of transcriptional responses after saline stress must take into account the timing of the response. For instance, a recent survey (29.Planta R.J. Brown A.J. Cadahia J.L. Cerdán M.E de Jonge M. Gent M.E. Hayes A. Kolen C.P. Lombardia L.J. Sefton M. Oliver S.G. Thevelein J. Tournu H. van Delft Y.J. Verbart D.J. Winderickx J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 329-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) of the transcriptional response of 250 novel yeast genes from chromosome XIV after exposure of cells to 0.7 mNaCl for 1 h revealed only five regulated genes (YNL274c, YNL195c, YNL194c,YNL066c and YNL051w). Our screening also revealed three of them (YNL274c, YNL195c, andYNL066c) as increased at least 3-fold, but in addition, 27 more genes were identified as regulated after a 20-min exposure to 0.8m NaCl. In light of our data, it seems reasonable to assume that the observed difference is the result of the fact that, after 1 h of exposure, most of the genomic transcriptional response vanished. Quite a few genes ranking in the very highly induced and highly induced categories after exposure to 0.4 m NaCl for 10 min do not have a recognized functional role, and for many of them, the response described here represents the first clue on functional data available. In other cases, increases in the mRNA level after salt stress had been previously documented, indicating that the data generated by the genomic chip analysis was reliable and can be safely compared with reported data. As far as we could detect, the CTT1 gene was the only one not showing the expected behavior, since no induction was detected from the microarray hybridization experiments (despite the strong induction observed in our preliminary Northern blot experiments). Subsequent analysis showed that this specific target was among the few that failed to amplify or purify, and therefore, no signal could be expected. Table III presents a list of highly induced genes after exposure to 0.4 m NaCl for 10 min that can be ascribed to known functional families. Genes encoding proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism are well represented. As mentioned above, synthesis of glycerol is a major response of yeast cells to osmotic stress (see Ref. 30.Nevoigt E. Stahl U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a review). In addition to the well characterized genes GPD1 and GPD2, responsible for the synthesis of glycerol, we have detected a strong increase in expression in a number of genes encoding plasma membrane sugar transporters, such as STL1, HXT10,HXT7, and HXT5. Of particular interest isSTL1, a gene encoding a putative hexose transporter still to be functionally characterized (31.Zhao S. Douglas N.W. Heine M.J. Williams G.M. Winther-Larsen H.C. Meaden P.G. Gene. 1994; 146: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This gene shows the strongest induction after 10 min at 0.4 m NaCl, whereas after 20 min its mRNA level has declined to reach almost basal levels. Genes encoding glucose-phosphorylating enzymes, such as GLK1 and the related ORF YDR516c, as well as HXK2 were also strongly induced.Table IIIClassification into functional families of ORFs whose

A notable example of this phenomenon is encountered in advanced gliomas, where homozygous deletions at 10q23 are commonly detected (1.Bigner S. Mark J. Burger P. Mahaley M. Bullard D. Muhlbaier L. Bigner D. Cancer Res. 1998; 48: 405-411Google Scholar). Loss of heterozygosity at an identical chromosomal site is also observed in Cowden's and Bannayan-Zonana syndromes, two autosomal dominant diseases that result in a predisposition to formation of a variety of malignant tumors (2.Eng C. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 701-710PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these genetic data suggested that a tumor suppressor was likely to be localized at 10q23, and the isolation from this chromosomal region of a gene encoding a phosphatase termed PTEN/MMAC has lent strong support to this idea (3.Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. Mccombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R.

For example, examination of glial, prostate, and endometrial tumors revealed that a high percentage of these cancers contained homozygously mutated PTEN/MMAC loci (6.Cairns P. Okami K. Halachmi S.

In addition, in vitro analyses of the potential of PTEN/MMAC as a cell growth regulator demonstrated that overexpression of the catalytically active protein in cells that lacked the phosphatase suppressed cell proliferation (9.Cheney I.W.

Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that mice with heterozygous deletions of the PTEN/MMAC gene show gastrointestinal and prostatic hyperplasia/dysplasia as well as a predilection for the development of colon carcinomas that show loss of heterozygosity of the PTEN/MMAC locus (14.Dicristofano A.

These results are consistent with the suggestion that PTEN/MMAC is an important tumor suppressor in various human malignancies. Although initial studies suggested that the PTEN/MMAC phosphatase acted upon protein substrates and might be involved with the control of integrin-mediated adhesion (4.Li D.M. Sun H.

This phospholipid is a product of the catalytic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and it is involved with a number of signaling pathways, including the activation of the protooncogeneAKT/PKB (21.Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). AKT/PKB is a pleckstrin homology domain-containing serine/threonine kinase with a variety of downstream targets and effects, including the suppression of apoptosis (22.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have demonstrated that the loss of PTEN/MMAC results in increased levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3phospholipid, enhanced AKT/PKB kinase activation, and resistance to apoptosis. For example, murine embryonic fibroblasts with homozygous deletions of the PTEN/MMAC locus were extraordinarily resistant to ultraviolet irradiation as well as other inducers of cell death (23.Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). These cell lines also had increased levels of AKT/PKB kinase activity, and both resistance to apoptosis as well as AKT/PKB kinase activity could be controlled by expression of exogenous PTEN/MMAC. In addition, human tumor-derived cell lines missing PTEN/MMAC also showed enhanced AKT/PKB activity and resistance to apoptosis (24.Haas-Kogan D. Shalev N. Wong M. Mills G. Yount G. Stokoe D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1195-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Whang Y.E. Wu X. Suzuki H. Reiter R.E. Tran C. Vessella R.L. Said J.W. Isaacs W.B. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It is thus likely that the loss of the PTEN/MMAC phosphatase endows tumors with selective growth and survival advantages under stressful conditions such as radiation or chemotherapy. Although recent crystallographic studies of PTEN/MMAC (27.Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) have suggested a C2 domain-mediated mechanism for phospholipid interaction, an unresolved issue concerning PTEN/MMAC is whether this protein is brought into membranous subcellular sites that are involved with the regulation of cell survival. Here we describe a PDZ domain-mediated association between PTEN/MMAC and MAGI3, a novel protein related to a family of multi-PDZ domain-containing, membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) that are localized to epithelial cell tight junctions. This PDZ-mediated interaction allows for enhanced regulation of the AKT/PKB kinase by PTEN/MMAC, presumably by juxtaposing the phosphatase near to the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phospholipid substrate that activates the kinase. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MAGI3 serves to position the PTEN/MMAC phosphatase to specific subcellular locations that are involved with the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. In order to identify proteins that interact with PTEN/MMAC, a catalytically inactive form of the phosphatase was fused after the DNA-binding domain of lexA. A human fetal brain cDNA library was screened usingCLONTECH's MATCHMAKER lexA two-hybrid system, and positive clones were isolated and sequenced. Full-lengthMAGI3 was isolated by screening a fetal brain cDNA library with a radioactively labeled probe derived from the yeast two-hybrid positives. In order to map the specific PDZ domain of MAGI3 that interacts with PTEN/MMAC, the individual PDZ domains were fused after the activation domain and tested in the two-hybrid system. Carboxyl-terminal regions of BAI-1 and the NMDA 2B receptor were cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted after the activation domain. Mutants lacking the carboxyl-terminal PDZ-binding sites were produced by PCR. In vitro analysis of the MAGI3 and PTEN protein interaction was performed using the TnT rabbit reticulocyte transcription/translation system (Promega) and affinity-purified GST fusion proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One microgram of plasmid was translated in the reticulocyte system in a total volume of 0.025 ml. Samples were diluted into 0.5 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). GST fusion proteins were then added and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with shaking. The GSH-Sepharose 4b resin (0.03 ml) was added and incubated for an additional 30 min. The samples were washed 4 times in binding buffer, loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX), and dried for exposure to a PhosphorImager screen (Fuji). For peptide inhibition studies, synthetic peptides were added to the diluted lysates prior to GST fusion protein addition. Where indicated, positive control antibodies were used in place of GST fusion proteins with the same binding buffer conditions. PTEN/MMAC and MAGI3 constructs were transfected into mammalian 293 cells. The transfected cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol. Proteins were co-precipitated as described previously (51.Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brtush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitated PTEN/MMAC was detected using an affinity purified polyclonal anti-PTEN/MMAC antibody directed against a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein. MDCK cells were plated on glass chamber slides and then transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Immunofluorescence was performed 24 h post-transfection. Cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 200 mmsucrose for 10 min. Cells were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Staining was performed for 1 h in 2% BSA in PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. Polyclonal antibodies from guinea pig were generated against GST fused to amino acids 244–295 of MAGI1. The specificity of the antisera was determined by immunoblot analysis of HEK 293 cell extracts from cells that overexpressed V5-tagged MAGI1, MAGI2, or MAGI3. The resulting immunoreactivity was specific and recognized MAGI1 but not MAGI2 or MAGI3. The MAGI1 antibodies were affinity purified prior to use in immunocytochemistry. Antibody reactive against GST was first depleted from the antisera using GST-Sepharose (Pierce). MAGI1-specific antibody was then isolated from the depleted antisera by affinity chromatography using a GST fusion protein containing MAGI1 amino acids 244–295 immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose 4B. The commercial antibodies against ZO-1 (rabbit) and E-cadherin (rat) are from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence are from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. CACO-2 cells were grown on 0.4-μm collagen-coated polycarbonate filters until polarized as determined by resistance measurements. Cells were then fixed in cold methanol for 25 min, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked for 1 h with 10% horse serum in PBS. Cells were then double labeled with anti-MAGI1 (5 μg/ml) and anti-ZO-1 (2.5 μg/ml) diluted in 2% BSA, 0.02% azide, washed with 2% BSA in PBS, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 min, and washed again. The filters were cut out with a razor and mounted on slides with 20 μl of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) in preparation for analysis by immunofluorescent microscopy. Epitope-tagged AKT/PKB and different combinations of PTEN and MAGI3 constructs were transfected into human 293 cells. After 36 h, the cells were lysed using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C for 4 h and then washed twice with lysis buffer, once with 20 mm HEPES buffer, and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl, 10 mm MnCl). The kinase activity was determined using histone H2B as a substrate and32P-labeled ATP. Analysis of the subcellular localization of myristoylated PTEN/MMAC demonstrated that the majority (∼60%) was associated with the membrane fraction, whereas the majority of the non-myristoylated form was cytoplasmic (data not shown). In order to determine the potential mechanism by which PTEN/MMAC is brought into close proximity to subcellular sites involved with survival, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a human fetal brain cDNA library. This resulted in the isolation of a partial protein with significant homology to multi-PDZ domain containing proteins in the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family that includes the neuronal PSD 95 protein, the Discs Large tumor suppressor protein, and the tight junction protein ZO-1 (28.Fanning A.S.

The two-hybrid fragment encoding the novel PTEN/MMAC-binding protein was used to isolate cDNAs containing the full-length sequence that is shown in Fig.1 A. The novel PTEN/MMAC-binding protein contained a domain structure similar to that observed for MAGI and AIP/S-SCAM, with 6 PDZ domains (numbered according to Ref. 33.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N.

Overall, the homology of the structural domains shared between these three proteins is relatively high, whereas the interdomain spacer regions showed lower sequence conservation, and two-hybrid analysis has revealed that the homologous PDZ domains in MAGI1 and AIP/S-SCAM also bind to PTEN in a carboxyl-terminal-dependent manner (data not shown). 2C. Sawyers, personal communication. Because both AIP/S-SCAM and the novel PTEN/MMAC-interacting protein bear significant resemblance to MAGI, we propose to rename these proteins MAGI2, MAGI3, and MAGI1, respectively. Northern analysis of MAGI1 and MAGI2 expression revealed that MAGI1 is widely expressed (31.Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol.

In order to determine the tissue distribution of MAGI3, a sensitive PCR analysis was performed. Fig. 1 B reveals that MAGI3 is widely expressed in various fetal and adult tissues, including a variety of tumors, with only adult skeletal muscle, leukocytes, and spleen and fetal liver and spleen showing low or undetectable transcript levels. Finally, the gene encoding MAGI3 was mapped to chromosomal region 1p21 using a radiation hybrid panel (data not shown).Figure 1Sequence and expression of MAGI3.

Although this short consensus sequence appears in a large number of proteins, it is likely that other more amino-terminal residues are also involved in the specificity of PDZ domain-binding (34.Doyle D.A.

Examination of the PTEN/MMAC sequence revealed that the carboxyl terminus of the protein encoded the sequence TKV, consistent with the involvement of this region in binding to one or more PDZ domains of MAGI3. As shown in Fig. 2, the original two-hybrid clone encompassed PDZ domains 2 and 3 and a portion of domain 4. Yeast two-hybrid mapping studies were thus performed to examine the nature of the PDZ domain that binds to PTEN/MMAC as well as to examine the requirement for the carboxyl-terminal TKV sequence for this interaction. As Fig. 2 illustrates, only PDZ domain 2 interacted specifically with PTEN/MMAC. This figure also shows that, as predicted from a variety of structure-function studies, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal TKV sequence of PTEN/MMAC resulted in a diminished interaction between this protein and the third PDZ domain of MAGI3 in yeast. In order to examine the specificity of PDZ domain binding, other proteins were examined for their ability to interact with the MAGI3 PDZ motifs. Previous data suggested that the carboxyl terminus of a seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor termed BAI-1 interacted with the fourth PDZ domain of MAGI (37.Shiratsuchi T. Oda K. Nishimori H. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because this MAGI2 PDZ domain shows a high degree of sequence conservation with the fourth PDZ domain of MAGI3, we tested for binding of the carboxyl terminus of BAI-1 with the various PDZ domains from MAGI3. Fig. 2 shows that the carboxyl terminus of BAI-1 interacts with the fourth PDZ domain of MAGI3, consistent with results found for MAGI2. Examination of the carboxyl terminus of BAI-1 reveals the PDZ-binding site consensus sequence TEV, and the interaction between PDZ domain 4 and the carboxyl terminus of BAI-1 is decreased when these three residues are deleted (Fig. 2). Finally, the fifth PDZ domain of MAGI3 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the NMDA receptor subunit 2B (Fig. 2), consistent with previous results found for the interaction of this cell surface receptor with the fifth PDZ domain of MAGI2 (33.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). As with PTEN/MMAC and BAI-1, the carboxyl terminus of the NMDA receptor 2B encodes a PDZ-binding site consensus sequence, SDV. These data demonstrate that MAGI3 binds to several proteins, including intracellular and cell surface molecules, and these interactions are mediated by sequence-specific associations between multiple PDZ domains and carboxyl-terminal regions. In vitro interaction experiments were next performed to confirm the yeast two-hybrid studies. Fig.3 A illustrates that GST fusion proteins containing the original two-hybrid-derived MAGI3 fragment (encoding PDZ domains 2, 3, and part of 4) as well as a GST fusion protein containing only PDZ domain 2 were both effective at interacting with PTEN/MMAC in vitro. As predicted from the yeast two-hybrid analysis, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal three amino acids (PTEN-TKV) resulted in a significant decrease in the interactions between the phosphatase and the PDZ domain-containing fusion proteins. In order to determine if the carboxyl terminus was sufficient for binding, peptide inhibition studies were performed (Fig.3 B). This analysis demonstrated that a 20-residue peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of PTEN was capable of inhibiting the in vitro interaction between the third PDZ domain of MAGI3 and the phosphatase, whereas a peptide lacking the carboxyl-terminal 3 residues did not inhibit the interaction. The levels of peptide required to inhibit completely the in vitro interaction were relatively high (μm) suggesting that sequences upstream of the carboxyl-terminal 20 residues of PTEN/MMAC may also be involved with PDZ domain binding. Binding studies using transfected cells were next performed to examine the interaction between PTEN/MMAC and MAGI3 under more physiological conditions. HEK 293 epithelial cells were transfected with an epitope-tagged form of MAGI3 together with either wild type PTEN/MMAC or PTEN/MMAC lacking the carboxyl-terminal three residues (PTEN-TKV). Fig. 3 C shows that transfection of wild type PTEN/MMAC together with MAGI3 resulted in a complex that could be co-precipitated. As was found in the yeast two-hybrid and in vitro interaction studies, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal three residues resulted in a significant decrease in the in vivointeraction between these two proteins. These binding data support the conclusion that PTEN/MMAC and MAGI3 form a physiologically significant complex in transfected cells. Whereas insufficient levels of endogenous MAGI3 and PTEN are found in cells or tissues for co-precipitation studies, Sawyers and colleagues2 have demonstrated co-precipitation of PTEN with endogenous MAGI2 in brain extracts. Thus far, all MAGUKs have been found to be associated with the cell surface. This includes, for example, the localization of PSD 95, as well as other post-synaptic density MAGUKs, with clusters of cell surface ion channels and the association of the Discs Large and ZO-1 proteins with the tight junctional complexes found at epithelial cell borders (30.Craven S.A. Bredt D. Cell. 1998; 93: 495-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 38.Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J.

Park S. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of MAGI3 was thus investigated by expressing a green fluorescent protein-tagged form of the protein in MDCK epithelial cells, since these cells form a single cell layer-thick epithelial sheet with distinctive tight junctions. Fig.4 A illustrates that, as expected, the endogenous ZO-1 MAGUK is predominantly localized to these tight junctional cell to cell contact sites (38.Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). This figure also shows that MAGI3 is found to be predominantly localized at the tight junctions and appears to partially co-localize with ZO-I at these sites. These studies demonstrate that MAGI3, like other MAGUKs, localizes to a specific cell surface domain of epithelial cells. Although the examination of the subcellular localization of endogenous MAGI3 is important, we have been unable to find cell lines or tissues where this protein is expressed at detectable levels. However, screening of various cell lines for expression of MAGI1, a MAGUK that is closely related to MAGI3 and which binds to PTEN/MMAC in an identical manner (data not shown), revealed high levels of expression in a CACO-2 colon carcinoma cell line. Importantly, Fig. 4 Billustrates that endogenous MAGI1 co-localizes with endogenous ZO-1 to the apical tight junctions of CACO-2 colon carcinoma epithelial cells. Together, these data demonstrate that MAGI-type MAGUKS are cell surface localized proteins that are targeted to epithelial cell tight junctions. Examination of tumor-derived mutations of the PTEN/MMAC locus has demonstrated a number of changes that affect the carboxyl terminus. Notably, several glioblastomas and endometrial tumors contain mutations in exons 8 and 9 that result in truncated proteins that lack between 19 and ∼60 carboxyl-terminal residues as well as an extended protein due to mutation of the stop codon (41.Eng C. Peacocke M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 42.Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 1234-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As demonstrated here, these deletions would result in a loss of the PDZ domain-binding site, and these tumor-derived PTEN/MMAC mutants would thus not efficiently associate with MAGI3. In addition, some of these mutations result in changes in PTEN/MMAC protein stability as well (43.Georgescu M. Kirsch K. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), although removal of the carboxyl-terminal 3 residue PDZ-binding site clearly does not affect protein expression levels (Fig. 3 C). An accumulating body of evidence suggests that a major role for PTEN/MMAC is the control of plasma membrane-associated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and downstream AKT/PKB kinase activity (12.Li J. Simpson L. Takahashi M. Miliaresis C. Myers M. Tonks N. Parsons R. Cancer Res. 1998; 56: 5667-5672Google Scholar, 19.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 15587-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). If association between PTEN/MMAC and MAGI3 is involved with the control of AKT/PKB, then the efficiency of kinase regulation by the phosphatase should be enhanced by co-expression of the PDZ domain-containing protein with the phosphatase. In order to test this hypothesis, very low levels of PTEN/MMAC were expressed either with or without MAGI3, and the effects on AKT/PKB kinase activity were examined. Fig.5 A illustrates that the regulation of AKT/PKB kinase by PTEN/MMAC is significantly enhanced in the presence of MAGI3. Thus, the ability of the AKT/PKB kinase to phosphorylate histone H2B is decreased when both PTEN/MMAC and MAGI3 are co-transfected together, suggesting that PTEN/MMAC more efficiently dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 when it associates with the membrane-associated protein MAGI3. Importantly, this figure also illustrates that this enhancement requires a PDZ domain-mediated interaction, since the mutant form of PTEN/MMAC missing the carboxyl-terminal 3-amino acid PDZ-binding site is no longer able to regulate AKT/PKB activity in the presence of MAGI3. It should be noted that the enhancement effect of MAGI3 on the ability of PTEN/MMAC to regulate AKT/PKB kinase activity is less important when higher levels of PTEN/MMAC are expressed in transfected cells, suggesting that elevated levels of enzyme expression obviate the requirement for this type of membrane localization mechanism, at least in heterologous systems (data not shown). The simplest interpretation of these results is that membrane-localized MAGI3 brings the phosphatase in close proximity to the cell surface to allow for efficient phospholipid dephosphorylation. In order to test this hypothesis, PTEN/MMAC was artificially targeted to the plasma membrane by the incorporation of an amino-terminal myristoylation site derived from p60src. Fig. 5 B illustrates that localization of PTEN/MMAC to the plasma membrane by amino-terminal myristoylation results in an enhanced ability to down-regulate AKT/PKB kinase activity, consistent with the suggestion that plasma membrane localization is critical for efficient PTEN/MMAC PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity. Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that MAGI3 serves to bring PTEN/MMAC into close proximity to membrane phospholipid substrates in order to regulate downstream AKT/PKB kinase activity. The catalytic activity of PTEN/MMAC appears to be a critical component of tumor suppression, and the control of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3levels by this enzyme is likely to have important effects on the survival and proliferation of tumors (12.Li J. Simpson L. Takahashi M. Miliaresis C. Myers M. Tonks N. Parsons R. Cancer Res. 1998; 56: 5667-5672Google Scholar, 19.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

It is therefore of significant interest that the interaction of this enzyme with a specific PDZ domain of a membrane-associated MAGUK is involved with subcellular localization of the phosphatase and the regulation of the AKT/PKB kinase. MAGUKs and other multi-PDZ domain-containing proteins have been previously implicated in a diversity of cell signaling pathways. For example, the Drosophila Discs Large MAGUK is located at epithelial cell tight junctions, and mutations in either the guanylate kinase or SH3 domains were found to mislocalize this protein and result in lethal embryonic tumors with disrupted adherens junctions (40.Hough C.D. Woods D.F. Park S. Bryant P.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44.Goode S. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2532-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, a complex of PDZ domain-containing proteins, including one MAGUK, is involved with the appropriate apical localization of the LET 23 tyrosine kinase receptor that induces Caenorhabditis elegans vulval development (45.Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Finally, the multi-PDZ domain-containing protein INAD assembles the various components of the Drosophila visual system in close proximity to allow for increased efficiency of signal transduction (46.Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The results reported here suggest that MAGI3 performs a similar critical role by bringing PTEN/MMAC in close proximity to cell surface phospholipid signaling pathways at subcellular sites such as the tight junctions. The present results, as well as other studies, also suggest that MAGIs assemble a diversity of PDZ domain interacting proteins into a cell surface complex. For MAGI2 and 3, this complex includes membrane associating factors such as GKAP/SAPAP SAPAP (47.Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (data not shown), G-coupled receptors such as BAI-1 (37.Shiratsuchi T. Oda K. Nishimori H. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and ion channels such as the NMDA receptor (33.Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N.

The inclusion of PTEN/MMAC into such a multi-component “signalosome” complex suggests that this phosphatase may be implicated in a diversity of pathways including those involved with angiogenesis (37.Shiratsuchi T. Oda K. Nishimori H. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and excitatory neuron function (48.Ikonomidou C. Bosch F. Miksa M. Bittigau P. Vockler J. Dikranian K. Tenkova T. Stefovska V. Turski L. Olney J. Science. 1998; 283: 70-74Crossref Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). It is likely that this complex will become more intricate as the binding partners for the other domains of MAGI3 are identified. Interestingly, the interaction between PTEN/MMAC and MAGI3 might provide for a mechanism to regulate the ability of the phosphatase to modulate AKT/PKB kinase activity. For example, the interaction between PTEN/MMAC and MAGI3 could be modulated by phosphorylation of the threonine residue contained within the carboxyl-terminal PDZ recognition site. Importantly, a recent report has demonstrated that the AKT/PKB survival kinase is found at the identical tight junctional location in epithelial cells as the MAGI3-PTEN·MMAC complex, consistent with the hypothesis that this signaling complex is located at a specific subcellular site involved with the regulation of cell survival (49.Watton S. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, another recent study has clearly demonstrated the importance of E-cadherin, another cell junction protein, in the regulation of the activity of the AKT/PKB survival kinase (50.Pece S. Chiarello M. Murga C. Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results reported here describe a novel mechanism for the localization of a critical intracellular tumor suppressor to a multicomponent signaling complex at epithelial cell-cell junctions.

Intracellular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are key elements of the signal transduction pathways of many TNF receptor family members, including CD40. We show for the first time that engagement of CD40 in intact B cells induces the rapid translocation of TRAF2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. We found that CD40 engagement also results in its recruitment, together with TRAF2 and TRAF3, to membrane microdomains, regions of the plasma membrane enriched in signaling molecules such as the Src family kinases. Using a membrane-permeable chelator of zinc or a mutant TRAF2 molecule, we show that the putative zinc-binding domains of TRAFs contribute to their recruitment to microdomains and to the downstream activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. We suggest that the zinc RING and zinc finger domains of TRAFs are required for communication between CD40 and microdomain-associated signaling molecules and may serve a similar role in the signal transduction pathways of other TNF receptor family members.

Understanding the roles of TRAF proteins in CD40 signaling requires careful characterization of the molecular interactions between CD40 and TRAF proteins. It has been suggested that TRAF2 is bound to CD40 in unstimulated B cells and is released into the cytoplasm upon CD40 ligation (11.Chaudhuri A. Orme S. Eilam S. Cherayil B.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4244-4251PubMed Google Scholar). However, using similar techniques, others have concluded that TRAFs are recruited to CD40 during signaling (12.Kuhné M.R. Robbins M. Hambor J.E. Mackey M.F. Kosaka Y. Nishimura T. Gigley J.P. Noelle R.J. Calderhead D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To address the issue of subcellular localization in intact cells, we stably transfected a mouse B cell line with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled TRAF2. Using confocal microscopy, we found that TRAF2 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells and is recruited to the plasma membrane only following CD40 engagement with membrane-bound CD154 or anti-CD40 antibody. Remarkably, we also found that CD154 stimulation of B cells renders CD40, TRAF2, and TRAF3 largely insoluble in non-ionic detergents. Recent reports have described the association of important signaling molecules in lymphocytes with low density, detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains (13.Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J.

Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). Using density gradient centrifugation, we demonstrate that CD40 engagement results in the rapid, dramatic recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF3 to these specialized regions of the plasma membrane. In addition, we found that a mutant TRAF2 molecule containing a deletion in its zinc-binding domain displayed reduced raft recruitment, as did wild-type TRAF2 and TRAF3 in cells treated with a membrane-permeable chelator of zinc. Zinc chelation also blocked CD40-mediated JNK activation, but not the activation of JNK by osmotic stress. Taken together, these findings suggest that the zinc-binding domains of TRAFs mediate interactions with raft components critical for downstream signaling events. To construct human TRAF2 with an amino-terminal GFP tag, TRAF2 cDNA was ligated into the pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The insert encoding TRAF2-GFP was subcloned into the inducible expression vector pOPRSVI.mcs1 (18.Busch L.K. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar), generating pTRAF2-GFP. LacR-binding sites in the Rous sarcoma virus promoter of this construct allow for the negative regulation of protein production by LacR. pEFLac encoding LacR has been described (19.Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF2ΔZn (amino acids 199–501 of mouse TRAF2) was produced by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and placed into pOPRSVI.mcs1. The mouse B cell lines M12.4.1 and CH12.LX and transfectants expressing various hCD40 molecules have been described (20.Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J.

M12.LacR was stably transfected with pTRAF2-GFP to generate M12.TRAF2-GFP. CHO-K1 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Brij 58 was from Pierce, and Nonidet P-40 was from Polysciences, Inc. (Warring, PA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), HRP-labeled cholera toxin B subunit, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) were from Sigma. The 1C10 hybridoma (anti-mCD40, rat IgG2a) (22.Heath A.W. Wu W.W. Howard M.C. Eur.

Eshhar Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1984; 14: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. Thomas Waldschmidt (University of Iowa). The G28-5 (anti-hCD40) hybridoma was from American Type Culture Collection. MOPC-21 (mouse IgG1 isotype control) was from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF6, and Lyn were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For staining hCD40 on Western blots, sheep polyclonal anti-GST-hCD40 (extracellular domain) antibody was prepared by Elmira Biologicals (Iowa City, IA). HRP-labeled secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Lissamine rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rat IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). M12.TRAF2-GFP cells were cultured for 48 h with 100 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce TRAF2-GFP. For staining surface CD40 on unstimulated M12.TRAF2-GFP cells, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice, washed, and then incubated with anti-mCD40 antibody (1C10) and lissamine rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody. For staining CD40 on activated cells, live cells were incubated for 10 min (at 25 or 37 °C) with 10 μg/ml anti-mCD40 antibody and 1:250 lissamine rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. CHO-K1 and CHO-mCD154 cells were stained for 15 min at 37 °C with 330 ng/ml 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). B cells (1 × 106) and DiI-stained CHO cells (2 × 105) were mixed in a final volume of 100 μl, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and then examined by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal system on a Nikon Optiphot microscope, 60× oil immersion objective lens). Cells (107/condition/ml) were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml anti-CD40 antibody (G28-5 or 1C10) or isotype control mAb (MOPC-21 or EM-95) and then pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Brij 58, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 150 mm NaCl with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. After collecting supernatants, the detergent-insoluble pellets were resuspended and briefly sonicated in 200 μl of lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. In some experiments, cells were preincubated in serum-free medium (2 × 106/ml) with 10 μm TPEN, 10 μmBAPTA/AM, or 1:2000 Me2SO for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended to 107/ml, and stimulated as described above. Lysate fractions were diluted 1:2 with reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. To allow better detection of hCD40 on Western blots, lysate samples were deglycosylated prior to SDS-PAGE using peptideN-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used to detect HRP-labeled antibodies on Western blots. M12.4.1 cells (107/condition/ml) were stimulated for various periods of time at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml anti-mCD40 mAb or isotype control mAb and then pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (1% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 15% glycerol, and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol), sonicated briefly (to reduce viscosity), heated (5 min at 95 °C), and subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blotting as described above. Raft isolation was accomplished using a combination of published protocols (15.Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P. Pierres M. He H.T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 24.Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). B cells (2.5 × 107/condition/ml) were stimulated at 37 °C for 10 min using 10 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb or 5 × 106CD154-expressing CHO cells. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with TPEN (as described above) or with MCD. Pretreatment of B cells with MCD was essentially as described (14.Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in serum-free medium, resuspended in serum-free medium containing 22 mg/ml MCD (∼20 mm), incubated for 10 min at room temperature and for 15 min at 37 °C, and then stimulated with anti-hCD40 antibody (as described above). Following stimulation, cells (including CHO-hCD154 stimulators, where used) were pelleted and resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were diluted 1:2 with 70% Nycodenz in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl and transferred to 3-ml ultracentrifuge tubes. Lysates were overlaid with a Nycodenz step gradient (200 μl each of 25, 21.5, 18, 15, and 8% Nycodenz) (24.Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C (Beckman SW 60 rotor). Eleven 200-μl fractions were removed from the tubes, starting at the top (lowest density), and then diluted 1:2 in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples of fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For testing ganglioside GM1 content of density gradient fractions, 2.5 × 107 unstimulated M12.4.1 cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 1 ml of culture medium containing 3.4 μg of HRP-labeled cholera toxin B subunit (or, as controls, untreated cells and cells incubated with an equivalent amount of unconjugated HRP). Cells were then subjected to lysis and density gradient centrifugation as described above. Gradient fractions were assayed for peroxidase activity by mixing 10-μl gradient fractions with 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm citric acid (pH 5.0), 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and 0.012% H2O2. Samples were incubated for ∼5 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of 0.67 m sulfuric acid. Optical density of the samples was read at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. M12.hCD40 cells (2 × 106/ml/condition) were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with 5 μg/ml anti-hCD40 mAb, isotype control mAb, or 0.6m sorbitol. Cell lysates were assayed for JNK activity as described previously (19.Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were incubated (10 min at room temperature and then 10 min at 37 °C) in serum-free medium containing 27.5 mg/ml MCD (∼25 mm) before stimulation. To examine the localization of TRAF2 in intact B cells, we stably transfected M12.LacR cells with a construct encoding an inducibly expressed GFP-tagged TRAF2 molecule or, as a control, inducible GFP. Confocal microscopy revealed that GFP alone was evenly distributed in cells, including the nucleus (Fig.1 A). Incubation of cells with anti-mCD40 antibody and a rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody (10 min at 25 °C) (Fig. 1, A–C) did not affect the distribution of GFP (unstimulated cells not shown). In contrast, TRAF2-GFP was excluded from the nuclei and localized to the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells (fixed and then surface-stained with anti-mCD40 antibody followed by a rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody) (Fig. 1, D–F). In cells stimulated for 10 min at 25 °C with anti-CD40 and rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies, TRAF2-GFP was localized to small patches in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, G–I) and colocalized with CD40 (colocalization in yellow) (Fig.1 I). Recruitment of TRAF2-GFP from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane began immediately upon the addition of anti-CD40 mAb and was essentially complete after 5–10 min. Interestingly, antibody stimulation of cells at 37 °C resulted in significant internalization of CD40 with associated TRAF2 (Fig. 1,J–L). However, internalization appeared minimal when B cells were stimulated at 37 °C for 10 min with membrane-bound CD154 (Fig. 1, M–O). We conclude that in intact B cells, TRAF2 associates with CD40 only following CD40 ligation. Although confocal microscopy indicated that CD40 and TRAF2 associate in activated cells, we were unable to consistently demonstrate this association using conventional co-immunoprecipitation techniques. Previously, however, it was reported that the total amount of TRAF2 that could be immunoprecipitated from stimulated cells was considerably less than that obtained from unstimulated cells (12.Kuhné M.R. Robbins M. Hambor J.E. Mackey M.F. Kosaka Y. Nishimura T. Gigley J.P. Noelle R.J. Calderhead D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was suggested that stimulation resulted in the recruitment of TRAFs to detergent-insoluble complexes or that TRAFs undergo activation-induced degradation. To determine if TRAF2 becomes associated with detergent-insoluble material in activated cells, we examined the effects of CD40 stimulation on a mouse B cell line transfected with hCD40, M12.hCD40 (20.Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with anti-hCD40 mAb and lysed in 1% Brij 58 (a relatively mild, non-ionic detergent), and lysates were centrifuged to pellet detergent-insoluble material. The insoluble material was dissolved in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol so that it could be subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis and compared with samples of the Brij 58-soluble material. On Western blots, the majority of TRAF2 from unstimulated B cells appeared in the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig.2 A). However, in cells stimulated through hCD40 or endogenous mCD40, much of the TRAF2 became associated with the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, a portion of the TRAF2 in the insoluble fraction appeared to be post-translationally modified, resulting in the appearance of multiple high molecular weight forms. To determine if CD40 itself becomes detergent-insoluble in stimulated cells, we generated a polyclonal antiserum for detecting hCD40 on Western blots. In unstimulated cells, a significant fraction of CD40 was already present in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2). Upon stimulation, additional CD40 was recruited to this fraction (Fig. 2 A), although this recruitment was not as dramatic as the activation-induced partitioning of TRAF2 (Fig. 2 A). Association of hCD40 (or TRAF2) with the detergent-insoluble fraction did not occur if the stimulating antibody was instead added post-lysis (data not shown). To determine if the recruitment of CD40 to detergent-insoluble material is dependent upon TRAF association, we repeated the experiment using M12.4.1 cells expressing a mutant hCD40 molecule with a 55-amino acid cytoplasmic deletion (hCD40Δ55) (20.Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). hCD40Δ55 lacks the binding sites for TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 (10.Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N.

Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 26.Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and has no signaling activity (20.Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). As with full-length CD40, engagement of hCD40Δ55 resulted in its recruitment to detergent-insoluble material, indicating that this activation-dependent event does not require TRAF binding (Fig. 2 B). Although engagement of hCD40Δ55 did not mediate recruitment of TRAF2 to the insoluble fraction, engagement of endogenous mCD40 in the same cells induced the transition (Fig.2 B). To test the possibility that TRAF2 may also undergo degradation in activated cells, we stimulated M12.4.1 cells for various periods of time with anti-mCD40 mAb, and then we prepared cell lysates using either 1% Brij 58 lysis buffer or buffer containing 1% SDS to more completely solubilize cellular proteins. With a stimulation period of as little as 1 min, most of the TRAF2 appeared in the Brij 58-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2 C). However, total cellular TRAF2 amounts also decreased with stimulation (Fig. 2 D). We conclude that TRAF2 is recruited to Brij 58-insoluble material and undergoes degradation as a result of CD40 stimulation. T cell receptor ligation induces recruitment of Zap-70, T cell receptor α, CD3ε, and CD3ζ to membrane rafts, which may facilitate their interactions with raft-associated Src family kinases (14.Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 15.Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P. Pierres M. He H.T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Potentially, the stimulation-induced insolubility of CD40 and TRAF2 results from a similar association with low density, detergent-insoluble lipid rafts. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated mouse B cells for 10 min at 37 °C with hCD154-bearing CHO cells, lysed the cells in 1% Brij 58, and fractionated the lysates by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Insoluble membrane rafts are found in the low density portion of the gradient, whereas soluble membrane and cytoplasmic proteins are found in higher density fractions (15.Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P. Pierres M. He H.T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). TRAF2 from unstimulated M12.hCD40 cells was found in the high density fractions (Fig. 3 A). CD40 engagement resulted in a marked shift of TRAF2 into lower density fractions, suggesting an association with membrane rafts. Similar results were obtained using anti-mCD40 or anti-hCD40 antibody or CHO-mCD154 cells as stimuli and in a second mouse B cell line, CH12.LX (data not shown). Preliminary experiments indicate that this recruitment also occurs in normal mouse splenic B cells. Blots were also examined for two additional CD40-binding proteins, TRAF3 and TRAF6, both of which appeared in the high density fractions from unstimulated cells (Fig. 3, B and C). In CD154-stimulated cells, the behavior of TRAF3 was similar to that of TRAF2, whereas there was no detectable association of TRAF6 with membrane rafts. Stimulation of M12.hCD40 cells with hCD154 also induced recruitment of hCD40 to low density fractions, although a small amount of CD40 was found in the low density fractions of unstimulated cells as well (Fig. 3 D). In addition, we confirmed that TRAF2-GFP was recruited to low density membrane rafts in CD40-stimulated cells (data not shown) and that the raft recruitment of TRAF2 also occurred at 25 °C (Fig. 3, E and F). To examine the localization of a known constituent of membrane rafts, Western blots were reprobed for Lyn (Fig. 3 G). As expected based upon previous reports (27.Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Lyn localized to low density fractions. Lyn distribution was similar in unstimulated cells (data not shown). The ganglioside GM1 has also been reported to be enriched in membrane microdomains (28.Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). To test density fractions for GM1 content, cells were incubated with cholera toxin (which binds GM1) conjugated to HRP, washed, and then subjected to lysis and density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 3 H, peroxidase activity was detected in all fractions, but was considerably enriched in the low density material. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that CD40, TRAF2, and TRAF3 are recruited to membrane rafts in activated B lymphocytes. It has been reported that cholesterol-binding agents such as MCD can disrupt membrane microdomains (29.Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Treatment of live cells with MCD disrupts T cell receptor-mediated Ca2+ fluxes, and it has been argued that this type of experiment demonstrates the importance of membrane microdomains in T cell receptor signaling (14.Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 30.Yashiro-Ohtani Y. Zhou X.-Y. Toyo-oka K. Tai X.-G. Park C.-S. Hamaoka T. Abe R. Miyake K. Fujiwara H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, we found that MCD treatment, while rendering >10% of B cells permeable to trypan blue (data not shown), only partially disrupted membrane rafts. As shown in Fig. 4 A, MCD treatment of M12.hCD40 cells dissociated only a portion of Lyn from low density, Brij 58-insoluble complexes. A previous report similarly demonstrated that MCD was not able to entirely dissociate Fyn (another Src family kinase) from detergent-insoluble complexes, and it was suggested that MCD may only inefficiently extract cholesterol from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (29.Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). We also found that the raft association of TRAF2 in CD40-stimulated cells (Fig. 4 B) was only partially disrupted by MCD. However, the combination of MCD treatment and lysis in a stronger detergent solution (1% Triton X-100) did lead to more complete dissociation of membrane microdomains (Fig. 4 C). We next examined the effects of MCD on the activation of JNK, an enzyme rapidly activated by CD40 stimulation. In addition to its inability to fully disrupt membrane microdomains (unless combined with a sufficiently strong detergent), MCD treatment, by itself, activated JNK (Fig. 4 D). MCD treatment appeared not to specifically inhibit JNK activation mediated by CD40 (Fig.4 D), but it is difficult to know if there was a partial inhibition masked by the MCD-induced activation of JNK or if MCD was unable to sufficiently disrupt raft complexes involved in CD40 signaling. Taken together, our results indicate it would be inappropriate to draw firm conclusions from CD40 signaling experiments performed using MCD-treated cells. In addition to its carboxyl-terminal receptor (CD40)-binding domain, TRAF2 contains amino-terminal zinc RING and zinc finger motifs (31.Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Although the functions of these putative zinc-binding domains are unclear, similar domains in other proteins can mediate protein-protein interactions (32.Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Mice transgenic for a mutant TRAF2 molecule lacking the zinc RING domain (33.Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) display defective activation of JNK by TNF receptor family members, including CD40. These results and the mutational analysis of TRAF2 (34.Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the zinc-binding features of TRAFs are important for interactions with downstream signaling molecules. In support of this hypothesis, we found that TPEN, a membrane-permeable chelator of zinc (35.Arslan P. Di Virgilio F. Beltrame M. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2719-2727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), abrogated the CD40-mediated activation of JNK (Fig.5 A), but did not inhibit the activation of JNK by osmotic stress (sorbitol). A cell-permeable chelator of Ca2+, BAPTA/AM, did not specifically inhibit the activation of JNK by CD40, indicating that the action of TPEN is not due to its low affinity for Ca2+. Although TPEN may affect other steps in the CD40 signal transduction pathway, its primary effects appear to be on TRAF function. Zinc chelation abolished the activation-induced post-translational modification of TRAF2 and significantly inhibited the recruitment of TRAF2 (Fig. 5 B), but not CD40 (data not shown), to raft complexes. Similarly, a mutant TRAF2 molecule in which we deleted most of the zinc-binding domain (TRAF2ΔZn) displayed reduced recruitment to membrane rafts (Fig.5 C). Importantly, TPEN treatment did not further reduce recruitment of TRAF2ΔZn to membrane rafts, indicating that zinc chelation does not interfere with the binding of the TRAF domain of TRAF2 to the cytoplasmic domain of CD40. Together, these results suggest the zinc-binding features of TRAF2 interact with membrane raft-associated molecules and that these interactions are required for downstream signaling events. Further support for this hypothesis is presented in Fig. 6. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD40 antibody and then solubilized in 1% Brij 58 or lysis buffer in which Brij 58 was replaced with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Although Nonidet P-40 was able to entirely solubilize CD40, a significant proportion of the TRAF2 and TRAF3 from stimulated cells remained in the detergent-insoluble material, indicating that TRAFs may bind a Nonidet P-40-insoluble microdomain component. Pretreatment of cells with TPEN abolished CD40-stimulated recruitment of TRAFs to the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction, demonstrating that the zinc-binding domains of TRAFs are critical for their association with the insoluble fraction.Figure 6Dissociation of CD40, but not TRAFs, from membrane microdomains by 0.5% Nonidet P-40. M12.hCD40 cells were stimulated with anti-hCD40 antibody (+) or an isotype control mAb (−) and then lysed in buffer containing either 1% Brij 58 or 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40). Detergent-soluble (Sol.) and -insoluble (Ins.) fractions were isolated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for TRAF2, TRAF3, and hCD40.DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown that engagement of CD40 results in the rapid recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF3 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where they associate with membrane rafts. CD40 stimulation also induces the association of CD40 itself with membrane rafts, but its recruitment does not appear to be TRAF-dependent. TRAF6 has also been characterized as a CD40-binding protein, yet in contrast to TRAF2 and TRAF3, it showed little if any raft recruitment during stimulation of B cells. However, it remains possible that TRAF6 is recruited only after prolonged stimulation or at low but functionally significant levels. Although the functions of the TRAF proteins remain enigmatic, they appear to serve as adapter molecules linking CD40 to important components of its signaling pathway. Previous work indicates that the zinc RING and zinc fingers of TRAF2 are not required for its binding to CD40 (7.Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 26.Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, we found that disrupting the function of the zinc-binding domains (with TPEN or by mutation) partially inhibited the raft recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF3, suggesting that raft-associated molecules (in addition to CD40) contribute to the avidity of TRAF-microdomain interactions. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the CD40 from activated cells was completely solubilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, whereas the same detergent only partially solubilized TRAF2 and TRAF3. Although our results indicate that TRAF2 and TRAF3 may associate with membrane raft constituents, these molecules remain to be identified. Recently, putative TRAF-interacting proteins have been identified, including apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (36.Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), nuclear factor κB-inducing kinase (37.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), germinal center kinase (38.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and MEKK1, which, unlike the other kinases, may interact with the zinc-binding features of TRAF2 (39.Baud V. Liu Z.-G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). However, the interactions of these kinases with TRAFs have been almost exclusively demonstrated in epithelial cell lines overexpressing transiently transfected TRAFs and candidate molecules. Using commercial antisera, we have been unable to detect the endogenous forms of these putative TRAF-interacting molecules in detergent-insoluble TRAF-containing fractions from CD40-stimulated B cells. Further work is necessary to determine if there are very low levels of these kinases present in the CD40 signal transduction complex or if other proteins (perhaps related to the candidates previously identified) mediate CD40 signaling in B cells. Interestingly, one raft-associated kinase, Lyn, has been postulated to participate in CD40 signaling (40.Ren C.L. Morio T. Fu S.M. Geha R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 41.Faris M. Gaskin F. Parsons J.T. Fu S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although there is currently no evidence that it directly interacts with any of the TRAF molecules. One key to identifying TRAF-interacting molecules in membrane microdomains may be the post-translational modification displayed by raft-associated TRAFs (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). The modification appears to require the zinc-binding features of TRAFs in that it is largely ablated by TPEN treatment and is not evident in TRAF2ΔZn. If this modification is important for the binding of raft-associated molecules, such molecules may have been overlooked in previous attempts to identify TRAF-binding partners. Furthermore, the modification may require the activity of raft-associated proteins, and determining the type of modification should facilitate their identification. Interestingly, several zinc RING-containing proteins such as Cbl participate in the ubiquitination of themselves and other proteins, targeting them for degradation (42.Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R84-R87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the activation-induced modification and degradation of TRAF2 we observed, it seems reasonable to suggest that one or more of the zinc RING-containing TRAFs similarly promote ubiquitination and perhaps help to limit the duration of CD40 signaling. We are currently testing this hypothesis. The discovery of raft-associated CD40, TRAF2, and TRAF3 represents a major advance in the understanding of CD40 signal transduction, indicating where and how to look for other molecules that mediate the proximal steps in CD40 signaling. Although our work focuses on the CD40 signal transduction pathway, the results presented here have broad implications for signaling through a variety of related receptors. TRAF molecules interact with several TNF receptor family members, including TNF receptors 1 and 2, CD27, CD30, and RANK (31.Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

We report here, in agreement with previous data, that AngII and PDGF-B-chain homodimer (PDGF-BB) stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R. Both AngII and PDGF-BB stimulated the phosphorylation of PDGFβ-R via the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc to PDGFβ-R. Both PDGF-BB- and AngII-induced phosphorylation of the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex was inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine and Tiron, but not by calcium chelation. However, transactivation of PDGFβ-R by AngII (measured by PDGFβ-R tyrosine phosphorylation) differed significantly from PDGF-BB. Evidence to support different mechanisms of PDGFβ-R phosphorylation includes differences in the time course of PDGFβ-R phosphorylation, differing effects of inhibitors of the endogenous PDGFβ-R tyrosine kinase and Src family tyrosine kinases, differing results when the PDGFβ-R was directly immunoprecipitated (PDGFβ-R-antibody) versuscoimmunoprecipitated (Shc-antibody), and cell fractionation studies that suggested that the Shc·PDGFβ-R complexes phosphorylated by AngII and PDGF-BB were located in separate subcellular compartments.

Kidney Dis. 1993; 22: 745-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The physiological actions of AngII are mediated largely via the AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) (3.Oliverio M.I. Best C.F. Kim H.S. Arendshorst W.J. Smithies O. Coffman T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F515-F520PubMed Google Scholar), which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs share a common basic structure of seven transmembrane helices connected by alternating cytoplasmic and extracellular loops (4.Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). AngII-mediated growth effects in target cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and cardiac myocytes require the rapid activation of several mitogen-activated protein kinases including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) (5.Weber H. Taylor D.S. Molloy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway that leads to ERK1/2 activation upon AngII binding to the AT1R is still incompletely characterized. There is evidence that binding of AngII to the AT1R stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including Shc and GRB-2 prior to activation of members of the Ras family (6.Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation is likely mediated by several tyrosine kinases including Src family tyrosine kinases, JAK2 and PYK2 (7.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 8.Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

Interestingly, certain aspects of the signal transduction pathways induced by AngII resemble those evoked by classic mitogenic growth factors (9.Berk B.C. Alexander R.W. Brock T.A. Gimbrone M.A. Webb Jr., R.C. Science. 1986; 232: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In fact, recent studies show that GPCRs, including the AT1R, transactivate growth factor receptors, which possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, including the EGF receptor (EGF-R) and PDGF receptor (PDGF-R) (10.Linseman D.A.

It has been suggested that the EGF-R and the PDGF-R mediate several of the cellular effects of AngII (8.Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 11.van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

Shibasaki Y. Tanaka Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) showed recently that ERK1/2 activation by AngII was mediated via EGF-R. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of transactivation of the EGF-R by AngII has revealed a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent process that involves the endogenous EGF-R tyrosine kinase (12.Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Masaki H. Maruyama K. Tsutsumi Y. Moriguchi Y. Shibazaki Y. Tanaka Y. Iwasaka T. Inada M. Matsubara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R by AngII in VSMC has been described previously by Linseman (10.Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms for PDGFβ-R phosphorylation remain poorly defined. In the present study, we compared the signaling events involved in AngII-induced PDGFβ-R transactivation with events involved in PDGF-B-chain homodimer (PDGF-BB)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R. We show that AngII stimulates phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R via the adaptor protein Shc more rapidly than PDGF itself and that PDGFβ-R phosphorylation by AngII is not dependent on calcium. Both Shc and PDGFβ-R phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB and AngII were completely abolished by the antioxidants Tiron and N-acetylcysteine. However, phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R by AngII and PDGF-BB occurred via different pathways as shown by different subcellular location and sensitivity to kinase inhibitors. Cell culture media and protein G-agarose were from Life Technologies, Inc. Polyclonal antibody against Shc, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), and polyclonal antibody against PDGFβ-R were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal anti-phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody was from New England Biolabs. Recombinant (human) TNF and recombinant (human) PDGF-BB were from Sigma. BAPTA-AM, AG1296 (PDGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and PP-1 were from Calbiochem. Rat aortic VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of 200–250-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum as described (14.Ishida M. Ishida T. Thomas S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Passages 8–14 at 60–70% confluence were growth arrested by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% serum for 48 h before use. The methods for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis were described previously (15.Schmitz U. Ishida T. Ishida M. Surapisitchat J. Hasham M.I. Pelech S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, growth-arrested VSMC were stimulated with AngII or PDGF-BB as indicated in each experiment. Cells were lysed in Triton/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Triton, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 200 mm benzamidine), scraped off the dish, and centrifuged. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were precleared and incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were collected by incubation with protein G-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed four times with the Triton/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8–12%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with primary antibodies. After washing (Tris-buffered saline, 0.03% Tween 20), the blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies. The membranes were washed and proteins were detected by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To compare phosphorylation of the PDGβ-R by AngII and PDGF-BB, the PDGFβ-R was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates treated with AngII (100 nm) or PDGF-BB (30 ng/ml) for 2 min. Immunoblotting with an antibody against tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins showed phosphorylation of a ∼180-kDa band (Fig.1 A, upper panel) which was identified as the PDGFβ-R by stripping and reprobing with PDGFβ-R antibody (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). Phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R by AngII at 2 min was ∼50% of phosphorylation by PDGF-BB itself. The adaptor protein Shc exists as three isoforms, 66 kDa, 52 kDa, and 46 kDa, and is a likely candidate to mediate cross-talk between the PDGFβ-R and the AT1R by assembling a signal transduction complex at the PDGFβ-R (7.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 10.Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, AngII-induced PDGFβ-R phosphorylation may be studied by coimmunoprecipitation of Shc and the PDGFβ-R. AngII and PDGF-BB both stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of only the 66-kDa isoform of Shc (Fig. 1 B, upper panel), whereas the two smaller Shc isoforms were not involved in PDGFβ-R transactivation in our cell system. Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc was part of a signal transduction complex that included the PDGFβ-R as shown by coimmunoprecipitation of the PDGFβ-R with Shc (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). To determine whether the signaling events induced by AngII and PDGF-BB which cause PDGFβ-R phosphorylation were similar, the time course for tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R was studied. AngII caused a more rapid and transient phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R than did PDGF-BB (Fig. 2). AngII-induced phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R peaked at 1 min (23.4 ± 3.8-fold) and returned to base line after 10 min, when immunoprecipitated with antibody against the PDGFβ-R. A similar increase (24.6 ± 3.4-fold) in PDGFβ-R phosphorylation was observed when coimmunoprecipitated with antibody against Shc (Fig. 2). Thus, it appeared that 50% of the PDGFβ-R phosphorylated in response to AngII was bound to Shc, and 50% was not bound. In contrast, PDGF-BB maximally phosphorylated the PDGFβ-R at 2 min, and phosphorylation was sustained up to 30 min (Fig. 2, and data not shown). Phosphorylation of the 66-kDa isoform of Shc by AngII was also more rapid than phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R (data not shown). Because AngII increases intracellular calcium (16.Balla T. Varnai P. Tian Y. Smith R.D. Endocr. Res. 1998; 24: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17.Dixon B.S. Sharma R.V. Dickerson T. Fortune J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1406-C1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the transactivation of the EGF-R by AngII was reported to be calcium-dependent (12.Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Masaki H. Maruyama K. Tsutsumi Y. Moriguchi Y. Shibazaki Y. Tanaka Y. Iwasaka T. Inada M. Matsubara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we determined the role of calcium in PDGFβ-R phosphorylation. Treatment with BAPTA-AM, a chelator of intracellular calcium, did not alter phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R by either AngII or PDGF-BB when coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody against Shc (Fig. 3,B and C) or when immunoprecipitated with an antibody against PDGFβ-R (Fig. 3 A, upper panel, and 3 B). Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of the 66-kDa Shc isoform was also not significantly inhibited (Fig. 3 C). Activation of ERK1/2 by both AngII and PDGF-BB was also not calcium-dependent in these VSMC (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). BAPTA-AM treatment stimulated ERK1/2 activation to a small extent in control cells. Because chelation of intracellular calcium blocks activation of the MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (18.Cook S.J. Beltman J. Cadwallader K.A. McMahon M. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13309-13319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we presume that activation of ERK1/2 in unstimulated control cells is a consequence of changes in MAP kinase phosphatase-1 activity. As a positive control for calcium chelation, VSMC were also treated with TNF. BAPTA-AM completely inhibited ERK1/2 activation by TNF, confirming that pretreatment with BAPTA-AM inhibits calcium-regulated signaling events (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). It is well known that AngII stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro and in vivo (19.Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 562-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that ROS are required for PDGF-BB-mediated signal transduction (20.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). To determine the role of ROS in AngII-induced Shc·PDGFβ-R phosphorylation, VSMC were preincubated with the antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and Tiron. Both antioxidants completely abolished AngII-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex (Fig. 4). To evaluate the role of the endogenous PDGFβ-R tyrosine kinase in phosphorylation of the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex by AngII, we used tyrphostin AG1296, a potent and specific inhibitor of this kinase (21.Kovlenko M. Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Loubtchenkov M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Bohmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). First, we studied the effect of AG1296 on phosphorylation of PDGFβ-R that was associated with Shc as measured by immunoprecipitation with anti-Shc antibody. At concentrations reported to inhibit PDGF-mediated events (21.Kovlenko M. Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Loubtchenkov M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Bohmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), AG1296 (10 μm) completely inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ-R and Shc induced by PDGF-BB (Fig.5 A). In contrast, AG1296 did not affect AngII-induced phosphorylation of the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex (Fig. 5 A). Second, we studied the effect of AG1296 on total PDGFβ-R phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGFβ-R antibody (Fig. 5 B). Under these experimental conditions, AG1296 caused complete inhibition of the AngII-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R. These results suggest that two different populations of the PDGFβ-R exist, differentiated by whether the PDGFβ-R is bound to the 66-kDa Shc isoform or is not bound. The endogenous PDGFβ-R tyrosine kinase is therefore responsible for phosphorylation of the uncomplexed PDGFβ-R but not for phosphorylation of the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex (Fig.5 B). Previous studies from our laboratory and others showed that the Src tyrosine kinase family is required for AngII- and PDGF-BB-induced signaling events in VSMC, such as cytoskeletal reorganization at focal adhesions (22.Ishida T. Ishida M. Suero J. Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), migration (23.Waltenberger J. Uecker A. Kroll J. Frank H. Mayr U. Bjorge J.D. Fujita D. Gazit A. Hombach V. Levitzki A. Bohmer F.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and proliferation (23.Waltenberger J. Uecker A. Kroll J.

To determine the role of Src in AngII- and PDGF-BB-mediated phosphorylation of the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex, we used PP-1, a pyrazolopyrimidine that interacts specifically with Src family kinases and is a competitive inhibitor of ATP (24.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brisette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). PP-1 did not inhibit AngII-induced phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R (Fig.6, upper panel), nor AngII phosphorylation of Shc (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel). In contrast, PP-1 completely inhibited PDGF-BB-mediated PDGFβ-R phosphorylation and Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 6 A), in agreement with findings of Waltenberger et al. (23.Waltenberger J. Uecker A. Kroll J. Frank H. Mayr U. Bjorge J.D. Fujita D. Gazit A. Hombach V. Levitzki A. Bohmer F.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PP-1 also completely inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFβ-R not bound to Shc that was stimulated by AngII (Fig. 6 B). These results further support the concept that PDGF-BB and AngII activate the PDGFβ-R via two different pathways in VSMC, differentiated by their interaction with Shc. To define further the kinases involved in AngII-mediated Shc·PDGFβ-R complex phosphorylation, we investigated JAK2, which is rapidly activated by AngII (26.Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M.

AG490 also had no effect on AngII-mediated PDGFβ-R phosphorylation measured by Shc coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 7). These data demonstrate that JAK2 activity is not responsible for PDGFβ-R phosphorylation by AngII. A possible explanation for different pathways of Shc·PDGFβ-R complex phosphorylation by AngII and PDGF-BB could be that the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex is localized to a different subcellular compartment when stimulated with AngII. This hypothesis is supported by the findings of Lotti et al. (27.Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), who showed that Shc proteins were localized to endoplasmic reticulum membranes and redistributed after activation of tyrosine kinase receptors. To determine whether separate populations of Shc·PDGFβ-R complexes could be purified, we performed cell fractionation studies. Tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFβ-R was present in the supernatant after centrifugation of lysates at 3,500 ×g for 15 min from cells stimulated with both AngII and PDGF-BB (Fig. 8 A, left panel). In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFβ-R was no longer present in the supernatant of lysates prepared from AngII-stimulated cells after centrifugation at 22,500 ×g for 10 min (Fig. 8 A, right panel). However, when cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB, tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFβ-R was still present in the 22,500 × g supernatant (Fig. 8 A, right panel). To determine the location of Shc after AngII and PDGF-BB stimulation, we dissolved the 22,500 × g pellet in 2% SDS-Triton/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated Shc with an anti-Shc antibody. As shown in Fig. 8 B, the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex was only present in the pellet of cells stimulated with AngII. In PDGF-BB-stimulated lysates only a small amount of Shc was present in the 22,500 × g pellet. These results suggest that the PDGFβ-R phosphorylated in response to AngII (present as a Shc·PDGFβ-R complex) was located in a compartment physically different from the PDGFβ-R phosphorylated in response to PDGF-BB. We measured the relative amounts of caveolin-1 present in the Shc·PDGFβ-R complexes purified from AngII- and PDGF-BB-stimulated cells. Because there was no difference in caveolin-1 coprecipitated (data not shown) we do not believe that translocation to caveolae explains the difference between AngII and PDGF-BB. The major findings of the present study are that AngII and PDGF-BB stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R via different pathways (Fig. 9). Although transactivation of the PDGFβ-R and EGF-R by AngII has been reported previously (10.Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 12.Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Masaki H. Maruyama K. Tsutsumi Y. Moriguchi Y. Shibazaki Y. Tanaka Y. Iwasaka T. Inada M. Matsubara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the novel aspect of the present study is the demonstration of two different pathways that are mechanistically separate as shown by the presence of two populations of the PDGFβ-R. One population of PDGFβ-R exists in which Shc is bound to the receptor in the basal state, whereas in the other population the PDGFβ-R is not complexed to Shc. Evidence to support different mechanisms for PDGFβ-R phosphorylation related to these separate populations includes differences in the time course of PDGFβ-R phosphorylation (Fig. 2), differing effects of inhibitors of the endogenous PDGFβ-R tyrosine kinase and Src family tyrosine kinases (Figs. 4 and 5), differing results when the PDGFβ-R was directly immunoprecipitated (PDGFβ-R-antibody) versuscoimmunoprecipitated (Shc-antibody), and cell fractionation studies that suggested that the PDGFβ-R phosphorylated by AngII and PDGF-BB is located in separate subcellular compartments (Fig. 8). These studies are the first to suggest that transactivation of tyrosine kinase receptors by GPCRs involves a unique pathway that regulates a population of tyrosine kinase receptors different from the endogenous tyrosine kinase ligand (Fig. 9). In the discussion below, the different mechanisms for AngII- and PDGF-mediated PDGFβ-R tyrosine phosphorylation are examined based on the model shown in Fig. 9. It has become clear that ROS mediate many of the rapid responses of VSMC to growth-promoting agents (19.Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 562-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28.Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 29.Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ.

ROS are essential for both PDGF-mediated stimulation of VSMC DNA synthesis (20.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar) and for AngII-mediated increases in VSMC hypertrophy (32.Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In addition, ROS are necessary for increases in signal events related to cell survival and protein synthesis such as activation of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway (33.Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W.

Finally, inhibiting ROS-dependent signal transduction events by overexpression of catalase (34.Brown M.R. Miller Jr., F.J. Li W.G. Ellingson A.N. Mozena J.D. Chatterjee P. Engelhardt J.F. Zwacka R.M. Oberley L.W. Fang X. Spector A.A. Weintraub N.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or by treatment with antioxidants such asN-acetylcysteine (35.Tsai J.C. Jain M. Hsieh C.M. Lee W.S. Yoshizumi M. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Cooke C. Wang H. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3667-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) inhibits VSMC DNA synthesis and cell survival. In the present study we observed that AngII-dependent phosphorylation of both the PDGFβ-R and Shc required ROS generation (Fig. 4). Similar results have been shown by others for PDGF and its receptor (20.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). What is the nature of the ROS-stimulated tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the PDGFβ-R and Shc in response to AngII? In the present study we show that the kinase is not PYK2 (no calcium requirement, Fig. 3), not Src (no effect of the Src kinase inhibitor PP1, Fig. 6), and not JAK2 (no effect of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490, Fig.7). The PDGFβ-R tyrosine kinase plays a role in AngII-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R but not of Shc (Fig. 5). Specifically, we found that the population of PDGFβ-R which is not bound to Shc is completely dependent on the endogenous PDGFβ-R tyrosine kinase as shown by inhibition with AG1296 (Fig.5 B). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R that is complexed to Shc was not altered by AG1296 (Fig.5 B). As expected, PDGF-BB-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both populations of the PDGFβ-R was inhibited by AG1296 (Fig. 5). A candidate tyrosine kinase that could transactivate the PDGFβ-R is Syk. Syk is a nonreceptor 72-kDa tyrosine kinase, first isolated from porcine spleen and capable of phosphorylating Shc (36.Qin S. Inazu T. Yamamura H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There are reports showing that Syk is involved in ERK1/2 activation following activation of GPCRs (37.Wan Y. Bence K. Hata A. Kurosaki T. Veillette A. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Syk is expressed mainly in cells of the lymphoid system, although high level expression has been observed in mouse heart (38.Fluck M. Zurcher G. Andres A.C. Ziemiecki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to determine whether Syk is expressed in VSMC and is activated by AngII. The adaptor protein Shc appears to be central to the differences in AngII- and PDGF-mediated phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R. Shc proteins are adaptors, involved in the signaling events of GPCRs, as well as receptor tyrosine kinases (39.Sudgen P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 40.van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that association of Shc with the PDGFβ-R in VSMC determines the nature of PDGFβ-R phosphorylation and subcellular location. Stimulation of PDGFβ-R that is not complexed to Shc by either AngII or PDGF-BB causes tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ-R, and the receptor remains in a low molecular weight complex. We characterize this population of PDGFβ-R as residing in compartment I, possibly cytosol (Fig. 9). PDGF-BB binding to the PDGFβ-R causes Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, and the Shc-phosphorylated PDGFβ-R complex (when stimulated by PDGF-BB) also resides in compartment I as shown by our inability to sediment the Shc·PDGFβ-R complex (Fig. 8, Aand B). In contrast, AngII has a very different effect as shown by the finding that high speed centrifugation after AngII stimulation sedimented the Shc-phosphorylated PDGFβ-R complex (Fig.8 B, compartment II). After solubilizing the pellet resulting from the high speed centrifugation at 22,500 × g we could recover all of the Shc-phosphorylated PDGFβ-R in that pellet, which leads to two possible conclusions. One is that the yet unidentified “Shc-kinase” phosphorylates the PDGFβ-R bound to Shc on different tyrosine residues than the intrinsic PDGFβ-R kinase, and this results in the translocation to a different compartment. A second explanation is that the Shc-kinase itself forms a multiprotein complex with the Shc-phosphorylated PDGFβ-R complex, which then leads to translocation to a different compartment. Further studies in our laboratory will be done to address these possibilities. Candidate locations for compartments I and II are the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, respectively, based on work of Lottiet al. (27.Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These investigators showed that in quiescent NIH/3T3 cells, Shc is localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (27.Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Upon receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation, Shc redistributed toward the cell periphery (plasma membrane and endocytic structures) (27.Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Shc redistribution was lost in cells transfected with a phosphorylation-defective mutant of the EGF-R, suggesting that the interaction of Shc with specific phosphotyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the activated receptor is required to redistribute Shc to the cell periphery. The mechanism for Shc redistribution by GPCRs, however, remains to be elucidated. There is evidence that the different Shc proteins (66-, 52-, and 46-kDa isoforms) are localized in different compartments of the cell (41.Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M.V. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Clark et al. (42.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Biol. Cell. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) showed that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the 66-kDa isoform was localized mainly to the endoplasmic reticulum, the 46-kDa isoform to the plasma membrane, and the 52-kDa isoform was distributed evenly throughout the cytosol (42.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Biol. Cell. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is possible that GPCRs and tyrosine kinase receptors couple preferentially to a specific Shc isoform. However, in the present study, both AngII and PDGF-BB stimulated phosphorylation predominantly of 66-kDa Shc with minimal phosphorylation of the 52- and 46-kDa isoforms. In addition, the different nature of receptor phosphorylation by either a cytosolic tyrosine kinase (in the case of AngII) or an intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase (PDGF-BB) may influence the subcellular location of Shc. Transactivation of the EGF-R by AngII in cardiac fibroblasts has been shown to be important in the regulation of fibronectin and transforming growth factor-β synthesis (13.Moriguchi Y. Matsubara H. Mori Y. Murasawa S. Masaki H. Maruyama K. Tsutsumi Y. Shibasaki Y. Tanaka Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The importance of PDGFβ-R phosphorylation by AngII remains unclear, but the mechanism differs clearly from EGF-R phosphorylation. One model for EGF-R-mediated transactivation by AngII involves an increase in intracellular calcium that stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase PYK2. PYK2 then forms a complex with c-Src, and phosphorylation of EGF-R occurs via interactions with c-Src and/or PYK2 (12.Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Masaki H. Maruyama K. Tsutsumi Y. Moriguchi Y. Shibazaki Y. Tanaka Y. Iwasaka T. Inada M. Matsubara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 43.Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Inagami T. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Owada K.M. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 201-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGF-R transactivation by AngII as reported by Eguchi et al. (31.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) involves an increase in intracellular calcium and leads to the EGFR-dependent Ras activation and subsequent p70s6K kinase activation via two parallel pathways. However, the activation of p70s6K kinase via these two pathways was similar whether AngII or EGF was the agonist. In contrast, in the present study, we show that PDGFβ-R phosphorylation by AngII did not require calcium or c-Src. Furthermore, we show that PDGFβ-R phosphorylation by AngII involves a mechanism distinct from that activated by PDGF-BB. The phosphorylation, localization, and binding of Shc to the PDGFβ-R seem to be important for the signal transduction pathway identified here. Thus, Shc appears to be an important mediator to study the functional significance of receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation by AngII."

Stow J.L. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 245-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A relatively recent development in understanding how some of these proteins are concentrated into functionally differentiated regions of the plasma membrane has been the discovery of the so-called PDZ domain family of proteins and associated PDZ-binding proteins. Named after the initial three members of the family (PSD-95,Drosophila discs large protein, and ZO-1), PDZ proteins contain 80–100-amino acid stretches that allow them to interact with other proteins that have a four amino acid PDZ-binding cassette, usually at the extreme C terminus of the cytoplasmic domain (2.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 209-233PubMed Google Scholar). One such PDZ-binding cassette is the amino acid sequence D(S/T)XL. Thus, putative PDZ-binding proteins can be identified by screening their amino acid sequence for these concensus cassettes. Among the many proteins identified so far are the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (3.Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc.

Furthermore, NHE-RF has been reported to interact with the Na+/HCO3−co-transporter, a basolateral protein in proximal tubules (15.Bernardo A.A. Kear F.T. Santos A.V. Ma J. Steplock D. Robey R.B.

The B1 (56-kDa) subunit of the vacuolar proton-pumping ATPase (H+ATPase) has a C-terminal DTAL motif, which suggests that it is a candidate PDZ-binding protein. This subunit of the H+ATPase is expressed in several tissues, but it is strongly amplified in specialized proton-translocating intercalated cells in the kidney (16.Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), as well as similar cells in the epididymis (17.Breton S. Smith P.J. Lui B. Brown D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In contrast, a highly homologous 56-kDa isoform, the B2 isoform, is expressed in the kidney proximal tubule, but it has a C-terminal truncation and lacks the terminal PDZ-binding cassette (16.Nelson R.D.

Most if not all of the PDZ-binding proteins so-far reported are transmembrane proteins, but the B1 H+ATPase subunit is part of the V1 portion of the holo-enzyme and has no membrane spanning domain. It is tethered to the membrane by interaction with other subunits of the enzyme, some of which span the lipid bilayer (18.Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multi-subunit complexes consisting of the cytoplasmic portion of the H+ATPase can exist as free, cytosolic entities (18.Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In kidney cortex, intercalated cells show a complex regulation of H+ATPase expression at the cell surface (19.Al-Awqati Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1571-C1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and subpopulations of these cells with apical, basolateral, diffuse, or even bipolar H+ATPase localization can be detected by immunocytochemistry (20.Brown D. Hirsch S. Gluck S. Nature. 1988; 331: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A-cells always have H+ATPase at their apical pole and the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger AE1 at their basolateral pole (21.Alper S.L. Natale J. Gluck S. Lodish H.F. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These cells secrete protons into the tubule lumen. B-cells have no detectable AE1 in either plasma membrane domain, but the H+ATPase can be apical, basolateral, or bipolar in these AE1-negative cells. Cells with basolateral H+ATPase are bicarbonate-secreting cells. Although systemic acidosis results in more intercalated cells having apical H+ATPase, and alkalosis shifts more cells to a basolateral pattern of localization (22.Sabolic I. Brown D. Gluck S.L. Alper S.L. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 125-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23.Purcell H. Bastani B. Harris K.P. Hemken P. Klahr S. Gluck S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F365-F376PubMed Google Scholar), the cell biological mechanisms underlying these dramatic shifts in the polarized expression of a membrane protein remain unknown in situ. In this report, we show that the 56-kDa B1 subunit of the proton pump is a PDZ-binding protein that can associate with NHE-RF and that NHE-RF colocalizes with the H+ATPase in all B-intercalated cells, wherever the pump is located within any individual cell. We propose that the interaction of this subunit of the proton pump with NHE-RF could be responsible for the anchoring and/or targeting of membrane-associated H+ATPase molecules in this cell type. NHE-RF was barely detectable in A-type intercalated cells. In contrast, NHE-RF was abundant in the proximal tubule brush border, but its intracellular location was clearly distinct from that of the H+ATPase in these cells. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal, 0.1 ml of a 50 mg/ml solution/100 g of body weight), and kidneys were fixed by perfusion through the abdominal aorta with a fixative containing 4%paraformaldehyde, 10 mm sodiumperiodate, 70 mmlysine (PLP), and 5% sucrose as described previously (24.McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar, 25.Breton S. Alper S.L. Gluck S.L. Sly W.S. Barker J.E. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F761-F774PubMed Google Scholar). After 5 min of perfusion, kidneys were removed, sliced, and fixed by immersion for a further 6 h before rinsing and storage in PBS1 (10 mmsodium phosphate buffer containing 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). For preparation of 4-μm sections, tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose before sectioning with a Reichert Frigocut microtome using disposable knives. Tissue sections picked up on Fisher Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific) were rinsed for 10 min in PBS and then treated with 1% SDS for 5 min. This step augments antigenicity of many proteins in frozen sections of PLP-fixed tissues, as described previously (26.Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). After three more rinses (5 min each) in PBS to remove the SDS, sections were incubated for 20 min in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific background staining. Primary anti-NHE-RF antibody (affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody IC270 raised against GST-NHE-RF fusion protein amino acids 270–358) was applied for 2 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:4. This antibody has been characterized previously (27.Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After washing twice for 5 min in high salt PBS (PBS containing 2.7% NaCl) to reduce nonspecific staining and one further washing for 5 min in normal PBS, secondary anti-rabbit antibodies (diluted 1:800) coupled to CY3 (Jackson Immunologicals) were applied for 60 min. After further washing as above, sections were mounted in Vectashield anti-fading solution (Vector Labs., Burlinghame, CA), diluted 1:1 in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. Some sections were double-stained with anti-H+ATPase antibodies to identify the cells that were positive for NHE-RF in the collecting duct. After application of the anti-NHE-RF antibody followed by secondary antibody coupled to CY3, an affinity purified chicken polyclonal antibody against the 31-kDa E subunit of the H+ATPase (a marker of A- and B-intercalated cells, diluted 1:40) was applied for 2 h, followed by a donkey anti-chicken IgG coupled to FITC, diluted 1:200 (Jackson Immunologicals). Sections were mounted in Vectashield diluted 1:1 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Some sections were double stained using a rabbit anti-AE1 Cl−/HCO3− exchanger antibody that has been previously characterized (28.Alper S.L. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Biemesderfer D. Shmukler B.E. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F601-F614PubMed Google Scholar). Because this antibody is also raised in rabbit, an amplification procedure was used to allow staining of sections with two primary antibodies raised in the same species. Briefly, the first primary, anti-AE1, was applied at a dilution of 1:32,000, a concentration that is too low to be detected by conventional application of a fluorescent secondary antibody, as determined in preliminary experiments. The dilute AE1 antibody was detected using a tyramide amplification kit (NEN Life Science Products) with tyramide-CY3 as a fluorescent reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were then incubated conventionally with anti-NHE-RF and secondary goat anti-rabbit FITC as described above. No cross-reactivity between the two sets of reagents was detectable under these conditions. Sections were photographed in color on Kodak Ektachrome 400 Elite film exposed at 2500 ASA using a Nikon Eclipse 800 epifluorescence microscope equipped with specific CY3 and FITC filter combinations. Using the specific CY3 filter combination and analog photography, CY3 emission appears yellow (see Fig. 1,A and C). Some micrographs were prepared from digital images captured from the Nikon Eclipse 800 using a Hamamatsu Orca digital camera. Pseudocolored images were merged using IP Lab Spectrum software (Scanalytics Inc, Vianna). In these images, CY3 fluorescence appears red, and FITC is green (see Fig. 2). Control incubations were performed in which the primary NHE-RF antibody was incubated with the GST-NHE-RF fusion protein (at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature prior to applying the antibody to the sections.Figure 2Double staining of rat kidney cortex collecting ducts with antibodies against NHE-RF (green) and AE1 (red). Thered AE1 staining is basolateral in all A-intercalated cells. These cells do not stain for NHE-RF. In A, two cells with apical NHE-RF staining are found alongside an A-intercalated cell with basolateral AE1 staining. In B, two cells with basolateral NHE-RF staining are found in the same tubule as A-intercalated cells with basolateral AE1. Other cells are negative for both antigens.C shows a collecting duct with a mixture of AE1 positive/NHE-RF negative A-intercalated cells and NHE-RF-positive/AE1-negative B-intercalated cells. A small amount of punctate NHE-RF staining is seen in cells that are probably principal cells. In these merged digital images, CY3 staining is pseudocoloredred to allow it to be more readily distinguished from the adjacent green FITC staining. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kidneys of anesthetized rats were perfused with cold PBS for 1–2 min to remove blood, and the inner stripe was separated under a dissecting microscope. Pieces of inner stripe (0.4 g) were homogenized in 2 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, mixture of protease inhibitors) using a Wheaton glass potter fitted with a Teflon pestle (20 complete strokes). Rat kidney inner stripe cytosol was prepared by centrifugation of the homogenate for 1 h at 100,000 × g (41,000 rpm) using a Beckman, TL-100 Ultracentrifuge equipped with a TLA 55 rotor. Protein concentration of cytosol was measured with the Pierce BCA protein assay reagent using albumin as a standard. Pull-down experiments were performed essentially as described previously (27.Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, rat kidney inner stripe cytosol (0.4 mg of total protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 600 pmol of GST-NHERF or GST alone as a control immobilized on GSH-Sepharose 4B beads. For the peptide competition assay, peptides B1 (PQDTEADTAL) and B2 (EFYPRDSAKH) were dissolved in distilled water, and 300 μg of peptide were preincubated with the GST-NHE-RF beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Cytosol containing 300 μg of peptide was then added to the beads, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing Pefabloc and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Rat kidney cytosol was prepared as for the pull-down assay, except that cytosol from the entire cortex and outer medulla was used to ensure that adequate amounts of NHE-RF were present in the preparation. NHE-RF was immunoprecipitated from 500 μl (2.8 mg of total protein) of precleared (by preincubation with protein A-agarose beads alone) cytosol using 10 μl of anti-NHE-RF antiserum (IC270 serum or IC270 preimmune serum) and 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with PBS and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer (as for the pull-down assay). The immunoprecipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted using a monoclonal anti-E subunit antibody (E11) as described below. Electrophoresis was performed using 12% SDS-Tris-glycine-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed by Western blotting. The following antibodies were used as detailed in the figure legends: affinity-purified chicken polyclonal anti-E H+ATPase subunit (1:1,000) and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-B1 H+ATPase subunit (1:1,000), raised against the bovine subunits, and a monoclonal anti-E subunit antibody (E11) kindly provided by Dr. Steven Gluck (University of Florida, Gainesville). Images were scanned and analyzed with NIH Image (version 1.62) software. NHE-RF was localized in the kidney on PLP-fixed cryostat sections that had been treated with SDS. As expected from the reported distribution of NHE-3 (29.Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by far the greatest amount of NHE-RF was found in proximal tubules. The entire brush border was strongly stained in all proximal tubule segments (Fig.1, A and C). In addition, however, staining was seen in some cells of the cortical collecting ducts and connecting segments (Fig. 1, A andC). The extent and intracellular location of this staining was variable, with some cells showing distinct basolateral staining (Fig. 1 A), others showing a more diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1 C), and yet others showing apical staining (Fig. 1 C). These cells were identified as intercalated cells by double incubations using a chicken polyclonal antibody against the 31-kDa (E) subunit of the H+ATPase (Fig. 1, Band D). We have previously shown that the three major subunits of the cytoplasmic domain of this enzyme colocalize in intercalated cells (30.Brown D. Hirsch S. Gluck S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus, the E subunit is a reliable marker for the entire cytoplasmic domain of the H+ATPase, which also contains the 56 B kDa subunit. In these double-stained sections, the NHE-RF staining colocalized with the H+ATPase staining in intercalated cells, whereas connecting tubule cells that also contain the H+ATPase do not express detectable levels of NHE-RF (Fig. 1, C and D). However, in some intercalated cells, apical H+ATPase staining was seen with no detectable NHE-RF staining (Fig. 1 A). Principal cells in some tubule segments showed a faint, finely granular staining in the cytoplasm that was much less intense than in the adjacent intercalated cells. To distinguish between A- and B-intercalated cells, anti-AE1 antibodies, which label only A-cells (21.Alper S.L. Natale J. Gluck S. Lodish H.F. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), were used in conjunction with anti-NHE-RF antibodies. All cells with distinct apical, diffuse, or basolateral NHE-RF staining were negative for AE1 (Fig.2). Furthermore, only A-intercalated cells are found in the inner stripe of the outer medulla, and these cells showed no detectable staining with the NHE-RF antibody (not shown). Thus, NHE-RF is most highly expressed in B-intercalated cells, and its variable intracellular localization pattern overlaps with that of the H+ATPase in each individual B-cell in the cortical collecting duct and connecting segment. In proximal tubules, NHE-RF was present in the brush border (Fig.3), as predicted from previous studies that showed abundant NHE-3 in this location (11.Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 29.Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the H+ATPase staining was, as we have previously described (30.Brown D. Hirsch S. Gluck S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), the most concentrated in a tight subapical band at the base of the brush border. This subapical domain, showing intense H+ATPase staining in the S3 segment, did not contain detectable levels of NHE-RF (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the known expression of the C-terminally truncated B2 isoform of the 56-kDa subunit in these cells, which lacks the DTAL PDZ-binding motif (16.Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). NHE-RF was not detected in the basolateral domain of proximal tubules. To determine the specificity of labeling with anti-NHE-RF antibodies in kidney cortex, parallel incubations were performed with normal anti-NHE-RF antibody and with antibody that had been preincubated with 0.2 mg/ml of the GST-NHE-RF fusion protein that was used as an immunogen. The results show that the proximal tubule staining, as well as the apical, basolateral, and bipolar intercalated cell staining were completely abolished by preincubation with the immunizing fusion protein (Fig. 4). Sepharose beads to which a GST-NHE-RF fusion protein was bound were used as an affinity matrix to extract potential binding proteins from renal medullary cytosol. A cytosolic preparation from the inner medulla was used for these experiments because (a) kidney cytosol contains large amounts of free cytosolic H+ATPase subunits (Fig.5 A, Cytosol), (b) this kidney region contains high levels of the B1-H+ATPase isoform, located in A-type intercalated cells, and (c) this region contains no proximal tubules, which express abundant endogenous NHE-RF that could potentially compete with protein binding to the affinity matrix. Under these conditions, Western blots of the affinity-purified material bound to the beads showed that both the B1 and the E subunits of the H+ATPase were present (Fig. 5 A). Control experiments using the matrix with GST alone showed little or no H+ATPase subunit antigenicity associated with the beads in the absence of NHE-RF, indicating the specificity of the association. The binding of H+ATPase to the NHE-RF-GST affinity matrix was completely inhibited by incubation of the beads with an 11-amino acid C-terminal peptide derived from the B1 H+ATPase subunit, which contains the C-terminal motif DTAL (PQDTEADTAL). However, binding was not inhibited by preincubation with a peptide containing the 11 C-terminal amino acids of the B2 56-kDa subunit isoform (EFYPRDSAKH), which does not contain the PDZ-binding motif (Fig. 5 B). to strengthen the evidence for an in vivo interaction between NHE-RF and the H+ATPase, evidence for co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins from rat kidney cytosol was sought. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the E subunit of the H+ATPase was co-immunoprecipitated from kidney cytosol by the anti-NHE-RF antibody but not by preimmune serum. The present data show that the 56-kDa B1 subunit isoform of the H+ATPase is a PDZ-binding protein that allows association of the cytosolic (V1) portion of the H+ATPase with NHE-RF, a PDZ protein that is expressed in the kidney. Immunolocalization indicates that in the collecting duct and connecting segment, this association occurs in a specialized subtype of intercalated cell, the B-cell, which has a highly variable pattern of intracellular localization of the H+ATPase (19.Al-Awqati Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1571-C1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Brown D. Hirsch S. Gluck S. Nature. 1988; 331: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21.Alper S.L. Natale J. Gluck S. Lodish H.F. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 23.Purcell H. Bastani B. Harris K.P. Hemken P. Klahr S. Gluck S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F365-F376PubMed Google Scholar). Other collecting duct cell types, including principal cells and A-intercalated cells, showed a very low level of staining. The greatest amount of NHE-RF staining was observed, as expected in proximal tubules, but some thin limbs of Henle in the medulla were also strongly stained (not shown). Especially intriguing is the failure to detect NHE-RF in A-type intercalated cells, which also contain high levels of the B1-H+ATPase subunit but which always have an apical staining for this protein, either on the plasma membrane or on numerous subapical vesicles. Thus, NHE-RF expression is amplified in the AE1-negative B-cell population, in which the pattern of H+ATPase localization is widely variable. This result suggests that the B-cell represents a distinct cell type with respect to NHE-RF expression and that NHE-RF could be involved in generating and/or maintaining apical and basolateral H+ATPase polarity in B-cells. Because A-cells, which insert H+ATPase uniquely into the apical domain, contain little or no detectable NHE-RF, we conclude that NHE-RF is in some way involved in the ability of B-cells to display plasticity of membrane H+ATPase insertion. This could occur via the association of NHE-RF with merlin and/or ezrin, members of the ERM (ezrin, radixin,moesin) family of actin binding proteins, which bind to the C-terminal of NHE-RF (27.Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31.Yun C.-H.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Other factors, including an extracellular matrix protein named hensin, have also been implicated in generating the plasticity of the intercalated cell phenotype at leastin vitro (19.Al-Awqati Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1571-C1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Al-Awqati Q. Vijayakumar S. Hikita C. Chen J. Takito J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F183-F190PubMed Google Scholar). An additional interesting finding is that both the B1 and B2 subunits of the H+ATPase are capable of binding actin directly via their N-terminal domains (33.Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the H+ATPase interacts with the actin cytoskeleton both directly and indirectly (via NHE-RF). The respective roles and the regulation of these two mechanisms of interaction now need to be evaluated in different cell types. Indeed, phosphorylation of NHE-RF has been shown to disrupt the indirect interaction of the β2-adrenegric receptor with the actin cytoskeleton and to affect the endocytic sorting of this receptor (34.Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Although antibodies against all of the H+ATPase subunits were not utilized in this study, at least two major cytosolic subunits associated with the NHE-RF-GST beads in an affinity binding assay, and the E (31 kDa) subunit of the H+ATPase was co-immunoprecipitated from rat kidney cytosol by anti-NHE-RF antibodies. Because of interference from the rabbit-derived polyclonal NHE-RF IgG used for immunoprecipitation, we were unable to determine whether the 56-kDa H+ATPase subunit was also co-immunoprecipitated from these samples. In addition, our data show that a peptide derived from the C terminus of the B1 56-kDa subunit isoform, but not from the B2 isoform, inhibits interaction of the H+ATPase with NHE-RF. Coupled with previous data showing that preassembled H+ATPase cytoplasmic domains exist in the cytosol (18.Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the cytosolic portion of the H+ATPase can bind NHE-RF via a specific interaction with the C-terminal DTAL motif that is unique to the B1 subunit. Furthermore, our data provide some evidence that the interaction occurs via the C-terminal domain of the 56-kDa subunit, because the rest of the protein sequence of these two isoforms is similar except for a short N-terminal sequence difference (16.Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 35.Puopolo K. Kumamoto C. Adachi I. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3696-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that when this 56-kDa subunit is assembled in a membrane together with the transmembrane portion of the H+ATPase (the Vo sector), the entire H+ATPase assembly could thereby be coupled to NHE-RF and thus be anchored into a selected membrane domain. However, it is interesting that this domain can be either the apical or the basolateral domain in the B-intercalated cell. It has been stated recently that NHE-RF expression is restricted to the apical domain of epithelial cells (36.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but this is clearly not the case in B-intercalated cells. Thus, NHE-RF may not determine the polarity of H+ATPase expression per se, but NHE-RF might stabilize the complex once it has reached its target membrane. In other cell types, NHE-RF appears to stabilize the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the apical plasma membrane (3.Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), whereas in Caenorhabditis elegans, PDZ proteins have been proposed to be involved in basolateral anchoring and/or targeting of a TGF-β homolog (37.Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, a Drosophila PDZ protein, discs lost, was also reported to have a dual role in maintaining apical and basolateral epithelial cell polarity (38.Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S. Lu Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the diffuse, intracellular pattern of NHE-RF and H+ATPase localization seen in some B-intercalated cells raises the possibility that NHE-RF might participate in the trafficking or targeting of the H+ATPase. Whether PDZ proteins are involved in anchoring, targeting, or both processes remains to be determined, but our results clearly indicate that this process is not unidirectional (i.e. exclusively apical) in every cell type. In the proximal tubule, NHE-RF is abundant and is colocalized with NHE-3 in the apical brush border (data not shown). This scaffolding interaction is probably responsible for maintaining NHE-3 at a high concentration in the apical membrane (29.Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B subunit of the H+ATPase that is expressed in this tubule segment lacks the C-terminal DTAL and should be incapable of interacting with PDZ domain proteins (16.Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence shows that the H+ATPase is not colocalized with NHE-RF at the apical pole of proximal tubules. Because H+ATPase is involved in the extensive apical membrane endocytosis and recycling that occurs in proximal tubules (1.Brown D. Stow J.L. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 245-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), it may be advantageous for this cell type to express an isoform of the H+ATPase B subunit that cannot interact with NHE-RF at the apical membrane. Such an interaction would anchor the H+ATPase in the plasma membrane by cross-linking to the NHE-3/NHE-RF complex and might hinder the endocytotic recycling of this protein, leading to failure of the endosomal acidification process and defective recycling of apical membrane proteins. We have previously reported that the 56-kDa B1 subunit of the H+ATPase is present on endosomes in the other collecting duct cell type, the principal cell (39.Sabolic I. Wuarin F. Shi L.B. Verkman A.S. Ausiello D.A. Gluck S. Brown D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These endosomes are involved in recycling the water channel AQP2, they do not acidify their lumen, and they lack other subunits of the H+ATPase (39.Sabolic I. Wuarin F. Shi L.B. Verkman A.S. Ausiello D.A. Gluck S. Brown D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We postulated that the 56-kDa subunit might be a promiscuous subunit that could associate with the membranes of these endosomes via another, as yet unidentified mechanism. This mechanism can now be envisaged to occur via the PDZ-binding domain, although principal cells were only weakly stained with the anti-NHE-RF antibody. Thus, it is possible that in principal cells, a different PDZ protein such as the NHE-RF related NHE-RF2 (3.Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) might be associated with the 56-kDa H+ATPase B1 subunit. In summary, we have shown that the B1 subunit isoform of the H+ATPase is a PDZ-binding protein that associates with NHE-RF and may therefore be responsible for linking the H+ATPase to the cytoskeleton in these cells. The two proteins are colocalized in B-intercalated cells but not in A-cells, suggesting a role in generating, maintaining, or modulating the B-cell phenotype. NHE-RF and H+ATPase are not colocalized in proximal tubules, which express a truncated B2 subunit isoform of the H+ATPase that lacks the PDZ-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2025314268,"Unlike other tumor necrosis factor family members, the cytotoxic ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)/Apo-2L contains an unpaired cysteine residue (Cys230) in its receptor-binding domain. Here we show that the biological activity of both soluble recombinant TRAIL and cell-associated, full-length TRAIL is critically dependent on the presence of Cys230. Mutation of Cys230 to alanine or serine strongly affected its ability to kill target cells. Binding to its receptors was decreased by at least 200-fold, and the stability of its trimeric structure was reduced. In recombinant TRAIL, Cys230 was found engaged either in interchain disulfide bridge formation, resulting in poorly active TRAIL, or in the chelation of one zinc atom per TRAIL trimer in the active, pro-apoptotic form of TRAIL.

Mutation of Cys230 to alanine or serine strongly affected its ability to kill target cells. Binding to its receptors was decreased by at least 200-fold, and the stability of its trimeric structure was reduced. In recombinant TRAIL, Cys230 was found engaged either in interchain disulfide bridge formation, resulting in poorly active TRAIL, or in the chelation of one zinc atom per TRAIL trimer in the active, pro-apoptotic form of TRAIL. tumor necrosis factor TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand B cell activation factor of the TNF family amino acid hemagglutinin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wild type Ligands and receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 family function to trigger cell growth, differentiation, activation, and apoptosis and are mainly implicated in the maintenance and function of the immune system (1.Smith C.A.

The TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo-2L) displays cytotoxic activity toward a number of transformed cell lines but not against most primary cells, suggesting that it may be a useful anti-tumor agent (2.Pitti R.M.

Recent reports demonstrating that TRAIL is able to counteract progression of human tumor xenografts in a murine model support this hypothesis (4.Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A.

There are several receptors for TRAIL that all belong to the TNF receptor family. These include TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5, TRAIL-R3/DcR1, and TRAIL-R4/DcR2, which display high sequence homology in their extracellular domains and have TRAIL as their only known ligand. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), however, belongs to a distinct subfamily and binds to both TRANCE/RANKL/OPGL and TRAIL. The widely expressed TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 contain an intracellular death domain and can signal apoptosis; the remaining receptors are believed to function as decoys and either do not contain a functional death domain (TRAIL-R4), have a glycolipid anchor (TRAIL-R3), or exist in a soluble form (osteoprotegerin) (for a review on TRAIL-Rs, see Ref. 6.Degli-Esposti M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of TNF receptor family members have an elongated shape stabilized by multiple disulfide bridges, which is reflected at the level of the primary structure by a characteristic pattern of Cys residues (7.Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In contrast, ligands are formed of anti-parallel β-sheets folding into the so-called “jellyroll” structure, which in some cases is stabilized by a single disulfide bridge (8.Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D.

TRAIL is remarkable in that it contains an unpaired Cys residue (Cys230) at the corresponding position where some other ligands have a disulfide bridge. TRAIL, alone or in complex with TRAIL-R2, has been crystallized recently by three different groups (10.Cha S.S. Kim M.S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.J. Shin N.K. Shin H.C. Sung Y.C. Oh B.H.

Although Cys230 appears to be important in the organization of the different structures, it has been found either (a) as a free Cys residue, (b) involved in disulfide bridge formation with Cys230 of another monomer (and as a free Cys in the remaining monomer), or (c) as a zinc chelator, together with the Cys residues of the remaining two monomers. In this study, we show that Cys230 is required for optimal TRAIL activity and for stabilization of the TRAIL trimeric structure. We confirm the presence of one zinc atom per trimer of TRAIL, and we find that the presence of the interchain disulfide bridge decreases its specific activity, suggesting that Cys230 in the active TRAIL coordinates a zinc atom, rather than forming a disulfide bridge. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody and M2-agarose were purchased from Sigma. Anti-HA mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody 16B12 was from Babco (Richmond, CA). Anti-mouse IgG1 γ1 chain antibodies coupled to peroxidase were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL).

These or related vectors have been described previously (14.Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Mattmann C. Scuderi P. Terskikh A. Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys230 to Ala or Ser was performed by a polymerase chain reaction-based method and was confirmed by sequencing. Expression of FLAG-TRAIL and FLAG-BAFF was achieved by induction in M15 pRep4 bacteria (Qiagen) for 16 h at 18 °C. Bacteria were resuspended in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl) and lysed in a French press. FLAG-TRAIL and FLAG-BAFF recovered in the soluble fraction were affinity purified on M2-agarose, eluted with 50 mm citrate-NaOH pH 2.7, immediately neutralized with Tris-HCl, pH 9, and the buffer was exchanged for either TBS, PBS, or 140 mm Suprapure NaCl by repeated centrifugation in protein concentrators (Centrikon-10 or -30, Amicon, Easton, TX). To study the pH sensitivity of TRAIL, bacterial pellets corresponding to 20 ml of culture were lysed in 1 ml of a universal pH buffer containing 30 mm each sodium citrate, sodium borate, sodium phosphate, and sodium barbital at pH 5–9. Bacterial lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and supernatants, containing TRAIL at about 100 μg/ml, were collected. For FLAG-TRAIL produced by transient transfection of 293T cells in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (14.Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Mattmann C. Scuderi P. Terskikh A. Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18827-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), cell supernatants were concentrated 20 times in Centrikon-10. Cytotoxic assays for soluble FLAG-TRAIL were performed in the presence of 2 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 as described previously (15.Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). For chromium release assays using transfected 293T cells, 2 × 106 BJAB cells were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μCi of Na2[51Cr]O4. 104 labeled BJAB cells were co-cultured with the indicated ratio of transfected 293T cells, in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml TRAIL-R2:Fc or Fas:Fc. Maximum release was obtained by lysing cells in 700 mm HCl. Released [51Cr] was monitored after 15 h, and the percentage of specific chromium release was calculated as follows: (measured release− spontaneous release)/(maximum release − spontaneous release). The binding of FLAG-TRAIL (purified or in crude bacterial extracts) to plate-bound TNF-R1:Fc and TRAIL-R1(R2)(R3)(R4):Fc was detected with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and secondary reagents as described previously (14.Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Mattmann C. Scuderi P. Terskikh A. Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18827-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Purified wt and mutant TRAILs expressed in Escherichia coli were loaded onto a Superdex-200 HR10/30 column and eluted in PBS at 0.5 ml/min with on-line monitoring at 280 nm. The identity of the eluted peaks was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2. The column was calibrated with a set of standard proteins for gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Soluble wt or mutated TRAIL carrying FLAG or HA tags were co-transfected in 293T cells. After 3 days, cell supernatants were pre-cleared with Sepharose 6B and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose. Beads were washed 4 times with PBS and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies followed by peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG γ1 chain. For the precipitation of TRAIL with TRAIL-R2:Fc, 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was mixed with 20 μg ofE. coli-produced TRAIL and 10 μg of TRAIL-R2:Fc (or CD40:Fc in the control) in a final volume of 70 μl, for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was poured into an empty mini-column, washed 3 times with 200 μl of PBS, and eluted with 20 μl of 0.1m citrate/NaOH, pH 2.7. The unbound fractions, final washes, and neutralized eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and Coomassie Blue staining. TRAIL in a matrix of sinapinic acid (Aldrich) was analyzed in a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE, Perspective Biosystem, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (λ = 317 nm) to desorb and ionize the sample. Ion masses were assigned based on an external mass calibration using peptides of known molecular mass. Relative intensities in the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization spectra are not proportional to relative abundance of the species, due to intrinsic variability in the desorption process. Proteins in 140 mm Suprapure NaCl were loaded on a 5-ml HiTrap desalt column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted at 0.5 ml/min in 140 mmSuprapure NaCl. Fractions (500 μl) were analyzed for protein content by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and for zinc content by electrothermal atomization atomic absorption using a Perkin-Elmer Analyst 800 spectrometer equipped with a graphite furnace, using the external standard method and Zeemann background correction. The light source was an Intensitron hollow cathode lamp operated at 15 mA, using the 213.9 nm emission line for zinc. The furnace temperature program was as follows: 30 s at 110 °C, 110–130 °C over 15 s, 30 s at 130 °C, 130–300 °C over 15 s, 30 s at 300 °C, 5 s at 1800 °C (measure), and 3 s at 2450 °C (regeneration). The molar ratio of zinc has been calculated using the following molecular masses: 23.8 (TRAIL), 24.2 (BAFF), and 37.5 kDa (thermolysin). Purified wt TRAIL expressed in E. coli (100 μg per condition) was dialyzed for 7 days at 4 °C against 1000 volumes of TBS, pH 7.5, supplemented or not with 1 mm EGTA, EDTA or ortho-phenanthroline. Buffers were replaced after 24 h. Dialyzed TRAILs were assayed for TRAIL-R2 binding and for zinc content as described above. Thermolysin was dialyzed for 24 h under otherwise identical conditions. Its proteolytic activity was measured as follows: thermolysin (3 μg/ml) was incubated for 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min at 37 °C in TBS containing 4 mg/ml azocasein (Sigma). Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid at 5%. After centrifugation, absorbance of supernatants containing soluble azocasein peptides was measured at 366 nm. Members of the TNF family can be classified into three main classes on the basis of the disulfide bridge pattern in their extracellular TNF homology domains. LTα, LTβ, 4–1BBL, and TRANCE have no disulfide bridges. The crystal structures of TNFα and CD40L reveal the presence of a disulfide bridge between the CD and EF loops (8.Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and FasL, LIGHT, VEGI, CD30L, and CD27L have a predicted disulfide bridge at corresponding positions. Finally, TWEAK, EDA, APRIL, and BAFF have a predicted disulfide bridge between β-strands E and F (Fig.1). In addition, several ligands display unpaired Cys residues that are mainly located in the middle of β-strands C (mLTα, LTβ, TWEAK, TRANCE, and CD30L), D (CD40L), or F (EDA). TRAIL is unique in that both the human and murine sequences contain a single Cys residue in the TNF homology domain that is located in the EF loop at the exact same position as one of the Cys of the disulfide bridge of TNFα, FasL, and LIGHT. However, the corresponding position in the CD loop of TRAIL is a Glu residue instead of the expected Cys residue. As the role of this unpaired Cys residue of TRAIL was unclear, we decided to study its function in more detail. Soluble forms of wild type (wt) and mutated (C230A and C230S) FLAG-tagged recombinant soluble TRAILs were produced in E. coli (Fig. 2 A), and their activities were assayed on the TRAIL-sensitive Jurkat cell line. TRAIL wt was cytotoxic when cross-linked with anti-FLAG antibodies, as described previously (Fig. 2 B) (15.Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In contrast, TRAILs C230A and C230S were totally inactive under the same conditions (Fig.2 B). The interaction between wt TRAIL and TRAIL-R1, -R2, -R3, and -R4 was readily demonstrated in an ELISA, whereas TRAILs C230A and C230S showed very little specific binding and only at high concentrations (data not shown). The integrity of the quaternary trimeric structure of TRAIL was determined by gel permeation chromatography. We found that wt TRAIL eluted from the column with an apparent mass of about 80 kDa, which is compatible with a trimeric structure. In contrast, TRAIL C230S and C230A were markedly smaller and eluted with an apparent mass of about 28 kDa corresponding to a monomer (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). As the affinity purification procedure included an acid elution step, we assessed acid lability of TRAIL. Bacteria expressing comparable levels of wt or mutated TRAIL were lysed at different pH values (Fig. 2 D), and TRAIL-R2 binding activity of these extracts was subsequently measured in PBS (Fig. 2 E). In bacterial lysates prepared at pH 8 or pH 7, wt TRAIL bound TRAIL-R2 200–1000-fold better than mutated TRAIL. In addition, a clear pH sensitivity effect was observed for mutant, but not for wt TRAIL, in lysates prepared at higher or lower pH values (Fig. 2 E). Mutation of Cys230 therefore affects both the activity and stability of TRAIL. We confirmed the effect of Cys230 mutation on TRAIL activity in a distinct experimental setup, using N-terminally FLAG-tagged, full-length TRAIL expressed in mammalian cells. Whenever TRAIL was expressed in mammalian cells, we only used the C230A mutation because the C230S mutation generated a predictedN-glycosylation site in the sequence of TRAIL, which was indeed utilized during biosynthesis. Both wt and C230A TRAILs were expressed at comparable levels (Fig.3 A), but only cells transfected with wt TRAIL displayed significant cytotoxic activity on the target BJAB cells (Fig. 3 B). The observed cytotoxic activity was completely abrogated by soluble TRAIL-R2, but not by the soluble Fas control, confirming that the observed cytotoxicity was a direct effect of TRAIL expression. Thus, Cys230 is essential for TRAIL cytotoxicity, regardless of the construct and expression system used. A defect in the quaternary structure of TRAIL C230A was observed in the mammalian expression system by co-immunoprecipitation of secreted soluble TRAILs. Wild type TRAILs expressed with two different tags co-precipitated, showing their oligomerization capacity. In contrast, TRAIL C230A failed to interact either with itself or with wt TRAIL (Fig. 3 C). We conclude that Cys230 plays an essential role in the assembly and/or maintenance of the quaternary structure of TRAIL. In proteins, cysteine residues can be involved in posttranslational events such as internal thioester and disulfide bridge formation, isoprenylation, fatty acid acylation, and metal coordination, or they can remain as a free SH group displaying a structural or catalytic role. The measured molecular mass of TRAIL (23,832 ± 10 Da, predicted 23,839.8 Da) and its soluble behavior during Triton X-114 phase separation excluded that Cys230would carry large or hydrophobic substituents (Fig.4 A and data not shown). However, a minor proportion of the recombinant TRAIL produced inE. coli migrated as a dimer by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, indicating the presence of an interchain disulfide bridge. A minor species of 47,699 ± 20 Da, corresponding to a TRAIL dimer, was also detected by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4, A andB). When TRAIL was expressed in mammalian cells, disulfide-linked TRAIL was by far the major product (Fig.4 C), but dimers were never detected in Cys230mutants, indicating that Cys230 is directly implicated in disulfide bridge formation. In our hands, soluble TRAILs expressed in mammalian cells (with high disulfide bridge content) have been consistently less cytotoxic than those produced in E. coli(with low disulfide bridge content), and we have measured a 20–30-fold lower specific activity for their binding to TRAIL-R2. This may indicate that disulfide-linked Cys230 is not favorable for TRAIL activity. Indeed, we found that non-disulfide-linked TRAIL bound recombinant receptor better than disulfide-linked TRAIL (Fig. 4 D). Interestingly, both wt and C230A full-length TRAIL expressed in mammalian cells formed dithiothreitol-sensitive dimers, which migrated with slightly different mobilities, raising the possibility that additional interchain disulfide bridges may occur in the membrane proximal portion of the extracellular domain of TRAIL, where 2 additional Cys residues are located (data not shown). Whether this results in the cross-linking of membrane-bound TRAIL trimers remains to be determined. Cysteine residues are known to coordinate zinc atoms to proteins, and as the Cys residues of TRAIL are suitably positioned to coordinate a metal ion (10.Cha S.S. Kim M.S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.J.

Jones E.Y. Screaton G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we measured the zinc content in recombinant TRAIL by atomic absorption. Proteins were prepared in a low zinc solution and size-fractionated just prior to analysis to remove the ubiquitous unbound zinc ions. We measured 1.08 mol of zinc per mol of positive control (the zinc-metalloprotease thermolysin), 0.027 mol of zinc per mol of negative control (BAFF, another TNF family member (13.Schneider P. MacKay F. Steiner V. Hofmann K. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Ambrose C. Lawton P. Bixler S. Acha-Orbea H. Valmori D. Romero P. Werner-Favre C. Zubler R.H. Browning J.L. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar)), and 0.326 mol of zinc per mol of TRAIL, i.e. 0.98 mol of zinc per TRAIL trimer, whereas TRAIL C230S only contained background levels of zinc (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the Cys230 residues coordinate one zinc atom per trimeric TRAIL, therefore stabilizing TRAIL in the correct conformation for receptor binding and activity. Surprisingly, dialysis of TRAIL for as long as a week against any of the chelating agents EGTA, EDTA, orortho-phenanthroline did not significantly alter its binding to TRAIL-R2, whereas the proteolytic activity of the positive control thermolysin was completely abolished after only 1 day of these treatments. Atomic absorption analysis indicated that zinc was still present in dialyzed TRAIL, suggesting that zinc is tightly associated with TRAIL and/or not accessible within the structure (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude that different experimental conditions may achieve zinc removal from TRAIL, as published recently (16.Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A. Totpal K. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our results are strongly supported by the crystallographic study of Hymowitz et al. (11.Hymowitz S.G. Christinger H.W. Fuh G. Ultsch M. O'Connell M. Kelley R.F. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Mol.

No zinc atoms were reported in the other two available structures (10.Cha S.S. Kim M.S. Choi Y.H. Sung B.J. Shin N.K. Shin H.C. Sung Y.C. Oh B.H.

Biol. 1999; 6: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), but it is noteworthy that in both cases TRAIL was obtained by refolding from inclusion bodies, which may preclude uptake of a zinc atom. In one case, an S–S bridge occurred between two Cys230 of TRAIL co-crystallized with TRAIL-R2 (12.Mongkolsapaya J. Grimes J.M. Chen N. Xu X.N. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Screaton G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although disulfide-linked TRAIL binds to its receptor less efficiently than zinc-containing TRAIL (Fig. 4 D), it is conceivable that it may play a physiological role under certain conditions. TRAIL with a C230S mutation has been described as being indistinguishable from wt TRAIL in its ability to immunoprecipitate TRAIL-R2 (12.Mongkolsapaya J. Grimes J.M. Chen N. Xu X.N. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Screaton G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which is in discrepancy with our results. However, immunoprecipitation may not reveal a change in affinity, especially if one of the components is present in large excess. It is also possible that refolded wt TRAIL lacking the zinc atom may display the same decreased activity as the Cys230 mutant. In addition to TRAIL, several TNF family members display unpaired Cys residues in their receptor-binding domain. The Cys residue present in the β-sheet C of TWEAK, LTβ, and CD30L corresponds to and probably fulfills the same structural role as Ser186 of TRAIL, which faces to the interior of the monomer and is engaged in a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of Phe274 in β-sheet H. Cys194 of CD40L in β-sheet D is located on the outer surface of the trimer (9.Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and is not conserved in murine CD40L. Finally, the unpaired Cys residues of EDA and TRANCE are predicted to be distant in the trimeric structure based on sequence alignment with TNF family members of known structures (Fig. 1 A). The metalloprotein TRAIL thus remains unique within the TNF family. Comparison of the primary and three-dimensional structure of TNFα (8.Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol.

In TNFα, loops CD and EF are linked by a disulfide bridge (see Fig. 1 B), whereas loop EF of TRAIL is arranged differently to allow correct positioning of the unpaired Cys residue to chelate a zinc atom.

The substantial majority (99.3%) of the oligomers from the susceptible strain D344S contained the usual d-alanyl --> d-asparaginyl (or d-aspartyl)-l-lysyl cross-link (d-Ala --> d-Asx-l-Lys) generated by beta-lactam-sensitive DD-transpeptidation. The remaining oligomers (0.7%) were produced by beta-lactam-insensitive LD-transpeptidation, because they contained l-Lys --> d-Asx-l-Lys cross-links. The muropeptide oligomers of the ampicillin-resistant mutant D344M512 contained only these l-Lys --> d-Asx-l-Lys cross-links indicating that resistance was due to the bypass of the beta-lactam-sensitive DD-transpeptidation reaction. The discovery of this novel resistance mechanism indicates that DD-transpeptidases cannot be considered anymore as the sole essential transpeptidase enzymes."

Ganglioside nomenclature is based on that of Svennerholm (39.Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar) Glycosphingolipids are amphipathic molecules (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) that are synthesized by sequential actions of glycosyltransferases (2.Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of one of three different sugars onto lactosylceramide (LacCer)1 results in the synthesis of one of three major glycolipid series, i.e.ganglioside series (α2,3-sialic acid), lacto/neolacto series (β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine), and globo series (α1,4-galactose). Although a number of genes coding for enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the carbohydrate moiety of glycosphingolipids have been recently isolated (3.Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), no glycosyltransferase genes specific for the synthesis of globo series glycolipids have been isolated to date. Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) is synthesized by α1,4-galactosyltransferase (α1,4Gal-T) from LacCer (4.Taga S. Mangeney M. Tursz T. Wiels J. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This glycolipid has been characterized on red blood cells as the Pk antigen of the P blood group system (5.Marcus D.M. Kundu S.K. Suzuki A. Semin. Haematol. 1981; 18: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). Since a monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactive with Burkitt's lymphoma-associated antigen was reported by Wiels et al. (6.Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6485-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the recognized antigen was elucidated to be Gb3 (7.Nudelman E. Kannagi R. Hakomori S. Parsons M. Lipinski M. Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Science. 1983; 220: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the expression and biological significance of Gb3 have been vigorously studied (8.Klein G. Manneborg-Sandlund A.

Since Gb3 was clustered as CD77 (11.Knapp W. Gilks W.R. Dorken B. Rieb P. Schmidt R. Leukocyte Typing IV. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 118Google Scholar), we refer to this antigen as Gb3/CD77. Gb3/CD77 was reported to be expressed in high amounts on Burkitt's lymphoma cells. However, it is now considered to be a differentiation antigen expressed on B cells and can also be found in some malignant tumors of B cell lineage (8.Klein G. Manneborg-Sandlund A. Ehlin-Henriksson B. Godal T. Wiels J. Tursz T. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 31: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Among normal leukocytes, it is only expressed on a subset of tonsillar B cells in the germinal centers (10.Murray L.J. Habeshaw J.A. Wiels J. Greaves M.F Int. J. Cancer. 1985; 36: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, germinal center B lymphocytes expressing Gb3/CD77 undergo rapid and spontaneous apoptosis when isolated and culturedin vitro (12.Mangeney M. Richard Y. Coulaud D. Tursz T. Wiels J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Burkitt's lymphoma cells with Gb3/CD77 antigen were also easily induced to enter apoptosis upon culture at low serum concentration or cross-linking by anti-immunoglobulin M antibodies (13.Gregory C.D. Dive C. Henderson S. Smith C.A. Williams G.T. Gordon J. Rickinson A.B. Nature. 1991; 349: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Gb3/CD77 has been recognized as a receptor for verotoxins (VTs) (14.Jacewicz M. Clausen H. Nudelman E. Donohue-Rolfe A. Keusch G.T. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar,15.Lingwood C.A. Law H. Richardson S. Petric M. Brunton J.L. De Grandis S. Karmali M. J Biol.

Lively T.A. Chen M.E. Rothman S.W. Formal S.B. Lancet. 1983; 1: 702Abstract PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). VT B subunit specifically binds to Gb3/CD77, and then the A subunit is incorporated into cells, resulting in the degradation of 28 S ribosomal RNA and cell death (17.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Yutsudo T. Takeda Y. Ogasawara T. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). However, only the B subunit is also able to induce apoptosis when cross-linked (18.Mangeney M. Lingwood C.A. Taga S. Caillou B. Tursz T. Wiels J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5314-5319PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that Gb3/CD77 is a critical molecule in mediating apoptosis signals, although the precise mechanisms remain to be investigated. In this study, we have cloned the cDNA of the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene by a eukaryotic cell expression cloning. The isolated cDNA revealed that Gb3/CD77 synthase is a type II membrane protein with no significant homology with any other galactosyltransferase genes cloned so far. Transfection of the cloned cDNA into L cells could constitute a functional receptor for VTs. A cDNA library was prepared from poly(A+) RNA of a human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-37 as described (19.Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The library contained 5 × 106independent colonies. The strain of bacteria was MC1061/P3 (20.Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mouse fibroblast L cell was kindly provided by Dr. A. P. Albino (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum. Stable transfectants of L cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum and G418 (300 μg/ml). Plasmids of the cDNA library were transfected into L cells together with pdl3027 (polyoma T gene, provided by Dr. C. Basilico (New York University, New York)) using DEAE-dextran as described (20.Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h, the transfected cells were detached and incubated with a rat mAb 38.13 (6.Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6485-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) on ice for 45 min. After washing, cells were plated on dishes coated with rabbit anti-rat IgM (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as described (19.Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was rescued from the panned cells by preparing Hirt extracts and transformed into MC1061/P3. The same procedure was repeated five times. Using microscale transfection and immunofluorescence assay, cDNA clones that determined the CD77 expression were isolated. The DNA sequence was determined by dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing using the PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and a model 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The enzyme activity of α1,4Gal-T was measured as described previously (21.Taniguchi N. Yanagisawa K. Makita A. Naiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4908-4913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane fractions were prepared as described (22.Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6149-6155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for the assay contained the following in a volume of 50 μl: 50 mmsodium cacodylate-HCl (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm galactonolactone (Sigma), 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 0.4 mm LacCer, 2.9 mm phosphatidylglycerol (Sigma), 0.2 mm UDP-Gal (Sigma), UDP-[14C]Gal (2.5 × 105 dpm) (NEN Life Science Products), and membrane fraction containing 50 μg of protein. The protein concentration was determined by the methods of Lowry et al.(23.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products was isolated by a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed by TLC and autoradiograph using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Multiple Choice Northern blot membranes (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) were used. They were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe of pVTR1 or control β-actin as described (20.Nagata Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycolipids were extracted as described (24.Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, glycolipids were extracted from about 400 μl of packed cells using chloroform/methanol (2:1, 1:1, 1:2) sequentially. TLC was performed on a high performance TLC plates (MERCK, Darmstadt) using the solvent system chloroform, methanol, 0.22% CaCl2 (60:35:8) and sprayed by orcinol. For standards, bovine brain ganglioside mixture (Wako, Tokyo), neutral glycolipids from human erythrocytes, and Gb3 (Sigma) were used. The identity of Gb3/CD77 was confirmed by TLC-immunostaining using an aluminum-backed silica plate (Merck) as described (24.Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After TLC, the plate was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described (25.Taki T. Handa S. Ishikawa D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After blocking, the plate was incubated with mAb, and then antibody binding was detected with the ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and Konica Immunostaining HRP-1000 (Konica, Tokyo). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology search was carried out using the Internet program BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Amino acid sequence and hydropathy analyses were performed with GENETYX-MAC software, version 8.0 (Software Development, Tokyo). Cell Surface expression of CD77 was analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) as described (22.Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6149-6155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). mAb 38.13 or TU-1 (26.Miyamoto D. Ueno T. Takashima S. Ohta K. Miyawaki T. Suzuki T. Suzuki Y. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was used with Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG or anti-mouse IgM (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), respectively. To prepare stable transfectants, pVTR1 and pSV2neo were co-transfected into L cells using Lipofection kit (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan). To select transfectants, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing fetal bovine serum (7.5%) and G418 (300 μg/ml). G418-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Clones transfected with pSV2neo alone were prepared for control. To compare the reactions of L-VTR1 and L-neo to VTs, MTT assay was performed using cells prepared in 48-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well) and cultured in the presence of VT1 or VT2. The assay was performed by triplicate samples. To quantify the cell proliferation, 50 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline was added to each well. After incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, the supernatants were aspirated, and 100 μl ofn-propyl alcohol containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 4 mm HCl was added. The color reaction was quantitated using automatic plate reader IMMUNO-MINI NJ-2300 (Nihon InterMed, Tokyo, Japan) at 590 nm with a reference filter of 620 nm. Cells were cultured in the presence of VT2 (200 ng/ml). After 24 h, cells were collected and the pellets were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and 2 μl of RNase (10 mg/ml) and 2 μl of Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) were added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the fragmented DNA was 2-propanol-precipitated. Electrophoresis was conducted using DNA derived from 1.5 × 106 cells in a 2% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide in TEA buffer. L cells do not contain α1,4Gal-T activity and not express CD77, while they expressed abundant LacCer as described (22.Yamashiro S. Haraguchi M. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Nagata Y. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6149-6155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These properties of L cells made them excellent host recipient cells for cDNA cloning of α1,4Gal-T. A cDNA library in pCDM8 constructed from mRNA of SK-MEL-37 was used for transfection, since SK-MEL-37 expressed a fairly high level of α1,4Gal-T, although it lacked surface expression of CD77. Finally, two clones were isolated that showed positive reactions in microscale immunofluorescence assays. Since the two clones were essentially same, one of them was selected for further analysis and named pVTR1. As shown in Fig.1 C, L cells transfected with pVTR1 expressed a definite amount of CD77, whereas those transfected with the vector alone did not. Glycosphingolipids extracted from the transfectant cells showed definite Gb3 bands in TLC, although the transfectant cells with pCDM8 alone showed no Gb3 band (Fig.2 A), suggesting that the cloned pVTR1 was derived from the α1,4Gal-T gene. TLC-immunostaining revealed strong bands of Gb3 only in the extracts from the cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2TLC of glycolipids extracted from transiently- transfected cells. A, glycolipids were extracted from L cells transfected with pCDM8 alone (VC) or pVTR1/CDM8 (TF) and then separated in TLC. RBC, neutral glycolipids extracted from human B red blood cells.

TLC was prepared as in A and then blotted and stained by mAb 38.13 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig.3 shows the entire sequence of the insert of pVTR1. The initiation codon is embedded within a sequence similar to the Kozak consensus initiation sequence (27.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar, 28.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). This open reading frame predicts a 353-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 40,498 daltons. No cDNAs or proteins in the data base showed significant homology to the product of VTR1. A single hydrophobic segment with 26 amino acids was present near the amino terminus (Fig. 3 A). This putative signal anchor sequence would place 19 residues within the cytoplasm and 308 amino acids within the Golgi lumen. The presence of two potential N-glycosylation sites is indicated. A relatively high frequency of proline (10/31) was detected at the C′-side of the transmembrane domain. L cells transfected with pVTR1/CDM8 showed high Gb3 synthase activity (7,012 units (pmol/h/mg of protein)) when LacCer was used as an acceptor. On the other hand, L cells transfected with pCDM8 alone were completely negative. Thus, this cDNA determined α1,4Gal-T activity and the surface expression of CD77, indicating that this cDNA encodes the Gb3/CD77 synthase. Enzyme activity toward other potential acceptors was also examined. None of the acceptors examined except LacCer and galactosylceramide showed significant levels of [14C]galactose incorporation (Fig. 4 B).K m values for these two substrates were 54.5 μm (LacCer) and 132 μm(galactosylceramide). The P1 antigen in the P blood group system is also formed by α1,4-galactose transfer (acting on paragloboside), but it was confirmed that this enzyme is not responsible for the synthesis of P1 antigen (Fig. 4 B). Expression levels of the α1,4Gal-T gene in various human tissues were examined by Northern blotting. Among tissues examined, heart, kidney, spleen, liver, testis, and placenta strongly expressed the gene (Fig. 5). A stable transfectant of pVTR1 (L-VTR1) clearly demonstrated strong expression of Gb3/CD77, while L-neo expressed did not (Fig.6 A). The sensitivity of these two cell lines to VTs were compared using the MTT assay. L-VTR1 in VT (+) medium showed marked growth suppression compared with that cultured in the absence of VT, while L-neo showed no effects of VT (Fig.6 B). MTT Assay of L-VTR1 and L-neo after the exposure to various concentrations of VTs revealed marked growth suppression of L-VTR1 even at 0.01 ng/ml but not of L-neo (Fig. 6 C). To confirm the mechanisms for the death of VT-treated L-VTR1, DNA fragmentation was examined. Agarose gel electrophoresis of cytoplasmic DNA extracted from L-VTR1 revealed a clear pattern of DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 6 D). In contrast, the L-neo sample did not show any ladder formation. Thus, it was confirmed that Gb3/CD77 generated by the cDNA serves as a functional receptor for VTs. Expression of Gb3/CD77 antigen is sometimes cryptic, depending on co-expressed sialosyl components on the cell surface (29.Wiels J. Holmes E.H. Cochran N. Tursz T. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14783-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SK-MEL-37 melanoma line, which was the source of the cDNA library used, was also negative for CD77 expression despite showing a definite α1,4Gal-T activity. Nevertheless, we could isolate cDNA clones of the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene from the cDNA library. The cDNA clones obtained here are very valuable, because this enzyme initiates the synthesis of globo series glycolipids. Results of a homology search indicated that no significantly homologous cDNA has been reported to date. Although a number of members of β1,3-galactosyltransferases or β1,4Gal-Ts have been identified (30.Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M. Hollingsworth M.A. Hassan H.

Pevsner J. Shaper N.L Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), this gene is the first and only α1,4Gal-T gene isolated so far. Moreover, no homologous genes to this gene were detected in the data base of Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster genes, although many β1,4Gal-T- and β1,3-galactosyltransferase-related genes have been identified. These facts may indicate that the α1,4Gal-T gene evolved relatively later than other galactosyltransferase genes, and globo series glycolipids synthesized through Gb3 are playing more precise roles compared with glycolipids of the other series. Gb3/CD77 seems to be unusual because it can mediate various apoptotic signals in both normal cells and malignant tumor cells, although it does not contain the cytoplasmic domain (18.Mangeney M. Lingwood C.A. Taga S. Caillou B. Tursz T. Wiels J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5314-5319PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Taga S. Carlier K. Mishal Z. Capoulade C. Mangeney M. Lecluse Y. Coulaud D. Tetaud C. Pritchard L.L. Tursz T. Wiels J. Blood. 1997; 90: 2757-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed rapid death of CD77+ germinal center B cells in vitrosuggests that endogenous ligand molecules interact with Gb3/CD77 to bring about the physiologic selection of immature B cells (12.Mangeney M. Richard Y. Coulaud D. Tursz T. Wiels J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 35.Mangeney M. Rousselet G. Taga S. Tursz T. Wiels J. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the capability of the B subunit of VT to induce apoptosis of Gb3/CD77+ cells (18.Mangeney M. Lingwood C.A. Taga S. Caillou B. Tursz T. Wiels J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5314-5319PubMed Google Scholar) strongly encourages the investigation of Gb3/CD77-associating cytoplasmic molecules (34.Taga S. Carlier K. Mishal Z.

Investigations of these ligands and signal transducers relevant to Gb3/CD77 might contribute in further understanding of the B cell selection and of the pathogenesis of hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E. coli O157 infection. In particular, the tissue specificity of the syndrome, such as renal failure, hemolysis, and neurological disorders, might be clarified by gene manipulation of the cloned Gb3/CD77 synthase. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that Gb3/CD77 and ganglioside GM3 may function as alternative cofactors for the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in CD4-induced interactions between gp120 and glycosphingolipid microdomains (36.Puri A.

https://openalex.org/W1985111316,"The Nicotiana plumbaginifolia plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform PMA2, equipped with a His6 tag, was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified. Unexpectedly, a fraction of the purified tagged PMA2 associated with the two yeast 14-3-3 regulatory proteins, BMH1 and BMH2. This complex was formed in vivo without treatment with fusicoccin, a fungal toxin known to stabilize the equivalent complex in plants. When gel filtration chromatography was used to separate the free ATPase from the 14-3-3·H+-ATPase complex, the complexed ATPase was twice as active as the free form. Trypsin treatment of the complex released a smaller complex, composed of a 14-3-3 dimer and a fragment from the PMA2 C-terminal region. The latter was identified by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry as the PMA2 C-terminal 57 residues, whose penultimate residue (Thr-955) was phosphorylated. In vitrodephosphorylation of this C-terminal fragment prevented binding of 14-3-3 proteins, even in the presence of fusicoccin. Mutation of Thr-955 to alanine, aspartate, or a stop codon prevented PMA2 from complementing the yeast H+-ATPase. These mutations were also introduced in an activated PMA2 mutant (Gln-14 → Asp) characterized by a higher H+ pumping activity. Each mutation directly modifying Thr-955 prevented 14-3-3 binding, decreased ATPase specific activity, and reduced yeast growth. We conclude that the phosphorylation of Thr-955 is required for 14-3-3 binding and that formation of the complex activates the enzyme.

The H+-ATPase belongs to the P-type ATPase family characterized by a catalytic phosphorylated intermediate (for reviews, see Refs.1.Michelet B. Boutry M. Plant Physiol.

The existence of several H+-ATPase genes suggests the gene products exhibit diverse catalytic or regulatory properties. Heterologous expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has notably allowed this premise to be addressed but also demonstrated that differentArabidopsis thaliana or Nicotiana plumbaginifoliaH+-ATPase isoforms have distinct kinetics (9.Palmgren M.G.

In vivo functional differences have also been found for two N. plumbaginifolia H+-ATPase isoforms that confer distinct growth properties on yeast, depending on the external pH (11.Luo H. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 119: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The plant H+-ATPase contains an auto-inhibitory domain located in the C-terminal region downstream of the last transmembrane span (12.Palmgren M.G. Sommarin M. Serrano R. Larsson C. J. Biol.

The H+-ATPase·14-3-3 complex formed in plants is labile and can only be studied in the presence of fusicoccin. This fungal toxin binds to, and stabilizes, a complex of H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins (15.Jahn T. Fuglsang A.T. Olsson A. Bruntrup I.M. Collinge D.B. Volkmann D. Sommarin M. Palmgren M.G. Larsson C.

Another mode of plant H+-ATPase regulation is kinase-mediated phosphorylation, which has been shown by both in vitro (20.Schaller G.E. Sussman M.R.

However, the effect of H+-ATPase phosphorylation on the enzyme is much debated, with separate reports associating increased H+-ATPase activity with either dephosphorylation (22.Vera-Estrella R. Barkla B.J. Higgins V.J. Blumwald E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 104: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23.Desbrosses G. Stelling J. Renaudin J.P. Eur. J.

(Bethesda). 1996; 111: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This controversy could reflect different phosphorylation sites within H+-ATPase, including one involving 14-3-3 binding. The 14-3-3 proteins mediate signal transduction by binding to consensus motifs containing a phosphoserine residue (29.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 30.Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Putative phosphorylation motifs are present in the H+-ATPase C-terminal region, but none is a known 14-3-3 binding motif (31.De Boer B. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 60-66Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The penultimate residue (Thr) of a spinach H+-ATPase engaged in a complex with 14-3-3s upon fusicoccin treatment is phosphorylated and protected from turnover (26.Olsson A. Svennelid F. Ek B. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1998; 118: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if phosphorylation is a prerequisite for 14-3-3 protein binding and whether phosphorylation would have occurred in the absence of fusicoccin. The PMA21 (plasma membrane H+-ATPase) H+-ATPase from N. plumbaginifolia has several characteristics that make it a good model for regulatory studies in yeast. It can functionally replace theS. cerevisiae plasma membrane H+-ATPase, allowing plasma membranes containing only this isoform to be obtained (10.de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although functional replacement of yeast H+-ATPase by wild-type PMA2 requires an external pH higher than 5.0, several activated pma2 mutants that confer grow at pH 4 or even pH 3 have been selected. These mutations, found in various regions of the enzyme, all give structural modifications that cause displacement of the regulatory C-terminal region and enhanced proton pumping activity (13.Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32.Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Finally, the expression of PMA2 in yeast gives strong fusicoccin binding activity that involves a complex with yeast 14-3-3 regulatory proteins (33.Piotrowski M. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Oecking C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30018-30023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By equipping both wild-type PMA2 and an activated PMA2 mutant with an N-terminal His tag to facilitate their purification, we report the surprising result that PMA2 phosphorylated at its penultimate residue forms a stable complex with 14-3-3s in the absence of fusicoccin. This binding gives both increased H+-ATPase activity and more effective complementation of yeast growth. The plasmid 2μp(PMA1)pma2, containing either the wild-type N. plumbaginifolia pma2 cDNA or the mutant E14D (32.Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), was modified by PCR to introduce a sequence coding for 6 histidine residues at either the C terminus (before the stop codon) or the N terminus (between codons 3 and 4). For C-terminal tagging, the primers Pth1 (5′-GTCACAAGATCTCGAAGT-3′) and Pth2 (5′-TGGGTCTCCATGGTTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGAACAGTGTATGATTGCTG-3′) were used to generate a first PCR product containing a unique NcoI restriction site downstream of the stop codon. The primers Pth3 (5′-CATTGAACCATGGAGACCCAAGTCAGAGTGTGTTCGGCCA-3′) and Pth4 (5′-GCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGA-3′) were used to amplify the 3′-untranslated region, giving a second PCR product. The two partly overlapping PCR products were combined and amplified as a single fragment, using primers Pth1 and Pth4. The new fragment was digested with BglII/XbaI and used to replace the corresponding fragment in plasmid 2μp(PMA1)pma2. For N-terminal tagging, an identical strategy was used, except that the primers were Pth5 (5′-GAATTCGAGCTCGGTACC-3′), Pth6 (5′- GTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTCCCCCATACTTGCTTCAATTTCCTC- 3′), Pth7 (5′-ATGGGGGAGCATCACCATCACCATCACAAACCTGAGGTGTTAGATGC-3′), and Pth8 (5′-GCTTTA GGAGCTAGCCGAGC-3′). The full-length PCR product, digested by SacI/NheI, was used to replace the corresponding fragment in plasmid 2μp(PMA1)pma2. Plasmids with N-tagged wild-type or E14D PMA2 were modified by PCR to exchange the penultimate residue, Thr-955, for Ala (T955A), Asp (T955D), or a stop codon (T955STOP). Plasma membranes were prepared according to Morsomme et al. (13.Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, pepstatin, and chymostatin (protease inhibitor mixture), and all manipulations were at 4 °C. The plasma membranes were resuspended (5 mg/ml) in 20 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol. A 10% (w/v) solution of polyoxyethylene 8 lauryl ether (C12E8) in the same buffer was added to give a final detergent:protein ratio of 1:2 (w/w); the sample was thoroughly mixed for 10 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended (5 mg/ml) in buffer TK20 (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol). A 10% (w/v) solution of dodecyl maltoside (DDM) in buffer TK20 was added to give a detergent:protein ratio of 1:1 (w/w), and the sample was thoroughly mixed and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was added to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose matrix (Qiagen) (0.5 ml of matrix, 2.5 mg of proteins); the mixture incubated for 1 h on a rotary wheel at 4 °C, loaded into a column, and then washed 4 times with 500 μl of buffer TK20 containing 0.05% (w/v) DDM. Bound proteins were eluted with 250 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM. Separation of the free H+-ATPase and the H+-ATPase·14-3-3 complex was achieved using a Bio-Prep SE 100/17 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 0.01% (w/v) DDM, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2. Coomassie Blue-stained proteins were quantified using ImageMaster1D software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), with phosphorylase b (97 kDa) as the standard. Western blot analysis was performed using specific antibodies directed against soluble regions of PMA2 (13.Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32.Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the enhanced biochemiluminescence method. For the analysis of 14-3-3 binding to PMA2, the tryptic digestion was performed at room temperature directly on nickel resin-bound purified H+-ATPase (solubilized from 10 mg of plasma membrane proteins) at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:166. The digestion was performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, in a final volume of 185 μl. After 1 h at 20 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The digestion medium and two 125-μl washes with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, were collected by centrifugation from a Micro Bio-Spin Chromatography Column (Bio-Rad) and pooled. The peptide mixture was fractionated using a BioLogic Duo-Flow System (Bio-Rad) equipped with a UNO anion-exchange column (UNO Q-1 column, Bio-Rad). Elution was performed with a linear gradient between buffer A (20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 1 mmMgSO4) and buffer B (20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 m NaCl). The standard ATPase assay was described previously (32.Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When solubilized ATPases were used, 0.1% (w/v) sonicated asolectin was added. Liposome preparation, reconstitution of membrane-bound enzyme, and the measurement of ATP-dependent proton pumping were performed as described previously (13.Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), except that reconstitution was performed by mixing 10 μg of the purified protein with 0.7 mg of asolectin in a total volume of 150 μl of 50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm Mes buffer, pH 7.0. The mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ATP-dependent proton pumping was measured after thawing the mixture on ice. The reaction was initiated with MgATP and stopped by addition of the ionophore, nigericin, or the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p- trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Fusicoccin binding activity was measured as described previously (33.Piotrowski M. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Oecking C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30018-30023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using 9′-nor-8′-hydroxy[3H]fusicoccin (1.06 Mbq nmol−1, 10 nm) as the radioligand. All tests were performed in duplicate. Blue native electrophoresis (34.Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) was performed with a polyacrylamide gradient gel (5–18%). The tryptic digests were prepared in 15% glycerol, 50 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and applied without Coomassie Blue. The dye which induced the protein charge shift was provided during electrophoresis by including 0.02% Coomassie blue (SERVA Bleu G) in cathode buffer. The second dimension (SDS-PAGE (35.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar)) was performed using a 16.5% T, 3% C gel overlaid with a 10% T, 3% T spacer gel and a 4% T, 3% C stacking gel. Western blot analysis was performed using specific antibodies directed against the C-terminal region of PMA2 (13.Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the enhanced biochemiluminescence method. Anion-exchange chromatography fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min on ice, the proteins were pelleted (20,000 × g for 30 min) and resuspended in 50 μl of 2% SDS (w/v) in water. The sample was diluted 20-fold and fractionated using a reverse-phase column (2.1 × 250 mm, Prosphere C18, Alltech) connected to an ABI 140B HPLC. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 85:15 acetonitrile:water (v/v). A linear gradient was developed over 100 min from 5% solvent B to 100% B. The peptide isolated by RP-HPLC (40 pmol or 0.265 μg) was dried under vacuum, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and dephosphorylated at 37 °C for 60 min using 1 unit of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For 14-3-3 binding experiments, the dephosphorylated peptide was resolved by SDS-PAGE (35.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was saturated for 30 min with 3% (w/v) milk powder, 0.5% Tween 80 in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl) and then washed three times for 10 min in 0.1% Tween 80 in TBS. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with purified 35S-labeled His-tagged 14-3-3 (20 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 5 mm MgSO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol). His-tagged 14-3-3 (Nicotiana tabacum, isoform T14-3c) expressed in Escherichia coli was labeled in a minimal medium supplemented with PRO-MIX (∼70%l-[35S]methionine and 30%l-[35S]cysteine)(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). After three washes for 5 min with 0.1% Tween in TBS, the membrane was dried and autoradiographed. Protein bands excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel or the RP-HPLC purified C-terminal peptide of PMA2 were digested overnight using 0.5 μg of trypsin in a total volume of 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, H218O (1:1). The peptides generated were partially mass-tagged at their C-terminal carboxyl moiety by incorporating 18O isotope (36.Gevaert K. Demol H. Verschelde J.-L. Van Damme J. De Boeck S. Vandekerckhove J. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Following digestion, a fraction of the peptide mixture (about 10% of the total) was concentrated on Poros R2 beads and analyzed by MALDI-MS peptide mass fingerprinting (37.Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J. Houthaeve T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The remaining peptide mixture was separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a 1-mm diameter C-18 column (1 × 50 mm, Vydac Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) (37.Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J. Houthaeve T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Eluting peptides were automatically collected in 50-μl aliquots, to which 5 μg of Poros R2 beads suspended in 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were added. Fractions were completely dried and the peptides desorbed from the beads using 0.7 μl of MALDI:matrix solution (a 5-fold dilution of 20 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 4 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water:acetonitrile (1:1)) (37.Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J. Houthaeve T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The matrix:peptide solution was then transferred onto the MALDI target, air-dried, and analyzed. All MALDI-mass spectra were obtained using a Bruker Reflex III Instrument (Bruker Instruments Inc., Bremen, Germany), with the delayed extraction option. RP-HPLC fractions from the purified C-terminal peptide of PMA2 were first analyzed in reflectron mode and then subjected to PSD analysis to be verified. For the identification of protein bands excised from the polyacrylamide gel, the Sequest program (38.Griffin P.R. MacCoss M.J. Eng J.K. Blevins R.A. Aaronson J.S. Yates III, J.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 1546-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) used PSD spectral data to search a 290,000-entry non-redundant protein data base for matches. In order to purify the N. plumbaginifolia PMA2 expressed in yeast, a His tag was added to either the C-terminal residue or to the N-terminal region (between residues 3 and 4) of the wild-type PMA2 and a mutated PMA2 (E14D). The mutant enzyme, which contains a glutamate to aspartate replacement at position 14, was more active and allowed yeast to grow at a lower pH (13.Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After transformation, the plasmid encoding the essential yeast H+-ATPase was eliminated by selection on a suicide substrate (10.de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The yeast strain expressing the N-tagged wild-type PMA2 grew at pH 6.0 but not at lower pH values, like the untagged wild-type PMA2 (Fig.1). However, the C-tagged wild-type PMA2 failed to replace the yeast H+-ATPase. In the case of the activated mutant (E14D), the N-tagged protein allowed growth down to pH 3.6, just like the untagged protein. However, C-tagging of the mutant reduced growth at both pH 6.0 and pH 4.0 and abolished growth at pH 3.6 (Fig. 1). These results indicate that C-terminal tagging of either the wild-type or mutant PMA2 interferes with enzyme function. Conversely, N-terminal tagging had no obvious deletions effects on enzyme function. Purified plasma membranes from yeast strains expressing the N-tagged wild-type or E14D PMA2 were stripped with C12E8, and the H+-ATPases were solubilized using DDM (39.Johansson F. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 92: 389-396Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and purified on a nickel column (Fig. 2). The Purified wild-type and mutated PMA2 were analyzed to determine whether the effects of the activating mutation were unaffected by purification. The N-tagged versions were chosen for analysis, since yeast growth was not affected by this modification. The E14D PMA2 had a lower K m and a higher V maxthan the wild-type PMA2 (Table I), and its pH optimum was shifted toward alkaline values (pH 7.0–7.2, compared with pH 6.4–6.8 for the wild type). Moreover, the ATPase activity of the E14D PMA2 was not stimulated by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), whereas that of the wild-type PMA2 was enhanced 3-fold (TableI). These data concur with the differences previously obtained with the membrane-bound non-tagged wild-type and mutant enzymes (13.Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A.

https://openalex.org/W2000342726,"Although the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene is activated by the intracellular Ca2+signals evoked via Ca2+ influx into neurons, little is known about how the activation of alternative BDNF gene promoters is controlled by the Ca2+ signals evoked viaN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDA-R) and L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCC). There is a critical range in the membrane depolarization caused by high K+ concentrations (25–50 mm KCl) for effective BDNF mRNA expression and transcriptional activation of BDNF gene promoters I and III (BDNF-PI and -PIII, respectively) in rat cortical culture. The increase in BDNF mRNA expression induced at high K+ was repressed not only by nicardipine, an antagonist for L-VDCC, but also by dl-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, an antagonist for NMDA-R, which was supported by the effects of antagonists on the Ca2+ influx. Although the promoter activations at 25 and 50 mm KCl were different, BDNF-PIII was activated by either the Ca2+ influx through NMDA-R or L-VDCC, whereas BDNF-PI was predominantly by the Ca2+influx through L-VDCC. Direct stimulation of NMDA-R supported the activation of BDNF-PIII but not that of BDNF-PI.

Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The main sites for extracellular Ca2+ influx leading to an activation of gene expression are theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDA-R),1 a subtype of ion channels of glutamate receptors, and L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCC) (2.Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ influx through both sites evokes intracellular Ca2+ signals through several signaling routes mainly involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (3.Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 4.Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E.

Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6189-6202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+signals are received by the Ca2+ signal-responsive DNA regulatory elements by a mediation of specific DNA-binding proteins, such as the cAMP/calcium response element and the serum response element, which are activated mainly by a specific binding of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and serum-responsive factor, respectively (6.Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6189-6202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Irrespective of the context of Ca2+signaling in neurons, however, the physiological role of the Ca2+ signalings evoked via NMDA-R versus L-VDCC in neurons, and the intracellular mechanisms for differentially conveying the Ca2+ signals for gene expression are still controversial.Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family and plays a key role in the survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity of neurons (8.Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). The rat BDNF gene consists of four short exons, exons I, II, III, and IV, and a 3′ exon, exon V, encoding the mature BDNF protein, giving rise to eight species of BDNF transcripts each of which contains exon I, II, III, or IV and a long or short exon V (9.Timmusk T. Palm K. Medis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Four promoters were mapped upstream of exons I, II, III, and IV, respectively, which are differentially activated by the kainic acid-induced seizure in distinct regions of the rat brain (9.Timmusk T. Palm K. Medis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). It is becoming evident that the alternative promoters are used as a versatile mechanism to create diversity and flexibility in the regulation of gene expression (10.Ayoubi T.A. Van de Ven W.J.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to know the transcriptional regulation of BDNF gene promoters I, II, III, and IV for a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms controlled by BDNF.Although the Ca2+ signal-mediated activation of the BDNF gene has well been established (2.Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 11.Zafra F. hengerer B. Leibrock J. Thoenen H. Lindholm D.

Commun. 1996; 229: 788-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it remains unclear how the alternative promoters of the BDNF gene are regulated by the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC and NMDA-R. Using DNA transfection in primary rat cortical neuronal cell culture, the DNA elements responsible for the Ca2+ signal-mediated activation of BDNF promoter III have been identified (4.Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 5.Shieh P.B. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and furthermore, we have characterized the BDNF promoter I as a Ca2+ signal-responsive promoter (13.Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14.Tabuchi A. Nakatani C. Nakaoka R. Naruse Y. Kojima T. Mori N. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study, therefore, we examined whether the BDNF gene promoters I and III responded differentially or similarly to the Ca2+ signals evoked via NMDA-R or L-VDCC. During this study, we also found that the mode of BDNF gene activation changed as the KCl concentration in the medium was raised and that this change was mediated by changes in modes of Ca2+ influx into neurons dependent upon the level of membrane depolarization.DISCUSSIONAmong the many possible roles of alternative promoters, such as varying the efficiency of transcription initiation, varying the turnover or translation efficiency of mRNA isoforms with different leader exons, changing the tissue specificity, reacting differentially to some extracellular signals, developmentally regulating gene expression, and generating protein isomers differing at the amino terminus, it has been suggested that the alternative promoters of the BDNF gene are involved in the control of tissue- and brain region-specific expression of the gene (9.Timmusk T. Palm K. Medis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the other usages of alternative BDNF gene promoters is important to reveal the mechanisms controlling the neuronal functions mediated by BDNF. Because it has well been established that the expression of the BDNF gene can be controlled by the intracellular Ca2+ signals (2.Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 11.Zafra F. hengerer B. Leibrock J. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 12.Sano K. Nanba H. Tabuchi A. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 788-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,18.Ichikawa D. Tabuchi A. Taoka A. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we focused on the effect of the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC and NMDA-R on the alternative BDNF gene promoters. Therefore, we measured the promoter activities of BDNF-PI and BDNF-PIII by transfecting the plasmid DNAs containing the BDNF gene promoter I or III and luciferase reporter gene to primary rat cortical neurons in culture and then stimulating the cells with high K+ (25 or 50 mm KCl) or NMDA (100 μm) in the presence of their respective antagonists, nicardipine and APV.In this study, we demonstrated that there were effective K+concentrations (25–50 mm KCl) for the activation of the BDNF gene (Fig. 1, A and B), although the extent of Ca2+ influx was still large above 75 mm KCl (Fig. 1 C), and that between 25 and 50 mm KCl, different modes of BDNF gene activation were evoked via the Ca2+ influx through L-VDCC and NMDA-R, which was demonstrated by the different sensitivities of BDNF gene activation to APV and nicardipine (Figs. 2 and 3). The increase in BDNF mRNA expression at 25 mm KCl was inhibited completely by APV but only partially by nicardipine, whereas that at 50 mm KCl was inhibited partially by both (Fig. 2 A). A difference in sensitivity to the antagonists between 25 and 50 mm KCl was also observed for the transcriptional activation of the BDNF gene promoters (Fig. 3). The BDNF-PI activation at 25 mm KCl was completely repressed not only by nicardipine but also by APV, whereas that at 50 mm KCl was repressed by nicardipine but not by APV (Fig. 3 A). The BDNF-PIII activation was repressed by nicardipine and by APV but was more resistant to APV at 50 mm than at 25 mm KCl (Fig. 3 B). These observations suggested that the Ca2+ influx through L-VDCC at 25 mm KCl was induced dependent upon an activation of NMDA-R but independently of NMDA-R activation at 50 mm KCl; that is, the L-VDCC at 25 mm KCl is unable to open by itself and needs the help of NMDA-R, which leads to the Ca2+ influx through L-VDCC, whereas that at 50 mm KCl is able to open without the mediation of NMDA-R. In support of this notion, the Ca2+ influx was almost abolished by APV at 25 mm KCl but not at 50 mmKCl (Fig. 2 B). The fact that the selective activation of L-VDCC by Bay-K8644 at 25 mm KCl increased the nicardipine-sensitive activation of BDNF-PI and abolished the APV-sensitive one (Fig. 4) also supported the above notion; that is, Bay-K8644 directly helped to open L-VDCC at 25 mm KCl, leading to the Ca2+ influx through L-VDCC without the mediation of NMDA-R.The L-VDCC activation mediated by NMDA-R at 25 mm KCl was thought to be due to a glutamate release induced by membrane depolarization and a subsequent activation of NMDA-R (19.Bruns D. Engers S. Yang C. Ossig R. Jeromin A. John R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1898-1910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which might lead to an increase in the membrane potential that rises as the KCl concentration in medium is elevated (20.Cooper D.M.F. Schells M.J. Thorn P. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27703-27707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test this notion, we added botulinus toxin to the culturing medium of 25 mm KCl to repress a possible glutamate release from neurons. However, botulinus toxin did not inhibit the increase in BDNF mRNA expression at 25 mm KCl (data not shown). The release of glutamate is also caused by a reversal of glutamate transporter, which can be induced by AMPA/kainate receptor activation (21.Berman F.W. Murray T.F. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, it is still unclear whether or not the glutamate release is involved in the NMDA-R activation induced by membrane depolarization at 25 mmKCl.That the Ca2+ influxes through not only L-VDCC but also NMDA-R and vice versa when the cortical neurons in culture are stimulated by high K+ (50 mm KCl) or glutamate, respectively, could additively influence the Ca2+-responsive gene expression was already pointed out by Hardingham et al. (22.Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Cruzalegui F.H. Bading H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirmed this notion by demonstrating that the Ca2+ influx through both Ca2+ channels is caused by either stimulation of membrane depolarization or NMDA (Fig. 2, A andB). Considering these observations, it seems essential to include the counterpart channel antagonist to L-VDCC or NMDA-R when stimulating the cortical neurons in culture with high K+ or NMDA to study the Ca2+ signalings specifically evoked via L-VDCC versus NMDA-R.Because the BDNF-PI activation was markedly repressed by nicardipine at both 25 and 50 mm KCl and resistant to APV at 50 mm KCl (Fig. 3 A), the BDNF-PI seems to respond to the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC but not to those evoked via NMDA-R. On the other hand, the BDNF promoter III activation at 50 mm KCl was sensitive to both APV and nicardipine (Fig. 3 B), indicating that BDNF-PIII can respond to the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC and NMDA-R. The BDNF-PIII activation at 25 mm KCl in the presence of nicardipine (Fig. 3 B) also seemed to be due to the Ca2+influx through NMDA-R induced by membrane depolarization at 25 mm KCl (Fig. 2 B). In support of these observations, the stimulation of NMDA-R in the presence of nicardipine activated BDNF-PIII but not BDNF-PI (Fig. 5 A). During the time course of activation, in addition, BDNF-PI remained activated by the Ca2+ influx through L-VDCC but not through NMDA-R for at least 24 h after stimulation, whereas BDNF-PIII remained activated by the Ca2+ influx through not only L-VDCC but also NMDA-R (Fig. 6). Thus, we clearly demonstrated that BDNF-PI predominantly responded to the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC, whereas BDNF-PIII responded to the Ca2+ influxes through L-VDCC and NMDA-R to almost the same degree.It has been reported that BDNF-PIII is activated by Ca2+signals evoked via L-VDCC through intracellular signaling routes involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV and CREB (4.Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 5.Shieh P.B. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that BDNF-PIII is also activated by Ca2+ signals evoked via NMDA-R and BDNF-PI predominantly by those evoked via L-VDCC. Quite recently, Hardingham et al. (22.Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Cruzalegui F.H. Bading H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) reported that the Ca2+influx through NMDA-R and L-VDCC induces distinct kinetics of CREB phosphorylation at serine 133; that is, although the Ca2+influx through NMDA-R and L-VDCC is initially equally potent at inducing CREB phosphorylation, CREB remained phosphorylated at serine 133 even 1 h after stimulation upon L-VDCC activation, whereas NMDA-R activation caused only a transient increase in CREB phosphorylation. We also observed that the CREB phosphorylation was sustained for longer than 1 h upon L-VDCC activation, which was caused by membrane depolarization at 50 mm KCl in the presence of APV, but such a sustained and strong CREB phosphorylation was not observed upon NMDA-R activation, which was caused by NMDA stimulation in the presence of nicardipine (data not shown), indicating that the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC and NMDA-R are transferred through different signaling pathways in terms of CREB phosphorylation. The c-fos promoter receives both the Ca2+ signals transduced by NMDA-R and L-VDCC through cAMP/calcium response element and serum response element which are located approximately −60 and −310 nucleotides on the c-fos promoter, respectively (6.Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6189-6202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems worth investigating whether the same Ca2+ signaling pathways are involved in the BDNF-PIII activation. In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that the phosphorylation of not only CREB at Ser-133 but also the CREB-binding protein, which facilitates the unwinding of DNA and interacts with the basal transcriptional machinery, is required for regulating the Ca2+signal-mediated gene expression (22.Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Cruzalegui F.H. Bading H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23.Hu S.-C. Chrivia J. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to investigate which transcriptional factor(s) and whether the CREB-binding protein is involved in the activation of BDNF-PI and BDNF-PIII controlled by Ca2+ signals.The fact that the induction levels of BDNF-PI and -PIII tended to be reduced from 25 mm to 50 mm KCl, although the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were higher at 50 mm than at 25 mm KCl (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), indicates that the higher the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, the stronger the repressive activities exerted on BDNF gene transcription, which might also account for the nonresponsiveness of BDNF-PI and -PIII above 75 mm KCl (Fig. 1 B). Thus, it seems likely that certain repressive activities are exerted on the BDNF gene transcription when the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is raised. On the other hand, the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC induce the BDNF gene activation more effectively than those evoked via NMDA-R because the L-VDCC activation induced the BDNF promoter activation higher than did the NMDA-activation (Fig.6 B), even though the Ca2+ uptake was lower upon the L-VDCC than NMDA-R activation (Figs. 2 B and5 B). This might be due to a difference in the localization of these channels in neurons or to different intracellular signaling machineries associated with these channels (24.Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 25.Arnold D.B. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems worth inquiring how the BDNF gene activation are regulated by the concentration or the localization of intracellular Ca2+, which could be controlled by L-VDCC and NMDA-R activation.The observation that the pattern of change in BDNF mRNA expression resembled that in BDNF-PIII activities (Figs. 2 A and3 B) indicates that the transcription controlled by BDNF-PIII and not by BDNF-PI mainly accounted for the BDNF mRNA expression in cultured cortical cells. In support of this observation, the basal promoter activity of BDNF-PIII was approximately 10–20-fold higher than that of BDNF-PI or -PII (data not shown). Using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method, furthermore, we found that the expression of exon I, II, and III but not exon IV transcripts were induced in rat cortical neurons under high K+ and the exon III transcripts were expressed more abundantly than the exon I or II ones under either high or low K+ (data not shown). Thus, the alternative BDNF gene promoters may confer not only a differential responsiveness to the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC and NMDA-R but also a differential efficacy of transcription initiation on the BDNF mRNA expression. The activation of BDNF promoter II showed the same sensitivities to APV and nicardipine as that of BDNF-PI (data not shown). However, it is still unknown whether the BDNF promoters I, II, and III are coordinately activated by Ca2+ signals. To assess this point, it is necessary to investigate whether the alternative BDNF gene promoters could be activated in the same or different neurons. The differential usages of BDNF gene promoters in neurons should be involved in controlling the multiple BDNF functions in mammalian nervous systems. A variety of genes whose products are involved in expressing neuronal functions including synaptic plasticity can be activated by the Ca2+ signals evoked via Ca2+ influx into neurons, which is associated with an electrical activity of neurons (1.Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The main sites for extracellular Ca2+ influx leading to an activation of gene expression are theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDA-R),1 a subtype of ion channels of glutamate receptors, and L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCC) (2.Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ influx through both sites evokes intracellular Ca2+ signals through several signaling routes mainly involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (3.Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 4.Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and extracellular signal-related protein kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (6.Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6189-6202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+signals are received by the Ca2+ signal-responsive DNA regulatory elements by a mediation of specific DNA-binding proteins, such as the cAMP/calcium response element and the serum response element, which are activated mainly by a specific binding of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and serum-responsive factor, respectively (6.Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6189-6202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Irrespective of the context of Ca2+signaling in neurons, however, the physiological role of the Ca2+ signalings evoked via NMDA-R versus L-VDCC in neurons, and the intracellular mechanisms for differentially conveying the Ca2+ signals for gene expression are still controversial. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family and plays a key role in the survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity of neurons (8.Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). The rat BDNF gene consists of four short exons, exons I, II, III, and IV, and a 3′ exon, exon V, encoding the mature BDNF protein, giving rise to eight species of BDNF transcripts each of which contains exon I, II, III, or IV and a long or short exon V (9.Timmusk T. Palm K. Medis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Four promoters were mapped upstream of exons I, II, III, and IV, respectively, which are differentially activated by the kainic acid-induced seizure in distinct regions of the rat brain (9.Timmusk T. Palm K. Medis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). It is becoming evident that the alternative promoters are used as a versatile mechanism to create diversity and flexibility in the regulation of gene expression (10.Ayoubi T.A. Van de Ven W.J.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to know the transcriptional regulation of BDNF gene promoters I, II, III, and IV for a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms controlled by BDNF. Although the Ca2+ signal-mediated activation of the BDNF gene has well been established (2.Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 11.Zafra F. hengerer B. Leibrock J. Thoenen H. Lindholm D.

Commun. 1996; 229: 788-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it remains unclear how the alternative promoters of the BDNF gene are regulated by the Ca2+ signals evoked via L-VDCC and NMDA-R. Using DNA transfection in primary rat cortical neuronal cell culture, the DNA elements responsible for the Ca2+ signal-mediated activation of BDNF promoter III have been identified (4.Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 5.Shieh P.B. Hu S.-C. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and furthermore, we have characterized the BDNF promoter I as a Ca2+ signal-responsive promoter (13.Tabuchi A. Sano K. Nakaoka R. Nakatani C. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14.Tabuchi A. Nakatani C. Nakaoka R. Naruse Y. Kojima T. Mori N. Tsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study, therefore, we examined whether the BDNF gene promoters I and III responded differentially or similarly to the Ca2+ signals evoked via NMDA-R or L-VDCC. During this study, we also found that the mode of BDNF gene activation changed as the KCl concentration in the medium was raised and that this change was mediated by changes in modes of Ca2+ influx into neurons dependent upon the level of membrane depolarization. DISCUSSIONAmong the many possible roles of alternative promoters, such as varying the efficiency of transcription initiation, varying the turnover or translation efficiency of mRNA isoforms with different leader exons, changing the tissue specificity, reacting differentially to some extracellular signals, developmentally regulating gene expression, and generating protein isomers differing at the amino terminus, it has been suggested that the alternative promoters of the BDNF gene are involved in the control of tissue- and brain region-specific expression of the gene (9.Timmusk T. Palm K. Medis M. Reintam T. Paalme V. Saarma M. Persson H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 475-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the other usages of alternative BDNF gene promoters is important to reveal the mechanisms controlling the neuronal functions mediated by BDNF. Because it has well been established that the expression of the BDNF gene can be controlled by the intracellular Ca2+ signals (2.Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 11.Zafra F. hengerer B. Leibrock J. Thoenen H. Lindholm D.

It has been proposed that all canalicular proteins are targeted via this indirect route in hepatocytes. We studied the membrane targeting of rat canalicular proteins by in vivo [35S]methionine metabolic labeling followed by preparation of highly purified Golgi membranes and canalicular (CMVs) and sinusoidal/basolateral (SMVs) membrane vesicles and subsequent immunoprecipitation. In particular, we compared membrane targeting of newly synthesized canalicular ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP (sister ofP-glycoprotein) with that of cCAM105. Significant differences were observed in metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments with regard to membrane targeting of these apical proteins. After a chase time of 15 min, cCAM105 appeared exclusively in SMVs, peaked at 1 h, and progressively declined thereafter. In CMVs, cCAM105 was first detected after 1 h and subsequently increased for 3 h. This findings confirm the transcytotic targeting of cCAM105 reported in earlier studies. In contrast, at no time point investigated were MDR1, MDR2, and SPGP detected in SMVs. In CMVs, MDR1 and MDR2 appeared after 30 min, whereas SPGP appeared after 2 h of labeling. In Golgi membranes, each of the ABC transporters peaked at 30 min and was virtually absent thereafter. These data suggest rapid, direct targeting of newly synthesized MDR1 and MDR2 from the Golgi to the bile canaliculus and transient sequestering of SPGP in an intracellular pool en route from the Golgi to the apical plasma membrane.

The amount of each ABC transporter in the canalicular membrane is regulated by the physiological demand to excrete bile acids. Intravenous administration of rats with taurocholate or dibutyryl cAMP rapidly and selectively increased the functional activity and amount of ABC transporters in the canalicular membrane. This increase was inhibited by prior administration of colchicine, which disrupts microtubules (11.Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar), and wortmannin, which inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (12.Misra S. Ujhazy P. Gatmaitan Z. Varticovski L. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26638-26644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that an intracellular microtubule-dependent transport mechanism that is sensitive to active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required to traffic ABC transporters to the canalicular membrane. In addition, lipid products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase directly regulate the ATP-dependent substrate transport activity of SPGP and MRP2 in the canalicular membrane (13.Misra S. Ujhazy P. Varticovski L. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5814-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that bile secretion requires intrahepatic trafficking and regulation of the canalicular ABC transporters. Membrane targeting of the newly synthesized canalicular ectoenzymes dipeptidyl peptidase IV, aminopeptidase N, and 5′-nucleotidase and the canalicular cell adhesion molecule cCAM105 (also known as HA4) has been studied in rat liver by in vivo metabolic pulse-chase labeling. After biosynthesis, these canalicular proteins are transferred from the Golgi to the basolateral membrane and subsequently reach the bile canaliculus only by transcytosis (14.Bartles J.R.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was proposed that all newly synthesized canalicular proteins, including canalicular ABC-type transporters, are targeted via this indirect route (16.Bartles J.R. Hubbard A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17.Roelofsen H. Soroka C.J. Keppler D. Boyer J.L. J.

Although the membrane targeting of newly synthesized canalicular ectoenzymes and cell adhesion molecule cCAM105 has been thoroughly studied, comparable investigations of canalicular ABC transporters have not been performed. In this study, we used metabolic pulse-chase labeling followed by subcellular fractionation of rat liver and immunoprecipitation to investigate the intracellular trafficking of newly synthesized canalicular proteins. In particular, we focused on membrane targeting of newly synthesized transporters of the MDR family, including SPGP, and compared their trafficking with that of cCAM105 and with the basolateral membrane resident asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R).1 Radiochemicals were supplied by NEN Life Science Products.

Expression of the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purification using glutathione-Sepharose beads were performed according to protocols provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A commercial service was employed to raise antibodies in rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA) using a standard protocol for immunization and bleeding. Groups of five male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) kept on a standard diet were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally) and were injected in the tail vein with 3.5 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (1175 Ci/mmol; Expre35S35S protein label, NEN Life Science Products) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. 15 min later, 50 mg of unlabeled methionine and 5 mg of unlabeled cysteine in 2.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were injected intraperitoneally. For investigation of membrane targeting, livers were removed after 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h and used for subcellular fractionation. Data presented are typical results observed in at least three sets of five rats. Previously published methods were combined, modified, and optimized for a high yield of canalicular, sinusoidal/basolateral, and Golgi membranes from a single rat liver (Fig.1). After gentle homogenation of rat liver, bile canaliculi remain attached to tight junctions and sediment with the low speed nuclear pellet. Canalicular membrane vesicles were prepared from the low speed pellet by nitrogen cavitation followed by calcium precipitation (21.Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Biempica L. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5183-5188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low speed supernatant was split and used for purification of basolateral membranes on a sucrose/Ficoll gradient (22.Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Arias I.M.

Excised rat liver (10–15 g, wet weight) was rapidly perfused with ice-cold SHCa buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmHEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.2 mm CaCl2supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin)) and homogenized in 50 ml of SHCa buffer with four strokes in a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was filtered through a double layer of cheesecloth; homogenized again with 15 strokes; diluted with SH buffer (SHCa buffer without CaCl2) to 140 ml; supplemented with 0.1m EGTA stock solution, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 1 mm; and centrifuged for 10 min at 1880 ×g (Beckman JA-14, 3500 rpm). The pellet and fluffy layer were collected and used for preparation of CMVs. The supernatant (∼130 ml) was split 1:1 and used for preparation of SMVs and Golgi membranes, respectively. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of SHCa buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g (Beckman JA-14, 4500 rpm). The resulting pellet was suspended in 50 ml of SHCa buffer, placed in a high pressure chamber (Parr Instrument Model 4635), and equilibrated with nitrogen at 850 p.s.i. for 15 min with shaking at 4 °C. Pressure was released within 3 min; and the contents of the chamber were homogenized with six strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer, diluted with SHCa buffer to 120 ml, and supplemented with 1 m CaCl2 stock solution to a final concentration of 10 mm. After incubation for 10 min on ice, the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 7600 × g(Beckman JA-14, 7000 rpm). The supernatant was filtered through fine weave cloth and centrifuged for 30 min at 47,000 × g(Beckman Ti-45, 27,000 rpm). The pellet was homogenized in 30 ml of SHCa buffer with six strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g (Beckman JA-17, 4500 rpm). The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 30 min at 47,000 × g (Beckman Ti-45, 27,000 rpm). The resulting pellet was homogenized in SHCa buffer at 3–4 mg/ml protein with a syringe and 24-gauge needle and stored at −80 °C until used. 65 ml of the first supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 5500 × g (Beckman JA-14, 7500 rpm). The resulting supernatant and fluffy layer were collected and centrifuged for 30 min at 22,000 × g (Beckman JA-14, 12,000 rpm). The pellet was resuspended in SH buffer containing 1 mmEGTA (total volume of 12 ml) and layered on two discontinuous gradients consisting of 1 ml of 60% sucrose, 23 ml of 23% sucrose and 4% Ficoll 400, and 7 ml of 20% sucrose. After centrifugation for 90 min at 130,000 × g in a swinging bucket rotor (Beckman SW 27, 27,000 rpm), the interphase between 20% sucrose and 23% sucrose and 4% Ficoll was collected, diluted six times with SHCa buffer, and centrifuged for 30 min at 47,000 × g (Beckman Ti-45, 27,000 rpm). The resulting pellet was homogenized in SHCa buffer at ∼10 mg/ml protein with a syringe and 24-gauge needle and stored at −80 °C until used. 65 ml of the first supernatant was homogenized with 10 strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer, supplemented with MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm, and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g (Beckman JA-14, 10,000 rpm). The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of SH buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged again for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The two supernatants from the 15,000 × g spins were combined and centrifuged for 60 min at 140,000 × g (Beckman Ti-45, 35,000 rpm). The pellet was resuspended in 12 ml of 1.25m sucrose and overlaid with 12 ml of 1.1 msucrose and 12 ml of 0.25 m sucrose in a 36-ml tube for gradient centrifugation. After centrifugation for 90 min at 130,000 × g (Beckman SW 27, 27,000 rpm), the interphase between 0.25 m sucrose and 1.1 msucrose was collected, diluted six times with SHCa buffer, and centrifuged for 30 min at 47,000 × g (Beckman Ti-45, 27,000 rpm). The resulting pellet was homogenized in SHCa buffer at 3–4 mg/ml protein with a syringe and 24-gauge needle and stored at −80 °C until used. Typical yields were 1.0–1.3 mg of membrane protein for CMV and Golgi preparations and 5–6 mg of protein for SMV preparations. 1 mg of protein of CMV, SMV, and Golgi preparations was solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, and 0.025 mNaPi, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% NaN3 and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate (40 mg of protein) was solubilized in 10 ml of the same buffer. The mixtures were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were precleared by adding 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads, shaken for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 ×g. The precleared supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody C219 (10 μg of IgG) and antisera from polyclonal anti-ASGP-R (20 μl) and anti-cCAM105 (20 μl) antibodies and LVT90 (20 μl). By repeated immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting, it was established that these conditions are sufficient to precipitate completely the respective antigen. The lysates were employed for precipitation with each antibody in a sequential fashion. The order in which the proteins were immunoprecipitated proved to be uncritical. The detergent extracts were supplemented with bovine serum albumin to 0.5% and incubated with the respective antibody for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added, and incubation with shaking at 4 °C was continued for 1 h. The beads were sedimented for 1 min at 16,000 × g, washed four times by repeated suspension in 1 ml of the lysis buffer (without octyl glucoside and protease inhibitors), and centrifuged for 1 min at 16,000 ×g. 30 μl of gel loading buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 8m urea, and 0.025% bromphenol blue) was added to the washed beads and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. To remove the Sepharose beads, the suspension was applied to a microcentrifuge column (Bio-Rad) and centrifuged for 2 min at 16,000 × g. The flow-through fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gel was fixed with 1-propanol/water/acetic acid (25:65:10), stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue in methanol/water/acetic acid (45:45:10), destained with methanol/water/acetic acid (20:75:5), and dried on filter paper (80 °C, 2 h, vacuum). The dried gel was exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette and read after 1 week with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. For Western blotting, polypeptides were electrotransferred (25.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). Antibodies were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by detection with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (NEN Life Science Products). The method of Lowry et al. (26.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for protein measurements with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The activities of marker enzymes were determined according to the following protocols: γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (27.Orlowski M. Meister A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), alkaline phosphatase (28.Walter K. Schütt C. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. II. Academic Press, New York1974: 856-864Google Scholar), Na,K-ATPase (29.Heidrich H.G. Kinne R. Kinne-Saffran E. Hannig K. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 232-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and galactosyltransferase (30.Sztul E. Kaplin A. Saucan L. Palade G. Cell. 1991; 64: 81-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The quality of the membrane preparations was determined by measuring the enrichment of marker enzymes (Table I). Marker enzymes for the canalicular membrane γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase were highly enriched only in CMVs (∼45-fold) as compared with the homogenate. A marker for the basolateral membrane Na,K-ATPase was slightly increased in Golgi fractions, below the detection limit in CMVs, and enriched 16-fold in SMVs. The enrichment of marker enzymes was comparable to that reported previously (21.Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Biempica L. Arias I.M. J. Biol.

Galactosyltransferase, a marker for Golgi membranes, was slightly enriched in SMVs, below the detection limit in CMVs, and 24-fold enriched in Golgi preparations. The yields of specific marker enzyme activities in CMVs and SMVs are consistent with data reported earlier (21.Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Biempica L. Arias I.M. J. Biol.

The quality of membrane preparations was further established by immunochemical methods. Monoclonal anti-β-COP antibody recognizes an epitope shared by the Golgi β-COP protein (110 kDa). Immunoblots probed with anti-β-COP antibody showed significant enrichment in Golgi membranes as compared with the homogenate, whereas β-COP was absent from canalicular and basolateral membranes (Fig.2). CMV and SMV preparations were further characterized by probing with antibodies against apical and basolateral membrane resident proteins in immunoblots. As shown in Fig. 4, basolateral ASGP-R was detected only in SMVs and was absent from CMVs, whereas antibodies against the canalicular transporters MDR1 and MDR2 and SPGP and MRP2 reacted exclusively with antigens in CMVs.Figure 4CMV/SMV distribution of hepatic membrane proteins. Rat liver CMVs (C) and SMVs (S), 10 mg each, were separated by SDS-PAGE; blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane; and probed with antibodies against the basolateral membrane resident ASGP-R and the bile canaliculus resident proteins MDR1 and MDR2 (detected with the C219 antibody (anti-MDR1/MDR2)), SPGP, the organic anion transporter MRP2, the ectoenzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), and the canalicular cell adhesion molecule cCAM105. Arrowheads indicate the positions of antigens.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We were interested in antibodies directed against canalicular ABC-type transporters that were suitable for immunoprecipitation. Among available antibodies, only monoclonal antibody C219 (anti-MDR1/MDR2) met this property. Therefore, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the recently cloned canalicular bile acid transporter SPGP. Alignments of amino acid sequences revealed high similarity/homology among rat MDR1 (31.Silverman J.A. Raunio H. Gant T.W. Thorreirsson S.S. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 106: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), MDR2 (32.Brown P.C. Thorgeirsson S.S. Snorri S. Silverman J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3885-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and SPGP (9.Gerloff T. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Madon J. Landmann L. Roth J. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10046-10050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar): MDR1 versusSPGP, 48/68%; MDR1 versus MDR2, 69/82%; and MDR1versus SPGP, 46/66%. A 90-amino acid peptide from the SPGP “linker” region that showed the lowest similarity/homology to the other MDR transporters was chosen as immunogen for the generation of anti-SPGP antibody LVT90. Monoclonal antibody C219 was raised against MDR1 constitutively overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and is directed against two hexapeptides located close to the ATP-binding sites in CHO-MDR1, VQAALD and VQEALD (33.Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Both recognition motifs are present in rat MDR1 and MDR2 at the same position. In rat SPGP, the corresponding sites are altered to VQEALN and VQTALD. In the first recognition sequence, aspartic acid, which is critical for antigen recognition (33.Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), was replaced by asparagine. In the second recognition sequence, glutamic acid was replaced by threonine. In immunoblots, the polyclonal anti-SPGP antibody LVT90 showed strong reaction with a 170-kDa protein in CMVs that was absent from SMVs (see Fig. 4). Preimmune serum did not show reactions with CMVs or SMVs. Reaction of LVT90 with CMVs was competed by addition of the glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein (data not shown). To test for possible cross-reactivity between C219 and LVT90, we performed immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting (Fig.3). A lysate of rat liver CMVs (500 μg) was immunoprecipitated first with anti-SPGP antibody LVT90 (lanes A) followed by anti-MDR1/MDR2 antibody C219 (lanes B). In a similar experiment, CMV lysate was first immunoprecipitated with C219 (lanes C) followed by LVT90 (lanes D). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with either LVT90 or C219. Reaction of LVT90 in immunoblots was observed only when LVT90 was used for immunoprecipitation. Whether LVT90 immunoprecipitation was before or after precipitation with C219 was uncritical. Furthermore, C219 immunoprecipitates showed no reaction with LVT90 in immunoblots. The same applied for C219 immunoblots. Positive reactions were observed only when C219 was used for the initial precipitation, and no reaction was observed with LVT90 precipitates. The sequence in which antibodies were employed for precipitation was not critical. These immunoprecipitation/blotting experiments indicate that there is no cross-reactivity between the C219 and LVT90 antibodies with regard to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Thus, C219 is specific for rat MDR1 and MDR2, and LVT90 is specific for rat SPGP. Western blots of purified CMVs and SMVs that were probed with antibodies against canalicular proteins are shown in Fig.4. Anti-dipeptidyl peptidase IV and anti-cCAM105 antibodies predominantly reacted with CMVs, and a small amount was regularly observed in SMVs. We explain the presence of these “canalicular” proteins in SMVs by the fact that these membrane proteins are initially transferred to the basolateral membrane after biosynthesis and subsequently reach the apical pole by transcytosis (14.Bartles J.R. Feracci H.M. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This scenario is in good accordance with detectable steady-state levels in SMVs. Under the same conditions, antibodies against the canalicular ABC-type transporters, C219 (anti-MDR1/MDR2), LVT90 (anti-SPGP), and EAG15 (anti-MRP2), exclusively recognized antigens in CMVs, which suggests that newly synthesized canalicular ABC transporters may not be initially trafficked to the basolateral plasma membrane. To test the hypothesis of direct apical targeting of canalicular ABC transporters in rat hepatocytes, we performed metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments. Rats were injected with [35S]methionine, and labeling of newly synthesized"

For example, the human caveolin-1 gene is localized to a suspected tumor suppressor locus (D7S522; 7q31.1) that is deleted in human cancers, including mammary carcinomas. However, little is known about the role of caveolins in regulating cell movement, a critical parameter in determining metastatic potential. Here, we examine the role of caveolin-1 in cell movement. For this purpose, we employed an established cellular model, MTLn3, a metastatic rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line. In this system, epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation induces rapid lamellipod extension and cell migration. Interestingly, we find that MTLn3 cells fail to express detectable levels of endogenous caveolin-1. To restore caveolin-1 expression in MTLn3 cells efficiently, we employed an inducible adenoviral gene delivery system to achieve tightly controlled expression of caveolin-1. We show here that caveolin-1 expression in MTLn3 cells inhibits EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension and cell migration and blocks their anchorage-independent growth. Under these conditions, EGF-induced activation of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is also blunted. Our results suggest that caveolin-1 expression in motile MTLn3 cells induces a non-motile phenotype.

Biochemical and morphological experiments have shown that a variety of signaling molecules are concentrated in these plasma membrane microdomains. This is particularly true of lipid-modified signaling molecules, such as Src family tyrosine kinases, H-Ras, eNOS, and heterotrimeric G-proteins (11.Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Furthermore, caveolin-1 plays an inhibitory role in many of these signaling events by interacting directly with the membrane-bound components of the involved pathways or their downstream elements. Because a number of signaling molecules inhibited by caveolin-1 are involved in cell growth and mitogenesis (e.g. Src family tyrosine kinases, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 receptor kinase, Neu tyrosine kinase, Ras, components of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade) (11.Li S.

In support of these observations, the human caveolin-1 gene is localized to a suspected tumor suppressor locus (D7S522; 7q31.1) that is deleted in a number of human cancers, including mammary carcinomas (5.Engelman J.A.

In addition, caveolin-1 is modified or down-regulated in cells transformed by activated oncogene products. For example, caveolin-1 was first described as a transformation-dependent substrate of v-Src in Rous sarcoma virus transformed fibroblasts (1.Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, caveolin-1 levels are reduced dramatically in H-Ras (G12V)- and v-Abl-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (23.Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and mutational activation of c-Neu down-regulates caveolin-1 expression (18.Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J.

Antisense-mediated reduction of caveolin-1 levels in normal NIH 3T3 cells leads to hyperactivation of p42/44 MAP kinase cascade, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and tumor formation in nude mice (24.Galbiati F. Volonté D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolin-1 expression may somehow regulate anchorage-dependent cell growth, contact inhibition, and/or migratory potential by acting as an inhibitor of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade. This hypothesis remains to be tested. Motile MTLn3 cells were first described as a spontaneously occurring lung metastasis clonally derived from 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma (25.Neri A. Welch D. Kawaguchi T. Nicolson G.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 507-517PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Welch D.R. Neri A. Nicolson G.L. Invasion Metastasis. 1983; 3: 65-80PubMed Google Scholar). EGF stimulation of MTLn3 cell motility has been used previously as a model to study the regulation of lamellipod extension and cell migration. EGF acts as a chemoattractant in a number of cultured cells, and EGF along with its cognate receptor (EGF-R) enhances the growth, migration, and invasion of a number of cancers (27.Blay J. Brown K.D.

Here, we examine the potential role of caveolin-1 in the regulation of cell movement by employing the well established MTLn3 cellular model. We find that MTLn3 cells fail to express detectable levels of endogenous caveolin-1, whereas the MTC cell line (the non-motile counterpart of MTLn3 cells) expresses significant levels of caveolin-1. In addition, we show that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the caveolin-1 cDNA to MTLn3 cells is sufficient to inhibit EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension and cell migration and to block the anchorage-independent growth of these cells in soft agar. Our results suggest that restoration of caveolin-1 expression in motile MTLn3 cells can induce a non-motile phenotype. The caveolin-1 mouse mAb 2297 and caveolin-2 mouse mAb 65 (used for immunoblotting (9.Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonté D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P.

The caveolin-1 rabbit pAb N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and the anti-Myc mouse mAb 9E10 (used for immunofluorescence) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (used for immunofluorescence) was purchased from Sigma. MTLn3 and MTC cell lines (kindly provided by Dr. J. E. Segall, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) were clonally derived from the parental 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma (25.Neri A. Welch D. Kawaguchi T. Nicolson G.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 507-517PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Neri A. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 28: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Normal human mammary epithelial cells were obtained from BioWhittaker/Clonetics, and the human mammary carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 (HTB-22) and T-47D (HTB-133) cells were obtained from ATCC. All other biochemicals used were of the highest purity available and were obtained from regular commercial sources. DNA manipulations, including ligations, bacterial transformation, and plasmid purification, were carried out using standard procedures. MTLn3 and MTC cells were grown in alpha minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. NIH 3T3 cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing 10% donor bovine serum and antibiotics. Normal human mammary epithelial cells and the human mammary carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47D) were maintained as described by the suppliers (Clonetics and ATCC, respectively). All cells were passaged at ∼ 60–80% confluence. The adenoviral vector (pAd-tet) used consisted of a tetracycline-regulatable expression cassette (a heptamer oftetO sequences preceding a CMV immediate early promoter). The full-length cDNA for caveolin-1 (canine) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a c-Myc epitope tag fused to the COOH terminus (35.Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M.C. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the transfer vector pAd-tet usingSalI (5′) and NotI (3′) restriction sites. The correct orientation and sequence of the insert were verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells containing the E1 early gene region of the adenovirus type 5 genome were subsequently used to package the adenovirus by co-transfection of 293 cells with the SpnI restriction fragment of pAD-tet-caveolin-1 (pAd-cav-1) and the large right end fragment of the Ad5/DE1DE3 genome (adenovirus type 5 genome lacking the E1 and E3 early gene regions). Positive plaques were purified and expanded in 293 cells, and virus titers were determined byA 260 and plaque assay as described previously (37.Acsadi G. Jani A. Massie B. Simoneau M. Holland P. Blaschuk K. Karpati G. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1994; 3: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The adenoviral vectors containing tetracycline-regulatable green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) and the CMV-driventet-controlled transactivator (Ad-tTA) were constructed similarly. A Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line, which stably expresses tTA, was used to assess the feasibility of adenovirus mediated caveolin-1 gene transfer (38.Barth A.I.M. Pollack A.L. Altschuler Y. Mostov K.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cells grown in six-well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well were incubated with Ad-cav-1 with an m.o.i. of 50–200 plaque-forming units/cell in serum-free medium for 1 h, followed by growth in complete medium for 2 days. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting (see below). For the expression of caveolin-1 by Ad-cav-1 in MTLn3 cells, subconfluent cells were co-infected with Ad-cav-1 together with Ad-tTA (transactivator) for 1 h in serum-free α-MEM and grown in complete medium for 1–2 days. Cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-1 IgG. Various m.o.i. values of Ad-cav-1 and Ad-tTA were employed to achieve optimal levels of caveolin-1 expression. To determine the infection efficiency, MTLn3 cells were grown on coverslips in a 24-well plate at 4 × 104 cells/well and co-infected with Ad-cav-1 and Ad-tTA at m.o.i. values of 50–300. One day post-infection, the cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. As a control, Ad-GFP was used to co-infect MTLn3 cells together with Ad-tTA, and the optimal m.o.i. values for Ad-GFP were also determined. To achieve more than an ∼80–90% infection rate, we determined the optimal m.o.i. values for Ad-cav-1 plus Ad-tTA or Ad-GFP plus Ad-tTA to be ∼100 for each. These m.o.i. values were used for infection in subsequent experiments, unless indicated otherwise. Cells, cultured in their respective media, were washed with PBS and incubated with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 60 mm octyl glucoside) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations were quantitated using the BCA reagent (Pierce), and the volume required for 10 μg of protein was determined. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (to visualize protein bands) followed by immunoblot analysis. All subsequent wash buffers contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, which was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% non-fat dry milk (Carnation) for the blocking solution and 1% bovine serum albumin for the antibody diluent. Primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000 dilution, Transduction Laboratory) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies with the Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Infected cells grown in six-well plates were harvested at different times post-infection, and exogenous caveolin-1 levels were analyzed by immunoblotting. Alternatively, to monitor the time course of de novo caveolin-1 synthesis, metabolic labeling was performed on consecutive days post-infection. Briefly, cells were incubated in methionine-free α-MEM for 30 min and then labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) for 2 h. After washing once with PBS, the cells were extracted for 1 h on ice with lysis buffer (see “Immunoblot Analysis”). COOH-terminally Myc epitope-tagged caveolin-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using mAb 9E10, which is directed against the Myc epitope (11.Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The growth in soft agar assay was performed as we described previously (23.Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Infected MTLn3 cells grown in six-well plates were trypsinized and counted twice with a hemocytometer. Approximately 2.5 × 104 cells were suspended in 3 ml of α-MEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.33% SeaPlaque low melting temperature agarose (FMC Bioproducts). The suspension was plated in a 60-mm dish containing a 2-ml layer of solidified α-MEM, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5% SeaPlaque agarose. Three 60-mm dishes were used for each experimental condition. The cells were allowed to settle at the interface between these layers for 30 min at 37 °C, and plates were hardened at room temperature for an additional 30 min before being returned to 37 °C. Cells were fed every 5 days by overlaying with 2 ml of complete medium containing 0.33% SeaPlaque agarose. After 10–15 days, the plates were examined under a microscope at low magnification (×4 or ×6), and the colonies were counted. Experimental values represent the average number of colonies in the three 60-mm plates for each experimental condition; error bars represent the observed standard deviation among the three plates. When comparing uninfected MTLn3 cells with MTC cells, only foci with a diameter of > 400 μm were considered; five independent fields were counted for each cell line. Subconfluent MTLn3 cells grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates were virally transduced 1 day before immunofluorescence staining. The staining procedure was performed as we described previously with minor modifications (11.Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Briefly, MTLn3 cells infected with Ad-tTA and either Ad-cav-1 or Ad-GFP were fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 2% para-formaldehyde, rinsed with PBS, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. The cells were then incubated in permeabilization buffer (PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min, washed with PBS, and labeled with a 1:400 dilution of anti-caveolin-1 rabbit IgG (pAb N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 60 min. The GFP-infected cells were not labeled directly because they can be visualized by autofluorescence. After rinsing three times with PBS, a secondary antibody (7.5 μg/ml) (lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG) was added for a period of 60 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and slides were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). A Bio-Rad MR600 confocal fluorescence microscope was used for visualization of the bound secondary antibody and GFP. Experiments were performed essentially as described previously by Segall and colleagues (32.Segall J.E. Tyerech S. Boselli L. Masseling S. Helft J. Chan A. Jones J. Condeelis J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). MTLn3 cells were plated on collagen I-coated MATTEK tissue culture dishes at a density of 2,500 cells/cm2. One day later, the cells were virally infected and cultured for an additional 24 h. The infected cells were serum starved for 3 h in serum-free buffer (α-MEM in 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.35% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then treated with 5 nmmurine EGF (Sigma) in the same buffer for 3 min at 37 °C. The cells were fixed immediately with 3.7% formaldehyde (in PBS) for 5 min at 37 °C and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 20 min. After washing five times with PBS and incubating in blocking buffer for 30 min, the cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (1 μm; to visualize F-actin) for 20 min in a humidified chamber. The cells were washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated with antibodies directed against the c-Myc epitope for 1 h to detect caveolin-1 expression. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing three times with blocking buffer followed by two washing with PBS. Bound antibodies were visualized with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody probe. Coverslips were mounted on the MATTEK dishes with an anti-fade solution (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence images were acquired with an NA1.4 × 60 objective using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope. Images of the distribution of F-actin and caveolin-1 were taken using rhodamine and fluorescein filters, respectively. Merged images from the same field were created using Adobe Photoshop. A 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe) was used to study the chemotactic response to EGF, following the manufacturer's instructions. The chamber was washed thoroughly before use to remove any residue of chemoattractants. Nucleopore filters (8-μm pore size) were coated with rat tail collagen I in PBS (27 μg/ml) for 2 h. After filling the lower wells of the chamber with MEMH (α-MEM, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 5 nm EGF, the filter membrane was laid carefully over the lower wells, and the whole chamber was assembled. An equal number of cells (2 × 104/well) were suspended in MEMH and loaded into the upper wells. The chamber was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells that did not migrate across the filter were scraped, whereas the cells that traveled across were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (in PBS), washed in water, and stained in hematoxylin overnight. After a brief destaining in water, the filter was mounted between two glass plates using 90% glycerol (in PBS). The stained cells on the filter were counted under a microscope. MTLn3 cells were infected with Ad-cav-1 or Ad-GFP, with or without Ad-tTA. One day post-infection, cells were incubated with 5 nmmurine EGF for 30 min. The cells were lysed in hot 1% SDS lysis buffer with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Activation of ERK was detected with a phospho-specific antibody probe that only recognizes the active phosphorylated form of ERK; total expression of ERK was monitored with a phospho-independent antibody probe (New England Biolabs). Untreated cells (without EGF treatment) were also used to determine basal levels of phosphorylated and total ERK. Caveolin-1 levels have been shown to be reduced or absent in mammary tumors and tumor-derived cell lines (18.Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The MTLn3 and MTC cell lines are, respectively, motile and non-motile sublines derived from a single rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (13762NF; first described in Refs.25.Neri A. Welch D. Kawaguchi T. Nicolson G.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 507-517PubMed Google Scholar and 36.Neri A. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 28: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (top panel), caveolin-1 is expressed in the non-motile MTC subline, whereas it is clearly absent in motile MTLn3 cells. Also, note that the widely used human mammary carcinoma-derived cell lines, MCF-7 and T-47D, show an absence of caveolin-1 expression compared with normal human mammary epithelial cells and NIH 3T3 cells (a cell line with robust caveolin-1 expression). In addition, the use of a highly sensitive anti-caveolin-1 rabbit IgG (pAb N-20) also failed to detect any caveolin-1 protein expression in the same cell lines (Fig. 1,middle panel). Although reductions in caveolin-2 levels do not necessarily correlate with a transformed phenotype (23.Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Here we report a novel effect of Nef on lymphocyte signaling, which is mediated via a T cell receptor (TCR)-independent contribution of Nef to induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a transcription factor that plays a central role in coordinating T cell activation. Expression of Nef did not significantly alter the basal level of NFAT activity in Jurkat cells nor the increased activity following T cell receptor stimulation by anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 + anti-CD28. We also mimicked NFAT induction by TCR triggering by simultaneous activation of the Ras and calcium signaling pathways with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, respectively. Strikingly, whereas activation of either of these pathways individually did not induce NFAT activity in control cells, in Nef-expressing cells phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment alone resulted in a 100-fold increase in NFAT-directed gene expression. Experiments with different dominant negative mutant signaling proteins, inhibitory chemicals, and Lck-deficient Jurkat cells revealed that this effect was mediated via activation of calcineurin by Nef-induced changes in calcium metabolism, but was independent of TCR-associated signaling events. This ability of Nef to substitute for triggering of the calcium pathway in induction of NFAT could promote activation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected T cells in response to stimuli mediated via TCR or other cell surface receptors under conditions when activation of Ras rather than calcium signaling would otherwise predominate.

Studies in cell culture have revealed a number of functions for Nef, including enhancement of HIV replication kinetics and particle infectivity, down-regulation of cell surface expression of CD4 and major histocompatability complex I, and modulation of intracellular signaling. In agreement with a role in signal transduction, Nef has been reported to bind to a large number of proteins involved in cellular signaling cascades (for a review, see Refs. 1.Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2.Renkema G.H. Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D268-D283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Piguet V. Trono D. Rev. Med. Virol. 1999; 9: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).An extreme example of the potential of Nef to alter cellular signaling is provided by the malignant transformation of fibroblasts by the mutant Nef allele of the SIVpbj strain (4.Du Z. Lang S.M. Sasseville V.G. Lackner A.A. Ilyinskii P.O. Daniel M.D. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 665-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Also, co-expression in rat fibroblasts of native Nef and the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck can lead to malignant transformation of these cells via an increased enzymatic activity of Hck (5.Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Stevenson and colleagues (6.Swingler S. Mann A. Jacque J. Brichacek B. Sasseville V.G. Williams K. Lackner A.A. Janoff E.N. Wang R. Fisher D. Stevenson M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 997-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that in infected macrophages Nef could cause secretion of chemotactic and mitogenic cytokines, which in turn could render resting T cell susceptible to HIV infection. In addition to acting via such paracrine mechanisms, Nef has also been shown to alter signal transduction of T cells directly. However, most such studies have indicated that the role of Nef is to inhibit T cell receptor (TCR)-induced signaling events, such as induction of the transcription factors NF-κB and activating protein-1 (AP-1) and cell surface expression of CD69 (7.Niederman T.M.

On the other hand, some reports have concluded that Nef has neither positive nor negative effects on T cell signaling (13.Schwartz O. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Heard J.M. Danos O. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14.Page K.A. van Schooten W.C. Feinberg M.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3776-3787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Nevertheless, because T cell activation positively correlates with HIV replication, it would seem logical that the effects of Nef on T cell activation pathways would be positive, and it could be speculated that the opposite results might have somehow arisen via a paradoxical manifestation of the regulatory potential of Nef. Although this hypothesis is attractive, there has been only limited evidence that Nef could under any conditions contribute to T cell activation. Hyperactivation of T lymphocytes has been observed in Nef transgenic mice (15.Skowronski J. Parks D. Mariani R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The SIVpbj Nef allele has been shown to enable this virus to productively infect resting peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and activate T cells in these cultures (4.Du Z. Lang S.M. Sasseville V.G. Lackner A.A. Ilyinskii P.O. Daniel M.D. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 665-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This unusual property of SIVpbj Nef is because of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif created by mutations in its amino terminus (16.Du Z. Ilyinskii P.O. Sasseville V.G. Newstein M. Lackner A.A. Desrosiers R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4157-4161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Luo W. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9531-9537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression on the cell surface of a Nef chimera containing the extra- and transmembrane parts of CD8 can result in activation of several signaling cascades in Jurkat T-lymphoid cells (18.Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, as in the case of SIVpbj Nef, it is not clear how well the effects caused by the CD8-Nef fusion protein reflect the normal function of Nef. Desrosiers and colleagues (19.Alexander L. Du Z. Rosenzweig M. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. J.

Perhaps related to this observation, two groups have recently shown that under certain experimental conditions HIV-1 Nef can clearly synergize (rather than interfere) with TCR stimulation as measured by TCR-induced IL-2 secretion or other indicators of T cell activation (20.Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21.Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).In this study we have examined the ability of HIV-1 Nef to influence basal and stimulated levels of transcription directed by NFAT, a pivotal transcription factor that coordinates the effects of two important signaling pathways upon activation of T cell gene expression (22.Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 23.Crabtree G.R.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). We did not find evidence of positive or negative modulation by Nef of TCR-stimulated NFAT activation. Instead, we report here that Nef can activate calcium signaling in T lymphocytes independently of TCR, and thereby potently synergize with inducers of the Ras pathway to cause a dramatic (∼100-fold) increase in NFAT-dependent transcription.RESULTSTriggering of the TCR results in induction of NFAT-dependent transcription via simultaneous activation of calcium/calcineurin and Ras/MAPK pathways (22.Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 24.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

To investigate if expression of HIV-1 Nef could substitute for TCR stimulation in activating these pathways, we transfected Jurkat T lymphoid cells with a reporter plasmid expressing luciferase under the control of three tandem short binding sites for NFAT (-286 to -257 of human IL-2 enhancer; Ref. 28.Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with or without a Nef expression vector. Twenty hours after transfection NFAT-dependent luciferase activity in these cells was analyzed either without further treatment or following a 4-h stimulation with a calcium/calcineurin pathway-activating ionophore (A23187; 2 μm), a Ras/MAPK pathway-activating phorbol ester (PMA, 100 nm), or a combination of these (Fig. 1).As expected, stimulation of either pathway alone did not result in significant NFAT activation, but co-stimulation with PMA plus ionophore caused a robust increase (∼150-fold) in luciferase activity. A small (∼2-fold) but reproducible increase in NFAT-dependent transcription was observed in Nef-transfected cells that were left unstimulated. However, when Nef-transfected cells were treated with PMA a 100-fold increase in NFAT-driven transcription was observed. The addition of ionophore to Nef-transfected and PMA-stimulated cells caused only a small (∼2-fold) additional increase in NFAT activity. These results suggested that Nef could activate the calcium arm but not the Ras arm of TCR signaling.We also examined the effect of Nef expression on NFAT activity after anti-CD3-mediated TCR triggering. Nef expression did not enhance or inhibit NFAT activation in cells stimulated by anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 co-ligation (Fig. 1). Similar negative results were observed regardless of whether suboptimal or saturating concentrations of anti-CD3 were used (data not shown). Thus, despite the ability of Nef to synergize with PMA stimulation in inducing NFAT, no potentiation with TCR stimulation was observed, suggesting that the Ras pathway rather than the calcium pathway is limiting in TCR-mediated NFAT induction.To confirm that our observations are not unique to the NL4–3/R71 allele of Nef, which is derived from a laboratory-adapted isolate of HIV-1 (25.Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we also subcloned into the same potent expression vector (pEF-BOS) the Nef gene of the HIV-1 SF2 isolate (29.Sanchez-Pescador R. Power M.D. Barr P.J. Steimer K.S. Stempien M.M. Brown-Shimer S.L. Gee W.W. Renard A. Randolph A. Levy J.A. Dina D. Luciw P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), which has not been passaged extensively before its molecular cloning and whose Nef gene is more similar to sequences obtained directly from patients (30.Shugars D.C. Smith M.S. Glueck D.H. Nantermet P.V. Seillier-Moiseiwitsch F. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that SF2 Nef was equally if not more potent than NL4–3/R71 Nef in activating NFAT in PMA-treated Jurkat cells and also did not positively or negatively modulate TCR-induced NFAT activity (data not shown). Thus, the ability to contribute to NFAT activation via the calcium signaling appears to be a general property of different HIV-1 Nef alleles.Although Jurkat cells are a widely used model for studies on T lymphocyte activation, we also examined the effect of Nef in other T lymphocytic human cell lines. Like in Jurkat cells, PMA treatment of A3.01 cells did not induce the expression of the NFAT-luciferase reporter when transfected with the control vector (empty pEF-BOS) but did result in a marked NFAT activation (∼10-fold) when co-transfected with Nef (data not shown). Whereas the magnitude of this effect was not as great as that of Nef + PMA in Jurkat cells, it was in accordance with a comparably smaller activation of NFAT-mediated transcription (30–40-fold) seen in A3.01 cells also in response to PMA + ionophore treatment (data not shown). Likewise, we were also able to consistently observe a small (2–3-fold) induction of NFAT by Nef + PMA in MT-4 cells, even if PMA + ionophore stimulation of these cells resulted in only a modest 6-fold increase in NFAT-dependent luciferase expression (data not shown). Thus, whereas the contribution of Nef to NFAT activation was most pronounced in Jurkat cells, this effect could also be observed in other T cell lines, suggesting that it is mediated by a mechanism that has general biological significance.To study the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic NFAT activation by Nef and PMA, we co-transfected Jurkat cells with dominant negative (DN) mutants of signaling molecules known to act at distinct positions in TCR-initiated signaling cascades (Fig.2). Expression of either DN-Ras or DN-MEKK1, two potent blockers of Ras signaling leading to the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (31.Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) efficiently blocked NFAT activation induced by Nef plus PMA. This result confirmed that the synergistic effect of PMA stimulation with Nef was indeed mediated via the Ras pathway. As expected, by interfering with the Ras arm of TCR-signaling, DN-Ras and DN-MEKK1 also inhibited anti-CD3-stimulated NFAT induction.Figure 2Inhibition of NFAT activation by Nef plus PMA or anti-CD3 stimulation by dominant negative signaling proteins.Jurkat cells were transfected with a NFAT reporter together with Nef (dark bars) or a control vector (light bars) as in Fig. 1, except that expression vectors for the DN version of Ras, MEKK1, or PAK1 were also included in some transfections, as indicated. Nef-transfected cells were stimulated with PMA, and the control cells were stimulated with anti-CD3. Shown are mean values of luciferase activity from duplicate transfections from one of several similar experiments expressed as a percentage of the values as compared with corresponding cells that received no DN plasmids. The latter were normalized to 100% from their original values of 5559 (anti-CD3-stimulated control cells) and 16590 (PMA-stimulated Nef-transfected cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Weiss and colleagues (32.Yablonski D. Kane L.P. Qian D. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5647-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have recently shown that PAK1 plays a critical role in TCR signaling by acting at a proximal step downstream of Lck, Cdc42, and Vav but before the calcium and Ras pathways bifurcate. Although we could confirm the ability of DN-PAK1 to block anti-CD3-stimulated NFAT activity, it had only a very minor effect on Nef-induced NFAT activation (Fig. 2). As expected, DN-PAK1 did not inhibit NFAT-directed gene transcription in response to PMA + ionophore treatment (data not shown). This observation suggested that Nef did not mediate its co-stimulatory function by interacting with TCR or associated factors. To substantiate this conclusion, we tested the ability of Nef to activate NFAT in the Jurkat-derived J.CaM1 cells, which are deficient in Lck (Fig. 3) (33.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Lck is the major Src kinase of T cells, plays a critical role as the initiation of intracellular TCR signaling (34.Mustelin T. Immunity. 1994; 1: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and has also been suggested as one of the cellular partners of Nef (10.Collette Y. Dutartre H. Benziane A.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6701-6708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, no NFAT activation was seen in anti-CD3-stimulated J.CaM1 cells, whereas a response similar to that seen in Jurkat cell was observed following PMA plus ionophore treatment. Notably, the ability of Nef expression to induce NFAT in these Lck-negative cells was not compromised, providing further proof that this effect is independent of TCR signaling.Figure 3Lck is not required for Nef-mediated activation of NFAT. Lck-negative J.CaM1 cells were transfected and treated as described for their parental Jurkat cells in Fig. 1. The mean increase in luciferase values from duplicate transfected J.CaM1 cells of a representative experiment as compared with unstimulated control are shown in a logarithmic scale on the y axis and indicated numerically under each bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize Nef-induced NFAT activation, we tested a panel of chemicals for their ability to block this effect. To confirm that these agents did not decrease cell viability or the ability to respond to the PMA co-stimulation, we compared in parallel the effect of the same compounds on PMA-induced activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. As shown in Fig.4 preincubation with cyclosporin A (200 nm), a potent inhibitor of calcineurin (36.Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar) efficiently blocked NFAT activation induced by Nef plus PMA but caused only a modest reduction in PMA-stimulated NF-κB-driven luciferase expression (35% decrease from 1,918,224 to 1,250,188 relative units; data not shown).Figure 4Comparison of the sensitivity of NFAT activation by Nef plus PMA or anti-CD3 stimulation to chemical inhibitors of calcium/calcineurin signaling, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or Src kinases. Jurkat cells were transfected with Nef or with a control vector and stimulated with PMA or anti-CD3, respectively, as described in Fig. 2, except that no DN plasmids were included. Instead, 30 min before PMA or anti-CD3 stimulation was applied the transfected cultures were supplemented with cyclosporin A (200 nm), EGTA (500 μm), wortmannin (WM; 200 μm) or PP1 (5 nm). As in Fig. 2, the mean luciferase activities from duplicate transfections of a representative experiment are expressed relative (%) to values from similarly transfected cells that were not treated with inhibitors, and normalized to 100% from 11486 (anti-CD3-stimulated control cells) and 19171 (PMA-stimulated Nef-transfected cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Together with the observation that ionophore did not significantly potentiate the effect of Nef (Fig. 1), this finding suggested that Nef acts in the calcium pathway upstream of calcineurin and probably by regulating intracellular calcium concentration. To test if prevention of calcium influx from extracellular sources could block the effect of Nef on NFAT, we supplemented the medium of the transfected Jurkat cells with 500 μm calcium chelating agent EGTA. As seen in Fig.4., this efficiently blocked NFAT activation in Nef-transfected plus PMA-stimulated cells but did not significantly affect PMA-induced NF-κB-activated luciferase expression (17% decrease; data not shown).Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been implicated as an effector molecule in TCR signaling (37.Eder A.M. Dominguez L. Franke T.F. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28025-28031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and in regulation of calcium metabolism (38.Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39.Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The addition of 200 μm wortmannin, an irreversible inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, resulted in significant but not complete blocking of anti-CD3-stimulated NFAT activity (Fig. 4). By contrast, wortmannin failed to decrease the effect of Nef on NFAT, indicating that the catalytic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was not involved in this process.Finally, we tested PP1, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with relative specificity toward the Src family kinases (40.Liu Y. Bishop A. Witucki L. Kraybill B. Shimizu E. Tsien J Ubersax J. Blethrow J. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We found PP1 (5 nm) to be an efficient inhibitor of anti-CD3-induced NFAT activation, whereas it only had a minimal effect on NFAT activity induced by Nef plus PMA (Fig. 4). This observation was in good agreement with our results using the Lck-negative J.CaM1 cells and indicated that activation of the calcium/calcineurin pathway by Nef was also independent of other Src kinases, such as Fyn, which has been implicated in calcium regulation via the TCR (41.Rigley K. Slocombe P. Proudfoot K. Wahid S. Mandair K. Bebbington C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1136-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Hall C.G. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Science. 1993; 261: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe present study describes a strong positive effect by wild-type HIV-1 Nef on T cell signaling. This effect was found to be mediated via activation of the calcium/calcineurin pathway and thus was strongly synergistic with the Ras pathway in inducing NFAT-dependent gene expression. Notably, this contribution of Nef to NFAT activation did not require TCR stimulation and was not dependent on the activity of the TCR-associated signaling protein complex.Although some previous studies have also reported positive effects by Nef on T cell activation, in these cases the action of Nef has been mediated through modulation of TCR signaling.

Med. 1999; 189: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)) has been reported to be sufficient to activate T cells, apparently by mimicking extracellular TCR ligation via action of Nef on the intracellular components of the TCR signaling complex. Although a similar dominant function for wild-type Nef has not been shown, it has recently been clearly demonstrated that native HIV-1 Nef has the potential to cooperate with TCR stimulation in promoting T cell activation (20.Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21.Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this enhancement is still unknown but was suggested to involve a lowered threshold for T cell activation caused by Nef-mediated priming of the TCR signaling complex (20.Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21.Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, why other studies have concluded that the effect of Nef on TCR signaling is negative (such as Ref. 12.Iafrate A.J. Bronson S. Skowronski J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or that Nef does not modify the outcome of TCR stimulation at all (such as Ref. 14.Page K.A. van Schooten W.C. Feinberg M.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3776-3787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our present data concur best with the latter conclusion, as we saw little or no effect by Nef on NFAT activity induced by anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation. The variables that account for these differential effects by Nef on TCR signaling will need to be clarified by future research and could provide important insights into Nef function.Whatever the role of Nef in modulating TCR signaling will prove to be, our current data indicate that Nef can also promote T cell activation by a different mechanism that involves a more direct effect on calcium/calcineurin-regulated cellular processes. One reason why this novel function of Nef has not been revealed by earlier studies could be that these may have focused on transcriptional effects induced by Nef alone or addressed a possible co-stimulatory role of Nef only in the context of TCR activation, which in itself results in the activation of calcium signaling. Furthermore, the NFAT-inducing effect of Nef described here requires a relatively high level of Nef expression. We have noted that Nef expression in transiently transfected Jurkat cells was significantly lower if a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven vector (pcDNA3) was used instead of pEF-BOS and that this lower level of Nef expression was insufficient to cause any increase in NFAT activity in PMA-treated Jurkat cells. 2A. Manninen, unpublished results. Thus, the expression levels achieved in earlier studies may not have been as high as the relatively strong expression of Nef used here, which might better recapitulate the abundance of Nef thought to be produced in acutely HIV-infected lymphocytes (45.Robert-Guroff M. Popovic M. Gartner S. Markham P. Gallo R.C. Reitz M.S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The d"

Here we compare the kinetics of S1S2-agonist binding to those of the periplasmic binding proteins and show that the reaction involves an initial rapid association, followed by slower conformational changes that stabilize the complex: “docking” followed by “locking.” The motion detected here reflects the mechanism by which the energy of glutamate binding is converted into protein conformational changes within S1S2 alone. In the intact channel, these load-free conformational changes are harnessed and possibly modified as the agonist binding reaction is used to drive channel opening and subsequent desensitization. Using mutagenesis, key residues in each step were identified, and their roles were interpreted in light of a published S1S2 crystal structure. In contrast to the Venus flytrap proposal, which focuses on motion between the two lobes as the readout for agonist binding, we argue that smaller, localized conformational rearrangements allow agonists to bridge the cleft, consistent with published hydrodynamic measurements.

The functional channels are oligomeric assemblies of 100-kDa subunits that can be assigned to one of three subfamilies: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), N-methyl-d-aspartate, and kainate receptors (4.Hollmann M.

Depending on the agonist and receptor subtype involved, the channels then inactivate or desensitize (7.Kiskin N.I. Krishtal O.A. Tsyndrenko A. Neurosci.

Mutagenesis experiments have located the GluR agonist-binding site in a domain distant from the ion channel gate (14.Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This implies that the presence of agonist in the binding site is communicated to the channel by means of conformational changes that propagate through the protein. This coupling of the state of the pore to the conformation of the agonist-binding site is reflected, for example, in different affinities for the resting and desensitized states of various receptors (the “binding-gating problem”) (4.Hollmann M.

It can be expressed as a soluble fusion protein (S1S2) with a pharmacological profile similar to that of the intact solubilized receptor, at least for AMPA receptor subunits (17.Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Studies of S1S2-agonist binding can provide insight into conformational changes within the domain, decoupled from the subsequent rearrangements (i.e. channel gating and desensitization) that they drive in the intact molecule. These changes may reflect either stabilization of a pre-existing conformation or induction of a novel conformation, although we speak here of their being “driven” or “induced” by agonist binding for the sake of simplicity. S1S2 is structurally related to the periplasmic binding proteins (PBP), bacterial proteins that bind metabolites in the cleft between two lobes. X-ray crystallography and solution scattering measurements on PBP reveal that the ligand first docks against lobe I in the open cleft and is then trapped by a dramatic cleft closure in the so-called “Venus flytrap” mechanism (22.Shilton B.H.

It has been suggested that a similar lobe closure occurs in the ligand-binding domain of the GluR and that this closure acts as the trigger for channel gating and/or desensitization (19.Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21.Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.-Q. Gouaux J.E.

However, a dramatic lobe closure is not strictly required for ligand binding even among PBP family members,e.g. if the ligand can bridge the open cleft (30.Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) or if oligomerization constrains the conformational flexibility (31.Mowbray S.L. Björkman A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We suggest that both of these conditions may be fulfilled by GluR. The crystallographic structure of an S1S2 domain core in complex with kainate has provided a detailed snapshot of its interaction with a ligand that induces unusually rapid (and weaker) desensitization in AMPA receptors compared with glutamate or AMPA. As a result, whole-cell currents induced by kainate appear non-desensitizing (32.Patneau D.K. Vyklicky Jr., L. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This x-ray structure has been interpreted as supporting a Venus flytrap mechanism (21.Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.-Q. Gouaux J.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We have pursued a parallel biophysical comparison of the bound and free states of S1S2 to understand the nature and dynamics of the conformational changes induced by the binding of different ligands. In a first approach, we showed by solution scattering techniques that there is no reduction in the radius of gyration of S1S2 upon agonist binding, indicating that the magnitude of any conformational change in the domain must be considerably smaller than for the PBP (33.Abele R. Svergun D. Keinänen K. Koch M.J.H. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10949-10957Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism measurements confirm that there are no significant changes in secondary structure content upon glutamate binding (34.Abele R. Biochemische und Biophysikcalische Charakterisiervng Extrazellulärer Fragmente der Ionotropen Glutamatrezeptoruntereinheit GluRD. Ph.D. thesis. Ruprecht-Karls-Universität, Heidelberg, Germany1998Google Scholar). Here, we present an analysis of the affinity and kinetics of agonist binding to S1S2 from the AMPA receptor GluRD, monitored using an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence signal and stopped-flow techniques. These data provide the first biophysical evidence that S1S2-agonist binding is a two-step process, in which docking is followed by isomerization. This isomerization represents the conversion of the free energy of agonist binding into mechanical changes by S1S2 alone,i.e. in the absence of load. Comparison with the (possibly distinct) S1S2 conformational changes that occur in the context of the intact receptor should ultimately provide insight into the mechanism by which agonist binding drives channel activation and desensitization. By analyzing the agonist binding kinetics of a panel of site-directed mutants, we have identified key side chains in the docking and locking steps. Our data also complement the recent finding that the phosphate-binding protein engages in rapid docking and subsequent slow cleft closure (35.Ledvina P.S. Tsai A.-L. Wang Z. Koehl E. Quiocho F.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2550-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the earlier proposal of rapid isomerization for the arabinose-binding protein (36.Vermersch P.S. Tesmer J.J.G. Lemon D.D. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16592-16603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that S1S2 and the PBP have similar kinetic profiles. S1S2 from GluRD was prepared as described (17.Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with modifications (37.Abele R. Lampinen M. Keinänen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25132-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The panel of site-directed mutants has also been described (38.Lampinen M. Pentikäinen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1998; 17 (and references therein): 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All fluorescence spectra and titrations were measured with an SLM-AMINCO 8000 spectrofluorometer. The excitation band pass was 4 nm; the emission band pass was 8 nm; and the sample cell was maintained at 5 °C with a circulating water bath. All measurements were determined as the ratio between the fluorescence change of the sample and a reference cuvette filled with rhodamine to reduce the noise due to intensity fluctuations of the xenon lamp. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm for all measurements, and the fluorescence change of the titration measurements was followed at 336 nm. For the titration experiments, aliquots of 10 μl of concentrated ligand were added to a quartz cuvette containing 3 ml of protein (0.03–0.50 μm) in 10 mmNaPi (pH 7.3) and mixed continuously with a magnetic stirrer. For the titration measurements with AMPA, 100 mmKSCN, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 30 mm Tris (pH 7.2) was used for comparability with published measurements. Data points were collected every 3 s. For each ligand concentration, 20–25 data points were averaged. The fluorescence change was corrected for the dilution of the sample with ligand. The results were fitted by Equation 1, Fi=F0+ΔFmax×(P0+L0+Kd)−(P0+L0+Kd) 2−4×P0×L02×P0Equation 1 where F i is the fluorescence observed after the ith addition of ligand, F 0 is the fluorescence of the free protein, P0 is the total protein concentration, and L0 is the total ligand concentration. Free parameters were the dissociation constant K dand the maximum fluorescence change in going from unbound to completely bound protein (ΔF max). Due to kainate absorbance at 280 nm at high concentrations, Equation 1 was modified to include an additional component linear in ligand concentration (L0) for mutants E403Q and E706D, which had a very low affinity for kainate. Hill coefficients calculated for the binding reactions were between 0.9 and 1.1 (±0.05) for glutamate and kainate and slightly higher (1.0–1.5) for AMPA. Rapid kinetic measurements were performed in an SF-61 stopped-flow fluorometer (Hi-Tech Scientific). The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the fluorescence decrease was detected with a photomultiplier with a WG-320 filter (nominal cutoff of 320 nm). The dead time of the device was 1.0–1.5 ms. For glutamate and kainate, the kinetic measurements were performed in 10 mmNaPi (pH 7.3), and for AMPA, in 100 mm KSCN, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 30 mm Tris (pH 7.2), again for purposes of comparability with published data. Control experiments were also performed with AMPA in which 100 mmKCl replaced 100 mm KSCN. All measurements were carried out at 5 °C with a protein concentration between 0.05 and 5 μm. Pseudo first-order reaction conditions were employed (ligand concentration >5-fold higher than protein concentration). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, five to seven individual traces for each ligand concentration were averaged. The measurements were repeated two to three times. The reactions were monophasic for glutamate and kainate binding to all S1S2 variants; these time courses were fitted with a single exponential curve. For AMPA binding, a biphasic reaction was observed, of which one phase (k obs ≅ 0.6–1.2 s−1) was independent of added ligand and was thus apparently a mixing artifact caused by the presence of the chaotrope KSCN (monophasic reactions were observed when KCl replaced KSCN in the binding buffer). For AMPA concentrations above 10 μm, the contribution of the second phase could be ignored due to the rapid time course of the reactions, and the data were fitted with a single exponential curve. For lower concentrations, a biexponential fit was performed, but only the ligand-dependent time constant was considered. Standard kinetic analysis was performed as described (39.Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979: 187-286Google Scholar). For agonist/protein combinations showing a linear dependence ofk obs on ligand concentration under pseudo first-order conditions, a one-step mechanism was assumed (see Equation4 below). A least-squares linear fit was performed according to Equation 2, kobs=koff+kon×L̄Equation 2 where L̄ is the concentration of free ligand. For agonist/protein combinations showing a nonlinear dependence ofk obs on ligand concentration under pseudo first-order conditions, a two-step binding mechanism was assumed (see Equation 5 below) in which association is rapid compared with isomerization (see Equation 6 below). A nonlinear least-squares fit was performed according to Equation 3. kobs=k−2+k+2×L̄(Kd1+L̄)Equation 3 The interactions of glutamate with the S1S2 binding site (see Fig. 4 B) were modeled by assuming that the glutamate atoms would adopt the same positions as corresponding atoms in kainate (e.g. glutamate α-amino = kainate pyrrolidine nitrogen; α-carboxylate = 2-carboxylate; δ-carboxylate = 3-methyl carboxylate). Ligand interactions were plotted using the program LIGPLOT (40.Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar). Modeling of S1S2 side chain mutations was performed in O (41.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) using standard side chain rotamers (42.Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence of S1S2 changed upon agonist binding (Fig.1). Two facts suggest that Trp is the primary internal fluorophore, both for the intrinsic fluorescence and for the agonist-induced fluorescence change. The observed excitation maximum lies between 282 and 283 nm for the apo and holo forms of S1S2 and for the difference spectrum (emission monitored at 336 nm). Furthermore, using excitation wavelengths of 280 and 296 nm, similar emission spectra were obtained, although 296 nm excitation produced a weaker signal (at 336 nm, emission was ∼16% of that seen at 280 nm; excitation at 290 nm yielded ∼50%). None of the four S1S2 tryptophans is located in the immediate vicinity of the binding site (21.Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.-Q. Gouaux J.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), so this signal most likely reflects an isomerization process. Together with the nonlinear kinetic results presented below, this represents the first direct evidence that the S1S2 domain by itself undergoes a conformational change following ligand binding. Kainate produces apparently non-desensitizing whole-cell currents at AMPA receptors due to its rapid desensitization kinetics (32.Patneau D.K. Vyklicky Jr., L. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has thus been proposed that the kainate-bound x-ray structure reflects a non-desensitized, activated state intermediate between the resting and desensitized states (21.Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.-Q. Gouaux J.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that the maximum fluorescence change (ΔF max, Equation 1) observed in the presence of saturating concentrations of agonist was smaller for kainate (−10.8 ± 3.8%) than for glutamate (−19.0 ± 1.2%) or AMPA (−17.0 ± 1.3%). Although we cannot assign the conformational changes in S1S2 to functional states of the intact receptor, it is possible that the more rapid and partial desensitization induced by kainate reflects smaller induced conformational changes in the domain. Since we do not know which tryptophan residue(s) contribute to the signal, it is not possible to interpret the fluorescence change directly in structural terms. However, the fluorescence change permitted us to measure the kinetics of protein-ligand association following rapid mixing. In addition, comparison of the kinetics of wild-type S1S2 and site-directed mutants enabled us to assess structural changes associated with the initial steps of ligand binding. The kinetic behavior of protein-agonist binding was monophasic, rapid, and concentration-dependent over a wide range of agonist concentrations (Fig. 2). Under pseudo first-order conditions, the apparent rate constants (k obs) for AMPA and glutamate showed a linear dependence on ligand concentration (Fig. 2 D), yielding estimates (Table I) for overall association (k on) and dissociation (k off) rate constants analogous to values determined for a number of PBP for a one-step binding mechanism (36.Vermersch P.S.

Open table in a new tab The rate constants thus obtained for glutamate are similar to those of PBP specific for various amino acids and sugars, with a rapid, but not necessarily diffusion-limited, k on on the order of 107 to 108m−1 s−1(here, 1.6 × 107m−1 s−1) and a slow k off on the order of 1–10 s−1 (here, 7.6 s−1). This slow glutamate dissociation rate constant also agrees broadly with values obtained by modeling electrophysiological data: rate constants for quisqualate and domoate dissociation from AMPA receptors have been estimated at 30–37 s−1 (45.Clements J.D. Feltz A. Sahara Y. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and those for glycine dissociation from N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors at 0.3–1.3 s−1 (46.Lester R.A.J. Tong G. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constant for AMPA is significantly slower than that for glutamate: 0.06 s−1. This is also consistent with an estimate of 0.032 s−1 for AMPA dissociation from rat brain membranes (47.Arai A. Silberg J. Kessler M. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 1995; 66: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When KSCN was replaced by KCl in the AMPA binding buffer, a linear concentration dependence ofk obs was also observed; consistent with observations on intact receptors, the main effect of KSCN is to stabilize the ligand-bound form, i.e. to reducek off (34.Abele R.

Unfortunately, a more detailed comparison of the kinetics of S1S2- and GluR-ligand binding is precluded by the paucity of experimental results on the intact molecule. This is due to limitations in the speed of agonist application in electrophysiological experiments and to difficulties expressing and purifying sufficient quantities of GluR for biochemical measurements. Flash photolysis techniques (48.Jayaraman V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16735-16740Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the large-scale expression of recombinant intact GluR 2M. Safferling, K. Keinänen, and D. R. Madden, unpublished data. may permit more detailed comparison in the future. Unlike the AMPA and glutamate values, the pseudo first-order rate constants for kainate show a hyperbolic dependence on ligand concentration (Fig. 2 D). This is not consistent with a one-step binding mechanism, nor is it consistent with a Venus flytrap mechanism in which the cleft closure step is faster than the initial binding step, as has been proposed for the arabinose-binding protein (36.Vermersch P.S. Tesmer J.J.G. Lemon D.D. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16592-16603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would, however, be consistent with a two-step dock/lock mechanism (Equation 5), P+L ⇌k−1k+1 PL ⇌k−2k+2 P*LEquation 5 in which P is S1S2 in its unbound conformation, P* is S1S2 following isomerization, and the transition from P to P* produces the fluorescence signal, provided that binding is more rapid than isomerization, i.e. (Equation 6), k+1(P̄+L̄)+k−1≫k+2+k−2Equation 6 where P̄ and L̄ are the equilibrium concentrations of free S1S2 and agonist, respectively (39.Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979: 187-286Google Scholar). In this case, we can estimate the equilibrium dissociation constant for docking (K d1) and the forward and backward isomerization rate constants (k +2 andk −2) for the reaction with kainate (Table I). Such slow isomerization was recently demonstrated for the phosphate-binding protein (35.Ledvina P.S. Tsai A.-L. Wang Z. Koehl E. Quiocho F.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2550-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The hyperbolic concentration dependence of k obs for S1S2 also supports the observation that the reporter Trp residue(s) must be distant from the binding site and therefore sensitive to the isomerization, rather than the docking, step. Consistent with slow isomerization in S1S2, kinetic measurements on hippocampal neurons using caged kainate reveal that channel opening occurs more slowly than agonist binding (48.Jayaraman V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16735-16740Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These measurements also yielded forward and backward rate constants of activation for intact AMPA receptors of 5000 and 640 s−1, respectively, faster than the values detected here for"

Common molecular consequences of presenilin FAD mutations include the increased production of amyloid β-peptide x-42 and increased apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 9.Hardy J.

Additionally, many of these presenilin-interacting proteins have been identified and characterized using overexpression in cell systems, whereas only a few have been demonstrated to interact with PS1 and/or PS2 endogenously (e.g. β-catenin). Although the N-terminal and loop domains are not conserved between the presenilins, FAD mutations have been identified within these regions in both proteins (1.Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Kim T.-W.

Sorcin is a penta-EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein that modulates the ryanodine receptor (RyR) intracellular calcium channel (39.Meyers M.B. Pickel V.M. Sheu S.-S. Sharma V.K. Scotto K.W. Fishman G.I. J.

We have found that sorcin interacts with the stable C-terminal endoproteolytic fragment of PS2 but not with the immature full-length form. This interaction between sorcin and a subset of the functional PS2 complexes was modulated by Ca2+ and occurred in a novel subcellular fraction. Our results reveal a molecular link between PS2 and intracellular Ca2+ channels, suggesting that sorcin is involved in the role of PS2 in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding sorcin (40.Van der Bliek A.M. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Hes E. Borst P.

Isolated full-length cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), and the inserts were sequenced using a double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Inducible expression constructs (pUHD10–3) coding for wild-type and N141I mutant versions of PS2 were previously described (32.Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Hallmark O.G. Moir R.D. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. J.

For the constitutive expression of PS2, the inserts from the inducible expression constructs (without FLAG epitope tags) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) and were fully verified by sequencing. Stable PS2 cell lines were generated by transfecting SH-SY5Y cells in a 100-mm dish with 5 μg of each plasmid: wild-type PS2, N141I PS2, or vector alone (pcDNA3.1/Zeo+). Individual zeocin-resistant colonies were isolated and screened for PS2 expression by Western blotting using αPS2Loop (30.Thinakaran G. Borcehlt D. Lee M. Slunt H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T.

To quantitate relative amounts of presenilin and sorcin in the blots, Fluor-S MultiImager and MultiAnalyst software (Bio-Rad) were utilized. Cells or tissues were lysed using IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitors, and solubilized proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 0.25–0.5% Nonidet P-40 was utilized, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin was included. The samples were pre-cleared with protein A conjugated with magnetic beads (PerSeptive Diagnostics) for 1 h at 4 °C, incubated with antibodies overnight, further incubated with protein A-magnetic beads (30 μl/sample) for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with IP buffer. Immunoprecipitates were collected using a magnetic bead collector, heated to 60 °C in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Antibodies used include GM130 (Transduction Laboratories), calnexin (Stressgene), transferrin receptor (a gift of Dr. I. Trowbridge), APS26 (15.Tesco G. Kim T.-W. Diehlmann A. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33909-33914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (a gift of Anke Diehlmann and Konrad Beyreuther), and calcineurin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells grown on glass coverslips or chamber slides were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), double-stained with monoclonal anti-sorcin antibody and αPS2loop, and then incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) and Bodipy-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent images were captured and analyzed using a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope mounted on a Nikon inverted microscope. Subcellular fractionation of cultured cells was performed using a protocol that has been previously described with minor modifications (48.Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 49.Kim M. Velier J. Chase K. Laforet G. Kalchman M.A. Hayden M.R. Won L. Heller A. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice each with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenization buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and homogenized using a 25-gauge needle and a tight-pestle metal Dounce homogenizer. A post-nuclear supernatant resulting from low speed centrifugation was separated by differential centrifugation at 1,000 × g, 14,000 ×g, and 100,000 × g to yield post-nuclear supernatant, P2, and P3, respectively. Pooled membrane fractions were further separated by density gradient centrifugation using step gradients consisting of 24, 19.33, 14.66, and 10% isotonic Nycodenz solutions (made in 0.75% NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and were fractionated using a density gradient fractionator. The fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to PS2, sorcin, and other marker proteins. To search for putative interacting proteins for the PS2 loop region, we performed a domain-specific homology search of GenBankTM. The protein synexin was found to have a high degree of homology between its N terminus and a portion of the large hydrophilic loop region of PS2 (Fig.1 A). Synexin, also known as annexin VII, is a member of the annexin family of calcium- and phospholipid-binding proteins (50.Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). We then asked whether the protein sorcin, which has previously been shown to interact with the N-terminal region of synexin (47.Brownawell A.M. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22182-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), might also interact with the PS2 loop. Sorcin is a member of the family of Ca2+-binding proteins harboring five EF-hand motifs (40.Van der Bliek A.M. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Hes E. Borst P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 41.Maki M. Narayama S.V.L. Hitomi K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 718-720PubMed Google Scholar). We first isolated full-length sorcin cDNA from an adult human brain library and subcloned it into an expression plasmid encoding the Myc epitope tag; Myc-tagged sorcin (Myc-sorcin) was then stably transfected into human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibody revealed Myc-sorcin with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa, and anti-sorcin antibodies detected a ∼29-kDa transgene-derived epitope-tagged form of sorcin as well as the 26-kDa endogenous sorcin (Fig. 1 B). We next performed complementary co-immunoprecipitation analyses of PS2 and Myc-sorcin using αPS2Loop antibody (30.Thinakaran G. Borcehlt D. Lee M. Slunt H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.L. Gandy S.E. Jenkinds N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D., L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) in lysates prepared from COS cells transfected with either Myc-sorcin or a Myc-tagged control protein, Myc-grancalcin, or Myc-XIAP (Fig. 1 C). Only Myc-sorcin was co-immunoprecipitated by αPS2Loop, indicating that Myc-sorcin interacts with endogenous PS2 C-terminal (loop) fragments (PS2-CTF) (Fig. 1 C). Sorcin was detectable in human temporal cortex by combined immunoprecipitation-Western blotting analyses using two separate antibodies raised against human sorcin (Fig. 1 D). Sorcin in the human temporal cortex (∼28 kDa) exhibited a slightly larger apparent molecular mass than sorcin in SH-SY5Y cells (∼26 kDa), possibly due to alternative splicing; a molecular mass of ∼26–28 kDa is also slightly larger than the previously reported ∼22 kDa (39.Meyers M.B.

Biedler J.L. Hes E. Borst P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether this endogenous sorcin associates with endogenous PS2 in vivo, detergent lysates were prepared from human temporal cortex and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using αPS2Loop antibody or with αPS1Loop (30.Thinakaran G. Borcehlt D. Lee M. Slunt H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.L. Gandy S.E. Jenkinds N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D., L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) as a negative control (Fig.1 E). Endogenous sorcin was recovered from these samples using only αPS2Loop (Fig. 1 E), indicating that sorcin associates with PS2 but not with PS1 in the brain. To explore the cellular function of the PS2/sorcin interaction, we next attempted to determine the subcellular locus wherein the PS2/sorcin interaction occurs. For this purpose, we first visualized sorcin and PS2-CTF in stable PS2-expressing SH-SY5Y cell lines using double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig.2 A). PS2 immunoreactivity was mainly detected in smooth ER/Golgi-like intracellular membrane compartments, whereas sorcin immunoreactivity was more disperse (Fig.2 A). Sorcin and PS2-CTF co-localized only to a restricted subcellular region (Fig. 2 A, yellow indicates overlapping signals). Since sorcin is a cytosolic protein (51.Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and PS2 is a known integral membrane protein (52.Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Podlisny M. Selkoe D.J. Seeger M. Gandy S.E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 7: 1023-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we predicted that a subset of cytosolic sorcin might associate with membranous subcellular structures to allow the interaction of sorcin with PS2. To locate the PS2-sorcin interaction, we performed subcellular fractionation using stable PS2 SH-SY5Y cell lines. After an initial homogenization and differential centrifugation, sorcin was predominantly found in the cytosolic fraction, although sorcin immunoreactivity was also detectable in the heavy membrane fraction, P2 (Fig. 2 B). As predicted, PS2-CTF was absent in the cytosolic fraction and was highly enriched in the P2 fraction, where membrane-associated sorcin was detected (Fig. 2 B). To define the specific subcellular membrane compartment where the PS2/sorcin interaction occurs, total membrane fractions prepared from SH-SY5Y stably cells expressing wild-type PS2 were further separated using Nycodenz discontinuous density gradient centrifugation (48.Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 49.Kim M. Velier J. Chase K. Laforet G. Kalchman M.A. Hayden M.R. Won L. Heller A. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to PS2 and sorcin (Fig. 2 C). The full-length PS2 polypeptide exhibited virtually identical subcellular distribution to that of calnexin, a rough ER marker (arrow a, Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the PS2-CTF was visualized in three major peaks: peak one (fractions 3 and 4), peak two (fractions 6–8), and peak three (fractions 11 and 12) (Fig. 2 C). Sorcin and PS2 were co-localized only to peak one membrane fractions, indicating that the PS2-sorcin complex was localized specifically to this subcellular compartment (arrow b, Fig. 2 C). In addition, we performed Western blot analyses using antibodies to multiple subcellular marker proteins. Interestingly, 19-kDa calcineurin B, a Ca2+-binding subunit of calcineurin, was distinctively co-distributed with sorcin in the Nycodenz gradient fractions (Fig.2 C). Membrane-associated sorcin did not appear to co-localize with the majority of other subcellular markers tested, including α-adaptin, γ-adaptin, clathrin light chain, BAG-1, and Bcl-2 (data not shown). Neither the Golgi matrix protein GM130 nor the transferrin receptor co-distributed with sorcin or PS2 (Fig.2 C). These data demonstrate that membrane-associated sorcin and a subset of PS2 endoproteolytic fragments, but not full-length PS2, co-localize together to a subcellular compartment that is positive for calcineurin B. Our data also indicate that the C-terminal endoproteolytic fragment and full-length forms of PS2 localize to different subcellular compartments in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig.2 C). To determine further the PS2 species that predominantly interacts with sorcin, we co-immunoprecipitated PS2 using anti-sorcin antibodies (Fig.3 A). The levels of PS2-CTF that co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous sorcin were proportional to the levels of PS2-CTF detected in total cell lysates (data not shown). Virtually no full-length PS2 was recovered in the sorcin immunoprecipitates, confirming that sorcin preferentially interacts with PS2-CTF (Fig. 3 A). We next tested whether increased accumulation of full-length PS2 affects the interaction between sorcin and PS2. Both treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or ALLN (Fig. 3 B) and overexpression of PS2 by transient transfection (data not shown) have previously been shown to lead to increased levels of full-length PS2 and ubiquitin-positive high molecular weight forms of PS2 but not PS2 endoproteolytic fragments (32.Kim T.-W.

Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). No increase was observed in the interaction between PS2 and sorcin under either condition. Along with the subcellular fractionation data, our studies reveal that sorcin interacts with a subset of the PS2 complexes consisting of the endoproteolytic fragments but does not interact with full-length PS2. We next examined whether increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration modulates the sorcin/PS2 interaction. Treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 did not alter the steady-state levels of sorcin or PS2 (Fig. 4 A). Meanwhile, the level of sorcin that co-immunoprecipitated with αPS2Loop greatly increased as the result of A23187 treatment (Fig.4 A). To explore the possibility that Ca2+mediates the translocation of the sorcin-PS2 complex, we examined the subcellular distribution of membrane-associated sorcin in PS2-expressing cells that were grown in the presence or absence of A23187. Although A23187 did not alter the subcellular distribution of the sorcin-PS2 complex, we found that A23187 treatment led to increased association of sorcin with the membrane (Fig. 4 B). Our studies demonstrate that sorcin is translocated from the cytosol to the membrane when cytosolic Ca2+ is elevated by this ionophore, indicating that the recruitment of sorcin into a molecular complex harboring PS2 is modulated by intracellular Ca2+levels. We report that presenilin 2 interacts endogenously with sorcin, a modulator of the RyR intracellular Ca2+-releasing channel. Regulation of ryanodine receptor activity by accessory molecules has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and other neuronal activities (43.Valdivia H.H. Trends Pharmacol.

We have also shown that membrane-bound forms of sorcin co-fractionate with a subset of PS2 endoproteolytic fragments to a subcellular compartment harboring calcineurin B (Fig. 2 C), another Ca2+-binding molecule that appears to be involved in the regulation of both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- and ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ channels (57.Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In addition, the PS2-sorcin interaction and the translocation of sorcin to the membrane appear to be increased by elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 4). These data reveal a molecular link between PS2 and cellular Ca2+ channels and raise the possibility that sorcin is recruited by PS2 into a molecular complex involved in intracellular Ca2+ modulation. In the future, it will be important to characterize the membranous organelles harboring the PS2-sorcin complex and to determine whether the PS2-sorcin complex includes an intracellular Ca2+ channel (e.g. RyR) as a primary component. Although other Ca2+-binding proteins have been shown to interact with PS2, such as calsenilin and calmyrin (26.Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.-K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat.

Accordingly, the PS2 species that were found to interact detectably with calsenilin and calmyrin were full-length PS2 but not PS2 endoproteolytic fragments (26.Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.-K. Luo Y.

Because growing evidence indicates that the endoproteolytic fragments comprise the functional units of the presenilins (11.Thinakaran G. J. Clin.

In contrast, our data show that sorcin interacts with a subset of PS2 endoproteolytic fragments but not with full-length PS2, further supporting the possibility that the sorcin-PS2 interaction has a functional role (i.e. in Ca2+ modulation). Implications of the sorcin-PS2 interaction for FAD remain to be elucidated. Since the large hydrophilic loop regions are divergent between PS1 and PS2 and no FAD mutation has been identified in the putative sorcin binding region of PS2 (synexin homologous domain), the exact contributions of sorcin and other PS1/PS2 loop-interacting molecules to AD neuropathogenesis have not been fully elucidated (16.Zhang Z.

GSK3 protein was clearly present in adipocytes and was found to be more abundant than in muscle and liver cell lines. The selective GSK3 inhibitor, LiCl, stimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthase activity (20 and 65%, respectively, of the maximal (1 μm) insulin response) and potentiated the responses to a submaximal concentration (1 nm) of insulin. LiCl- and insulin-stimulated glucose transport were abolished by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor, wortmannin; however, LiCl stimulation of glycogen synthase was not. In contrast to the rapid stimulation of glucose transport by insulin, transport stimulated by LiCl increased gradually over 3–5 h reaching 40% of the maximal insulin-stimulated level. Both LiCl- and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity were maximal at 25 min. However, insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity returned to basal after 2 h, coincident with reactivation of GSK3. After a 2-h exposure to insulin, glycogen synthase was refractory to restimulation with insulin, indicating selective desensitization of this pathway. However, LiCl could partially stimulate glycogen synthase in desensitized cells. Furthermore, coincubation with LiCl during the 2 h exposure to insulin completely blocked desensitization of glycogen synthase activity. In summary, inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl: 1) stimulated glycogen synthase activity directly and independently of PI3-kinase, 2) stimulated glucose transport at a point upstream of PI3-kinase, 3) stimulated glycogen synthase activity in desensitized cells, and 4) prevented desensitization of glycogen synthase due to chronic insulin treatment. These data are consistent with GSK3 playing a central role in the regulation of glycogen synthase activity and a contributing factor in the regulation of glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

One target of PKB is the Ser/Thr kinase, glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (2.van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M.Th. J. Biol.

Two isoforms of GSK3, α and β, are broadly expressed and play multiple regulatory roles in development and metabolism (4.Plyte S. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). GSK3 is constitutively active in cells and is transiently inhibited following insulin treatment (3.Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Inactivation of GSK3 by insulin requires PI3-kinase and appears to be mediated by PKB phosphorylation of GSK3 on Ser-21 (α) or Ser-9 (β) (3.Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). GSK3 plays an important role in the regulation of glycogen synthesis via inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. Indeed, overexpression of GSK3β leads to inhibition of basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity (6.Eldar-Finkelman H. Argast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis is impaired in muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes (8.Shulman G.I. Rothman D.L. Jue T. Stein P. DeFronzo R.A. Shulman R.G. N. Engl. J.

Although the mechanism of this impairment is not completely understood, altered kinetic behavior of glycogen synthase persists in cultured skeletal muscle cells from diabetic patients even after prolonged maintenance under normoglycemic and normoinsulinemic conditions (9.Henry R.R. Ciaraldi T.P. Abrams-Carter L. Mudaliar S. Park K.S. Nikoulina S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1231-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The observed changes in the kinetic behavior of glycogen synthase could be secondary to increased phosphorylation (9.Henry R.R. Ciaraldi T.P. Abrams-Carter L. Mudaliar S. Park K.S. Nikoulina S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1231-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and consistent with this, the level of GSK3 protein has been shown to be elevated in skeletal muscle of Type 2 diabetics (10.Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Mudaliar S. Mohadeen P. Carter L. Henry R.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests another potential role for GSK3 as a negative regulator of insulin signaling through phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (11.Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser/Thr residues by GSK3 makes it a poorer substrate for the insulin receptor kinase, leading to decreased phosphorylation on tyrosine in response to insulin stimulation (11.Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been proposed as the mechanism whereby several agents, tumor necrosis factor α (12.Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13.Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), or the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (15.Tanti J.-F. Grémeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), impair signaling through PI3-kinase and blunt insulin stimulation of metabolic responses. Thus, in addition to direct modulation of glycogen synthase, GSK3 may be one of several kinases that negatively modulate insulin signal transduction via phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates. A role for GSK3 as a negative regulator of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was proposed based on overexpression studies (11.Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It has not been established whether such a negative feedback loop exists in cells expressing physiological levels of GSK3. Therefore, the role of GSK3 in two insulin-regulated biological responses, glycogen synthase activation and glucose transport, has been examined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using a GSK3 inhibitor, lithium ion (Li+) (16.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar,17.Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Li+ inhibits GSK3 in vitro with an IC50 of 2 mm but does not inhibit several other kinases such as protein kinase A, casein kinase II, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1, stress-activated protein kinase, Raf, or Trk (16.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar, 17.Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo studies in several organisms suggest that GSK3 is an important physiological target of Li+ action. For example, Li+treatment of Xenopus embryos leads to a dorsalized phenotype similar to that observed in response to expression of a dominant negative mutant of GSK3 (16.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). In contrast, inositol monophosphatase inhibition, another action of Li+, fails to phenocopy the Li+ effect on development (16.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Li+ can be insulin mimetic, stimulating glycogen synthesis in adipocytes, muscle cells, and hepatocytes (7.Summers S.A. Kao A.W.

Stimulation of glucose transport in adipocytes is not because of inositol monophosphatase inhibition (23.Chen X. McMahon E.G. Gulve E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E272-E277PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this functional effect of Li+ could also result from the inhibition of GSK3. Li+ treatment can normalize insulin sensitivity in diabetic rats (24.Rossetti L. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and has been shown to increase glucose tolerance in humans (25.van der Velde C.D. Gordon M.W. Arch. Gen.

Psychiatry. 1970; 23: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The goal of the present work was to determine whether inhibition of GSK3 with Li+ exerts a positive influence on insulin signaling or alters insulin-induced desensitization of the signaling pathway in adipocytes. 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown to confluence in 12-well tissue culture plates. Two days post-confluence, cell differentiation was initiated by incubation with 2 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-methyl-xanthine in standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic) for 48 h. Medium was removed and replaced with standard medium containing 2 μg/ml insulin. After 2 more days, cells were refed with standard medium. At a minimum of nine days post differentiation, adipocytes were washed twice with serum-free (SF) DMEM. Cells were then preincubated with SF-DMEM for 2.5 h followed by aspiration of the medium and the addition of 1 ml of SF-DMEM containing either insulin, lithium, or insulin plus lithium at the indicated concentrations. At the indicated times, this medium was aspirated, and 1 ml of uptake buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 mm 2-deoxyglucose (0.01 uCi/ml [U-14C]-2-deoxyglucose) was added/well. After 10 min at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. Uptake was quantitated by liquid scintillation. Adipocytes were washed and incubated in SF-DMEM as described above. SF-DMEM contained 0.25% bovine serum albumin, except in studies using wortmannin because this inhibitor was inactive in the presence of bovine serum albumin. Adipocytes were treated with insulin, lithium, or insulin plus lithium as described in the figures and then scraped into 600 μl of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KF, 15 mm EDTA, 0.6 m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by a hand-held polytron (10 s, Kinematica AG), and 10 μl of each lysate was assayed for glycogen synthase activity using the “high glucose 6-phosphate (G6P)/low G6P” method (28.Guinovart J.J. Salavert A. Massagué J. Ciudad C.J. Salsas E. Itarte E. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 90 μl. Each sample was assayed in the presence of 10 mm G6P (the “high G6P” assay) to determine total glycogen synthase activity or 0.25 mm G6P (the “low G6P” assay) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 25 mm KF, 12.5 mmEDTA, 7 mg/ml glycogen, and 200 μmUDP-[U-14C]glucose (4.5 μCi/umol). Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 10 min and stopped by placing on ice and spotting 75 μl of reaction mixture onto Whatman 31 ET Chroma filter paper. Glycogen was precipitated by washing filters in 50% ethanol for 5 min, followed by two more 1-h washes in 50% ethanol, and a 5-min wash in acetone. Filters were dried, and 14C-glucose incorporation into glycogen was quantitated by liquid scintillation. Data were expressed as the ratio of glycogen synthase activity under conditions of “low” and “high” glucose 6-phosphate. Adipocytes were serum-deprived for 2.5 h in SF-DMEM containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Cells were treated as indicated in the same medium and scraped into 400 μl of GSK3 homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm KF, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μmmicrocystin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1× Calbiochem Protease Inhibitor Mixture). Cells were homogenized with a 10-s burst at top speed with a hand-held polytron. Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × gat 4 °C. Supernatants were saved for GSK3 assay, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with bovine γ-globulin as standards. For the assay, 12.5 μl of extract (corresponding to ∼10 μg of protein) was mixed with 6.25 μl of 4× substrate and 6.25 μl of 4× ATP mixture. The substrate, B-2B-(SP), is a biotinylated peptide corresponding to the single phosphorylation site of translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). This peptide (2B-SP, RRAAEELDSRAGpSPQL-OH) was reported to be selective for GSK3 and therefore useful for measuring GSK3 activity in cell extracts likely to contain other Ser/Thr kinases (29.Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nonspecific kinase activity was determined in duplicate assays containing 200 mm LiCl, which completely inhibits GSK3 activity in vitro, and was subtracted from incorporation in the absence of lithium. The concentration of biotinylated peptide in the assay was 0.6 mg/ml (326 μm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 4× ATP mixture to yield final concentrations of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [ γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) resulting in a specific activity of ∼880 cpm/pmol. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 1 N HCl. Peptide was captured by applying 10 μl of the terminated reaction mixture to SAM2 Biotin Capture Membranes (Promega, Madison, WI). Membranes were washed according to the manufacturer's instructions: once for 30 s in 2 mNaCl, three times for 2 min each in 2 m NaCl, four times for 2 min each in 2 m NaCl, 15 mm phosphoric acid, and twice for 30 s each in deionized water. Membranes were rinsed in 100% ethanol for 1 min and dried at 60 °C, and peptide phosphorylation was quantitated by scintillation counting. The resulting cpm were converted into milliunits (mU) of GSK3 activity in which 1 mU of GSK3 corresponds to 1 pmol/min of 32P incorporation. GSK3β was easily detectable by immunoblotting in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). The level of GSK3β in adipocytes was higher than that found in Fao hepatoma cells or L6 myocytes but lower than that found in the TE671 medulloblastoma cell line (data not shown). GSK3 activity was detectable in as little as 500 ng of 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lysate and increased linearly with increasing protein over a 10-fold range (data not shown). Therefore, we examined the effect of the GSK3 inhibitor, LiCl, on glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.1 A). LiCl dose dependently stimulated glucose transport with a statistically significant increase being observed at 20 mm and above (Fig. 1 A). 50 mm LiCl increased transport 2–3-fold over basal (mean, 2.8-fold; n = 13 experiments; p < 0.0001 versus basal), which corresponds to ∼19% of the response elicited by a maximal dose (1 μm) of insulin (Fig. 1 B). NaCl does not inhibit GSK3 (16.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar) and at concentrations up to 50 mm did not stimulate transport (Fig. 1 A), suggesting the action of 50 mm LiCl was not because of nonspecific salt effects. However, higher salt concentrations (100 mm, Fig. 1 A) appeared to act nonspecifically because both LiCl and NaCl stimulated uptake. The relatively small stimulation of transport in response to LiCl alone contrasts with the potentiation observed when LiCl was combined with a submaximal dose (1 nm) of insulin (Fig. 1 B). LiCl at 1 mm, a concentration which did not stimulate transport by itself (Fig. 1 A), elicited a small but significant increase in transport induced by 1 nm insulin (11%, p = 0.015, Fig. 1 B). Higher LiCl concentrations were synergistic with 1 nm insulin, increasing transport 2–3-fold over that stimulated by 1 nminsulin alone (Fig. 1 B). Glucose transport induced by the combination of 1 nm insulin and 50 mm LiCl was 60% of that induced by a maximal insulin concentration rather than the 20% observed in response to 1 nm insulin alone. As previously reported (30.Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glucose transport in response to insulin is inhibited by the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm,Fig. 2). Transport stimulated by LiCl, whether in the presence or absence of 1 nm insulin, was also blocked by wortmannin (Fig. 2), indicating that both agents require PI3-kinase for stimulation of glucose transport in adipocytes.Figure 2Inhibition of insulin and lithium-stimulated glucose uptake by wortmannin. Adipocytes were treated for 25 min with insulin or lithium as indicated, in the absence (open columns) or presence (filled columns) of 100 nm wortmannin. Uptake was measured for 10 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each column represents the mean of triplicate assays ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was activated in response to LiCl (Fig. 3). Activation of glycogen synthase by 50 mm LiCl ranged from 43 to 103% of that in response to 100 nm insulin (mean, 61.4 ± 8.2%;n = 7 experiments), and the combination of LiCl and 1 nm insulin gave a supramaximal response (Fig.3 A). NaCl (50 mm) did not stimulate glycogen synthase nor did it potentiate insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to the results with glucose transport, LiCl-stimulated glycogen synthase activation was largely resistant to wortmannin inhibition, whereas that stimulated by insulin was not (Fig. 3 B). Thus, LiCl appears to be acting downstream of PI3-kinase to stimulate glycogen synthase. Further distinctions between LiCl and insulin stimulation of glucose transport or glycogen synthase emerged from time course studies. Glucose transport was maximally elevated after 30 min of treatment with 1 μm insulin and remained elevated during 8 h of insulin exposure (Fig. 4). In contrast, treatment of adipocytes for 30 min with 50 mm LiCl induced a 2–3-fold elevation in glucose transport, which increased to ∼5-fold over basal after 5 h of incubation (Fig. 4). Therefore, LiCl-stimulated glucose transport continued to increase over a more prolonged time course than that stimulated by insulin, and maximum transport in response to 50 mm LiCl was only 33% of that in response to insulin. However, glucose transport in response to both agents remained elevated for the duration of an 8-h exposure (Fig.4). Glycogen synthase, in contrast, was maximally activated in response to either insulin (1 μm) or LiCl (50 mm) after 30 min of treatment (Fig. 5). LiCl stimulated glycogen synthase activity at 30 min was 36% of that stimulated by insulin in this experiment (Fig. 5). Glycogen synthase activity remained elevated in LiCl-treated cells during the 8 h of exposure (Fig. 5). However, glycogen synthase activation in insulin-treated adipocytes was transient, declining to basal levels by 2 h and continuing to decline to below basal levels during 8 h of insulin exposure (Fig. 5). This transient activation of glycogen synthase by insulin is distinct from the persistent activation of glucose transport and suggests that the pathway to glycogen synthase is selectively desensitized. This contrasts with the persistent stimulation of glycogen synthase observed in response to LiCl (Fig.5). Because GSK3 phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase and is transiently inactivated in response to insulin (2.van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M.Th. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 31.Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether the reactivation of GSK3 following insulin treatment exhibited a temporal correlation with the observed inhibition of glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 cells. Maximal inhibition of GSK3 activity in insulin-treated adipocytes was 48% and was observed at 25 min, coincident with the maximal activation of glycogen synthase (Fig. 6). Reactivation of GSK3 occurred over the same time course as inhibition of glycogen synthase (Fig. 6), indicating that glycogen synthase and GSK3 are reciprocally regulated in response to insulin stimulation in adipocytes. To determine if the transient stimulation of glycogen synthase activity by insulin was because of a true desensitization of this pathway, adipocytes were incubated with or without insulin (1 μm) for 2 h and then restimulated with insulin prior to measurement of glycogen synthase activity. Cells preincubated in the absence of chronic insulin exhibited 5- or 6-fold increases in glycogen synthase activity in response to acute insulin or LiCl, respectively (Fig.7). In contrast, cells preincubated with insulin were completely resistant to restimulation with a second dose of insulin (1 μm, Fig. 7). Glycogen synthase activity in cells restimulated with insulin was equivalent to that in cells that had been maintained continuously in insulin for the entire 3 h (Fig. 7). This indicates that the lack of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity with prolonged treatment was not due to insulin degradation but to desensitization of insulin signaling to glycogen synthase. Interestingly, LiCl (50 mm) treatment of adipocytes preincubated with insulin stimulated glycogen synthase nearly 4-fold (Fig. 7). Therefore, LiCl is able to bypass, at least partially, the step(s) in the insulin signaling pathway that are desensitized, consistent with its site of action being much more proximal to glycogen synthase. To examine whether GSK3 might play a role in the insulin-induced desensitization of glycogen synthase activation, cells were incubated with insulin (1 μm) for 2 or 2.5 h in the presence or absence of LiCl (50 mm) prior to measurement of glycogen synthase activity. Cells preincubated in the absence of insulin and then acutely stimulated with insulin for 25 min exhibited an ∼4-fold increase in glycogen synthase activity (Fig.8). In contrast, glycogen synthase activity in cells incubated with insulin for 2 or 2.5 h was less than that observed in control cells (Fig. 8). Incubation with LiCl (50 mm) alone led to a 2-fold increase in glycogen synthase activity (Fig. 8). More importantly, preincubation with LiCl and inclusion of LiCl during the subsequent 2 h incubation with 1 μm insulin completely blocked the desensitization of glycogen synthase by prolonged insulin treatment (Fig. 8). Inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulates both glycogen synthase and glucose transport. The data presented here suggest that GSK3 modulates glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis via distinct mechanisms, acting at points upstream and downstream of PI3-kinase, respectively, as diagrammed schematically in Fig.9. In the basal state, GSK3 is active and inhibits glycogen synthesis directly by phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and conversion to the inactive form (Fig. 9 A). Evidence presented here and discussed below suggests that GSK3 inhibits glucose transport indirectly by negatively modulating events upstream of PI3-kinase, possibly tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2 (Fig. 9 A). The inhibition by wortmannin of glucose transport stimulated by LiCl and insulin suggests that PI3-kinase is required for the stimulatory action on glucose transport by both of these agents. The requirement for PI3-kinase activity in insulin-stimulated glucose transport is well documented (1.Taha C. Klip A. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, GSK3 is located downstream of PI3-kinase in the insulin signaling pathway (3.Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Therefore, a requirement for PI3-kinase for stimulation of glucose transport by GSK3 inhibition is consistent with a model whereby LiCl acts to relieve the negative modulation of upstream events by GSK3 (Fig. 9 B). The potentiation by LiCl of glucose transport stimulated by submaximal insulin (Fig. 1 B) is further evidence suggesting that GSK3 inhibition moderates an inhibitory influence on the insulin signaling pathway. The onset of glucose transport in response to insulin is rapid, reaching a maximal value at the earliest time examined (Fig. 4). In contrast, LiCl-stimulated transport increases gradually over 3–5 h. Transport stimulated by LiCl alone is much less than that in response to a maximal dose of insulin. This slow, partial activation is suggestive of a gradual shift in the basal state of signaling to glucose transport because of the moderation of a tonic inhibitory factor. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that endogenous GSK3 is acting to inhibit insulin signaling via phosphorylation of upstream components, possibly IRS-1, as has been previously suggested (11.Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Notably, IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation has not been observed to increase significantly in LiCl-treated adipocytes, 2S. J. Oreña and R. S. Garofalo, unpublished observations.suggesting that very small changes in the phosphorylation state may be sufficient to induce the increases in glucose transport seen in these studies. However, stimulation of PKB by a submaximal concentration of insulin was enhanced by LiCl treatment,2 consistent with GSK3 modulation of upstream signaling events. It was recently reported that glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was stimulated by lithium to a similar extent as that observed in the present studies but with little or no effect on GLUT4 translocation (7.Summers S.A. Kao A.W. Kohn A.D. Backus G.S. Roth R.A. Pessin J.E. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17934-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast to results shown here (Fig. 1 B), Summerset al. (7.Summers S.A. Kao A.W. Kohn A.D. Backus G.S. Roth R.A. Pessin J.E. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17934-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) also stated that LiCl did not augment insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, although it was not clear whether a submaximal concentration of insulin was used. The wortmannin sensitivity of lithium-stimulated glucose uptake reported here (Fig. 2) suggests PI3-kinase-dependent GLUT4 translocation as the mechanism of action, although a modification of preexisting plasma membrane glucose transporters cannot be excluded. Notably, data from Summers et al. (7.Summers S.A. Kao A.W. Kohn A.D. Backus G.S. Roth R.A. Pessin J.E. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17934-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) show a trend, albeit insignificant, for increased GLUT4 translocation with increasing lithium concentration. Because lithium-stimulated glucose uptake was only a small fraction of the maximal insulin-stimulated uptake in both studies, the amount of GLUT4 translocation that would account for such a minor increase in transport may be below the limit of detection of the GLUT4 sheet assay. Alternatively, because LiCl-stimulated glucose transport continues to increase for 3–5 h following its addition (Fig. 4), exposure to LiCl for longer than the 60 min used in the prior study may be required to see a significant increase in GLUT4 translocation. Overexpression of a nonregulatable form of GSK3 (S9A-GSK3β) in 3T3-L1 cells decreased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 30–40% at all insulin concentrations tested without changing the EC50 for insulin stimulation (7.Summers S.A. Kao A.W. Kohn A.D. Backus G.S. Roth R.A. Pessin J.E. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17934-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The relatively modest effect of GSK3 overexpression may be because of the fact that endogenous GSK3 is already active in the absence of insulin, providing a degree of negative tone. The increased GSK3 activity in transfected cells may provide additional inhibitory tone, consistent with a dampening of signaling to glucose transport at all insulin concentrations. Thus, one interpretation of all the data is that the basal level of transport can be reset in a negative or positive direction either by the addition of more GSK3 activity or inhibition of GSK3 with LiCl, respectively. Taken together, the data support an inhibitory role for GSK3 in glucose transport at a site upstream of PI3-kinase, although the precise mechanism remains to be defined. Selective inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl stimulates glycogen synthase more robustly than glucose transport, averaging 61% of the maximal insulin response, in a wortmannin-resistant manner. This is consistent with glycogen synthase being a direct substrate of GSK3 and with GSK3 playing a significant role in glycogen synthase regulation in adipocytes. Based on prior observations of low levels of GSK3 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, it was suggested that GSK3 inhibition plays a secondary role to activation of protein phosphatase-1 in insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase in these cells (32.Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33.Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M.Th. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, both GSK3β protein and enzyme activity were readily measured in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes employed in the present study. Furthermore, GSK3 inhibition and glycogen synthase activation in response to insulin appeared to be tightly coupled in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 6). Interestingly, LiCl plus a submaximal dose of insulin stimulated glycogen synthase to a greater extent than a maximal dose of insulin alone (Fig. 3). This suggests that the residual GSK3 activity not inhibited by insulin was sensitive to inhibition by LiCl and that further reduction in GSK3 activity contributes to greater activation of glycogen synthase. This is also consistent with the tight coupling of GSK3 inhibition and glycogen synthase activation observed in these cells. Insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 cells was transient, with activity returning to basal after 2 h of insulin treatment (Figs. 5 and 6). After 3 h in the presence of insulin, when GSK3 activity had returned to pretreatment levels, the glycogen synthase activity ratio was significantly below basal levels. The subsequent addition of insulin was unable to stimulate glycogen synthase (Fig. 7), indicating that insulin signaling to glycogen synthase had been desensitized. LiCl was able to bypass the block induced by pre-exposure to insulin and stimulate glycogen synthase, again suggesting that direct inhibition of GSK3 leads to glycogen synthase activation. Interestingly, when prolonged insulin treatment was carried out in the presence of LiCl, glycogen synthase activity remained elevated (Fig.8). This suggests that GSK3 activity is required for the inactivation and desensitization of glycogen synthase that occurs during prolonged insulin treatment. The mechanism of this desensitization is not clear, although the ability to bypass the block partially with LiCl suggests that insulin inhibition of GSK3 is blocked. Notably, the expression of a membrane-bound, constitutively active form of PKB also appears to desensitize insulin signaling to glycogen synthesis while stimulating glucose transport (34.Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence that persistent activation of the insulin signaling pathway in adipocytes can selectively block signaling to glycogen synthesis. In summary, inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl enhances insulin signaling to glucose transport and activates glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The effect of LiCl on glucose transport is upstream of PI3-kinase and is consistent with a model in which GSK3 plays a negative role in insulin signaling via phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (Fig. 9). The activities of glycogen synthase and GSK3 are reciprocally regulated in these cells and exhibit tight temporal correlation, suggesting that GSK3 plays an important role in the regulation of glycogen synthesis. Selective desensitization of glycogen synthase activation was observed with prolonged insulin treatment and appears to require GSK3 activity. Because impairment of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis is a common feature of type 2 diabetes (5.Shulman G.I. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 84: 3J-10JAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), further studies to understand its desensitization will be important to the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Down-regulation of striatin, which is expressed in a few subsets of neurons, impairs the growth of dendrites as well as rat locomotor activity (Bartoli, M., Ternaux, J.

All three proteins are both cytosolic and membrane-bound. All three bind calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+. In rat brain, SG2NA and striatin are generally not found in the same neurons.

Electron microscopy showed that it is present in the somato-dendritic compartment of neurons, especially in dendritic spines (1.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A.

Brain fractionation shows that striatin is both cytosolic and associated with membranes. This multimodular protein possesses, from the N to the C terminus, four domains mediating protein-protein interactions: a caveolin-binding domain (aa155–63) (3.Bartoli M. Gaillard S. Monneron A. European Congress of Cell Biology Book of Abstracts. European Cell Biology Organization, Bologna, Italy1999: 136-137Google Scholar), a putative coiled-coil structure (aa 70–116), a Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain (aa 149–166) (4.Bartoli M.

The WD repeat family is composed of homologous, structurally related, but functionally diverse proteins able to organize multiple simultaneous or consecutive protein-protein interactions (5.Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 24: 181-185Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The richness of striatin in domains mediating protein-protein interactions suggests that striatin is both a signaling protein and a multimodular platform protein. A study aimed at elucidating the function of striatin revealed two sets of data demonstrating its central role both in embryonic neurons and in adult brain (6.Bartoli M. Ternaux J.P. Forni C. Portalier P. Salin P. Amalric M. Monneron A. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 40: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the one hand, we showed that the expression of striatin is essential for the maintenance and growth of dendrites in rat embryonic motoneurons in culture. On the other hand, we showed that striatin is involved in the control of motor function in adult rats. Albeit a quantitatively minor protein, striatin thus appears to play major cellular and physiological roles. We have previously reported that the sequence of SG2NA, a 713 aa, supposedly nuclear protein discovered by Muro et al. (7.Muro Y. Chan E.K. Landberg G. Tan E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The expression pattern and domain organization of SG2NA were, however, not studied. The purpose of this work was to characterize SG2NA and to search for proteins homologous to striatin and SG2NA. Thanks to EST data bases, we found a novel protein, zinedin, that shares with striatin and SG2NA identical protein-protein interaction domains. The molecular cloning, chromosomal localization, biochemical properties, and tissue-specific expression of both zinedin and SG2NA are reported here. All three proteins bind CaM in the presence of Ca2+, suggesting that they may play a role in or depend upon Ca2+signaling. Within neurons, striatin and SG2NA are specifically addressed to dendrites. Because homologous proteins were found inCaenorhabditis elegans, fruit fly, Xenopus, and zebra fish, we could perform a phylogenetic analysis leading to the proposal that striatin, zinedin, and SG2NA are proteins deriving from an ancestral gene. Very recently, Moreno et al. (8.Moreno C.S. Park S. Nelson K. Ashby D. Hubalek F. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5257-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) hypothesized that striatin and SG2NA may target the catalytic subunit C of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to components of Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways. Their interesting suggestion is based upon the fact that striatin, SG2NA, and PP2A subunit C were found to coimmunoprecipitate within detergent complexes from lysed NIH-3T3 cells. However, a direct interaction between the C subunit of PP2A and striatin or SG2NA has not been demonstrated. From two human IMAGE clones (IMAGp998L041715 and IMAGp998F02295, obtained from Ressourcen Zentrum/Primär Datenbank), we obtained two pT7T3D-Pac plasmids (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pZin-a and pZin-b, which contain inserts of 1.65 kb (later known as nt 16–1665 of zinedin sequence) and 1.6 kb (nt 1631–3188 of zinedin sequence, terminated by a poly(A) stretch of 34 base pairs), respectively. They were sequenced (Eurosequence Gene Service, Paris, France). Screening of a mouse genomic library yielded the mouse exon containing an ATG codon. RT-PCR was performed using RNA from human NT2 cells (Stratagene), a mouse sense primer CCCGGGGCCTCCATGATG, and a human antisense primer GATTCTCCTGCCCTTTCCTC. The 328-base pair RT-PCR product was cloned and sequenced. The human zinedin cDNA sequence has been deposited in the EBI/GenBankTM data library under Accession no. AF212940 (Fig. 1). A PCR product was obtained using primers deduced from the human SG2NA sequence (Accession no. U17989) and a human brain cDNA library (Stratagene) as template. The labeled product was used to screen the library and yielded one positive clone. The plasmid from this clone was labeled and used to screen a human caudate nucleus cDNA library (CLONTECH). Nine positive clones were obtained, and two of them were overlapping. They were subcloned yielding pSG2NAhum. Total RNA from various mouse tissues were purified using TRIZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.). 12 μg of each RNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were stained with methylene blue. The SG2NA probe was a 619-nt BamHI/BamHI fragment obtained by digesting a plasmid from the mouse EST clone IMAGp998H131255 (RZPD). The zinedin probe was a 498-nt EcoRI/BamHI fragment obtained by digesting a plasmid from the mouse EST clone IMAGp998I14894 (RZPD). To obtain a mouse striatin probe, a plasmid pSTRI-mN was obtained by cloning into pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega), a mouse brain RT-PCR product spanning striatin sequence nt 1–1435 (Accession no. AJ223777); its insert was used as the probe. Probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (2–8.107 cpm) (Promega labeling system) and incubated with the mouse Northern blots overnight at 42 °C in the presence of formamide. The membranes were washed several times at 65 °C in 1× SSC containing 0.5% SDS and exposed at −70 °C. A human multitissue Northern blot was obtained fromCLONTECH and treated according to the manufacturer's instructions. It was analyzed using a human SG2NA probe (a PCR product obtained from pSG2NAhum and spanning nt 829–1178), a human zinedin probe (a PCR product obtained from pZin-a and spanning nt 595–936), as well as a β-actin probe (CLONTECH). Oligonucleotides containing engineered restriction sites (NcoI and EcoRI) were designed to amplify by PCR the partial coding sequences nt 829–1178 of SG2NA and nt 595–936 of zinedin, using plasmids pSG2NAhum and pZin-a as templates. These sequences code for peptides that bear no homologies between themselves or striatin. The purified PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T-easy vector. The plasmids were digested (NcoI and EcoRI), and the inserts were separated on agarose gels. The selected fragments were ligated into pGEX-NcoI vector (4.Bartoli M. Monneron A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), yielding plasmids pGST-SG2NA (encoding fusion protein GST-SG2NA 172–280) and pGST-ZIN (encoding fusion protein GST-zinedin 203–307). JM107 Escherichia coli competent cells were transformed. Recombinant clones were screened for expression of the corresponding GST fusion proteins following isopropyl-thiogalactopyranoside induction. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified fusion proteins GST-SG2NA 172–280 and GST-zinedin 203–307 were each injected into two rabbits (60–120 μg/injection) monthly over 8 months. Protein determinations and Western blots were made as described (1.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Antibodies were affinity-purified. For this purpose, 160 μg of each fusion protein were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Strips containing the fusion proteins were cut out, blocked in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 2% nonfat dry milk. They were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 4 ml of 10-fold diluted antiserum. The strips were then washed, and antibodies were eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.5. The eluates were neutralized and, after addition of 0.1% bovine serum albumin, kept in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Antibodies were tested on Western blots of rat brain homogenate and of the purified fusion proteins themselves, to ascertain that none was cross-reactive toward the other related proteins. Frozen tissues (heart, skeletal muscle, brain, cerebellum, kidney, lung, liver, and spleen) from 3-month-old mice were homogenized in TBS containing 1 mm EDTA and inhibitors of proteases using a polytron (4.Bartoli M. Monneron A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The various homogenates were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C; the cytosols were saved, and their protein concentrations determined (micro BCA method, Pierce). Rat brain fractionation was achieved as described (4.Bartoli M. Monneron A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Normalized amounts (100 μg) of protein of each fraction were analyzed in triplicate on 8% SDS- polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The blots were stained with Ponceau red. Striatin, zinedin, and SG2NA were revealed by their respective antibodies, using the ECL procedure. Striatin was revealed using affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies (1.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), SG2NA and zinedin were revealed with the affinity-purified antibodies described above. A cytosolic fraction of rat brain was prepared as described in ice-cold TBS containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Ca2+, and inhibitors of proteases (TBS-A). 150 μg of cytosolic protein was adjusted to 1 mm Ca2+ and incubated with 1.5 ml of CaM-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C, with gentle agitation. Each experiment involved triplicate batches of resin. The unretained fraction was saved. The resins were washed with 15 ml of TBS-A followed by 15 ml of TBS. Bound proteins were eluted with 15 ml of TBS buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. Proportional aliquots of cytosol, unretained fractions, and EDTA eluates were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Western blots were revealed by anti-striatin, anti-SG2NA, and anti-zinedin affinity-purified antibodies, using the ECL procedure. To localize the zinedin gene, a plasmid pZINhum was obtained by cloning into pGEM-T-easy vector an RT-PCR product spanning human zinedin nt 128–3122. This RT-PCR was obtained using RNA from NT2 cells. pZINhum was biotinylated with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche) by nick translation. Hybridization to chromosome spreads were performed using 300–400 ng of biotinylated DNA/slide (9.Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2964) Google Scholar) and were revealed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Vector). Chromosomes were counterstained and R-banded as described (10.Lemieux N. Dutrillaux B. Viegas-Pequignot E. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 59: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). 50 human metaphase cells were analyzed. The prediction for WD repeats was realized according to the program developed on the WD repeat protein web site. The prediction for coiled-coils was realized with the programs Coil (11.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) and Paircoil (12.Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). To build a phylogenetic tree, the protein multi-alignment was performed using the Clustal W program (13.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). This tree was inferred by using the neighbor-joining method with percentage of acceptable point mutation distance of the PHYLO-WIN program (14.Galtier N. Gouy M. Gautier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar). The reliability of the results were analyzed by the bootstrap method (500 repeats). Adult Wistar rats were deeply anesthetized using a mixture of 0.5 ml of Imalgène 1000 (Rhône-Mérieux) and 0.37 ml of Rompun (Bayer). They were transcardially perfused with 400 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was removed and postfixed overnight in the same solution at 4 °C. 30–40-μm Vibratome sections were cut and processed for immunocytochemistry at the optical level, using the pre-embedding immunoperoxidase method (15.Bernard V. Somogyi P. Bolam J.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 819-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline, preincubated for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% normal goat serum, and incubated overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% normal goat serum and either affinity-purified anti-SG2NA antibodies (0.2 μg/ml) or, as controls, the same solution of antibodies preincubated with the antigen (nitrocellulose strip containing the fusion protein) and also unimmunized rabbit antibodies (Sigma) (0.2 μg/ml). Sections were washed, incubated for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Vector Laboratories, 1/200), washed, incubated for 1 h in an avidin-biotin-peroxidase solution, and washed. Peroxidase was revealed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in the presence of 0.1% H202 with nickel salt enhancement for 2–5 min. Sections were dehydrated, mounted in Eukitt (Labonord, France), and viewed with a Leica microscope. The full-length human striatin sequence was used for a TBLASTN search (16.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) of the NCBI EST data base. A number of matching ESTs were found. Their analysis allowed the identification of a hitherto unknown protein, both in man and mouse, homologous to striatin and SG2NA. We determined the sequence of the deduced human cDNA, which encodes a protein of 753 aa, called zinedin (Fig.1). The ATG codon lies within a canonical eukaryotic translation start sequence (17.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar). The 3′-noncoding sequence is terminated by a poly(A) stretch of 34 base pairs. The protein sequence of zinedin encompasses four stretches homologous to those that in striatin encode domains involved in protein-protein interactions (Fig. 2). They are, from the N to the C terminus: a putative caveolin-binding domain (aa 71–79, 89% identical to striatin), a putative coiled-coil structure (aa 86–132, 94% identical), a putative CaM-binding domain (aa 165–182, 79% identical), and a WD repeat domain (aa 395–753, 61% identical). These domains are distributed in the same way as they are in striatin. The chromosomal position of the human zinedin gene was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. In 85% of the metaphases, a fluorescent signal was detected in the q13.2 band on the long arm of chromosome 19 (Fig. 3). As already mentioned, the human protein sequence of SG2NA is 80% homologous to the sequence of striatin (1.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These homologies concern all the protein-protein interaction domains that have been described in striatin, from the N to the C terminus: a putative caveolin-binding domain (aa 71–79, 89% identical to striatin), a putative coiled-coil structure (aa 86–132, 94% identical), a CaM-binding domain (166–183, 94% identical), and a WD repeat domain (aa 353–753, 70% identical) (Fig. 2). While screening a human caudate nucleus cDNA library with a SG2NA probe, we cloned a partial SG2NA cDNA (nt 560 to 2554) containing, in addition to the SG2NA published sequence, a 252-nt stretch starting at nt 1191 (arrow in Fig. 2 A); the corresponding, putative protein, was called SG2NAβ (Accession no. AF 243424). The SG2N gene is present in the BAC clone R-829H16 from the human chromosome 14 library (Accession no. AL049830). Its sequence spans 130 kb pairs and contains 18 exons in the coding region corresponding to SG2NAβ. The sequence of SG2NA is devoid of exons 8 and 9. To more precisely map SG2N on chromosome 14, we realized thein situ hybridization of metaphase cells. SG2N lies in the 14q13-q21 region (not shown). Proteins homologous to striatin, zinedin, and SG2NA are present in metazoa throughout their evolution; they have been detected in nonmammalian vertebrates (Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis) and in nonvertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans) but not in yeast (18.Moqrich A. Mattei M.G. Bartoli M. Rakitina T. Baillat G. Monneron A. Castets F. Genomics. 1998; 51: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that the present members of the striatin family derive from an ancestral gene (Fig. 4). Altogether, they are thus entitled to define a family of multimodular proteins, which we propose to name the striatin family. Furthermore, the structures of the human SG2N gene and of the available part of the human STRN gene (clone NH0288C18, Accession no. AC007382) are identical, with the same intron-exon borders. Finally, we have localized the human genes encoding striatin, SG2NA, and zinedin to chromosomes 2p21-p22 (18.Moqrich A. Mattei M.G. Bartoli M. Rakitina T. Baillat G. Monneron A. Castets F. Genomics. 1998; 51: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), 14q13-q21, and 19q13.2. We found that the human genes of two multigenic families, the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger family (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 localized to chromosomes 2p21-p23, 19q13.2, and 14q21-q31, respectively) (19.Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and the CaM family (CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3 localized to chromosomes 14q24-q31, 2p21.1-p21.3, and 19q13.2-q13.3, respectively) (20.Berchtold M.W. Egli R. Rhyner J.A. Hameister H. Strehler E.E. Genomics. 1993; 16: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) are in close proximity to the striatin, SG2NA, and zinedin gene loci. Transcripts of the genes encoding striatin, zinedin, and SG2NA were identified in normalized mouse multitissue Northern blot triplicates (Fig. 5). As already described (1.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), two mouse striatin transcripts of 8 and 6 kb were mostly detected in brain and in cerebellum. One 4-kb mouse zinedin transcript was detected in the brain and cerebellum. One 4.5-kb mouse SG2NA transcript was mostly expressed in the brain, cerebellum, and skeletal muscle. Upon longer exposure of the blots, weak signals were detected with all probes in various tissues such as spleen, skeletal muscle and lung for striatin, kidney for zinedin, spleen, kidney and lung for SG2NA. A human Northern blot was also analyzed with probes corresponding to human sequences (not shown). We found little correlation between the data obtained with the mouse and human Northern blots; for instance, the SG2NA probe gave practically no signal in brain. However, the normalization of the human RNAs was questionable (absence or low level of the actin transcript in several human tissues that express actin). We therefore tend to think that the results obtained with the mouse Northern blots are more reliable. Next, the proteins themselves, striatin, zinedin, and SG2NA were searched for in several mouse tissues by Western blotting (Fig.6 A). The blots were probed with affinity-purified antibodies specific for each protein. Indeed, no cross-reaction of any of the antibodies had been detected on blots of the three fusion proteins (not shown). As shown previously, an antibody raised against an unconserved striatin peptide revealed a 114-kDa protein, principally in the brain and cerebellum. Very weak signals were detected in the lung and spleen. Anti-zinedin antibodies detected a 100-kDa protein present in the brain, cerebellum, and lung; this protein was very weakly detected in the heart, kidney, and spleen. Anti-SG2NA antibodies produced signals in almost all tissues. The signals were strongest in brain, cerebellum, muscle, and lung. Using two different sets of anti-SG2NA antibodies, three proteins of 112, 102, and 94 kDa were detected in the brain and cerebellum. In the heart, skeletal muscle, and lung, the antibodies only detected the 94-kDa species. In kidney, an additional protein of 90 kDa was weakly detected. To be sure that the 112-kDa species of SG2NA and striatin were indeed different proteins, a mixture of the three antibodies was used in Western blotting; the two proteins did not comigrate (Fig.6 B, lane 4). Transduction Laboratories developed a monoclonal antibody against striatin (S 66020) with the antigen being a peptide spanning aa 450–600. In Fig. 6 B, lane 5, it can be seen that this antibody recognizes both striatin and zinedin. The major tissular localizations of SG2NA given by the Western blot are in good agreement with that obtained from the Northern blot, except for lung. In the case of zinedin, the level of protein expression in lung is larger than expected from the Northern blot. On the whole, all three proteins are mostly expressed in brain and in the case of SG2NA, in muscle. Striatin migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an anomalous apparentM r 114,000 (theoreticalM r 86,225) (1.Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Likewise, SG2NA and zinedin display anomalous electrophoretic behaviors migrating at apparentM r 112,000, 102,000, and 94,000 for SG2NA and 100,000 for zinedin (theoretical M r 80,592) (Fig. 6). Brain striatin is found both in the cytosol and in the membrane fraction. In brain homogenates, 58% of striatin (4.Bartoli M. Monneron A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and 50–52% of zinedin and SG2NA are membrane-bound and released by detergents (data not shown). We previously showed that striatin (native and recombinant) binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that its CaM-binding domain spans aa 149–166 (4.Bartoli M. Monneron A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sequences similar to the latter are found in zinedin and SG2NA (Fig.7 A). To test the ability of zinedin and of the three species of SG2NA to bind CaM in vitro, rat brain cytosol was incubated with CaM-Sepharose in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+. As shown in Fig.7 B, zinedin quantitatively bound CaM-Sepharose and was eluted in the presence of EDTA. Moreno et al. (8.Moreno C.S. Park S. Nelson K. Ashby D. Hubalek F. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5257-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) have shown that the 94-kDa species of SG2NA binds CaM-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+. Fig. 7 B shows that the two other species of SG2NA detected in brain also bound CaM and were eluted by EDTA. Affinity-purified anti-SG2NA antibodies were used. Control sections (using either the primary antibodies preincubated with the immobilized antigen or antibodies from unimmunized animals) were unstained (Fig. 8 D). Whatever the tissue (brain or adrenal gland), the cytoplasm, not the nuclei, were immunostained (Fig. 8). In brain sections, many types of brain cells, neurons as well as glial cells, were positive. In all neurons, SG2NA immunoreactivity was present in dendrites but not in axons. In the cerebellum, the soma and dendrites of the Purkinje cells, down to their distal branches, were strongly stained (Fig. 8, A andB). In the granular layer, only the Golgi cells were immunoreactive (Fig. 8 A). The large aspiny interneurons of striatum were intensely immunostained, whereas the spiny, efferent neurons were negative (Fig. 8 C). Hippocampal pyramidal and granular cells were strongly reactive (not shown). A few nuclei, such as the trigeminal and the cochlear nuclei, were intensely stained. In the white matter, astrocytes were immunostained in tracts that do not contain neurons. We also studied SG2NA immunoreactivity in the adrenal gland, a tissue of neural origin. The medulla was strongly reactive, whereas the cortex was not (Fig. 8 E). As shown in Western blots, zinedin is mostly expressed in brain. However, although the anti-zinedin antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate brain native zinedin, they could not be used for immunocytochemistry. Aldehyde fixation of the brain, even using as low a paraformaldehyde concentration as 0.5%, resulted in the absence of zinedin immunoreactivity, most probably because the epitope was drastica"
https://openalex.org/W2033229710,"Recent genetic evidence indicates that null mutants of the 5′-flap endonuclease (FEN1) result in an expansion of repetitive sequences. The substrate for FEN1 is a flap formed by natural 5′-end displacement of the short intermediates of lagging strand replication. FEN1 binds the 5′-end of the flap, tracks to the point of annealing at the base of the flap, and then cleaves. Here we examine mechanisms by which foldback structures within the flap could contribute to repeat expansions. Cleavage by FEN1 was reduced with increased length of the foldback. However, even the longest foldbacks were cleaved at a low rate. Substrates containing the repetitive sequence CTG also were cleaved at a reduced rate. Bubble substrates, likely intermediates in repeat expansions, were inhibitory. Neither replication protein A nor proliferating cell nuclear antigen were able to assist in the removal of secondary structure within a flap. We propose that FEN1 cleaves natural foldbacks at a reduced rate. However, although the cleavage delay is not likely to influence the overall process of chromosomal replication, specific foldbacks could inhibit cleavage sufficiently to result in duplication of the foldback sequence.

Enzymes first identified as central components of DNA replication forks, such as the flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1),1 are now understood to play critical roles in DNA repair pathways (1.Harrington J.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Genetic studies highlight the central role of FEN1 in these cellular processes (12.Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4291-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a null mutant of the FEN1 homologue (RAD27/RTH1) is conditionally lethal at high temperatures producing a cellular morphology indicative of an S phase arrest. At the permissive temperature, FEN1 mutants exhibit slow growth and hyper-recombination phenotypes consistent with defects in DNA replication and recombination. Null mutants also have an increased sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate but are only moderately affected by UV or ionizing radiation. These characteristics are consistent with participation of FEN1 in base excision repair. Biochemical analyses have clarified the nature of the FEN1 catalyzed reactions during DNA replication and repair. Reconstitution of lagging strand DNA synthesis in vitro showed that FEN1 is needed to remove the initiator RNA primers of Okazaki fragments (3.Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). FEN1 assists in primer removal through two proposed pathways. First, the nuclease RNase HI cleaves within the RNA primer leaving a single ribonucleotide remaining at the 5′-end of the Okazaki fragment. The FEN1 nuclease removes this ribonucleotide prior to ligation with an upstream Okazaki fragment (9.Turchi J.J. Huang L. Murante R.S. Kim Y. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9803-9807Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Alternately, synthesis from an upstream Okazaki fragment may cause the displacement of the RNA primer generating an unannealed 5′-tail or flap structure (15.Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 16.Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). FEN1 cleaves endonucleolytically at the base of the flap, thereby removing the entire segment of RNA (17.Murante R.S. Huang L. Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25888-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The endonucleolytic activity of FEN1 is thought to be important for the removal of damaged nucleotides in long patch base excision repair (11.Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,20.Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). During repair of an abasic site, an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease cleaves on the 5′-side of the abasic sugar generating a nick within the DNA (21.Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that FEN1 cannot remove the abasic sugar (22.DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Instead, when the damaged sugar and an additional downstream nucleotide are displaced to generate a flap, FEN1 endonucleolytically removes the site of damage as part of an oligomer. The resulting short gap is filled and ligated to complete the repair process. FEN1 employs a unique cleavage mechanism for substrates containing unannealed 5′-tails or flap structures (Fig.1). FEN1 removes the flap by recognizing the 5′-end, tracking the length of the tail, and cleaving at the point of annealing (1.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 18.Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

However, the unannealed 5′-tail must be single-stranded as the presence of large adducts (18.Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or annealed primers prevent FEN1 cleavage (18.Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Biophysical analysis of homologues has begun to provide a structural context for understanding the molecular mechanism of FEN1. Crystal structures of FEN1 homologues from T5 exonuclease (29.Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), T4 RNase H (30.Mueser T.C.

Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) reveal a helical arch or loop above a globular domain containing the active site. This arch may be utilized by the nuclease to track onto the 5′-end of a flap structure (29.Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of the loop region in the M. jannaschii FEN1 indicate that this physical structure is critical for both the binding and cleaving of flap substrates (31.Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Previous results show that the ability of the FEN1 endonuclease to cleave flap structures is affected by a range of modifications of the unannealed 5′-tail. These modifications include the addition of large adducts such as biotin-streptavidin complexes (18.Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), small adducts (cis-platinum) (33.Barnes C.J. Wahl A.F. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that FEN1 tracks down the length of the tail before reaching the cleavage point. However, it still remains unknown whether FEN1 “tracks” by threading the length of the flap through an arch structure (35.Sayers J.R. Artymiuk P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or whether the nuclease grips the flap in the manner of enzymes with thumb domains (36.Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recent studies utilizing flap substrates containing a branch structure permit cleavage by FEN1 (34.Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results suggest a tracking process in which the flap is not completely encircled. In addition to DNA replication and repair, genetic and biochemical data also connect FEN1 with repeat sequence expansion. Many human genetic diseases are characterized by a substantial alteration of the genome. One class of changes observed involve a unique group of sequences referred to as repetitive sequences. These stretches of the genome contain either single, dinucleotide, or trinucleotide sequences repeated in an array of several to about 60 nucleotides (microsatellites) or longer 4–100-nucleotide sequences repeated to greater lengths (minisatellites) (37.Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Repeat expansions have attracted attention particularly because of their link with a host of genetic conditions called human triplet repeat disorders (38.McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1823-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These disorders include several neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and some colon cancers. A notable characteristic of these sequences is their ability to adopt higher ordered structures such as hairpin loops both in vitro (39.Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juranic N. Macura S. McMurray C.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar,40.Gacy A.M. McMurray C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9426-9434Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in vivo (41.Moore H. Greenwell P.W. Liu C.P. Arnheim N. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although the expansion of repetitive sequences is well described with regard to the alterations seen in patients, information on the mechanism of expansion only recently has become available. First, the nature of the sequence itself influences expansion. Examination of families with Huntington's disease indicates that the rate of expansion is strongly linked to DNA sequence (38.McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1823-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As a result of the repeating nature of the sequences, regions that expand are able to adopt secondary structure. In addition, an increase in expansion rate is seen if the sequences are located on the lagging strand during DNA replication in yeast (42.Freudenreich C.H. Stavenhagen J.B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 43.Maurer D.J. O'Callaghan B.L. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4597-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been observed in yeast that mutations in the proteins FEN1 and replication factor C lead to an increase in the length of repetitive sequences (37.Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 44.Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S.

These observations suggest that repeat sequences expand during the RNA removal and joining steps of Okazaki fragment processing. Most likely foldbacks formed from the repeat sequences interfere with the required cleavage reaction of FEN1. Because primers annealed to a flap inhibit cleavage, a foldback in the flap is anticipated to inhibit by a similar mechanism. The resulting delay in the removal of flaps with foldbacks leads to an expansion of the repeat. These phenotypes of yeast are relevant to human FEN1 not only because the two nucleases exhibit a high degree of sequence homology but also because human FEN1 will rescue the defects of the null mutant in yeast (50.Greene A.L. Snipe J.R. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The link between the structure of repetitive sequences and the mechanism of FEN1 has led to the proposal of a model to explain repeat expansion (37.Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). During DNA synthesis, displacement by a polymerase or helicase allows repetitive sequences to self-anneal forming secondary structure such as a hairpin loop or foldback within the DNA. Equilibration of this intermediate with the template would form a “bubble” intermediate. Synthesis from the upstream primer and ligation would prevent any further degradation of the extra repeats. Resolution of this structure during replication would lead to expansion (Fig. 1). The model explains expansion of both trinucleotide repeats and the longer minisatellite repeats. Using a series of substrates designed to adopt secondary structure, we have examined the ability of FEN1 to resolve the foldback and bubble structures formed in the model. In addition, we examined the ability of PCNA and RPA, which stimulate FEN1 activity, to assist in the removal of these intermediates. Results suggest that the model correctly describes a mechanism for repeat expansion. Oligonucleotides were synthesized either by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or by Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). Radionucleotides [γ-32P]ATP (6000 or 3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. T4 polynucleotide kinase and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (labeling grade) were from Roche Diagnostics. All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. Recombinant human FEN1 was expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli utilizing the T7 expression plasmid pET-FCH (34.Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recombinant PCNA was expressed in E. coli using the expression vector pT7/PCNA (51.Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or RG84A (52.Gary R. Ludwig D.L. Cornelius H.L. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and purified. Purified FEN1 and PCNA were dialyzed into storage buffer (30 mmHEPES, pH 7.6 (diluted from a 1 m stock), 30 mmKCl, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant human RPA was expressed and purified from E. coli using expression vector p11d-tRPA (53.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to form a series of flap or bubble substrates. For flap substrates, the 3′-end of each downstream primer is complementary to the 5′-end of its appropriate template. The 5′-end of the downstream primer forms the unannealed 5′-tail or flap. Within the 5′-end of downstream primers containing secondary structure is an inverted repeat that forms a hairpin loop or foldback. The length of the stem varies from 6–24 nucleotides. Upstream primers anneal to the 3′-end of the template forming a nick at the base of the flap. Bubble substrates contain 25 nucleotides of complementarity at both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the primers, generating an internal unannealed region. Upstream primers anneal to this internal region, forming a nick at the 3′-end of the bubble. Oligomer sequences are listed in TableI.

The bold nucleotide represents the first position annealed to the template Tstem. Open table in a new tab Prior to annealing, downstream primers were radiolabeled at either the 5′- or 3′-end. Primers (10 pmol) were 5′-end radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase asper the manufacturer's instructions. For 3′-end radiolabeled primers, downstream primers (10 pmol) were annealed to template LAH2.7 (25 pmol), which generates a 5′-overhang and extended with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow polymerase at 37 °C for 3 h. After removal of unincorporated radionucleotides by a Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography column (Bio-Rad), all radiolabeled primers were purified by gel isolation from either a 10% or 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel. Substrates were generated by annealing a downstream primer, template, and upstream primer at a molar ratio of 1:2.5:5, respectively. A downstream primer and template were placed in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8 and 1 mm EDTA) and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. The reaction was placed at 70 °C and allowed to slowly cool to 25 °C. After an upstream primer was added, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to 1 h. Assays contained the indicated amounts of substrate and FEN1 in reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 (diluted from a 1 m stock), 40 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol or 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in a final volume of 20 μl. Assays were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of termination dye (95% formamide (v/v) with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, samples were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide, 7 murea denaturing gel. Products were detected by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed using ImageQuant v1.2 software from Molecular Dynamics. All assays were performed at least in triplicate. We propose that certain FEN1 substrates form secondary structures that influence the kinetics and specificity of cleavage. We examined FEN1 cleavage on substrates with foldbacks in the flap and bubble structure intermediates. This permits us to assess their importance in the context of the model for repeat expansions. To determine whether FEN1 cleaves flaps containing secondary structure, we designed substrates with an inverted repeat within the 5′-end of the flap that forms a stem-loop structure. The length of the annealed region of the stem varied from 6 to 24 nucleotides, and the loop contained 6 nucleotides. To control for the effect of sequence, each of the stem loops had similar nucleotide composition and GC content. The control substrate contained a 26-nucleotide flap consisting mostly of thymidine residues producing an unannealed 5′-tail devoid of secondary structure. All other sequences were identical for each substrate. The downstream primers of the substrates were radiolabeled at the 5′-end. The substrates were exposed to increasing amounts of FEN1 (Fig.2). Addition of FEN1 to the control substrate releases a 25-nucleotide product (lanes 1–5) representing cleavage at the base of the flap. If the presence of secondary structure had no effect on FEN1 activity, the expected products would be 24, 36, and 60 nucleotides in length for the 6, 12, and 24 nucleotide stem substrates, respectively. FEN1 is only able to readily cleave the 6-nucleotide stem (lanes 6–10) with similar specificity as the flap with no foldback. Cleavage of the 12-nucleotide stem (lanes 11–15) yields both a full-length product from release of the 5′-tail and more significant levels of mono- and dinucleotide products. Cleavage of the 24-nucleotide stem resulted in only the smaller mono- and dinucleotide products (lanes 16–20). As the foldback stem became more stable with increasing length, FEN1 was blocked from cleaving directly at the base of the flap. Instead, FEN1 cleaved the 5′-end of the self-annealed tail, generating mono- or dinucleotide products. These products are expected because the foldback is a substrate for the 5′-exonuclease activity of FEN1 (1.Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Appearance of the mono- and dinucleotide products also confirms the ability of each sequence to adopt the predicted secondary structure, because FEN1 is an obligate double-stranded exonuclease. As the length of the annealed region increases, so does the stability of the foldback, allowing the nuclease to more efficiently attack the 5′-end. However, cleavage of the 5′-radiolabeled nucleotide prevents further analysis regarding the fate of the stem loop present within the flap. It is possible that FEN1 continued to cleave as an exonuclease until the double-stranded region was sufficiently small that the stem melted, forming a more favorable flap structure for FEN1. For further examination of the effect of secondary structure, substrates were radiolabeled at the 3′-end of the downstream primer and incubated with increasing amounts of FEN1. To determine more precisely the length of secondary structure necessary to influence FEN1 activity, the annealed regions of the stems were made 6, 12, 18, and 24 nucleotides long. Because the length of the annealed downstream region of each substrate is identical, cleavage by FEN1 resulted in the generation of a 19-mer for all substrates (Fig.3 A). FEN1 cleavage was easily detectable on the control substrate and substrates containing 6 and 12 nucleotides (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–15). The ability of FEN1 to cleave the 18- and 24-nucleotide stem substrates is significantly reduced (Fig. 3 A, lanes 16–25). At higher levels of FEN1, additional cleavage products smaller than the 19-mer are observed. These are the result of exonucleolytic cleavage within the annealed double-stranded region of the downstream primer. We also observed some exonucleolytic removal of the 5′-end as expected from the results of Fig. 2. Production of the 19-mer does not appear to derive from progressive exonucleolytic cleavag"

In this study, we show that p21-activated kinase 1, the activity of which is regulated by the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and Rac and by sphingosine, is phosphorylated by PDK1. Phosphorylation of p21-activated kinase 1 by PDK1 occurred only in the presence of sphingosine, which increased PDK1 autophosphorylation 25-fold. Sphingosine increased PDK1 autophosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner and significantly increased phosphate incorporation into known PDK1 substrates. Studies on the lipid requirement for PDK1 activation found that both sphingosine isoforms and stearylamine also increased PDK1 autophosphorylation. However, C10-sphingosine, octylamine, and stearic acid were unable to increase PDK1 autophosphorylation, indicating that both a positive charge and a lipid tail containing at least a C10-carbon backbone were required for PDK1 activation. Three PDK1 autophosphorylation sites were identified after stimulation with sphingosine in a serine-rich region located between the kinase domain and the pleckstrin homology domain using two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy. Increased phosphorylation of endogenous Akt at threonine 308 was observed in COS-7 cells expressing wild type PDK1, but not catalytically inactive PDK1, when cellular sphingosine levels were elevated by treatment with sphingomyelinase. Sphingosine thus appears to be a true PDK1 activator. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) has previously been shown to phosphorylate the activation loop of several AGC kinase family members.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Activation of PAK1 is characterized by autophosphorylation of 7–8 serine/threonine amino acids and an increase in substrate phosphorylation (10.Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen Z.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is not an AGC kinase family member, PAK1 contains a conserved threonine in kinase subdomain VIII equivalent to the PDK1 phosphorylation site in AGC kinase family members. Although this site has been reported to be a PAK1 autophosphorylation site, we wanted to determine whether this site in a catalytically inactive PAK1 construct could serve as a PDK1 phosphorylation site.In this study, we show that PDK1 phosphorylates PAK1 in the presence of sphingosine but not of Cdc42-GTPγS. Incubation of wild type PDK1, but not catalytically inactive PDK1, with sphingosine increased both autophosphorylation and the incorporation of phosphate into PDK1 substrates in vitro and in vivo dramatically, indicating that the enzymatic activity of PDK1 can be modified by sphingosine and related lipids. A closer examination of the lipid requirement for PDK1 activation indicates that a positively charged head group and a hydrophobic tail with at least a C10-carbon backbone is required for activation of PDK1. Our data also identify a serine-rich region between the amino-terminal kinase domain and the carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain as the region of sphingosine-stimulated autophosphorylation.DISCUSSIONUntil recently, PDK1 activity was thought to be constitutive. However, it was recently shown that PDK1 activity could be stimulated modestly (∼2-fold) by PtdIns 3,4,5 P3 in the presence of PDK1-interacting factor (14.Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that sphingosine acts independently of PtdIns 3,4,5 P3 to stimulate PDK1 autophosphorylation 25-fold and increases phosphate incorporation into known and novel PDK1 substrates. These findings suggest that regulatory events other than localization of PDK1 and its substrates by PtdIns 3,4,5 P3 may be required for efficient signal transduction. Localization of PDK1 to the membranes by increased PtdIns 3,4,5 P3 levels is an important mechanism for bringing the enzyme in proximity to substrates. In this study, we show that increased activity of PDK1 in the absence of localization also contributes to phosphorylation of substrate. Overexpression of wild type or catalytically inactive (K111Q) PDK1 results in a ubiquitous distribution of the protein in COS-7 cells, as determined by immunofluorescence, probably placing potential substrates within close proximity to the expressed PDK1. Treatment of these cells with sphingomyelinase increases intracellular sphingosine levels but not PtdIns 3,4,5 P3 levels. Under these conditions, activation of PDK1 and phosphorylation of Akt at threonine 308 are observed.Although we showed that increases in intracellular sphingosine levels can result in the phosphorylation of Akt in a PDK1-dependent manner, the question remains whether these sphingosine levels can be reached during cellular activation. Resting intracellular sphingosine levels have been estimated to be in the low micromolar range but could be much higher in microdomains within the cell or after a stimulatory event (17.Merrill A.H. Stevens V.L. Boichem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular sphingosine levels were shown to increase endogenous Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308 by a process that requires wild type PDK1 but not catalytically inactive PDK1. These data suggest that intracellular concentrations of sphingosine generated in response to stimuli are sufficient to activate PDK1. Previous work in our laboratory (9.Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M.

Other studies have implicated elevated intracellular sphingosine levels on activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (18.Hashizume T. Nakao M. Sato T. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and other unidentified kinases (19.Pushkareva M.Y. Khan W.A. Alessenko A.V. Sahyoun N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

The levels of sphingosine required for these events to occur are in the same range as the levels required for PDK1 activation.During the preparation of this report, Casamayor et al. (21.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) identified five PDK1 autophosphorylation sites. One serine residue (serine 241), the activation loop serine, was identified as a constitutively phosphorylated site. Our two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps also identify a constitutively phosphorylated residue (Fig. 4,arrow) that may represent this site. Casameyer et al. (21.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) also identified two autophosphorylation sites within the serine-rich region (serine 393 and 396). Our data clearly show three autophosphorylation sites within this region, suggesting that autophosphorylation of PDK1 after stimulation with sphingosine results in the appearance of at least one novel autophosphorylation site. It is unclear at this time whether the autophosphorylation sites identified by Casamayor et al. (21.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) differ from the sites we saw after stimulation. Studies are currently under way to determine which sites within this region are the sites of autophosphorylation.Based on the data presented here, localization and activation of PDK1 may require two separate lipid signals: PtdIns 3,4,5 P3, which is necessary for localization of PDK1 to membranes, where it colocalizes with substrates, and sphingosine, which is required for full activation of the enzyme. Such regulation might be pertinent during signal transduction through growth factor receptors, such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Platelet-derived growth factor is known to up-regulate many different signal transduction pathways, including synthesis of PtdIns 3,4,5 P3 through phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase (22.Bornfeldt K.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) has shown that sphingosine levels increase significantly upon addition of sphingomyelinase or other sphingosine elevating agents in COS-7 cells. Other studies have implicated elevated intracellular sphingosine levels on activation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (18.Hashizume T. Nakao M. Sato T. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and other unidentified kinases (19.Pushkareva M.Y. Khan W.A. Alessenko A.V. Sahyoun N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15246-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the inhibition of protein kinase C (20.Hunnun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of sphingosine required for these events to occur are in the same range as the levels required for PDK1 activation. During the preparation of this report, Casamayor et al. (21.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) identified five PDK1 autophosphorylation sites. One serine residue (serine 241), the activation loop serine, was identified as a constitutively phosphorylated site. Our two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps also identify a constitutively phosphorylated residue (Fig. 4,arrow) that may represent this site. Casameyer et al. (21.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) also identified two autophosphorylation sites within the serine-rich region (serine 393 and 396). Our data clearly show three autophosphorylation sites within this region, suggesting that autophosphorylation of PDK1 after stimulation with sphingosine results in the appearance of at least one novel autophosphorylation site. It is unclear at this time whether the autophosphorylation sites identified by Casamayor et al. (21.Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) differ from the sites we saw after stimulation. Studies are currently under way to determine which sites within this region are the sites of autophosphorylation. Based on the data presented here, localization and activation of PDK1 may require two separate lipid signals: PtdIns 3,4,5 P3, which is necessary for localization of PDK1 to membranes, where it colocalizes with substrates, and sphingosine, which is required for full activation of the enzyme. Such regulation might be pertinent during signal transduction through growth factor receptors, such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Platelet-derived growth factor is known to up-regulate many different signal transduction pathways, including synthesis of PtdIns 3,4,5 P3 through phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase (22.Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Graves L.M. Skinner M.P. Krebs E.B. Ross R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and elevation of intracellular sphingosine (23.Fatatis A. Miller R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4351-4358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is possible that coordination of these two lipid signals in cells is required for maximal activity of PDK1 toward substrates. We thank Ben P. Bohl, Martine R. Wayne, and Wesley D.

In this report, we present evidence suggesting that ATF3 represses the transcription of its own gene. Interestingly, efficient repression requires a consensus ATF/cAMP-responsive element site in the promoter and a previously unidentified ATF3-binding site immediately downstream from the TATA box. Although this new site resembles the known ATF/cAMP-responsive element sequences at the flanking sequence, it differs from them at the center key residues. These observations indicate that ATF3 can tolerate variations in the center of the binding sites if the flanking sequences are favorable. The repression of the ATF3 promoter by its own gene product provides a mechanistic explanation, at least in part, for the transient expression pattern of the ATF3 gene upon stress induction.

Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Many lines of evidence indicate that stress signals initiate a cascade of phosphorylation events, which, in turn, regulate the expression of a set of genes termed immediate-early genes (for a review, see Ref. 2.Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). One such immediate-early gene is ATF3 (for a review, see Ref. 3.Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that ATF3 is induced by many physiological stress signals in animal models (4.Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 5.Yin T. Sandhu G. Wolfgang C.D. Burrier A. Webb R.L. Rigel D.F. Hai T. Whelan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19943-19950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). By in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that the steady-state mRNA level of ATF3 greatly increases upon exposure to a variety of stresses: seizure, toxic chemicals, mechanical injury, ischemia, and ischemia coupled with reperfusion (for a review, see Ref.3.Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, ATF3 is induced in the corresponding tissue that is exposed to the stress signal. Therefore, the induction of ATF3 is a common cellular response to many stress signals: it is neither tissue- nor stress-specific. In addition to animal model systems, ATF3 has also been demonstrated by many investigators to be induced in cultured cells by a variety of treatments. These treatments include the following: (a) growth-stimulating factors such as serum (6.Almendral J.M. Sommer D. MacDonald-Bravo H. Burckhardt J. Perera J. Bravo R. Mol. Cell.

Chen Y. Trent J. Meltzer P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3666-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); and (d) agents known to induce the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase stress signaling pathway such as anisomycin (15.Liang G. Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Chen T.H. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1695-1701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and cycloheximide (11.Weir E. Chen Q. DeFrances M.C. Bell A. Taub R. Zarnegar R. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATF3 is induced by a variety of extracellular signals, and many of them are stress signals. In this context, it is interesting to note that, as indicated by Brown and co-workers (8.Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C.F. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson Jr., J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar), the temporal program of transcription during the response of human fibroblasts to serum appears to be a paradigm for stress response during wound healing rather than cell proliferation. This is because normal cells do not encounter serum (the soluble fraction of clotted blood), but become exposed to serum in the context of a wound. Therefore, the induction of ATF3 by serum in cultured cells may reflect a part of the complex cellular stress response to wounding. Epidermal growth factor (in serum) and fibroblast growth factor (in the extracellular matrix) are also factors that the cells will encounter during wounding; thus, their use in cultured cells may also be viewed as a paradigm for wound healing. In summary, in both animal and cell culture models, ATF3 is induced by many signals that can be classified as stress signals, supporting the idea that ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene. In most cases of ATF3 induction, the expression ofATF3 is immediate (within 2 h) and transient (Refs. 4.Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholarand 16.Hsu J.-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar; for a review, see Ref. 3.Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the mechanism for the transient nature of ATF3 induction is not clear. Two clues prompted us to hypothesize that ATF3 autorepresses its own gene. First, the human ATF3 gene promoter has a consensus ATF1/CRE site (15.Liang G. Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Chen T.H. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1695-1701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Second, ATF3 is a transcriptional repressor (7.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This autorepression hypothesis provides an explanation, at least in part, for the transient nature ofATF3 induction (see “Discussion”). In this report, we present evidence supporting this hypothesis. Significantly, we identified an unexpected ATF3-binding site that is critical for the autorepression of the ATF3 promoter. This site differs from the consensus ATF/CRE site in the key central residues and is immediately downstream from the TATA box. Human cDNAs for ATF1, ATF3, ATF3-(1–100), and ATF4 were inserted into the following vectors for expression: pCG (17.Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) for expression in mammalian cells and pTM1 (18.Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) for expression in the vaccinia system or in the reticulocyte lysate translation system. pATF3-CAT, which contains the human ATF3 promoter (−1850 to +34) linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, referred to as wild-type CAT in this study, was described previously (15.Liang G. Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Chen T.H. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1695-1701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Deletion constructs of the ATF3 promoter were generated using exonuclease III (Life Technologies, Inc.). ΔCRE-CAT, which lacks the consensus ATF/CRE site, was constructed by ligating the −1850 to −119 upstream region of the ATF3promoter to the −82 to +34 downstream region of the ATF3promoter. Δ−20-CAT was constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis using the wild-type CAT construct as a template, resulting in the replacement of the −27 to −11 region by the GAL4 DNA-binding sequence (5′-CGGAGGACAGTACTCGA-3′). ΔBoth-CAT, which contains both mutations described above, was constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis as described above, except that the ΔCRE-CAT construct was used as a template to include the ΔCRE mutation. Maintenance of monolayer HeLa or COS-1 cells, calcium phosphate transfection, and CAT assay were as described previously (7.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pTM1 derivatives encoding ATF1 and ATF3 proteins were transcribed by T7 polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and translated using the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA binding reactions and gel electrophoresis were carried out as described (19.Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of vaccinia virus-expressed ATF3 were as described previously (20.Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), except that 10 mmdithiothreitol was included in the dialysis step. Coomassie Blue staining of the purified fractions showed only bovine serum albumin, which was added to help stabilize the protein (data not shown), indicating that the concentration of the fusion protein or any contaminating proteins was low. The presence of ATF3 was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). DNase I footprinting was carried out as described previously (21.Lee K.A.W. Hai T.Y. SivaRaman L. Thimmappaya B. Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8355-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with histidine-tagged ATF3 (His-ATF3) purified from the vaccinia virus expression system. The amount of His-ATF3 required for each experiment was empirically determined by titration of each batch of protein. The DNA fragment contains the −49 to +8 region of the ATF3promoter. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing was performed as described (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.11-13.13Google Scholar). To test whether ATF3 represses the transcription of its own promoter, we cotransfected into HeLa cells a plasmid expressing ATF3 (pCG-ATF3) with a plasmid containing a CAT reporter driven by a 1.8-kilobase fragment of the human ATF3 promoter. This region has been demonstrated to confer inducibility of the ATF3 promoter by stress signals such as anisomycin (15.Liang G. Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Chen T.H. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1695-1701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that ATF3 repressed the transcription of the ATF3 promoter 10-fold. This repression is dependent on the DNA binding activity of ATF3 because ATF3-(1–100), a truncated form of ATF3 that lacks the basic region-leucine zipper DNA-binding domain (7.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not repress this promoter. In fact, it activated the promoter ∼3-fold. This activation by ATF3-(1–100) is consistent with our previous observation that ATF3, when not bound to DNA, can activate transcription presumably by sequestering inhibitory cofactors away from the promoter (7.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the repression of the ATF3 promoter by ATF3 is not a general characteristic of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors because ATF4, a transcriptional activator (23.Liang G. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24088-24095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), activated the promoter. Therefore, we conclude that ATF3 represses the transcription of its own promoter. To delineate the regions of the ATF3 promoter that are functionally important for its repression by ATF3, we generated a series of deletion constructs from the 5′-end of the promoter by exonuclease III digestion. For the convenience of discussion, we refer to these constructs by the nucleotide numbers of their 5′-deletion points. All constructs have the 3′-end at nucleotide +34. The longest construct, p(−1850), will be referred to below as the wild-type “full-length” construct (wild-type CAT). Surprisingly, ATF3 repressed all of these constructs equally well, irrespective of the presence or absence of the consensus ATF/CRE site at −90 (Fig.2). The observation that ATF3 repressed constructs without the consensus ATF/CRE site (the p(−82) and p(−49) constructs) was quite unexpected because there is no previously identified ATF-binding site in the region downstream from −49. These results imply that the −49 to +34 region contains novel binding site(s) that can mediate the repression by ATF3 (either directly or indirectly). To test this idea, we performed EMSA using DNA fragments containing different regions of theATF3 promoter. ATF3 was synthesized in vitrousing the reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription and translation system; this in vitro synthesized ATF3 bound specifically to a variety of previously defined ATF3-binding sites as demonstrated by competition and supershift experiments (see Fig. 7; see figures in Refs. 4.Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 7.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and 20.Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar; data not shown). Fig.3 A shows a schematic of different ATF3 promoter regions, and Fig. 3 Bshows representative results. Consistent with its ability to repress the p(−82) and p(−49) reporters, ATF3 bound to the −82 to +34 and −49 to +34 fragments efficiently (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 8). ATF1, another member of the ATF/CREB family of proteins, bound to these fragments only weakly (Fig. 3 B,lanes 6 and 9), indicating that the −82 to +34 and −49 to +34 regions have a higher affinity for ATF3 than for ATF1. Control experiments showed that the same amount of ATF1 bound to the consensus ATF/CRE site efficiently (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), excluding the possibility that the inefficient binding is due to the lack of active protein. More important, ATF3 did not bind to the −21 to +34 region of the ATF3 promoter (Fig. 3 B,lane 11), indicating that the −49 to −22 region is necessary for ATF3 binding.Figure 3A previously unidentified ATF3-binding site on the ATF3 promoter. A, shown is a schematic representation of various regions of the ATF3promoter used for EMSA in B. Regions of the promoter are indicated by numbers relative to the transcriptional start site (+1). B, radiolabeled DNA fragments containing the consensus ATF/CRE site or the indicated regions of the ATF3promoter were incubated with non-programmed reticulocyte lysates (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10), lysates programmed to produce ATF3 (lanes 2, 5,8, and 11), or lysates programmed to produce ATF1 (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) for EMSA analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To delineate the precise binding site for ATF3, we first determined the minimal region required for ATF3 binding. We performed exonuclease III deletion from the 3′-end of the −49 to +34 fragment and assayed the binding by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 4, fragment E (−49 to −9) was the smallest fragment in this deletion series that still bound to ATF3. The next fragment, fragment F, did not bind to ATF3. Because the only difference between fragments E and F is that fragment F lacks residues −16 to −9 at the 3′-end, this result indicates that residues −16 to −9 are important for the binding. To confirm this result, we performed DNase I footprint analysis using ATF3 derived from the vaccinia virus expression system. As shown in Fig.5 A, ATF3 protected a 17-base pair region from −26 to −10, supporting the EMSA results described above. Fig. 5 B indicates the binding site defined by DNase I footprinting and the end points of fragments E and F for comparison. Because the residues at both the 5′- and 3′-boundaries of the protected region (−26 to −10) were not efficiently cleaved by DNase I in naked DNA, it is not possible to conclude whether they are protected by ATF3 or not. Therefore, residues −26 to −10 define the minimal region protected by ATF3. For the convenience of discussion, we refer to this region as the −20 site.Figure 5Determination of the novel ATF3-binding site on the ATF3 promoter. A, shown are the results from DNase I footprint analysis of the ATF3promoter. The end-labeled promoter fragment (−49 to +8) was analyzed in the absence (lanes 4 and 7) or presence (lanes 5 and 6) of His-ATF3 (5 μl) purified from the vaccinia virus expression system. Lanes 4 and7 and lanes 5 and 6 are duplicates. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing of the free probe is shown in lanes 1–3. The closed circle indicates the first T residue of the TATA box, and the rectangle flanked bystars indicates the protected region.

Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 4.Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 20.Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar): the consensus ATF/CRE, AP-1, ELAM-1, E4F, and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein/ATF chimeric sites. Although it lacks a clear ATF/CRE consensus sequence (TGACGTCA), close inspection of the sequence revealed some interesting features. First, it resembles the consensus ATF/CRE and AP-1 sites at the border nucleotides, although the center key residues are different (Fig. 6 A). Second, when including the flanking sequence, the −20 site is similar to an ATF/CRE site in the adenoviral E4 promoter (Fig.6 B). Again, the −20 site differs from the E4promoter site in the key center residues. These observations indicate that ATF3 can tolerate variations in the center of the binding sites if the flanking sequences are favorable. Interestingly, this site is immediately downstream from the TATA box, raising the possibility that ATF3 may compete with basal transcription factors for binding to DNA. To compare the affinity of ATF3 for this site versus the consensus ATF/CRE site, we performed a competition experiment by EMSA using the radiolabeled consensus ATF/CRE site as a probe and the unlabeled −20 site or consensus ATF/CRE site as a competitor. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the unlabeled −20 site (lanes 8–14) was less efficient than the consensus ATF/CRE site (lanes 2–7) as a competitor, suggesting that it is a weaker binding site than the consensus site for ATF3. The specificity of the DNA-protein complex in this assay is demonstrated by the following criteria: (a) only reticulocyte lysate programmed to produce ATF3 gave rise to a strong band, whereas non-programmed or vector-programmed lysate did not (Fig.7 A); (b) the complex was shifted by an antiserum against ATF3, but not by a nonspecific antiserum in the supershift experiment (Fig. 7 A); and (c) the complex was competed away by specific competitors (the ATF/CRE and −20 sites), but not by a nonspecific competitor (Fig. 7 B, lanes 15–20). The results from the deletion mapping experiments (Fig. 2) indicated that the −49 to +34 region, which contains the −20 site only, was sufficient to confer repression by ATF3. However, those analyses were carried out using deletion constructs, not in the context of the full-length promoter (−1850 to +34). To better determine the importance of the −20 and consensus ATF/CRE sites, we generated three mutant promoter constructs in the full-length context: 1) ΔCRE, with the consensus ATF/CRE sequence (−118 to −83) deleted; 2) Δ−20, with the novel site replaced by the GAL4 site; and 3) ΔBoth, with both sites mutated as described above. Fig.8 A shows a schematic of the constructs. The replacement of the −20 site by the GAL4 site completely abolished the ability of ATF3 to bind to this region as shown by EMSA (data not shown). We first determined whether each of the ATF3-binding sites is important for the “basal” promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 8 B, both sites were important for the promoter activity because loss of either site led to a significant decrease in the promoter activity. This result suggests that each site is bound by some factors that contribute to the basal activity of the “wild-type” promoter. Deletion of both sites almost completely abolished the promoter activity. To test the importance of these sites for the repression by ATF3, we transfected the mutant promoters with expression constructs encoding ATF3. As shown in Fig. 8 C, ATF3 repressed the wild-type promoter 10-fold, but did not repress the mutant promoters that lack either site. We note that Fig. 2 shows that ATF3 efficiently repressed the p(−82) and p(−49) constructs, which lack the consensus ATF/CRE site (at −90). Those results may appear to contradict the results shown here (Fig. 8). One explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that Fig. 8 is derived from full-length mutant promoters, whereas Fig. 2 is derived from truncated mutant promoters that lack not only the binding sites of interest, but also other regions that may contribute to the proper controls of the promoter. Significantly, ATF3 activated the promoter that lacks both sites. This is consistent with our previous observations that ATF3 activates transcription of promoters without its binding sites, presumably by sequestering inhibitory cofactors away from the promoter (7.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that, in the full-length promoter context, both binding sites are necessary for efficient repression of theATF3 promoter by ATF3; neither site alone works efficiently. Because the mutation at the −20 site is a replacement of the site with the GAL4-binding site, we asked whether the GAL4-ATF3 fusion protein can repress transcription of the mutant promoters. As shown in Fig.8 C, GAL4-ATF3 repressed the Δ−20 promoter, which contains two binding sites for this fusion protein: 1) the GAL4 site at −20 for the GAL4 portion of the fusion protein to bind and 2) the consensus ATF/CRE site at −90 for the ATF3 portion of the fusion protein to bind. The GAL4-ATF3 fusion protein also repressed the ΔBoth promoter, which contains only one binding site (the GAL4 site at −20) for the fusion protein to bind. Consistently, the repression was not as efficient as that on the Δ−20 promoter, which contains two binding sites. These results are consistent with the notion that ATF3 is a transcriptional repressor and that a strong binding site at −20 is sufficient for GAL4-ATF3 to repress the promoter. Previously, we (Ref. 4.Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar; for a review, see Ref. 3.Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K.

A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the induction of ATF3 by stress signals is transient in nature: the mRNA level of ATF3 increases shortly after exposure of cells to stress signals, peaks at around 2 h in most cases, and declines to the basal level after a few hours. In this report, we present evidence indicating that ATF3 can repress its own promoter. This autorepression plays an important role in the prevention of sustained gene expression. However, we note that it by itself cannot explain the transient nature of induction. The induced mRNA must be relatively unstable; otherwise, the mRNA level will stay high even if the synthesis is turned off shortly after induction. Consistently,ATF3 mRNA is unstable, with a half-life of 30 min in HeLa cells (15.Liang G. Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Chen T.H. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1695-1701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of ATF3 mRNA contains several AUUUA sequences (7.Chen B.P.C. Liang G.

A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), a motif that has been demonstrated to destabilize mRNA (for reviews, see Refs. 24.Beelman C.A. Parker R.

In this context, it is interesting to note that autorepression of promoter activity has been described for other genes such as c-fos (26.Sassone-Corsi P. Sisson J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), ICER (27.Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), c-myc (28.Penn L.J.Z. Brooks M.W. Laufer E.M. Land H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and c-rel (29.Hannink M. Temin H.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1843-1850PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, many of these genes are also inducible genes. Therefore, autorepression appears to be a common strategy that nature utilizes to achieve a transient expression of many inducible genes. As described under “Results,” we identified an unexpected ATF3-binding site in its own promoter. This site is necessary for efficient autorepression by ATF3. Two features of this binding site are interesting. First, it differs from the consensus ATF/CRE-binding site in the central key residues. Second, it is immediately downstream from the TATA box. The variation in the binding site indicates the flexibility of ATF3 in binding to DNA; it also underscores the importance of elucidating the spectrum of binding sites for ATF3. At present, it is not clear whether this novel site is a general binding site for all ATF/CREB proteins. Our results suggest that it prefers ATF3 over ATF1. However, a systematic and comprehensive study using other ATF/CREB proteins is needed to address this question. It is intriguing that this binding site is immediately downstream from the TATA box, raising the possibility that ATF3 may repress transcription by competing with basal transcription factors for binding to the promoter. Clearly, this is only a speculation at this point, and much work is required to test this supposition."

By transient transfection assay, we determined that the 227-base pair fragment upstream of the ATG start site contained promoter activity and that the region from +87 to +132 (site C) was responsible for tissue-specific expression. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that site C contained one binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) and two binding sites for HNF3. The mutations at positions +101 and +103, which are considered to be critical in binding HNF1 and HNF3, resulted in a 53% decrease in promoter activity, whereas the mutation of the proximal HNF3 binding site (+115 and +117) reduced promoter activity by 28%. The mutations of these four sites resulted in marked decrease (70%) in promoter activity as well as diminished bindings of HNF1 and HNF3. A to G mutation, which causes conversion of the HNF1 and HNF3 binding sequence to the NF-Y binding site, resulted in a 22% decrease in promoter activity. We identified that both HNF1 and HNF3 function as transcriptional activators in GLUT2 gene expression. Coexpression of the pGL+74 (+74 to +301) construct with the HNF1α and HNF3β expression vectors in NIH 3T3 cells showed the synergistic effect on GLUT2 promoter activity compared with the expression of HNF1α, HNF3β, or a combination of HNF1β and HNF3β. These data suggest that HNF1α and HNF3β may be the most important players in the tissue-specific expression of the human GLUT2 gene.

GLUT2 is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, β-cells of the pancreas, and to a lesser extent in absorptive epithelia of the intestine and kidney (12.Tronche F. Ringeisen F. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). GLUT2 plays an important role in absorbing glucose after meals in hepatocyte (3.Axelrod J.L. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2222-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as well as in insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells (4.Orci L. Ravazzola M. Baetens D. Imnan L. Amhersdt M.

The GLUT2 mRNA level is influenced by the blood glucose level and insulin (5.Chen L. Alam T. Johnson J.H. Hughes S. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The GLUT2 expression between hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells is contradictory in diabetic animal model; GLUT2 expression is increased in hepatocytes, whereas it is decreased in β-cells (7.Rencurel F.

Although the transcriptional regulation of GLUT2 expression under various metabolic states has been studied, the transacting factors regulating the tissue-specific expression of the GLUT2 gene are relatively unknown. So far, Pdx-1, a pancreatic homeodomain transcription factor, has been proposed to regulate the expression of the GLUT2 gene (10.Waeber G. Thompson N. Nicod P. Bonny C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, this factor is not expressed in hepatocytes. Thus, liver-specific transcription factors, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) (11.De Simone V. Cortese R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 960-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12.Tronche F. Ringeisen F. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (13.Kim J.W. Ahn Y.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), HNF3 (14.Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M. Science. 1998; 281: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and HNF4 (15.Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) have been expected to regulate GLUT2 gene expression. None of these transcription factors are found exclusively in hepatocytes; rather, they are all expressed, although to a lesser degree, in other tissues. Thus, the tissue specificity and levels of gene expression depend on the concerted actions of several factors working together. HNF1 is a homeodomain protein that plays a key role in the liver-specific expression of many genes during differentiation and development (16.Miura N. Tanaka K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3731-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). HNF1 is required for the expression of GLUT2 and other liver-specific genes such as albumin, α1-antitrypsin, and fibrinogen (17.Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Courtois G. Morgan J. Campbell L.A. Fourel G. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1987; 238: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 19.Lai E. Darnell J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 427-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HNF1α associates with the highly related HNF1β (vHNF1) to form homo- or heterodimers (20.Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the HNF1α dominant negative form resulted in reduction of GLUT2 gene expression (21.Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of HNF1β resulted in decreased transcription of GLUT2 and was ultimately related to familial type 2 diabetes mellitus (22.Tomura H. Nishigori H. Sho K. Yamagata K. Inoue I. Takeda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12975-12978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The human GLUT2 promoter has a binding site for HNF1 at the −1030 bp region. However, deletion of the HNF1 binding site did not abolish GLUT2 promoter activity mediated by HNF1β (22.Tomura H. Nishigori H. Sho K. Yamagata K. Inoue I. Takeda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12975-12978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, it should be determined whether other cis-elements for HNF1 exist in the human GLUT2 promoter or whether HNF1 indirectly regulates GLUT2 gene expression by other transcription factors. HNF3, a member of the forkhead winged helix family, has been known to have a function in liver and gut development (23.Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). HNF3α, -3β, and -3γ bind to the same DNA sequence with different affinities. It was shown that HNF3 could activate the albumin gene expression by repositioning the nucleosomes in the albumin enhancer (24.McPherson C.E. Shim E.Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 25.Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that human GLUT2 expression was regulated directly by HNF1 and HNF3. HNF1α and HNF3β synergistically activated transcription in NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, we propose that the combined action of the two liver-enriched factors, HNF1α and HNF3β, plays a critical role in the tissue-specific expression of the GLUT2 gene. Furthermore, we showed that the promoter activity of the mutG construct containing the +103A→G mutation, which was found in a Korean non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patient, was in part compensated by the binding of NF-Y instead of HNF1 or HNF3. The promoter region (−294 to +301 bp) of the human GLUT2 gene was cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-basic reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGL-294. Serial deletions from the 5′-end of pGL3-294 were created by polymerase chain reaction. The mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; for sequences, see below). For pGL+74m3, the mutant pGL+74m1 was mutated again with the oligonucleotide m2. The sequences of constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pRSV-HNF1 and pRSV-vHNF1 were gifts from Dr. M. Yaniv. pGem-HNF3α and pGem-HNF3β were provided by Dr. R. H. Costa. Nuclear extracts from liver of male Sprague-Dawley rats or cell lines were prepared as described by Gorski et al. (26.Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) or Dignam et al. (27.Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The extracts were frozen in aliquots and stored at −70 °C. DNA fragments (−294 to +16 bp or +46 to +301 bp) were labeled in each strand and purified as follows. The promoter region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to obtain −294 to +16 and +48 to +301 promoter fragments, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the EcoRV site of pT7Blue (R) vector. The promoter fragments were isolated by double digestion with EcoRI (BamHI) and PstI (HindIII) to obtain 5′-overhanging ends and 3′-overhanging ends. The fragments were labeled using Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP and then purified from agarose gel electrophoresis by a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA-protein binding reactions were performed using 50,000 cpm (approximately 1 ng) of probe per reaction in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 7% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and the indicated amount of nuclear extracts. After a 20-min incubation on ice, 5 μl of DNase I freshly diluted in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mmKCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2, and 7% glycerol was added to the reaction and kept at room temperature for 2 min. Dilution folds of DNase I were ranged from 1:200 to 1:2000 of stock (10 units/μl) depending on the amount of protein present in the reaction. Digestion reactions were stopped by adding 80 μl of a stop solution containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 4 μg of yeast tRNA, and 10 μg of proteinase K. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 45 °C, extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in formamide dye. The samples were resolved in 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. The protected regions were mapped with reference to the migration of Maxam-Gilbert A + G sequencing products (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.78-13.101Google Scholar). Probes for gel shift assays were labeled with32P in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by mixing a 5-fold molar excess of the complementary single-stranded DNAs in 50 mm NaCl, heating to 90 °C for 5 min, and then cooling to room temperature. The oligonucleotides used in these assays were as follows (the mutated nucleotides are underlined): C-1, 5′-GGCAAAGCACTTATTGATTAGATTCCCATC-3′; C-2, 5′-GATTCCCATCAATATTCAGCTGCCGC-3′; mutC, 5′- GGCAAAGCACTTATTGCTTAGATTCCCATC-3′; mutG, 5′- GGCAAAGCACTTATTGTTAGATTCCCATC-3′; m1, 5′- GGCAAAGCACTTATCGCTTAGATTCCCATC-3′; m2, 5′-GATTCCCAGCCATATTCAGCTGCCGC-3′. The oligonucleotides for HNF1 (30.Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), HNF3 (31.Costa R. Grayson D. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), HNF4 (32.Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Tal E. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), and NF-Y (33.Boam D.S.W. Clark A.R. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8285-8296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized, and Oct-1 (5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′) and Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) were purchased from Promega. The labeled probe (50,000 cpm) was combined with nuclear proteins in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The nonspecific competitor, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), was added to each binding reaction. In the supershift assays, anti-HNF1α and/or anti-HNF1β antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the antibody against the B subunit of NF-Y was provided by Dr. R. Mantovani. Antibodies were added to the binding reaction 10 min before the addition of the labeled probe. Binding reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min on ice and resolved on a nondenatured (5% w/v) acrylamide gel (29:1 (w/w) acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. For competition assays, a 50–200-fold molar excess of various unlabeled competitor DNAs was added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the labeled probe. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Cells used in this experiment were maintained as monolayer cultures and grown in appropriate media. Plasmid DNAs were purified on Qiagen Midiprep kit columns (Qiagen) at least twice independently. Cells were plated in six-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 2 ml of medium. After a 20-h attachment period, transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 0.5 μg of each construct of GLUT2 promoter; 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase, with or without 20 ng of HNF1α, HNF1β, HNF3α, and/or HNF3β; and 4 μl of PLUS reagent and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE in 200 μl of OPTI-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium lacking serum were mixed and added to cells. In order to transfect constant amounts of DNA, sample DNAs were supplemented with an appropriate control vector. After 3 h, the medium containing the LipofectAMINE-DNA complex was removed and replaced by appropriate medium (containing serum and antibiotics). Cells were then cultured further for 48 h and harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The lysed cells were centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was collected. Luciferase assays were conducted with 10 μl of cell extracts and 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was determined with 10 μl of cell extract and 190 μl of assay reagent containingO-nitrophenol-β-d-galactopyranoside in a colorimetric assay. Luciferase data were expressed as luciferase activity corrected by β-galactosidase activity in the cell lysate. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated 3–5 times. All transfection studies were performed in 3–5 separate experiments, where triplicate dishes were transfected. The data were represented as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel®(Microsoft). To identify the important region in GLUT2 transcription, a series of sequential 5′-deletions of the GLUT2 294-bp 5′-flanking region contiguous to the promoter and 301-bp 5′-untranslated region were generated and fused to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig.1 A). These constructs were transiently transfected in HIT-T15 cells, which express GLUT2, or NIH 3T3 cells, which do not express GLUT2, and luciferase activity was determined. Luciferase activity for all constructs was very high in HIT-T15 but low in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 A). These differences in the activities indicated that the 5′-flanking region of the GLUT2 promoter might be responsible for tissue-specific expression. In HIT-T15 cells, luciferase activities for the pGL+34 construct remained high (Fig. 1 A). However, deletion down to +73 resulted in a marked increase, whereas further deletion to +188 caused a drastic decrease in luciferase activity. These results indicated the presence of negative and positive regulatory elements in the 5′-untranslated region. To generalize that the 5′-flanking region of human GLUT2 promoter was responsible for tissue-specific expression, we have transfected the reporter constructs to MIN6, HepG2 (GLUT2-expressing) cells and HeLa (GLUT2-nonexpressing) cells (Fig.1 B). As expected, the promoter activity was high in MIN6 and HepG2 cells, whereas HeLa cells showed very low promoter activity. Since the promoter activities remained high down to the transcription start site (Fig. 1 A), two promoter fragments (from −294 to +16 or from +46 to +301) were analyzed. Eight sites were protected with rat liver nuclear extract. These sites were designated as site H (−294/−281), site G (−274/−247), site F (230/−196), site E (−180/−161), site D (−154/−135), site C (+87/+132), site B (+190/+216), and site A (+229/+257) (Fig.2). Computer-based analysis of the sequence revealed several motifs resembling consensus sequences of many known nuclear factors (Fig.3 A). Site C contained three putative transacting factor-binding sites for HNF1 and two HNF3s in reverse orientation. A sequence corresponding to the consensus Oct-1-binding site was also present in site C. Site C and site A contained consensus sequences for HNFs that were mainly expressed in the liver, pancreas, and kidney. The deletion of the promoter region from +74 to +188 bp greatly decreased the promoter activity, suggesting that the factors binding to the footprinting region of site C may act as positive regulators.Figure 3Summary of the consensus sequences in the human GLUT2 promoter.

The +87/+132 region of the human GLUT2 promoter matched well with the −131/−86 region of mouse (34.Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar) and the +492/+541 region of rat (13.Kim J.W. Ahn Y.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A computer search suggested that these regions are potential binding sites for HNFs in these species. Also, it is interesting to note that site B of human GLUT2 promoter region was also conserved both in mouse (34.Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (13.Kim J.W. Ahn Y.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), although the transcription factors binding to the site B are unknown. On the basis of DNase I footprinting and computer-based analysis, we attempted to identify the nuclear factor(s) binding to site C by EMSA. Site C was divided into two overlapping halves, site C-1 and site C-2 (Fig. 4 A). Site C-1 (+87 to +116) included putative HNF1 and HNF3 binding sites. The HNF1 binding site covers the HNF3 binding site. Site C-2 (+107 to +132) included putative HNF3 and Oct-1 consensus sites. In site C, two HNF3 binding sites were inversely oriented. For site C-1, multiple bands were observed by the addition of rat liver nuclear extracts (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2). These bands were specific, since they competed by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide site C-1 (lane 3).Band b was selectively abolished by an oligonucleotide HNF1 site of the l-pyruvate kinase promoter (lane 4). Band e decreased in the presence of an excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to HNF3 sequences in the transthyretin promoter (lane 5). The addition of the HNF1 and HNF3 consensus oligonucleotides abolished bands b ande (lane 6). The unrelated HNF4 oligonucleotide did not affect protein binding (lane 7). Band c represented the complex containing Oct-1 that was competed by Oct-1 consensus oligonucleotide (data not shown). Supershift experiments using anti-HNF1α and/or β antibodies revealed that HNF1α and HNF1β were binding (lanes 8 and 9), although HNF1α is the predominant member of the HNF1 family in hepatocytes (35.Lichtsteiner S. Schibler U. Cell. 1989; 57: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). When both antibodies against HNF1α and HNF1β were used together,band b was completely supershifted (lane 10). Gel retardation using oligonucleotide HNF1 as a probe gave band b, and it was shifted by anti-HNF1α antibody (lanes 12 and13). The identity of band f, the fastest migrating band, was not determined in this study. It's interesting to note that an A to G mutation at +103 in site C-1, which was found in the course of screening GLUT2 promoter mutations of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, resulted in the appearance of band d (lane 11 and Fig. 4 C). To identify the transcription factor binding to this mutated region, we compared this sequence to a number of transcription factor consensus sequences and found that the sequence was identical to the NF-Y consensus sequences. This was confirmed by a cold competitor and NF-Y consensus oligonucleotide (Fig.4 C, lane 3 and lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Site C-1 abolishedbands e and f, but not band d (lane 4). The identity of band d was further confirmed by an anti-NF-Y B subunit antibody (lane 7). HNF3 cold oligonucleotide abolishedband e (lane 8). Gel retardation assay of a site C-2 probe revealed two shifted bands (Fig. 4 D, lane 2). These bands were competed out by an excess of unlabeled probe (lane 3). The lower one had the same mobility as band e in the site C-1 probe and was competed by oligonucleotide HNF3 (lane 5). The slow mobility band (band c) represented a complex containing Oct-1, because it was completely competed out by the consensus sequence for Oct-1 (lane 6). The consensus oligonucleotide for Oct-1 also abolished band d. The unrelated Sp1 oligonucleotide did not compete out any protein binding (lane 7). Next, we determined the effect of mutations on the binding affinity of HNF1, HNF3, and Oct-1 with the promoter. The HNF-binding sites in site C were disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting changes in binding activity were determined (Fig.5). Using oligonucleotide C-1 as a probe, the retarded bands disappeared with a 50-fold molar excess of cold competitors (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and4). The bands b and e were slightly competed out by the addition of a 200-fold molar excess of the unlabeled mutC (A to C mutation at +103) or mutG (A to G mutation at +103) (lanes 5–8). However, the mutant m1 (T to C mutation at +101 and A to G mutation at +103) showed decreased competition when compared with a self-competitor, mutC or mutG, suggesting that the base changes at +101 and +103 in site C-1 may decrease HNF1 and HNF3 binding (lanes 9 and10). In the case of the site C-2 probe, Oct-1 and HNF3 bindings were efficiently competed out by C-2 and partially competed out by C-1, which contained HNF3 and Oct-1 binding sites too (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2–4 and lane 7). Mutant oligonucleotide m2 (T to G mutation at +115 and A to C mutation at +117) could not compete out protein binding even in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of C-2 probe (lanes 5 and6). To correlate the decreased HNF1 and HNF3 binding with GLUT2 promoter activity, we introduced the mutC, mutG, m1, m2, and m3 substitutions at their respective positions in the pGL+74 (+74 to +301) construct. The effects of the mutations within the promoter were tested by transient transfection assay in HIT-T15 cells (Fig.6). The C or G mutation of the +103 base reduced GLUT2 promoter activity to 70 and 78% of wild type pGL+74 expression, respectively. Two-base substitutions of site C-1 (pGL+74m1) resulted in a 53% (p < 0.05) decrease in activity, whereas two-base mutations of site C-2 (pGL+74m2) resulted in a 28% decrease in GLUT2 promoter activity. The pGL+74m3 mutant, in which both site C-1 and C-2 were mutated, reduced transcriptional activity by 70% (p < 0.05). These data showed that the HNF1 and HNF3 binding sites in site C act as positive cis-elements in HIT-T15 cells and that site C-1 is more important than site C-2 in the expression of the GLUT2 gene. Finally, we examined whether these transcription factors were able to transactivate the human GLUT2 gene in a non-HNF-expressing system. As shown in Fig.7, the HNF1 and HNF3 were not expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas they were expressed in HIT-T15 cells as well as in hepatocytes. Therefore, we overexpressed the subtypes of HNF1 and HNF3 alone or in various combinations in NIH 3T3 cells to investigate their effects on GLUT2 gene expression. Except for HNF1β, the subtypes of HNFs showed positive transacting effects on the GLUT2 promoter. HNF1α, HNF3α, and HNF3β resulted in 1.9-, 2.0-, and 3.6-fold increases in promoter activity, respectively. Coexpression of HNF1α and HNF3β proteins showed the highest activation (8.7-fold) of promoter activity, whereas other coexpressions of HNF1α and HNF3α or of HNF1β and HNF3β showed activation effects by 3.1- and 3.4-fold, respectively (Fig. 8).Figure 8Cooperative activation of HNF1α and HNF3β on human GLUT2 promoter activity. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pGL+74 construct and 20 ng of HNF1 and/or HNF3 expression vectors, as indicated. In all cases, equal amounts of DNA (0.64 μg) were transfected into cells by adding control expression vectors devoid of insert DNA. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was measured. Luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity produced by the co-transfected control plasmid, pCMV-β-galactosidase. Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the GLUT2 gene is mainly expressed in liver and pancreatic β-cells, the transcription factors and cis-elements responsible for the tissue-specific expression are largely unknown. PDX-1, a pancreatic homeodomain transcription factor, has been showed to activate the expression of the mouse GLUT2 gene (10.Waeber G. Thompson N. Nicod P. Bonny C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, its expression is not correlated with reduced GLUT2 gene expression in diabetes, which suggests that transacting factors other than PDX-1 may play some roles in GLUT2 gene expression. In this study, we showed that the 5′-untranslated region of the human GLUT2 gene plays a critical role in transcriptional activation, and specifically, site C (+87 to +132) is responsible for tissue-specific expression of the human GLUT2 gene. Also, a serial deletion study revealed that deletion down to the +189 region abolished GLUT2 promoter activity, which suggested that multiple transcription initiation sites exist in this 5′-untranslated region (36.Takeda J. Kayano T. Fukumoto H. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In EMSA, site C-1 (+87 to +116), which contained overlapping HNF3 and HNF1 binding sites, provided the HNF1/probe and HNF3/probe complexes (Fig. 4 B). Competition experiments indicated that HNF1 and HNF3 bound to site C-1 in a mutually exclusive manner, although HNF1 binding seemed to be preferential. In supershift experiments, most of the HNF1 subtypes present in hepatocytes or HIT-T15 cells may be the HNF1α form rather than HNF1β (Fig. 4 B). This result suggests that most of HNF1 acts as HNF1α homodimeric forms in the cells where GLUT2 is mainly expressed. In contrast to hepatocytes or HIT-T15 cells, HNF1β is the predominant form in the kidney (37.Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), where GLUT2 is expressed at a lower level. Thus, it could be assumed that the differential expression of these HNF1 subtypes may be one of the factors regulating tissue-specific GLUT2 expression. We have compared the sequences of site C in human promoter with that of mouse and rat. As shown in Fig. 3 B, these sequences were well conserved in mouse (GTII region; Ref. 34.Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (13.Kim J.W. Ahn Y.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) promoters and may be real HNF1 and HNF3 binding sites. Bonny et al. (34.Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the GTII region might be a cis-element having a stimulatory role on GLUT2. Thus far, transacting factors binding to this region in mice have not been known. Based on our experiment and the homology relationship between human and mouse sequences of the site C and GTII region, it is assumed that HNFs might bind to the GTII region and be working as positive regulators. Transfection studies using HIT-T15, MIN6, HepG2, NIH 3T3, and HeLa cells revealed the differences in promoter activities (Fig. 1,A and B). These activities were well correlated with the status of HNF1 and HNF3 mRNA expression (data not shown). From these observations, it is suggested that GLUT2 promoter could be activated by the expression of HNF1 and HNF3 regardless of the origins or types of cells. It is possible that the subtypes of HNFs may directly or indirectly interact with each other in controlling GLUT2 gene expression, because site C contains both HNF1 and HNF3 binding sites that are located closely together. Previous studies have suggested that an important role of HNF3 could be to cooperate with other factors bound to closely oriented cis-elements (38.Nitsch D. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4494-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39.Espinas M.L. Roux J. Pictet R. Grange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 40.Jackson D.A. Rowader K.E. Stevens K. Jiang C. Milos P. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 41.Braun H. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9821-9828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of the aldolase B gene, HNF3 competitively antagonized HNF1-dependent transactivation (42.Gregori C. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here, we report another type of HNF1 and HNF3 relationship in activating the GLUT2 promoter, in which we assume there is cooperative activation. Recent papers have shown that HNF3 may be involved in the transition of chromatin from an inactive to an active conformation (24.McPherson C.E. Shim E.Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 25.Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the GLUT2 promoter, binding HNF3 to site C-2 may contribute to a higher affinity for HNF1, perhaps by opening the chromatin. Interestingly, in the course of screening non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients who may have possible mutations at the upstream region of the GLUT2 gene, we found A to G mutation in the +103 region, which belongs to site C-1. By this mutation, the consensus sequence for HNF1 and HNF3 is changed to that of NF-Y. Thus, it was expected that this mutation definitely caused a decrease in promoter activity. However, functional assay of this mutant showed only a 22% decrease in the promoter activity, whereas the m1 construct, which has lost its ability to bind HNF1 and HNF3, showed a 50% decrease in the promoter activity (Fig. 6). These results can be explained by assuming that NF-Y binding instead of HNFs binding to site C-1 might compensate the promoter activity, because NF-Y is known to act as a positive transacting factor in many other genes (43.Maity S.N. De Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we identified that the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF1 and HNF3 are two of the main stimulatory trans-acting factors, and they may be responsible for tissue-specific expression of the GLUT2 gene. Furthermore, our results emphasize a new type of functional interplay between HNF1 and HNF3 to drive human GLUT2 gene expression. We thank Dr. M. Yaniv for providing pRSV-HNF1 and pRSV-vHNF1, Dr. R. H. Costa for providing pGem-HNF3α and pGem-HNF3β, Dr. R. Mantovani for providing the antibody against B subunit of NF-Y, and Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki for providing MIN6 beta cells."

The principal nucleotide sugar used for glycosylation in the Golgi of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae is GDP-mannose, whose lumenal transport is mediated by the VRG4 gene product.

We have undertaken a functional analysis of Vrg4p as a model for understanding nucleotide sugar transport in the Golgi. Here, we analyzed epitope-tagged alleles of VRG4. Gel filtration chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the Vrg4 protein forms homodimers with specificity and high affinity. Deletion analyses identified two regions essential for Vrg4p function. Mutant Vrg4 proteins lacking the predicted C-terminal membrane-spanning domain fail to assemble into oligomers (Abe, M., Hashimoto, H., and Yoda, K.

Fusion of the N terminus of Vrg4p to related ER membrane proteins promote their transport to the Golgi, suggesting that sequences in the N terminus supply information for ER export. The dominant negative phenotype resulting from overexpression of truncated Vrg4-ΔN proteins provides strong genetic evidence for homodimer formation in vivo.

These modifications are essential for life and play a variety of important biological roles, from protein folding to the regulation of cell surface properties. The substrates for the carbohydrate modification of both glycoproteins and glycolipids in the Golgi are nucleotide sugars, whose site of synthesis is the cytosol. These molecules must be transported into the Golgi lumen by membrane-bound nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs)1 to be utilized by the glycosyltransferases. The current model for the transport of nucleotide sugars by the NSTs involves a one-for-one exchange reaction, in which the lumenal transport of a nucleotide sugar from the cytoplasm is coupled to the equimolar exit of the corresponding nucleotide monophosphate (2.Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 3.Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nucleotide monophosphate is generated through the action of the glycosyltransferases and nucleoside diphosphatases in the lumen of the Golgi. As a consequence of their role in substrate provision, the NSTs play an indispensable role in glycoconjugate synthesis, best evidenced by the severe phenotype of mutants with defects in Golgi transport of nucleotide sugars (for review, see Refs. 5.Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar and 6.Kawakita M. Ishida N. Miura N. Sun-Wada G.H. Yoshioka S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Many NST activities have been reported, which differ from one another in their substrate specificity. The diversity of glycosylation reactions in the mammalian Golgi requires the transport of many different nucleotide sugars and a correspondingly large number of NSTs. In contrast, the vast majority of carbohydrate modifications in the yeast Golgi are restricted to mannose additions that utilize GDP-mannose as the nucleotide sugar substrate (7.Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lumenal GDP-mannose transport requires the VRG4 gene product (8.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Mutations in this gene lead to a loss of nucleotide sugar transport in vitro and the underglycosylation of glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids in vivo. A deletion of the VRG4 gene is lethal, demonstrating that mannosylation in the Golgi is essential (9.Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Its strong homology to the Leishmania GDP-mannose transporter as well as to a large number of other NSTs (8.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 10.Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) argues that the Vrg4 protein functions as a transporter per say, rather than as a regulator of transport. It is the concerted action of both the glycosyltransferases and the NSTs that ultimately dictate glycoconjugate synthesis. Although much is known about the glycosyltransferases, relatively little is known about the biochemical and molecular basis by which the NSTs transport nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the Golgi. We have undertaken an analysis of the Vrg4 protein to gain a better understanding of NST function. Here data are presented that suggest this protein functions as a homodimer. In addition, deletion analysis of mutant proteins has enabled us to identify a region of the protein that is essential for its exit from the ER and proper Golgi localization but that, when mutated, does not interfere with protein stability or oligomerization. This N-terminal region is distinct from a C-terminal domain required for oligomerization (1.Abe M. Hashimoto H. Yoda K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and protein stability. Like Vrg4 proteins lacking the cytosolic N-terminal domain, these Vrg4ΔCproteins are also retained in the ER (1.Abe M. Hashimoto H. Yoda K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) but probably because they are misfolded and incompletely assembled. When present on a protein that resides in the ER, a sequence homologous to the N terminus of Vrg4p targets the heterologous protein to the Golgi, suggesting that sequences in the N terminus act as a positive ER export signal. Standard yeast media and genetic techniques were used (11.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Hygromycin B sensitivity was tested on yeast extract/peptone/adenine sulfate/dextrose plates (YPAD) supplemented with 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (12.Dean N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). SEY6210 (MATα ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2Δ9) was used as the parental strain for the construction of XGY10 and XGY12, in which the chromosomal alleles of VRG4 or GDA1, respectively, are replaced with those that contain a C-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site fused to a protein A tag (see below). XGY11 was constructed from W303a (MATa ade2–1 ura3–1 his3–11 trp1–1 leu2–3, 112 can1–100) and contains a replacement of the normal VRG4 locus with an allele in whichVRG4 is tagged at the N terminus with a triple HA-TEV tag and is under the control of the GAL1 promoter.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used for complementation analysis of the vrg4–2 allele. XGY13 is a derivative of RSY255 (MATα ura3–52 leu2–211) but contains an HA-tagged allele of VRG4integrated at the ura3–52 locus, driven by theTPI promoter (8.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol.

Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and targeted to the 3′-end of either the VRG4 or GDA1 gene. Similarly, the chromosomal VRG4 allele was tagged at the 5′-end with sequences encoding three copies of the HA epitope and the TEV protease cleavage site. A fragment was amplified by PCR from plasmid pFA6a-His3MX6-PGAL1–3HA (18.Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R.

A TEV protease cleavage site was inserted at the junction between the first methionine of the VRG4 ORF and the HA tag by including DNA sequences encoding this cleavage site sequence directly in the reverse primer used in the PCR amplification.

A HindIII/NsiI fragment containing the VRG4 ORF lacking the stop codon was isolated by PCR and cloned into pSK−P/X myc3, a derivative of Bluescript SK− (Stratagene). pSK−P/X myc3 carries a 172-base pair fragment encoding three tandem copies of the myc epitope, cloned between the PstI andXbaI sites of pBluescript SK−. pSK−VRG4-myc3 encodes Vrg4p fused to three copies of the myc epitope at the C terminus. SK−VRG4-myc3 was used to generate pRHL-myc3, which contains VRG4-myc 3, under the control of its own promoter, on anEcoRI/HindIII fragment in theCEN6/URA3 vector, pRS316 (20.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThisEcoRI/HindIII fragment from pRHL-myc3was cloned into YEplac181 (21.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) to generate YEplac181-RHL-myc3 to allow expression in a 2μ/LEU2 vector and into YEp352 (22.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1993; 2: 163-167Crossref Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) to generate YEp352-RHL-myc3 to allow expression in a 2μ/URA3 vector. Identical constructs, but containing the triple HA tag at the C terminus are pRHL-HA3, YEplac181-RHL-HA3, and YEp352 RHL-HA3. A series of plasmids containing vrg4 alleles with 5′ deletions were constructed by PCR amplification using pSK-RHL HA3 as the template plasmid (8.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each of the deletion constructs shares the same 3′-end, including sequences encoding the C-terminal triple HA-tag. KpnI/SmaI amplified fragments, amplified by PCR, containing deleted 5′ termini ofVRG4 were ligated into the KpnI/PvuII sites of pYEpGAP (23.Gao X.D. Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21450-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to place them under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (TDH3) promoter in a 2μ/URA3 yeast expression plasmid. An ATG sequence in YEpGAP encodes the initiating methionine in each thesevrg4ΔN alleles. 5′ primers for these PCR reactions were designed to amplify from the codon encoding the 16th, 45th, or 79th amino acid of Vrg4p, respectively, to generate the series pYEpGAPΔ15N-HA3, pYEpGAPΔ44N-HA3, and pYEpGAPΔ78N-HA3. Similarly, anEcoRI/SmaI fragment containing the entire wild type VRG4-HA gene was amplified by PCR and ligated into theEcoRI/PvuII sites of YEp352GAP vector to create pYEpGAPVRG4-HA3. An analogous series of plasmids, encoding Vrg4ΔN proteins that were myc-tagged, was derived from the YEpGAPΔN plasmids described above by replacing the 3′-half of eachVRG4 gene with a HpaI/SacI fragment from pRHL-myc3. Each of the BamHI/SacI fragments were inserted into Yeplac181. This series of plasmids encode Vrg4p with N-terminal deletions (Δ15, Δ44, and Δ78) and a C-terminal myc epitope, whose expression is under the control of the TDH3promoter in a 2μ/LEU2 plasmid. To construct plasmids encoding C-terminal Vrg4p deletion mutants, we first made a vector (YEpGAP-N-myc3) containing a fragment encoding three copies of the myc epitope, flanked by anEcoRI/KpnI site and containing an initiating ATG, in YEpGAP. KpnI/SmaI DNA fragments containing deleted 3′ termini of VRG4 were amplified and ligated into the KpnI/PvuII sites of YEpGAP, in-frame and 3′ to the myc3 epitope. The 3′ PCR primers were designed to delete the last 6, 13, or 34 amino acids of Vrg4p to generate YEpGAPΔ6C-myc3, YEpGAPΔ13C-myc3, and YEpGAPΔ34C-myc3. These plasmids encodeVrg4p C-terminal deletions with an N-terminal myc epitope, whose expression is under the control of the TDH3 promoter in a 2μ/URA3plasmid. An HA-tagged allele of the HVG1 gene was created in several steps. First, a fragment containing the HVG1 ORF, lacking the stop codon and flanked by a 5′ HindIII and a 3′NsiI site was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into pSK−P/X HA3 (24.Neiman A.M. Mhaiskar V. Manus V. Galibert F. Dean N. Genetics. 1997; 145: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pSK−HVG1-HA3. This plasmid encodes Hvg1p with the HA3 epitope at the C terminus. AHindIII/NotI fragment from SK−HVG1-HA3 containing HA-taggedHVG1 was cloned into pRS316TPI (9.Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to generate pRS TPI-HVG1-HA3. This places HA-tagged HVG1 under the control of the TPI promoter in a CEN6/URA3yeast expression plasmid. YEpTPI-HVG1-HA3 contains theSalI/SacI fragment from pRS TPI-HVG1-HA3 in pYEp352. To construct a plasmid that encodes Hvg1p with an N-terminal extension homologous to that of Vrg4p, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the stop codon located 60 base pairs upstream the first ATG of the HVG1 ORF to an arginine codon normally found at amino acid 78 of the Vrg4 protein. A HindIII/NsiI fragment containing the entire HVG1 ORF as well as 275 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequences was isolated by PCR and cloned into pSK−P/X HA3 to place the HA3epitope at the 3′-end. This plasmid was used as template DNA for site-directed mutagenesis of HVG1, using the QuikChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers change the T of the stop codon (TGA) to a C to produce an arginine codon (CGA). This generated a 98-amino acid extension in the N terminus of HVG1 ORF to create pSK− mHVG1-HA3. A 1.13-kilobase pairHindIII/NotI fragment from pSK−mHVG1-HA3 was cloned into pRS316TPI to make pRSTPI-mHVG1-HA3. This places the mutated HVG1(mHVG1) under the control of the TPI promoter in a CEN6/URA3 yeast expression plasmid. Similar to YEpTPI-HVG1-HA3, YEpTPI-mHVG1-HA3 was also produced by cloning the SalI/SacI fragment from pRS TPI-mHVG1-HA3 into YEp352. A fragment containing the entire YPL244C ORF was isolated by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into pSK−P/X HA3 to place the HA3 epitope at the 3′-end of Ypl244p. YEpGAPYpl244-HA3 and YEpGAPYpl244Δ41-HA3 were constructed by cloning aKpnI/SmaI fragment (amplified by PCR) into YEpGAP. YEpGAP-VN47Ypl244Δ41-HA3 was constructed by fusing a fragment encoding the N-terminal 47 amino acids of Vrg4p in-frame into the EcoRI/KpnI site of YEpGAPYpl244Δ41-HA3. Exponentially growing yeast cells (A 600: 1–3) were harvested and converted to spheroplasts with lyticase, as described previously (25.Chi J.H. Roos J. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts from 3–4 OD units of cells were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF) containing either 1% digitonin or 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize membrane proteins and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C at 14,000 × g to remove debris. These detergent extracts were used for both FPLC analysis and the co-immunoprecipitation assays described below. For preparation of a membrane fraction, 50 A 600units of cells were spheroplasted using lyticase (25.Chi J.H. Roos J. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The spheroplasts were resuspended in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (0.1 msorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml N-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 100 μg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). Lysis was carried out by Dounce homogenization (25 strokes) on ice, and unbroken cells were removed from the lysate by centrifugation for 5 min in a Microfuge. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer and used for protease protection assays (see below). The HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating 400 μl of the detergent extract (described above) with 200 μl of a hybridoma cell culture supernatants containing the 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA antibody and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation of myc-tagged proteins was done identically, except we used culture supernatants containing the 9E10 monoclonal ant-myc antibody and the incubations were carried out at 4 °C overnight. The protein A-Sepharose beads and associated proteins were centrifuged and washed three times with the same lysis buffer (1% digitonin or 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF). After resuspending in Laemmli's sample buffer and solubilizing at 45 °C for 3 min, immunoprecipitates were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and immunoblotted with anti-HA (Y-11) or anti-myc A-14 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used at a 1:3000 dilution and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole cell protein extracts were prepared by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, as described previously (25.Chi J.H. Roos J. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western immunoblotting using anti-HA or anti-myc antibodies, as described previously (9.Poster J.B. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3837-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants, containing the monoclonal anti-HA antibody, 12CA5, or the monoclonal anti-myc antibody, 9E10, were used at a 1:10 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal IgG against the HA epitope (Y-11) and c-myc epitope (A-14) (Santa Cruz) were used at a 1:2000 dilution. Rabbit anti-mouse IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), used for the detection of the protein A tag, were used at a 1:5000 dilution. Secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, were used at a 1:3000 dilution and were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Indirect immunofluorescence of yeast cells was performed as described previously (8.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Samples were observed with a Zeiss Axioscop and photographed with a Sony DXC-9000 cooled CCD camera. Images were captured using NIH Image software, and all processing was done with Canvas (v.5) (Deneba). Membrane fractions (10 μl) were prepared as described above and were mixed with 20 units of TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a reaction containing (100 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 60 μl. In control reactions, Triton X-100 or zinc sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.5% or 0.1 m, respectively. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. After diluting in SDS loading buffer to stop the reaction, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and further analyzed for proteolysis by immunoblotting with Rabbit anti-mouse IgGs for the detection of the protein A epitope or 12CA5 for the detection of the HA epitope, as described above. 1% Triton X-100 or 1% digitonin cell-free extracts were prepared exactly as described above from yeast expressing the HA-tagged VRG4 allele (pRHL-HA3). 200 μl of extract were fractionated over a gel filtration column (Superose 6 HR 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, containing either 1% Triton X-100 (for Triton extracts) or 1% digitonin (for digitonin extracts), using the FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FPLC was performed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of Vrg4-HAp by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with HA-specific antibodies. For determination of molecular weight, a calibration kit containing proteins that range from 29,000 to 700,000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was also fractionated by FPLC in parallel and detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. Gas1p, which was also used as a molecular weight marker, was detected by Western blotting using anti-Gas1p polyclonal antibodies. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays of detergent-solubilized, epitope-tagged Vrg4 proteins, coincident with other studies (1.Abe M. Hashimoto H. Yoda K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) we found that Vrg4p exists as a multimer. To investigate its oligomeric properties, the molecular weight of the Vrg4p-containing complex was examined by gel filtration chromatography. Detergent extracts prepared from yeast expressing an HA-tagged VRG4 allele were fractionated by FPLC over a Superose 6 column. This tagged allele can complement the hygromycin B sensitivity of a vrg4 mutant, indicating that this epitope does not alter the normal function of Vrg4p (8.Dean N. Zhang Y.B. Poster J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31908-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared under conditions that favored stable Vrg4p-containing oligomeric complexes, assayed by the co-immunoprecipitation of HA- and myc-tagged Vrg4 proteins (e.g. see Fig. 4 and “Experimental Procedures”). Either 1% Triton X-100 or 1% digitonin was used to solubilize proteins, and extracts were fractionated in the same lysis buffer, to maintain stable complexes throughout the procedure. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of Vrg4-HAp by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with HA-specific antibodies. A comparison of the distribution of Vrg4-HAp and molecular weight standards showed that the peak position of Vrg4-HAp elution corresponds to a molecular mass of about 67 kDa (Fig.1), which is about twice the predicted molecular mass of monomeric Vrg4p. The peak of Vrg4p elution was the same whether the fractionation was performed with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 or 1% digitonin (Fig. 1). This result suggested that the size of Vrg4p-containing complex is similar in the presence of both 1% Triton and 1% digitonin. The majority of Vrg4-HAp prepared from digitonin extracts was recovered in a sharp, symmetrical peak. No material of a lower molecular weight could be detected, suggesting that most of the Vrg4p extracted from cells by digitonin exists as a homogenous higher molecular weight species. In contrast, when prepared from Triton extracts, Vrg4p was recovered in a broader peak, with a trailing edge of fractions containing monomeric forms of Vrg4 that co-eluted with lower molecular weight standards. This observation is consistent with our results tha"

Blocking IGF-I signaling by any of the several strategies abolishes or delays the progression of a variety of tumors in animal models. Herein, we demonstrate that in RCC cell lines, IGF-I-mediated signaling is found to be inhibited in the presence of wild type von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppresser gene. Moreover, molecular modeling and biochemical approaches have revealed that β-domain of the VHL gene product by interacting directly with protein kinase Cδ inhibits its association with IGF-IR for downstream signaling. We also demonstrated that RCC has IGF-I-mediated invasive activity where protein kinase Cδ is an important downstream molecule, and this invasiveness can be blocked by wild type VHL.

Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are candidate proliferation markers in renal cell carcinoma because of their overall importance in embryonic and somatic growth, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (9.Osgerby J.C.

Although IGFs are mainly secreted in the liver, its autocrine and paracrine activity is observed in most tissues (13.Simmons J.G. Pucilowska J.B. Lund P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G817-G827PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Manousos O. Souglakos J. Bosetti C. Tzonou A. Chatzidakis V. Trichopoulos D. Adami H.O. Mantzoros C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Most of the biological activities of IGFs are mediated through insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR). The ligand IGF-I triggers an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in the receptor, resulting in its autophosphorylation and the presentation of its substrate binding sites (15.Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar). Substrates containing either the Src homology domain or phosphotyrosine-binding domain can interact with IGF-IR for various downstream signal transduction cascades that ultimately lead to cell proliferation, differentiation, antiapoptosis, and, in pathological conditions, tumor development (16.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 17.Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys.

Also blocking of IGF-IR signaling by any of the several strategies (antisense, dominant negative, or neutralizing antibody against IGF-IR) abolishes or delays the progression of a variety of tumors in animal models (18.Lee C.T.

In addition to its tumorigenic activity, IGF-I also has a role in tumor angiogenesis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that IGF-I promotes the expression of the potent angiogenic factor, vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor in colon cancer (21.Akagi Y. Liu W. Zebrowski B. Xie K. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4008-4014PubMed Google Scholar). Thus any factor that can block IGF-I-mediated downstream signaling can potentially inhibit both tumerogenesis and angiogenesis. Recent studies have shown that protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) plays an important role in IGF-IR-mediated cell proliferation and transformation (22.Li W. Jiang Y.X. Zhang J. Soon L. Flechner L. Kapoor V. Pierce J.H. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5888-5898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It associates with IGF-IR and gets tyrosine phosphorylated, resulting in increased activity. It has also been demonstrated that the ATP-binding mutant of PKCδ can inhibit the transforming ability of IGF-I. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene on chromosome 3p25–26 encodes a tumor suppresser protein of 30 kDa that has multiple functions, such as down-regulating hypoxia-inducible genes (e.g. angiogenic factor-like vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor), regulating cellular ubiquitination machinery and p27 proteins (23.Wizigmann-Voos S.

Germ line mutations in human VHL gene lead to various VHL-associated diseases that predispose to different kinds of tumors such as renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytoma, hemangioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer (27.Gorospe M.

The critical role of VHL in clear cell RCC has been confirmed by demonstrating that more than 70% of the sporadic RCCs have biallelic VHL mutations (30.Gnarra J.R. Glenn G.M. Latif F. Anglard P.

Present studies on VHL indicated that wt-VHL binds with hCUL-2-elongin B/C complex (CBC complex), forming CBCVHL, which may function as E3-type ubiquitin ligase because of their structural similarity with its yeast homologue SCF (31.Lisztwan J.

Thus VHL helps ubiquitination of cellular proteins that are ultimately degraded by proteasome 26 S complex. Our previous studies have shown that the VHL gene product can directly interact with PKCδ (35.Pal S. Claffey K.P. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27509-27512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but here we did not find any decrease in PKCδ level in RCC cells that overexpress wt-VHL. Because PKCδ is an important downstream intermediary of IGF-I signaling cascade (22.Li W. Jiang Y.X. Zhang J. Soon L. Flechner L. Kapoor V. Pierce J.H. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5888-5898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we therefore hypothesized that apart from its role in ubiquitination machinery, VHL could play a significant inhibitory role by blocking the association of PKCδ and IGF-IR. In the present context, we demonstrate that, indeed the wt-VHL gene product inhibits IGF-IR/PKCδ interaction and thus inhibits IGF-I-induced cell proliferation. Moreover, we describe a novel domain of VHL that is responsible for PKCδ interaction and also suggests a new mechanism of VHL tumor suppresser function. Human renal carcinoma cell line (786-O) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (hyClone Laboratories). 786-O clonal cell lines stably transfected with either pRC (Neo cells; cells contain empty vector withneo cassette), pRC-HAVHL (VHL cells; cells expressing wt-VHL) pRC-HAVHL-(1–115), pCMVFLAGVHL, pCMVFLAGVHL (1–143) were grown in complete medium supplemented with G418 (1 mg/ml) (25.Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). 786-Oneo, 786-O HAVHL, and 786-O HAVHL- (1–115) were gifts from W. G. Kaelin. Cells were washed twice with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, 2 mm pepstatin A), incubated for 10 min on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out in antibody excess, using 0.5 mg of total protein either with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (1 μg of IgG) against PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or with mouse monoclonal antibody (1 μg) directed against IGF-IRα subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunocomplexes were captured with protein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad). After three washes with cell lysis buffer, bead-bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Size-separated proteins were transferred (Trans-Blot SD; Bio-Rad) to a nylon membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). For immunodetection, membranes were blocked in washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20) with 4% milk and incubated in washing buffer with either IGF-IRα monoclonal antibody (dilution, 1:1000; stock concentration, 0.2 mg/ml) or anti-VHL monoclonal antibody (dilution, 1:1000; stock concentration, 0.5 mg/ml; PharMingen) or anti-FLAG antibody (dilution, 1:1000; stock concentration, 4.4 mg/ml; Sigma) or PKCδ polyclonal antibody (dilution, 1:1000; stock concentration, 0.2 mg/ml). The secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Ig linked to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) which were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). RCC 786-0 cells were plated in 24-well plates (1 × 103 cells/well) and starved for 16 h in 1 ml of 0.1% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Antibodies against IGF-IR that specifically block the IGF-IR-mediated cell signaling and IgG as a control were added at different concentrations (2 μg or 10 μg/ml) simultaneously. After the incubation [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi) were added directly to cell cultures for 4 h. Wells were then washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were then incubated in 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 15 min, then rinsed twice with 75% ethanol, and solubilized in 0.1 m NaOH for scintillation counting. GlutathioneS-transferase-VHL protein fusions under the control of alac operator (pGEX plasmids: Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were expressed in Escherichia coli. Cell pellets were briefly sonicated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Cleared cell lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer. Beads were then mixed with purified recombinant human PKCδ protein (Panvera) (50 ng) and bovine serum albumin (5 μg) as a carrier in binding buffer. Bound proteins were then resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blotting against anti-PKCδ antibody. Different GST-fused VHL proteins or the peptides were suspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 50 μm ATP (1 μCi) and histone (160 μg/ml) as substrate. Incubation with the enzyme PKCδ (concentration, 0.3 μg/ml) was at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were collected on P-81 filter paper (Whatman Co.). The filters were washed with 0.75% orthophosphoric acid and counted for 32P using liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Peptides (1 mg/ml) were immobilized to ultraLink Iodoacetyl bead (1 ml) (Pierce) according to manufacturer's protocol. 50 μl of peptide bound bead was incubated with recombinant human PKCδ (50 ng) in the buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) for 1 h at 4 °C. After thorough washing with the same buffer, bound PKCδ was eluted from the immobilized peptide bead by the other or same soluble peptides using batch elution method. All the washings and eluted fractions were collected and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. A thin layer of Matrigel solution (0.040 ml of a 8 mg/ml stock solution; Becton Dickinson Labware) was overlaid on the upper surface of the 6.5-mm Transwell chambers (8-μm pore size; CoStar). The Matrigel was allowed to gel by incubating the plates for ∼4 h at room temperature. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (0.6 ml) containing 0.5 μm of IGF-I (Sigma) was then added to the bottom chamber of the transwells. Cells were resuspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a concentration of 2 × 105/ml, and 2 × 104 cells were added to the top well of the transwell chambers. In some experiments, IGF-1R-specific antibodies (1H7, 25 μg/ml) or a nonspecific mouse IgG control (25 μg/ml) were added to the cells and incubated for 1 h before the cells were plated on the top of the transwells. Cells were then incubated for 5 h in the CO2 incubator. The cells that had not invaded through the matrigel were removed from the upper surface using cotton swabs, and the cells that had invaded through the matrigel and entered into the lower surface of the filters were fixed in methanol and then stained with a 0.2% solution of crystal violet in 2% ethanol. Invasion was quantitated by counting using bright field optics with a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a 16-square reticle. The surface area of this grid was determined to be 1 mm2. Three separate fields were counted for each filters. Transient transfection of expression vector (pGEFPC1) containing dominant negative of PKCδ (PKCδ KR; point mutation of lysine 376 to arginine) or the empty vector alone to the 786-O cells was carried out with Effectene reagent (Qiagen) as directed by the manufacturer's protocol. We used a DNA:Effectene ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 25 μl of Effectene reagent in 60-mm dishes and 0.2 μg of DNA to 5 μl of Effectene reagent in each well of 24-well plate. The dominant negative of PKCδ (PKCδ KR) was a generous gift from R. Dutta. By co-immunoprecipation experiments using antibodies against PKCδ, we found that IGF-IR and PKCδ are in the same immunocomplex in two different 786-O clonal cell lines (Neo cells; cells contain empty vector with neo cassette, and without any wt-VHL; and ΔVHL cells; cells express VHL-(1–115)) (25.Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in a 786-O clonal cell line stably transfected with pRC-HAVHL (wt-VHL cells; cells express wild type VHL), this immunocomplex was undetectable (Fig.1 A). These results suggest that in wt-VHL-containing cells, much less IGF-IR is associated with PKCδ as compared with renal cancer cells where wt-VHL is missing. Through immunoblot analysis it appears that the IGF-IR expression level is lower in VHL containing cell as compared with that of other cell lines. But densitometric scanning of the IGF-IR protein level detected in immunoblot suggests that the ratio of IGF-IR expressed in VHL containing cell line to other cell lines (which is 0.7) is significantly higher than that of IGF-IR associated with PKCδ (the ratio is 0.067) in these two cell lines. These data also might imply that VHL can regulate the protein expression level of IGF-IR to some extent. We did not find any difference in the protein level of PKCδ in any of these clonal cell lines, which also indicate that the direct interaction of PKCδ and VHL does not lead to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PKCδ (Fig. 1 A). The immunoblot with anti-VHL antibody (Fig. 1 A) shows the relative expression level of the wild type and ΔVHL in their respective cell lines. To investigate whether the inhibition of IGF-IR signaling can block renal cell proliferation, we utilized IGF-IR antibodies that specifically inhibit IGF-I-mediated cell proliferation. Fig.1 B shows that the blocking antibody indeed inhibited IGF-I-dependent cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in an RCC cell line. The [3H]thymidine incorporation in control (in cpm) was 4707 ± 388; whereas in the presence of 2 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml of anti-IGF-IR antibody, the values were 2726 ± 368 and 448 ± 85, respectively. Therefore, the renal cancer cells have a dependence on IGF-I for their growth, whereas the presence of wt-VHL might be playing an inhibitory role on IGF-IR-mediated cell proliferation. Of importance, it has been described previously that wt-VHL has growth suppressive ability of renal carcinoma cell lines in addition to its antiangiogenic effect (36.Lieubeau-Teillet B. Rak J. Jothy S. Iliopoulos O. Kaelin W. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4957-4962PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Chen F. Kishida T. Duh F.M. Renbaum P. Orcutt M.L. Schmidt L. Zbar B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4804-4807PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest that wt-VHL prevents the association of IGF-IR with PKCδ and thereby inhibits the IGF-IR-mediated signaling pathways. To determine the region of VHL that binds to PKCδ, we used different deletion mutants of GST-fused VHL. It was found that both the N-terminal mutant of VHL, i.e. VHL-(1–115) (ΔVHL) and VHL-(1–122) can bind PKCδ along with wild type (wt-VHL) (Fig.2 A), whereas no interaction was detected with VHL-(1–89), VHL-(120–213) or VHL-(157–189), the latter known to be the elongin-binding domain from the crystal structure (38.Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). So it can be concluded from this experiment that an N-terminal part of VHL outside the amino acid region 1–89 is responsible for binding with PKCδ. The lower panel in Fig.2 A shows the relative expression level of different GST-fused VHL derivatives bound to the bead. During review of this manuscript, a paper by Okuda et al. (46.Okuda H. Hirai S. Takaki Y. Kamada M. Baba M. Sakai N. Kishida T. Kaneko S. Yao M. Ohno S. Shuin T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) also showed that the β-domain of VHL also interacts with atypical PKC isotypes. The PKC family of proteins consists of a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain. The regulatory domain of the various isoenzymes of PKC varies widely in size and sequence and presumably serves to confer specificity to the enzyme. The catalytic domain, on the other hand, is not only highly homologous to each other but also resembles other protein kinases, in particular cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). These kinases are known to be involved in the phosphorylation of Ser or Thr residues of a large number of proteins. In PKA the catalytic domain consists of two lobes that are involved in binding to MgATP and the peptide substrate, respectively (39.Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). A comparison of the phosphorylation sites has shown the importance of basic residues, in particular Arg, flanking the phosphorylated residue. The catalytic activity of protein kinases can be inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors as well as by the regulatory subunit of the kinases themselves. Two different classes of regulatory subunits exist: the RI-subunit class, which is not phosphorylated, and the RII-subunit class, which is autophosphorylated. A comparison of the sequence of the R-subunit of the kinases shows the presence of a segment resembling the substrate but differing in a few residues that are crucial for inhibition (40.Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Hames D.B. Glover D.M. Cyclic AMP-dependent Protein Kinase. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1996Google Scholar). We were unable to detect any phosphorylation of wt-VHL or its mutants by PKCδ (data not shown), suggesting that VHL is not a substrate for PKCδ. The high degree of amino acid sequence similarity of the region (106–112) of VHL with the naturally occurring protein kinase inhibitors, however, suggests that this region has a good potential for being a kinase inhibitor of PKCδ (TableI). To investigate the inhibitory role of VHL on PKCδ, we performed kinase assays for PKCδ using histone as a substrate in the presence of wt-VHL or its different deletion mutants. The inhibitory activity closely followed the results obtained with the PKCδ binding assay; wt-VHL, VHL-(1–115) and VHL-(1–122) inhibited the kinase activity of PKCδ, whereas VHL-(1–89), VHL (120–213) and the elongin binding domain of VHL, VHL-(157–189), did not show any inhibitory activity (Fig. 2 B). These results again suggest that the N-terminal domain of VHL indeed has an important role in the binding and inhibition of PKCδ. On the other hand, it is difficult to understand why the VHL-(1–115) mutant shows binding affinity and kinase inhibitory activity to PKCδ, whereas 786-O cells containing this mutant did not show any reduction in complex formation of IGF-IR with PKCδ.Table IComparison of segment of VHL with the protein kinase inhibitor regionsInhibitorsAmino acid sequencesPHK substrateRQM-SFRLVHL97PYPTLP–PGTGRRIHSYRGH115PKITYADFIASGRTGRRNAI–HDPKCδMNRRGAI–KQPHK substrate means substrate recognition sequence for phosphorylase kinase.

PKI stands for inhibitor sequence for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Molecular modeling studies were carried out to understand the mechanism of inhibition of PKCδ by VHL at the molecular level. Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of VHL in association with Elongin B and C was determined (38.Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The structure of VHL reveals an N-terminal domain at residues 63–154 with a predominantly β-structure and an α-helical domain to residue 204. The interactions of VHL in the complex are through the α-domain, which packs against the helices of Elongin C. The β-domain, on the other hand, makes very little contact with the Elongins. We propose that the segment of VHL that interacts with PKC-δ (residues 105–122) lies in this domain, and we further present a model for this interaction. Although the three-dimensional structure of PKCδ is not known, a molecular model for the catalytic domain can be built by homology modeling with PKA. A sequence alignment of the catalytic domains of PKA and four representative members of the PKC family (α, γ, δ, and ζ) (Table II) shows their high homology particularly within the secondary structural regions. We used the program LOOK from Molecular Applications Group on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation to obtain a preliminary model for PKCδ based on the structure of PKA obtained from the Protein Data Bank (code 1atp). Because of high sequence homology between catalytic domains of PKCδ and PKA (residue identity of 30%), the backbone of the modeled structure follows that of PKA very closely with a low RMS deviation of the Cα atoms (0.34).Table IIAmino acid sequence of the family of PKCs aligned with PKA, using Lasergene from DNASTARIdentical residues are shown in red, and similar residues are in blue.

Open table in a new tab Identical residues are shown in red, and similar residues are in blue. Schematic diagram of the secondary structures of the kinases is also presented here. → represents the β- strand and ▧ represents the α-helix. The x-ray crystal structure of VHL was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (code 1vcb). A scan of the VHL sequence against the PROSITE data base (41.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) identified a 9-residue segment (105TGRRIHSYR113) closely resembling the consensus sequence of the phosphorylation site. As shown in Table I, the tetrapeptide TGRR is also contained in the inhibitor segment that was co-crystallized with PKA. The conformation of the tetrapeptide is very similar in the two structures: a β-turn followed by an extended strand. Our strategy for initial positioning of VHL within the active site of PKCδ was therefore to align the tetrapeptide in VHL with the corresponding segment in the inhibitor peptide. The docking of VHL with PKCδ was carried out using QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstation. Energy minimization of each molecule was carried out independently using CHARMm. The VHL molecule was manually moved, and the atoms of the TGRR segment were superposed on the corresponding atoms of protein kinase inhibitor, PKA. Iterative cycles of energy minimization and manual rotation of the side chain torsion angles were then performed to optimize the interactions between side chains of the two molecules. The final model of VHL (Fig. 2, C and D) shows the N-terminal β-sandwich of VHL fitting snugly into the cleft between the two lobes of PKCδ. The major interactions that stabilize the complex involve the two Arg side chains of the consensus phosphorylation site sequence, with Arg107 making ionic contact with the carboxyl side chains of Asp384, Asp427, and Asp584, whereas Arg108is in close proximity to Asp423, Asp427, Asp463, and Glu490 (Fig. 2 E). In the crystal structure of PKA, the Ala residue at the phosphorylation (P) position of the inhibitor peptide is close enough to the MgATP molecule so that an addition of a hydroxyl group (as in Ser or Thr) would enable it to interact with the γ-phosphate of ATP. In VHL the P position is occupied by His110, whose polar side chain can interact favorably with the phosphate, adding stability to the complex (Fig.2 D). Ser111, on the other hand, points away from PKCδ and MgATP, which explains why it cannot be phosphorylated by PKCδ. The binding experiment and the kinase inhibitory assay suggest that VHL-(1–115) can bind PKCδ and inhibits its activity in vitro. This observation can be explained by the molecular modeling data, which shows that the region 107–111 of VHL is the potential binding site to the catalytic domain of PKCδ. But we also found that VHL-(1–115) cannot block the association of PKCδ and IGF-IR in the 786-O cell line. To answer this anomaly we have synthesized two peptides derived from VHL amino acid sequence: (VHL-(100–118))CTLPPGTGRRIHSYGHLWL and (VHL-(105–123)) CTGRRIHSYRGHLWLFRDAG (additional Cs in the peptides are for coupling purpose with iodoacetyl matrix) and tested their kinase inhibitory function. Both the peptides were found to inhibit the kinase activity of PKCδ (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, VHL-(105–123) showed much greater kinase inhibitory activity compared with VHL-(100–118), although both contain the segment found to be essential for inhibition (106–111), suggesting that the region 115–123 has a distinct role in binding and down-regulating the catalytic activity of PKCδ. As a control experiment, an unrelated 30-amino acid peptide with no sequence similarity (CGKPPAPKPASPKKNIKTRSAQKRTNPKRV) to the two VHL peptides showed very little inhibition at higher concentrations (Fig.3 A). To further confirm the role of the segment 115–123 in substantially increasing the affinity of VHL for PKCδ, we performed in gel competitive binding assays. PKCδ was complexed with each of the VHL fragments 100–118 and 105–123, immobilized to a iodoacetyl bead (Fig.3 B), and eluted out using reciprocal soluble peptides. Fig.3 C shows that PKCδ can be eluted out only from the complex with VHL-(100–118) immobilized to iodoacetyl bead by free VHL-(105–123) peptide. Our studies therefore show the importance of the segment (115–123), and the molecular modeling results suggest that it binds to a region of PKCδ different from the catalytic domain. Interestingly, the VHL 96–122 region is also sufficient for the interaction of VHL with the Sp1 zinc finger domain, and, similarly, amino acids 112–122 are the most critical for binding (47.Cohen H.T. Zhou M. Welsh A.M. Zarghamee S. Scolz H. Mukhopadhyay D. Kishida T. Zbar B. Knebelmann B. Sukhatme V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because the regulatory domain of PKCδ contains cysteine-rich zinc-binding regions, it is possible that VHL binds to this region through the segment 115–123. Because this cysteine-rich region of PKCδ is only few amino acids apart from the autoregulatory domain, conformationally this domain of PKCδ should be very close to the catalytic subunit of the enzyme (42.Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that VHL can bind to these two regions of PKCδ simultaneously, forming a very stable complex and inhibiting its catalytic activity. This tight binding is necessary for its inhibitory activity in vivo because it can compete only with the high affinity substrates for PKCδ. Thus, VHL-(1–115) can bind PKCδ in vitro, but it is competed out with other molecules in the cell because of its lower affinity, as in this case by IGF-IR. To confirm our hypothesis, we generated stable RCC cell lines containing VHL-(1–143) (without Elongin-binding sites but consisting of complete PKCδ-binding domain). Immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that VHL-(1–143)-containing cell lines completely inhibit PKCδ and IGF-IR interaction, and thus VHL-(1–143) functions as that of wt-VHL (Fig. 4). These results confirm that the extra amino acid (115–123) of VHL is important for the functional inhibition of IGF-I-mediated cell signaling. By immunoblot analysis it appears that the IGF-IR expression level is lower in VHL-(1–143) containing cell as compared with that of 786–0-neo cell line. Densitometric scanning of the IGF-IR protein level detected in immunoblot suggests that the ratio of IGF-IR expressed in VHL-(1–143) containing cell line to 786–0-neocell line (which is 0.6) is significantly higher than that of IGF-IR associated with PKCδ (the ratio is 0.06) in these two cell lines. The immunoblot against anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4) shows the relative expression level of the wild type VHL and VHL-(1–143) in their respective cell lines. The invasiveness of tumor cells is one of the important aspects of metastasis. Current findings (44.Long L. Navab R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3243-3247PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Yoshimoto H.

Because IGF-IR is thought to play a major role in growth and development of RCC, we here tested whether RCC can show IGF-IR dependent invasive activity. Matrigel invasion assay clearly indicated that the invasive property of 786-O cells can be inhibited by blocking antibody against IGF-IR (Fig.5 A). Interestingly wild type VHL-containing cells showed poor invasive property compare with that of parental 786-O cells (Fig. 5 B). So our data suggest that VHL, in addition to its inhibitory effect on vascular endothelial growth factor up-regulation and cell proliferation, can also inhibit the IGF-mediated invasiveness of RCC. Again when we transiently transfected dominant negative of PKCδ (PKCδ KR) to 786-O cells, a marked decrease in invasive activity was observed (Fig. 5 C). Taken together these results suggest that the invasive activity of RCC is mediated through IGF-IR signaling where PKCδ is an important downstream molecule in this pathway and can be efficiently blocked by VHL. Various cellular proteins are found to be complexed with VHL protein that include Elongin B/C, Cullin-2(CUL-2), Rbx1, VHL-binding protein-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, etc. (31.Lisztwan J.

DNA ligases catalyze this reaction by coupling condensation to cleavage of a phosphoanhydride bond from either NAD+ or ATP (1.Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The overall reaction favors phosphodiester bond formation. However, a quantitative value for this energy change has never been reported, nor has the standard free energy for the hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond in DNA been determined.T4 DNA ligase, as well as ligases from eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, uses ATP as a co-substrate to catalyze DNA repair (2.Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The DNA ligase catalyzed reaction is reversible, as first demonstrated forEscherichia coli DNA ligase by conversion of a supercoiled circular DNA to a relaxed circular form (3.Modrich P. Lehman I.R. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6370-6372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction scheme for ATP-dependant DNA ligases is illustrated in Scheme FS1.T4 DNA ligase, acting on a circular DNA template, was used in a DNA nicking assay to calculate an equilibrium constant (K eq) for the ligation reaction. From this value, the corresponding standard free energies (ΔG°′) of both the ligation and phosphodiester bond hydrolysis reactions were determined.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREST4 DNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. and had a specific activity of 106 NEB units/mg. ATP was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and AMP was from Sigma. The concentrations of the adenine nucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically using ε259 = 1.54 × 104. Na4P2O7-10 H2O was from Fisher Scientific. Ethidium bromide was from Sigma. All other reagents were ACS certified or better.The two circular plasmid DNAs used were as follows: the 3.5-kb1 pCBZ2 (4.Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the 2.96-kb pBluescript® II KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmids were maintained in E. coli DH5α cells. Cells were grown in Extreme Broth (2% Tryptone, 2% yeast extract, 0.213% KH2PO4, 1.25% K2HPO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glucose) and supercoiled DNA isolated by the method of Clewell and Helinski (5.Clewell D.B.

This method involved concentrating the supercoiled DNA by centrifugation through a cesium chloride density gradient containing ethidium bromide. Residual ethidium bromide was subsequently removed from the DNA preparation by extraction with isobutanol, and the concentration of the DNA was determined as described by Dillon et al. (6.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Linear DNA was formed by digestion with HindIII (New England Biolabs).Ligation reactions were performed in a standard reaction buffer (0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.2 μg of pCBZ2 DNA (0.087 pmol, equivalent to 600 pmol of nucleotides), 100 units (0.1 μg, 1.3 pmol) of T4 DNA ligase, 14 μm ATP, 1 mmNa4P2O7, and varying concentrations of AMP). Standard incubations were for 3 h at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 25 mm EDTA, and 1 μg/μl proteinase K and subsequent incubation for 15 min at 56 °C. Supercoiled DNA was separated from the various relaxed circular and nicked DNA by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (0.04 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) at 100 V for 6 h. Gels were then soaked for 30 min in a solution containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide.DNA was visualized by exposure to 302 nm of light on a transilluminator and photographed using Polaroid type 55 positive-negative film with a Wratten 22A filter. The various DNA forms were quantified by scanning the film on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Ratios of DNA in the open circular and various resealed circular forms were determined using ImageQuant software. Standards were prepared by dilution of a known concentration of pure plasmid DNA to establish accurate DNA quantitation during experimental procedures. The concentration of DNA used in experiments was within the linear range for image densitometry. The conditions for staining the gel and for the photographic exposure and development were kept uniform.RESULTSThe reversible T4 DNA ligase reaction was used to calculate a ΔG°′ value for formation of a DNA phosphodiester bond. The reaction conditions needed to attain equilibrium at 25 °C were first determined (representative photo shown in Fig.1). Reaction mixtures containing a 3.5-kb supercoiled circular DNA (pCBZ2), AMP, PPi (1 mm), and a low concentration of ATP (14 μm) were incubated with 50, 100, or 200 units of ligase for various times up to 16 h, and the products were separated by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Higher values of PPi were avoided to prevent formation of insoluble Mg-PPi complexes, and 14 μm ATP was used as that is the value for theK m for ATP in the ligation reaction (7.Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 5. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1982: 3-29Google Scholar). The ligase activity converted the supercoiled (sc) starting DNA (lane 1) to open circular (oc) DNA and several different topoisomers of resealed circular (rc) DNA (lanes 3–14). The conversion to the alternative DNA forms was completely dependent upon the presence of AMP. DNA from a reaction lacking AMP did not appear modified from the starting material (compare lane 2 with lane 10). This indicates that the formation of alternative DNA forms was the result of the reversible ligation reaction and was not due to contamination by a nuclease or topoisomerase. Treatment of the DNA with ligase in the presence of AMP and PPi, but no added ATP, yielded mainly oc DNA, with some rc DNA appearing because of the formation of ATP in the reverse ligase reaction (lane 15). Linear (lin) DNA was run as a mobility marker (lane 16). The same equilibrium distribution was obtained starting with singly nicked open circular DNA (data not shown) and using a different supercoiled plasmid DNA (data not shown), indicating that equilibrium could be reached from either direction and was substrate-independent.Figure 1Effects of ligase concentrations and incubation times on the distribution of oc and rc forms of pCBZ2 DNA. A representative negative photograph of a gel showing the distribution of pCBZ2 DNA forms from a standard reaction mixture using 1 mm PPi, 15 mm AMP, and 14 μm ATP (lanes 3–14) is shown. Standard reactions were tested with 50 (lanes 3–6), 100 (7–10), and 200 units (11–14) of T4 DNA ligase at 25 °C for 2 (lanes 3, 7, and11), 4 (4, 8, 12), 8 (5, 9, 13), and 16 h (6, 10, 14). The standard reaction conditions were modified as indicated to determine the mobilities of sc, oc, and lin DNA, respectively: untreated DNA (lane 1) or a 16-h incubation with 100 units of T4 DNA ligase in a reaction lacking AMP (lane 2), a 16-h incubation with 100 units of T4 DNA ligase in a reaction lacking ATP (lane 15), and pCBZ2 DNA linearized by digestion with HindIII (lane 16).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With 50 units of ligase there was little change in the nicked/sealed DNA ratio after 4 h (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3–6), and with 100 units there was no difference from 2 to 16 h (Fig. 1, compare lanes 7–10). With 200 units of T4 DNA ligase, the equilibrium shifted to mainly oc DNA (Fig. 1, lanes 11–14) and some lin DNA after 16 h (Fig. 1, lane 14). To avoid complications arising from lin DNA formation, standard reaction conditions were set using 100 units of T4 DNA ligase with an incubation time of 3 h.An additional complication arose when increased concentrations of ligase were utilized. As ligase concentrations increased, the fraction of oc DNA formation systematically increased as well. This result suggests the DNA ligase stabilized a certain fraction of the nicked DNA population. Therefore, an accurate calculation of the standard free energy value for the formation of a phosphodiester bond, the true equilibrium distribution, required using a method that eliminated any contribution from stabilized, nicked DNA. This was done by determining the proportionality constant (C) for the dependence of the ratio of nicked to phosphodiester bonds on the concentration of AMP. This relationship allowed the contribution from this stabilized DNA to be disregarded.The overall reaction catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase is seen in Equation1,ATP+nicked bond↔AMP+PPi+phosphodiester bondEquation 1 for which K eq = [phosphodiester bonds]/[nicked bonds] × [AMP][PPi]/[ATP] or [nicked bonds]/[phosphodiester bonds] = ([PPi]/(K eq × [ATP])) × [AMP]. Therefore, the proportionality constant (C) is defined in Equation 2,C=[PPi]/(Keq×[ATP])Equation 2 and [nicked bonds]/[phosphodiester bonds] = C × [AMP]. By plotting the ratio of nicked/phosphodiester bondsversus the concentration of AMP, C equals the slope of the line, and K eq can be determined.To obtain a ratio of nicked/phosphodiester bonds, pCBZ2 super coiled DNA was treated with 100 units of T4 DNA ligase for 3 h in a reaction mixture containing 1 mmPPi, 14 μm ATP, and AMP concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 mm (representative photo shown in Fig.2). Thes cDNA (lane 1) was completely converted to a mixture of other forms of circular DNA, with the nicked DNA quantity steadily increasing with increasing AMP concentrations (lanes 3–12). The reaction was again dependent upon the addition of AMP and ATP (compare lanes 2and 13, respectively, with lanes 3–12). Linear DNA was run as a control (lane14).Figure 2Equilibrium distribution of oc and rc forms of pCBZ2 DNA as a function of [AMP] concentration. A representative negative photograph of a gel showing the distribution of pCBZ2 DNA forms from a standard reaction mixture using 100 units of T4 DNA ligase, incubated for 3 h at 25 °C, is shown. AMP concentrations were varied from 5 to 50 mm (lanes 3–12). The standard reaction conditions were modified as indicated to determine the mobilities of sc, oc, and lin DNA: untreated DNA (lane 1) or a reaction lacking AMP (lane 2), a reaction containing 5 mm AMP and lacking ATP (lane 13), and pCBZ2 DNA linearized by digestion with HindIII (lane 14).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The photographic negatives from two experiments were analyzed by a densitometer to determine the fraction of DNA molecules that were in the open-circular form (nicked DNA). The ratio of nicked/phosphodiester bonds was quantified at AMP concentrations ranging from 10–50 mm and was calculated as the fraction of molecules with single nicks divided by the total number of phosphodiester bonds per molecule (7.0 × 103 for the pCBZ2 DNA). The plot of the ratio as a function of [AMP] (Fig. 3) yields a straight line with as lope equal to the proportionality constant (C) of 1.94 × 10−3m−1. In principle, the ratio of nicked bonds to phosphodiester bonds should approach zero when the AMP concentration is reduced to zero. However, the results show that this extra polation gave a finite value for the ratio of nicked bonds/phosphodiester bonds, presumably because of formation of some stabilized nicked DNA molecules. With 100 units of T4 DNA ligase (equivalent to 1.3 pmol), that finite value was 15% of the DNA or 0.013 pmol. Because this finite value increased proportionally with the amount of ligase added, the formation of this non-equilibrium complex appeared to involve about 1% of the ligase molecules. Regardless, this effect should not affect the slope (C), which is being used to determineK eq. Using Equation 2,the value of C= 1.94 × 10−3m−1 (from the slope of Fig. 3), and the fixed values of 1.0 mm for [PPi] and 14 μm for [ATP],K eq was calculated to be 3.89 × 104m. This yields a ΔG°′ value, for the ligation reaction, of −6.3 kcal mol−1. This ΔG°′ value relies on the assumption that the concentrations of PPi and ATP are fixed, an assumption based on the fact that the nicked bond concentrations (between 0.4 and 2nm) are several orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations of ATP (14 μm) and PPi (1mm) during the reaction.Figure 3Ratio of nicked bonds to phosphodiester bonds in pCBZ2 DNA as a function of [AMP]. Data was averaged from two independent experiments like that represented by Fig. 2. Ratios of nicked/phosphodiester bonds were calculated for AMP concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mm. The equation for the line was determined by the KaleidoGraph program: nicked/phosphodiester bonds = (2.2 × 10−5) + ((1.84 × 10−4m−1) × [AMP]) withR 2 = 0.96. The nicked/phosphodiester bond ratios and AMP concentrations are expressed in molar units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the ΔG°′ value for hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond, the following derivation was made. The sum of a hydrolysis reaction,ATP+H2O↔AMP+PPiEquation 3 coupled to a condensation reaction,nicked bond↔phosphodiester bond+H2OEquation 4 is thermodynamically equivalent to the ligase reaction represented by Equation 1.The free energy for the T4 DNA ligase reaction (ΔG(1)) is thus the sum of the two component reactions, ΔG(1) = ΔG(3) + ΔG(4), where ΔG(3) and ΔG(4)are the free energy values for Equations 3 and 4, respectively.The standard free energy of ATP hydrolysis to form AMP and PPi, recently re-evaluated by Frey and Arabshahi (8.Frey P.A. Arabshahi A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11307-11310Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), is −10.9 kcal mol−1 in 1 mm Mg2+. Using the formulas of Alberty (9.Alberty R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3290-3302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this value is −11.6 kcal mol−1 in 10 mmMg2+, the concentration of Mg2+ present in these studies. Using this value for ΔG°′(3) and the ΔG°′(1) value for the ligation reaction (−6.3 kcal mol−1, calculated from the K eq), the ΔG°′(4) for phosphodiester bond formation is 5.3 kcal mol−1. The reverse of Equation 4 is the reaction for hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond, and the standard free energy for that reaction is −5.3 kcal mol−1, a thermodynamically favorable value. This value is more negative than the standard energy difference for the hydrolysis of a typical phosphomonoester to yield Pi and an alcohol (∼ −3.3 kcal mol−1) (10.Jencks W.P. Sober H.A. Handbook of Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1970: J181-J186Google Scholar), indicating that an average phosphodiester bond in DNA is less stable than a phosphomonoester bond.DISCUSSIONA cell expends a considerable amount of its energy resources on the synthesis and maintenance of its macromolecules. The formation of peptide, phosphodiester, and glycosidic bonds is thermodynamically unfavorable unless coupled to cleavage of a phosphoanhydride bond in nucleoside triphosphates. Conversely, hydrolysis of the linker bonds in these molecules is energetically favorable. The stability of the phosphodiester bond in DNA is now evident from its standard free energy of hydrolysis, −5.3 kcal mol−1. Comparison of this value with the literature values for the free energy of hydrolysis of glycylglycine and maltose, which are −2.2 kcal mol−1 and −3.7 kcal mol−1, respectively (11.Lehninger A.L. Nelson D. Cox M. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1993: 359-399Google Scholar), indicates that the DNA phosphodiester bond is somewhat less stable than a peptide or glycosidic bond.The equilibrium values of ΔG°′ for DNA ligation and for phosphodiester bond hydrolysis are for randomly nicked DNA and are thus averaged over many sequence contexts. A second DNA with a different sequence was also examined, and it gave nearly identical values, confirming the generality of these average values. Although the DNA molecules were initially supercoiled, the equilibrium was between open circular (nicked) forms of the DNA and the non-supercoiled, resealed topoisomers, which had a roughly Gaussian distribution as expected (12.Depew R.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Thus, the energy of supercoiling is not included in the energies for DNA ligation or phosphodiester bond hydrolysis.The value used for the standard free energy of hydrolysis of ATP to form AMP and PPi was recently re-evaluated by Frey and Arabshahi (8.Frey P.A. Arabshahi A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11307-11310Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The value reported of −10.9 kcal mol−1 is significantly higher than the values of −7.7 to −8.4 kcal mol−1 listed in many biochemistry textbooks. Because the experimental evidence for this re-evaluation is sound, we have adopted it for our determination of the free energy of hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond in DNA. As noted by Frey and Arabshahi (8.Frey P.A. Arabshahi A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11307-11310Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the higher free energy made available by cleavage of the α,β-phosphoanhydride bond of ATP, as compared with the energy from cleavage of the β,γ-phosphoanhydride bond, is put to use in certain metabolic reactions that require a larger chemical driving force. The DNA ligase reaction falls into this class.The DNA polymerase and DNA ligase reactions are similar in that they both entail the formation of a phosphodiester bond at the expense of a phosphoanhydride bond. However, there are some thermodynamically important distinctions between the two reactions. In the polymerization reaction, a new nucleotide is incorporated into DNA, resulting in a loss of conformational mobility and the addition of a negatively charged group to the end of the DNA molecule. Conversely, the T4 DNA ligase repair reaction eliminates a negatively charged group from the site of the lesion. Hence, the polymerization reaction should be less favorable than the repair reaction based solely on ionic charge distribution. Indeed, the equilibrium constant for addition of a nucleotide to DNA in the reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerase is 99 at pH 7.0 and 25 °C (13.Kato T. Goncalves J.M. Houts G.E. Bollum F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2780-2789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a ΔG°′ value of −2.7 kcal mol−1. This value is less favorable than the overall free energy for the T4 DNA ligase reaction of −6.5 kcal mol−1reported here. The repair of a single-strand break in DNA involves synthesis of a phosphodiester bond by condensation of a 5′-phosphoryl group on one nucleotide with a 3′-hydroxyl group on an adjacent nucleotide. DNA ligases catalyze this reaction by coupling condensation to cleavage of a phosphoanhydride bond from either NAD+ or ATP (1.Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The overall reaction favors phosphodiester bond formation. However, a quantitative value for this energy change has never been reported, nor has the standard free energy for the hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond in DNA been determined. T4 DNA ligase, as well as ligases from eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, uses ATP as a co-substrate to catalyze DNA repair (2.Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The DNA ligase catalyzed reaction is reversible, as first demonstrated forEscherichia coli DNA ligase by conversion of a supercoiled circular DNA to a relaxed circular form (3.Modrich P. Lehman I.R. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6370-6372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction scheme for ATP-dependant DNA ligases is illustrated in Scheme FS1. T4 DNA ligase, acting on a circular DNA template, was used in a DNA nicking assay to calculate an equilibrium constant (K eq) for the ligation reaction. From this value, the corresponding standard free energies (ΔG°′) of both the ligation and phosphodiester bond hydrolysis reactions were determined.

Cells were grown in Extreme Broth (2% Tryptone, 2% yeast extract, 0.213% KH2PO4, 1.25% K2HPO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glucose) and supercoiled DNA isolated by the method of Clewell and Helinski (5.Clewell D.B. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) as amended by Dillon et al. (6.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). This method involved concentrating the supercoiled DNA by centrifugation through a cesium chloride density gradient containing ethidium bromide. Residual ethidium bromide was subsequently removed from the DNA preparation by extraction with isobutanol, and the concentration of the DNA was determined as described by Dillon et al. (6.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Linear DNA was formed by digestion with HindIII (New England Biolabs). Ligation reactions were performed in a standard reaction buffer (0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.2 μg of pCBZ2 DNA (0.087 pmol, equivalent to 600 pmol of nucleotides), 100 units (0.1 μg, 1.3 pmol) of T4 DNA ligase, 14 μm ATP, 1 mmNa4P2O7, and varying concentrations of AMP). Standard incubations were for 3 h at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 25 mm EDTA, and 1 μg/μl proteinase K and subsequent incubation for 15 min at 56 °C. Supercoiled DNA was separated from the various relaxed circular and nicked DNA by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (0.04 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) at 100 V for 6 h. Gels were then soaked for 30 min in a solution containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA was visualized by exposure to 302 nm of light on a transilluminator and photographed using Polaroid type 55 positive-negative film with a Wratten 22A filter. The various DNA forms were quantified by scanning the film on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Ratios of DNA in the open circular and various resealed circular forms were determined using ImageQuant software. Standards were prepared by dilution of a known concentration of pure plasmid DNA to establish accurate DNA quantitation during experimental procedures. The concentration of DNA used in experiments was within the linear range for image densitometry. The conditions for staining the gel and for the photographic exposure and development were kept uniform. RESULTSThe reversible T4 DNA ligase reaction was used to calculate a ΔG°′ value for formation of a DNA phosphodiester bond. The reaction conditions needed to attain equilibrium at 25 °C were first determined (representative photo shown in Fig.1). Reaction mixtures containing a 3.5-kb supercoiled circular DNA (pCBZ2), AMP, PPi (1 mm), and a low concentration of ATP (14 μm) were incubated with 50, 100, or 200 units of ligase for various times up to 16 h, and the products were separated by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Higher values of PPi were avoided to prevent formation of insoluble Mg-PPi complexes, and 14 μm ATP was used as that is the value for theK m for ATP in the ligation reaction (7.Engler M.J. Richardson C.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 5. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1982: 3-29Google Scholar). The ligase activity converted the supercoiled (sc) starting DNA (lane 1) to open circular (oc) DNA and several different topoisomers of resealed circular (rc) DNA (lanes 3–14). The conversion to the alternative DNA forms was completely dependent upon the presence of AMP. DNA from a reaction lacking AMP did not appear modified from the starting material (compare lane 2 with lane 10). This indicates that the formation of alternative DN"

The ligand sensitivity of ZK159222, in facilitating complex formation between 1α,25-(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) on a 1α,25-(OH)2D3 response element (VDRE), was approximately 7-fold lower when compared with 1α,25-(OH)2D3. However, ZK159222 was not able to promote a ligand-dependent interaction of the VDR with the coactivator proteins SRC-1, TIF2, and RAC3, neither in solution nor in a complex with RXR on DNA. Functional analysis in HeLa and COS-7 cells demonstrated a 10–100-fold lower ligand sensitivity for ZK159222 than for 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and, most interestingly, a potency that was drastically reduced compared with 1α,25-(OH)2D3. A cotreatment of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 with a 100-fold higher concentration of ZK159222 resulted in a prominent antagonistic effect both in functional in vivo and in in vitroassays. These data suggest that the antagonistic action of ZK159222 is due to a lack of ligand-induced interaction of the VDR with coactivators with a parallel ligand sensitivity, which is sufficient for competition with the natural hormone for VDR binding.

Krisinger J. Darwish H. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: S2-S8Google Scholar), but the nuclear hormone also plays a role in controlling cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (2.Walters M.R. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 719-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various analogues of 1α,25-(OH)2D3, which mainly contain modifications of the side chain, have been developed with the goal to improve the biological profile of the natural hormone for a potential therapeutic application (3.Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic effects of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and its analogues are principally mediated through the 1α,25-(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) (4.Carlberg C. Polly P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1998; 8: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which is a member of the nuclear receptor transcription factor superfamily (5.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

VDR binds as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (6.Carlberg C. Endocrine. 1996; 4: 91-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to specific sequences in promoter regions of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 target genes, referred to as 1α,25-(OH)2D3 response elements (VDREs) (7.Carlberg C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Simple VDREs consist of two hexameric nuclear receptor binding sites, which are commonly arranged as a direct repeat with 3 spacing nucleotides (DR3-type VDREs) (4.Carlberg C. Polly P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1998; 8: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The VDR consists of several functional domains, which includes the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). The LBD of the VDR is formed by 12 α-helical structures, of which the last one, helix 12, contains a short transactivation function 2 (AF-2) domain. A critical step in 1α,25-(OH)2D3 signaling is the specific ligand-triggered induction of a conformational change within the LBD of the VDR. This conformational change induces the dissociation of corepressors, such as NCoR (8.Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K.

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms of the antagonistic action of the 26,23-lactone analogue have been explained by reduced VDR-RXR heterodimer complex formation (26.Ozono K. Saiti M. Miura D.

In this study, a 25-carboxylic ester analogue of 1α,25-(OH)2D3, ZK159222, was characterized as a novel type of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 antagonist. ZK159222 was not able to promote a ligand-dependent interaction of the VDR with coactivator proteins of the p160 family neither in solution nor in a complex with RXR on DNA. Moreover, functional in vivo assays in HeLa, COS-7, and MCF-7 cells demonstrated that a cotreatment of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 with a 100-fold higher concentration of ZK159222 showed a prominent antagonistic effect, which was confirmed with in vitro coactivator interaction assays. 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222 (butyl-(5Z,7E,22E)-(1S,3R,24R)-1,3,24-trihydroxy-26,27-cyclo-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10(19),22-tetraene-25-carboxylate) (22.Wiesinger H.

These constructs are also suitable for T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription/translation of the respective cDNAs. Four copies of the DR3-type VDRE from the rat atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene promoter (29.Kahlen J.-P. Carlberg C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The DBD of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (amino acids 1–147) was fused with the cDNA of the human VDR LBD (amino acids 109–427). For the mammalian one-hybrid assays the luciferase reporter gene was driven by three copies of the GAL4 binding site fused to the tk promoter (8.Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J.

In vitro translated, 35S-labeled VDR protein (2.5 μl) alone or together with 2.5 μl in vitrotranslated RXR and 1 ng of unlabeled rat ANF DR3-type VDRE were incubated with ligand for 15 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/μl poly(dI-C), and 5% glycerol). The buffer was adjusted to 150 mm of monovalent cations by addition of KCl. Trypsin (Promega, final concentration 8.3 ng/μl) was then added, and the mixtures were further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The digestion reactions were stopped by adding 25 μl of protein gel loading buffer (0.25 m Tris (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue). The samples were denatured at 85 °C for 3 min and electrophoresed through a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and exposed to a Fuji MP2040S imager screen. The individual protease-sensitive VDR fragments were quantified on a Fuji FLA2000 reader (Tokyo, Japan) using Image Gauge software (Raytest, Sprockhövel, Germany). In vitro translated VDR-RXR heterodimers were incubated with graded or saturating concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222 for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer. The buffer had been adjusted to 150 mm by addition of KCl. For supershift assays, approximately 3 μg of bacterially expressed GST-SRC-1596–790, GST-TIF2646–926, or GST-RAC3673–1106 fusion protein were included in the incubation. Approximately 1 ng of the 32P-labeled DR3-type VDRE from the rat ANF promoter (50,000 cpm) was added to the protein-ligand mixture, and incubation was continued for 20 min. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved through 6 or 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.3)) and were quantified by phosphorimaging. GST pull-down assays were performed by coincubation of a 50% GST-TIF2646–926-Sepharose bead slurry with in vitro translated 35S-labeled VDR and indicated concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222 in PPI buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 200 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at 30 °C. GST fusion protein-Sepharose slurries were routinely preblocked in PPI buffer containing bovine serum albumin (1 μg/μl) prior to use in pull-down assays. In vitrotranslated proteins, that were not bound to GST fusion proteins, were washed away with PPI buffer. GST fusion protein bound VDR was detected by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantified by phosphorimaging. COS-7 SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cells or MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were seeded into six-well plates (105 cells/ml) and grown overnight in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. Liposomes were formed by incubating 1 μg of the reporter plasmid, 1 μg of each pSG5-based receptor expression vectors for VDR and RXR, and 1 μg of the reference plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 15 μgN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethylsulfate (DOTAP, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl. After dilution with 900 μl of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the liposomes were added to the cells. Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 30% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum (500 μl) was added 4 h after transfection. At this time, graded concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 or ZK159222 were also added. HeLa human cervix carcinoma cells were cultured, seeded, and transfected under the same conditions as COS-7 and MCF-7 cells, but for the mammalian one-hybrid assay, the expression vector for the GAL4DBDVDRLBD fusion protein and a GAL4 binding site-driven luciferase reporter gene construct were used in transfections. The cells were lysed 16 h after onset of stimulation using the reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) for both types of assays and the constant light signal luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as recommended by the supplier (Roche Diagnostics). The luciferase activities were normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity, and induction factors were calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity of ligand-stimulated cells to that of solvent controls. Conformations of the VDR, bound by saturating concentrations (10 μm) of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 or the 25-carboxylic ester analogue ZK159222 (for structures see Fig.1), were analyzed by limited protease digestion assays, which provided two digestion products, c1LPD and c3LPD, for 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and an additional digestion product, c2LPD, for ZK159222 (Fig.2 A). The VDR fragments c1LPD, c2LPD, and c3LPD have been previously characterized to contain major parts of the LBD and its carboxyl-terminal truncations, which represent the functional VDR conformations 1, 2, and 3, respectively (30.Nayeri S.

With monomeric VDR, 1α,25-(OH)2D3 stabilized 50% and ZK159222 33% of all VDR molecules in c1LPD, which is known to be the most ligand-sensitive VDR conformation (30.Nayeri S. Kahlen J.-P. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4513-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the presence of RXR and DNA, i.e. when VDR-RXR heterodimers are formed on a specific VDRE, the amount of c1LPD stabilization is increased to 75 and 48% of VDR input, respectively. The amount of VDR molecules that were in conformations c2LPD and c3LPD did not exceed 20%, both under DNA-independent and DNA-dependent conditions. However, due to the fact that ZK159222 stabilized three VDR conformations, the total amount of ligand-stabilized VDR molecules was equal for both compounds at saturating ligand concentrations. Ligand-dependent gel shift assays were performed with in vitro translated VDR-RXR heterodimers bound to the rat ANF DR3-type VDRE and graded concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 or ZK159222 (Fig. 2 B). A comparable intensity (approximately 30% shifted probe) of dose-dependent VDR-RXR heterodimer complex formation on DNA was observed for both compounds providing EC50 (half-maximal activation) values of 0.14 and 1.0 nm for 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222, respectively. For comparison, traditional ligand binding assays using 3H-labeled 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and purified VDR from pig intestine provided K d-values of 0.45 and 0.61 nm for 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222, respectively (data not shown). Taken together, this series ofin vitro experiments characterize ZK159222 as an VDR agonist that is 2–10-times less sensitive than the natural hormone 1α,25-(OH)2D3. GST pull-down assays were performed with bacterial produced GST-TIF646–926 fusion protein (containing the nuclear receptor interaction domains) and in vitro translated35S-labeled VDR protein at a saturating concentration (10 μm) of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222 (Fig. 3 A). 1α,25-(OH)2D3 mediated a precipitation of up to 18% of VDR input, whereas in the presence of ZK159222 the precipitation of VDR protein was not significantly higher than solvent control. Gel shift assays were performed with in vitrotranslated VDR-RXR heterodimers bound to the rat ANF DR3-type VDRE in the presence of approximately 3 μg of GST-SRC-1596–790, GST-TIF2646–926, or GST-RAC3673–1106 fusion proteins and saturating concentrations (10 μm) of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222 (Fig.3 B). In the presence of 1α,25-(OH)2D3, VDR-RXR-VDRE coactivator complexes were observed with all three p160 family members, whereas in the presence of ZK159222 a supershift could not be detected with any of the tested coactivators. The quantification of the relative intensities of these VDR-RXR and VDR-RXR coactivator complexes indicated that ZK159222 stabilized the same amount of VDR-RXR heterodimers compared with 1α,25-(OH)2D3, but these heterodimers did not demonstrate interaction with coactivator proteins. Mammalian one-hybrid assays were performed in HeLa cells that were transiently transfected with an expression vector for a fusion protein containing the DBD of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 and the LBD of the VDR together with a reporter gene construct containing a GAL4 binding site-driven luciferase gene in the presence of graded concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222 (Fig. 4 A). In this assay system, 1α,25-(OH)2D3 induced reporter gene activity in a typical dose response (potency of 14-fold induction and ligand sensitivity, i.e. EC50 value, of 1.0 nm), whereas ZK159222 showed very weak potency (2-fold induction at saturating concentrations) and low ligand sensitivity (EC50 value of 120 nm). Reporter gene assays in COS-7 cells, that were transiently transfected with expression vectors for VDR and RXR and a DR3-type VDRE-driven luciferase reporter construct, showed similar results (Fig. 4 B). 1α,25-(OH)2D3 provided a typical dose response with an EC50 value of 1.7 nm, whereas in this assay system, ZK159222 also showed clearly weaker potency (2-fold induction at saturating concentrations) and lower ligand sensitivity (EC50 value of 10 nm). Antagonistic effects of ZK159222 on 1α,25-(OH)2D3 signaling were tested in vivo and in vitro by applying a saturating concentration of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 with a up to 1000-fold higher concentration of ZK159222. In reporter gene assays in COS-7 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5,A and C) and in mammalian one-hybrid assays in HeLa cells (Fig. 5 B), 10 nm1α,25-(OH)2D3 provided induction of luciferase reporter gene activity between 8- and 43-fold, whereas 1 μm ZK159222 provided less than 20% of this activity (2–8-fold induction). Interestingly, a combined treatment of 10 nm 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and 1 μm ZK159222 resulted in only 27–40% of the activity of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 alone, i.e. in an obvious antagonistic effect of ZK159222 in vivo. Moreover, the remaining reporter gene activity that was obtained by a combined treatment of 10 nm 1α,25-(OH)2D3with 1 μm ZK159222 is close to the partial agonistic activity of 1 μm ZK159222. The titration of ZK159222 at constant concentrations of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nm) indicated that a half-maximal antagonistic effect was obtained at 20–30 nm ZK159222, i.e. at concentrations two to three times higher than that of 1α,25-(OH)2D3. This fits well with the difference in EC50 and K d values of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and ZK159222 (compare Fig.2 B). In GST pull-down assays (Fig. 5 D) and supershift assays (Fig. 5 E) with GST-TIF2646–926, 100 nm1α,25-(OH)2D3 mediated precipitation of up to 18% of in vitro translated 35S-labeled VDR protein and 10 nm 1α,25-(OH)2D3provided a shift of nearly all VDRE-complexed VDR-RXR heterodimers into complexes with TIF2, respectively. In contrast, 10 μmZK159222 did not provide a significant precipitation of VDR or a supershift of DNA-complexed VDR-RXR heterodimers (as already shown in Fig. 3, A and B). However, the combination of 100 nm 1α,25-(OH)2D3 with 10 μm ZK159222 provided a reduction of VDR precipitation by 40% (Fig. 5 D). Moreover, a combination of 10 nm1α,25-(OH)2D3 with 10 μmZK159222 resulted in an equal amount of VDR-RXR-VDRE and VDR-RXR-VDRE-TIF2 complexes (Fig. 5 E). The supershift experiments (Fig. 5 E) have been performed at different doses of ZK159222 and indicated the dose dependence of the antagonistic action of ZK159222. 1α,25-(OH)2D3-mediated transactivation is a multistep event, in which the binding of VDR-RXR heterodimers to a VDRE is one of the first critical steps. Interestingly, on this level the 1α,25-(OH)2D3 analogue that was characterized in this study, ZK159222, displayed the profile of a weak VDR agonists that requires an approximate 7-fold higher concentration than of the natural hormone 1α,25-(OH)2D3 to stabilize VDR-RXR heterodimer complex formation on a DR3-type VDRE. ZK159222 was found to belong to the category of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 analogues that stabilize an additional third functional VDR conformation, which has also been described for some agonistic 20-epi analogues (32.Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10551-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 34.Nayeri S. Mathiasen I.S. Binderup L. Carlberg C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, under the conditions used in this study agonistic analogues were not found to stabilize conformation c2LPD (data not shown). Like 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and most other potent VDR agonists, and in particular in DNA-bound heterodimeric complexes with RXR, ZK159222 also stabilizes the high affinity VDR conformation c1LPD most prominently (30.Nayeri S. Kahlen J.-P. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4513-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33.Liu Y.-Y. Collins E.D. Norman A.W. Peleg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3336-3345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This study confirmed previous reports that VDR interacts in a ligand-dependent fashion with the three members of the p160 family, SRC-1, TIF2, or RAC3 (35.Herdick M. Bury Y. Quack M. Uskokovic M. Polly P. Carlberg C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Gill R.K. Atkins L.M. Hollis B.W. Bell N.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 1α,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated this VDR-coactivator interaction, whereas ZK159222 was found to be unable to induce an interaction between VDR and SRC-1, TIF2, and RAC3, neither with VDR monomers in solution nor with heterodimeric complexes with RXR on DNA. This lack of interaction with coactivators appears to be the reason why the inducibility of ZK159222-stimulated reporter gene activity demonstrated to be very low in comparison to that of the natural hormone 1α,25-(OH)2D3. This effect could be observed in mammalian one-hybrid assays in HeLa cells, in VDRE-driven reporter gene assays performed in COS-7 cells that overexpressed VDR- and RXR-overexpressing COS-7 model system, as well as in the natural 1α,25-(OH)2D3 target cell line MCF-7. A combination of a saturating 1α,25-(OH)2D3concentration with a 100-fold higher concentration of ZK159222 resulted in a significant antagonistic effect in all these in vitroand in vivo assay systems: the amount of 1α,25-(OH)2D3-induced VDR-coactivator interaction in solution and on DNA was found to be reduced as well as that of 1α,25-(OH)2D3-induced reporter gene activity. A 100-fold higher concentration of ZK159222 appears to be sufficient for effectively competing with the natural hormone in occupying the majority of the VDR molecules in these different experimental systems. This would then result in the observed reduced interaction with coactivators and the subsequent decrease of ligand-induced reporter gene activity. The antagonistic mechanism described here for ZK159222 is also likely to apply to other VDR ligands. If a compound, which does not necessarily have to be a classical 1α,25-(OH)2D3 analogue, binds with an affinity to the ligand binding cleft of the VDR that is in the order of the EC50 value of the VDR-1α,25-(OH)2D3 interaction,i.e. 0.1 nm, but in parallel does not enable the receptor to interact with coactivators, it may act as an antagonist of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 signaling. This suggests that the transactivation potency of a VDR-binding ligand, i.e.its fold induction, should be taken in relation to its interaction sensitivity with the VDR, i.e. its EC50 value. Structural relatives of ZK159222 also show a low potency in reporter gene assays, but their affinity for the VDR is even lower than that of ZK159222, such that a 1000-fold or higher excess of these compounds is needed to obtain an antagonistic effect (data not shown). Moreover, tissue-specific differences in coactivator expression as well as in analogue metabolism may cause tissue-specific differences in the extent of the antagonistic effects of VDR ligands. However, there may also be other mechanisms of antagonism in 1α,25-(OH)2D3 signaling, e.g. a prevention of VDR-RXR complex formation on DNA, as suggested for the 26,23-lactone 1α,25-(OH)2D3 analogue TEI-9647 (26.Ozono K. Saiti M. Miura D. Michigami T. Nakajima S. Ishizuka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32376-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The AF-2 domain in helix 12 was described to be repositioned after ligand binding to the LBD (37.Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and provides an interface for nuclear receptors together with amino acids of helices 3 and 5 for the binding of coactivators (38.Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.A. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). A comparison of the crystal structure of agonist- and antagonist-bound ER suggests that antagonists block AF-2 function by disrupting the topography of the AF-2 surface (24.Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). In analogy to this, one would expect that ZK159222 also stabilizes a VDR conformation that differs from the agonistic conformation c1LPD and in which the AF-2 is functionally blocked (25.Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). This could be c2LPD, which is stabilized only by ZK159222 and its antagonistic relatives and not by agonists, if physiological ionic strength conditions are used (data not shown). One could speculate that the rather long side chain of ZK159222 results in an alternative packing arrangement of ligand-binding pocket residues. This may then result in a conformation of the LBD, where helix 12 reaches the static region of the AF-2 surface, which was shown in the case of ER to mimic bound coactivator (25.Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the 25-carboxylic ester 1α,25-(OH)2D3 analogue ZK159222 has been characterized in this report as a novel type of VDR antagonist with a partial agonistic character, where the mechanism of antagonistic action is based mainly on a lack of induction of VDR-coactivator interaction.

Initially discovered in an Archaeon (see Refs. 1.Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar and 2.Duguet M. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1995: 85-114Google Scholar for a review), it has been further isolated from a variety of archaea and bacteria and has been recognized as a marker of hyperthermophiles, independently of the domain of life to which it belongs (3.Collin R.G. Morgan H.W. Musgrave D.R. Daniel R.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 55: 235-240Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4.Andera L. Mikulik K. Savelyeva N.D. FEMS Microbiol.

The basic activity performed in vitro by this enzyme is the production of positive supercoils in a closed circular DNA, a thermodynamically unfavored reaction that is driven by ATP. This activity provided possible explanations for the specific presence of reverse gyrase in hyperthermophiles, since positive supercoiling may stabilize the double helix at high temperatures, preventing local opening of the helix or allowing duplex “renaturation” after the passage of a transcription complex (6.Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional “raison d'être” of reverse gyrase could be the use of positive supercoiling to assemble chromatin-like structures in some hyperthermophiles (7.Forterre P. Charbonnier F. Marguet E. Harper F. Henkes G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1992; 58: 99-112PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a similar activity was proposed to be present in eukaryotes (8.Gangloff S. McDonald J.-P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), where it could be involved in disrupting nucleosomal structures or in destabilizing illegitimate recombination intermediates (9.Duguet M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus giving reverse gyrase a more universal status. A crucial question that could shed some light on the function of reverse gyrase remains unanswered. What is the mechanism by which this sophisticated enzyme is able to catalyze a positive supercoiling reaction? Several years ago, two unexpected results somewhat clarified the problem. One was the finding that reverse gyrase, despite its unique ATP dependence, was a type I topoisomerase, transiently bound to the 5′ end of the cleaved strand (10.Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as the other members of the type I-5′ family (11.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). The second was that stoichiometric binding of reverse gyrase to a form II DNA in the absence of ATP decreased the linking number of DNA after closure by a ligase, a property that was interpreted as DNA unwinding and was reminiscent of helicases (10.Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An additional clue to the reverse gyrase mechanism was later provided by the cloning and sequencing of the enzyme from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius in our laboratory (12.Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. de La Tour C.B. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The sequence that came out was clearly divided into two halves. The N-terminal half exhibited the usual signatures of a family of DNA/RNA helicases, and the C-terminal half was similar to the type I-5′ topoisomerases, confirming the previous results. All of the other recently sequenced reverse gyrase genes also contain the signatures of these two protein families, although the gene structure can be somewhat different (13.Krah R. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13986-13990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based on this structure in two domains, we proposed a “dynamic” model for the mechanism in which we assumed that the N-terminal domain had an ATP-dependent helicase activity; helix tracking by this domain was supposed to produce a wave of positive supercoiling ahead of reverse gyrase and of negative supercoiling behind (14.Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Specific relaxation of these negative supercoils by the topoisomerase I domain was supposed to finally produce net positive supercoiling (12.Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. de La Tour C.B. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This model supported the idea that in eukaryotes the function of reverse gyrase could be fulfilled by the association of a helicase and a topoisomerase (9.Duguet M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent results (15.Kovalsky O. Kozyavkin S.A. Slesarev A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2801-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16.Jaxel C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) on the sequence specificity of reverse gyrase are difficult to reconcile with the above model, which implies that the protein moves rapidly along the DNA. Moreover, the model was exclusively based on protein sequence comparisons, so that the precise mechanism of reverse gyrase is still a matter of hypotheses. In order to confirm these, we expressed separately in Escherichia coli the entire 1247 amino acid putative coding sequence ofS. acidocaldarius reverse gyrase and its putative helicase-like (amino acids 1–612) and topoisomerase (residues 610–1247) domains. In the present paper, we show that full-length recombinant reverse gyrase, when expressed at 37 °C in E. coli, is able to sustain efficient positive supercoiling at 75 °C in the presence of ATP, without requiring any preheating treatment. As expected, mutation of the putative active site tyrosine 964 into a phenylalanine completely abolished this activity. In addition, the putative topoisomerase I domain alone, expressed in E. coli, exhibited an ATP-independent DNA relaxation activity on negative supercoils at 75 °C. By contrast, we failed to detect any helicase activity for the N-terminal domain as for the whole reverse gyrase. However, simple mixing of the two domains reconstitutes the ATP-dependent positive supercoiling typical of reverse gyrase. The interaction between the domains seems rather specific, since the topoisomerase domain cannot be replaced by another thermophilic topoisomerase I, and the helicase-like domain cannot be replaced by a thermophilic helicase. Finally, we show that the stoichiometric DNA unwinding activity is not an intrinsic property of the helicase-like domain, contrary to our previous estimation (17.Jaxel C. Bouthier de La Tour C. Duguet M. Nadal M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4668-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Like the supercoiling activity, DNA unwinding requires the presence of both domains, be they separately expressed or linked in a single polypeptide. These results suggest a mechanism in which the N-terminal domain does not directly unwind DNA but is more likely a protein motor, driving conformational changes within the whole enzyme. Bacterial strains used in this work were DH5α (cloning) and XL mutS Kanr (mutagenesis). Culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes, T4, and Thermus DNA ligases were purchased from New England Biolabs, and oligonucleotides were from Genosys. Reverse gyrase and its putative domains were produced in E. coli as glutathioneS-transferase (GST)1 fusion proteins, with the pGEX expression system described by Smith and Johnson (18.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). The reverse gyrase complete coding sequence from S. acidocaldarius was inserted in two steps into the pGEX-2TH vector. (i) We used polymerase chain reaction to insert a BamHI site immediately 5′ to the first codon and to amplify the 5′ terminus of the gene from a recombinant λ phage carrying the entire gene (12.Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. de La Tour C.B. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was digested by BamHI andBsaBI. (ii) The same λ phage was digested byBsaBI and HindIII to prepare the 3′ part of the gene, and both fragments were inserted into theBamHI-HindIII site of the vector. The design of the reverse gyrase domains and their boundaries was exclusively based on the sequence: we used secondary structure predictions (Mac Molly package, Soft Gene, GmbH) to define a flexible loop, located about 15 amino acids upstream the first topoisomerase motif, as the junction between the two putative domains. We thus defined the helicase-like domain as amino acids 1–612 and the topoisomerase domain as amino acids 610–1247. The corresponding DNA segments were inserted into the cloning vector by using the same strategy as for the complete enzyme. Mutagenesis of the putative active site tyrosine into a phenylalanine was performed with the ChameleonTM kit of Stratagene, as described by the manufacturer, to yield the RG-Y964F and RG Top Y352F mutants. Two liters of LB broth were inoculated with E. coli DH5α strain carrying the various plasmid constructions. Cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration to an A 600 of 0.8, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 2 h, cells were quickly cooled on ice and harvested. The cell paste (4 g) was resuspended in 10 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40), and the cells were lysed in a French press at 9,000 pounds/square inch. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose (from Sigma) using a batch procedure modified from Smith and Johnson (18.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5026) Google Scholar); the crude extract was stirred with 1.6 ml of glutathione-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resin was harvested by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min. After extensive washing with 1 mNaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, the fusion proteins were eluted by 20 mm reduced glutathione. The GST tag was removed by incubation for 3 h at 26 °C with thrombin. In the case of the full-length reverse gyrase, an additional purification step on phenyl-Sepharose was necessary to remove fragments produced by proteolysis or incomplete expression. The sample, adjusted to 300 mm NaCl, was loaded onto a 0.5-ml phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mmNaCl). After the column was washed by 25% ethylene glycol in the same buffer, reverse gyrase was eluted by 60% ethylene glycol. The various fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and checked for topoisomerase activities. This assay was essentially based on the displacement of a labeled oligonucleotide from a partial duplex, with modifications for an adaptation to high temperatures. Two types of substrates were used. In the first substrate (19.Bird E.L. Hakansson K. Pan H. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2620-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a 82-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Biolabs) was annealed to M13mp18 single-strand circles through its central part (nucleotides 24–59) leaving both a 5′ tail (residues 1–23) and a 3′ tail (residues 60–82) unhybridized. Other oligonucleotides, untailed or simply tailed, were also used. In the second type of substrate, described by Tanguy Le Gac et al.(20.Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13801-13807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a 5′-labeled 59-mer oligonucleotide was partially hybridized (over 34 nucleotides) to a 90-mer, forming an asymmetric Y-shaped substrate, with a 5′-labeled 25 nucleotide tail and a 3′-unlabeled 56 nucleotide tail. The reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 0.02 pmol of substrate, and various amounts of the recombinant proteins to test (up to 500 ng). For the second type of substrates, a 27-mer oligonucleotide, complementary to the 90-mer, was added in 4-fold excess to trap the displaced 90-mer. After 10–30 min at various temperatures, the products were analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. PcrA helicase from Bacillus stearothermophilus used as a control was a generous gift of Dr. D. B. Wigley (Oxford). The same assay was used to monitor the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA and positive supercoiling, both activities corresponding to an increase of the DNA linking number. The recombinant proteins (0.5–10 ng) were incubated in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin with 400 ng of negatively supercoiled pTZ18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 75 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP. Reactions were stopped by quick cooling on ice and addition of 0.5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. The incubation products were analyzed by bidimensional 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (21.Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), with addition of 3 μg/ml chloroquine in the gel and the buffer for the second electrophoresis. For some experiments, monodimensional, 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis was performed. This assay measures the change in the DNA linking number after stoichiometric binding of a form II DNA with a protein and closure by ligase. In our case, the assay was performed at 75 °C, essentially as described previously (10.Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures (20 μl each in siliconized tubes) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 25 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm NAD, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 33 ng of pTZ 18 form II DNA with an average of one single-strand break per circle, and various amounts of proteins to be tested. Two microliters of a dilution of Taq DNA ligase (Biolabs, 2 units) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol were introduced, prior to incubation at 75 °C, as a drop on the inner wall of each siliconized tube but not mixed with the reaction medium. After 10 min of incubation at 75 °C, each tube was quickly agitated to mix the ligase drop with the other components and further incubated for 5 min at 75 °C. This procedure allowed us to avoid variations in the linking number due to temperature changes. After incubation, the tubes were cooled, centrifuged for 30 s, and treated with 50 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 50 °C. The reaction products were separated by bidimensional gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a 33P-labeled pTZ18 probe (random priming, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The products were revealed either by autoradiography or by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The entire 1247 amino acid coding sequence of reverse gyrase from S. acidocaldarius was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with GST and partly purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (see “Experimental Procedures”). In all conditions tested, the level of expression was low, and after the fusion polypeptide was cleaved by thrombin, an additional purification step on phenyl-Sepharose was needed to remove a large part of the remaining contaminants (Fig.1 A). These contaminants, eluted at 25% ethylene glycol (lane 1), are fragments of reverse gyrase since they react with antibodies directed against reverse gyrase in Western blots but have no detectable activity on supercoiled DNA. The main polypeptide, eluted at 60% ethylene glycol, had the expected size for full-length reverse gyrase on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4). This recombinant protein was able to fully convert negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA to positive supercoils at 75 °C in the presence of ATP, as shown on the bidimensional analysis of Fig.1 B. This result suggests that, although expressed inE. coli at 37 °C and inactive at this temperature, recombinant reverse gyrase is correctly folded to be active at high temperature as is the enzyme from Sulfolobus. As expected, the mutant enzyme obtained by converting tyrosine 964 into a phenylalanine totally lacks topoisomerase activity, confirming the identity of the active site tyrosine (see Fig. 1 C). Since sequence analysis (12.Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. de La Tour C.B. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) suggested that the N-terminal part of reverse gyrase had helicase signatures, and the C-terminal part exhibited topoisomerase I motifs, we designed two polypeptides, covering each half of the whole reverse gyrase sequence. The rationale for the design of these proteins is based on secondary structure predictions and the presence of a highly conserved region in the N terminus of the topoisomerase part (see “Experimental Procedures”). We then expressed both putative domains separately, using the same GST fusion expression system. The helicase-like domain appears as a main band of the expected size, whereas the topoisomerase domain invariably appears as a triplet (Fig.2 A), reminiscent of reverse gyrase degradation fragments (see Fig. 1 A, lane 1). As expected, the putative topoisomerase I domain was able to partly relax a negatively supercoiled plasmid in an ATP-independent reaction at 75 °C (Fig. 2 B, middle). This result, and the complete lack of activity of the putative active site mutant Y352F (data not shown), confirmed that the C-terminal part of reverse gyrase was indeed a topoisomerase domain, as suspected from its sequence. However, this domain exhibited a poor relaxation efficiency (see Fig.2 B, middle, C, panel a, and D, panel g). The putative helicase domain was tested for helicase activity against a variety of substrates formed by untailed, 5′-tailed, 3′-tailed, or doubly tailed oligonucleotides annealed to M13 single-strand circles (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.3, neither the helicase-like domain nor the full-length reverse gyrase exhibited helicase activity on the doubly tailed substrate, whereas the thermophilic helicase PcrA fromB. stearothermophilus (22.Bird E.L. Branningan J.A. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was able to partially release the 82-mer oligonucleotide (panel 3). The same result was obtained with the other substrates in a variety of experimental conditions, at 37, 50, 60, or 70 °C (not shown). In another set of experiments, a Y-shaped substrate formed by partial annealing of a 90-mer oligonucleotide to a 5′-labeled 59-mer was used in place of M13 substrates (see “Experimental Procedures”) to avoid possible trapping of the proteins by the large amount of M13 single-strand present. Again, in our hands, only the PcrA helicase was able to displace the 59-mer oligonucleotide. We next tried to reconstitute reverse gyrase by simply mixing the two domains at a molar ratio of 1:1. Indeed, incubation of this mixture with plasmid DNA at 75 °C produced ATP-dependent positive supercoiling as efficiently as the full-length enzyme (compare Fig. 2 B, bottom with Fig.1 B, left). In this test, the helicase-like domain alone had no apparent activity on the DNA substrate, whereas the topoisomerase domain exhibited a low relaxation activity (Fig. 2 B,top and middle panels). Remarkably, this latter activity is stimulated by the presence of the helicase-like domain in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2 B, compare middle tobottom). The appearance of a reverse gyrase activity was monitored by adding increasing amounts of the helicase-like domain to a fixed amount of the topoisomerase domain (Fig. 2 C, panels a–f); a plateau of activity was obtained for a 1/1 Hel/Top molar ratio (panel e). Addition of excess “helicase” had no detectable effect (panel f). The same result was obtained by testing increasing amounts of the topoisomerase domain at fixed helicase concentration (not shown). Interestingly, excess of the topoisomerase domain did not change the topoisomer distribution, confirming that this domain was not able to relax positive supercoils. Unexpectedly, when amounts of the topoisomerase domain, low enough to present no visible activity on the substrate (Fig. 2 D,panel g), were supplemented by the helicase-like domain, an efficient reverse gyrase activity was nevertheless reconstituted (panel h). This indicates a strong activation of the topoisomerase activity through interactions between the domains. Finally, reconstitution did not need a preincubation of the mixed domains at low or high temperature, suggesting that when expressed inE. coli, the domains already had a conformation allowing mutual recognition or can acquire it very rapidly when the temperature is increased. Together, these results suggest that the separately expressed domains form a heterodimer that mimics reverse gyrase. The stability of the reconstituted activity toward ionic strength and temperature was compared with that of reverse gyrase. As shown on Fig. 4, the activity of the full-length recombinant enzyme is poor at 30 mmsalt, maximal around 120 mm, and still important at 200 mm, which is similar to the behavior of the endogenous reverse gyrase from Sulfolobus (21.Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). By contrast, the activity exhibited by the mixture of the two domains is highest at low salt and practically nonexistent at 200 mm. The same type of result was obtained when increasing the incubation temperature up to 90 °C; the mixed domains lost their ability to produce positive supercoiling, whereas reverse gyrase retained some activity (not shown). These results suggest a relatively tight association between the domains, which is, however, not strong enough to retain activity in high salt or temperature conditions in the absence of a covalent link between them. The next question that we addressed was how specific the interaction is between the two domains. In other words, supposing that reverse gyrase is a modular enzyme, is it possible to replace either module by a functional equivalent? To test this possibility, we replaced the topoisomerase domain by the type I topoisomerase from Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium (23.Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 24.Bouthier de La Tour C. Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Huber R. Duguet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This choice had two advantages as follows: (i) this topoisomerase works at 75–80 °C, and (ii) it has approximately the same size (633 amino acids) as the topoisomerase domain of reverse gyrase (635 amino acids). Incubation of the Thermotogatopoisomerase I with the helicase-like domain of reverse gyrase in the usual reaction mixture did not reveal any positive supercoiling activity (Fig. 5, top), and all conditions tested failed to detect this activity. The same result was obtained when the full-length reverse gyrase mutated in its active site tyrosine (Y964F) was incubated with the Thermotogatopoisomerase I (Fig. 5, bottom). However, in both cases, the presence of the helicase domain, free or included in the reverse gyrase mutant, appeared to stimulate the relaxation activity of theThermotoga topoisomerase, independently of the presence of ATP (compare panels 1 and 2 to 3 and4 and panelss 5 and 6 to 7and 8). The possibility to replace the helicase-like domain by a “true” thermophilic helicase, the PcrA helicase from B. stearothermophilus (22.Bird E.L. Branningan J.A. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in the reconstitution assay was also tested and failed (not shown). In a previous work, we showed that in the absence of ATP and at high temperature, the stoichiometric binding ofSulfolobus reverse gyrase to an open circular DNA resulted in a decrease of the DNA linking number after closure by a thermophilic ligase. This was interpreted as an unwinding of the DNA upon reverse gyrase binding (10.Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a property that is shared by some helicases. We decided first to test this property with the recombinant reverse gyrase mutated on the active site tyrosine (Y964F), so that there was no possible DNA cleavage or interference with the positive supercoiling activity. In addition, it was possible to check the effect of ATP and non-hydrolyzable analogs on this unwinding activity. Incubation at 75 °C of an open circular plasmid with increasing amounts of this mutant in the absence of ATP, followed by covalent closure with the ligase from Thermus, resulted in the progressive appearance"

Two lines of evidence establish a critical role for PS in the production of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ). FAD-linked PS mutations elevate the levels of highly amyloidogenic Aβ ending at residue 42 (Aβ42), and cells with ablated PS1 alleles secrete low levels of Aβ. Several recent reports have shown that the hydrophilic loop (HL) domain, located between transmembrane domains 6 and 7, contains sites for phosphorylation, caspase cleavage, and sequences that bind several PS-interacting proteins. In the present report, we examined the metabolism of PS polypeptides lacking the HL domain and the influence of these molecules on Aβ production. We report that the deletion of the HL domain does not have a deleterious effect on the regulated endoproteolysis of PS, saturable accumulation of PS fragments, or the self-association of PS fragments. Aβ production was not significantly altered in cells expressing HL-deleted PS polypeptides compared with cells expressing full-length PS. Importantly, deletion of the HL domain did not affect FAD mutation-mediated elevation in the production of Aβ42. Furthermore, the deletion of the HL domain did not impair the role of PS1 or PS2 in facilitating Notch processing. Thus, our results argue against a biologically or pathologically relevant role for the HL domain phosphorylation and caspase cleavage and the association of PS HL domain-interacting proteins, in amyloid precursor protein metabolism and Aβ production or Notch cleavage.

Little is known about the proteolytic cleavage of PS, the mechanism that regulates PS fragment accumulation, and the domains of PS that are essential for the pathogenic function of mutant PS. In this study, we focused on the role of the cytoplasmic loop (Cys263-Leu381) between transmembrane (TM) 6 and TM 7, termed the “loop” domain, in PS endoproteolysis and mutant PS-mediated Aβ42 production. The NH2-terminal one-third of the loop domain is rich in hydrophobic residues, highly conserved between PS1 homologues, and harbors several FAD-linked mutations; the site of regulated endoproteolytic cleavage (Met292) is located within the hydrophobic stretch (21.Steiner H.

Nevertheless, several findings have suggested that the HL domain may be important for the biological functions of PS.

Nordstedt C. Petanceska S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K. Hahne S. Fraser P. Levesque L. Czernik A.J. George-Hyslop P.S. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Tanzi R.E. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5961-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); it has been shown that phosphorylation of PS2 within the HL domain can regulate caspase cleavage and modulate antiapoptotic properties of the PS2 CTF (29.Walter J.

Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Finally, several laboratories have independently identified interactions between several members of the armadillo family of proteins and PS (31; reviewed in Ref. 32.Thinakaran G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1321-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); the binding of p0071 and β-catenin to PS has been mapped to the HL domain (33; this study). To address the importance of the HL domain for the biology of PS, we chose to characterize PS1 and PS2 polypeptides that lack this region. Our studies show that the HL domain is dispensable for endoproteolysis of PS and stabilization of resultant derivatives. Furthermore, we document that the deletion of the PS HL domain does not affect FAD-linked mutant PS1- or PS2-mediated production of Aβ42 peptides. A cDNA encoding PS1 lacking the HL domain (amino acids 304–371) was generated as follows. A 345-base pair DNA fragment that encodes PS1 amino acids 195–303 and contains PflM1 and BbsI sites at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CGCTACATTACTGTTGCACTCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCTGGGTCTTCCGGGTCTCCTTCTGC-3′. The PCR product was digested with PflM1 and BbsI and ligated to plasmid pBSPS1 (12.Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M.

The deletion was verified by sequencing, and the PS1ΔHL insert was cloned into a pCDNA3.1 expression vector. FAD-linked M146L, H163R, and C410Y mutations were introduced into PS1ΔHL cDNA by exchanging appropriate mutant DNA fragments from mutant PS1 cDNAs (9.Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G. Eckman C.B. Lee M.K.

A DNA fragment that encodes PS2 amino acids 269–309 and 353–448 was generated by overlap extension PCR as follows. Two PCRs were performed, one with the primer pair 5′-CCGGATCCTGTCCCAAAGGGCCT-3′ (PS2Floop) and 5′-CCTTTCCTCCTCTTCCTCGGGGTCCAGCTTCGCC-3′ and another with the primer pair 5′-GGCGAAGCTGGACCCCGAGGAAGAGGAGGAAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCGTCTAGACCTCAGATGTAGAGCTGATG-3′ (PS2SR). Subsequently, the two PCR products from the earlier step were mixed and amplified using primers PS2Floop and PS2SR. The final PCR product was digested withBamHI and XbaI and ligated to pCDNA3.1 vector, and the insert sequence was verified. Subsequently,Asp718-PflMI fragments isolated from wild-type (Wt) or mutant PS2 cDNAs (13.Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Full-length PS2 and PS2ΔHL cDNAs were also cloned into the bicistronic vector, pIRES1hyg (CLONTECH). Expression plasmid encoding truncated Notch1, mNotchΔE, has been described previously (35.Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey S. Nye, Northwestern University Medical School). Monkey COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells were cultured in 1:1 Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. N2a cells were transfected with PS1ΔHL plasmid, and independent stable clones were selected in medium containing G418. To examine alternate cleavage of PS1, cells were incubated with 500 nm staurosporine for 6 or 12 h. Stable N2a cell line, Swe.10, stably transfected with APP695 harboring a “Swedish” double mutation (APPswe) was described previously (36.Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Double stable (APPswe and PS2) cell lines were generated by transfecting Swe.10 cells with PS2 or PS2ΔHL cDNAs cloned in pIRES1hyg and selecting stable pools in medium containing 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin. Because the selection marker is translated from a bicistronic transcript using an internal ribosomal entry site located 3′ to the PS2 cDNA, all hygromycin-resistant clones express PS2 polypeptides albeit at varying levels. Primary mouse fibroblasts (PS1+/+ and PS1−/−) were cultured as described (43.Berechid B.E. Thinakaran G. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S. Nye J.S. Curr.

To generate an antibody that reacted with the COOH terminus of PS1, a rabbit was immunized with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide, which corresponds to PS1 amino acids 453–467 of PS1. The resulting antiserum, PS-C3, was affinity purified and characterized as described previously (38.Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Takahashi H. Murayama O. Murayama M. Sato K. Omori A.

COOH-terminal epitope-tagged mNotchΔE polypeptides were detected by monoclonal Myc antibody 9E10. Monoclonal β-catenin antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. To quantify APP synthesis, cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min, and APP was immunoprecipitated using a COOH-terminal antibody, CT15, as described (36.Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Secreted Aβ species ending at 40 or 42/43 residues were quantified from media conditioned by double-transfected COS cells or stable N2a cell lines using BNT77/BA27 or BC05 two-site ELISA as described previously (10.Tomita T.

Measurements of Aβx-40, Aβx-42(43), or Aβx-42(43)/total Aβ ratio were statistically examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Scheffe's test and expressed as mean ± S.E. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were generated by subcloning the indicated loop sequences from PS1 (corresponding to amino acids 331–351, 331–360, 351–375, 319–340, 319–360, and 263–407) or from PS2 (corresponding to amino acids 306–366) into pGEX4T-1 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterial expression of GST-PS1 and GST-PS2 fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Induced proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Affinity precipitation of β-catenin was carried out as follows: clarified mouse brain lysates (0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40) were incubated with GST-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 1 μg of the indicated GST-PS1 or GST-PS2 fusion proteins were added to 200 μg of precleared lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 buffer, and bound β-catenin was identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. To investigate whether the nonconserved HL region of PS plays an essential role in PS1 metabolism, we constructed a cDNA that encodes a human PS1 polypeptide without the HL region (Glu304-Gly371), termed PS1ΔHL (Fig.1 A). The site of regulated endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (Met292) (21.Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22.Podlisny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Diehl T. Levesque G. Fraser P. Haass C. Koo E.H.

Dis. 1997; 3: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) is present in PS1ΔHL, but the site of caspase cleavage (Asp345) has been deleted. Endoproteolysis of PS1ΔHL was examined by generating independent stable N2a cell lines expressing PS1ΔHL. Antibody PS1NT, generated against PS1 NH2 terminus (37.Thinakaran G. Regard J.B. Bouton C.M.L. Harris C.L. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 4: 438-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), reacted with the “full-length” PS1ΔHL (Fig. 1 B, top panel, lanes 2–4). In addition, PS1NT reacted with a ∼30-kDa PS1ΔHL-derived NTF, which exhibited slightly accelerated migration on gels compared with endogenous mouse PS1-derived NTF (lane 1) and co-migrated with full-length human PS1-derived NTF (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the 30-kDa fragment is a derivative of the endoproteolytic processing of human PS1ΔHL. We previously demonstrated that PS1 NTF and CTF accumulation is a saturable process and that overexpression of human PS polypeptides in N2a cells interfered with the accumulation of endogenous murine PS derivatives (12.Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

To determine if the expression of PS1ΔHL also resulted in the diminished accumulation of endogenous murine PS1 derivatives, we performed Western blot analysis using αPS1Loop. Because the epitopes recognized by αPS1Loop lie within the HL domain (12.Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), this reagent does not react with PS1ΔHL or the CTF derived from PS1ΔHL (CTFΔHL). In each of the stable PS1ΔHL clones, αPS1Loop only detected a weak signal for the mouse PS1-derived CTFs as compared with cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1 B, bottom). As described above, endoproteolysis of PS1ΔHL at or near Met292 generated a 30-kDa NTF similar in size to the NTF generated from full-length PS1. Hence, we expected that a shorter ∼9-kDa CTFΔHL will accumulate in PS1ΔHL cells. To confirm that the diminution in murine PS1 CTF was accompanied by the accumulation of CTFΔHL, we performed Western blots using PS-C3, an antibody raised against the COOH terminus of PS1. Antibody PS-C3 reacted with the 18-kDa CTF derived from full-length PS1, and ∼9-kDa CTFΔHL derived from PS1ΔHL (Fig.1 C, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). As was the case of CTF derived from full-length PS1, CTFΔHLaccumulated to saturable levels in independent clones that expressed variable levels of PS1ΔHL (data not shown). Next, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies to assess whether the NTF and CTFΔHL derived from PS1ΔHL could be coisolated. Using previously described methods (37.Thinakaran G. Regard J.B. Bouton C.M.L. Harris C.L. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 4: 438-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we show that PS1NTantiserum could coimmunoprecipitate NTF and CTFΔHLfrom detergent extracts of stable N2a cells expressing PS1ΔHL (Fig.1 C, lanes 5 and 6). PS1- or PS1ΔHL-derived CTFs were not coprecipitated by a control antibody, superoxide dismutase 1, generated against superoxide dismutase (lanes 7 and 8). These results demonstrate that the deletion of the HL domain of PS1 does not affect the regulated endoproteolytic processing of PS1, saturable accumulation of PS1 fragments, or the association of NTF and CTF. Previously, it was demonstrated that in cells treated with staurosporine, an agent that induces apoptosis, full-length PS1 undergoes cleavage by caspases to generate “alternate” CTF (aCTF) (23.Kim T.W.

Caspase cleavage of PS1 has been mapped to a single site (Asp345) located within the HL domain (25.Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Brockhaus M. Reinhardt D. Nelboeck P. Mous J. Grunberg J. Haass C.

Vesicle budding is presumed to occur concomitantly, mediating the retrieval of plasmalemmal components and the regulation of phagosomal size. We analyzed whether fission of vesicles from phagosomes requires COPI, a multimeric complex known to be involved in budding from the Golgi and endosomes. The role of COPI was studied using ldlF cells, that harbor a temperature-sensitive mutation in ε-COP, a subunit of the coatomer complex. These cells were made phagocytic toward IgG-opsonized particles by heterologous expression of human FcγRIIA receptors. Following incubation at the restrictive temperature, ε-COP was degraded in these cells and their Golgi complex dispersed. Nevertheless, phagocytosis persisted for hours in cells devoid of ε-COP. Retrieval of transferrin receptors from phagosomes became inefficient in the absence of ε-COP, while clearance of the FcγRIIA receptors was unaffected. This indicates that fission of vesicles from the phagosomal membrane involves at least two mechanisms, one of which requires intact COPI. Traffic of fluid-phase markers and aggregated IgG-receptor complexes along the endocytic pathway was abnormal in ε-COP-deficient cells. In contrast, phagosome fusion with endosomes and lysosomes was unimpaired. Moreover, the resulting phagolysosomes were highly acidic. Similar results were obtained in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with brefeldin A, which precludes COPI assembly by interfering with the activation of adenosine ribosylation factor. These data indicate that neither phagosome formation nor maturation are absolutely dependent on COPI. Our findings imply that phagosomal maturation differs from endosomal progression, which appears to be more dependent on COPI-mediated formation of carrier vesicles.

During the course of maturation, phagosomes progressively acquire a variety of proteins that are characteristic of endosomes and lysosomes (4.Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J.

One of the protein complexes inserted into the phagosomal membrane through fusion with endomembranes, the vacuolar-type ATPase, mediates the acidification of the phagosomal lumen (22.Geisow M.J. D'Arcy Hart P. Young M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 23.Lukacs G.L. Rotstein O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Conversely, surface proteins that were internalized during the invagination of the plasma membrane are gradually removed from the phagosome as it matures (9.Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25.Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Schwartz A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 126-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least some of these proteins appear to be recycled back to the plasma membrane (6.Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10.Ryter A. Comp. Immunol. Microbiol. Infect.

Steinman R.M. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this regard, the phagosome has been shown to be a complete antigen processing compartment, so that MHC-II·antigen complexes formed therein appear on the plasma membrane (28.Ramachandra L. Song R. Harding C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3263-3272PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of vesicular budding in the salvage of plasmalemmal components, antigen presentation and the maintenance of phagosomal size, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In other organelles, such as the Golgi complex, several fission systems have been characterized, including the clathrin, COPI, and COPII complexes. Clathrin has been found to associate with the nascent phagosome, although its precise role in maturation remains unclear (9.Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar,29.Aggeler J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Amorphous coats, distinct from those generated by clathrin, have also been found on phagosomes (6.Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These may be related to the COP systems of other endomembranes. Of particular interest are recent findings indicating that normal delivery of cargo from early to late endosomes and lysosomes requires COPI. This was inferred from the observation that microinjection of antibodies to the β-COP subunit of COPI precluded early to late endosomal traffic (30.Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was reached using the ldlF Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1 cell line, which have a temperature-sensitive mutation in ε-COP, a subunit of the COPI complex (31.Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32.Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Like wild-type CHO cells, ldlF cells are normally infected by vesicular stomatitis virus at the permissive temperature. At the restrictive temperature ε-COP becomes unstable and is rapidly degraded. Under these conditions viral infection is completely arrested, indicating the failure of the virus to reach the acidic late endosomes (35.Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, progression of fluid-phase markers like horseradish peroxidase into the late endocytic compartment was at least partially blocked (33.Gu F. Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 35.Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), as was the case for complexes formed between epidermal growth factor and its receptor (35.Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results imply that COPI is essential for endosomal progression and are consistent with the reported effects of brefeldin A on endosomal function and morphology (36.Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 67: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 37.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D.

Brefeldin A is a specific inhibitor of GTP exchange factors of the adenosine ribosylation factor (ARF) family of GTPases (39.Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) which are essential for COPI function (40.Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar,41.Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12083-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of COPI in the endocytic pathway is consistent with both the “endosome maturation” and “vesicle shuttle” models, two competing hypotheses offered to explain how internalized molecules progress along the endocytic pathway. The vesicle shuttle model proposes that endosomes are stable, long-lived organelles that deliver cargo to the downstream compartment via vesicular intermediates (42.Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 43.Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the maturation model envisions the gradual modification of endocytic compartments by a series of fusion and fission events (19.Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21.Ward D.M. Perou C.M. Lloyd M. Kaplan J. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 72-82Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar). While endocytic progression is a subject of ongoing debate, there is little disagreement that phagosomes mature (6.Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Regardless of the uncertainties regarding endosomal progression, there is a striking resemblance between the endocytic and phagocytic pathways. In both cases, vesicles/vacuoles detach from the plasmalemma and acquire sequentially Rab5 and Rab7, followed by lysosome-associated membrane proteins (or LAMPs) and lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin (4.Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 19.Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J.

Moreover, both systems undergo a gradual acidification, suggestive of progressive insertion of V-ATPases (23.Lukacs G.L. Rotstein O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21099-21107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Lukacs G.L. Rotstein O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Hollenbeck P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3156-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Lastly, as in the case of endosomes, both ARF and the β-COP subunit of COPI were reported to associate with phagosomal membranes in vitro (6.Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30.Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The similarity between these processes, together with the established role of COPI in endosomal progression, prompted us to analyze the role of COPI in phagosomal maturation. Two approaches were used: (i) ARF exchange factors were inhibited in RAW264.7 macrophages using brefeldin A and (ii) the ε-COP subunit of COPI was eliminated using the temperature-sensitive mutant ldlF cell line. The latter was derived from CHO cells, which are not professional phagocytes. In order to study phagosomal maturation in ldlF cells, they were heterologously transfected with cDNA encoding the human FcγRIIA receptor. It was shown earlier that expression of Fcγ receptors suffices to confer phagocytic capabilities to nonmyeloid cells such as COS and CHO (54.Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Hunter S. Mantaring M. Schreiber A.D. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 44: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,55.Nagarajan S. Chesla S. Cobern L. Anderson P. Zhu C. Selvaraj P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25762-25770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Such transfectants not only internalize IgG-opsonized particles, but the resulting phagosomes undergo a maturation process that faithfully recapitulates the maturation sequence described in professional phagocytes (56.Downey G. Botelho R.J. Butler J.R. Moltyaner Y. Chien P. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28436-28444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Comparison of the rate and extent of maturation when FcγRIIA-transfected ldlF cells were incubated at the permissive or restrictive temperatures allowed us to assess the role of COPI in vesicular fission from phagosomes. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies. Bafilomycin, concanamycin, and G418 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Brefeldin A was obtained from the Upjohn Laboratories (Kalamazoo, MI). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), lysine-fixable FITC-dextranMr 3000, FITC- and rhodamine-conjugated human transferrin (Tf), monensin, nigericin, Oregon Green-dextranM r 10,000 and zymosan were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sheep red blood cells (RBC) and rabbit anti-sheep RBC antibodies were from ICN-Cappel. Human IgG and mouse anti-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Mouse anti-hamster (UH1) and rat anti-mouse (1D4B) LAMP1 antibodies were from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, maintained by the University of Iowa and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD). Monoclonal anti-Tf receptor antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(San Francisco, CA). Mouse anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3 was from Medarex (Annandale, NJ). Monoclonal anti-giantin and rabbit anti-ε-COP antibodies were gifts of Drs. H. P. Hauri (University of Basel Switzerland) and M. Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA), respectively. FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-human, anti-mouse, and anti-rat, Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse, and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). ldlF cells were the generous gift of Dr. M. Krieger. CHO and RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). CHO and ldlF cells were transfected with cDNA encoding the FcγRIIA by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (57.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) and stable transfectants were selected with 2 g/liter G418. Resistant cells were cloned and screened for FcγRIIA expression and for the ability to internalize IgG-opsonized particles. The resulting stable lines, called hereafter FcR-CHO and FcR-ldl, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 g/liter G418. RAW264.7 and FcR-CHO cells were incubated at 37 °C while ldlF and FcR-ldl were maintained at the permissive temperature of 34 °C. Degradation of ε-COP was induced by shifting FcR-ldl cells to the restrictive temperature of 39 °C for the indicated period. All cell lines were cultured under a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Transient transfection of the human transferrin receptor (TfR) into FcR-ldl cells was accomplished using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pCDM8 vector encoding human TfR was a kind gift of Dr. J. Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). FcR-ldl and FcR-CHO cells were grown to confluency and incubated at 39 °C for the indicated time points. Whole cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, according to the method of Laemmli (58.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto a polivinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), blocked with 5% milk for 1 h and incubated with rabbit anti-ε-COP at 1:8000 or mouse anti-tubulin at 1:5000 for 1 h, followed by donkey HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for visualization. Immunoblots were digitally scanned and the intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified using the NIH Image software. Sheep RBC were opsonized with rabbit anti-sheep RBC antibody at 1:50 for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Typically ≈50 RBC were added per macrophage or FcR-ldl cell to initiate phagocytosis. To limit the time of phagocytosis, adherent external RBC were lysed by hypotonic shock as described earlier (59.Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Sjolin C. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). All incubations during the phagocytosis and maturation assays were at 34 °C. To measure intraphagosomal pH, zymosan was labeled with both Oregon Green 514 and FITC as described (56.Downey G. Botelho R.J. Butler J.R. Moltyaner Y. Chien P. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28436-28444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Labeled zymosan was then opsonized with 1 mg/ml human IgG for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times. FcR-ldl cells were then allowed to internalize opsonized zymosan for 1 h before pH measurements were initiated. To label the early endocytic compartment, FcR-ldl and RAW264.7 cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 1 h and then incubated with 50 μg/ml rhodamine-Tf for 1 h. Membrane-bound Tf was cleared by a 7-min chase before initiation of phagocytosis. To examine progression of internalized aggregated IgG to late endosomes/lysosomes, human IgG at 10 mg/ml was aggregated by heating at 65 °C for 20 min. Insoluble complexes were then sedimented and 1 mg/ml soluble aggregated IgG was added to cells for 30 min. After washing, internalized IgG complexes were chased for 2 h, fixed, and prepared for detection of LAMP1 by immunofluorescence. Progression of material taken up by fluid-phase endocytosis to the late endosomes/lysosomes was examined by incubating cells with 250 μg/ml FITC-dextran lysine-fixable,M r 3000 for 30 min and chasing for 4 h. Late endosomes and lysosomes in FcR-ldl cells were identified by labeling with anti-hamster LAMP1 monoclonal antibody (undiluted) after fixation with methanol. Fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and methanol permeabilization was used instead when simultaneous FITC-dextran labeling and immunostaining for hamster LAMP1 was necessary. Murine LAMP1 was detected with rat anti-LAMP1 at 1:2 dilution after paraformaldehyde fixation and methanol permeabilization. FcγRIIA, the Golgi apparatus, and TfR were labeled with monoclonal antibodies to FcγRIIA (1:200), giantin (1:1000), or TfR (1:250), respectively, after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton. Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary anti-human, anti-mouse, anti-rat, and anti-rabbit were all used at 1:1000. Samples were analyzed with a Leica fluorescence microscope (model DMIRB) with a ×100 oil immersion objective and the appropriate filter set. Cells and phagosomes were clearly identifiable under DIC optics. Images were digitally acquired with a cooled charge-coupled device camera controlled by the Winview software (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. For measurement of intraorganellar pH, sorting and recycling endosomes were labeled with FITC-Tf as described above and were identified by their peripheral and juxtanuclear localization, respectively. To measure the lysosomal pH, cells were labeled with 1 mg/ml Oregon Green-dextranM r 10,000 for 1 h, chased for 4 h, and subsequently incubated at the indicated temperature overnight before imaging. Phagosomal pH was measured by covalently labeling zymosan with pH-sensitive probes, as detailed above. Resting pH values were obtained in cells bathed in sodium-rich medium (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, 15 mmHepes, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Calibration of fluorescenceversus pH was obtained by substituting the sodium-rich buffer with potassium-rich medium (140 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm Hepes), adjusted to the desired pH with KOH, followed by addition of the cation/H+ionophores monensin (2 μm) and nigericin (5 μm). Internalized zymosan particles were identified by their insensitivity to abrupt changes in extracellular pH and by their responsiveness to the addition of 10 mm NH4Cl (see Ref. 60.Hackam D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2002444558,"Among the most conserved regions in the G-protein-coupled receptors is the (N/D)PX2–3Y motif of the seventh transmembrane domain (X represents any amino acid). The mutation of the Asn/Asp residue of this motif in different G-protein-coupled receptors was shown to affect the activation of either adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C. We have mutated the Asn residue (Asn-391) of the NPXXY motif in the CCKBR to Ala and determined the effects of the mutation on binding, signaling, and G-proteins coupling after expression of the mutated receptor in COS cells. The mutated receptor displayed similar expression levels and high affinity CCK binding compared with the wild type CCKBR. However, unlike the wild type CCKBR, the mutated receptor was completely unable to mediate activation of either phospholipase C and protein kinase C-dependent and -independent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, indicating an essential role of Asn-391 in CCKBR signaling. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments allowed us to show that the inactive mutant retains an intact capacity to form stable complexes with Gqα subunits in response to CCK. These results indicate that the formation of high affinity CCK-receptor-Gq protein complexes is not sufficient to activate Gq and suggest that Asn-391 is specifically involved in Gq proteins activation."

To better understand mechanisms underlying the regulation of JNK activities, we studied the effect of expression of the amino-terminal JNK fragment (N-JNK; amino acids 1–206) on the stability and activities of JNK substrates under nonstressed growth conditions, as well as after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Mouse fibroblasts that express N-JNK under tetracycline-off (tet-off) inducible promoter exhibited elevated expression of c-Jun, ATF2, and p53 upon tetracycline removal. This increased coincided with elevated transcriptional activities of p53, but not of c-Jun or ATF2, as reflected in luciferase activities ofp21Waf1/Cip1 -Luc, AP1-Luc, andJun2-Luc, respectively. Expression of N-JNK in cells that were treated with H2O2 impaired transcriptional output as reflected in a delayed and lower level of c-Jun-, limited ATF2-, and reduced p53-transcriptional activities. N-JNK elicited an increase in H2O2-induced cell death, which is p53-dependent, because it was not seen in p53 null cells yet could be observed upon coexpression of p53 and N-JNK. The ability to alter the activity of ATF2, c-Jun, and p53 and the degree of stress-induced cell death by a JNK-derived fragment identifies new means to elucidate the nature of JNK regulation and to alter the cellular response to stress.

Major components within the MAPK family are extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK/JNK), and p38 (5.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, 6.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Whereas ERKs are preferentially activated by mitogens (7.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), the JNK and p38 pathways are triggered primarily by inflammatory cytokines and by a diverse array of cellular stresses, including UV light and hydrogen peroxide (9.Dérijard B.

Each of the stress kinases is activated by a defined set of upstream protein kinases, which are selectively triggered by signals elicited from either cell surface receptors, membrane-anchored proteins, or via changes due to an altered balance of reactive oxygen species (13.Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 14.Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell Signalling. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Regulation of stress kinases also involves scaffold proteins, which facilitate signal transfer among specific upstream and downstream components of the same signaling family (15.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cysteine-rich proteins inhibit the activity of stress kinases under nonstressed normal growing conditions (13.Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). MAPKs phosphorylate proteins located at the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus (16.Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In nonstimulated cells, MAPK are largely cytoplasmic.

One of the modes of activation is dimerization, which was shown for ERK2. Whereas ERK2 is found as a monomer in resting cells, ERK2 exists primarily as a dimer in stimulated cells (39.Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Based on their structural homology, p38 and JNK/SAPK may also form homodimers. Although heterodimerization between different MAPK family members is unlikely, based on structural data (40.Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J.

Chimeric p38-p44ERK was able to transduce stress and growth factor signals via a 40-amino acid fragment located within the amino-terminal region of p38, which determines the specificity of response to extracellular signals. However, the p44 (portion of the) chimera redirected stress signals into early mitogenic responses (44.Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ERK5/ERK2 chimeras served to identify c-Myc as one of the ERK5 substrates with V12 H-Ras acting as its upstream regulator (45.English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A JNKK2-JNK1 chimera renders JNK a constitutively active kinase in nonstressed cells (46.Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In normal growing cells, JNK activity is limited due to the inhibitory effect of GSTpi (47.Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, JNK efficiently targets the ubiquitination and degradation of its associated proteins, as demonstrated for c-Jun, ATF2, and p53 (48.Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L.R. Davis R. Ronai Z.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unlike ERKs, which are the best studied MAPKs, the nature of JNK domains and their respective functions remain unclear. As an approach to elucidate the nature of JNK domains involved in targeting ubiquitination and kinase activities, we have monitored the cellular changes elicited by a 206-amino acid amino-terminal fragment of JNK (N-JNK). This fragment contains the kinase domain and, based on its homology with ERK2, is expected to mediate association with JNK substrates. Furthermore, due to the lack of a carboxyl-terminal domain, N-JNK is not expected to be subject to intramolecular inhibition, which is a common mode of regulation for stress kinases (59.Barila D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). By analogy to ERK2, dimerization of JNK molecules may be impaired upon expression of N-JNK. Two-hybrid screening using the amino-terminal domain of JNK as bait has identified multiple clones that possess the carboxyl-terminal domain of JNK, thereby indicating association between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of this protein. 2A. Bhoumik, L. Broday, S. Fuchs, and Z. Ronai, unpublished observations. This result suggests that JNK may be found either as a dimer or that JNK may exhibit intramolecular inhibition in which the carboxyl-terminal region loops back onto the amino-terminal domain. Either possibility was shown to exist for other MAPK family members (39.Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), and is expected to play an important role in the regulation of JNK activities. Using a tetracycline (tet)-off-inducible system we demonstrate the effect of N-JNK on its substrates (c-Jun, ATF2, and p53) under normal growing conditions and after exposure to external stress. The nature of N-JNK effects before and after stress and the possible use of N-JNK to further elucidate the regulation of JNK activities are discussed. The mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 cells that stably express the pSV40-Hyg plasmid (CLONTECH) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The pTet-N-JNK was constructed by subcloning the cDNA of the amino-terminal 206 amino acids of wild type JNK1 into the tet-regulated promoter of the pUHD-10-3 vector. Cell clones that stably express both constructs were selected in 600 μg/ml geneticin in the presence of hygromycin (100 μg/ml) 24 h after DOTAP transfection with the ptet-N-JNK-UHD-10-3 construct. Cells inducible with N-JNK-tet were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%), hygromycin (100 μg/ml), and geneticin (400 μg/ml). To maintain suppression of N-JNK expression, tet was added to the medium every 3 days (to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml). Proteins were prepared from cells as described previously (60.Adler V. Fuchs S.Y. Kim J. Kraft A. King M.P. Pelling J. Ronai Z. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1437-1446PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, buffer contained a mixture of proteases (1 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and the phosphatase inhibitors (sodium vanadate 1 mm; sodium fluoride 5 mm). Antibodies to c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun, ATF-2, phospho-ATF-2, and phospho-JNK were purchased from New England BioLabs. Polyclonal antibodies to JNK or p53 were generated using bacterially expressed JNK or p53 as antigen. Monoclonal JNK antibodies (clone 333) (PharMingen) and monoclonal antibodies to p53, clone pAb421 (Oncogene Science) were purchased. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using 1 mg of whole cell extracts (WCE) and 2 μg of the respective antibodies, for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein G beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added (15 μl) for 30 min at room temperature before washes were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline/0.5 m LiCl supplemented with Tween 100 (0.5%). Immunoprecipitated material was subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was performed using 100 μg of WCE separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by electrotransfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Ponceau staining was carried out to confirm equal loading followed by blocking (5% non-fat milk) and reaction with the respective antibodies. Reactions were visualized using chemiluminesence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected cells in the growing phase were treated for 1 h with 100 μmH2O2 by taking the medium from the culture dish and mixing it with freshly diluted H2O2. Medium containing H2O2 was immediately applied to the fibroblasts (107 cells). Protein kinase assays were carried out using fusion proteins, GST-Jun or GST-ATF-2 (60.Adler V. Fuchs S.Y. Kim J. Kraft A. King M.P. Pelling J. Ronai Z. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1437-1446PubMed Google Scholar), as substrates. Purity of bacterially produced c-Jun and ATF-2 was confirmedvia silver-stained SDS-PAGE. Immunokinase reactions were carried out on immunoprecipitated kinase using antibodies to JNK, which was then incubated with the respective substrate, in a soluble form, in the presence of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mmNaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 50 mm NaCl) at 37 °C for 15 min. The protein G beads were pelleted and washed extensively with PBST (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-MeOH, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm benzamidine) before they were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (50 cpm/fmol) in the presence of kinase buffer. Following extensive washing, the phosphorylated substrate was boiled in SDS sample buffer and the eluted proteins were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, and phosphorylation of the c-Jun or ATF-2 substrate was determined by autoradiography. In all cases the buffers used contained a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10.Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L.R. Ronai Z. J. Biol.

The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 8 m urea in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The beads were washed, and the protein moiety was eluted and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose filters. Nitrocellulose filters were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and probed with HA11 antibody (BabCo). Respective luciferase constructs were cotransfected with βGal vector controlled by the same promoter. Transcriptional analysis was carried out on proteins prepared at time points indicated under “Results.” Transcriptional analysis of Jun/ATF2 was carried out using the 5xJun2 or AP1-driven luciferase construct as previously reported (61.van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Analysis of p53 transcription was carried out using the p21-luc construct. In all cases, values were normalized with respect to transfection efficiency based on levels of βGal activities. Data shown represent three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Analysis of cell death was carried out as described by Kumar et al. (62.Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Briefly, triplicates of >5,000 cells per measurement, at the time points indicated under “Results,” were subjected to trypan blue as a vital stain which identifies dead cells. In all cases, analysis was performed at least three times. Analysis of cell death in transfected 10.1 cells (constructs: p53-HA in pcDNA3; JNK1–206 in pcDNA3) was carried out using PI staining. Flow cytometric analysis (20,000 cells per assay) was performed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; Calibur flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson). Data analysis was carried out using the FACS Desk software. To elucidate the possible contribution of JNK domains to its cellular activities, we analyzed the effects of a JNK fragment, which represents the amino-terminal portion (amino acids 1–206) of JNK (N-JNK), and includes the kinase domain. The N-JNK fragment was cloned into the tet-off-inducible expression vector, which was transfected into mouse fibroblasts. Following drug selection, we identified cell clones in which expression of amino-terminal JNK is induced upon tetracycline removal. Immunoblot analysis allows detection of N-JNK expression as early as 1 h after tet removal followed by a time-dependent increase, which reaches its maximal expression levels after 12 h (Fig.1 a). Expression of N-JNK increased the level of endogenous JNK expression (compare time 0 intet− versus tet+ in Fig.1 b) but not the degree of JNK phosphorylation (Fig.1 b). Expression of N-JNK did not cause major changes in JNK expression and activity following exposure to H2O2 (Fig. 1 b). To test the effect of the N-JNK fragment on JNK substrates, we first monitored changes in the expression, phosphorylation, and activity of c-Jun and ATF2. Under nonstressed growth conditions, expression of N-JNK led to increased expression of c-Jun (4-fold; compare time 0 in tet− and tet+ lanes of Fig. 2 a,upper panel) and ATF2 (2-fold; Fig. 2 b,upper panel) based on densitometric analysis of three experiments. Increased expression of N-JNK also caused elevated basal phosphorylation levels of c-Jun (23-fold) and ATF2 (40-fold) (Fig.2 a, compare time 0 in tet+ with tet− lanes). Because JNK targets the ubiquitination of nonphosphorylated forms of its associated proteins (48.Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L.R. Davis R. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1529-1533Google Scholar), elevated phosphorylation is expected to confer respective increases in the expression levels of this protein. Next, we assessed the changes in the expression and activities of c-Jun and ATF2 in cells exposed to stress, using hydrogen peroxide as a model. Treatment with H2O2 increased phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2. Although phosphorylation of c-Jun was 9-fold higher 1 h after H2O2treatment, it was otherwise similar to that seen in the absence of N-JNK expression. Duration of ATF2 phosphorylation is shorter upon N-JNK expression, because ATF2 phosphorylation is three times lower 4 h after H2O2 treatment (Fig.2 b, compare tet+ and tet− lanes at the 4-h time point). These data suggest that the effects of N-JNK are more pronounced in nonstressed cells where N-JNK increases expression and phosphorylation levels of both ATF2 and c-Jun. Importantly, immunoprecipitation of N-JNK using HA antibodies from hydrogen peroxide tet− cells followed by solid phase kinase reaction using GST-Jun as a substrate did not reveal Jun phosphorylation, whereas immunoprecipitation using antibodies to JNK (allowing detection of endogenous JNK activity) as a positive control revealed such activity (data not shown). This observation suggests that, although the N-JNK fragment contains the kinase domain, it does not elicit kinase activities. To test whether N-JNK expression would alter transcriptional activity of Jun/ATF2, cells were transfected with Jun2-Luciferase or AP1-Luciferase constructs, which contain the target sequence for Jun/ATF2 or c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, respectively. Expression of N-JNK caused a modest decrease (25%) in AP1-Luc activity (time 0 in Fig.2 c), and it increased (33%) activity of Jun2-Luc (Fig.2 d). Within 4 h after H2O2treatment, there was a noticeable increase in both AP1-Luc (70%) and Jun2-Luc (110%) activities. Removal of tet−, which enables the expression of N-JNK in hydrogen peroxide-treated cells, caused a delayed and a modest increase (40%) in AP1-Luc activities after 4 h (Fig. 2 c). Furthermore, at this time point after treatment with hydrogen peroxide, the degree of AP1-driven transcription was 30% lower than the level seen in cells that do not express N-JNK (Fig.2 c). This observation suggests that expression of N-JNK attenuates the degree of AP1-mediated transcription under conditions that are known to increase c-Jun phosphorylation and transactivation. Analysis of Jun2-Luc activities in hydrogen peroxide treated cells revealed a 2-fold increase within the first 4 h, which was also attenuated in the presence of N-JNK expression. In fact, N-JNK-expressing cells maintained the same level of transactivation seen under nonstressed conditions, which was 30% higher than the basal levels of Jun2-Luc activity (Fig. 2 d). This result indicates that, in N-JNK-expressing cells, activities of c-Jun and ATF2 are limited following exposure to stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide. Such change is expected to alter the cellular response to stress and damage. To test whether N-JNK associates with c-Jun or ATF2, proteins prepared from control or hydrogen peroxide-treated cells that were maintained in the presence or absence of tet were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies to HA (which recognizes the HA-tagged N-JNK) followed by immunoblot using antibodies to either c-Jun or ATF2. This analysis did not identify association between ATF2 or c-Jun and N-JNK (Fig.2 e). To further explore cellular effects of the amino-terminal JNK fragment, we elucid"

We previously showed that RNA helicase A functionally interacts with CTE and contains a bidirectional nuclear transport domain at the carboxyl terminus.

These transcripts serve as templates for the synthesis of a subset of viral proteins and as genomes for progeny viral particles. The complex retroviruses, exemplified by human immunodeficiency virus type 1, employ a special, virally encoded protein to mediate this export process (for a recent review, see Ref. 1.Hope T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 binds to its cognate viral RNA response element, RRE, and the export receptor CRM-1 to form an active export complex (2.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). In contrast, the simian type D retroviruses do not encode a Rev-like protein but rather act through a cis-acting RNA element termed the constitutive transport element (CTE)1 (3.Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.T. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 4.Zolotukhin A.S. Valentin A. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7944-7952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CTE is functionally equivalent to the Rev/RRE of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. However, the export receptor for CTE is not known. We recently showed that RNA helicase A (RHA) specifically binds to functional CTE RNA (5.Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and is required for CTE activity (6.Li J. Tang H. Mullen T. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RHA was identified previously as a nuclear protein capable of unwinding RNA duplexes in an ATP-dependent manner (7.Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4398-4407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first observed that RHA shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm despite its predominant nuclear localization at steady state (5.Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and subsequently mapped a bidirectional nuclear transport domain at the carboxyl terminus (CTD) of the protein (8.Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A second CTE-binding protein, TAP, has also been identified and implicated in CTE-mediated RNA nuclear export and gene expression (9.Gruter P. Tabernero C. Von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 10.Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The evidence that RHA plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression prompted us to search for RHA-interacting proteins that might also be involved in this process. Here we report the isolation of a novel human protein, named helicase A-binding protein 95 (HAP95), found by virtue of its binding to the CTD of RHA in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human cDNA library. HAP95 has extensive homology with AKAP95, a member of the A-kinase-anchoring protein family. However, HAP95 lacks the characteristic protein kinase A binding domain of this family. Further analyses confirmed the specific interaction between RHA and HAP95 in vivo and in vitro and between HAP95 and CTE RNA in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrated that HAP95 is a shuttle protein, and overexpression of HAP95 specifically enhances CTE-mediated gene expression. The sequence corresponding to the CTD of RHA (nt 1150–1259) was amplified with PCR and cloned into the vector pGBT9, in phase with the DNA binding domain of the yeastGAL4 gene. This vector was transformed into the yeast strain HF7C along with the human leukocyte cDNA library contained in theGAL4 activation domain-expressing plasmid, pGAD10, as described previously (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Isolation, verification, and identification of plasmid clones that code for RHA-binding protein peptides was done as described previously (11.Reddy T.R. Tang H. Li X. Wong-Staal F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2785-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A cDNA library carried in λ phage (λgt11 from CLONTECH, human T cell lymphoma cell line, HL1068b) was plated with theEscherichia coli host strain Y1090, and nitrocellulose filter lifts (NitroBind, Micron Separations, Inc.) were made. For hybridization to these filters, a probe was created via random primed oligonucleotide synthesis (Roche Molecular Biochemicals kit) using PCR-amplified cDNA sequence from the yeast two-hybrid assay positive clone pGAD10–35 and [32P]dCTP. Positive plaques were identified through autoradiography and were isolated from primary screening plates. Two additional rounds of plating and filter hybridization were done to ensure clonality of the isolated phage. Phage DNA was isolated from large scale cultures with a Qiagen λ phage DNA purification kit and cDNA sequences were PCR-amplified from these DNA samples. Additional sequence was also obtained via PCR amplification of a human phagemid cDNA library with sequence-specific primers and high fidelity Taq polymerase from the Qiagen Hot Star kit. Sequences from the λ and phagemid libraries were cloned into carrier plasmids (pCDNA3 and pGEM-T-Easy, respectively), sequenced and later assembled into one continuous coding sequence in pCDNA3. HeLa and 293T cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Total RNA was prepared from tissue culture cells (grown under the conditions described above) with TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as instructed by manufacturer and blotted onto a Genescreen Plus membrane after size resolution on a denaturing agarose gel. Probe was prepared from clone 35 as above and hybridized to membrane as described previously (12.Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 7.37, 7.39, 7.52, 16.59, and 16.63, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Epithelium-derived cell lines used were HeLa/CD4 (surface marker CD4-expressing HeLa), 293, 293T (293 cells that express large T antigen of SV40), SK-n-sh, NT2, and SW13; lymphoblast-derived cell lines were H9 and Molt 4/8; the monocyte-derived cell line was U-937. The plasmid pGEX-4T-RHA-CTD, encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, was transformed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS following induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 28 °C overnight. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified by incubating the bacterial extracts in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were then pelleted, washed five times with ice-cold buffer A, and suspended in 1 ml of buffer A. The bound GST fusion proteins were eluted by boiling for 3 min in SDS-buffer and examined by 5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to determine purity. [35S]Methionine-labeled HAP95 and Luciferase were synthesized by using the TNT T7/SP6 wheat germ extract-coupled system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For in vitro protein-protein interaction studies, an equal amount of the in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled HAP95 was incubated with 5 μg of purified GST-RHA-CTD fusion protein or GST alone (as a negative control) that was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads at 25 °C for 1 h in 250 μl of buffer A. The beads were then washed by resuspension and centrifugation five times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with an equal volume of SDS loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, resolved by 5–20% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. After transfection, HeLa cells were cultured for 24 h and then harvested. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in 350 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 murine monoclonal antibody (Stratagene) or control mouse anti-GST monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C and then with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h. The beads were washed six times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with an equal volume of SDS loading buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Using anti-RHA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Western blot analysis was carried out. The blot was stripped off the bound antibody and reprobed with anti-Sam68 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing CTE RNA or its antisense sequence along with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged HAP95 or Myc-tagged TAP (control). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated on ice with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 units/ml RNasin (Promega)). Supernatants were rotated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit serum-agarose (Sigma) and then rotated overnight at 4 °C with Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in addition to either anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Stratagene) or anti-Myc antibody (Babco). After washing with lysis buffer, RNA was isolated from the beads with RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I. RT-PCRs (Superscript One-step system, Life Technologies, Inc.) were done with CTE-specific primers and were followed by PCRs with the same primers. HeLa cells were cultured in four-well chamber slides and transfected with plasmids expressing pFLAG-HAP95 fusion protein using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). After 24 h, cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilizaed by 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid pGFP-HAP95 expressing the HAP95 protein fused to green fluorescence protein. The formation of heterokaryons from NIH3T3 and HeLa cells as well as subsequent cycloheximide treatment, cell fusion, fixation, and staining, were done as described previously (8.Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13.Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected via the calcium chloride precipitate method. Plasmids containing the CAT gene along with either CTE or RRE within splice donor sites (pDM138-CTE and pDM128) were transfected (5.Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The expression vector for HAP95 was also transfected in some experiments. Transfections with the RRE-CAT reporter were done with Rev expression plasmid. To test the effects of HAP95 on gene expression that is not dependent on retroviral elements, the plasmid pCAT-3 control (Promega) was also used. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid was used as an internal control of transfection efficiency. Leptomycin B (4 nm) was used in some experiments. Transfected cells were washed with 1× PBS and fed fresh medium after 12 h. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Cell extracts were prepared and tested for CAT activity through standard assay procedures as described previously (12.Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 7.37, 7.39, 7.52, 16.59, and 16.63, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). To identify proteins that could potentially interact with RHA in vivo and play a role in nuclear export, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a human leukocyte cDNA library, using the carboxyl terminus of RHA as bait. After several rounds of transformant screening, seven independent clones identifying six different putative RHA binding proteins were identified. Two of these had no significant homology with characterized proteins in the GenBankTM data base. One of these novel clones, number 35, had a contiguous open reading frame of 893 nt throughout the cDNA segment of the plasmid. We concluded that this sequence probably represents the internal coding sequence of a larger gene. Additional sequences at both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene were obtained by screening a λgt11 phage library with a radioactive probe derived from clone 35 cDNA. About 1 kilobase of sequences were obtained 5′ of clone 35 cDNA, but these constituted mostly untranslated sequences. The 180 nucleotides 3′ of clone 35 cDNA extend the open reading frame but still did not contain any termination codons. For the remaining 3′ coding sequence, we fortuitously found a GenBankTM entry of a 983-nt sequence (GenBankTMaccession no. AF053536), the first 257 nt of which were an exact match to the last 257 nt of the 3′ λ cDNA clone. This entry was subsequently retracted, but nonetheless, based on its information, we were able to construct a 3′-specific primer to amplify our target sequence from a phagemid library. Amplification with nested primers and sequencing were used to confirm the identity of the amplified sequence. The coding sequences from the two λ clones and the amplified sequence from the phagemid library were assembled into a single gene (Fig.1 A) and cloned into pcDNA3. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed in-frame stop codons in the 5′-untranslated region followed by two potential initiating ATG codons. Comparison of coupled in vitrotranscription/translation products from intact and truncated constructs identified the second ATG as the true initiating codon (data not shown). These data predict a 72-kDa, 646-amino acid protein, but its migration on SDS-PAGE yielded an apparent size of approximately 100 kDa (data not shown). Search of the GenBankTM data base revealed a high degree of homology between the novel protein and AKAP95, a member of the A-kinase-anchoring protein family (14.Eide T. Coghlan V. Orstavik S. Holsve C. Solberg R. Skalhegg B.S. Lamb N.J.C. Langeberg L. Fernandez A. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In deference to this homology, we dubbed the novel protein HAP95 (helicase A-binding protein 95) (GenBankTM accession no. AF199414). The homology between HAP95 and AKAP95 is distributed in two distinct areas, one of which contains two zinc-finger DNA binding motifs (Fig.1 B). However, it should be noted that HAP95 is not a member of the AKAP family, since it lacks the characteristic amphipathic peptide region responsible for binding to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. There are several interesting motifs in the nonhomologous regions that are unique to HAP95: both tandem and nontandem repeats of the YG dipeptide sequence in the amino terminus, three FG repeats and a classical nuclear localization signal in the middle of the protein, and two proline-rich regions at the carboxyl terminus that fit the consensus for an SH3 binding domain (15.Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A Northern blot of RNA from various human cell lines with a HAP95 cDNA probe revealed ubiquitous expression of two mRNA species of 2.0 and 4.0 kilobases, respectively (Fig.2). The carboxyl terminus of RHA (RHA-CTD) was expressed as a GST-tagged fusion protein. The purified GST-RHA-CTD fusion protein, bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, was incubated with 35S-labeled HAP95 or luciferase (control) and washed extensively, and the eluted material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.3 A, HAP95 interacted strongly with RHA (lane 3). This binding appears to be specific, since no interaction was seen between HAP95 and the GST moiety alone (lane 2) or between luciferase and GST-RHA-CTD or GST (lanes 5 and 6) In order to examine whether RHA binds to HAP95 in vivo, HeLa cells were transfected with either the plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged HAP95 (pFLAG-HAP95) or the pFLAG vector. Cell extracts from these transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with either murine monoclonal anti-FLAG or anti-GST antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-RHA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 B, RHA was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-HAP95 by anti-FLAG antibodies in the transfected cells (lane 5). Immunoprecipitates made with a control anti-GST antibody did not demonstrate a strong immunoreactive RHA band (lane 3), and no RHA bands were seen in immunoprecipitates made from cells overexpressing the FLAG epitope by itself (lanes 2 and4). Preliminary data indicate that HAP95 did not bind to TAP or to Sam68, two other RNA binding proteins involved in post-transcriptional regulation of retroviral mRNA (16.Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17.Reddy T.R. Xu W. Mau J.K.L. Goodwin C.D. Suhasini M. Tang H. Frimpong K. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To demonstrate the interaction of CTE RNA and HAP95 in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids that express RNA containing the CTE sequence or its antisense, along with pFLAG-HAP95 or Myc-tagged TAP, a known CTE-binding protein. The tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by virtue of their peptide tags, and the presence of CTE or antisense CTE RNA was verified by RT-PCR and subsequent PCR amplification with CTE-specific primers. As shown in Fig.4, CTE RNA, but not the antisense sequence, immunoprecipitated with HAP95 and TAP. As a control, RT-PCR was performed on total RNA without immunoprecipitation from transfected cells, which verified that both CTE constructs are expressed in similar amounts in vivo (data not shown). To elucidate the subcellular localization of HAP95, we transfected HeLa cells with pFLAG-HAP95. Staining with the anti-FLAG antibodies revealed the fusion protein to be localized within the nucleoplasmic region as well as concentrated in punctate loci in the nucleus but excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 5 A). Heterokaryon assays were then performed to determine if HAP95 is able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid (pGFP-HAP95) expressing HAP95 fused to green fluorescent protein. After 24 h, protein synthesis was halted by treatment with cycloheximide, and the cells were fused to NIH-3T3 to form interspecies heterokaryons as described previously (8.Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13.Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Three hours after fusion, cells were fixed and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The mouse nuclei were distinguished from human nuclei by punctate staining with Hoechst 33258. Green fluorescence was observed in both human and mouse nuclei within the same heterokaryons, demonstrating that HAP95 had been exported from the HeLa cell nuclei and imported into the NIH-3T3 cell nuclei (Fig. 5 B). Thus, HAP95 is primarily localized to the nucleus at steady state but is able to continuously shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To examine whether HAP95 may play a role in the regulation of CTE-mediated gene expression, we co-transfected 293T cells with a variety of CAT reporter constructs and an expression vector for HAP95. Overexpression of HAP95 exerted a 3–4-fold increase over basal CAT activity from pDM138-CTE, a CTE-dependent CAT reporter vector, while no effect was observed on pCAT or RRE-CAT in the presence of Rev (Fig. 6 A). AKAP95 did not show any activity (data not shown). Additional negative controls include human immunodeficiency virus LTR-CAT and CRE (cyclic AMP-responsive element)-CAT (data not shown). The up-regulation of CTE-dependent gene expression by HAP95 was dose-dependent (data not shown). Like the basal CTE-CAT activity, activation of CTE-CAT by HAP95 was not inhibited by leptomycin B, in contrast to Rev-mediated transactivation of RRE-CAT (Fig. 6 B). Retroviruses utilize at least two distinct pathways to export unspliced mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The complex retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, encode a viral protein Rev, which acts as an adaptor between the RRE RNA element and the export receptor, CRM1 (2.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 18.Farjot G. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17309-17317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, simian type D retroviruses utilize a cis-acting constitutive transport element (CTE), which presumably interacts directly with cellular export proteins (3.Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.T. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar,4.Zolotukhin A.S. Valentin A. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7944-7952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The export receptor for this pathway is not known, but it is distinct from CRM-1. Two CTE-binding cellular proteins have been identified. TAP, the human homolog of the yeast protein Mex67, was shown to bind specifically to CTE and enhance nuclear export of CTE in the Xenopus oocyte system (9.Gruter P. Tabernero C. Von Kobbe C.

This is consistent with the findings that Mex67 is involved in yeast mRNA nuclear export (19.Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cel. Bio. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,20.Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luehrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TAP was recently shown to be able to partially rescue CTE function in nonpermissive cell lines (10.Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16.Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our laboratory reported that RHA binds specifically to functional CTE (5.Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and antibodies to RHA strongly inhibited CTE activity when microinjected into cell nuclei (6.Li J. Tang H. Mullen T. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We further showed that RHA is a nuclear shuttle protein, with overlapping import and export signals localized to the CTD. The export function of RHA is also independent of CRM-1 (8.Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), consistent with the hypothesis that RHA may play a role in CTE export. Interestingly, RHA also seems to be involved in RRE-mediated gene expression at a step upstream of export (6.Li J. Tang H. Mullen T. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify other cellular proteins that may be involved in CTE export and/or function, we searched for proteins that bind RHA, initially using the yeast two-hybrid screening assay. We used only the CTD of RHA instead of the entire 140-kDa protein as a bait, since this region contains the bidirectional nuclear transport domain. Here we report the identification of a novel protein, HAP95, which was confirmed to bind RHA both in vivo and in vitro. HAP95 does not bind to TAP, the other CTE-binding protein. Interestingly, HAP95 shows significant homology to AKAP95, a member of the A-kinase-anchoring protein family. The AKAP family proteins bind the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) and localize PKA to various distinct locations and structures within cells. This subcellular localization is believed to be crucial for the appropriate function of PKA in cellular signaling pathways. The binding of PKA regulatory subunits is mediated by a characteristic amphipathic helix in AKAP (reviewed in Ref. 21.Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). AKAP95, specifically, binds the RIIα subunit of PKA with high affinity (22.Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this amphipathic peptide region, it also contains two zinc finger DNA-binding domains in its carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. Alignment of HAP95 to AKAP95 revealed two regions of homology separated by nonhomologous sequences. The homologous region closer to the amino terminus (residues 91–232 of HAP95, 31% identity and 47% similarity with AKAP95) has no defined function. The second homologous region (residues 385–547 of HAP1, 51% identity and 71% similarity with AKAP95) contains the two zinc finger DNA-binding motifs. Notably, the amphipathic helix in AKAP95 responsible for binding to the RIIα subunit of PKA is absent in HAP95. Thus, HAP95 by definition is not a member of the AKAP family. Conversely, HAP95 has several features not found in AKAP95. At the amino terminus, there is a region with many YG dipeptide motifs of unknown significance. The central region of the protein contains a basic stretch that could serve as a nuclear localization signal as well as an RNA binding domain. There are also three nucleoporin-like FG repeats in this region (23.Rout M.P. Wente S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 357-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus is rich in acidic residues and contains two proline-rich domains that fit the consensus for SH3 binding domains (15.Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Search of the EST data base uncovered sequences derived from HAP95. Interestingly, HAP95 and AKAP95 appear to both reside on human chromosome 19 (GenBankTM accession numbers AC005785 and AC006128), suggesting that HAP95 could have arisen from AKAP95 through gene duplication. Using a heterokaryon assay, we found that a GFP-HAP95 fusion protein is able to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm although its steady state localization is predominantly found in the nucleus. It is not clear whether HAP95 shuttling is dependent on its binding to RHA orvice versa. More importantly, we showed that HAP95 is a positive co-factor for CTE function. Overexpression of HAP95 significantly increased CTE activity in transfected 293T cells. We demonstrated that HAP95 binds CTE RNA in vivo, although this may be mediated by an intermediate protein or complex, most likely involving RHA. We recently observed that RHA and TAP also directly interact with each other. 2H. Tang and F. Wong-Staal, submitted for publication. The actual mechanisms by which RHA, HAP95, and TAP interact to mediate CTE export and expression remain to be elucidated. While this manuscript was in press, Orstaviket al. (24.Orstavik S. Eide T.

The x-ray structure of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Fe-hydrogenase has recently been solved, but structural information on the recognition of its redox partners is essential to understand the structure-function relationships of the enzyme. In the present work, we have obtained a structural model of the complex of Fe-hydrogenase with its redox partner, the cytochrome c 553, combining docking calculations and NMR experiments. The putative models of the complex demonstrate that the small subunit of the hydrogenase has an important role in the complex formation with the redox partner; 50% of the interacting site on the hydrogenase involves the small subunit. The closest contact between the redox centers is observed between Cys-38, a ligand of the distal cluster of the hydrogenase and Cys-10, a ligand of the heme in the cytochrome. The electron pathway from the distal cluster of the Fe-hydrogenase to the heme of cytochromec 553 was investigated using the software Greenpath and indicates that the observed cysteine/cysteine contact has an essential role. The spatial arrangement of the residues on the interface of the complex is very similar to that already described in the ferredoxin-cytochrome c 553 complex, which therefore, is a very good model for the interacting domain of the Fe-hydrogenase-cytochrome c 553.

The Sulfate-reducing Bacteria, 2nd Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1984Google Scholar). These microorganisms couple energy generation to the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate via electron transfer-linked phosphorylation (2Peck Jr., H.D. Odom J.M. Singleton Jr., R. The Sulfate-reducing Bacteria: Contemporary Perspectives. Springer, Berlin1993: 41-76Google Scholar). Dissimilatory sulfate reduction with hydrogen is a transmembrane redox process in which H2oxidation and sulfate reduction take place on opposite sides of the cytoplasmic membrane (3Badziong W. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 125: 167-174Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sulfate-reducing bacteria have been investigated for many years as a model for respiratory electron transfer chains. The structures of many compounds in this system have been obtained using x-ray crystallography. Among these metalloproteins, the structurally unrelated NiFe- and Fe-hydrogenases (4Fauque G. Peck H.D. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. Berlier Y. Dervartanian D.V Texeira M. Pryzbyla A.E. Lespinat P.A. Moura I. LeGall J. FEMS Microbiol.

Biophys. Acta. 1980; 594: 105-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar):H2⇔2H++2e−Equation 1 Both enzymes are periplasmic and use c-type cytochromes as electron transfer partners (6Verhagen M.F. Wolbert R.B. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One of the oxidoreduction partners of Fe-hydrogenase is the periplasmic low potential cytochromec 553. The monohemic cytochromec 553 is homologous to mitochondrial cytochromes (7Blackledge M. Guerlesquin F. Marion D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The relative high exposure of the heme to the solvent is the structural parameter modulating the low oxidoreduction potential of this cytochrome (20 mV) (8Blackledge M. Medvedeva S. Poncin M. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. Marion D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 661-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments (6Verhagen M.F. Wolbert R.B. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have shown that cytochrome c 553 has a rather high affinity for hydrogenase (Km 46 μm) and that the electron transfer rate constant (k cat 710 s−1) is comparable to those generally reported in bimolecular electron transfer complexes. The x-ray structure of Fe-hydrogenase is essential in understanding the reactivity of the enzyme (9Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian C.E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). D. desulfuricans ATCC 7757 Fe-hydrogenase, which is identical to the homologous enzyme fromD. vulgaris on the basis of its amino acid sequence and spectroscopic properties (10Hatchikian E.C. Forget N. Fernandez V.M. Williams R. Cammack R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Hatchikian E.C. Magro V. Forget N. Nicolet Y. Fontecilla-Camps J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2947-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), comprises two different subunits of 42.5 and 11 kDa. The large subunit contains a ferredoxin-like domain composed of two [4Fe-4S] clusters and an unusual active Fe-S center, termed the H cluster. From x-ray studies, it has been shown that the H cluster is constituted of a typical [4Fe-4S] cubane bridged to a binuclear active site. The observed spatial arrangement of the three [4Fe-4S] clusters separated by center-to-center distances of 12 Å provides one plausible electron transfer pathway going from the buried binuclear active site to the distal [4Fe-4S] cluster located close to the molecular surface. Furthermore, the calculated electrostatic potential at the molecular surface surrounding the distal cluster is negative (9Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian C.E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that this region might be involved in electrostatic interactions with cytochromec 553 (see Fig. 1), which exhibits a high content of basic residues around the heme pocket (12Sebban-Kreuzer C. Blanchard L. Bersch B. Blackledge M.J. Marion D. Dolla A. Guerlesquin F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The mature small subunit, which is preceded by a N-terminal signal peptide, is probably involved in the export of the enzyme to the periplasm (11Hatchikian E.C. Magro V. Forget N. Nicolet Y. Fontecilla-Camps J.V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2947-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It shows an unusual topology, which sheds some light on the evolutionary pathway of Fe-hydrogenase. Indeed, this heterodimeric periplasmic enzyme is very similar to Clostridium pasteurianum Fe-hydrogenase and may have evolved from a common ancestral monomeric enzyme. However, the structural role of the small subunit in Fe-hydrogenase is not yet well understood. Although a wealth of biological and structural data have been gathered on Fe-hydrogenase and cytochromec 553, the various types of interaction involved in the recognition and the binding of the two electron transfer partners as well as the interacting molecular surfaces of both redox partners have not been investigated. Furthermore, the detailed mechanisms of intra- and intermolecular electron transfer between the two redox partners still require extensive research. In the present work, we develop a structural approach to study the cytochrome c 553-Fe-hydrogenase complex using protein docking calculations and heteronuclear NMR experiments. Docking algorithms are currently being developed for protein-ligand complex analysis. For protein-protein interactions the use of such algorithms is more difficult, and it is essential that experimental data be used to select the best model. We have recently described an experimentalab initio approach using the software BiGGER in which we have implemented an NMR filter (13Morelli X. Dolla A. Czjzek M. Palma P.N. Blasco F. Krippahl L. Moura J.J.G. Guerlesquin F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2530-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This approach developed for small complexes was carried out using heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiments. Recently, Pervushin et al. (14Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar) introduced transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY),1 in which constructive interference between dipolar relaxation and relaxation due to chemical shift anisotropy was exploited to reduce the line width in both dimensions in high magnetic fields. The method has clear advantages for structural investigation of high molecular weight complexes when compared with the regular heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiment. Therefore, we have carried out TROSY experiments on 15N-labeled cytochrome in the absence and presence of Fe-hydrogenase. On the basis of proton and nitrogen chemical shift variations, a mapping of the interacting site on the cytochrome has been obtained. These NMR data were used as a filter to choose the most accurate structure obtained from the ab initio docking solutions proposed by the software BiGGER (15Palma, P. N., Krippahl, L., Wampler, J. E., and Moura, J. J. G. (2000) Proteins Struct. Funcct. Genet., in pressGoogle Scholar). We have recently demonstrated (13Morelli X. Dolla A. Czjzek M. Palma P.N. Blasco F. Krippahl L. Moura J.J.G. Guerlesquin F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2530-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Morelli X. Guerlesquin F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that the use of NMR filters necessitates the labeling of both proteins so that NMR constraints are applied on both partners of the complex. In the present work, the labeling of hydrogenase is not possible because of the poor expression of the enzyme in the sulfate-reducing bacteria. Moreover, if 15N labeling allows structural studies of high molecular weight proteins, double labeling (15N and 13C) would be necessary here, to accomplish the full assignment of the Fe-hydrogenase. For this reason, we have first analyzed a complex where ferredoxin from Desulfomicrobium norvegicum was used as a model of the ferredoxin-like domain of the Fe-hydrogenase (16Morelli X. Guerlesquin F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have developed a new approach for high molecular weight complexes, where NMR constraints are only deduced from1H and 15N chemical shifts observed on the smaller, labeled protein. The similarities of the model complex and the physiological complex are analyzed. The cytochrome c 553 fromD. vulgaris Hildenborough was expressed and purified fromD. desulfuricans G200 as described previously (17Blanchard L. Marion D. Pollock B. Voordouw G. Wall J. Bruschi M. Guerlesquin F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).15N-Cytochrome c 553 was obtained as previously reported (16Morelli X. Guerlesquin F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and was concentrated in 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, on an Amicon microconcentrator (PM 3) to a 0.5 mm final concentration. D. desulfuricans ATCC 7757 hydrogenase was purified as reported by Hatchikian et al. (10Hatchikian E.C. Forget N. Fernandez V.M. Williams R. Cammack R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Hydrogenase was concentrated under argon atmosphere in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm), pH 7.0, on an Amicon microconcentrator (PM 30) to a 0.4 mm final concentration. NMR experiments were recorded with 0.1 mm cytochrome and 1 or 2 equivalents of hydrogenase. The two-dimensional [1H-15N]-TROSY pulse sequence uses single transition to single transition polarization transfer (18Pervushin K. Wider G. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) where it affords a 2 sensitivity enhancement for kinetically stable amide groups in proteins. NMR spectra were recorded at 296 K on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 spectrometer operating at 11.7 teslas, equipped with an HCN probe and self-shielded triple axis gradients. Spectra were acquired accumulating 32 scans per free induction decay. 128 complex points in F1 and 1K complex points in F2 were recorded. The spectral width was 6 and 2 KHz in F2 and F1, respectively. 1H chemical shifts were referenced with the H2O resonance calibrated at 4.792 ppm at 296 K.15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly by setting the zero point of the nitrogen frequency scale equal to 0.101329118 times the proton zero frequency (19Wishart D. Bigam C. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson J. Oldfield E. Markley J. Sykes B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). Processing and spectra analysis were done on Unix workstations using xwinnmr and Aurelia software provided by Bruker. The protein coordinates of D. vulgaris Hildenborough cytochrome c 553 and D. desulfuricans ATCC 7757 Fe-hydrogenase were obtained from the Protein Data Bank from file 1dvh and 1hfe, respectively. Molecular interaction simulations were performed using the docking program BiGGER (15Palma, P. N., Krippahl, L., Wampler, J. E., and Moura, J. J. G. (2000) Proteins Struct. Funcct. Genet., in pressGoogle Scholar). This algorithm performs a complete and systematic search in the binding space of both molecules. A population of 1000 candidate protein-protein-docked geometries is generated and selected, based on the geometric complementarity and amino acid pairwise affinities between the two molecular surfaces. In this process, the algorithm enables implicit treatment of molecular flexibility. In a subsequent step, the putative docked structures are ranked using an interaction scoring function, which combines several interaction terms that are thought to be relevant for the stabilization of protein complexes: geometric packing of the surfaces, explicit electrostatic interactions, desolvation energy, and pairwise propensities of the amino acid side chains to contact across the molecular interface. In the ab initiosimulations, the entire molecular surface was searched using absolutely no additional information regarding the binding sites. Chemical shift variations observed in TROSY experiments of cytochrome c 553 in the presence and absence of hydrogenase have been considered to be correlated to the complex formation. These variations were translated into distance parameters (an amide (NH) affected is within 4 Å of any atom belonging to the other protein). The 1000 solutions obtained using the program BiGGER were analyzed using these distance constraints. The solutions were then ranked according to the NMR constraint violations (Table I). The ab initio solution clustering was not necessary, because only two families of structures were obtained after the NMR ranking.Table IStructural comparison of the 10 final models of the cytochrome c553-hydrogenase complexSolution IDNMR restraintsDistance, heme/clusterInteracting surfaceEnergyÅÅ2kcal mol−1Fam1 solution 1613.00 (d)1-ad, distal [4Fe-4S] cluster; m, medial [4Fe-4S] cluster.2051.2−22842.8Fam1 solution 2613.02 (d)2126.6−22978.95Fam1 solution 3512.34 (d)2284.6−22811.5Fam1 solution 4512.35 (d)2070.05−23027.16Fam1 solution 5514.3 (d)2273.6−22846.56Fam2 solution 1618.07 (m)2247.76−22877.5Fam2 solution 2617.15 (m)2230.15−23043.5Fam2 solution 3521.49 (m)2817.34−22908.2Fam2 solution 4516.62 (m)2566.11−23010.54Fam2 solution 5516.24 (m)2286.6−22991.27The values indicated were obtained after energy minimization.1-a d, distal [4Fe-4S] cluster; m, medial [4Fe-4S] cluster. Open table in a new tab The values indicated were obtained after energy minimization. The 10 best structures of the complex, as obtained by the docking algorithm filtered by NMR data, were first minimized in a preparation step, using the conjugate gradient method by Powell (20Powell M.J.D. Math. Programming. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), with X-PLOR 3.851. Then a molecular dynamics calculation (AMBER force field) was performed on the selected complex structures with a heat bath temperature of 280 K and initial velocities from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 280 K (integration of the motion equations at 0.001-ps time steps). The SHAKE constraints (21Ryckaert J.-P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Phys. 1997; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17011) Google Scholar) were applied for all metal centers, i.e. the bi-atomic catalytic site, the Fe4S4 clusters of the hydrogenase, and the heme group of the cytochrome with a tolerance of 0.0004. The coordinates of the “best” structure (family 1 (fam1) solution 3) have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (code: 1e08). The software Greenpath (22Davidson V.L. Jones L.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8120-8125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was used to propose an electron transfer pathway from the electron donor (the hydrogenase distal cluster) to the electron acceptor (the cytochrome heme). Cytochrome c has been reported to present a strong dipolar moment induced by the high content of basic residues found around the heme pocket. These lysine residues have been demonstrated to be highly conserved in this class of proteins (7Blackledge M. Guerlesquin F. Marion D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Complex formation between cytochromec 553 and Fe-hydrogenase has been evaluated in terms of electrostatic interactions. The drastic effect of the ionic strength (0.5 m NaCl) on the kinetic measurements of cytochrome c 553 reduction by Fe-hydrogenase, which we have observed, establishes that electrostatic interactions are the driving force of the complex formation. Fig. 1 shows electrostatic isopotential curves for cytochrome c 553 and Fe-hydrogenase. The dipolar moment is easily observable for cytochromec 553, and three zones of various charges are observable for hydrogenase. The heme environment of cytochromec 553 and the H cluster environment of the Fe-hydrogenase are found to be positively charged, and the environment of one of the two clusters of the ferredoxin-like domain (the distal cluster) is negatively charged. Considering the electrostatic properties of the two molecules and the ionic strength dependence of the complex formation, one can expect that the distal cluster situated at the extreme end of the domain is the interacting site with cytochrome c 553. TROSY experiments have been recorded on 0.1 mm cytochromec 553 solution at 296 K (Fig.2). Out of the 78 amino acids, 58 NH groups were assigned. The mapping of the interacting site was obtained from the induced chemical shifts observed on the cytochromec 553 NH, in the presence of Fe-hydrogenase in the TROSY experiments (Fig.3 a). Nine NH groups undergo notable 15N chemical shift variations from 0.1 to 0.45 ppm and 1H from 0.015 to 0.06 ppm. Analysis of these chemical shifts gives the mapping of the interacting site on the cytochrome represented in Fig. 3 b. The interacting site on the cytochrome is the same with either ferredoxin (16Morelli X. Guerlesquin F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or hydrogenase, involving at least six conserved residues, i.e. 10, 14, 15, 16, 24, and 59.Figure 3A, 1H and 15N chemical shift variations of cytochrome c 553 NH groups observed in TROSY experiments.

In the top figure, the heme is colored in red, the NH groups whose resonances undergo chemical shift variations are in green, unassigned residues are in blue, and unaffected residues are in white.

These structures were first evaluated and ranked by an ab initio procedure, which uses an interaction score function (Fig.4 A). The next step was to use the NMR filter, explained above, in order to rule out solutions incompatible with the NMR data and to retain a reduced population of plausible structures (Fig. 4 B). Eight NH groups of the residues affected by the complex formation were used as a filter for the docking solutions, i.e. 5, 10, 14, 15, 16, 24, 32, 54 and 59. This procedure eliminates the set of solutions in which the cytochrome would bind at the second negatively charged region on the hydrogenase (solutions on the lower left of Fig.4 A). The remaining solutions were ranked according to the level of agreement with the NMR constraints. The 50 top solutions (with fewer than three constraints violated out of eight) involve the binding of the cytochrome at two distinct sites in the surface of the hydrogenase (Fig. 4 B). Each site involves, respectively, the distal and the medial cluster of the ferredoxin-like domain of hydrogenase and corresponds to family1 and family2 solutions. However, it has been reported that the hydrogenase-cytochromec 553 complex has a 1:1 stoichiometry (6Verhagen M.F. Wolbert R.B. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), so only one of these two families of solutions is relevant. At this level, a reciprocal mapping of the interacting site on labeled hydrogenase would be helpful, but unfortunately, due to the poor expression of Fe-hydrogenase in sulfate-reducing bacteria, to date, it is not possible to carry out the labeling of Fe-hydrogenase. Therefore, we did not discard any of these two families at this stage of the analysis. Of the 50 best solutions, 10 models have a heme/cluster distance smaller than 20 Å. Considering that a maximum distance of 20 Å is necessary for an effective electron transfer, the 10 resulting solutions were energy-minimized. These 10 solutions are equally distributed in two families (fam1 and fam2) and are numbered according to the related family (Table I). All 10 solutions were minimized using X-PLOR, and a molecular dynamics calculation was performed to optimize side chain conformations and interactions on the interface. The resulting properties of the complexes after minimization are reported in Table I. The results indicate that the five solutions close to the distal cluster (fam1) can be grouped in a unique solution after minimization. The optimal distances between the distal cluster and the heme for these five solutions range from 12.3 to 14.3 Å, and the final energy level varies by less than 0.5%. The solutions on the opposite side of the ferredoxin-like domain of the hydrogenase, closest to the medial cluster (fam2), represents five different solutions, because the orientations vary by more than 20° and different residues are involved in intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the optimal distances obtained after minimization between the medial cluster and the heme group are clearly less favorable than the solutions of fam1, which bring the distal cluster closest to the heme of cytochromec 553. Therefore, we propose that the electron transfer involves the distal cluster as the direct interaction site with the cytochrome (fam1). Within fam1, analysis of the five solutions involving the distal cluster indicates that it is the same region with small modifications of interacting residues that forms the interface. The choice of one representative structure was made with respect to the results of site-directed mutagenesis obtained on cytochromec 553. We have already suggested that Lys-63 and Tyr-64 are essential for electron transfer with the redox partner (12Sebban-Kreuzer C. Blanchard L. Bersch B. Blackledge M.J. Marion D. Dolla A. Guerlesquin F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,23Sebban-Kreuzer C. Blackledge M. Dolla A. Marion D. Guerlesquin F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8331-8340Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data, fam1 solution 3 seemed to be the best representative structure. The model, corresponding to fam1 solution 3 of the cytochromec 553-hydrogenase complex, is presented in Fig.5. The interacting domain is very similar to the model proposed for the ferredoxin-cytochromec 553 complex. This is not surprising, considering that the root mean square distance between the ferredoxin-like domain of Fe-hydrogenase and the ferredoxin is 1.75 Å and that the distal cluster is the one conserved in the monocluster ferredoxins. The interacting surface is significantly bigger for hydrogenase (2284 Å) than it is for ferredoxin (1037 Å). This is directly correlated with the fact that the interacting site on hydrogenase is not only formed by the ferredoxin-like domain but about half of the protein-protein interface involves the small subunit of Fe-hydrogenase. The heme to Fe-S distance (12.3 Å) is longer in the hydrogenase complex than in the ferredoxin complex (10 Å). However, the distribution of hydrophobic and electrostatic atomic contacts are comparable in both complexes. These data demonstrate that ferredoxin is a good model for the ferredoxin-like domain of Fe-hydrogenase with respect to its properties when interacting with the cytochromec 553. The use of an isolated functional domain is certainly a good approach for obtaining structural information in high molecular weight complexes. Another significant aspect provided by the model of the cytochromec 553-hydrogenase complex is the involvement of the small subunit in the interaction site. The N- and C-terminal ends of the hydrogenase small subunit interact with the N-terminal part and the axial histidine-containing sequence (residues 12–17) of the cytochrome. This finding is strengthened by the TROSY data, where residues 14, 15, and 16 are found affected by the complex formation. From the structural model, the interacting surface of cytochromec 553 with the small subunit of hydrogenase is around 900 Å2. This is the first time that a structural role has been proposed for the small subunit of Fe-hydrogenase. The involvement of the small subunit in the recognition of the physiological partner is an additional role that adds to the well established implication of this subunit in the exportation of the enzyme to the periplasm. These data give a structural meaning to the conservation of this peptide chain during evolution. The recent structure of the Fe-hydrogenase from C. pasteurianum, a cytoplasmic enzyme (24Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Brian J.L. Seefeldt L.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shows a folding similar to that of the Desulfovibrio periplasmic enzyme (9Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian C.E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain equivalent to the small subunit of D. desulfuricansFe-hydrogenase exhibits the same unusual topology wrapped around the large subunit. Site-directed mutagenesis should easily confirm the functional implication of the small subunit in D. desulfuricans Fe-hydrogenases in the interacting site. The cytochrome c 553 interacting site on the large subunit of the hydrogenase is located near the distal cluster of the ferredoxin-like domain. The N-terminal helix of the cytochrome is in close contact to Ala-397 of Fe-hydrogenase. Asp-2, Gly-3, and Ala-4 of the cytochrome are at hydrogen-bonding distance to Ala-397 of the hydrogenase. The NH most affected in TROSY experiments is that of Cys-10, covalently bound to the cytochrome heme. In the model, Cys-10 is at a distance of about 3.8 Å from Cys-38 of the hydrogenase (Fig.5 B, part b). The same spatial arrangement of the FeS cluster, the heme and the two equivalent cysteine residues, was found in the ferredoxin-cytochrome c 553 complex (Fig. 5 B, part a). An electron transfer pathway was calculated with the Greenpath software. In the “best” pathway, the two cysteines facing each other are the site of electron transfer between the two molecules. The proposed pathway can be described as follows: the electron comes from the distal cluster and passes through the Fe–S bond of hydrogenase Cys-38, via the sigma bond of the cysteine to its carboxylic oxygen, from where it jumps to Cys-10 of the cytochrome. A further jump from the sulfur lone pair of Cys-10 to the histidine (His-14), the axial ligand of cytochromec 553 heme, completes the path. The atoms of this path are closely arranged around the straight line between the two iron atoms (distal cluster Fe2-heme Fe: 12.34 Å). The path length as calculated with Greenpath is 14 Å. Covalently bound sulfur atoms are indeed known to be involved in electron transfer of metal-organic compounds (25Bousseau M. Valade L. Legros J.P. Cassoux P. Garbauska M. Interrante L.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1908-1916Crossref Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Interestingly, close cysteine-cysteine contacts, between cysteines covalently bound to heme groups, has also been observed at the dimeric interface of the cytochromec 3 (M r 26,000) (26Czjzek M. Guerlesquin F. Bruschi M. Haser R. Structure. 1996; 4: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a closely related electron transfer pathway, including two residues coordinating the [4Fe-4S] clusters, Cys-287 of formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase and Asp-14 of ferredoxin fromPyrococcus furiosus has recently been described from the analysis of the structure of the cocrystallized complex (27Hu Y. Faham S. Roy R. Adams M.W.W. Rees D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 899-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Such an electron pathway is probably found in many electron transfer complexes. Site-directed mutagenesis would be an appropriate approach to validate the electron pathway. However, in the cytochromec 553-hydrogenase complex, substitution of one of the two cysteine residues (by Ala, Ser, or Met) is difficult to achieve without drastic modifications to the protein folding or redox properties. The substitution of hydrogenase Cys-38 by a selenocysteine would be a better approach, but the barriers of heterologous expression of the selenoprotein gene in bacteria are a limitation of this kind of substitution (28Tormay P. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 576-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interacting surface includes the environment of the axial methionine (Met-57) of the cytochrome. Residues 54, 59, and 60 were found affected in TROSY experiments. In the model, a hydrogen bond exists between Asn-59 of the cytochrome and the main chain carboxyl groups of residues Ile-36 of the large subunit of hydrogenase. This Ile residue in the ferredoxin-like domain of hydrogenase is conserved in all the ferredoxins (Ile-10). In the present model, as in the ferredoxin-cytochrome c 553 model, the main chain CO-group of this Ile residue makes a hydrogen bond with Lys-63 of the cytochrome, and the side chain of Ile-36 of hydrogenase exhibits hydrophobic van der Waals contacts with the side chain of Tyr-64 of the cytochrome. The role of these two residues in the electron transfer process in cytochrome c 553 has been previously established (12Sebban-Kreuzer C. Blanchard L. Bersch B. Blackledge M.J. Marion D. Dolla A. Guerlesquin F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23Sebban-Kreuzer C. Blackledge M. Dolla A. Marion D. Guerlesquin F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8331-8340Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The interaction of Tyr-64 of the cytochrome with the conserved Ile-36 residue of the hydrogenase assures the correct spatial arrangement by packing forces to bring the two electron transferring cysteines into the optimal position. Furthermore, Tyr-64 of the cytochrome, having a bulky aromatic side chain, probably blocks the accessibility of the prosthetic group crevice to the solvent molecules, which is certainly essential for the electron transfer reaction. By replacing residue Ile-36 by Ala in hydrogenase, both the importance of the length of the side chain for interaction with Tyr-64 of the cytochrome and the ability to block the access of the electron transfer site to the solvent would be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2083486970,"Six RNA (pRNA) molecules form a hexamer, via hand-in-hand interaction, to gear bacterial virus phi29 DNA translocation machinery. Here we report the pathway and the conditions for the hexamer formation. Stable pRNA dimers and trimers were assembled in solution, isolated from native gels, and separated by sedimentation, providing a model system for the study of RNA dimers and trimers in a protein-free environment. Cryo-atomic force microscopy revealed that monomers displayed a ✓ outline, dimers exhibited an elongated shape, and trimers formed a triangle. Dimerization of pRNA was promoted by a variety of cations including spermidine, whereas procapsid binding and DNA packaging required specific divalent cations, including Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+. Both the tandem and fused pRNA dimers with complementary loops designed to form even-numbered rings were active in DNA packaging, whereas those without complementary loops were inactive. We conclude that dimers are the building blocks of the hexamer, and the pathway of building a hexamer is: dimer → tetramer → hexamer. The Hill coefficient of 2.5 suggests that there are three binding sites with cooperative binding on the surface of the procapsid. The two interacting loops played a key role in recruiting the incoming dimer, whereas the procapsid served as the foundation for hexamer assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1999494313,"The bradykinin type 2 receptor (BK2) is a developmentally regulated G protein-coupled receptor that mediates diverse actions such as vascular reactivity, salt and water excretion, inflammatory responses, and cell growth. However, little is known regarding regulation of the BK2 gene. We report here that the rat BK2 receptor is transcriptionally regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53. The 5'-flanking region of the rat BK2 gene contains two p53-like binding sites: a sequence at -70 base pairs (P1 site) that is conserved in the murine and human BK2 genes; and a sequence at -707 (P2) that is not. The P1 and P2 motifs bind specifically to p53, as assessed by gel mobility shift assays. Transient transfection into HeLa cells of a CAT reporter construct driven by 1.2-kilobases of the BK2 gene 5'-flanking region demonstrated that the BK2 promoter is dose dependently activated by co-expression of wild-type p53. Co-expression of a dominant negative mutant p53 suppresses the activation of BK2 by wild-type p53. Promoter truncation localized the p53-responsive element to the region between -38 and -94 base pairs encompassing the p53-binding P1 sequence. Furthermore, p53-mediated activation of the BK2 promoter is augmented by the transcriptional co-activators, CBP/p300. Interestingly, removal of the P2 site by truncation or site-directed deletion amplifies p53-mediated activation of the BK2 promoter. These results demonstrate that the rat BK2 promoter is a target for p53-mediated activation and suggest a new physiological role for p53 in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2154153354,"Clinical studies have shown that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the incidence and severity of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. However, long term estrogen treatment also increases the risk of endometrial and breast cancer. The selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen and raloxifene, cause antagonistic and agonistic responses when bound to the ER. Their predominantly antagonistic actions in the mammary gland form the rationale for their therapeutic utility in estrogen-responsive breast cancer, while their agonistic estrogen-like effects in bone and the cardiovascular system make them candidates for ERT regimens. Of these two SERMs, raloxifene is preferred because it has markedly less uterine-stimulatory activity than either estrogen or tamoxifen. To identify additional SERMs, a method to classify compounds based on differential gene expression modulation was developed.

This assay panel was employed to measure the activity of 38 compounds, and the gene expression fingerprints (GEFs) obtained for each compound were used to classify all compounds into eight groups.

This effort to determine function will be facilitated by recent advances in the methodology used to simultaneously monitor the expression of hundreds to thousands of genes (1.Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2797) Google Scholar, 2.Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (7574) Google Scholar) in various phenotypic states (e.g. normal versus neoplastic, diseased, or activated cells). Such studies will lead to the discovery of specific genes that are regulated under pharmacological or pathological conditions and may suggest strategies for the development of novel therapeutics. A major advance in reducing time and expense in drug discovery would be achieved if the gene expression changes elicited by drug treatment of cultured cells could be correlated within vivo pharmacological or therapeutic activity. This is a major challenge considering the many factors that influence in vivo pharmacology (e.g. cell- and tissue-specific therapeutic and toxicologic effects as well as pharmacokinetics). To test the feasibility of using in vitro gene expression profiles to identify and characterize compounds, we chose a drug-induced biological response that is known to be dependent on gene expression modulatory events: the estrogen receptor (ER).1 Clinical studies have shown that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the incidence and severity of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women (for reviews see Refs. 3.Genazzani A.R. Gambacciani M. Maturitas. 1999; 32: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 4.Rosano G.M. Panina G. Drugs Aging. 1999; 15: 219-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, long term estrogen treatment also increases the risk of endometrial and breast cancers (5.Pritchard K.I. Recent Results Cancer Res. 1998; 152: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, our goal was to find a new method for identifying selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (6.Mitlak B.H. Cohen F.J. Drugs. 1999; 57: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that could be used to reduce the severity of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women without causing endometrial hyperplasia (and the concomitantly increased risk of uterine cancer). We sought anin vitro gene expression profile that would enable us to find compounds with selective in vivo activities. We did not require that the genes whose expression was monitored would necessarily encode proteins that are critical mediators of the desired or measuredin vivo effects of the drug. Rather, the genes only needed to serve as reporters of the drug's activity. Unlike other approaches to SERM identification that are based on trans-activation assays using mutated or chimeric ER and estrogen-responsive promoters driving reporter genes (7.McDonnell D.P. Clevenger B. Dana S. Santiso Mere D. Tzukerman M.T. Gleeson M.A. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 33: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), our studies asked whether compounds could be distinguished by their different abilities to modulate the mRNA levels of multiple endogenous genes. The anti-estrogen tamoxifen (Tam) has “estrogenic” activity in the bone and the cardiovascular system (for review see Ref. 8.Grainger D.J. Metcalfe J.C. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) even though it is an antagonist of estrogen action in the breast. More recent data has demonstrated that another anti-estrogen, raloxifene (Ral), has ER agonist effects in reducing the severity of postmenopausal osteoporosis (9.Black L.J. Sato M. Rowley E.R. Magee D.E. Bekele A. Williams D.C. Cullinan G.J. Bendele R. Kauffman R.F. Bensch W.R. Frolik C.A. Termine J.D. Bryant H.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 10.Bryant H.U. Dere W.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Ral has less pronounced stimulatory effects on the endometrium (11.Sato M. Rippy M.K. Bryant H.U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) than Tam or estrogen, thereby suggesting its potential advantage over Tam as ERT for postmenopausal women. Because they have differentin vivo effects, we expected that Tam and Ral would be distinguishable from each other and from estrogen by differences in the gene expression changes they elicit. Indeed, studies have shown that both Tam and Ral have cell- and tissue-specific effects on transcriptional activation mediated by the ER. For Tam, there is a large body of evidence supporting its estrogen agonist activity in regulating endogenous gene expression (12.Cai W. Hu L. Foulkes J.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas there is less known for Ral (13.Yang N.N. Bryant H.U. Hardikar S. Sato M. Galvin R.J. Glasebrook A.L. Termine J.D. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2075-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To be useful in distinguishing SERMs, the cells and genes monitored in response to compound treatment should enable the generation of a different “gene expression fingerprint” (GEF) for estrogen, Tam, and Ral. Ideally, the resultant GEF should also be able to predict the compound's in vivo biological effects. We describe here the development of a method to classify compounds based on differential gene expression. Thirty-eight compounds were tested and grouped into classes based on their GEF. The endometrial-stimulatory activities and anti-osteoporotic efficacies of some of the compounds were evaluated to determine the predictability of the in vitro “fingerprint” for in vivoactivity. The results demonstrate that the majority of compounds with similar GEFs also have similar in vivoactivities. The human breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA361, and ZR75–1, the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (The Wistar Institute; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HB8065), and the rat pituitary cell line GH3 were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA).

Under these conditions, the cells were partially adherent, and both adherent and nonadherent cells were maintained during the passaging of the cells. For the measurement of mRNA expression, cells were seeded (106 per 100-mm dish) in culture medium without phenol red and containing DCC-treated serum. After 3 days, the medium was changed to one containing 0.2% ethanol or the test compounds, and the cells were further incubated for 2 days before harvest. BG-1 ovarian carcinoma cells were cultured in DMEM:F12 (1:1) medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. For measurement of mRNA expression levels, cells were cultured for 24 h in phenol red-free medium containing 5% DCC-treated FBS prior to plating in the same medium at a density of 2 × 106/150-mm plate.

The ER levels in these clones are approximately 200–400 fmol/mg of protein, as measured by saturation binding analysis using radiolabeled estradiol (data not shown). Nuclear immunocytochemical staining was observed with antibodies against the ER and a 65-kDa protein band by immunoblot analyses (data not shown). The HepG2-ER cells were cultured in EMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 1 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm MEM nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 10% FBS. All cells were plated (HepG2-ER: 4 × 106/100-mm plate; Fe33: 2.5 × 105/150-mm plate) in phenol red and insulin-free media containing 5% FBS-DCC for the assays. Following an overnight cell attachment, the medium was changed to include 0.2% ethanol or the test compounds and cultured for an additional 72 h. The ER-transfected human mammary epithelial cells (B5-ER) were cultured and assayed for gene expression changes according to protocols previously described (16.Zajchowski D.A. Sager R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1613-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Compound treatment was for 72 h. 17β-Estradiol (E2), 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE), estrone, and estriol were purchased from Sigma. All other compounds were synthesized in the chemistry department at Schering AG (Berlin). Stock solutions (10 mm) of all of the chemicals were prepared in Me2SO and serially diluted in absolute ethanol. Competition experiments were performed as described (18.Fuhrmann U. Slater E.P. Fritzemeier K.H. Contraception. 1995; 51: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytosol prepared from rat uterus was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 50 nm3H-labeled estradiol either in the presence or absence of unlabeled estradiol for the standard curve, or with test compounds at appropriate concentrations. Displacement curves were established and the relative binding affinity (RBA) was determined as the percentage of estradiol binding as described (19.Korenmann S. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 36: 49-52Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At the end of the compound treatment time, cell monolayers were harvested into Ultraspec (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX) or RNeasy (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx Laboratories) and processed according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. For the Northern blots performed for evaluations of the initial gene/cell combinations, total RNA (20 μg) was analyzed using standard methods. Slot blots were employed for measuring gene expression changes in the selected GEF assay panel; total RNA prepared from duplicate cell treatments (MDA-231 ER, 10 μg; GH3, 1.0 μg; Fe33, 0.5 μg) was spotted onto a Zetaprobe-GT nylon membrane using a 48-well slot blot apparatus attached to a vacuum manifold. Hybridization of the membranes to [32P]dCTP-labeled probes was carried out as described previously (20.Liu H.L. Golder-Novoselsky E. Seto M.H. Webster L. McClary J. Zajchowski D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1733-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the specific hybridization signals was performed using a PhosphorImager (Fuji Medical Systems, Inc.). Any variation in sample loading was normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels determined following hybridization of membranes that were treated with a boiling solution of 0.1× SSC/0.5% SDS to remove the original probe. The ratio of the signal intensities in compound-treated samples relative to controls provided the value for fold change used in the assessment of the compound activity for each assay. Changes in mRNA levels greater than or equal to 1.5-fold were scored as positive (interexperimental standard deviations were typically 10–15%). The measurement of progesterone receptor (PR) in all cell lines and of pS2 in the B5-ER and MDA-ER cell lines was performed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All RNA samples were diluted to 20 ng/μl in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. RT-PCR was performed using 100 ng of total RNA. The reaction mixtures contained 5 units of rTth DNA Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer; Foster City, CA), 1× EZ buffer (Perkin-Elmer), 2.5 mm Mn(OAc)2, 300 μm dNTPs (mixture from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 10 pmol of each biotinylated primer in a final volume of 50 μl. PCR primers, synthesized by Synthetic Genetics (San Diego, CA), were PR#1 (5′-GTC AGT GGG CAG ATG CTG TAT TT) and PR2 (5′-AAC TTC AGA CAT CAT TTC TGG AAA TTC) to give a 426-base pair (bp) PCR product; PS2#1 (5′-CGT GAA AGA CAG AAT TGT GGT TT) and pS2#2 (5′-TCA GAG CAG TCA ATC TGT GTT GT) generated a 299-bp product. Amplification consisted of a 30-min RT step at 60 °C immediately followed by 33 cycles of a two-step PCR reaction (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 45 s) and a final 7-min extension at 60 °C in a Perkin-Elmer Thermocycler 9600. Following PCR, 1/20 reaction volume was analyzed using streptavidin-coated 96-well microplates (Xenoprobe, Gaithersburg, MD) and oligonucleotide probes specific for the PCR target (i.e.PR: 5′ horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The probe was coupled to either HRP or alkaline phosphatase and addition of either colorimetric (tetramethylbenzidine for HRP; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD.) or chemiluminescent (chloro-5-substituted adamantyl-1,2-dioxetane phenyl phosphate for alkaline phosphatase; Tropix, Bedford, MA) substrates permit quantitation of 300–500 initial copies of specific RNA template in a 20- to 100-ng total RNA sample. RNA samples were tested in triplicate, and the level of mRNA in each sample was extrapolated from a standard curve generated using purified mRNA transcribedin vitro. Changes in mRNA levels were scored as positive if they were greater than or equal to 3-fold. The typical coefficient of variation for the PR/BG-1 assay was 5–10%. For determination of uterine stimulatory activity, immature, 19- to 21-day-old female Wistar rats (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), weighing 45–50 g, were given daily subcutaneous injections of compounds or vehicle for 3 days. The compounds were dissolved in a vehicle consisting of 10% ethanol in arachis oil or a mixture of benzylbenzoate/castor oil (1:4). On day 4, the animals were weighed and euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. The uteri were excised and placed in neutral buffered 3.7% formaldehyde for a minimum of 24 h. The uteri were then embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-μm transverse sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the sections were evaluated for luminal epithelial cell height as described (21.Branham W.S. Sheehan D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22.Fritzemeier K.-H. Hegele-Hartung C. Oettel M. Schillinger E. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology; Estrogens and Antiestrogens. 135. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1999: 54-64Google Scholar). The difference in epithelial cell height between the estrogen (0.3 μg of E2 per animal) and vehicle-treated groups was calculated and expressed as 100%. The activity of the compound of interest as a percentage of E2 was calculated as:%x=100 [Height (test compound)−height (vehicle)]height (E2)−height (vehicle)Equation 1 The average luminal epithelial cell height in vehicle-treated rats was 21.1 ± 8.2 μm and 68.6 ± 15.4 μm in E2-treated rats. For determination of efficacy in preventing bone loss, 3-month-old female rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley/Schering AG breeding facilities) were ovariectomized under ether anesthesia and treated immediately after surgery. Compounds were applied once daily subcutaneously in benzyl benzoate/castor oil (1:4) or arachis oil/ethanol (95:5). Control groups (sham-operated and ovariectomized animals treated with vehicle) and treatment groups consisted of eight animals each. Animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after surgery. Left and right tibia were processed for bone mineral density measurements as described (23.Sato M. Bone. 1995; 17: 157S-162SCrossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Bone mineral density was measured in the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibia 5 mm distal from the joint using peripheral quantitative computed tomography. The activity of the compound of interest as a percentage of E2 was calculated according as:%x=100 [BMD (test compound)−BMD (vehicle)]BMD (E2)−BMD (vehicle)Equation 2 The average bone mineral density, BMD, of ovariectomized animals was 294.7 ± 19.9 mg of calcium/cm3 and 388.5 ± 29.3 mg of calcium/cm3for E2-treated animals. Standard deviations were less than 10% for the compound treatments. Cell lines were chosen based on prior knowledge of their responsiveness to estrogen treatment (e.g. growth stimulation/inhibition, gene expression modulation, and the presence of a receptor protein that binds estrogen specifically and with high affinity). Included were cell lines that express endogenous ER (GH3 pituitary adenoma (24.Haug E. Naess O. Gautvik K.M. Mol. Cell.

To determine which of the genes and cell lines showed measurable responses to estrogen treatment, cells were grown in estrogen-free culture medium and treated with the natural ligand, E2, or the nonmetabolizable estrogen EE for varying lengths of time from 3 to 72 h. Analysis of the levels of mRNA for the genes of interest gave an estimate of the kinetics of the response to E2 or EE treatment and an indication of the optimal conditions to measure the responsiveness of each gene. An example is shown for regulation ofCBG mRNA levels in HepG2-ER2 cells (Fig.1). Maximal stimulatory effects were observed by 48 h of treatment. Gene/cell combinations (i.e. assays) that responded to E2 or EE treatment with at least 3-fold changes in mRNA level relative to vehicle-treated controls are shown in TableI. The degree of estrogen-responsiveness in this panel ranged from 3- to 450-fold, but most of the assays showed less than a 15-fold response to estrogen treatment (for fold change plus estrogen, see Table I).Table IActivity of selected compounds in modulating gene expressionGeneCell lineFold change + estrogenE2EE2HEHTRUCenRal119ICIPatternPR(p)GH312NDaND, not determined.++++−−−−−−PR(p)MCF710++ND++−−ND−−−PR(p)B5-ER>20+++++−−−−−−PR(p)ZR75–115++++++−−−−−−PR(p)BG-125++++++−−−−−−GH(n)GH35ND++−−ND−ND−52kD(n)MCF75+ND+−−ND−ND−52kD(n)B5-ER9+++++−−−−−−IIGFBP-1(n)HepG2-ER15+++−−−−−−pS2(n)MCF710++ND++−−ND−ND−pS2(n)BG-1>20++++++−−−−−−Amphireg(n)MDA3618+++++−−ND−−−52kD(n)BG-15+++−−−−−−VEGF(p)BG-13+++−−−−−−pS2(n)ZR75–15+++−−−−−−TRHR(n)GH35ND+++++++−PR(s)GH340+++++++++++−IIpS2(p)bThe + in this assay are <50-fold.

Based on the assumption that there would be a limit to the number of distinguishable mechanisms by which a ligand-bound ER could modulate gene expression, we performed studies to determine whether a subset of these gene/cell combinations would be sufficient to differentiate known pharmacologically distinguishable compounds. We tested compounds with known ER-binding properties and activities in animal models for endometrial hyperplasia and bone protection. Two key compounds were the partial agonists, Tam (the 4-OH-tamoxifen (HT) derivative was used in the initial studies) and Ral, because they have distinctly different in vivoactivities compared with each other and with estrogen.

UV-induced apoptosis was found to be mediated via DNA damageand activation of death receptors, suggesting that nuclear and membrane effects are not mutually exclusive. To determine whether participation of nuclear and membrane components is also essential for other UV responses, we studied the induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by UV. Exposing HeLa cells to UV at 4 °C, which inhibits activation of surface receptors, almost completely prevented IL-6 release. Enhanced repair of UV-mediated DNA damage by addition of the DNA repair enzyme photolyase did not affect UV-induced IL-6 production, suggesting that in this case membrane events predominante over nuclear effects. UV-induced IL-6 release is mediated via NFκB since the NFκB inhibitor MG132 or transfection of cells with a super-repressor form of the NFκB inhibitor IκB reduced IL-6 release. Transfection with a dominant negative mutant of the signaling protein TRAF-2 reduced IL-6 release upon exposure to UV, indicating that UV-induced IL-6 release is mediated by activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1. These data demonstrate that UV can exert biological effects mainly by affecting cell surface receptors and that this is independent of its ability to induce nuclear DNA damage.

Kang S. Voorhees J.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Similar to chemical agents, UV has the ability to alter mammalian gene expression (4.Herrlich P. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 119: 187-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 5.Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Curr. Opin.

A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the mechanisms by which UV affects gene expression is crucial for understanding how UV exerts its biological effects and how it develops its pathogenic properties. In this context, one of the most frequently but also controversially discussed issues is whether the cellular UV response is initiated at the cell membrane or in the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 7.Schwarz T. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1998; 44: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholarand 8.Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 37: 1-17Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The biological effects of UV are multiple and include the release of soluble mediators, the induction of apoptosis, and alterations of surface molecule expression, just to name a few. To exert these biological effects, UV must first be absorbed by a chromophore within the cell, which then transduces energy into a biochemical signal. A number of chromophores have been identified, e.g.porphyrins, aromatic amino acids, urocanic acid, and DNA. Among these, DNA has been regarded as the most important one, since the wavelength dependences of various UV effects match that of DNA absorption (9.Petit-Frére C. Clingen P.H. Grewe M. Krutmann J. Roza L. Arlett C.F. Green M.H.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 354-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, removal of UV-induced DNA damage, e.g. by enhancing DNA repair, reduces or even inhibits some of the biological UV effects (10.Kripke M.L. Cox P.A. Alas L.G. Yarosh D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7516-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 11.Wolf P. Cox P. Yarosh D.B. Kripke M.L. J. Invest.

A. 1996; 93: 10354-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Finally, lower UV doses induce some of the biological effects at the same magnitude in DNA repair-deficient cells as in cells with normal DNA repair (14.Krutmann J. Bohnert E. Jung E.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 428-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering these observations, it is understandable that for quite a long time DNA was regarded as the only molecular target for UV, and why the dogma existed that any biological effect must be a direct consequence of DNA damage. On the other hand, a variety of groups have provided convincing evidence that UV may exert biological effects without the need of a nuclear signal. Utilizing enucleated cells, Devary et al.(15.Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) demonstrated that activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB)1 does not require a nuclear signal. This was confirmed by the observation that UV exposure of cytosolic extracts containing NFκB in its inactive form supplemented with cellular membranes causes activation of NFκB (16.Simon M.M. Aragane Y. Schwarz A. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 120: 422-427Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, growth factor receptors appear to be involved in the UV response since UV activates the epidermal growth factor receptor by directly initiating tyrosine phosphorylation (17.Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Rosette and Karin (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) reported for the first time that UV and osmotic shock, respectively, can activate cell surface receptors by inducing their oligomerization. Triggering of receptors in such a way by UV takes place without the binding of any ligand and independently of DNA damage (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 19.Sheikh M.S. Antinore M.J. Huang Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One of the most important biological effects of UV is the induction of apoptotic cell death (20.Young A.R. Photodermatology. 1987; 4: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar). Convincing data exist that nuclear events especially UV-induced DNA damage determine whether a cell undergoes apoptosis or not (21.Ziegler A. Jonason J.S. Leffel D.W. Simon J.A. Sharma A.W. Kimmelman J. Remington L. Jacks T. Brash D.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was clearly demonstrated that activation of death receptors such as CD95 (Fas/APO-1) on the cell surface by UV induces the apoptotic machinery without being connected with DNA damage (22.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Kothny G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 23.Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition, Sheikh et al. (19.Sheikh M.S. Antinore M.J. Huang Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) proposed that UV-stimulated ligand independent activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor plays a major role in mediating the apoptotic effects of UV. Considering these data, which on first glance appear conflicting, we recently tried to determine the relative contribution of nuclear and membrane effects in UV-induced apoptosis (24.Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Removal of UV-induced DNA damage by enhancing DNA repair using the repair enzyme photolyase significantly reduced the apoptosis rate in HeLa cells. On the other hand, exposure of HeLa cells to UV at 4 °C, which prevents death receptor clustering (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 22.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Kothny G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), also reduced the apoptosis rate, although to a lesser extent. It is important to mention that neither of these strategies alone was able to completely prevent UV-mediated apoptosis. However, when both strategies were combined,i.e. when cells were exposed to UV at 4 °C and DNA damage removed by photolyase, UV-induced apoptosis was completely inhibited (24.Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Hence, these data indicated that, although nuclear effects are predominant in comparison to membrane events, both are necessary to obtain the complete apoptotic response. Inspired by these observations, we were interested to determine whether the participation of both nuclear and membrane components is specific for UV-induced apoptosis or is also essential for other UV responses. Here, we studied the induction of the release of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) in HeLa cells by UV. Using this system, we demonstrate that removal of DNA damage by enhancing DNA repair does not cause reduction of IL-6 release, implying that UV-induced DNA damage is not an important intermediate in this type of UV response. On the other hand, prevention of triggering cell surface receptors by maintaining HeLa cells at 4 °C during UV exposure resulted in complete inhibition of UV-mediated IL-6 secretion. Using dominant negative mutants, we provide evidence that NFκB is involved in this signaling process and that the tumor necrosis factor type 1 receptor (TNF-R1) seems to be a major target at the cell membrane in this UV response. Together, these data indicate that UV can also exert its biological effects by exclusively acting on the cell membrane without the necessity of a nuclear signal. In addition, our findings suggest that the multiple biological effects of UV on mammalian cells do not only differ in their final outcome but are also dependent on how they are generated. The human epithelial carcinoma cell line HeLa (American Tissue Culture Collection) was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS. Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was obtained from Endogen (Woburn, CA). IL-6 release from cells was measured by subjecting supernatants (10 μl each) to an IL-6 ELISA kit (Diaclone, Besancon, France). Measurements were performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The plasmid allowing overexpression of a mutated IκB variant was kindly provided by K. Schulze-Osthoff (University of Münster, Münster, Germany) (25.Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14 (2838): 2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), the plasmid overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of TRAF-2 was kindly provided by David Goeddel (Tularik Inc., San Francisco, CA) (26.Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). UV irradiation was performed as described previously with slight modifications (24.Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells were washed with PBS and exposed to UV light through colorless medium without FCS. For UV irradiation, we used a bank of six TL12 fluorescent bulbs (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), which emit most of their energy within the UVB range (290–320 nm) with an emission peak at 313 nm. Throughout this study, a dose of 400 J/m2 was used. Control cells were subjected to the identical procedure without being exposed to UV. UV irradiation at low temperature was carried out by keeping cells at 4 °C for 10 min before UV exposure and during exposure, which lasted 40 s. Cells were kept at 4 °C for another 20 min before incubation at 37 °C for 16 or 24 h. Osmotic shock was induced by incubating cells with 1 msorbitol (Sigma, Munich) in FCS-free medium for 30 min either at 37 °C or at 4 °C (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Thereafter cells were washed with PBS, supplemented with normal RPMI medium, and incubated for 16 h or 24 h at 37 °C. Stimulation of cells with TNFα at low temperature was carried out by adding TNFα (100 ng/ml) to cells that had been kept at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were kept at 4 °C for another 20 min and then cultured at 37 °C for 16 or 24 h. Photolyase was encapsulated into liposomes (Photosomes®, AGI Dermatics, Freeport, NY) at a concentration of 1.2 mg/ml (27.Yarosh D. Klein J. Trends Photochem. Photobiol. 1994; 3: 175-181Google Scholar). Liposomes consisted of the lipids egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidyl trans-ethanolamine, oleic acid, and the membrane stabilizer cholesterol hemisuccinate. Empty liposomes were used as negative controls, referred to as liposomes. For photoreactivation, HeLa cells were irradiated as described above and either Photosomes® or liposomes (40 μl/ml each) were added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark, followed by illumination with photoreactivating light. As a light source for photoreactivating light, UVA fluorescent bulbs (TL09, Philips) filtered through a 6-mm glass plate with peak emission at 365 nm were used. Cells were exposed for 20 min, which corresponds to a photoreactivating light fluence of 12 kJ/m2. After photoreactivation, cells were supplemented with normal RPMI medium containing 10% FCS and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. 16 h after stimulation cells were detached from dishes, and apoptosis analyzed by a cell death detection ELISA (Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm of cell lysates is detected by biotinylated anti-histone- and peroxidase-coupled anti-DNA antibodies and is calculated as follows: absorbance of sample cells/absorbance of control cells. Unless otherwise stated, this factor was used as a parameter of apoptosis and is given as the mean ± S.D. of three independently performed experiments. At 4 h after stimulation, total RNA was extracted from cells according to the protocol described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (28.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with SuperScript RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amount of template needed was titrated by β-actin PCR in a 20-μl reaction utilizing the RedTaq polymerase system from Sigma and evaluated densitometrically. A hIL-6-amplimer set fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) was used as primers for IL-6 PCR. Western blot analysis was performed as recently described (29.Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mmpyrophosphate, 0.01% NaN3, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected, and the protein content measured by Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The protein samples were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antibodies directed against IκB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Equal loading was determined by reprobing membranes with an antibody directed against α-tubulin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Signals were detected with an ECL™ kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). HeLa cells (6 × 106) were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 600 μl of FCS-free RPMI medium, 2% Me2SO. Cells were electroporated with 20 μg of each plasmid DNA (pCMV-IκB-DN or pRK-F-TRAF-2-DN) according to the method described by Melkonyan et al. (30.Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transfection efficacy of cells cotransfected with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase (pcDNA6-VS-His-lacZ; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was determined 36 h later by staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μg/ml) in 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mmpotassium ferrocyanide, and 1 mm MgCl2 in PBS. Transfection efficacies ranged from 30% to 50%. Both nuclear and membrane events have been shown previously to contribute independently to UV-induced apoptosis (24.Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Since both components are essential to obtain the complete apoptotic response, inhibition of aggregation of death receptors expressed on the cell surface, such as CD95, by keeping cells at 4 °C during UV exposure only partially inhibits UV-induced apoptosis (Fig.1). Osmotic shock was recently demonstrated to induce receptor aggregation similar to UV (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to UV, osmotic shock does not induce DNA damage and can thus be used as a stimulus that acts on the cell membrane exclusively. Rosette and Karin (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) predicted that any receptor whose activation mechanism involves multimerization should be activable by UV or osmotic shock. Hence, osmotic shock should also activate the CD95 receptor and thus induce apoptosis. As predicted, exposure of HeLa cells to osmotic shock caused apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1). When HeLa cells were kept at 4 °C during osmotic shock, which prevents receptor clustering (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), apoptosis was completely inhibited. The complete prevention of apoptosis by inhibiting receptor aggregation thus confirms that osmotic shock, in contrast to UV, acts exclusively at the cell membrane when inducing apoptosis. TNFα is known to induce apoptosis via activation of the TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) (31.Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of low temperature on TNFα-induced apoptosis, HeLa cells were exposed to TNFα, maintained at 4 °C during the first 30 min of exposure, and then kept at 37 °C. 16 h later apoptosis was measured. Under these conditions, low temperature had no effect on TNFα-induced apoptosis, since the death rate was the same irrespective of whether the cells were kept at 4 °C for the first 30 min or at 37 °C throughout the entire incubation period (Fig. 1). To further determine whether the involvement of both nuclear and membrane events is unique for UV-mediated apoptosis or also relevant for other biological effects caused by UV, we studied UV-mediated release of IL-6 by HeLa cells. HeLa cells do not constitutively secrete IL-6. However, UV irradiation resulted in a significant secretion of IL-6 (Fig.2). Exposure of HeLa cells to TNFα, a well known inducer of IL-6, also caused enhanced IL-6 levels in the supernatants. Exposing HeLa cells to osmotic shock also induced IL-6 production, which may best be explained by activation of TNF-R1 (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Accordingly, osmosis-induced IL-6 release was drastically reduced, when cells were kept at 4 °C during exposure to osmotic shock (Fig. 2). Likewise, when cells were stimulated with TNFα at 4 °C for 30 min, TNFα removed after that period by medium change and cells cultured for another 24 h at 37 °C, no induction of IL-6 was observed (data not shown). In contrast, keeping TNFα-stimulated cells at 4 °C for 30 min did not have any inhibitory impact on TNFα-induced IL-6 release provided that TNFα was not washed off but left in the medium for the rest of the incubation period of 24 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2). This confirms that keeping cells at low temperature for such a limited period by itself does not cause reduced IL-6 production by inhibition of molecular processes within the cell, e.g.transcription, but just interferes with membrane receptor activation (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 22.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Kothny G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when HeLa cells were kept at 4 °C during UV exposure, UV-induced IL-6 release was strongly reduced close to base-line levels. Since inhibition of UV-induced IL-6 release was almost as pronounced as the inhibition of IL-6 release induced by osmotic shock, a purely membrane-located event, this implies that UV-induced IL-6 release appears to be primarily mediated via membrane and not nuclear events. To confirm the above presented observations, we tested the effect of accelerated removal of UV-mediated DNA damage by enhancing DNA repair on UV-mediated IL-6 release. This approach was used previously to demonstrate the importance of DNA damage in mediating UV effects (10.Kripke M.L. Cox P.A. Alas L.G. Yarosh D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7516-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 11.Wolf P. Cox P. Yarosh D.B. Kripke M.L. J. Invest.

A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To induce repair of UV-mediated DNA damage, we utilized the photoreactivating enzyme photolyase. Photolyase binds to UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in DNA and catalyzes its splitting by electron transfer from absorbing wavelengths above 320 nm (photoreactivating light) (32.Eker A.P. Kooiman P. Hessels J.K.C. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8009-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To enable uptake of the enzyme into the cells, photolyase was encapsulated into liposomes (Photosomes®) (27.Yarosh D. Klein J. Trends Photochem. Photobiol. 1994; 3: 175-181Google Scholar). HeLa cells were irradiated with 400 J/m2 UV. Immediately thereafter, Photosomes® or empty liposomes were added and cells kept in the dark for 1 h, followed by exposure to photoreactivating light. As demonstrated previously (24.Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the combination of Photosomes® and photoreactivating light significantly reduces UV-induced DNA damage in HeLa cells. However, enhancement of DNA repair by Photosomes® had no effect on UV-induced IL-6 release, implying that in this case DNA damage is not an important mediator (Fig. 3). Likewise, addition of empty liposomes did not affect UV-stimulated IL-6 secretion. As already demonstrated in Fig. 2, the most effective way to inhibit UV-induced IL-6 release was keeping cells at 4 °C during UV exposure. The combination of inhibiting aggregation of cell surface receptors by keeping cells at low temperature and enhancement of DNA repair by adding Photosomes® did not result in further inhibition of UV-mediated IL-6 release (Fig. 3), although UV-induced pyrimidine dimers were reduced by 50% to 70%, as demonstrated by Southwestern dot blot analysis using an antibody directed against pyrimidine dimers (24.Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that DNA damage might not be of importance for mediating IL-6 release following UV exposure, further suggesting that membrane events may predominate over nuclear events concerning UV-induced IL-6 release in HeLa cells. Next, we addressed whether blocking UV-mediated receptor oligomerization by keeping cells at low temperature inhibits induction of IL-6 mRNA transcription. Therefore, semiquantitative RT-PCR utilizing primers amplifying parts of the IL-6 gene was performed. HeLa cells were UV-irradiated at 37 °C or at 4 °C, as described before, or alternatively exposed to osmotic shock at either 37 °C or 4 °C. In addition, cells were stimulated with TNFα at 37 °C or 4 °C. After incubating cells at 37 °C for another 4 h, RNA was extracted and semiquantitative PCR performed on reverse transcribed templates. Inhibition of UV- or osmosis-induced receptor clustering by low temperature significantly reduced IL-6 mRNA expression (Fig.4). In contrast, TNFα induced equal levels of IL-6 transcripts, irrespective of whether cells were kept at 37 °C or 4 °C during the initial period of stimulation. These data indicate that membrane effects, most likely receptor aggregation, induced either by UV or osmotic shock cause induction of IL-6 mRNA transcription. In addition to the experiments described above, these results exclude the unlikely possibility that low temperature inhibits UV-induced IL-6 release by interfering with protein translation or secretion. TNFα stimulates HeLa cells to produce enhanced amounts of IL-6 via activation of TNF-R1. TNF-R1 belongs to the group of receptors that are only biologically active when trimerized. Since UV directly induces receptor oligomerization independently of the respective ligands (18.Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 19.Sheikh M.S. Antinore M.J. Huang Y. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), UV-induced IL-6 release may be due to direct activation of TNF-R1 by UV light. One consequence of triggering TNF-R1 is activation of the transcription factor NFκB. In addition, the IL-6 promoter contains several NFκB binding sites (34.Zhang Y. Broser M. Rom W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2225-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Hence, we postulated that, if activation of TNF-R1 is the initial signaling step in UV- or osmosis-induced IL-6 release, NFκB should be involved in the signaling cascade. Activation of NFκB is associated with degradation of the inhibitory protein IκB by the proteasome pathway. Upon a"

In its active, phosphorylated form, CheY exhibits enhanced binding to a switch component, FliM, at the flagellar motor, which induces a change from counterclockwise to clockwise flagellar rotation. When Ile95 of CheY is replaced by a valine, increased clockwise rotation correlates with enhanced binding to FliM. A possible explanation for the hyperactivity of this mutant is that residue 95 affects the conformation of nearby residues that potentially interact with FliM. In order to assess this possibility directly, the crystal structure of CheY95IV was determined. We found that CheY95IV is structurally almost indistinguishable from wild-type CheY. Several other mutants with substitutions at position 95 were characterized to establish the structural requirements for switch binding and clockwise signaling at this position and to investigate a general relationship between the two properties. The various rotational phenotypes of these mutants can be explained solely by the amount of phosphorylated CheY bound to the switch, which was inferred from the phosphorylation properties of the mutant CheY proteins and their binding affinities to FliM.

Counterclockwise (CCW)1 rotation results in a motion called smooth swimming, whereas a change to clockwise (CW) rotation leads to tumbling of the bacterial cell. Chemotaxis toward attractants or away from repellants is achieved by extending smooth runs that carry the cell in the favorable direction. This swimming behavior is controlled by the phosphorylation state of the response regulator CheY. In its active, phosphorylated form, CheY exhibits enhanced binding to a switch component, FliM, at the flagellar motor that results in CW rotation. CheY is phosphorylated by the histidine kinase CheA, whose activity depends on the signaling state of coupled transmembrane chemoreceptors, and subsequently, is dephosphorylated with the assistance of CheZ. In addition, CheY autophosphorylates using small molecule phosphodonors and spontaneously dephosphorylates by its intrinsic autophosphatase activity (for review, see Refs. 1.Eisenbach M. Mol.

CheY serves as a prototype for the investigation of response regulator function in bacterial signal transduction. Although much has been learned about its activation mechanism, the molecular basis of how the interaction of CheY with the flagellar switch results in a reversal of flagellar rotation is not yet known. A surface on CheY that interacts with FliM has been deduced from genetic and biophysical studies. Critical residues have been inferred from mutations in cheYthat suppress mutations in fliM (5.Sockett H. Yamaguchi S. Kihara M. Irikura V.M. Macnab R.M. J.

Bren A. Eisenbach M. Dahlquist F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Tyr106, located on the putative FliM binding face, plays a major role in the interaction of CheY with the flagellar switch. The side chain of Tyr106 was found in an inside conformation in the crystal structure of an activated mutant, CheY106YW, and a solvent-exposed, outside conformation in the structures of two loss-of-function mutants, CheY87TI and CheY87TI106YW (9.Ganguli S.

This apparent correlation suggested that the conformation of residue 106 may affect the signaling state of CheY. These and several other mutants with substitutions at position 106, however, displayed unaltered FliM binding and phosphorylation properties in vitro compared with wild-type CheY (11.Zhu X. Amsler C.D. Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4208-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that Tyr106participates in a signaling step subsequent to binding to the switch (10.Zhu X.-Y. Rebello J. Matsumura P.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), support the notion that the conformation of the conserved phenylalanine/tyrosine residue (corresponding to Tyr106 in CheY) is important in determining the signaling state of this class of proteins. Characterization of another hyperactive mutant, CheY95IV, suggested a role for Ile95 in switch interaction (14.Schuster M. Abouhamad W.N. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation-dependent constitutive signaling of this mutant correlated with enhanced binding to FliM in vitro, thus providing a likely explanation for its phenotype. Ile95might directly interact with the switch or alter the nearby proposed FliM binding surface. Alternatively, it might influence the side chain conformation of the adjacent residue Tyr106. To address these possibilities directly, and to explore a general relationship between switch binding and signaling, we determined the crystal structure of CheY95IV and characterized several additional CheY mutants with single site substitutions at position 95.

A. 1990; 87: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or 95IV (16.Sanna M.G. Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) also have previously been reported. In this work, versions of pRBB40 carrying the cheY alleles 95IA, 95ID, 95IK, or 95IM were constructed using dut ungmutagenesis (15.Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar); cheY allele 95IG was constructed using splicing by overlap-extension polymerase chain reaction (18.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar, 19.Horton R.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), andcheY allele 13DK106YW was constructed by recombining appropriate restriction fragments in vitro using standard techniques. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entirecheY genes of the various pRBB40 plasmids. Cells were prepared for tethering as described (14.Schuster M. Abouhamad W.N. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20.Bray D. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cells, tethered to a glass slide, were analyzed under a dark-field microscope, which was connected to a fully automated video analysis and image processing system (Hobson Tracking Systems Ltd., Sheffield, United Kingdom). The Hobson Tracker Arot software determines the rotational direction of tethered cell bodies by analyzing single video images generated at 60 Hz. The rotational direction is defined by the relative movement of the center of mass around the center of rotation, which the software assigns to each selected cell. This particular method restricted analysis to individual bacteria that were tethered at or near the poles of their cell bodies. For each strain, the behavior of a number of cells was quantified in real time for 1 min each; and the raw data from the Hobson tracker output files were converted into a bias value using a program written by Matthew Levin (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom). The rotational bias was defined to be the arithmetic mean of the fraction of time all observed cells of a particular strain spent in the CCW spinning mode. Individual cells pausing more than 5% of the total recorded time were excluded from the calculation of a final bias. E. coli wild-type and mutant CheY proteins were purified from overexpressing strains as described previously (21.Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 188-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad DC colorimetric assay. The FliM peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 16 residues of FliM (MGDSILSQAEIDALLN), purified to a minimum chromatographic homogeneity of 90%, was obtained from Macromolecular Resources (Fort Collins, CO). Fluorescence measurements of CheY phosphorylation reactions were performed as described by Silversmith et al. (22.Silversmith R.E. Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14965-14974Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Excitation and emission slit widths of the spectrofluorimeter were adjusted to accommodate the respective protein concentrations in the different assays. Time courses of approach to steady-state phosphorylation that yielded an observed rate constant (k obs) were performed at 17 °C. The reactions were carried out in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 10 mm MgCl2. For these measurements, 1.6 μm CheY (wild-type or mutant) was mixed with the phosphodonor phosphoramidate (PAM) to give a final concentration of 100 mm. PAM was synthesized as described previously (23.Sheridan R.C. McCullough J.F. Wakefield Z.T. Inorg. Synth. 1972; 13: 23-26Google Scholar). The values measured at 17 °C were converted tok obs values at 25 °C using the Arrhenius equation and assuming an activation energy fork obs of 13.9 kcal/mol (22.Silversmith R.E. Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14965-14974Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Time courses that yielded autodephosphorylation rate constants (k dephos) were measured at 25 °C, using a published pH jump assay (24.Mayover T.L. Halkides C.J. Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2259-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This assay takes advantage of the pH dependence of the CheY phosphorylation reaction when PAM serves as a phosphodonor (22.Silversmith R.E. Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14965-14974Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At sufficiently high pH, CheY phosphorylation is eliminated and the time course of approach to steady state therefore only reflects the pH-independent dephosphorylation of CheY-P. We incorporated the following modifications: A solution containing 20 μm CheY (wild-type or mutant) and 50 mm PAM in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 10 mmMgCl2 was mixed 1:1 with a concentrated high pH buffer containing 150 mm CAPS, pH 10.5. MgCl2 and PAM were omitted from this buffer to reduce precipitation problems. The kinetic results were analyzed according to a reaction scheme by Lukat et al. (25.Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Under the reaction conditions used here, CheY phosphorylation by PAM can be treated as a first order reaction with respect to the phosphodonor concentration with no indication of saturation at high substrate concentrations (24.Mayover T.L. Halkides C.J. Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2259-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26.Da Re S.S. Deville-Bonne D. Tolstykh T. Veron M. Stock J.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).k obs can therefore be expressed as follows: kobs=(kphos/KS)[PAM]+kdephosEquation 1 The quantity of (k phos/K S)[PAM] represents an effective rate constant for phosphorylation. Although the autophosphorylation rate constant k phos and the dissociation constant of the CheY-PAM enzyme-substrate complexK S are unknown, (k phos/K S)[PAM] can be measured as the difference between k obs andk dephos (Eq. 1). The ratio of (k obs − k dephos) tokdephos yields the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated CheY present in the binding reaction. It should be noted that CheY95IA exhibited a significantly lower fluorescence quench compared with wild-type CheY when equilibrium phosphorylation had been reached after addition of 100 mmPAM. This difference, however, did not reflect significant differences in the fraction of phosphorylated CheY present in the reaction, because the measured rate constants, k obs andk dephos, were almost identical to those of wild-type CheY. The discrepancy is therefore probably due to differences in the fluorescence properties of the two CheY proteins. Equilibrium titrations with CheZ were performed at 25 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 10 mmMgCl2. 5.0 μm CheY (wild-type or mutant) was phosphorylated with 100 mm PAM. After equilibrium phosphorylation had been reached, increasing amounts of CheZ were added. The progress of the dephosphorylation reactions was plotted as the relative increase in fluorescence intensity versus the total CheZ concentration. Measurement of the binding affinities between CheY mutant proteins and FliM peptide was based on a fluorimetric assay described by McEvoy et al. (8.McEvoy M.M. Bren A. Eisenbach M. Dahlquist F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 10 μm CheY (wild-type or mutant) was titrated with repetitive additions of FliM peptide in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 10 mmMgCl2 while monitoring tryptophan fluorescence. For titrations with phosphorylated CheY, 100 mm PAM was added to the sample. Buffer conditions were chosen to be identical to those in the kinetic experiments. It should be pointed out that, in contrast to the assay by McEvoy et al., Mg2+ was present in the binding reactions even in the absence of PAM. Binding constants were determined using Eadie-Hofstee analysis, assuming a single binding site on CheY for FliM peptide and considering the concentration of free ligand in the binding reaction. To estimate the fraction of free ligandversus ligand bound to CheY, the maximum fluorescence change when all of CheY is converted into complex (ΔI max), was extrapolated by fitting the titration data to a hyperbolic binding function. Interfering fluorescence from the addition of FliM peptide, probably due to residual organic solvents, became significant (maximal 10%) at high peptide concentrations and was considered in the overall calculation. The purified CheY95IV protein was concentrated to 22 mg/ml in H2O with a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon) for crystallization trials. Initially, 50 different crystallization conditions from a commercially available kit (Crystal Screen from Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) were screened using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (27.Wlodawer A. Hodgson K.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 398-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. Each droplet contained 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution. Long needles were obtained from a solution containing 0.19m ammonium sulfate, 0.10 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 25% polyethylene glycol 4000. These crystals were used to microseed a solution containing 0.17 m ammonium sulfate, 0.09 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 23% polyethylene glycol 4000, which yielded diffraction quality crystals with dimensions of 0.7 × 0.1 × 0.04 mm. Crystal seeds were obtained by 100-fold dilution of seed stock prepared with the Seed Bead kit from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA). Crystals of CheY95IV were transferred to mother liquor plus 10% glycerol and were immediately placed in a cryogenic nitrogen stream (100 K, Oxford Cryo System). Diffraction data were collected using an R-Axis IIC area detector, and they were processed using programs Denzo and Scalepack (28.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). These crystals were nearly isomorphous to the crystals of wild-type E. coli CheY (29.Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of CheY95IV was determined using the Molecular Replacement method with the wild-type E. coli CheY structure at 1.7-Å resolution (29.Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a model. Alanine was substituted for Tyr106 to avoid potential model bias. Because CheY95IV crystallized nearly isomorphously to wild-type CheY, the position and orientation of the wild-type structure was used to begin refinement of CheY95IV. Rigid body refinement in CNS (30.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) was applied to refine the position and orientation of the molecule in the asymmetric unit. The first electron density maps were generated using DM (31.Dodson E.J. Winn M. Ralph A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 277: 620-633Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Manual model building was performed with O (32.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). After refinement converged with R free= 30.5% and R work = 29.2%, water molecules were added with Arp (33.Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and were visually confirmed. Three sulfate clusters were modeled in the map and were used in the refinement. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table I. Over 95% of the residues belong to the most favored region in a Ramachandran plot (34.Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). No residues are in the generously allowed region. However, one residue (Asn62) falls into the disallowed region (φ = 68.60, ψ = −60.80) in the Ramachandran plot. The conformation of this residue is justified by the existence of a hydrogen bond between the ND2 atom of Asn62 and the OD2 atom of Asp38. Protein residues have occasionally been observed to have φ and ψ angles in this region (35.Betts L.S. Xiang S.A. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter C.W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To assess the structural requirements of residue 95 in CheY that are necessary to cause hyperactive signaling, several amino acid substitutions at position 95 were generated. The tethered cell assay was used to quantify the behavior of bacteria expressing these mutant alleles (TableII). As reported previously, thecheY95IV allele results in extreme CW behavior when expressed from a multicopy plasmid in a ΔcheYhost and maintains this phenotype when expressed from a single copy gene on the chromosome (14.Schuster M. Abouhamad W.N. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, Ile95 was replaced with alanine, which created a CheY mutant that also showed more CW behavior than wild-type. The smaller nonpolar residues valine and alanine therefore promoted enhanced CW signaling ability. In contrast, the complete lack of a side chain at position 95 (i.e. CheY95IG) did not support CW rotation. Similarly, the presence of a larger hydrophobic side chain in CheY95IM, as well as charge substitutions in CheY95ID and CheY95IK, also resulted in loss of activity. In addition, we tested the CW signaling ability of these mutants in a ΔcheA host (data not shown). All CheY mutants failed to support CW rotation, implying that phosphorylation is necessary for their activation.Table IIBehavioral characterization of CheY mutantsChe Y mutantaExpressed from ptrp cheYZ plasmid pRBB40 in ΔcheY host KO641recA.Flagellar rotational bias ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Next, a possible correlation between switch binding and signaling was explored. We selected activated mutants CheY95IA and CheY95IV, as well as one representative of the loss-of-function mutants, CheY95IM, to determine their binding affinities to a peptide of FliM in vitro. To quantify FliM binding of these CheY mutants in their phosphorylated forms, it was critical to determine the fraction of CheY phosphorylated in each binding reaction. Dissociation constants were calculated based on the fraction of free ligand (i.e. FliM peptide) present in the reaction, which was deduced by subtracting the amount of ligand bound to protein (i.e. phosphorylated- or nonphosphorylated CheY) from the total amount of ligand added. Toward this goal, the autophosphorylation and autodephosphorylation properties of each CheY mutant protein were characterized using tryptophan fluorescence (TableIII).Table IIIKinetic characterizationak obs, observed first order rate constant; k dephos, autodephosphorylation rate constant; (k obs −k dephos), effective rate constant for autophosphorylation. of mutant CheY proteinsCheY mutantk obs(17 °C)k dephos(25 °C)(k obs −k dephos) (25 °C)Ratio of (k obs−k dephos)/k dephosFraction phosphorylateds −1s −1s −1Wild-type0.2630.0530.4498.50.8995IA0.2560.0480.4419.20.9095IM0.4860.0460.882190.9595IV0.2970.0460.521110.92a k obs, observed first order rate constant; k dephos, autodephosphorylation rate constant; (k obs −k dephos), effective rate constant for autophosphorylation. Open table in a new tab The experimentally determined rate constants (k obs and k dephos) for wild-type CheY resemble those obtained by Mayover et al.(24.Mayover T.L. Halkides C.J. Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2259-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) under comparable conditions. Mutants CheY95IA and CheY95IV exhibited phosphorylation kinetics that yielded rate constants almost identical to those of wild-type CheY, leading to similar fractions of phosphorylated protein. Notably, CheY95IM displayed 2-fold enhanced autophosphorylation compared with wild-type, which, however, had little impact on the fraction of phosphorylated CheY95IM. The binding affinities of various mutant CheY proteins to FliM were probed by monitoring quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in CheY upon binding to a peptide of FliM in the presence and absence of PAM (8.McEvoy M.M. Bren A. Eisenbach M. Dahlquist F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, A and B). This peptide, containing the N-terminal 16 amino acids of FliM, has been shown to specifically bind to CheY in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (36.Bren A. Eisenbach M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2066542754,"Pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) stimulates calcium transients and catecholamine secretion in adrenal chromaffin and PC12 cells. The PACAP type 1 receptor in these cells couples to both adenylyl cyclase and phospolipase C pathways, but although phospolipase C has been implicated in the response to PACAP, the role of adenylyl cyclase is unclear. In this study, we show that PACAP38 stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in PC12 cells by activating a cation current that depends upon the dual activation of both the PLC and adenylyl cyclase signaling pathways but does not involve protein kinase C. In activating the current, PACAP38 has to overcome an inhibitory effect of Ras. Thus, in cells expressing a dominant negative form of Ras (PC12asn17-W7), PACAP38 induced larger, more rapidly activating currents. This effect of Ras could be overidden by intracellular guanosine-5′-<i>O</i>-3-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), suggesting that it was mediated by inhibition of downstream G proteins. Ras may also inhibit the current through a G protein-independent mechanism, because cAMP analogues activated the current in PC12asn17-W7 cells, provided GTPγS was present, but not in PC12 cells expressing wild type Ras. We conclude that coupling of PACAP to both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C is required to activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in PC12 cells and that tonic inhibition by Ras delays and limits the response."

Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4288-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 2The residue numbering convention follows the sequence of the avian and human cytosolic proteins. Additionally, kinetic characterization of mutants in which His264 has been replaced implicates that residue (8.Misra I. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9610-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in binding of the second substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA. The functions of other active site residues that participate directly in catalysis have not yet been firmly established. The sensitivity of HMG-CoA synthase activity to treatment with a carboxyl-directed modification reagent led to a preliminary observation (9.Chun K.Y. Miziorko H.M. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which implicated Glu95 as a residue that is important to reaction chemistry. This report documents the crucial role of Glu95 in catalysis and indicates which of the three steps in the reaction is compromised upon replacement of the Glu95 carboxyl. Finally, potential functions for Glu95 are considered, and tests aimed at discriminating between these functions are outlined. The results of implementation of these tests are interpreted and a functional assignment proposed for Glu95 in the chemistry of C–C bond formation.

Deoxyoligonucleotides were purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA). Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) plasmid kits were used to isolate plasmid DNA from bacterial cultures. Qiaex (Qiagen Inc.) reagents and protocols were used for extraction of nucleic acid fragments from agarose gels. The restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PfuDNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

[1-14C]acetyl-CoA was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA) and 3-chloro-[1-14C]propionic acid from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, or Bio-Rad. All sequences used in the lineup analysis are defined in the published data bases as HMG-CoA synthases. Only sequences encoding full-length proteins were included in the analysis. Amino acid sequences were aligned using the Pileup program in the Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Point mutations were engineered in HMG-CoA synthase encoding cDNA by using the overlap extension PCR technique (10.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Invariant glutamate 95 was replaced by an alanine. The PCR-amplified mutagenic fragment and nonmutagenic fragments from the parent expression plasmid were isolated by appropriate restriction and gel purification. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent DH5α cells. Mutagenic plasmid DNA was isolated from selected transformants and analyzed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The verified mutant clone was transformed into competent BL21(DE3) cells for subsequent expression and isolation in the same manner as for the wild type synthase. The procedure (3.Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) developed for purification of the wild type enzyme was followed for isolation of the E95A enzyme from 2-liter bacterial cultures. Protein content of the purified enzymes was estimated by the Bradford assay (11.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The purity of the enzymes was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Synthesis was performed according to Miziorko and Behnke (5.Miziorko H.M. Behnke C.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3174-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Oxalyl chloride was used to activate the 3-chloro-[1-14C]propionic acid to the acyl chloride, and this intermediate was used to thioesterify CoASH. The DEAE-cellulose-purified product was assessed for concentration and purity by UV spectra and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Due to the low catalytic activity of E95A synthase, a standard spectrophotometric assay (12.Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3108-3116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could not be employed to obtain initial velocity data. The equivalent radioisotopic assay (12.Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3108-3116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to achieve improved sensitivity. The reaction mixture included 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 100 μM EDTA, 20 μm acetoacetyl-CoA, various concentrations (200–1000 μm) of [14C]acetyl-CoA (8000–12,000 dpm/nmol), and appropriately diluted E95A enzyme. The reaction was initiated by the addition of radiolabeled acetyl-CoA to the assay mixture containing the rest of the components at 30 °C. At specified time intervals, 40-μl aliquots were removed from the incubation mixture and acidified with 6 n HCl. The mixture was heated to dryness, and acid-stable radioactivity due to [14C]HMG-CoA was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Under optimal substrate conditions, activity was proportional to protein concentration, and reaction progress was linearly dependent on incubation time. However, E95A activity was not high enough to determine K m values for the substrates. Measurement of R·CoA binding by EPR was performed using a Varian Century-Line 9-GHz spectrometer. Samples used for recording of conventional X-band EPR spectra contained a variable concentration of HMG-CoA synthase sites (10–300 μm) in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and a fixed concentration of R·CoA (25 μm). The spectra were recorded at ambient temperature with a modulation amplitude of 1 G, modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and microwave power of 5 milliwatts. Field sweep was 100 G, and the time constant was 0.5 s. R·CoA bound to HMG-CoA synthase was calculated by comparing the amplitudes of high field lines of sample spectra with the corresponding lines observed for a solution containing an equal concentration of R·CoA in a buffer. Under the instrument gain and modulation amplitude conditions used to obtain these spectra, only unbound R·CoA produces a signal. Therefore, the fraction of R·CoA free in each sample was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the spectral line measured in the protein-containing samples by the amplitude of the signal measured in the absence of protein; [R·CoA]bound = ([R·CoA]total − [R·CoA]free). A Scatchard plot, fit by linear regression, was used to determine the binding constants and binding stoichiometry of R·CoA to both wild type and E95A synthases. K d was calculated on the basis of three separate experiments. The EPR spectra of bound R·CoA were obtained at 5-G modulation amplitude and variable gain. The stoichiometry of acetyl-CoA binding was determined by a modification of the procedure of Vollmer et al. (7.Vollmer S.H. Mende-Mueller L.M. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4288-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After a 5-min incubation of the enzyme (150 μg) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 30 °C, [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (11,000 dpm/nmol) was added to bring the 100-μl reaction mixture to final concentration to 200–1000 μm. Unbound acetyl-CoA was removed using a G-50 centrifugal column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Protein in the recovered samples was estimated by the Bradford assay, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Stoichiometry of covalent acetylation was determined by a modification of the procedures of Miziorko et al. (1.Miziorko H.M. Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5768-5773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 40-μl aliquots of incubation mixture (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing saturating levels of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (8000–12,000 dpm/nmol) and 40 μg of enzyme (1 mg/ml final concentration)) were treated with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The denatured protein was transferred to a glass fiber filter. The filters were washed extensively with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 500 mmHCl and once with cold absolute ethanol. Filters were dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity of wild type and mutant synthases was measured as reported previously (1.Miziorko H.M. Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5768-5773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by monitoring enzyme-dependent depletion of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA after conversion of residual substrate to acid-stable [14C]citrate, using excess citrate synthase and oxaloacetate. Single turnover reaction was measured by combining several techniques described above. Enzyme (3 nmol) was incubated with a saturating concentration of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (500–1000 μm, 12,000 dpm/nmol). The 100-μl incubation mixture was spun through a 2-ml G-50 centrifugal column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate to remove the unbound acetyl-CoA. Approximately a 10-fold excess (over enzyme sites) of unlabeled second substrate (acetoacetyl-CoA) was added to the acetyl-enzyme intermediate recovered in the filtrate to drive the reaction to completion. Over time, 30-μl aliquots of this reaction mix were removed from the incubation mixture and acidified with 6 n HCl. The mixture was heated to dryness, and acid-stable radioactivity due to condensation product, [14C]HMG-CoA was measured by liquid scintillation counting. At each time point, additional 30-μl aliquots were treated with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The denatured protein was transferred to a glass fiber filter. The filters were washed extensively with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 500 mm HCl and once with cold absolute ethanol. Filters were dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 20-μl aliquots (20 μg of enzyme) of an incubation mixture containing (3-chloro-[1-14C]propionyl-CoA (12 nmol, 16,800 dpm/nmol) and enzyme (1.4 nmol) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 100 μm EDTA) were removed and treated with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid at specified time intervals. The denatured protein was transferred to a glass fiber filter. The filters were washed extensively with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 500 mm HCl and once with cold absolute ethanol. Filters were dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 1H, 13C (ω) half-filtered experiments were performed using a Varian Unity Plus 600 spectrometer operating at 599.885 MHz for 1H. All spectra were recorded at 21 °C and referenced to DSS (δ = 0 ppm). Residual HOD resonance was suppressed by lower-power presaturation.13C decoupling in ω2 was carried out using the GARP decoupling scheme. The spectra were obtained using a1H spectral width of 6800 Hz; 16,000 data points were collected. 13C NMR (proton-decoupled) experiments were performed using a Bruker AC-300 instrument operating at 75.469 MHz for 13C. All spectra were recorded at 21 °C and referenced to tetramethylsilane. A sweep width of 16,000 Hz was used, and 16,000 data points were collected. Signal acquisition employed a 35-degree pulse angle and a 2-s delay between transients. A typical spectrum of13C-enriched acetyl-CoA, measured in samples with a 2:1 substrate/enzyme site ratio, required 1.5–5 h of data collection (1500–5000 transients). For spectra shown in the figures, the collected data were zero-filled to 64,000 points and then processed with 5-Hz line broadening to improve signal/noise ratio.13C-enriched acetyl-CoA was lyophilized and dissolved in 100% D2O prior to running the spectra. HMG-CoA synthase samples were buffer-exchanged into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, using Centricon-25 membrane cones. After concentration to an appropriate site concentration (2.25 mm for the1H and 1 mm for the 13C experiments), the samples were lyophilized and redissolved (without significant loss of activity) in an appropriate volume of either deionized water supplemented with 20% D2O for internal lock (13C experiment) or 100% D2O (1H experiment) prior to mixing with acetyl-CoA and running the spectra. HMG-CoA synthase exhibits time- and concentration-dependent inactivation by the carboxyl-directed reagent, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Substantial protection against activity loss is observed when the experiment is performed in the presence of substrate acetoacetyl-CoA. These observations, together with the precedent for participation of carboxyl groups in mechanistically analogous C–C bond-forming reactions catalyzed by citrate synthase (13.Alter G.M. Casazza J.P. Zhi W. Nemeth P. Srere P.A. Evans C.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7557-7563Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (14.Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prompted evaluation of the functional roles of invariant acidic residues in HMG-CoA synthase. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences for HMG-CoA synthase (Fig. 1; 15 eukaryotic and two prokaryotic proteins are included) indicates that Glu95 is invariant. Replacement of this residue by alanine has been accomplished by PCR mutagenesis. Expression constructs that encode E95A synthase support production of the mutant protein in a soluble form at levels comparable with that observed for wild type enzyme. E95A synthase is isolated using the same protocol as reported for wild type enzyme (3.Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the mutant enzyme displays identical chromatographic properties and exhibits a comparable level of homogeneity (Fig. 2) and stability. Using a sensitive radioactive activity assay, it is possible to estimate that E95A is diminished in catalytic activity by 5 orders of magnitude (Table I). This low residual activity precluded measurements under suboptimal conditions. Thus, neither estimates of K m for acetyl-CoA or acetoacetyl-CoA nor pH/rate profiles can be determined. The lack of these parameters eliminates any ability of making the comparisons most commonly used in estimating whether a mutant retains some wild type enzyme traits. This dilemma underscores a basic question that must be addressed before attempting to deduce the mechanistic basis for any large decrease in catalytic efficiency upon mutation of a single amino acid. May the large effect be simply attributed to a structural alteration that characterizes the mutant protein? If no major perturbation in tertiary structure accounts for the observed decrease, then the 5-order of magnitude diminution in activity would certainly implicate Glu95 as an important participant in reaction chemistry. To address this issue, different spectroscopic tools that have been previously developed and productively employed (3.Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Vinarov D.A. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 270-271Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to evaluate the C129S mutant (which lacks the ability to form the acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate) have been utilized in characterizing the structure of E95A.Table IKinetic constants, physical parameters, and binding properties of E95A HMG-CoA synthaseParameterWild type HMG-CoA synthaseE95A HMG-CoA synthaseV max, overall reaction (units/mg)aThe rate of the overall reaction was determined by radioisotopic assay.

Additionally, binding of the probe to enzyme eliminates the signal due to free spin-label and facilitates quantitation of binding. Scatchard analysis (Fig.3) allows these data to be straightforwardly analyzed to produce binding stoichiometry andK d estimates for R·CoA. These parameters, listed in Table I, compare favorably with values previously reported for wild type enzyme. Binding stoichiometry (calculated on the basis of a 57.6-kDa subunit) indicates that E95A contains a full complement of functional acyl-CoA binding sites. K d for the spin-labeled probe is 4-fold tighter than measured for wild type enzyme, further arguing that active site structure is not seriously altered. Finally, by analysis of the spectral features of the bound spin probe, the rotational dynamics of the heterocyclic acyl group can be evaluated (16.McCalley R.C. Shimshick E.J. McConnell H.M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1972; 13: 115Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This group remains substantially immobilized when R·CoA binds to E95A. The estimate of correlation time (τc = 35 ns; Table I) is indistinguishable from the value reported for wild type enzyme (3.Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Miziorko H.M. Lane M.D. Weidman S.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that E95A synthase exhibits no significant alteration of secondary or tertiary structure that would increase local mobility within the active site, detectable as more rapid tumbling of the heterocyclic reporter group. It seems quite probable that, if the active site binding of the acyl-CoA substrate analog remains unchanged, theoverall tertiary structure is also intact. In addition to testing for the characteristic binding of an acyl-CoA, the ability of E95A to form a covalent reaction intermediate that also possesses distinctive spectroscopic traits can be evaluated. Vinarovet al. (15.Vinarov D.A. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 270-271Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have successfully employed 13C NMR spectroscopy to show that transfer of an acetyl moiety from CoA to form the acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate results in marked changes in the magnetic environment of both acetyl carbons, measured as upfield shifts of 20 and 7 ppm for C-1 (thioester carbonyl) and C-2 (methyl) carbons, respectively. C129S synthase, which has an unperturbed acyl-CoA binding site but fails to transfer the acetyl group from CoA to enzyme, will not produce the upfield shifts that characterize wild type enzyme. In contrast, when E95A is incubated with [1,2-13C]acetyl-CoA to form [1,2-13C]acetyl-S-enzyme, the sample produces a 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. 4) identical to wild type synthase. The magnitude of the upfield shifts of the 13C doublet resonances attributable to C-1 and C-2 of the covalently bound acetyl group (Table I) is comparable with that measured in wild type enzyme control experiments. These observations rigorously demonstrate that there is a very high degree of similarity between the active site environments of the acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediates formed from wild type and E95A synthases. As indicated in Scheme FS1, HMG-CoA biosynthesis is initiated by formation of a Michaelis complex and covalent acetyl-S-enzyme intermediate. Next, a C–C bond forms upon condensation with the second substrate. Finally, a hydrolytic reaction releases product. The efficiency of the initial partial reaction can be evaluated by measurement of binary acetyl-CoA*enzyme and covalent acetyl-S-enzyme species. Likewise, efficiency of the terminal product release is monitored by the measuring the rate of the analogous hydrolysis reaction, which occurs when enzyme is incubated with acetyl-CoA in the absence of second substrate. Centrifugal gel filtration (7.Vollmer S.H. Mende-Mueller L.M. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4288-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) affords an estimate of enzyme's occupancy by either acetyl-CoA*enzyme Michaelis complex or covalent acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate. When binding stoichiometries measured for wild type and E95A synthases are compared (Table II), it is clear that the enzymes are equivalent in this respect. Moreover, the component of the binding stoichiometry due to covalent reaction intermediate can be assigned on the basis of trichloroacetic acid precipitation experiments. Results of such measurements (Table II) also indicate that these enzymes are indistinguishable in efficiency of production of reaction intermediate, accounting for the ability to straightforwardly measure the13C NMR spectrum of E95A's reaction intermediate (Fig. 4). The observation of identical chemical shifts for the 13C signals attributable to the acetyl group of the wild type and E95A reaction intermediates represents a strong biophysicalargument that these species are functionally equivalent. Thechemical similarity of these species can also be evaluated. Table III shows that the radiolabeled acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate formed using wild type or E95A synthase can be trapped in comparable yield. For both species, the radiolabeled adduct can be completely labilized by incubation with neutralized hydroxylamine (100 mm) or by exposure to performic acid vapor (Table III). A negative control is afforded by formic acid vapor treatment, which will not efficiently hydrolyze thioester adducts; the radiolabeled adducts are minimally affected by exposure to formic acid using conditions sufficient for complete labilization by performic acid. These equivalent properties of wild type and E95A acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediates, as measured using both biophysical and chemical approaches, clearly indicate that the decrease in E95A's catalytic efficiency is not due to any impairment in the early phase of the reaction.Table IIPartial reactions catalyzed by E95A HMG-CoA synthaseParameterWild type HMG-CoA synthaseE95AV max, acetyl-CoA hydrolysis (units/mg)aHydrolysis activity was measured by converting residual [14C]acetyl-CoA to acid-stable [14C]citrate with excess citrate synthase and oxaloacetate.0.016 ± 0.0030.010 ± 0.001K m of acetyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA hydrolysis (μm)aHydrolysis activity was mea"
https://openalex.org/W2093050476,"Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) is an exchangeable apolipoprotein whose structure is represented as a bundle of five amphipathic α-helices. In order to study the properties of the helical domains of apolipophorin III, we designed and obtained five single-tryptophan mutants of Locusta migratoria apoLp-III. The proteins were studied by UV absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism. Fluorescence anisotropy, near-UV CD and solute fluorescence quenching studies indicate that the Trp residues in helices 1 (N-terminal) and 5 (C-terminal) have the highest conformational flexibility. These two residues also showed the highest degree of hydration. Trp residues in helices 3 and 4 display the lowest mobility, as assessed by fluorescence anisotropy and near UV CD. The Trp residue in helix 2 is protected from the solvent but shows high mobility. As inferred from the properties of the Trp residues, helices 1 and 5 appear to have the highest conformational flexibility. Helix 2 has an intermediate mobility, whereas helices 3 and 4 appear to constitute a highly ordered domain. From the configuration of the helices in the tertiary structure of the protein, we estimated the relative strength of the five interhelical interactions of apoLp-III. These interactions can be ordered according to their apparent stabilizing strengths as: helix 3-helix 4 > helix 2-helix 3 > helix 4-helix 1 ≈ helix 2-helix 5 > helix 1-helix 5. A new model for the conformational change that is expected to occur upon binding of the apolipoprotein to lipid is proposed. This model is significantly different from the currently accepted model (Breiter, D. R., Kanost, M. R., Benning, M. M., Wesemberg, G., Law, J. H., Wells, M. A., Rayment, I., and Holden, M. (1991)Biochemistry 30, 603–608). The model presented here predicts that the relaxation of the tertiary structure and the concomitant exposure of the hydrophobic core take place through the disruption of the weak interhelical contacts between helices 1 and 5. To some extent, the weakness of the helix 1-helix 5 interaction would be due to the parallel arrangement of these helices.

Several contributions to the understanding of the relationship between structure and function of exchangeable apolipoproteins have been made through the study of the insect exchangeable apolipoprotein, apolipophorin III (apoLp-III).1 Apolipophorin III is an exchangeable apolipoprotein (17 kDa) that is present as a free water-soluble protein, or bound to the lipid surface of the major insect lipoprotein, lipophorin (6.Kawooya J.K.

The structure of Locusta migratoria apoLp-III has been determined by x-ray crystallography (9.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesemberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Its structure is described as a bundle of five amphipathic α-helices, where the nonpolar faces of the helices are oriented toward the protein core. The binding of exchangeable apolipoproteins to the lipoprotein surface responds to changes in physical chemical properties of the lipoprotein lipid surface domain. The physiological role of apoLp-III is binding to a lipoprotein surface that has been destabilized by an excess of diacylglycerol (10.Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3245-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11.Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The hydrophobic moment and the distribution of charged residues on the polar face of the amphipathic α-helices of the apolipoproteins constitute a key structural element of the exchangeable apolipoproteins (1.Segrest J.P. de Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 2.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. de Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the binding process are also dependent on the structure and dynamics of the apolipoprotein molecule. Because major conformational changes are expected to occur when the soluble form of the apolipoprotein binds to a lipid surface, the conformational flexibility and the hydration of the protein in the lipid-free state appear as important properties to study. We have recently shown that the hydration and the tertiary interactions of Manduca sextaapoLp-III play a major role on the kinetics of association of this apolipoprotein with lipids (13.Soulages J.L. Bendavid O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10203-10210Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, much work remains to be done to fully understand the role of the molecular properties of the lipid-unbound form of apolipoproteins on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the lipid-binding process. In order to study the properties of the five α-helical domains of apoLp-III, we have constructed and expressed five single-Trp mutants. These mutants were studied by several spectroscopic techniques that provided information about the dynamics and hydration of the domains. The spectroscopic observations made in this study revealed that significant differences exist among the properties of the helical domains of the apoLp-III molecule. Particularly interesting are the properties of helices 1 and 5. The high mobility and hydration of the Trp residues located in these helices has prompted us to postulate a new potential mechanism for the conformational change that leads to the exposure of hydrophobic core of the apolipoprotein. Dramatic conformational changes are expected to occur when these apolipoproteins switch between the lipid-free and lipid-bound states (9.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesemberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of the crystal structure of the protein, Breiteret al. (9.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesemberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) postulated that the five-helix bundle of apoLp-III undergoes a lipid-triggered opening at putative hinges domains located between helices 2 and 3 and between helices 4 and 5. This opening would expose a large extent of the hydrophobic interior of the protein allowing the lipid-protein interaction. A similar mechanism was postulated for apoE (14.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of the experimental results obtained with five single-Trp mutants in the lipid-free state, we present an alternative mechanism to explain the required exposure of the hydrophobic core of the protein. The proposed mechanism is consistent with the properties of the helices and the inferred interhelical interactions. This mechanism would also explain why tethering of the helix bundle by means a disulfide bond between the loops connecting helices 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 did not prevent the interaction of apoLp-III with DMPC (15.Narayanaswami V. Wang J. Kay C.M. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26855-26862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the commercial kit, QuickChange, manufactured by Stratagene. A pET-32a plasmid containing the insert of the L. migratoria apoLp-III was used for mutagenesis. The polymerase chain reaction containing the plasmid and the primers was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using Pfu DNA polymerase. Competent cells, Epicurian (Stratagene), were transformed with the polymerase chain reaction. The plasmid DNA of the transformed bacteria was sequenced from the S tag and T7 terminator sites with S tag and T7 terminator primers. AD494 expression host cells were transformed with the pET-32a-apoIII plasmids containing the correct sequences. All sequencing reactions were carried out at the DNA sequencing Service of the University of Arizona. Expression of the protein was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the protein isolated from the bacteria and purified as reported previously (16.Soulages J.L. Pennington J. Bendavid O. Wells M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 272-276Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fusion protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Recombinant locust apoLp-III was cleaved from the rest of the fusion protein with enterokinase (Novagen, Madison, WI). ApoLp-III does not have any cleavage sites for enterokinase. ApoLp-III was purified from the cleavage reaction by nickel affinity chromatography. Several passages through the column were necessary to achieve a complete purification. The quality of the purified protein was checked by N-terminal sequencing and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Edman degradation analysis gave the sequence of the first six amino acids of apoLp-III (DAAGHV..), confirming the specificity of the enterokinase cleavage. CD spectra were acquired in a Jasco-715 CD instrument using a 0.1-cm path-length cell over the 180–250-nm range and a 1-cm path-length cell in the near-UV range (250–315 nm). The CD spectra were acquired at 25 °C, every 1 nm with a 2-s averaging time/point and a 1-nm band pass. Quadruplicate average spectra were corrected for the blank and smoothed. GdnHCl was used as unfolding reagent to study the conformational stability of the apoLp-III molecules. Data were fitted by nonlinear regression to Equation 1. Y=[a+b*D+(c+d*D)*e(ΔG−m*D)]/(1+e(ΔG−m*D))Equation 1 D is the denaturant concentration, and ΔG is the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant. Lifetime studies were performed using a multifrequency phase and modulation fluorometer model K-2 (ISS, Urbana, IL) using a 300-watt xenon lamp as excitation source. The light was modulated between 2 and 200 MHz by Pockells cell modulator. The excitation was set up at 295 nm and polarized at 35° by a Glan-Thompson prism polarizer. The emission was collected through a 335WG filter (Schott Inc.). A solution of p-terphenyl in absolute ethanol was used as lifetime reference (τ = 1 ns). The fluorescence intensities of the samples were matched to the intensity of the reference by changing the concentration ofp-terphenyl. Data were collected at 15 different frequencies and analyzed by nonlinear least squares using the ISS software. Different decay models were fitted assuming a multi-exponential decay law. For each lifetime model, the best-fitting parameters were obtained by minimization of the reduced χ2 value. All measurements were carried out at 26 °C, and the samples were in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8. These experiments were carried out in 0.4-cm path-length cells. Uncorrected tryptophan fluorescence spectra and integrated intensities were recorded with an ISS K2 fluorescence spectrophotometer. In all fluorescence quenching experiments, the initial absorbance of the sample was below 0.025. Aliquots of acrylamide (7 m in water) were added in microliter amounts directly to the sample. The samples were excited at 295 nm using 0.5-mm slits for the excitation and emission monochromators (8 nm bandwidth). The emission was collected between 305 and 400 nm every 1 nm. Fluorescence data were corrected for the Raman peak of the solvent. Minor corrections were also performed to account for the dilution and the inner filter effect arising from the absorption of acrylamide (ε295 = 0.23m−1 cm−1). Fluorescence anisotropy was measured with excitation and emission monochromators set up at 295 and 340 nm, respectively. Data were corrected for the instrumental G factor and a practically negligible contribution of the blank. UV absorption spectra were recorded with a HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. The concentration of apoLp-III was calculated from the absorbance of the unfolded protein at 280 nm in the presence of GdnHCl (εTrp = 5,690 cm−1m−1) (17.Elwell M.L. Schellman J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 494: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The second derivatives were calculated by the Savitzky-Golay differentiation technique using a filtering length of 9. The selective replacement of amino acid residues by tryptophan, which is an excellent and versatile probe, constitutes one of the less perturbing methods for the incorporation of spectroscopic probes in proteins. To simplify the experiments and the interpretation of the results, it is preferable to have only one Trp residue per molecule of apoLp-III. On the basis of the crystal structure of the L. migratoria protein and attempting to introduce the least number of perturbations in the protein, we designed a set of five single-Trp mutants according to the following criteria. (a) The amino acid residue replaced by Trp was hydrophobic and resided on the hydrophobic face of the α-helices; (b) the volume of the replaced residue was similar to the volume of the Trp. The order of priority was Phe > Ile > Leu. Several residues of apoLp-III met the conditions indicated above. The substitutions that were carried out are the following: Ile19 → Trp (reporter of helix 1), Phe49 → Trp (helix 2), Phe78 → Trp (helix 3), and Leu135 → Trp (helix 5). The wild type apoLp-III contains Trp113 in helix 4 and Trp128 in the loop connecting helices 4 and 5. Therefore, apoLp-III molecules containing Trp in helices 1, 2, 3, and 5 were constructed by mutating the double mutant Trp128 → Phe/Trp113 → Phe, which contains no Trp. The mutant containing a reporter Trp in helix 4, at position 113, was obtained with a single mutation (Trp128 → Phe). Fig. 1shows the location of the residues that were replaced by Trp. The proteins were expressed in very high yields and purified until any detectable contaminant was removed. The purified proteins showed a single and sharp band by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The secondary structure of the mutants was studied by circular dichroism. The far-UV CD-spectra of the five Trp mutants are shown in Fig. 2. All proteins have typical spectra of α-helical peptides with minima around 208 and 221 nm. The structural composition of the mutants as deduced from the analysis carried out with the program Selcon 3 is shown in TableI. The α-helical contents estimated from the spectra (Table I) are similar to those reported for the wild type protein, which range between 49% and 59% (16.Soulages J.L. Pennington J. Bendavid O. Wells M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 272-276Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mutants containing Trp residues in helices 1 and 5 have a lower α-helical content than the mutants with Trp residues in helices 2, 3, and 4. However, the content of unordered structure is similar for all mutants.Table ISecondary structure and stability of the single-Trp mutantsTrp-H1aTrp-H1, Trp-H2, Trp-H3, Trp-H4, and Trp-H5 refer to the mutants containing a single Trp residue in helices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.Trp-H2Trp-H3Trp-H4Trp-H5α-Helix (%)bThe secondary structure was estimated from the analysis of the CD spectra (185–260 nm) using the SELCON method (27).50.659.155.654.649.8Turns (%)18.616.913.613.921.2Unordered (%)23.322.327.324.824.7β-Structure (%) 7.5 4.9 4.9 6.0 5.7ΔG w,25 (cal/mol)cUnfolding was induced by GdnHCl and monitored by CD at 220 nm.

Open table in a new tab The stability of the proteins was determined by denaturation with GdnHCl (Table I). The unfolding parameters are similar for all mutants as well as similar to the values reported for the wild type apoLp-III (18.Weers P.M.M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Wientzek M. van der Horst D.J. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3617-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19.Weers P.M. Wang J. Van der Horst D.J. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the denaturation was monitored by fluorescence intensity, suggesting that unfolding proceeded through a two-state unfolding process (20.Soulages J.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 484-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The functionality of all mutants used in this study was tested by means of their ability to interact with DMPC, leading to the formation of discoidal lipoprotein particles. In these assays, all mutants were functional and showed highly similar kinetics of interaction with DMPC. These data will be discussed elsewhere. 2J. L. Soulages and E. L. Arrese, submitted for publication. The properties of the Trp residues located in each of the five helical domains were studied by several spectroscopic methods directed to determine the polarity of the environment of the Trp residues, their hydration, and mobility. A qualitative estimation of the polarity of the environment of the Trp residues and/or their hydration can be obtained by the comparison of the UV absorption spectra with the spectra obtained under condition of full-hydration, such as those achieved when the protein is unfolded. Because apoLp-III from L. migratoria has no Tyr residues, the spectroscopic properties of the proteins in the near-UV (250–300 nm) are dominated by the absorption and emission properties of the single Trp residue. Fig.3 A shows the UV absorption spectra of the five single-Trp mutants under native conditions. In the presence of 3 m GdnHCl, and over the range of 270–300 nm, the UV absorption spectra of the mutants were indistinguishable. Distinctive features are observed among the mutants in the region of the 1Lb band near 290 nm. The second derivative spectra were included in Fig. 3 B because they allow a better comparison of the spectral features than the zero order spectra. The position and the intensity of the trough at 290 nm are indicative of the polarity. It is clear from previous studies (21.Demchenko A.P. Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Proteins. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986Crossref Google Scholar) that an increase in the intensity of the minimum at 290 nm, or a red shift in its position, are indicative of a decreased polarity in the environment of the Trp. Compared with the fully hydrated residue, this is to the spectra of the unfolded protein, Trp78 (helix 3) displays the largest red shift of all mutants with a maximum around 292 nm, indicating a highly nonpolar environment. In this case, the intensity of the minimum in the second derivative spectra is even lower than that observed in the unfolded protein. Contrasting with the spectral features of the Trp in helix 3, the Trp residues in helices 2 and 4 show a small red shift. However, the large increase in the intensity of the second derivatives at 290 nm also indicates a nonpolar environment for the Trp in helices 2 and 4. On the other hand, the spectra of the Trp residues in helices 1 and 5 show high similarities with the spectrum of a hydrated tryptophan residue, indicating that these residues reside in a medium of relatively high polarity. The polarity of the environment of a given Trp residue in a protein can be inferred from the position of the maximum in the fluorescence emission spectrum (22.Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Because the mutants were designed by replacing residues that, according to the crystal structure, were on the nonpolar side of the amphipathic α-helices, we expected that all residues would show a significant spectral blue shift relative to the spectrum of an exposed Trp residue, which in our fluorometer has a maximum at 356 nm. Fig. 4 and Table IIshow that this is the case for all but one of the Trp mutants. The Trp located in helix 1 has a fluorescence maximum at 349 nm, indicating an environment of relatively high polarity. The Trp residues located in helices 2 and 4 show the most pronounced blue shift, whereas the Trp residues in helices 3 and 5 appear to reside in a medium of intermediate polarity. In the presence of GdnHCl, all proteins have nearly identical spectra with maxima at 356 nm (Fig. 4,inset).Table IISummary of spectroscopic properties of the single-Trp mutants of L. migratoria apoLp-III in the lipid-free stateTrp-H1aTrp-H1, Trp-H2, Trp-H3, Trp-H4, and Trp-H5 refer to the mutants containing a single Trp residue in helices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.Trp-H2Trp-H3Trp-H4Trp-H5λmax(nm)349317333311333Quantum yield ratiobThe quantum yield ratio was calculated as the ratio between the fluorescence intensity of the protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the fluorescence intensity of the unfolded protein (3 m GdnHCl).

Open table in a new tab To study the exposure of the Trp residues or its accessibility to the aqueous medium, we carried out solute fluorescence quenching studies using acrylamide. Acrylamide does not interact with proteins (23.Eftkin M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 91b: 343-349Google Scholar). Quenching studies with uncharged quenchers, such as acrylamide, avoid charge effects and have the potential advantage of partitioning into the protein core. The steady-state quenching plots were linear within the concentration range used in these studies (Fig. 5). Therefore, the data were analyzed on the basis of the simple Stern-Volmer equation. The apparent Stern-Volmer constants (K sv) for the unfolded proteins showed an average value of 13 m−1 (data not shown). The apparent K sv for the mutants are shown in TableIII. The K svvalues obtained for the Trp residues located in helices 1 and 5 indicate that these two Trp are significantly exposed. In consistency with the position of the fluorescence maximum, the Trp located in helix 4 shows the lowest apparent accessibility to the quencher. The Trp residues located in helices 2 and 3 appear to have similar and low accessibilities. These tryptophan residues are more accessible than the Trp in helix 4 and are significantly more protected than the Trp residues located in helices 1 and 5.Table IIISteady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenchingTrp-H1Trp-H2Trp-H3Trp-H4Trp-H5Apparent K sv steady state (m−1)aK sv was determined from the equation F 0/F = 1 +K sv*[acrylamide].9.01 ± 0.353.84 ± 0.254.31 ± 0.272.80 ± 0.288.68 ± 0.34K sv (m−1) lifetimesbK sv was determined from the equation τ0/τ = 1 +K sv*[acrylamide]. τ0 and τ are the mean lifetimes in the absence and in the presence of quencher, respectively.4.93 ± 0.462.76 ± 0.502.67 ± 0.211.17 ± 0.354.28 ± 0.25〈τ〉 mean lifetimecThe mean lifetime, 〈τ〉, was calculated from: 〈τ〉 = f 1τ1 +f 2τ2, where f 1 andf 2 represent the fractional contributions of the intensities.3.563.523.433.903.26k q(m−1ns−1)steady-statedThe apparent coalitional quenching constants were obtained from the K sv values and the mean lifetimes in the absence of quencher.2.531.091.260.712.66k q(m−1ns−1)lifetime dThe apparent coalitional quenching constants were obtained from the K sv values and the mean lifetimes in the absence of quencher.1.380.780.780.31.31a K sv was determined from the equation F 0/F = 1 +K sv*[acrylamide].b K sv was determined from the equation τ0/τ = 1 +K sv*[acrylamide]. τ0 and τ are the mean lifetimes in the absence and in the presence of quencher, respectively.c The mean lifetime, 〈τ〉, was calculated from: 〈τ〉 = f 1τ1 +f 2τ2, where f 1 andf 2 represent the fractional contributions of the intensities.d The apparent coalitional quenching constants were obtained from the K sv values and the mean lifetimes in"

Because transcriptional regulation of the smooth muscle α-actin gene in these cells might be mediated by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, we have examined the sensitivity of genomic DNA to chemical reagents with specificity for unpaired bases in a region of the promoter previously implicated in Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 binding in vitro (Kelm, R.

Our data reveal specific differences between purified DNA treated in vitro and nucleoprotein complexes treated in living cells. Although some differences were observed in quiescent cells, treatment with transforming growth factor β1 resulted in the development of additional sensitivity within 1 h. This enhancement was most pronounced in bases immediately upstream of an MCAT enhancer element-containing polypurine-polypyrimidine tract. A TATA-proximal element of similar base distribution showed no such hyperreactivities. These results suggest that activation of the endogenous smooth muscle α-actin gene during myofibroblast conversion is accompanied by specific structural changes in the promoter that are consistent with a decline in single-stranded DNA repressor protein binding.

Invest. 1993; 68: 696-707PubMed Google Scholar), and their persistence has been linked to stromal modifications believed to facilitate tumor cell invasion and metastasis (3.Basset P. Bellocq J.P.

Myofibroblasts, which exhibit morphological and biochemical features intermediately between fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, were originally identified in granulation tissue (5.Gabbiani G. Ryan G.B. Majne G. Experientia (Basel). 1971; 27: 549-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) where they appear transiently during wound healing and are thought to provide the contractile force necessary for wound closure (6.Gabbiani G.

Because vascular smooth muscle (VSM)1 α-actin gene expression is generally considered the hallmark of the myofibroblast phenotype (10.Sappino A.P. Schurch W. Gabbiani G. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 144-161PubMed Google Scholar), elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that control VSM α-actin gene expression during fibroblast to myofibroblast conversion will likely provide greater insight into the role of this distinctive cell type in cancer progression and wound healing. Unfortunately, convenient in vitro model systems of myofibroblast cytodifferentiation are lacking due to the manifest heterogeneity of VSM α-actin expression in many established fibroblastic cells lines (11.Desmouliere A. Rubbia-Brandt L. Abdiu A. Walz T. Macieira-Coelho A. Gabbiani G. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Some of our recent studies have focused on identifying the operativecis-acting elements and DNA-binding proteins that regulate mouse VSM α-actin promoter activation and repression in serum-stimulated AKR-2B fibroblasts (12.Foster D.N.

Early transient transfection experiments in AKR-2B cells suggested that transcriptional activation and repression of the mouse VSM α-actin promoter in myogenic and fibroblastic cell lines was mediated by promoter-proximal elements spanning the region from −224 to −150 relative to the start site of transcription (12.Foster D.N.

Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis analysis of the −191 to −150 sequence revealed a purine-rich motif spanning −181 to −176 (GGAATG) that was absolutely required for serum growth factor-dependent activation (15.Cogan J.G.

This motif forms the core of an inverted MCAT enhancer element (AGGAATG) common to a number of genes encoding muscle-specific proteins (20.Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 21.Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. J. Biol.

Not surprisingly, band shift studies conducted with fibroblast extracts revealed that a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning −191 to −162 served as a binding site for an activating protein related by molecular weight, DNA-binding specificity, and immunoreactivity to the MCAT enhancer-binding protein, transcription enhancer factor 1 (TEF-1 (15.Cogan J.G.

Inspection of sequence spanning −195 to −165 revealed that the MCAT enhancer was centered within a region of high polypurine/polypyrimidine (Pu/Py) asymmetry. Because certain Pu/Py tracts have been frequently associated with S1 nuclease-hypersensitive sites in the promoter regions of a number of different genes (23.Yagil G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 475-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), alterations in DNA secondary structure (especially structures with single-stranded regions) were postulated as a mechanism to explain differences in promoter activity observed between VSM α-promoter deletion mutants. Although this region lacks the mirror symmetry thought to be required for H-DNA, recent in vitro studies have none the less identified three single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs) that specifically interact with opposite isolated strands of the Pu/Py tract in the region −195 to −165 (14.Sun S.

Other groups have suggested the potential role for sequence-specific SSBs in transcriptional regulation (for review see Ref. 24.Rothman-Denes L.B. Dai X. Davydova E. Carter R. Kazmierczak K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 63: 63-73Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Several SSBs have been found to be sequence-specific in their DNA association and offer in vivo evidence for promoter-specific activation (25.Duncan R. Bazar L. Michelotti G. Tomonaga T. Krutzsch H.

Nakabayashi H. Esumi M. Endo H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Association of SSBs with the DNA target sequence requires the DNA to be unwound or unpaired. Although DNA is typically conceived to be a stiff, static macromolecule existingin vivo in standard B-form, strong in vitroevidence has shown that DNA is capable of assuming a variety of non-B DNA structures (24.Rothman-Denes L.B. Dai X. Davydova E. Carter R. Kazmierczak K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 63: 63-73Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31.Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Such in vitro evidence of non-B DNA structures with regions of unpairing suggests the potential for such structures in vivo. Whereas the prevailing intracellular temperature, pH, and ionic strength would seem to preclude stable DNA unpairing, there is growing evidence that a small subclass of sequence- and/or conformation-specific, single-stranded DNA-binding transcription factors may utilize such structures as recognition sites in modulating gene expression (25.Duncan R.

The present study sought to determine if in vivo DNA secondary structure alterations could be detected in the VSM α-actin promoter as a function of gene stimulation. Previous studies have indicated that AKR-2B embryonic fibroblasts are highly sensitive to the mitogenic effects of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1 (36.Shipley G.D. Tucker R.F. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4147-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). We first sought to determine whether AKR-2B fibroblasts could simulate myofibroblast cytodifferentiation in vitro. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed a cytoskeletal composition consistent with that of an in vivo myofibroblast, whereas Northern and Western blotting analyses indicated strong induction of VSM α-actin gene expression following recombinant TGF-β1 treatment of quiescent, G0-arrested cells. To ascertain whether the effect of TGF-β1 was mediated by activation of the endogenous promoter, we employed chemical probes of DNA structure and ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) to monitor differences in genomic DNA reactivity in the vicinity of a 5′ Pu/Py tract containing an essential MCAT enhancer element. Single-strand selective reagents were used because previous promoter mapping and in vitro DNA binding studies had implicated several sequence-specific SSBs in repression of MCAT enhancer activity in reporter gene constructs transfected into AKR-2B fibroblasts (14.Sun S.

Interestingly, we observed development of strand-specific hyperreactivity in bases immediately flanking the endogenous genomic Pu/Py tract. This observation suggests that DNA topology, and perhaps single-stranded DNA protein binding, is modulated in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. Collectively, these results establish the utility of AKR-2B fibroblasts as a useful cell line for the study of myofibroblast conversion in vitro and support the possible involvement of SSBs in transcriptional control of the VSM α-gene. Mouse embryo-derived AKR-2B fibroblasts were maintained and passaged as described previously (13.Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in chamber slides (LabTec) and grown to ∼75% confluence in McCoy's 5A medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Cells were rendered quiescent and then treated with 1 ng/ml (40 pm) TGF-β1 as described below for 11.5 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation with 0.3% H2O2/methanol for 10 min. After washing three times with PBS, potential nonspecific antibody-binding sites were blocked by 30 min incubation with 0.1% crystallized bovine serum albumin dissolved in PBS. The blocking solution was removed by aspiration, and the primary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) was applied for 1 h. After three PBS washes, the primary antibody was detected by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using a Vectastain ABC Elite mouse IgG kit (Vector) as directed by the manufacturer. Following color development with metal-enhanced diaminobenzidine substrate (Pierce) for 1–2 min, slides were rinsed with water, and cells were counterstained by incubation in methyl green (Vector) for 5 min at 65 °C. Slides were dehydrated and mounted with Cytoseal 60 (Stephens Scientific). The monoclonal anti-cytoskeletal antibodies used were anti-smooth muscle α-actin, clone 1A4 (Sigma) at 1:600, anti-desmin, clone DE-U-10 (Sigma) at 1:25, anti-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:400, anti-pan actin, clone C4 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:100, and anti-vimentin, clone Vim 3B4 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:5. AKR-2B fibroblasts were plated in 100-mm dishes and grown to 75% confluence as described above. Cells were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free MCDB 402 medium (JRH Biosciences) for 48 h and then fed 5 ml of fresh medium supplemented with recombinant human TGF-β1 at 1.0−10 ng/ml (40−400 pm) for 1−24 h depending upon the experiment. Other growth factors tested included human epidermal growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/ml), human platelet-derived growth factor BB homodimer (PDGF-BB, 2.5 ng/ml), human acidic fibroblast growth factor (acidic FGF, 1 ng/ml), human basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF, 1 ng/ml), and bovine insulin (500 ng/ml). All purified growth factors were obtained from Austral Biologicals except for bovine insulin, which was from Collaborative Biomedical Products. Conditions of cell harvest, which were dependent on the analytical method to be employed, are detailed below. Duplicate 100-mm dishes containing quiescent or TGF-β1/growth factor-treated cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Total cellular RNA was harvested and pooled using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as directed by the manufacturer. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis (3 μg/lane) on a 1.2% non-denaturing agarose gel. For Northern blotting, RNA (10 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde/formamide and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (NEN Life Science Products). The efficiency of RNA transfer was monitored by staining the membrane with 0.02% methylene blue in 0.3m NaOAc as described previously (37.Herrin D.L. Schmidt G.W. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 196-199PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was probed with a mouse smooth muscle α-actin 3′-untranslated region probe (obtained from D. Foster, University of Minnesota) labeled with32P by random priming and diluted in Quick Hybridization solution (Stratagene) as directed by the manufacturer. Blots were exposed to Kodak XAR film. For Western blotting, whole cell extracts of washed cells were prepared by hypotonic lysis in water. Cell lysates were supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Triton-soluble protein was denatured by the addition of reducing SDS sample preparation buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Denatured protein was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigel and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P). The blot was blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS supplemented with 1% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer was applied for 1–2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, blocked again for an additional 30 min, and then incubated with secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Cappel) for 1 h. The blot was washed six times for a total of 30 min. Immune complexes were detected by application of enhanced chemiluminescence detection solution for 1 min followed by exposure of the blot to Kodak XLS film. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 394 synthesizer. The oligonucleotides were purified on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, eluted from gel slices, and desalted by Sep-Pak C18 cartridge chromatography (Waters). Anhydrous hydrazine, dimethyl sulfate (DMS), formic acid, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and piperidine were obtained from Aldrich. Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA, 45% wt solution in H2O) was obtained from Fluka. All chemical reagents were used without further purification. The chemical reactivities of naked genomic DNA were analyzed using modifications of published procedures (38.Pestov D. Dayn A. Siyanova E. George D. Mirkin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6527-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μg of purified AKR-2B genomic DNA was dissolved in 300 μl of buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 4 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. To monitor KMnO4 reactivity, samples were treated with 5 mm (final concentration) KMnO4 for 2 min at 24 °C. KMnO4 reactions were terminated by adding 0.1 volume of sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, followed by two precipitations from ethanol. To monitor DMS reactivity, samples were treated in a solution of 0.5% aqueous DMS in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, 1 mm EDTA for 2 min at 24 °C. DMS reactions were terminated by adding 0.1 volume of sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, followed by two precipitations from ethanol. To monitor CAA reactivity, samples were treated with 2% (final concentration) CAA for 30 min at 37 °C. CAA reactions were terminated by adding 50 mm (final concentration) NaCl followed by two precipitations from ethanol. CAA-treated samples were resuspended in H2O and then incubated with either formic acid or hydrazine in high salt followed by two precipitations from ethanol to superimpose the CAA data on Maxam and Gilbert reference ladders (39.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). Dried DNA samples were then resuspended in 1 m piperidine, and base modifications were cleaved by incubation at 90 °C for 30 min. The samples were lyophilized extensively and resuspended in H2O. DNA samples were then ready for analysis by LMPCR. AKR-2B fibroblasts were subjected to the following chemical treatments after stimulation with 1.0 ng/ml (40 pm) TGF-β1 for 1, 5, and 10 h. As a control, quiescent G0-arrested cells were similarly treated following 48 h serum deprivation (time 0). For KMnO4treatment, cells were exposed to 10 mm KMnO4 in PBS for 2 min at 24 °C. For DMS treatment, cells were exposed to 0.1% DMS in PBS for 2 min at 24 °C. For CAA treatment, cells were exposed to 3% CAA in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. All reactions were terminated by washing cells twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell lysis and DNA purification were by standard protocols (40.Spiro C. McMurray C.T. Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors, a Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 27-62Google Scholar). CAA-treated DNA was then processed as described above for in vitro treated DNA to superimpose either G + A (CAA-R) or C > T (CAA-Y) chemistry. Dried genomic DNA was cleaved with piperidine and prepared for LMPCR as described for in vitro genomic samples. The genomic DNA concentration was then determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. For analysis of the VSM α-actin promoter by LMPCR, four gene-specific primer sets were designed with the assistance of Oligo 4.0 software (41.Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8543-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Primer set A was used to analyze the purine strand of the VSM α-actin MCAT enhancer element and included gene-specific primers A1 (5′-AGCAAAGACGGGCTGAAGC), A2 (5′-GCTGAAGCTGGCCGTTCACTCTAAC), and A3 (5′-ACTCTAACACAACCATATAGGGACCTCAG). Primer set B was used to analyze the pyrimidine strand of the VSM α-actin MCAT enhancer element and included gene-specific primers B1 (5′-TCCCATGACACTAGCCCAGTG), B2 (5′-CAGTGTCTGGGCATTTAAGCAGTTGTTC), and B3 (5′-GCAGTTGTTCTGAGGGCTTAGGATG). Primer set C was used to analyze the top purine strand of the TATA-proximal promoter and included gene-specific primers C1 (5′-TGGCTACATTGGATGATAAAAG), C2 (5′-TTGGATGATAAAAGAGCCTGGGAAAACTC), and C3 (5′-GAAAACTCGAAGTCATATCCCTGGG). Primer set D was used to analyze the bottom pyrimidine strand of the TATA-proximal promoter and included gene-specific primers D1 (5′-GGAATGCAGTGGAAGAGACC), D2 (5′-AGAGACCCAGCCTCTGGCCACCC), and D3 (5′- GCCACCCAGATTAGAGAGTTTTGTGC). The chemical reactivities of the genomic DNA samples were analyzed using standard LMPCR methods (42.Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 43.Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of chemically treated and purified genomic DNA samples were used at the start of LMPCR. Primer extension was performed using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the first gene-specific primer. After ligation of a blunt unidirectional linker duplex (42.Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 43.Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), PCR was performed in the presence of Taq polymerase (Fisher), the second gene-specific primer, and the unidirectional linker primer (5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTG-AATTC) for 20 cycles. The PCR products were separated on 6 or 8% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Gels were then electroblotted to nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products), prehybridized, and hybridized with a radioactive probe created by single-sided PCR using the third gene-specific primer. Sequencing markers were created by standard Maxam and Gilbert chemical modifications of genomic DNA in vitro(39.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar), together with standard LMPCR detection. Radioactive signals were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Immunocytochemical analyses were initially conducted to ascertain the cytoskeletal composition of AKR-2B fibroblasts following treatment with recombinant TGF-β1. Serum-starved quiescent cells at roughly 75% confluence were exposed to 40 pm TGF-β1 for 11.5 h. Panactin and VSM α-actin-specific antibodies (44.Skalli O. Ropraz P. Trzeciak A. Benzonana G. Gillessen D. Gabbiani G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar) displayed identical patterns of immunoreactivity (compare top right and bottom right panels). Importantly, VSM α-actin staining of cytoskeletal stress fibers was observed in all cells indicating that AKR-2B fibroblasts are homogeneous with respect to their ability to express the VSM α-actin isoform. Moreover, whereas vimentin staining was apparent in all cells (Fig.1, middle right panel), staining for desmin (middle left panel) and keratin (bottom left panel) was completely negative. Since desmin, keratin, and vimentin are cytoskeletal markers for cell types of myogenic, epithelial, and mesenchymal origin, respectively, these data indicate that AKR-2B fibroblasts exhibit a uniform pattern of cytoskeletal protein expression characteristic of myofibroblasts in vivo. This conclusion was confirmed by Western blot analyses of whole cell extracts from AKR-2B fibroblasts using the same antibodies applied in immunohistochemical detection (data not shown). To ascertain the relative effect of purified recombinant TGF-β1 on endogenous VSM α-actin gene transcription and translation in AKR-2B fibroblasts, Northern and Western blot analyses were performed following treatment of quiescent cells wi"

The role of maturation cleavage on Flock House virus was evaluated by comparing wild type (wt) and cleavage-defective mutant (D75N) Flock House virus virus-like particles. A concerted dissociation and unfolding of the mature wt particle was observed under treatment by urea, whereas the cleavage-defective mutant dissociated to folded subunits as determined by steady-state and dynamic fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The folded D75N α subunit could reassemble into capsids, whereas the yield of reassembly from unfolded cleaved wt subunits was very low. Overall, our results demonstrate that the maturation/cleavage process targets the particle for an “off pathway” disassembly, because dissociation is coupled to unfolding. The increased motions in the cleaved capsid, revealed by fluorescence and NMR, and the concerted nature of dissociation/unfolding may be crucial to make the mature particle infectious.

Flock House virus virus-like particle wild type Viruses are macromolecular assemblies designed to exert their biological role in a single sequential cycle: 1) assembly inside the cells; 2) release to the environment; 3) attachment to new host cells; 4) disassembly and delivery of genome; and 5) replication of the genome and transcription of new viral proteins. Among these five stages, disassembly of the capsid and unpacking of the nucleic acid is the least understood (1.Rossmann M.G. Johnson J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 533-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Harrison S. Wiley D.C. Skehel J.J. Fields Virology. 3 rd Ed.

The switch for this process is usually attributed to the acidic pH inside the endocytic vesicles, but in vitro many viruses are not uncoated by low pH, or the uncoating occurs slowly, not consistent with the requirement for rapid replication. A fundamental property of most animal viruses is the post-assembly maturation, which is required for infectivity. In picornaviruses (5.Hogle J.M. Chow M. Filman D.J.

Res. 1998; 50: 381-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the maturation cleavage is autocatalytic and is dependent upon appropriate particle assembly. A picornavirus capsid is initially assembled from 60 copies of the subunits VP0, VP3, and VP1 and an RNA molecule. The final processing of picornaviruses occurs after assembly in which the precursor protein VP0 is cleaved to release VP4 and VP2 (11.Rueckert R.R. Fields Virology. 3 rd Ed. Lippincot-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-645Google Scholar). The cleavage site is not accessible to the surface, and it is proposed that the packaged RNA acts as a nucleophile (12.Bavasappa R. Syed R. Flore O. Icenogle J.P. Filman D.J. Hogle J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1651-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Like the picornaviruses, the nodaviruses are initially constructed as provirions, which mature to an infectious virion by post-assembly cleavage of α protein into β (43 kDa) and γ (4 kDa) subunits.Flock House virus (FHV)1 is a nonenveloped T = 3 icosahedral insect virus of the family Nodaviridae (Fig. 1). The virus particle consists of 180 copies of the coat protein, which encapsidates the bipartite RNA genome (9.Gallagher T.M. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Rueckert R.R. Fields Virology. 3 rd Ed. Lippincot-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-645Google Scholar, 13.Cheng R.H. Reddy V.S.

Biol. 1994; 235: 565-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The FHV coat protein expressed in a baculovirus system spontaneously assembles into a virus-like particle (VLP) containing cellular RNA, and the α capsid protein undergoes cleavage into β and γ subunits as in the native virus (10.Schneemann A. Reddy V. Johnson J.E. Adv. Virus. Res. 1998; 50: 381-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Schneemann A. Dasgupta R. Johnson J.E. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein capsids in VLPs and authentic particles are indistinguishable by crystallography, although the VLPs are more susceptible to proteolysis than the authentic particles (16.Bothner B. Schneemann A. Marshall D. Reddy V. Johnson J.E. Siuzdak G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In this study, we attempt to understand the changes in stability and dynamics caused by the cleavage. With this purpose, we have utilized two baculo expressed VLPs, a wild type sequence (SFHVwt) and a mutant virus (D75N) (15.Schneemann A. Dasgupta R. Johnson J.E. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of Asp75, which is at the cleavage site; replacement of the aspartic acid residue with asparagine results in the production of noninfectious particles that do not undergo cleavage (17.Zlotnick A. Reddy V.S. Dasgupta R. Schneemann A. Ray Jr., W.J. Rueckert R.R. Johnson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13680-13684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the capsid of the cleavage-defective mutant is composed of 180 copies of the intact 47-kDa precursor α protein. We find that the uncleaved capsid protein can undergo dissociation not concerted with unfolding, whereas in wt VLPs, maturation cleavage favors a metastable state in which dissociation of the coat protein is coupled to unfolding. A partially folded state of the uncleaved capsid protein is characterized by fluorescence, circular dichroism, and NMR methods. In addition, cleavage may serve as part of the switch for dissociation, and the resulting “off pathway” disassembly may be important during the viral infection cycle.DISCUSSIONThe structure of several icosahedral viruses has been determined with a remarkable level of precision (1.Rossmann M.G.

The atomic structure of viruses have revolutionized the field of virology by providing insights about the interactions of viruses with cells, drugs, and the immune system (8.Smith T.J Baker T. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 1-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the structures of viruses provide only frozen pictures of a final product of an assembly line. To dissect the steps of this assembly line, it is necessary to add dynamic studies to the structural information. To disassemble a virus is like dismantling the pieces of an intricate puzzle, in which the parts contain an elaborate code for self-assembly. We described here that by combining previous structural information of wild type and mutant virus-like particles of FHV with spectroscopic and hydrodynamic methods in a thermodynamic approach, it is possible to identify one of the important rules of this code. An amino acid substitution (D75N) prevents maturation cleavage of the α coat protein locking the capsid as a provirion. The D75N provirion dissociates to folded coat proteins, and unfolding is not coupled to the dissociation process. On the other hand, mature wild type particles dissociate and unfold in a concerted fashion.Nodavirus processing generates an infectious particle by cleaving the full-length α subunit at residue 363 to generate β and γ subunits. The x-ray structure reveals that the first 22 residues of FHV γ chains are amphipathic helices that interact with RNA about the icosahedral 3-fold axes and form a helical bundle at the fivefold axes (13.Cheng R.H. Reddy V.S. Olson N.H. Fisher A.J. Baker T.S. Johnson J.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Our rotation and NMR data show that it is very likely that the cleavage results in the γ chains gaining significant high mobility. This mobility is probably important for virus-cellular membrane interactions, perhaps in a way similar to the mechanism of fusion suggested for several enveloped viruses (35.Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 36.Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

Cell. 1999; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Whether the γ chain can act as a conduit for RNA translocation is still to be proved; however, recent studies have demonstrated dramatic membrane activity of residues 1–22 of γ chain (40.Bong D.T. Steinem C. Janshoff A. Johnson J.E. Ghadiri M.R. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41.Janshoff A. Bong D.T. Steinem C. Johnson J.E. Ghadiri M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5328-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the cleavage of α subunit was proposed based on site-directed mutation studies (17.Zlotnick A.

Assembly places Asp75 in a buried, hydrophobic environment resulting in an abnormally high pK a of 6.8. Under physiological conditions, Asp75 is protonated and serves as a proton donor for a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Asn363. Assembly locally destabilizes the scissile bond between residues 363 and 364, making it susceptible to attack by a water molecule, which is probably activated by the anionic environment of the directly adjacent bulk RNA. The replacement of Asp75 with Asn prevents the peptide cleavage.Although there was no apparent difference between wild type and cleavage-defective VLPs with regard to dissociation by urea, the concerted dissociation and unfolding of the wild type particle may render it less stable (or metastable). During infection, a trigger must exist to provoke dissociation, which would be facilitated by maturation turning the particle metastable. A coupling of unfolding to dissociation may be crucial to tunnel the activation energy and speed up the reaction.For a given urea concentration that resulted in dissociation of wt and mutant VLPs, the yield of reassembly was much higher for the cleavage-defective particle (D75N) as measured by gel filtration chromatography. Circular dichroism confirmed the existence of a folded, dissociated D75N coat protein, whereas the CD of urea-dissociated wild type coat protein did not show any significant secondary structure. The NMR of the dissociated D75N coat protein also suggests a high molecular mass subunit, with low mobility, characteristic of a folded structure. The wt particles were less stable to pressure than the D75N mutants. The higher flexibility resulting from the cleavage of α into β + γ subunits increases the compressibility and makes the particle more sensitive to pressure. Several single-chain proteins are generally less flexible and more stable than their dimeric counterparts (42.Liang H. Sandberg W.S. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7010-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43.Predki P.F. Regan L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9834-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44.Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T.

For the cleaved, mature particle, the difference in chemical potential between folded and unfolded subunits (β + γ) is either nonexistent or very small. This explains the low yield of reassembly from the dissociated, cleaved proteins when urea is diluted. Overall, our results demonstrate that the maturation/cleavage process targets the particle for an off pathway disassembly, because dissociation is coupled to unfolding. Because D75N is a paradigm for a short-lived α subunit, the different properties should be crucial for the viral infection cycle. On one hand, a metastable state of the cleaved coat protein would contribute to the rapid dissociation concerted to unfolding when a specific cellular switch is turned on at the early stages of viral infection. On the other hand, after RNA replication and protein synthesis, the folded noncleaved coat protein would readily assemble into a ribonucleoprotein complex. Kinetic studies should provide additional insights about the role of metastable states in virus infectivity.Figure 7Gibbs free energy diagram for the dissociation and unfolding of noncleaved (D75N mutant) and cleaved (wild type) Flock House virus.

The higher flexibility resulting from the cleavage of α into β + γ subunits increases the compressibility and makes the particle more sensitive to pressure. Several single-chain proteins are generally less flexible and more stable than their dimeric counterparts (42.Liang H. Sandberg W.S. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7010-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43.Predki P.F. Regan L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9834-9839Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44.Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T.

For the cleaved, mature particle, the difference in chemical potential between folded and unfolded subunits (β + γ) is either nonexistent or very small. This explains the low yield of reassembly from the dissociated, cleaved proteins when urea is diluted. Overall, our results demonstrate that the maturation/cleavage process targets the particle for an off pathway disassembly, because dissociation is coupled to unfolding. Because D75N is a paradigm for a short-lived α subunit, the different properties should be crucial for the viral infection cycle. On one hand, a metastable state of the cleaved coat protein would contribute to the rapid dissociation concerted to unfolding when a specific cellular switch is turned on at the early stages of viral infection. On the other hand, after RNA replication and protein synthesis, the folded noncleaved coat protein would readily assemble into a ribonucleoprotein complex. Kinetic studies should provide additional insights about the role of metastable states in virus infectivity. The structure of several icosahedral viruses has been determined with a remarkable level of precision (1.Rossmann M.G. Johnson J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 533-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Harrison S. Wiley D.C. Skehel J.J. Fields Virology. 3 rd Ed.

The atomic structure of viruses have revolutionized the field of virology by providing insights about the interactions of viruses with cells, drugs, and the immune system (8.Smith T.J Baker T. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 1-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the structures of viruses provide only frozen pictures of a final product of an assembly line. To dissect the steps of this assembly line, it is necessary to add dynamic studies to the structural information. To disassemble a virus is like dismantling the pieces of an intricate puzzle, in which the parts contain an elaborate code for self-assembly. We described here that by combining previous structural information of wild type and mutant virus-like particles of FHV with spectroscopic and hydrodynamic methods in a thermodynamic approach, it is possible to identify one of the important rules of this code. An amino acid substitution (D75N) prevents maturation cleavage of the α coat protein locking the capsid as a provirion. The D75N provirion dissociates to folded coat proteins, and unfolding is not coupled to the dissociation process. On the other hand, mature wild type particles dissociate and unfold in a concerted fashion. Nodavirus processing generates an infectious particle by cleaving the full-length α subunit at residue 363 to generate β and γ subunits. The x-ray structure reveals that the first 22 residues of FHV γ chains are amphipathic helices that interact with RNA about the icosahedral 3-fold axes and form a helical bundle at the fivefold axes (13.Cheng R.H. Reddy V.S. Olson N.H. Fisher A.J. Baker T.S. Johnson J.E. Structure. 1994; 2: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Our rotation and NMR data show that it is very likely that the cleavage results in the γ chains gaining significant high mobility. This mobility is probably important for virus-cellular membrane interactions, perhaps in a way similar to the mechanism of fusion suggested for several enveloped viruses (35.Carr C.M. Kim P.S.

Whether the γ chain can act as a conduit for RNA translocation is still to be proved; however, recent studies have demonstrated dramatic membrane activity of residues 1–22 of γ chain (40.Bong D.T. Steinem C. Janshoff A. Johnson J.E. Ghadiri M.R. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41.Janshoff A. Bong D.T. Steinem C. Johnson J.E. Ghadiri M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5328-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the cleavage of α subunit was proposed based on site-directed mutation studies (17.Zlotnick A. Reddy V.S. Dasgupta R. Schneemann A. Ray Jr., W.J. Rueckert R.R. Johnson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13680-13684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly places Asp75 in a buried, hydrophobic environment resulting in an abnormally high pK a of 6.8. Under physiological conditions, Asp75 is protonated and serves as a proton donor for a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Asn363. Assembly locally destabilizes the scissile bond between residues 363 and 364, making it susceptible to attack by a water molecule, which is probably activated by the anionic environment of the directly adjacent bulk RNA. The replacement of Asp75 with Asn prevents the peptide cleavage. Although there was no apparent difference between wild type and cleavage-defective VLPs with regard to dissociation by urea, the concerted dissociation and unfolding of the wild type particle may render it less stable (or metastable). During infection, a trigger must exist to provoke dissociation, which would be facilitated by maturation turning the particle metastable. A coupling of unfolding to dissociation may be crucial to tunnel the activation energy and speed up the reaction. For a given urea concentration that resulted in dissociation of wt and mutant VLPs, the yield of reassembly was much higher for the cleavage-defective particle (D75N) as measured by gel filtration chromatography. Circular dichroism confirmed the existence of a folded, dissociated D75N coat protein, whereas the CD of urea-dissociated wild type coat protein did not show any significant secondary structure. The NMR of the dissociated D75N coat protein also suggests a high molecular mass subunit, with low mobility, characteristic of a folded structure. The wt particles were less stable to pressure than the D75N mutants. The higher flexibility resulting from the cleavage of α into β + γ subunits increases the compressibility and makes the particle more sensitive to pressure.

We show here that a low concentration of a novel iron chelator, desferri-exochelin 772SM, reversibly arrests the growth of human VSMCin vitro, specifically in G0/G1 and S phases. The lipophilic desferri-exochelin is effective more rapidly and at a 10-fold lower concentration than the nonlipophilic iron chelator deferoxamine. Treatment of growth-synchronized VSMC with the desferri-exochelin results in down-regulation of cyclin E/ Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdk2 activity but does not affect the cyclin D/Cdk4/retinoblastoma phosphorylation pathway. Both DNA replication and RNA transcription are inhibited in exochelin-treated cells, but protein synthesis is not. The ability of desferri-exochelin 772SM to reversibly block the growth of VSMC in vitro with no apparent cytotoxicity suggests that the exochelin may be useful as a therapeutic agent to limit restenosis in injured vessels.

In animal models, proliferation and migration of VSMC begin soon after vascular injury occurs and culminate in formation of a neointima that encroaches on the interior space of the vessel (1.Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 208-215PubMed Google Scholar). Such neointima formation is seen in a substantial number of patients following balloon angioplasty and may result in a narrowing or blockage (restenosis) of the vessel that requires further intervention (2.Wurdeman R.L. Hilleman D.E. Mooss A.N. Pharmacotherapy. 1998; 18: 1024-1040PubMed Google Scholar). By preventing the immediate proliferation of VSMC following vascular injury, it may be possible to avert neointima formation and restenosis. In this report, we describe the cell cycle-specific growth inhibitory effects of a novel iron chelator, desferri-exochelin 772SM, on serum- and growth factor-stimulated human VSMC in vitro. Iron is required for a variety of cellular functions, including respiration, energy metabolism, and DNA synthesis. In addition, iron participates in redox reactions that generate free radicals, which may activate signaling pathways for cell proliferation. Treatment with iron chelators has previously been shown to cause growth arrest in several types of cells (3.Kulp K.S. Green S.L. Vulliet P.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4.Lucas J.J. Szepesi A. Domenico J. Takase K. Tordai A. Terada N. Gelfand E.W.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3968-3975PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of chelation varied depending upon both the cell type and the chelator used (5.Brodie C. Siriwardana G. Lucas J. Schleicher R. Terada N. Szepesi A. Gelfand E. Seligman P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3968-3975PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Van Reyk D.M. Sarel S. Hunt N.H. Int. J.

The iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) inhibited DNA synthesis in cultured rat VSMC (8.Porreca E. Ucchino S. Di Febbo C. Di Bartolomeo N. Angelucci D. Napolitano A.M. Mezzetti A. Cuccurullo F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and blocked neointimal growth in a rat model of vascular injury (8.Porreca E. Ucchino S. Di Febbo C. Di Bartolomeo N. Angelucci D. Napolitano A.M. Mezzetti A. Cuccurullo F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, DFO enters cells only very slowly by pinocytosis (9.Lloyd J.B. Cable H. Rice-Evans C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1361-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and causes hypotension when given in large dosesin vivo (10.Howland M.A. Clin. Toxicol. 1996; 34: 491-497Google Scholar). Therefore, DFO is of limited usefulness for determining mechanisms by which iron deprivation prevents cell cycle progression or for the clinical treatment of restenosis. Exochelins, the secreted siderophores of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are a family of high affinity iron chelators that are both water- and lipid-soluble, a property that allows them to enter cells rapidly and chelate specific intracellular iron pools (11.Gobin J.

No cytotoxicity was seen after 72 h of exposure to the desferri-exochelin, and the cell cycle arrest was fully reversible. On the basis of these results, exochelins may prove useful experimentally for elucidating the role of iron in cell growth and clinically as drugs capable of inhibiting the formation of restenotic lesions following vascular injury. Synthetic desferri-exochelin 772SM (11.Gobin J. Moore C.H. Reeve Jr., J.R. Wong D.K. Gibson B.W. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5189-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was provided by Keystone Biomedical, Inc. The exochelin was >98% pure and <2% iron-saturated, and it was chemically and functionally indistinguishable from native desferri-exochelin 772SM isolated from the culture filtrate of M. tuberculosis. 2M. A. Horwitz, unpublished data. Desferri-exochelin 772SM has a molecular weight of 719, and was prepared as a 1.159 mm stock solution in 0.09% NaCl. Iron-loaded exochelin (ferri-exochelin) was prepared by solubilizing desferri-exochelin 772SM in 20% ethanol at 37 °C, diluting it in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and saturating it with iron by the addition of a 10-fold excess of iron as ferric ammonium citrate. Ferri-exochelin 772SM was purified by using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and eluting with a 0–50% acetonitrile gradient. Human VSMC were isolated from saphenous veins discarded from surgical procedures or from aorta or iliac artery from unused transplant donor tissue (14.Hodges-Garcia Y. Horwitz L.D. Madigan N. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 34: 364-366Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Primary VSMC cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2.5% heat-inactivated human cord serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) under 5% CO2 in air. All experiments were performed with second or third passage cells. The cells were quiesced by changing the medium to 0.05% human cord serum, 0.05% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 for 24 h, washing with PBS, and then changing to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium for 48 h. Cells were released from quiescence by stimulation with 20 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Research and Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and medium with 5% serum (2.5% fetal bovine serum, 2.5% human cord serum). The VSMC were harvested in 1 mmEDTA in PBS and then centrifuged at 200 × g at 25 °C for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS, and a sample was removed and stained with propidium iodide using the method of Krishan (15.Krishan A. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Data were collected for 10,000 events for each sample. The Modfit LT program (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) was used for cell cycle modeling. The VSMC were harvested as above, pelleted, resuspended in lysate buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmNa3PO4, and 1% protease inhibitor (Sigma)) and stored at −80 °C. The cell suspensions were thawed on ice, and the cells were lysed by sonication. The sonicate was centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were determined for each lysate using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Total protein samples (30 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a Mini Trans-Blot system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was stained with Ponceau Red to confirm equal loading and then blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The appropriate primary antibody was added, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and then the secondary antibody was added for an additional 1-h incubation. The protein bands were detected by ECL+ Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure of Hyper Film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies that were used include 14591A (anti-cyclin E) and 14001A (anti-Rb) from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and sc-753 (anti-cyclin D), sc-751 (anti-cyclin A), and sc-528 (anti-p27) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2030) and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (sc-2031) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as secondary antibodies. VSMC were grown in six-well plates with 2 ml of medium/well. Tritiated thymidine ([methyl-3H]thymidine), uridine ([5,6-3H]uridine) and leucine (l-[4,5-3H]leucine) (all from NEN Life Science Products) were each diluted in sterile PBS to a working concentration of 25 μCi/ml. Eighty μl of the appropriate tritiated solution were added per well. After a 4-h incubation under standard cell culture conditions, the medium was aspirated, and the wells were washed twice with PBS. Each well was treated with 0.2 mperchloric acid for 2–3 min and then washed again with PBS. One ml of 1% SDS, 0.1 n NaOH was added to each well, and the contents of each well were transferred to a large scintillation vial with 16 ml of Ecoscint H scintillation solution. The radioactivity in each sample was determined in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Kinase assays were based on the methods of Matsushime et al. (16.Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by scraping into immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 units/ml aprotinin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Extra lysates were stored at −80 °C. Lysates were thawed on ice for 1 h with occasional vortexing and then clarified by centrifuging at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentrations in the clarified supernatants were quantified using the Bio-Rad DCprotein assay system. Protein G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were precoated with saturating amounts of goat polyclonal antibodies to human Cdk4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-260-G) or Cdk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-163-G). 250 μg of supernatant protein were immunoprecipitated for 2–6 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of precoated beads. The immunoprecipitated proteins on beads were washed four times with 1 ml of cold immunoprecipitation buffer and then twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The beads were suspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mmEGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm ATP) with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products; 6000 Ci/mmol) and 1 μg of substrate, either histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for Cdk2 assays or a glutathioneS-transferase-Rb fusion protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for Cdk4 assays. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with occasional mixing and then boiled in polyacrylamide gel sample buffer containing SDS. Samples were separated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. VSMC grown in six-well plates were washed with prewarmed labeling medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, no phosphate; Life Technologies, Inc.), the medium was removed, and then 0.5 ml of medium was added per well. H332PO4 in HCl (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was added to a final concentration of 2 mCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for 2 h under standard cell culture conditions. The cells were washed with PBS, and 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin) was added to each well. The cells were dislodged by scraping, incubated in the wells for 20 min at 4 °C, and then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The lysate was clarified by centrifuging for 30 min at 26,000 × g at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, protein A PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were preabsorbed with saturating amounts of rabbit polyclonal B-myb antibody (Santa Cruz sc-724). Fifty μl of precoated beads were added to each sample and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with mixing. The immunoprecipitated proteins on beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in protein sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, the beads were spun out, and the supernatants were electrophoresed through a 10% polyacrylamide gel. After drying down the gel, phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Experiments were performed with a lipophilic exochelin, desferri-exochelin 772SM (13.Horwitz L.D. Sherman N.A. Kong Y. Pike A.W. Gobin J. Fennessey P.V. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5263-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the exochelin on growth of VSMC, we treated actively growing cells with various concentrations of desferri-exochelin 772SM for 6 or 24 h. [methyl-3H]Thymidine was added 4 h before the end of the incubation period. Incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into DNA during S phase provides an indirect measure of cell growth and replication. In VSMC treated with desferri-exochelin 772SM for 6 or 24 h, [methyl-3H]thymidine uptake was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1). In contrast, cell growth was not attenuated in VSMC treated with iron-loaded exochelin 772SM (Fig.1 a). Therefore, inhibition of VSMC growth by the desferri-exochelin is probably due entirely to its iron chelating capacity. VSMC treated with the nonlipophilic iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) for 6 h exhibited little inhibition of [methyl-3H]thymidine uptake (Fig.1 a). Although treatment for 24 h with DFO caused a dose-dependent inhibition of [methyl-3H]thymidine uptake in the VSMC, a 10-fold higher concentration of DFO was needed to achieve a level of inhibition comparable with that of the desferri-exochelin (Fig.1 b). Since cells exposed to desferri-exochelin 772SM for 72 h retained the ability to exclude trypan blue (not shown), the exochelin was not cytotoxic. To obtain a profile of the normal progression of VSMC through the cell cycle, we synchronized VSMC by quiescing them for 3 days, resulting in 80–95% of the cells accumulating in G0/G1 as determined by flow cytometry (FACS). The quiesced cells were stimulated with medium containing 5% serum and 20 ng/ml EGF, and samples were taken every 2 h. By FACS analysis, the VSMC entered S phase 16–18 h after stimulation and entered G2/M 22–24 h after stimulation (not shown). To determine whether desferri-exochelin 772SM arrests cell growth at a particular point in the cell cycle, we added 50 μmdesferri-exochelin to cultures of VSMC at specific time points during or after release from quiescence and analyzed samples by FACS. When the desferri-exochelin was added to quiesced VSMC simultaneously with EGF and serum, the cells remained arrested in G0/G1, while the control cells traversed the cell cycle (Fig. 2 a). Similarly, when desferri-exochelin was added to cells that were mostly in S phase (18 h), the cells were arrested in S phase, while the control cells progressed to G2/M (Fig. 2 b). However, when desferri-exochelin was added to cells that were mostly in G2/M (27 h), the cells progressed through G2/M and into G1 in the same manner as the control cells (Fig. 2 c). Therefore, desferri-exochelin 772SM specifically blocks VSMC progression through the G0/G1 and S phases but not through G2/M. To assess the reversibility of the effect of the desferri-exochelin, we treated quiescent VSMC with desferri-exochelin 772SM for 24 h and then washed the cells and incubated them in fresh medium containing serum and EGF but no exochelin. The cells resumed normal progression through the cell cycle within 12 h, as determined by FACS (Fig.3). Therefore, the cell cycle arrest caused by the desferri-exochelin is reversible. Uptakes of [methyl-3H]thymidine, [5,6-3H]uridine, andl-[4,5-3H]leucine were measured to evaluate the effect of desferri-exochelin on DNA replication, RNA transcription, and protein synthesis, respectively. Quiesced VSMC were stimulated with EGF and serum for 6 h to obtain a synchronous G1 cell population or for 20 h to obtain a synchronous S phase population, as confirmed by FACS. Desferri-exochelin 772SM or vehicle (saline) was added to the synchronized cells for 2 h, and then the appropriate tritiated compound was added for an additional 4 h. There was, as expected, no uptake of [methyl-3H]thymidine in the control or treated cells in G0/G1. The high uptake of [methyl-3H]thymidine seen in control cells in S phase was almost totally blocked by treatment with desferri-exochelin (Fig. 4 a). Desferri-exochelin treatment markedly reduced uptake of [5,6-3H]uridine in both of the synchronized cell populations (Fig. 4 b). In contrast, uptake ofl-[4,5-3H]leucine was similar in control and exochelin-treated VSMC in both populations (Fig. 4 c). Therefore, desferri-exochelin treatment of VSMC inhibits DNA replication in S phase and RNA transcription in both G0/G1 and S phases but does not inhibit protein synthesis within this time frame. Progression through the cell cycle is controlled primarily by the cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) (17.Arellano M. Moreno S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although the protein levels of cyclins vary through the cell cycle, the protein levels of Cdks are relatively constant. Kinase activity of the Cdks is regulated by site-specific phosphorylation and by their association with cyclins or cell cycle inhibitors such as p21 and p27. In G1, cyclin D associates with Cdk4 and Cdk6 to form active kinases that hyperphosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). In late G1/early S phase, cyclin E forms an active complex with Cdk2, which further phosphorylates Rb. As cells progress through S phase, cyclin E is replaced by cyclin A in the active Cdk2 complex. As cells enter M phase, the Cdk2 complex is degraded, and cyclin B and Cdc2 associate to form the active kinase. To assess the effect of the exochelin on the cell cycle regulatory proteins, we stimulated quiesced VSMC with serum and EGF, with or without desferri-exochelin 772SM, and analyzed samples taken at specific time points. The degree of Rb phosphorylation and the level of cyclin proteins and kinase inhibitors were measured by Western blot analysis. The activities of the Cdks were measured using immunoprecipitation kinase assays. When the desferri-exochelin was added to quiesced cells simultaneously with EGF and serum, there were no significant differences between exochelin-treated and untreated cells in the levels of cyclin D, p27, or Cdk4 kinase activity (Fig.5). In contrast, the levels of cyclin E and cyclin A in exochelin-treated cells were reduced compared with control cells (Fig. 6). By densitometric analysis of the Western blots, the cyclin E protein level was reduced by approximately 40% in the exochelin-treated cells at both the 15- and 18-h time points. By 21 h after stimulation, the control cells were entering S phase, and the cyclin E level was decreasing, while cyclin A was increasing. At this point, the exochelin-treated cells had 55% less cyclin A than the untreated cells. The reduced protein levels of cyclins E and A were accompanied by a 50% reduction in Cdk2 kinase activity. In both control and exochelin-treated cells, the Rb protein was progressively phosphorylated starting 8 h after stimulation. However, by densitometry, the percentage of Rb that was hyperphosphorylated after the 15-h time point was decreased in exochelin-treated cells compared with untreated cells. Therefore, the desferri-exochelin does not affect the cyclin D/Cdk4/Rb pathway, but does down-regulate cyclin E/Cdk2 and cyclin A/Cdk2 activity and Rb phosphorylation. In addition, there was a 50–85% reduction in the total amount of Rb protein present in the exochelin-treated cells, which is consistent with a G1 arrest (18.Xu J.-H. Hu S.-X. Benedict W.F. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1139-1146PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 6Down-regulation of cyclin E, cyclin A, and Cdk2 by desferri-exochelin. 50 μm desferri-exochelin 772SM (+) or vehicle (−) was added to quiescent VSMC (0 h) simultaneously with serum and EGF. Cells were harvested at specific time points following treatment, and the protein levels of cyclin E and cyclin A were determined by Western blotting. Cdk2 kinase activity was measured by immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. The protein level and degree of phosphorylation of Rb were determined by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When desferri-exochelin 772SM was added after the cells had reached S phase, the exochelin did not cause a decrease in the amount of cyclin E or cyclin A protein, and Rb was fully phosphorylated, as compared with untreated cells. However, Cdk2 activity was inhibited by at least 55% (Fig. 7). One important S phase substrate of cyclin A/Cdk2 is B-myb. To evaluate the effect of exochelin treatment on the phosphorylation of B-myb in S phase, quiesced cells were stimulated with EGF and serum for 16 h, and then 50 μm exochelin or vehicle was added and cells were harvested at 18, 21, and 24 h, with each sample labeled with32Pi for 2 h before harvesting. By immunoprecipitation of B-myb from these samples and quantification by densitometry, we found that the phosphorylation of B-myb was consistently reduced by 45–50% in the exochelin-treated cells as compared with untreated cells (not shown). The proliferation of VSMC following vascular injury is central to neointima formation and restenosis. Vascular injury during balloon angioplasty induces increased expression of growth factors and cytokines that stimulate the proliferation of VSMC. The mRNA levels of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun are elevated within 15 min of balloon injury in rat aortas and are translated into functional proteins within 2 h (19.Miano J.M. Vlasic N. Tota R.R. Stemerman M.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 715-724PubMed Google Scholar). These early proteins may act as transcription factors for growth factor genes that promote VSMC growth following vascular injury. Replication of VSMC in the medial wall within 24–72 h after injury may represent a shift in cellular phenotype that determines subsequent migration, inflammation, and matrix remodeling that result in restenosis (20.Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Mann M.J. Dzau V.J. Circulation. 1998; 98: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Since the critical events that initiate VSMC proliferation occur within the first few hours after vascular injury (1.Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 208-215PubMed Google Scholar), a pharmacological agent that can effectively block the immediate proliferation of VSMC may inhibit neointima formation. Antagonists to growth factors have been tested as antiproliferative drugs but without significant successin vivo. Recent studies have focused on the cell cycle machinery itself as a target for antiproliferative agents. Increased levels and activation of cell cycle proteins during lesion formation have been demonstrated (21.Wei G.L. Krasinski K. Kearney M. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Andres V. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The importance of Cdks in cell cycle regulation has generated an interest in finding chemical inhibitors of the Cdks. Several strategies have targeted individual gene products with antisense oligonucleotides (22.Simons M. Edelman E.R. DeKeyser J.-L. Langer R. Rosenberg R.D. Nature. 1992; 359: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 23.Speir E. Epstein S.E. Circulation. 1992; 86: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24.Bennett M.R. Anglin S. McEwan J.R. Jagoe R. Newby A.C. Evan G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 820-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) or ribozymes (25.Jarvis T.C. Alby L.J. Beaudry A.A. Wincott F.E. Beigelman L. McSwiggen J.A. Usman N. Stinchcomb D.T. RNA. 1996; 2: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar) in an effort to block signaling pathways. However, the discovery of numerous members of the Cdk and cyclin families suggests that cell cycle regulation is much more complex than a single linear chain of events, with many converging and redundant pathways. Therefore, blocking individual signaling pathways may not effectively prevent cell cycle progression. Iron chelation may provide a broader approach to inhibiting VSMC growth. Iron is an essential element found in all mammalian cells. It is present in the structure of many enzymes and proteins that regulate energy metabolism, respiration and DNA synthesis. In addition, iron participates in redox reactions that generate free radicals. Since H2O2 is involved in the induction of c-fos and c-myc and can directly increase DNA synthesis in VSMC (26.Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a change in the intracellular redox potential may activate signaling pathways for cell proliferation. Iron chelation may inhibit VSMC growth by blocking redox-modulated signaling pathways as well as by inhibiting the activity of various critical enzymes. In these studies, we used a unique lipophilic chelator, desferri-exochelin 772SM, which has a very high affinity for iron and is able to block redox reactions (13.Horwitz L.D. Sherman N.A. Kong Y. Pike A.W. Gobin J. Fennessey P.V. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5263-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In synchronized human VSMC, desferri-exochelin 772SM arrested growth in both G0/G1 and S phases. This growth inhibition was reversible, and there was no cytotoxicity observed after 72 h of treatment. In contrast, the lipid-insoluble iron chelator deferoxamine was able to block growth of VSMC only after a much longer incubation time and at a 10-fold higher concentration. The greater efficacy of desferri-exochelin 772SM is probably due to its lipophilicity. A correlation between lipophilicity and antiproliferative activity has been shown previously for other iron chelators (27.Bergeron R.J. Cavanaugh Jr., P.F. Kline S.J. Hughes Jr., R.G. Elliott G.T. Porter C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The lipophilic property of the desferri-exochelin allows it to enter cells rapidly and may allow it to preferentially chelate iron from critical intracellular sites that are not accessible to lipid-insoluble chelators (13.Horwitz L.D. Sherman N.A. Kong Y. Pike A.W. Gobin J. Fennessey P.V. Horwitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5263-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By chelating iron from pools other than cytosolic free iron, desferri-exochelin may avoid up-regulating transferrin receptors that import iron or inducing release of iron from intracellular ferritin. Treatment with iron chelators in several types of cells has previously been shown to cause cell cycle arrest in either G1 or S phase (3.Kulp K.S. Green S.L. Vulliet P.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4.Lucas J.J. Szepesi A. Domenico J. Takase K. Tordai A. Terada N. Gelfand E.W. Blood. 1995; 86: 2268-2280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Brodie C. Siriwardana G. Lucas J. Schleicher R. Terada N. Szepesi A. Gelfand E. Seligman P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3968-3975PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of chelation varied depending upon both the cell type and the chelator used (5.Brodie C. Siriwardana G. Lucas J. Schleicher R. Terada N. Szepesi A. Gelfand E. Seligman P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3968-3975PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Van Reyk D.M. Sarel S. Hunt N.H. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 7.Kulp K.S. Vulliet P.R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 139: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Some iron chelators produced an irreversible block in cell growth, while others were cytotoxic (6.Van Reyk D.M. Sarel S. Hunt N.H. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28.Ganeshaguru K. Hoffbrand A.V. Grady R.W. Cerami A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Conflicting results were reported regarding which cell cycle proteins were affected by iron chelation. Conditions in our study were optimized by using cells that were growth-synchronized and, unlike cancer cells used in many previous studies, exhibit normal cell cycle regulation. By administering the highly diffusible desferri-exochelin at several points in the cell cycle, we were able to distinguish iron-dependent alterations in cell cycle proteins that normally regulate progression through two critical checkpoints. Desferri-exochelin 772SM specifically blocks growth of VSMC in G0/G1 or S phases but not in G2/M. Therefore, the desferri-exochelin probably does not inhibit a global iron-dependent mechanism, such as respiration or energy metabolism, but targets cell cycle-specific processes. Although RNA transcription in both G1 and S phases is significantly reduced by desferri-exochelin, this may also be a cell cycle-specific effect, since total inhibition of transcription would also block cell growth in G2/M. The cyclin D/Cdk4/Rb pathway is believed to be the major regulator of progression through G1 (29.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). However, VSMC arrested in G1 by desferri-exochelin treatment showed no decrease in cyclin D protein or Cdk4 kinase activity compared with control cells, and the Rb protein was progressively phosphorylated at the early time points. D type cyclins act primarily as growth factor sensors. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D/Cdk4 allows cells to advance beyond the restriction point in G1, after which cells become committed to completing one mitotic division. However, since Rb-negative cells retain some requirements for growth factors, there are probably other pathways that contribute to restriction point control. Chelation of iron by exochelins may be interfering with a G1 signaling pathway that is normally activated by free radicals. Alternatively, there may be a cell cycle checkpoint in G1 that is triggered by a lack of iron. The data do not exclude the possibility that the G1-arrested cells are at the G1/S boundary. This may be the case, based on the lack of an observable effect of the exochelin on the major G1regulatory pathway. Desferri-exochelin added at the time of serum stimulation from quiescence reduces the amount of cyclin E and A proteins present in late G1 and early S phases. The exact mechanism by which iron chelation with exochelin results in a reduced level of cyclins E and A remains to be determined. Although overall protein synthesis does not appear to be affected, the desferri-exochelin may preferentially inhibit the translation of certain mRNAs or reduce the stability of cyclins A and E. The reduced protein levels of cyclins E and A were accompanied by a reduction in Cdk2 kinase activity. This decrease leads to incomplete hyperphosphorylation of Rb, which may be sufficient to block progression of the cells into S phase. Phosphorylation of the Cdc25A phosphatase by cyclin E/Cdk2, which is required for entry into S phase (30.Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the recently described NPAT protein, which promotes S phase entry (31.Zhao J. Dynlacht B. Imai T. Hori T.-A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), may also be insufficient in the presence of the exochelin. The addition of desferri-exochelin to cells that have already entered S phase does not reduce the amount of cyclin E or cyclin A, or the level of Rb phosphorylation. However, the kinase activity of Cdk2 is still inhibited, suggesting that there is a second mechanism by which exochelin affects Cdk2 activity, perhaps by altering the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation state of the Cdk2 kinase. The activity of the S phase transcription factor B-Myb is dependent on phosphorylation by cyclin A/Cdk2 (32.Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2679-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in regulation of cell cycle progression. The reduced phosphorylation of B-myb by Cdk2 may contribute to the S phase arrest induced by the desferri-exochelin. One of the major cellular requirements for iron in late G1and S phase is due to the increased activity of the iron-containing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of nucleotide biosynthesis (33.Eriksson S. Graslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell cycle arrest in S phase and the lack of DNA synthesis in VSMC after treatment with desferri-exochelin 772SM probably result at least in part from inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Blocking DNA synthesis through inactivation of ribonucleotide reductase may activate a checkpoint mechanism that disrupts the Cdk2 pathway to prevent further progression through S phase. Iron chelation by desferri-exochelin arrests the growth of VSMC in both G0/G1 and S phases. By interfering with more than one cell cycle regulatory pathway, desferri-exochelin provides an approach to inhibiting cell growth that is broader and may be more effective than a strategy that targets individual cell cycle proteins. The ability of desferri-exochelin 772SM to reversibly block the growth of VSMC in vitro with no apparent cytotoxicity suggests that exochelin may be useful as a therapeutic agent to prevent or inhibit postangioplasty restenosis.

We have examined the interactions of specific mismatch repair proteins in human nuclear extracts. Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate two complexes as follows: one consisting of hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, and hPMS2 and the other consisting of hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, and hPMS1. These interactions occur without the addition of ATP. Furthermore, the protein complexes specifically bind to mismatched DNA and not to a similar homoduplex oligonucleotide. The protein complex-DNA interactions occur primarily through hMSH6, although hMSH2 can also become cross-linked to the mismatched substrate when not participating in the MMR protein complex. In the presence of ATP the binding of hMSH6 to mismatched DNA is decreased. In addition, hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1 no longer interact with each other or with the hMutSα complex (hMSH2 and hMSH6). However, the ability of hMLH1 to co-immunoprecipitate mismatched DNA increases in the presence of ATP.

Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 2.Kolodner R. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin.

The importance of this mutation avoidance system can be seen in HNPCC1 kindreds, where germ-line mutations in the genes associated with mismatch repair lead to microsatellite instability, elevated mutation rates, and predisposition to cancer (4.Marra G. Boland C.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1114-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 5.Jiricny J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 47-68PubMed Google Scholar). Similar defects in MMR have also been found in spontaneous colon cancers and other solid tumors (6.Orth K. Hung J. Gazdar A. Bowcock A. Mathis J.M. Sambrook J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9495-9499Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although the precise functions of the human MMR proteins are just beginning to be understood, the human MMR genes are homologous to those in the relatively well characterized Escherichia coli MutHLS strand-specific mismatch repair pathway (for review see Ref. 7.Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Indeed, the degree of conservation between such divergent species reflects the essential role of MMR. In bacteria, the MutS protein recognizes mismatches and initiates the repair process. Next, MutS interacts with MutL and translocates along the DNA strand, forming an α-loop structure (8.Allen D.J. Makhow A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This process requires ATP hydrolysis and MutL interaction, although the exact role MutL plays is unclear. Following MutH incision of the unmethylated strand, a segment of DNA is excised by Rec I, exonuclease I, or exonuclease VII, and the DNA is re-synthesized by the polymerase III holoenzyme. In humans, the MMR pathway is more complex than that of E. coli. At least six genes have now been demonstrated to be involved in eukaryotic MMR. These include the MutS homologshMSH2, hMSH6, and hMSH3 and the MutLhomologs hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1 (for reviews see Refs. 9.Fishel R. Kolodner R. Curr. Opin.

It has been shown that a heterodimer of hPMS2 and hMLH1 is capable of restoring mismatch repair activity in human cancer cells that are hMLH1-deficient (21.Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of a hMutLα heterodimer. In addition, a heterodimer of hPMS1 and hMLH1 (hMutLβ) has recently been reported (22.Raschle M. Marra G. Nystrom-Lahti M. Schar P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32368-32375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Based on the E. coli model, it is hypothesized that the MutS and MutL homologs interact in the MMR process. In yeast purified yMSH2, yMLH1, and yPMS1 (homologous to human PMS2) proteins have been demonstrated by gel-shift analysis to interact with heteroduplex DNA (23.Prolla T.A. Pang Q. Alani E. Kolodner R.D. Liskay R.M. Science. 1994; 265: 1091-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In humans the hPMS2 and hMSH2 proteins have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with hMLH1 (24.Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.-M Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The role of ATP in these eukaryotic MutS/MutL homolog interactions is unclear. In yeast the MutS-MutL homologs were reported to interact in the presence and absence of additional ATP (23.Prolla T.A. Pang Q. Alani E. Kolodner R.D. Liskay R.M. Science. 1994; 265: 1091-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas in other studies using purified proteins ATP was necessary to observe the interaction (25.Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In humans, the co-precipitation of hPMS2 and hMSH2 with hMLH1 was observed to occur only in the presence of ATP (24.Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.-M Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the MutL homologs could act to modulate the ATPase activity of the hMutSα heterodimer or that they act as “molecular matchmakers,” recruiting other proteins that function in steps of DNA mispair correction subsequent to mismatch recognition. To determine the exact interactions within nuclear extracts between MMR proteins and oligonucleotide substrates before and after addition of ATP we performed immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays together with UV cross-linking to homoduplex and heteroduplex oligonucleotide substrates. We find that hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, and either hPMS2 or hPMS1 (but not both together) co-immunoprecipitate in the absence of added ATP, indicating the presence of MMR protein complexes consisting of at least four MMR proteins. The protein-protein interactions occur in the presence of both homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA; however, we find that the complex specifically binds only to the mismatched substrate. This binding occurs primarily through hMSH6, although we also observe hMSH2 cross-linked to heteroduplex DNA when not in the larger MMR protein complexes. Addition of ATP results in a marked decrease in the amount of binding of the complexes to the oligonucleotide. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis demonstrates that the protein-protein interaction between hMSH2 and hMSH6 (hMutSα) remains intact but that hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1 no longer associate either with each other or with the hMutSα complex. Interestingly, after the addition of ATP, hMLH1 has an increased ability to co-immunoprecipitate heteroduplex DNA, although it does not become UV cross-linked to it. This suggests that hMLH1 participates in a second protein complex involved in mismatch repair that may be involved in subsequent steps in the repair process. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Dignum et al. (26.Dignum J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with final resuspension in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Antibodies against hMSH2 (polyclonal) were purchased from Oncogene (Cambridge, MA). Antibodies against hMSH6 (polyclonal), hMLH1 (polyclonal), hPMS2 (polyclonal), and hPMS1 (polyclonal) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. A 32-mer oligonucleotide having the sequence of 5′-GGTGGGCGCCGGCGGTGTGGGCAAGAGTGCGC-3′ (Operon; Alameda, CA) was used for these assays with the bold G specifying the location of the mismatch. The oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega; Madison, WI) and purified using a Sephadex G-25 spin column. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was annealed to a complementary oligonucleotide containing a C (homoduplex) or a T (heteroduplex) opposite the bold G, thereby producing double-stranded oligonucleotides with similar specific radioactivities. The annealing was performed at a 1:3 molar ratio of labeled to unlabeled oligonucleotide in a final volume of 100 μl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2. The solution was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature over 2 h. We found no detectable labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides present when these substrates were examined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclear protein-DNA binding reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 165 μg of nuclear extract in a total volume of 200 μl for 30 min at room temperature. A DNA mixture containing 1.05 pmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (either heteroduplex or homoduplex) and 27 pmol of unlabeled double-stranded homoduplex competitor (∼1:25 molar ratio32P-labeled to unlabeled oligonucleotide) was added, and the mixtures were placed on ice for 40 min. All subsequent steps were performed at 0–4 °C. The samples were cross-linked by a 5-min exposure in an UV Stratalinker (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA) and then immunoprecipitated overnight with 3 μg of the indicated antibody. After incubation for 3 h with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation (200 × g, 1 min), washed 2 times with a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.025% NaN3, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, washed 1 time with a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.025% NaN3, and then washed 1 time with a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). Samples were resuspended in an SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and loaded on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis at 10 mA for 2 h, gels were dried and exposed to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Assays involving ATP were performed as above except that ATP at 0.1 mm was added prior to the UV cross-linking step. Nuclear protein was bound to the DNA substrates, UV cross-linked, immunoprecipitated, and electrophoresed as above. The resulting gel was then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. Membranes were blotted with a primary antibody against either hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, hPMS2, or hPMS1. Bound antibodies were detected by ECL detection using a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Between each probe the membrane was stripped by 30 min incubation at 55 °C in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7). To determine the exact nature of the interactions between the MMR proteins, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed followed by Western blotting. HeLa nuclear extracts, which are mismatch repair proficient (27.Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (3741): 3744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were incubated with a mixture of32P-labeled DNA substrate (either homoduplex or heteroduplex), unlabeled homoduplex competitor to control for non-mismatch-specific interactions, and poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (not recognized as a mismatch) to control for nonspecific DNA binding. Use of whole nuclear extracts instead of purified proteins allowed us to search for novel protein interactions. The sequence of the oligonucleotide substrate used was based on that of Ha-raswith the mismatch located at the middle nucleotide of codon 10. Mutations at this location have not been found in any human tumors (28.Bos J.L. Mutat. Res. 1988; 195: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar,29.Kiaris H. Spandidos D.A. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 413-421PubMed Google Scholar), and we have previously demonstrated 96% correct repair of GT mismatches at codon 10 in mammalian cells (30.Matton N. Simonetti J. Williams K. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), lending further support to the mismatch repair proficiency of our system. Nuclear extracts were incubated with the DNA, the bound proteins were UV cross-linked to the oligonucleotides, and immunoprecipitation was performed followed by Western blotting. In Fig.1, antibody against hMSH6 was used for immunoprecipitation, and the resulting membrane was sequentially probed for hMSH6, hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1, with stripping of bound antibody between each probe. As shown in lanes 1 and2 of Fig. 1 B, hMSH6 is capable of co-immunoprecipitating hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1, indicating the existence of an MMR complex(es) consisting of at least these proteins. These protein-protein interactions occur in the absence of additional ATP and occur to an approximately equal extent in the presence of homoduplex or heteroduplex DNA. The protein-protein interactions within nuclear extracts can also be observed when the 32-mer oligonucleotides, both mismatch-containing and homoduplex, were omitted from the reaction (results not shown). As poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was included in all reactions, we cannot conclusively state whether the complexes are pre-formed in the absence of any DNA; however, this is not a relevantin vivo condition for nuclear proteins. In these same experiments, autoradiography was performed on parallel lanes to determine which of the proteins identified above were also capable of becoming UV cross-linked to the 32P-labeled DNA. As seen in Fig. 1 A four bands are observed that bind specifically to heteroduplex DNA (lane 2) and not to the similar homoduplex DNA (lane 1). By comparing the bands seen in Fig. 1 A to those identified in the Western blots in Fig.1 B, it can be seen that the highest molecular weight band runs to approximately the same position on the gel as hMSH6. We believe this to be hMSH6 bound to the mismatched DNA because 1) the size of this band correlates with the predicted molecular mass of 160 kDa for hMSH6, 2) binding to the mismatched DNA is disrupted upon addition of ATP (see Fig. 5), and 3) a number of previous studies have indicated the mismatch-specific DNA binding activity of hMSH6 (13.Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that the predominant mismatch-specific DNA binding activity that we observe within nuclear extracts in these studies is hMSH6. This binding to the DNA occurs only with the mismatched oligonucleotide and is not seen when the 32P-labeled homoduplex substrate is used. We also observe mismatch-specific DNA-binding proteins that run to positions of approximately 115 (A), 95 (B), and 50 kDa (C) (indicated with arrows). These proteins may be components of the complexes involving hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, and hPMS2/hPMS1. Alternatively, as HeLa nuclear extracts are mismatch repair-proficient, these bands may represent proteins that become bound to mismatched DNA in subsequent steps in the repair process. The 115-kDa (A as marked by arrows) activity correlates with the observed positions of both hPMS2 and hPMS1. Further studies are necessary to determine if this band represents a previously undetected DNA binding activity of either the hPMS2 or hPMS1 protein. To confirm that the MMR proteins exist as a protein complex within HeLa nuclear extracts, the above experiments were repeated using antibody against hMLH1 for the immunoprecipitation. Western blotting was then performed with the membrane probed with antibodies against hMSH6, hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS2, and hPMS1. As seen in lanes 1 and2 of Fig. 2 these experiments confirm the interaction between hMLH1 and hMSH2, hMSH6, hPMS2, and hPMS1 in the absence of added ATP. hMLH1 was able to co-immunoprecipitate each of the other proteins in the presence of both homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA in the absence of ATP. Similar co-immunoprecipitation of all the MMR proteins was observed when antibody against hMSH2 was used (results not shown). Interestingly, when antibody against hPMS2 is used for immunoprecipitation, hPMS1 does not co-immunoprecipitate (see Fig. 3). As well, antibody against hPMS1 does not co-immunoprecipitate hPMS2. As we observe co-precipitation of both hPMS2 and hPMS1 when antibodies against hMSH6 (Fig. 1), hMLH1 (Fig. 2) or hMSH2 (results not shown) are used for the initial immunoprecipitation, we conclude that either hPMS2 or hPMS1 exists in the MMR complex but not both together.Figure 3hPMS1 and hPMS2 do not co-precipitate each other. HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with heteroduplex DNA in the absence of ATP, and immunoprecipitation was performed using antibody against hPMS1 (IP ab in lanes 1 and4) or hPMS2 (IP ab in lanes 2 and3). After SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, Western blotting was performed with the indicated antibody probes (Western antibody (ab)). Chemiluminescence was used for detection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Fig. 4 nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled heteroduplex or homoduplex oligonucleotides; the proteins were UV cross-linked to the DNA, and then antibodies against four of the MMR proteins were used for separate immunoprecipitations. The proteins that became UV cross-linked to the labeled oligonucleotides were observed by autoradiography of the resulting gel. The same four proteins (hMSH6, approximately 115 (A), 95 (B), and 50 kDa (C)) became bound to the mismatched DNA and not to the homoduplex DNA when hMSH6, hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS2, or hPMS1 were used for immunoprecipitation. The predominant mismatch-specific DNA binding activity is that of hMSH6 as identified in Fig. 1, regardless of the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. The degree of binding by hMSH6 is greater when antibody against hMSH6 is used in a direct immunoprecipitation than when hMSH6 is co-immunoprecipitated using antibodies against hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS2, or hPMS1. This is the expected result because during the co-immunoprecipitations the protein-protein interactions can be disrupted and thus further confirms that this band represents hMSH6. Alternatively, it is possible that the intensity of this band results from hMSH6 homomultimers bound to the oligonucleotides as well as binding by the larger mismatch repair complexes. However, we consider this to be unlikely as studies using purified hMSH6 have shown it to be incapable of binding to DNA when not interacting with hMSH2 in the hMutSα heterodimer (13.Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The amount of hMSH6 UV cross-linked to the heteroduplex when antibody against hMSH2 is used is greater than that seen when antibody against hPMS1, hPMS2, or hMLH1 is used. This could be because the hMutSα complex alone binds to the mismatched DNA, in addition to the larger MMR complexes, or could reflect the strength of the protein-protein interaction between hMSH2 and hMSH6. When antibody against hMSH2 is used to immunoprecipitate, a unique band is observed of approximately 105 kDa. This corresponds to the known molecular mass of hMSH2 (102 kDa) and runs to approximately the same position as hMSH2 as indicated on the Western blots in Fig. 1 B and Fig. 2. Other investigators have demonstrated purified hMSH2 to be capable of specifically binding to mismatched DNA (31.Fishel R. Ewel A. Lescoe M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5539-5542PubMed Google Scholar). As we cannot co-immunoprecipitate bound hMSH2 with antibodies against any of the other MMR proteins, it appears that hMSH2 in HeLa nuclear extracts does specifically bind to mismatched DNA but only when not associated with hMSH6 or the larger MMR complexes. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled heteroduplex or homoduplex oligonucleotides, and the proteins were UV cross-linked to the DNA as above, except that 0.1 mm ATP was added after incubation of the nuclear extract with the 32P-labeled DNA but prior to UV cross-linking. In Fig. 5, antibodies against hMSH6 and hMLH1 were used to immunoprecipitate proteins UV cross-linked to 32P-labeled heteroduplex DNA with and without addition of ATP. The amount of hMSH6 that is bound to the mismatched substrate clearly decreases upon addition of ATP, regardless of the MMR antibody used for immunoprecipitation. This correlates with previous studies that have shown hMutSα to disassociate from oligonucleotide substrates upon binding of ATP (13.Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16.Hughes M.J. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Gradia S. Acharyo S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 996-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19.Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As well, when antibody against hMSH6 is used for immunoprecipitation after the addition of ATP, the amount of binding to the mismatched DNA by the other three proteins (approximately 115 (A), 95 (B), and 50 kDa (C)) also decreases. Binding by hMSH6 does not completely disappear when antibody against hMSH6 is used for immunoprecipitation in these experiments using 0.1 mmATP. ATP concentrations of 10 mm do, however, completely obliterate hMSH6 binding (results not shown). Interestingly, we detect a novel interaction between hMLH1 and the heteroduplex DNA when ATP is added to the nuclear extract-DNA incubation. As seen by comparing Fig. 5, lanes 5 and6, when ATP is added to an hMLH1 immunoprecipitation, the amount of mismatched oligonucleotide that co-precipitates increases, as evidenced by the increased amount of unbound co-immunoprecipitated oligonucleotide. This occurs specifically with the heteroduplex and not the homoduplex oligonucleotide. This phenomenon does not occur when antibody against any of the other MMR proteins is used. hMLH1 itself (70 kDa) does not become directly UV cross-linked to the DNA as a band at the expected site is not observed. However, the amount of labeled DNA bound to the proteins that run to approximately 95 (B) and 50 kDa (C) does increase. hMLH1, therefore, participates in an interaction with the heteroduplex DNA after addition of ATP. This interaction may include the B and C proteins but does not appear to involve a direct interaction between hMLH1 and the mismatched oligonucleotide. To compare the protein-protein interactions in the MMR complexes after addition of ATP, we also performed immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. As seen in each lane 3 of Fig.1 B, when antibody against hMSH6 is used to immunoprecipitate in the presence of ATP, hPMS2, hPMS1, and hMLH1 no longer co-precipitate. The only protein-protein interaction that remains after addition of ATP is that between hMSH2 and hMSH6. Each lane 3of Fig. 2 demonstrates that hMLH1 no longer co-precipitates any of the MMR proteins after addition of ATP. Similar results were observed when antibodies against hPMS2, hPMS1, and hMSH2 were used for immunoprecipitation with all interactions disrupted after addition of ATP except that between hMSH2 and hMSH6 (results not shown). The lack of binding seen after addition of ATP in Figs. 1 and 2 also confirms that the observed co-immunoprecipitations are the result of specific MMR protein-protein interactions as these are known to be modulated by ATP. To determine MMR protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, we performed UV-cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting using HeLa nuclear extracts. In these studies we have identified protein interactions between the human MutS homologs hMSH2 and hMSH6 and the human MutL homologs hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2. We observe these interactions to occur in the absence of ATP; thus ATP binding or hydrolysis is not a prerequisite for complex formation in HeLa nuclear extracts in these experiments. Although we observe both hPMS2 and hPMS1 in the complex, they do not co-precipitate each other. Thus the MMR complex involves either hPMS2 or hPMS1 but not both together. This is in agreement with a recent publication that describes the hMutLβ complex of hMLH1 and hPMS1 as distinct from the hMutLα complex of hMLH1 and hPMS2 (22.Raschle M. Marra G. Nystrom-Lahti M. Schar P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32368-32375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that either hMutLα or hMutLβ is capable of interacting with hMutSα and binding to mismatched DNA. If these complexes are at least partially functionally redundant, this would explain the rarity of HNPCC kindreds with mutations in hPMS2 or hPMS1 (33.Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). We theorize that these different complexes have distinct, as yet unknown functions in the repair process. The protein-protein interactions in nuclear extracts occur in the presence of both homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA. However, the protein complex binds specifically only to heteroduplex substrates. As previously reported (17.Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), hMSH6 appears to be the predominant DNA-binding protein in this complex, although we also observe binding by proteins that run to approximately 115 (A), 95 (B), and 50 kDa (C). Interestingly, the position of the 115-kDa (A) mismatch binding activity is similar to that of hPMS2 and hPMS1 as identified by Western blotting. Current studies are in progress to determine if either hPMS2 or hPMS1 has an as yet unidentified DNA binding activity that allows it to become UV cross-linked to the heteroduplex DNA when in the MMR protein complex, or perhaps to function in subsequent steps in the repair process. However, we do not see a stronger 115-kDa (A) band when either hPMS2 or hPMS1 is used for direct precipitation as compared with the co-immunoprecipitations. If the 115-kDa (A) band is either hPMS2 or hPMS1, a stronger band would be expected when using antibody directed specifically against the protein, as during co-immunoprecipitation the non-covalent protein-protein interactions are easily disrupted during the immunoprecipitation procedure. This suggests that the 115-kDa (A) band may represent a distinct protein. Interestingly, the position of the B band correlates with the reported 94-kDa molecular mass of human exonuclease 1 (34.Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar). This 5′ → 3′-exonuclease has previously been shown to interact physically with hMSH2 in human nuclear extracts (34.Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar), and genetic studies in yeast have shown the yeast homolog to function in the same epistatic pathway as hMSH2 (35.Skankasi P. Smith G.R. Science. 1995; 267: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36.Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Koldner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7487-7492Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The size of the C band could correlate with one or more of the RPC II, III, IV, and V subunits (37, 36, 40, and 38 kDa, respectively), which are suspected to play a role in MMR through loading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen onto DNA (2.Kolodner R. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). It is also very probable that there are more proteins yet to be identified as necessary for mismatch repair in humans, such as a DNA helicase and a 3′ → 5′-exonuclease (2.Kolodner R. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The identification of the three unknown mismatch binding proteins in our studies is therefore of interest. We also observe hMSH2 to become UV cross-linked to the heteroduplex DNA but only when antibody against hMSH2 is used for direct immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). As this mismatch-specific DNA binding activity of hMSH2 does not co-immunoprecipitate with hMSH6, hMLH1, hPMS2, or hPMS1, we conclude that hMSH2 is able to bind to mismatched DNA but only when it is not participating in the larger MMR complexes identified here. One possibility could be that the hMSH2-protein interaction occurs when hMSH2 is bound to hMSH3 in the hMutSβ heterodimer. Alternatively, as studies with purified hMSH2 have shown it to bind to mismatched oligonucleotides as a homomultimer (31.Fishel R. Ewel A. Lescoe M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5539-5542PubMed Google Scholar), the band we observe could be due to an interaction between hMSH2 homomultimers and the mismatched substrate in nuclear extracts. Further studies are necessary to identify the proteins involved in this interaction and their possible function. After addition of ATP to the mixtures we observed that the protein-protein interaction between hMLH1 and hPMS1 or hPMS2 is disrupted as well as the interaction between these proteins and the hMutSα heterodimer. The only protein-protein interaction that we continue to observe after addition of ATP is that between hMSH2 and hMSH6 (hMutSα). This is in conflict with yeast studies that have reported that the MSH2, MSH6, and PMS1 complex either remains intact upon addition of ATP (23.Prolla T.A. Pang Q. Alani E. Kolodner R.D. Liskay R.M. Science. 1994; 265: 1091-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) or that the protein interactions increase in the presence of ATP (25.Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We believe the most probable explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the previous studies used purified proteins, whereas our experiments were performed using whole nuclear extracts. In the presence of ATP, the MMR-proficient HeLa nuclear extracts can proceed with the repair process resulting in the eventual disruption of the protein-protein interactions. The excess of ATP then prevents formation of the protein complex. Although the reactions were maintained at 0–4 °C throughout, the immunoprecipitations were performed overnight, allowing time for the mismatch repair processes to occur, even at these sub-optimal temperatures. Alternatively, it has been shown in E. coli that the heteroduplex substrate is necessary for MutS and MutL complex formation (37.Galio L. Bouquet C. Brooks P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In our experiments the size of the oligonucleotide substrate used (32-mer) could affect the ability of the MutS and MutL homologs to form a complex with each other and with the DNA after the addition of ATP. Addition of ATP also decreases the amount of hMSH6 that becomes UV cross-linked to the DNA. Numerous studies involving purified hMSH2 and hMSH6 have confirmed that the purified hMutSα heterodimer disassociates from mismatch containing oligonucleotides upon binding of ATP (13.Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16.Hughes M.J. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23876-23882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Gradia S. Acharyo S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 996-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19.Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5 we observe a novel interaction between hMLH1 and the mismatched DNA after the addition of ATP, with hMLH1 capable of co-immunoprecipitating the labeled heteroduplex and not homoduplex DNA. This suggests that hMLH1 participates in a complex that interacts specifically with mismatched DNA after addition of ATP. This complex does not appear to involve hMSH6. hMLH1 does not interact directly with the DNA as it does not become UV cross-linked to the oligonucleotide. Instead, hMLH1 may participate in a novel protein complex in which other proteins bind to the mismatched oligonucleotide. Other investigators (21.Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) have failed to observe direct interactions between mismatch-containing DNA and the purified hMutLα heterodimer. This is understandable if the complex involves additional nuclear proteins that directly interact with the heteroduplex DNA and that have not as yet been identified. We do continue to observe mismatch-specific binding by the proteins that run to approximately 95 (B) and 50 kDa (C), suggesting that they participate in the novel hMLH1 containing complex. Our findings suggest that hMLH1 plays a role in steps in the repair process subsequent to mismatch recognition. Although little is known in regard to the exact biochemical role of hMLH1 in humans, a number of studies in E. coli have shed some light on the subject. One suggested role for MutL is to facilitate the interactions between MutS and the proteins necessary for subsequent steps in the repair process such as MutH and DNA helicase II (7.Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 38.Drotschmann K. Aronshtam A. Fritz H.J. Marinus M.G.

The ability of hMLH1 to participate in the initial complexes involving hMutSα as well as in the novel complex after addition of ATP suggests that it may have an analogous role in human mismatch repair. As well, recent studies have suggested that MutL acts as a molecular chaperone. This hypothesis arises from the observed homology of MutL to the molecular chaperone molecule Hsp90 (42.Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and recent x-ray crystallography studies that have shown it to similarly bind ATP and have a weak ATPase activity (32.Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,43.Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Indeed, upon ATP hydrolysis the E. coli MutL protein was observed to undergo conformational changes that are likely to modulate the interactions between MutL and the other components of the repair machinery. In hMLH1, conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis could result in the different protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that we observe after addition of ATP to the reaction. Genetic analysis of HNPCC kindreds has demonstrated the importance of the hMLH1 gene product in mismatch repair (33.Peltomaki P. Vasen H.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) with approximately 61% of HNPCC kindreds reported as of May, 1999, carrying mutations in thehMLH1 gene. The central role of hMLH1 in both the hMutLα and hMutLβ heterodimers (with hPMS2 and hPMS1, respectively) (21.Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 22.Raschle M. Marra G. Nystrom-Lahti M. Schar P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32368-32375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and in both the MMR complexes described here helps to explain the genetic data. As well, the novel interaction we observe between hMLH1 and heteroduplex DNA suggests that hMLH1 may have a further unique role in steps in MMR subsequent to mismatch recognition. Our results suggest a model for human MMR where the hMutSα heterodimer, in a complex with either hMutLα or hMutLβ, recognizes and binds to mispairs. The formation of these protein-protein complexes occurs in nuclear extracts in the absence of additional ATP. The complex can then stably bind to mismatched DNA, again in the absence of ATP. This protein-DNA complex contains either hPMS2 (hMutLα) or hPMS1 (hMutLβ), suggesting possible distinct functions for each. In the presence of ATP, conformational changes occur resulting in the eventual release of the protein complex from the heteroduplex oligonucleotides and the dissociation of hMLH1 from hMutSα and hPMS2 or hPMS1. hMLH1 is then capable of further interaction with the mismatched DNA in a novel manner, presumably playing a role in subsequent steps in the repair process."

Studies in HepG2 cells showed that binding of AP-1 and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) to AC is required for induction by cAMP, but insulin did not inhibit cAMP-induced PEPCK expression in HepG2 cells. Binding of H4IIe nuclear proteins to an AC element probe was inhibited by antibodies or a consensus site for C/EBP, but not AP-1. Transfection with dominant negative bZIP factors, which prevent endogenous factors from binding to DNA, showed that elimination of cAMP regulatory element-binding protein CREB or C/EBP activity blocked induction by protein kinase A (PKA), whereas elimination of AP-1 activity had no effect. In addition, promoters with multiple CREB sites, or a single CREB site and multiple C/EBP sites, mediated PKA induction, but this was inhibited to no greater extent than basal activity was by insulin. These results indicate that an AC factor other than C/EBP must mediate insulin inhibition. An A-site probe (−265/−247) or a probe across the middle of the AC element (−256/−237) competed for complexes formed by factors other than AP-1 or C/EBP. However, analysis of competitor oligonucleotides and antibodies for candidate factors failed to identify other factors. Scanning mutations throughout the AC element interfered with induction but allowed us to define five overlapping sites for regulatory factors in AC and to design probes binding just one or two factors. Comparison of the protein-DNA complexes formed on these smaller probes revealed that a specific complex present in rat liver and H4IIe cell nuclear extracts differed from those formed by HepG2 cell nuclear extracts. Our results suggest that multiple factors binding the AC element of the C/IRU interact with each other and CREB to regulate PEPCK induction by cAMP and inhibition by insulin and that the unique factor expressed in H4IIe cells is a candidate for involvement in insulin regulation of PKA-induced PEPCK gene transcription.

The primary means of modulating PEPCK activity, which is proportional to the rate at which its gene is transcribed, is through hormonal control of PEPCK gene transcription (1.Sasaki K. Cripe T.P.

In particular, the pancreatic hormones, glucagon and insulin, induce and inhibit PEPCK gene transcription, respectively. Glucagon stimulates the synthesis of cAMP, cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), and PKA phosphorylates the PEPCK promoter-associated cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB) on Ser133, which is necessary but not sufficient for induction of PEPCK transcription (2.Yeagley D. Agati J. Quinn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Insulin activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which activates downstream kinases that have been implicated in inhibition of PEPCK transcription, protein kinase B (3.Liao J. Barthel A. Nakatani K.

However, the transcription factor(s) whose binding or activity is modified by insulin to inhibit glucagon/cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription has not been identified. We recently showed that induction of PEPCK transcription in response to cAMP and inhibition in response to insulin can be reconstituted in H4IIe cells by two promoter elements that form a cAMP/insulin response unit (C/IRU) (2.Yeagley D. Agati J. Quinn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Regulation of induction requires a CREB-binding site and an upstream enhancer, the AC element. The AC element has been characterized in HepG2 cells, where AP-1 and C/EBP bind to a 5′ A-site and 3′ C-site, respectively (7.Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D.

In contrast, transcription from endogenous and exogenous PEPCK promoters in response to both cAMP and insulin is regulated in H4IIe cells, as in vivo (2.Yeagley D. Agati J. Quinn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5.Agati J. Yeagley D. Quinn P. J. Biol.

Therefore, we examined the potential roles of the A-site and C-site and of AP-1 and C/EBP factors in regulating PEPCK induction by cAMP and inhibition by insulin in H4IIe cells. The binding of AP-1 and C/EBP factors, which are abundantly expressed in H4IIe cells, to the AC element was evaluated with competitor oligonucleotides and factor-specific antibodies. The effects of expression of dominant negative mutants of CREB, C/EBP, and AP-1 factors on regulation of PEPCK gene transcription were determined to assess the physiological contributions of these factors. Several factors are predicted to bind to AC, based on the similarity of their recognition sites to the enhancer sequence (13.Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A. Kel O. Ignatieva E. Ananko E. Podkolodnaya O. Kolpakov F. Podkolodny N. Kochanov N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Of particular interest among these were factors that are regulated by phosphorylation or are involved in liver-specific gene expression. We examined the role of several AP-1/CREB family members that are regulated by phosphorylation, including Jun, Fos, JunD, ATF2, and CREB. Several of the HNFs, which contribute to liver-specific expression of PEPCK and other genes (14.Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G. Tao W. Qian X. Pani L. Lai E. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar), have potential binding sites within AC. A potential binding site for NF-Y was also identified, as were sites for HMG/SRY factors. Of particular interest was a potential site for FKHR, whose phosphorylation by protein kinase B has been demonstrated to be responsible for insulin inhibition of basal IGFBP-1 expression (17.Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar,18.Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Involvement of these factors was tested by competition with consensus binding sites and/or antibodies against specific factors. A series of scanning mutations throughout the AC enhancer were analyzed for their effects on function of a minimal PEPCK promoter (AC-G4T) that mediates regulation. All scanning mutations disrupted regulation, indicating that factors associated with several overlapping sites within AC are required for induction by PKA and inhibition of this induction by insulin in H4IIe cells, which recapitulate the pattern of hormonal regulation seen in vivo (1.Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15242-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the competition by oligonucleotides containing scanning mutations allowed us to map the protein recognition sites within AC that are required for regulation and to design smaller probes, binding only one or two factors. These smaller probes were used to compare the binding of nuclear proteins derived from rat liver, H4IIe or HepG2 cells. We found that rat liver and H4IIe nuclear proteins formed a unique complex, not found with HepG2 nuclear proteins, on two related sites within AC. Because this complex forms only in cells in which insulin inhibits cAMP-induced PEPCK expression, the factor forming it is a good candidate for involvement in regulation by insulin. H4IIe cells were grown and transfected as described previously (19.Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were transfected in solution with 10 μg of luciferase (firefly) reporter plus 1 μg of each expression plasmid plus 1 μg of pRL-SV (Renilla luciferase; Promega Corp.) reporter to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. Half of the cells were seeded into each of two 60-mm dishes, one of which served as a control while the other was treated with 10 nm insulin. Where indicated, cells were cotransfected with an expression vector for the catalytic subunit of PKA, obtained from R. Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University) (21.Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 h, the cells were treated with 20% Me2SO for 3 min and washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then medium with or without 10 nm insulin was added for the remaining 20 h. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and lysed, and luciferase activities for the firefly andRenilla luciferase reporters were measured with the dual luciferase kit (Promega), using an ALL Monolight 3010 dual injector luminometer. Variations in PEPCK promoter-firefly luciferase activity caused by variations in transfection efficiency were corrected for by measuring Renilla luciferase activity in the same sample. Values were normalized for transfection efficiency, and the mean was computed for several experiments. Data shown in figures were obtained from independent transfection experiments performed with different preparations of the various plasmids. All figures represent several transfection experiments, each of which was normalized to the untreated control and the data combined for analysis. The number of experiments for each figure is indicated in the figure legends. The CRG (CREB-GAL4 fusion protein) expression vector contains the activation domain of CREB (amino acids 1–277) fused to amino acids 4–147 of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and has been described previously (22.Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKA expression vector, RSV-Cα, contains the cDNA for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (23.Howard P. Day K.H. Kim K.E. Richardson J.

The A-ZIP series of expression vectors has been described before (24.Olive M. Williams S.C. Dezan C. Johnson P.F. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2040-2047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25.Olive M. Krylov D. Echlin D.R. Gardner K. Taparowsky E. Vinson C. J. Biol.

The cDNAs encoding the A-ZIP factors were subcloned into an Rous sarcoma virus expression vector for these studies because the cytomegalovirus promoter of the original expression vector contains several CREs that would have confounded interpretation of these experiments. The PQ-Luc luciferase reporter plasmid is based on the promoterless PGL3-basic vector encoding firefly luciferase, obtained from Promega Corp. and modified to accept PEPCK promoter fragments as described previously (8.Roesler W.J. Simard J. Graham J.G. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14276-14283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PEPCK and G4-PEPCK promoters were described previously (20.Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as were the 5XGT and AC-G4T promoters (2.Yeagley D. Agati J. Quinn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for the A element or C element (see Fig. 2) containing HindIII ends were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and subcloned into AC-G4T-Luc. Oligonucleotides of AC element truncations and clustered point mutations containingHindIII ends were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and subcloned into AC-G4T-Luc and G4-PEPCK-Luc. Promoter fragments containing the desired mutation were sequenced in their entirety prior to transfection and mobility shift analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared from H4IIe cells by a modification of the method of Hurst et al. (27.Hurst H.C. Masson N. Jones N.C. Lee K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6192-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), as described previously (2.Yeagley D. Agati J. Quinn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The double-stranded AC element DNA probe contained HindIII ends (agcttCGGTCAAAGTTTAGTCAATCAAACGTTGTGTAAGGACTCt). The AC element probe was labeled by filling in the overhang with Klenow in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. 10 fmol of radiolabeled DNA probe was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear protein for 15 min at room temperature, as described previously (28.Quinn P.G. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The reactions were electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA; 150V; 3.5 h), which was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. For competition studies, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled, duplex oligonucleotide was mixed with the radiolabeled probe prior to addition of nuclear protein. The competitors used were: AC, same as above; A-site, agcttCGGTCAAAGTTTAGTCAAt; C-site, agcttCAAACGTTGTGTAAGGACTCt; mAC, aggcttTTTAGTCAATCAAACGTTGTt; and the SM series, presented in Fig.4 A. The competitors for wild type FKHR (consensus sites are underlined and bold), CACTAG CAAAACAA AC TTATTTTG AACAC, and its mutant, AmBm, CACTAGCCCCGGGAACTTAGGGGTAACAC, contained the duplicated FKHR sites of the IGFBP-1 promoter (17.Guo S.

Expression of a phosphorylation defective CREB activation domain (CRG-S133A) failed to mediate induction, indicating that CREB phosphorylation is required for regulation. Transcription from a PEPCK promoter under the control of multiple CREB-binding sites (5XGT) provided modest induction, but insulin inhibited this induction to no greater extent than it inhibits basal expression, indicating that, although necessary for induction, CREB does not mediate insulin inhibition. In a similar manner, a promoter containing four copies of the C/EBP site in place of AC mediated modest induction but not insulin inhibition of this induction. Because the C/IRU mediates both induction and inhibition, a factor other than C/EBP, bound at the AC element, must mediate insulin inhibition of PKA-activated transcription. We transfected both H4IIe and HepG2 cells with the same calcium phosphate precipitates, containing PEPCK-Luc −/+, a PKA expression vector, and treated the cells with or without 10 nm insulin to assess hormonal regulation of the PEPCK promoter (Fig. 1 C). In H4IIe cells, transcription of PEPCK-Luc was induced by cotransfection with PKA, and induction was inhibited by concomitant treatment of the cells with insulin. This result is consistent with previous studies of PEPCK gene regulation, using run-on transcription and transfection assays in the H4IIe cell line or determination of mRNA amount in livers from hormone-treated animals (39.Beale E. Andreone T. Koch S. Granner M. Granner D. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 328-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, PEPCK-Luc was strongly induced by PKA, as previously reported (8.Roesler W.J. Simard J. Graham J.G. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14276-14283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, insulin failed to inhibit induction of PEPCK-Luc by PKA in these cells. Because insulin activates apparently identical signaling pathways in these cell lines (17.Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), this result suggested that different factors may mediate regulation in the two cell lines. We examined the binding of H4IIe nuclear proteins to an AC element probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to determine the contribution of AP-1 and C/EBP factors to the pattern of protein-DNA interactions observed with H4IIe cell nuclear extracts. H4IIe nuclear proteins formed 11 discreet complexes with the labeled AC element in EMSA (Fig. 2). To address the nature of the protein-DNA complexes present in the EMSA, we evaluated the ability of oligonucleotides containing various consensus sequences or motifs within the AC element to compete for protein binding (Fig. 2). The AP-1 consensus sequence was ineffective as a competitor for specific complexes formed on the AC element. In contrast, either a C/EBP consensus site or the C-site competed for the same more rapidly migrating protein-DNA complexes (bands 4, 6, and 8–11). In agreement with these results, antibodies directed against Fos and Jun proteins were without effect upon protein-DNA complex formation (TableI). On the other hand, antibody specific for C/EBPα supershifted protein-DNA complexes corresponding to bands 4 and 6, whereas antibody to C/EBPβ supershifted protein-DNA complexes corresponding to bands 4 and 8–11 (Table I). An A-site competitor abrogated formation of the most slowly migrating protein-DNA complexes (bands 1–3). Binding of proteins in complexes represented by bands 5 and 7 was not diminished by either the A-site or C-site competitor. In addition, band 7 was reduced by a competitor derived from the middle of the AC element (mAC), comprising the 3′ half of the A-site and the 5′ half of the C-site, indicating that this central site in AC may be necessary for PEPCK gene regulation.Table IResults of EMSA competition assays using the defined sequence or antibodyPotential siteSequence of competitor oligoaConsensus sequences were obtained by comparing factor binding sites for various promoters with the consensus sites listed in TF Search (13).2 Consensus sites are underlined and bold.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the functional contribution of AP-1 and C/EBP factors to the regulation of PEPCK transcription by cAMP and insulin, dominant negative variants of these factors were transfected into H4IIe cells. Isoforms of transcription factors that contain only the DNA-binding domain compete for factor binding, displacing the endogenous, full-length factor and abrogating regulation by it, as has been demonstrated for both CREB and C/EBP (40.Molina C. Foulkes N. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 41.Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). However, these experiments are confounded by the possibility that the overexpressed DNA-binding domain will displace other factors whose binding sites overlap with the targeted site. In response to this problem, we recently developed a series of dominant negative factors targeting the basic region of the leucine zipper (bZIP) family proteins, of which AP-1, C/EBP, and CREB are members (42.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Proteins of the bZIP family dimerize through their leucine zipper domains and bind to the major groove of DNA through contacts within the adjacent basic regions, as described in the “scissors grip” model (43.Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The dominant negative A-ZIP factors contain an acidic domain complementary in charge distribution to the basic region of the factor targeted (24.Olive M. Williams S.C. Dezan C. Johnson P.F. Vinson C.

As a result, when the A-ZIP factor dimerizes with a wild type factor to form a coiled coil through the leucine zipper region, the respective acidic and basic regions continue the formation of a very stable helical structure that engages the basic region of the wild type factor and prevents it from binding to DNA (24.Olive M.

https://openalex.org/W2021061733,"Activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) is mediated by guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins, which accelerate conversion of inactive ARF-GDP to active ARF-GTP. ARF domain protein (ARD1), a 64-kDa GTPase with a C-terminal ADP-ribosylation factor domain, is localized to lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus. When ARD1 was used as bait to screen a human liver cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system, a cDNA for cytohesin-1, a ∼50-kDa protein with ARF guanine nucleotide-exchange protein activity, was isolated. In this system, ARD1-GDP interacted well with cytohesin-1 but very poorly with cytohesin-2. In agreement, cytohesin-1, but not cytohesin-2, markedly accelerated [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding to ARD1. The effector region of the ARF domain of ARD1 appeared to be critical for the specific interaction with cytohesin-1. Replacement of single amino acids in the Sec7 domains of cytohesin-1 and -2 showed that residue 30 is critical for specificity. In transfected COS-7 cells, overexpressed ARD1 and cytohesin-1 were partially colocalized, as determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. It was concluded that cytohesin-1 is likely to be involved in ARD1 activation, consistent with a role for ARD1 in the regulation of vesicular trafficking.

Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that contains an amphipathic α-helix linked to a β-sheet (7.Amor J.C. Harrison D.H.

Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and that is not present in other members of the Ras superfamily. Myristoylation of the N terminus of ARFs seems to play an important part in their membrane association (9.Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). ARD1 lacks a sequence corresponding to the ARF N-terminal α-helix and myristoylation site. The structural similarity, however, suggests that ARD1 may have a physiological function comparable to that of ARFs.Transport between membrane compartments is achieved by vesicular trafficking using COPI-, COPII-, or clathrin-coated vesicles (10.Kaiser C. Ferro-Novick S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11.LeBorgne R. Hoflack B. Curr. Opin.

Proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum are transported to the Golgi via COPII-coated vesicles. Intra-Golgi transport and bidirectional traffic between the Golgi system and the endoplasmic reticulum is effected through COPI-coated vesicles (12.Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13.Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Clathrin-coated vesicles are involved in transport among the plasma membrane, endosomes, trans-Golgi compartments, and lysosomes (14.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). ARF1 participates in the generation of COPI- and clathrin-coated vesicles, whereas Sar1 has an analogous role in COPII vesicle formation. ARD1 is associated with the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes and presumably functions in transport between these organelles (15.Vitale N. Horiba K. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8613-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The priming event in vesicle formation involves the activation of a GTPase by a specific guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (GEP). Guanine nucleotide exchange on ARD1 is slowed by a centrally located GDP dissociation-inhibitory domain (16.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25077-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the activation of ARD1, like that of ARFs, probably requires its interaction with a GEP. Several ARF GEPs have been identified. They fall into two classes, based on molecular size and sensitivity to inhibition by the fungal fatty acid metabolite brefeldin A (BFA). The family of ∼200-kDa BFA-inhibited ARF GEPs includes mammalian BIG1 and BIG2 (17.Morinaga N. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cytohesins also contain a ∼60-residue N-terminal region and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, which binds phospholipids and could have a regulatory function (reviewed in Ref. 26.Moss J.

The active site is located in the C-terminal portion, and residues critical for catalysis are included in sequences termed motifs 1 and 2, which are highly conserved among ARF GEPs. In a three-dimensional structure of the Sec7 domain of Gea2 associated with a truncated form of human ARF1, amino acids in the switch I and II regions of ARF participate in specific interactions with the Sec7 domain (29.Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Significantly, ARD1 contains all of the critical residues involved in these interactions.The shared identities of sequence and biochemical properties of ARD1 and ARFs prompted us to search for an ARD1 GEP. Here, we provide evidence that ARD1 efficiently and specifically interacts with cytohesin-1, in vitro and in vivo, as shown by a yeast two-hybrid assay. We further identify the critical residues of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 that are involved in these specific interactions.DISCUSSIONIn an attempt to find proteins that interact with ARD1, we identified cytohesin-1, an ARF GEP, as a potential regulator of ARD1 activation. Specific interaction was suggested by the yeast two-hybrid screen, in which cytohesin-2 failed to interact like cytohesin-1 with ARD1. Biochemical characterization identified certain regions of both cytohesin-1 and ARD1 that define specificity for their molecular contacts. Cytohesin-1 was initially characterized as a GEP by its ability to increase guanine nucleotide binding to ARFs of class I, namely ARF1 and ARF3, and also ARD1 (23.Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been difficult, however, to associate this activity of cytohesin-1 with a specific intracellular function. Although effects of cytohesin-1 on the interaction of LFA1 with its ligand ICAM1 (40.Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlman L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) were reported before its GEP activity was recognized (23.Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the relationship between the two remains to be elucidated. Ashery et al. (41.Ashery U. Koch H. Scheuss V. Brose N. Rettig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) recently reported that cytohesin-1 in murine brain participates in functions related to ARF6, although other workers have failed to show that cytohesin-1 efficiently accelerates guanine nucleotide binding to ARF6in vitro (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42.Franco M. Borretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Gould B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological functions of this GEP (and others) are still unclear.Several mammalian ARF GEPs have been cloned, and the proteins have been characterized. These include BFA-insensitive cytohesin-1, cytohesin-2 (ARNO), cytohesin-3 (ARNO3 and GRP1), and EFA6 (43.Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and BFA-inhibited BIG1, BIG2, and GBF1, but additional information is needed regarding the tissue distribution, intracellular localization, and regulatory interactions. Attempts to demonstrate subcellular localization of individual ARFs and GEPs have resulted in differences of opinion, for example, regarding the role of cytohesin-2 (ARNO) as a GEP for ARF6 (44.Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 45.Monier S. Chardin P. Robineau S. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could be the result of differences in assay conditions. However, all of the known ARF GEPs appear to act on ARFs of class I, specifically ARF1 or ARF3. Although GEP activity resides in the Sec7 domain, at least some determinants of substrate recognition clearly exist outside of that region (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It appears that identification of specific ARF/GEP pairs solely by in vitro assays will not be possible until the effects of intracellular conditions on the ARF-GEP interaction are understood much better than they are now.ARD1, originally cloned by screening a cDNA library with an ARF2 cDNA (1.Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), turned out to be a 64-kDa protein with a C-terminal 18-kDa ARF domain. Later, studies identified part of the remaining 46-kDa as a GAP for the ARF domain (2.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which contains a zinc finger motif (31.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2553-2560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interaction between the ARF and GAP domains is mediated in part by the ARF effector region (6.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Association of a GAP with the corresponding effector or switch region of a substrate is not unexpected (46.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). ARD1 residues 426QDEFMQP432, which confer specificity for cytohesin-1, differ distinctly from the corresponding ARF sequences. Furthermore, it has been shown that lysine 38 in ARF1 is critical for ARF1 interactions with either the full-length cytohesin-1 or its Sec7 domain (47.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Patton W.A. Adamik R. Yoo H.-S. Lee F.-J.S. Zhang G.-F. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This residue, which corresponds to lysine-425 ARD1, is present in all of the ARF proteins thus far identified as substrates for the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1. The finding that both the GAP domain of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 interact with the same ARF region suggests that additional structural elements play regulatory roles in these two interactions. For example, the GDP dissociation inhibitory region of ARD1 (6.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

By contrast, cytohesin-2 and its Sec7 domain interacted very poorly. Although the Sec7 domains are highly conserved among cytohesins, there are major amino acid differences at positions 65, 92, and 100 (numbers in cytohesin-1). These residues are situated within the first five α-helices and appear to account for a large part of the functional differences between cytohesin-1 and cytohesin-2. They do not seem to be critical for activity, because their replacement in cytohesin-1 with those of cytohesin-2 did not alter activity with ARF1 as a substrate. Thus, it appears that the motifs 1 and 2 of the Sec7 domain are critical for activity, and the N terminus contributes to specificity. The x-ray structure of the Sec7 domain of yeast Gea2, a BFA-inhibited ARF GEP (20.Peyroche A. Paris S. Jackson C.L.

We found that ARD1(T418N) (ARD1-GDP), but not ARD1(K458I) (ARD1-GTP), associated specifically with cytohesin-1, and all of the data are consistent with the notion that the interaction occurs preferentially with nucleotide-free ARD1, which appears to be true also for GEP interactions of other members of the Ras GTPase superfamily.ARD1, endogenous and overexpressed, had been localized to lysosomes, and to a lesser extent to Golgi membranes, by fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation (15.Vitale N.

In contrast, recombinant cytohesin-1 was distributed more diffusely throughout the cells, perhaps associated with some kind of cytoskeletal structures, but usually not with the homogeneous pattern expected of a cytosolic protein. Colocalization of the two proteins in cells over expressing both was limited and was seen clearly only when ARD1(T418N), which is believed to exist with GDP bound, was used (Fig. 10). The subcellular distribution of cytohesin-1 described here, and its apparent concentration just under the plasma membrane in some cells (data not shown), may reflect its reported interaction with α<β2 integrin and effects on cell adhesion (40.Kolanus W.

How this is related to the postulated role of ARD1 in vesicular transport or trafficking between Golgi and lysosomes (15.Vitale N. Horiba K. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8613-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) remains to be determined. ARD1,1 a 64-kDa member of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of GTPases, is composed of a 46-kDa GAP domain in the N-terminal region and an 18-kDa ARF domain at the C terminus (1.Mishima K.

A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ARFs have been classified into three groups according to their molecular size and sequence identity (3.Tsuchiya M. Price S.R. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All can activate cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase (4.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The ARF domain of ARD1 possesses an effector region similar to that of ARFs (6.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that contains an amphipathic α-helix linked to a β-sheet (7.Amor J.C. Harrison D.H.

Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and that is not present in other members of the Ras superfamily. Myristoylation of the N terminus of ARFs seems to play an important part in their membrane association (9.Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). ARD1 lacks a sequence corresponding to the ARF N-terminal α-helix and myristoylation site. The structural similarity, however, suggests that ARD1 may have a physiological function comparable to that of ARFs. Transport between membrane compartments is achieved by vesicular trafficking using COPI-, COPII-, or clathrin-coated vesicles (10.Kaiser C. Ferro-Novick S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11.LeBorgne R. Hoflack B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12.Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum are transported to the Golgi via COPII-coated vesicles. Intra-Golgi transport and bidirectional traffic between the Golgi system and the endoplasmic reticulum is effected through COPI-coated vesicles (12.Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13.Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Clathrin-coated vesicles are involved in transport among the plasma membrane, endosomes, trans-Golgi compartments, and lysosomes (14.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). ARF1 participates in the generation of COPI- and clathrin-coated vesicles, whereas Sar1 has an analogous role in COPII vesicle formation. ARD1 is associated with the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes and presumably functions in transport between these organelles (15.Vitale N. Horiba K. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8613-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The priming event in vesicle formation involves the activation of a GTPase by a specific guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (GEP). Guanine nucleotide exchange on ARD1 is slowed by a centrally located GDP dissociation-inhibitory domain (16.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25077-25082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the activation of ARD1, like that of ARFs, probably requires its interaction with a GEP. Several ARF GEPs have been identified. They fall into two classes, based on molecular size and sensitivity to inhibition by the fungal fatty acid metabolite brefeldin A (BFA). The family of ∼200-kDa BFA-inhibited ARF GEPs includes mammalian BIG1 and BIG2 (17.Morinaga N. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BFA-insensitive ARF GEPs are members of the ∼50-kDa cytohesin family, which comprises cytohesin-1 (23.Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), cytohesin-2 (also known as ARNO) (24.Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and cytohesin-3 (also known as GRP1) (25.Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C.

All ARF GEPs contain a central, catalytically active Sec7 domain that accelerates guanine nucleotide binding to ARF1. The cytohesins also contain a ∼60-residue N-terminal region and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, which binds phospholipids and could have a regulatory function (reviewed in Ref. 26.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The Sec7 domains of cytohesin-2 (27.Mossessova E. Gulbis J.M. Goldberg J.

The active site is located in the C-terminal portion, and residues critical for catalysis are included in sequences termed motifs 1 and 2, which are highly conserved among ARF GEPs. In a three-dimensional structure of the Sec7 domain of Gea2 associated with a truncated form of human ARF1, amino acids in the switch I and II regions of ARF participate in specific interactions with the Sec7 domain (29.Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Significantly, ARD1 contains all of the critical residues involved in these interactions. The shared identities of sequence and biochemical properties of ARD1 and ARFs prompted us to search for an ARD1 GEP. Here, we provide evidence that ARD1 efficiently and specifically interacts with cytohesin-1, in vitro and in vivo, as shown by a yeast two-hybrid assay. We further identify the critical residues of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 that are involved in these specific interactions. DISCUSSIONIn an attempt to find proteins that interact with ARD1, we identified cytohesin-1, an ARF GEP, as a potential regulator of ARD1 activation. Specific interaction was suggested by the yeast two-hybrid screen, in which cytohesin-2 failed to interact like cytohesin-1 with ARD1. Biochemical characterization identified certain regions of both cytohesin-1 and ARD1 that define specificity for their molecular contacts. Cytohesin-1 was initially characterized as a GEP by its ability to increase guanine nucleotide binding to ARFs of class I, namely ARF1 and ARF3, and also ARD1 (23.Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been difficult, however, to associate this activity of cytohesin-1 with a specific intracellular function. Although effects of cytohesin-1 on the interaction of LFA1 with its ligand ICAM1 (40.Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlman L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) were reported before its GEP activity was recognized (23.Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the relationship between the two remains to be elucidated. Ashery et al. (41.Ashery U. Koch H. Scheuss V. Brose N. Rettig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) recently reported that cytohesin-1 in murine brain participates in functions related to ARF6, although other workers have failed to show that cytohesin-1 efficiently accelerates guanine nucleotide binding to ARF6in vitro (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G.

Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological functions of this GEP (and others) are still unclear.Several mammalian ARF GEPs have been cloned, and the proteins have been characterized. These include BFA-insensitive cytohesin-1, cytohesin-2 (ARNO), cytohesin-3 (ARNO3 and GRP1), and EFA6 (43.Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and BFA-inhibited BIG1, BIG2, and GBF1, but additional information is needed regarding the tissue distribution, intracellular localization, and regulatory interactions. Attempts to demonstrate subcellular localization of individual ARFs and GEPs have resulted in differences of opinion, for example, regarding the role of cytohesin-2 (ARNO) as a GEP for ARF6 (44.Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 45.Monier S. Chardin P. Robineau S. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could be the result of differences in assay conditions. However, all of the known ARF GEPs appear to act on ARFs of class I, specifically ARF1 or ARF3. Although GEP activity resides in the Sec7 domain, at least some determinants of substrate recognition clearly exist outside of that region (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It appears that identification of specific ARF/GEP pairs solely by in vitro assays will not be possible until the effects of intracellular conditions on the ARF-GEP interaction are understood much better than they are now.ARD1, originally cloned by screening a cDNA library with an ARF2 cDNA (1.Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), turned out to be a 64-kDa protein with a C-terminal 18-kDa ARF domain. Later, studies identified part of the remaining 46-kDa as a GAP for the ARF domain (2.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which contains a zinc finger motif (31.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2553-2560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interaction between the ARF and GAP domains is mediated in part by the ARF effector region (6.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Association of a GAP with the corresponding effector or switch region of a substrate is not unexpected (46.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). ARD1 residues 426QDEFMQP432, which confer specificity for cytohesin-1, differ distinctly from the corresponding ARF sequences. Furthermore, it has been shown that lysine 38 in ARF1 is critical for ARF1 interactions with either the full-length cytohesin-1 or its Sec7 domain (47.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Patton W.A. Adamik R. Yoo H.-S. Lee F.-J.S. Zhang G.-F. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This residue, which corresponds to lysine-425 ARD1, is present in all of the ARF proteins thus far identified as substrates for the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1. The finding that both the GAP domain of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 interact with the same ARF region suggests that additional structural elements play regulatory roles in these two interactions. For example, the GDP dissociation inhibitory region of ARD1 (6.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may contribute to this interaction, which seems likely because the equivalent region in ARF1 is required for its interaction with cytohesin-1 (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and BFA-inhibited BIG1, BIG2, and GBF1, but additional information is needed regarding the tissue distribution, intracellular localization, and regulatory interactions. Attempts to demonstrate subcellular localization of individual ARFs and GEPs have resulted in differences of opinion, for example, regarding the role of cytohesin-2 (ARNO) as a GEP for ARF6 (44.Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 45.Monier S. Chardin P. Robineau S. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could be the result of differences in assay conditions. However, all of the known ARF GEPs appear to act on ARFs of class I, specifically ARF1 or ARF3. Although GEP activity resides in the Sec7 domain, at least some determinants of substrate recognition clearly exist outside of that region (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It appears that identification of specific ARF/GEP pairs solely by in vitro assays will not be possible until the effects of intracellular conditions on the ARF-GEP interaction are understood much better than they are now. ARD1, originally cloned by screening a cDNA library with an ARF2 cDNA (1.Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), turned out to be a 64-kDa protein with a C-terminal 18-kDa ARF domain. Later, studies identified part of the remaining 46-kDa as a GAP for the ARF domain (2.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which contains a zinc finger motif (31.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2553-2560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interaction between the ARF and GAP domains is mediated in part by the ARF effector region (6.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Association of a GAP with the corresponding effector or switch region of a substrate is not unexpected (46.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). ARD1 residues 426QDEFMQP432, which confer specificity for cytohesin-1, differ distinctly from the corresponding ARF sequences. Furthermore, it has been shown that lysine 38 in ARF1 is critical for ARF1 interactions with either the full-length cytohesin-1 or its Sec7 domain (47.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Patton W.A. Adamik R. Yoo H.-S. Lee F.-J.S. Zhang G.-F. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This residue, which corresponds to lysine-425 ARD1, is present in all of the ARF proteins thus far identified as substrates for the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1. The finding that both the GAP domain of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 interact with the same ARF region suggests that additional structural elements play regulatory roles in these two interactions. For example, the GDP dissociation inhibitory region of ARD1 (6.Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may contribute to this interaction, which seems likely because the equivalent region in ARF1 is required for its interaction with cytohesin-1 (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The demonstration that a mutant of ARD1 containing only the ARF domain plus the 15 amino acids at its N terminus was a substrate for the intact cytohesin-1 (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is consistent with this view and with the conclusion that multiple regions of the ARD1 molecule are involved in the interaction with cytohesin-1 Sec7. Both cytohesin-1 and its Sec7 domain increased guanine nucleotide binding to full-length ARD1 (33.Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Meacci E. Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26543-26548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By contrast, cytohesin-2 and its Sec7 domain interacted very poorly. Although the Sec7 domains are highly conserved among cytohesins, there are major amino acid differences at positions 65, 92, and 100 (numbers in cytohesin-1). These residues are situated within the first five α-helices and appear to account for a large part of the functional differences between cytohesin-1 and cytohesin-2. They do not seem to be critical for activity, because their replacement in cytohesin-1 with those of cytohesin-2 did not alter activity with ARF1 as a substrate. Thus, it appears that the motifs 1 and 2 of the Sec7 domain are critical for activity, and the N terminus contributes to specificity. The x-ray structure of the Sec7 domain of yeast Gea2, a BFA-inhibited ARF GEP (20.Peyroche A. Paris S. Jackson C.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), co-crystallized with a truncated form of human ARF1, did not reveal extensive interactions of the first five α-helices with ARF1 (48.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We found that ARD1(T418N) (ARD1-GDP), but not ARD1(K458I) (ARD1-GTP), associated specifically with cytohesin-1, and all of the data are consistent with the notion that the interaction occurs preferentially with nucleotide-free ARD1, which appears to be true also for GEP interactions of other members of the Ras GTPase superfamily. ARD1, endogenous and overexpressed, had been localized to lysosomes, and to a lesser extent to Golgi membranes, by fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation (15.Vitale N. Horiba K. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8613-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, recombinant cytohesin-1 was distributed more diffusely throughout the cells, perhaps associated with some kind of cytoskeletal structures, but usually not with the homogeneous pattern expected of a cytosolic protein. Colocalization of the two proteins in cells over expressing both was limited and was seen clearly only when ARD1(T418N), which is believed to exist with GDP bound, was used (Fig. 10). The subcellular distribution of cytohesin-1 described here, and its apparent concentration just under the plasma membrane in some cells (data not shown), may reflect its reported interaction with α<β2 integrin and effects on cell adhesion (40.Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlman L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). How this is related to the postulated role of ARD1 in vesicular transport or trafficking between Golgi and lysosomes (15.Vitale N. Horiba K. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8613-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) remains to be determined. We thank Ronald Adamik for antibodies against the cytohesin-1 Sec7 domain, Dr. Elisabetta Meacci for the cytohesin-2 clone, and Carol Kosh for expert secretarial assistance."

Cell surface expression was increased up to 75% by transfection of HLA-A2 or HLA-B8 heavy chain genes but not genes encoding light chains (β2-microglobulin (β2m)), transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), or tapasin. Interferon (IFN) treatment further increased expression of transfected heavy chains, suggesting that IFN inducible molecules support heavy chain expression. IFN induces β2m, TAP, and tapasin mRNAs. Transfected heavy chain expression increased upon cotransfection with genes encoding TAP1 and TAP2 but not individual TAP subunits, β2m, or tapasin. Tetracycline inducible heavy chain gene expression was also increased by IFN treatment or TAP cotransfection, suggesting that IFN-induced TAP supports heavy chain maturation. Expression of a mutant that does not interact strongly with TAP, HLA-A2-T134K, was also increased by IFN. Inhibition of TAP-dependent peptide transport by ICP47 reduced heavy chain expression. Expression of HLA-A2, but not HLA-B8, was restored in ICP47 cells by HLA-A2-binding (IP-30) signal peptides. However, these peptides did not further increase transfected HLA-A2 expression, suggesting that peptide availability does not limit heavy chain expression in the absence of ICP47.

These results suggest that cytokine-induced TAP supports maturation of HLA class I molecules through combined chaperone and peptide supply functions. human leukocyte antigen β2-microglobulin transporter associated with antigen processing interferon tumor necrosis factor polymerase chain reaction tetracycline thymidine kinase HLA1 class I molecules consist of a polymorphic, transmembrane heavy chain (45 kDa), a monomorphic, water-soluble light chain (12 kDa, also called β2-microglobulin (β2m)), and a tightly bound peptide of 9–12 amino acids (1.Silver M.L. Parker K.C. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 350: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The peptide is typically derived from proteins synthesized within the cytoplasm of the cell and transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where HLA class I molecules fold and mature, by a dedicated transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) (2.Hill A. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An association between TAP and nascent heavy chains is thought to be mediated by an adapter protein called tapasin (3.Grandea III, A.G. Lehner P.J. Cresswell P. Spies T. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Peptides provided by the complex of TAP and tapasin are required, in addition to the structural proteins, for the efficient cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules (3.Grandea III, A.G. Lehner P.J. Cresswell P. Spies T. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5.Spies T. DeMars R. Nature. 1991; 351: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 6.Grandea III, A. Androlewicz M. Athwal R. Geraghty D. Spies T. Science. 1995; 270: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). With the exception of the disease-related allele HLA-B27, human class I molecules do not properly fold and mature in the absence of peptides (7.Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Misfolded HLA class I molecules are specifically moved by a dedicated transporter from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm, where they are degraded by proteasomes (8.Hughes E. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The interferons (IFNs) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) increase cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules by inducing the coordinate expression of the structural heavy chain and light chain genes (9.Johnson D. Pober J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5183-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). IFNs also rapidly increase TAP and TAP-dependent peptide transport (10.Ma W. Lehner P. Cresswell P. Pober J. Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16585-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). IFN induction of the gene encoding the TAP1 subunit of TAP is mediated by IFN-responsive enhancers within the promoter (11.Min W. Pober J. Johnson D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3174-3183PubMed Google Scholar). A sequence similar to the IFN-responsive enhancer has been noted in the tapasin promoter (12.Herberg J. Sgouros J. Jones T. Copeman J. Humphray S. Sheer D. Cresswell P. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), raising the expectation that this gene is also induced by IFN. Coordinate cytokine induction of the structural heavy and light chains, TAP and tapasin, is generally thought to support the efficient maturation of HLA class I molecules and their expression on the cell surface. The functions of β2m, TAP, and tapasin were originally demonstrated by restoring HLA class I expression in null mutant cell lines (3.Grandea III, A.G. Lehner P.J. Cresswell P. Spies T. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5.Spies T. DeMars R. Nature. 1991; 351: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 13.Seong R.H. Clayberger C.A. Krensky A.M. Parnes J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown how physiological levels of these components contribute to the expression of HLA class I molecules. Here, the roles of IFN-induced TAP and tapasin and increased peptide supply in supporting increased expression of HLA class I molecules were investigated by transfecting expression vectors encoding each of these components into HeLa cells. This approach allowed the independent manipulation of these molecules in a more physiological setting. HeLa cells were a gift of Richard Flavell (Yale Medical School) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). The culture was split 1:9 every 3–4 days. HeLa cells were serologically typed as HLA-A3, -A28, -Bw15, and -Bw35 (14.Espmark J.A. Ahlqvist-Roth L. Sarne L. Persson A. Tissue Antigens. 1978; 11: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, a genomic DNA-based typing found HeLa to be HLA-A68 (a subtype of A28) and -B75 (a subtype of B15) but negative for B35 (15.Benham A. Gromme M. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar). Using reverse transcriptase-PCR (16.Johnson D.R. Biedermann B.C. Mook-Kanamori B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 233: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we have identified in the HeLa cells used here the alleles HLA-A*6802, -B*1503 or -B*1537, and -Cw*1604 (not shown). The cytokines TNF-α (recombinant, expressed in Escherichia coli, ∼20 units/ng) and IFN-γ (recombinant, expressed inE. coli, 10 units/ng) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). IFN-β (recombinant, expressed in E. coli, 30 units/ng) was a gift from Biogen (Cambridge, MA). TNF-α (5 ng/ml), IFN-β (1000 units/ml), or IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) were added in small volumes without replacing growth medium. Tetracycline-regulated promoters were induced with doxycycline (1 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). HLA-A2.1 and HLA-B8 expression vectors were gifts of William Biddison (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (17.Winter C. Carreno B. Turner R. Koenig S. Biddison W. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3508-3512PubMed Google Scholar). TAP-1 and TAP-2 expression vectors were gifts of Thomas Spies (Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) (5.Spies T. DeMars R. Nature. 1991; 351: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The HLA and TAP cDNAs are inserted into the RSV.5neo expression vector (18.Long E. Rosen-Bronson S. Karp D. Malnati M. Sekaly R. Jaraquemada D. Hum. Immunol. 1991; 31: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ICP47 was a gift of Eric Hughes (Yale Medical School) (8.Hughes E. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The β2-microglobulin cDNA was PCR-amplified from JY lymphoblastoid cDNA (16.Johnson D.R. Biedermann B.C. Mook-Kanamori B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 233: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with primers hb2m.51 (GACAG CATTC GGGCC GAGA) and hb2m.31 (GCGGC ATCTT CAAAC CTCCA), T/A cloned into pCR2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and then subcloned between theBamHI-XbaI (all restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) sites in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Tapasin cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers TPSN.52 (GTCGC AGCGC CATGA AGTCC C) and TPSN.32 (GATGG TGGCT TCCAC AGGAT G), T/A cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen), then subcloned between theHinDIII-XbaI sites in pCDNA3. The tetracycline-activated transcriptional activator (pUHD172–1neo), the target tetracycline operator upstream of a multiple cloning site (pUHD10–3), and the tetracycline-regulated luciferase construct (pUHC13–3) were obtained from Hermann Bujard (ZMBH, Heidelberg, Germany) (19.Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). HLA-A2 and HLA-B8 were removed from the Rous sarcoma virus vector with the enzymes SalI and HpaI and cloned by blunt end ligation into the EcoRI site of pUHD10–3. HLA-A2 was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from JY cells as described (16.Johnson D.R. Biedermann B.C. Mook-Kanamori B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 233: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cDNA was subcloned from pCR2.1 into pCDNA3.1 between the XbaI-HinDIII sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR with the following oligonucleotides: T134K.51 (CTTGG AAGGC GGCGG ACA) and T134K.31 (CCGCC GCCTT CCAAG AGC) or T134A.51 (CTTGG GCCGC GGCGG ACA) and T134A.31 (CCGCC GCGGC CCAAG AGC) with flanking primers CDNA3.51 and CDNA3.31 as described (16.Johnson D.R. Biedermann B.C. Mook-Kanamori B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 233: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The signal sequence from IP-30 was cloned in front of the human growth hormone gene as follows. The human growth hormone gene was subcloned from pOGH (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA) into pCDNA3.1 between the XbaI-EcoRI sites. The normal human growth hormone signal sequence was replaced in a series of recombinant PCRs with the following overlapping oligos: IP30.31 (CGGCG GTGGG CACGT CCAGC AGCAG CAGGG AGCCT GGGGA GA) and IP30.51 (GTGCC CACCG CCGCC GTGCA GGCCT TCCCA ACCAT TC), IP30.32 (CAGGA ACAGC AGAAG TGGCG ACAGG GAGCC TGGGG A) and IP30.52 (CTTCT GCTGT TCCTG CCACC GCTGC TGCTG CTGGA CGT), IP30.53 (CTTCT GCTGT TCCTG CCACC GCTGC TGCTG CTGCT GGACG T) and IP30.32, IP30.54 (TTGCC CCTGC TGCGA TGACC CTGTC GCCAC TTCTG C) and IP30.34 (CAGCA GGGGC AAAGG TGTGG CGGGA GCCTC GGGAG AA). All oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Keck Biotechnology Laboratory (Yale Medical School). All expression constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Keck). Cells were split 1:3 one day before transfection. One to four hours before transfection, cells were replated at 3 × 105 cells in 2 ml/C-6 well (35 mm2). DNA (3–5 μg) was brought to 110 μl with water, mixed with 15 μl of 2m CaCl2, and then rapidly mixed by vortexing with 125 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline solution (50 mmHEPES, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.28m NaCl, pH 7.05). The resulting precipitate was added dropwise immediately to the cells, and chloroquine was added to 0.8 mm final. After overnight culture, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. Expression was measured after two days except for the tetracycline-regulated transfectants, which were treated on day 2 and analyzed on day 3 (see the legend to Fig. 6). Stable transfectants were selected (0.25 mg/ml G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) and then isolated using cloning cylinders. Expression was determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Total HLA class I expression was measured by staining with W6/32, a monoclonal antibody specific for an invariant framework determinant (20.Parham P. Barnstable C. Bodmer W. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar). HLA-A2 was detected with two monoclonal antibodies: BB7.2 (hybridoma supernatant a gift of Peter Cresswell, Yale Medical School) and MA2.1 (hybridoma obtained from ATCC). HLA-B8 was detected with two monoclonal antibodies: 0201HA and 0402HA (purified antibody purchased from One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA). Briefly, cells were recovered with trypsin and treated (5 × 104 cells) with practically saturating amounts of primary antibody diluted in stain/wash buffer (2% fetal calf serum, 0.01% NaN3, phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h on ice. After washing, cells were stained with fluorescent goat antibody specific for mouse immunoglobulin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Between 2000 and 5000 viable cells were analyzed (FACSort, Becton-Dickinson, Sunnyvale CA) as noted in the figure legends. In many experiments, transfection was monitored by including a luciferase reporter gene in each mixture of DNA (except a negative control). Variations between transfections in any single experiment were sufficiently small that no corrections were made in the immunofluorescence data. Instead, several experiments were combined, where noted in the figure legends, by normalizing responses to untreated cells or control transfections. The observed variations in the expression of the control luciferase genes did not correlate with the differences in HLA class I molecule expression reported here. The protocol and the probe for γ actin have been described in detail (9.Johnson D. Pober J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5183-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The tapasin probe was constructed by subcloning the EcoRI-SacI portion of the tapasin-pCRII (above) into M13mp18 (New England Biolabs). RNA was prepared with a kit (RNeasy, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Briefly, RNA (5 μg) was hybridized overnight to single-stranded,32P-labeled DNA probe in 50% formamide at 43 °C. After digestion with S1 nuclease (300 units/ml, 30 min at 37 °C), the fragments were resolved on a denaturing gel (8% polyacrylamide, 8m urea) that was then dried and exposed to film at −80 °C. The resulting autoradiograph was quantified by densitometry (Computing Densitometer, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Interactions between several proteins are required to produce the stable expression of HLA class I molecules on the cell surface. To test whether these proteins might control or limit the surface expression of HLA class I molecules, cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding heavy chain, light chain (β2m), TAP subunits, or tapasin, and the expression on the cell surface was measured by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. The expression of two different HLA class I molecules, HLA-A2 and -B8, was analyzed to test the generality of the findings and because allelic differences have been noted in peptide binding and protein maturation (15.Benham A. Gromme M. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 83-89PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, HLA-A2 can be expressed at low levels even in TAP null cells because of the binding of signal sequence peptides, such as that of IP-30 (21.Wei M. Cresswell P. Nature. 1992; 356: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and HLA-B8 is intermediate in regard to tapasin dependence (7.Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with expression vectors encoding HLA-A2 or HLA-B8 heavy chains expressed these molecules on their surface (Fig.1). The transient transfection protocol resulted in high transfection efficiency with typically over 50% and often over 80% of the cells expressing the transfected genes (Fig. 1,a and b). This high efficiency allowed the analysis of unseparated populations. The detection of class I heavy chains encoded by transfected genes was reported long ago, but the level of transfected heavy chain expression, relative to the endogenous HLA class I genes, has not been determined. One difficulty in comparing HLA class I expression levels is illustrated by the staining of cells transfected with HLA-A2 or -B8. Two monoclonal antibodies specific for HLA-A2 (BB7.2 and MA2.1) both stain strongly, whereas two monoclonal antibodies specific for HLA-B8 (0201HA and 0402HA) stain weakly (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The potential differences in antibody affinities prevent the use of relative fluorescence intensities for comparing expression of these genes. To compare directly the expression of the transfected and the endogenous class I genes, the cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody that is specific for an invariant “framework” determinant and detects all HLA class I molecules, W6/32 (20.Parham P. Barnstable C. Bodmer W. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar). Staining with W6/32 revealed that HLA-A2-transfected cells expressed ∼30% more HLA class I molecules on their surface and HLA-B8 transfected cells expressed 75% more HLA class I molecules on their surface (Fig.2 a). Therefore, despite the weak staining with antibodies specific for HLA-B8, cells transfected with HLA-B8 actually expressed more HLA class I on their surface than did cells transfected with HLA-A2. Cells transfected with β2m, TAP subunits, or tapasin did not express more HLA class I molecules containing endogenous heavy chains (Fig.2 b), suggesting that the supply of heavy chain alone can regulate surface expression by resting HeLa cells. The experiments above show that constitutive levels of β2m, TAP, and tapasin can support elevated expression of class I heavy chains. To test whether cytokine-induced levels of these proteins contribute to high levels of HLA class I molecule expression, stable transfectants with HLA-A2 or HLA-B8 genes were treated with IFN, and the cell surface expression of class I was measured. Treatment with IFN-γ for 18 h further increased cell surface expression of HLA-A2 and HLA-B8 class I molecules (Fig.3), suggesting that IFN inducible molecules can limit the expression of high levels of heavy chains. Similar results were obtained with IFN-β (data not shown). In addition to enhancing the post-translational maturation of heavy chains, it was possible that IFNs also directly influenced the transcription of transfected heavy chain genes. To measure the influence of IFN on the Rous sarcoma virus promoter contained within the expression vector, transient and stable transfectants with Rous sarcoma virus-driven reporter genes were tested. Expression of a green fluorescent protein reporter gene was slightly reduced by IFN-γ and unchanged by IFN-β treatment in several independent stable clones (not shown). Similar inhibition or unresponsiveness was observed in transient transfectants with luciferase reporter constructs (not shown). These findings rule out a direct induction of the expression vector promoter by IFNs. Tapasin mediates an association between nascent class I heavy chains and TAP that is necessary for the efficient peptide loading and maturation of HLA class I molecules (3.Grandea III, A.G. Lehner P.J. Cresswell P. Spies T. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An interferon responsive enhancer has been noted in the tapasin promoter (12.Herberg J. Sgouros J. Jones T. Copeman J. Humphray S. Sheer D. Cresswell P. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but the response of the tapasin gene to IFN has not been demonstrated. To test whether cytokines induce tapasin, which might contribute to the expression of HLA class I molecules, the IFN induction of tapasin mRNA was tested in an S1 nuclease protection assay. Very low levels of tapasin mRNA were detected in untreated endothelial cells and HeLa cells (Fig.4). Parallel hybridizations with HLA heavy chain probes detected higher levels of heavy chain mRNA expression measured as a fraction of the γ actin probe protected in the same lane (not shown). Upon treatment with IFNs or TNF and especially upon treatment with combined TNF and IFN-β or IFN-γ, tapasin mRNA was strongly induced in both endothelial cells and HeLa cells (>10-fold, Fig. 4). The modest induction of tapasin mRNA by IFN-β in HeLa cells (∼2-fold) suggests that tapasin does not limit increases in HLA class I expression. Additional experiments were designed to test whether increased tapasin contributes to higher levels of HLA class I expression. IFN enhancement of class I expression may be mediated by one or more of the molecules induced by IFN. Cotransfection with the gene encoding the herpes virus protein ICP47, which inhibits TAP-dependent peptide transport (22.Hill A. Jugovic P. York I. Russ G. Bennink J. Yewdell J. Ploegh H. Johnson D. Nature. 1995; 375: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), reduced cell surface expression of endogenous class I genes and transfected heavy chain genes (Fig. 5 a). Moreover, transfection of both TAP1 and TAP2 subunits enhanced expression of cotransfected HLA-A2 and HLA-B8 heavy chain genes (Fig. 5 b). TAP transfection did not increase constitutive expression of class I molecules encoded by endogenous genes (Figs. 2 and 5 b). Transfection with individual TAP subunits, β2m, or tapasin did not increase expression of cotransfected class I genes (not shown), just as they did not increase the expression of endogenous genes (Fig. 2). Together, these results suggest that the maturation of HLA class I heavy chains expressed at higher levels is supported by increases in functional TAP. It is difficult to compare two different transfections, even with internal controls (see “Experimental Procedures”). To develop an expression system in which HLA class I expression and IFN responses could be compared within one transfection, the HLA-A2 and -B8 genes were cloned behind tetracycline (tet)-inducible promoters. Cultures were transfected with tet-HLA-A2 or HLA-B8 and divided into equal parts. These parallel cultures were then used as controls or induced and tested for expression of class I molecules. Expression of HLA-A2 molecules was induced by doxycycline, a more potent analog of tetracycline (Fig.6 a, upper bars). IFN pretreatment enhanced maturation of tet-induced HLA-A2 (middle bars) as did IFN cotreatment (lower bars). IFN enhancement of tet-induced HLA-A2 was not observed in cell cotransfection with TAP (Fig. 6 b), suggesting that IFN enhances tet-regulated HLA class I expression by inducing TAP. The IFN enhancement of heavy chain expression is modest probably because of a strong IFN inhibition of the tet-induced promoter. Inhibition is observed in the response of the tet-induced luciferase reporter gene (tet-luc, Fig. 6 c). IFN also inhibited transcription driven by a constitutive promoter (Sp1 enhancer with the minimal thymidine kinase promoter, Sp1.luc, Fig. 6 d). Therefore, IFN increased the maturation and cell surface expression of the tet-induced HLA-A2 molecules despite inhibiting the transcription of the HLA-A2 gene. Similar results were obtained with the tet-HLA-B8 gene (not shown). These results suggest that despite inhibiting mRNA synthesis, IFN increases expression of tet-induced HLA class I by supporting the maturation of HLA class I molecules. Enhanced expression of class I molecules may be because of a increased supply of peptides and/or a chaperone function provided by TAP. The association of TAP with nascent class I molecules is thought to be mediated by tapasin. To test the importance of this association, an HLA-A2 mutant that does not bind tapasin, T134K (23.Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,24.Peace-Brewer A. Tussey L. Matsui M. Li G. Quinn D. Frelinger J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was transfected along with the wild-type HLA-A2 and a control mutant, T134A. Expression of the tapasin nonbinding T134K mutant was lower than wild type HLA-A2 or T134A in stable transfected cell lines (Fig. 7) and in several transient transfections (not shown). However, IFN treatment increased expression of the T134K mutant equally with the wild-type HLA-A2 or T134A mutant (Fig. 7). Because chaperone function requires association, IFN enhancement appeared to be independent of the TAP-mediated chaperone function of TAP. The association of the T134K mutant with tapasin and TAP could not be detected by immunoprecipitation (23.Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24.Peace-Brewer A. Tussey L. Matsui M. Li G. Quinn D. Frelinger J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To test the dependence of the T134K mutant on TAP-supplied peptides, the Herpes virus gene that blocks TAP-dependent peptide transport, ICP47, was transfected along with wild type and mutant HLA-A2 expression vectors (22.Hill A. Jugovic P. York I. Russ G. Bennink J. Yewdell J. Ploegh H. Johnson D. Nature. 1995; 375: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Transfection of ICP47 blocked expression of cotransfected wild type and mutant HLA-A2 molecules (Fig.8), demonstrating that even the T134K mutant HLA-A2 that does not associate with tapasin is still dependent upon TAP-supplied peptides. To control for nonspecific effects of ICP47, a TAP-independent peptide that binds HLA-A2 was supplied in the form of the IP-30 signal peptide. Fragments of the IP-30 signal peptide have been recovered from the few HLA-A2 molecules found on the surface of TAP mutant cells (21.Wei M. Cresswell P. Nature. 1992; 356: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 25.Henderson R. Michel H. Sakaguchi K. Shabanowitz J. Appella E. Hunt D. Engelhard V. Science. 1992; 255: 1264-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Transfection with a reporter gene encoding the IP-30 signal peptide overcame ICP47 inhibition of wild type and mutant HLA-A2 molecule maturation (Fig. 8). Endogenous HLA class I expression was not restored (Fig. 8), probably because only a small subset of these molecules bind the IP-30 peptide. To test the role of peptide availability in controlling HLA class I expression, an expression vector encoding the IP-30 signal peptide was transfected together with HLA-A2. IP-30 did not increase expression of HLA-A2 (Fig. 9,central bars), suggesting that peptide availability does not normally limit HLA class I maturation. IP-30 peptide did rescue expression of HLA-A2 in cells cotransfected with ICP47. However, HLA-B8 expression blocked by ICP47 cotransfection was not restored by IP-30 cotransfection, demonstrating the specificity of peptide binding. In humans, the protective immune response against intracellular microbes, such as viruses and some bacteria, depends on the cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules (26.Ploegh H. Science. 1998; 280: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 27.de la Salle H. Hanau D. Fricker D. Urlacher A. Kelly A. Salamero J. Powis S. Donato L. Bausinger H. Laforet M. Jeras M. Spehner D. Bieber T. Falkenrodt A. Cazenave J.-P. Trowsdale J. Tongio M.-M. Science. 1994; 265: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Peptides bound by HLA class I molecules are recognized by specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are activated to kill infected cells and release cytokines (28.Guidotti L. Ishikawa T. Hobbs M. Matzke B. Schreiber R. Chisari F. Immunity. 1996; 4: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). The cytokines TNF and the IFNs are present at sites of inflammation and are strong inducers of HLA class I molecule expression (29.Johnson D. Pober J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1322-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cytokine-induced expression of HLA class I molecules is important because elevated HLA class I expression on the cell surface provides better stimulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (30.Cox J.H. Yewdell J.W. Eisenlohr L.C. Johnson P.R. Bennink J.R. Science. 1990; 247: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To design strategies to regulate surface expression of HLA class I molecules, it is necessary to know how the components of the maturation pathway contribute to expression. TAP and tapasin are known from studies with null mutant cell lines to be necessary for the expression of HLA class I molecules. Moreover, TAP and tapasin are coordinately induced by cytokines together with the structural heavy and light chain (β2m) genes (10, 29 and Fig. 3). This study was undertaken to test the importance of cytokine-induced levels of these components. Cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules was increased by transfection with heavy chain genes, but not β2m, TAP, or tapasin genes (Fig. 2). Expression of transfected heavy chain genes was further increased by IFN treatment (Fig. 3) or by cotransfection with both TAP1 and TAP2 (Fig. 5), suggesting that IFN-induced TAP can support higher levels of heavy chain expression. Expression was not increased by cotransfection with β2m or tapasin, suggesting that constitutive levels of these proteins are sufficient to support up to 75% increased heavy chain expression. However, increases in β2m and tapasin expression may be required to support cytokine-induced levels of HLA class I expression, which can result in >10-fold increases (29.Johnson D. Pober J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1322-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, increased TAP function is required to support even relatively modest increases in HLA class I heavy chain expression. Two TAP functions, chaperone and peptide transporter, were examined for their contributions to enhancing HLA class I molecule expression. Peptide availability does not appear to limit maturation of HLA class I molecules because providing additional IP-30 signal peptides, which bind HLA-A2 molecules, did not enhance the expression of transfected HLA-A2 heavy chains (Fig. 9). Additional IP-30 peptides only increased HLA class I molecule expression when TAP-dependent peptide supply was blocked by ICP47 (Figs. 8 and 9). It is still possible that without the coordinate, strong induction of TAP and the resulting increases in the supply of TAP-dependent peptides (10.Ma W. Lehner P. Cresswell P. Pober J. Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16585-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), peptides would limit the even greater increases in HLA class I expression induced by cytokines. To analyze the chaperone activity of TAP, the expression of the T134K mutant of HLA-A2 that does not bind to TAP-associated tapasin was tested (23.Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24.Peace-Brewer A. Tussey L. Matsui M. Li G. Quinn D. Frelinger J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). T134K expression was low in the stable and transient transfectants (Figs. 7 and 8). Expression of the control mutant T134A was nearly normal (Fig. 7), suggesting that this mutant associates with tapasin and that the threonine at position 134 in wild type HLA-A2 does not contribute directly to the tapasin binding site. IFNs increased expression of mutant T134K molecules to the same degree as wild type HLA-A2 molecules (Fig. 7). Tapasin-independent, relatively weak interactions between heavy chains and TAP have been reported (31.Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Direct interactions between heavy chains and TAP molecules are likely to increase in cells transfected with TAP or treated with cytokines and may account for the enhancement of T134K expression by IFNs. TAP-supplied peptides are required for expression of transfected heavy chains but peptides alone do not replace TAP (Fig. 9). The T134K mutant that does not interact with tapasin is probably stabilized by a direct, weak association with TAP. The IFN-enhanced expression of the T134K mutant suggests that TAP increases expression of HLA class I molecules through increases in both peptide supply and chaperone activities. Multiple chaperones are involved in HLA class I expression (32.Kahn-Perles B. Salamero J. Jouans O. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 176-185PubMed Google Scholar). These include the lectins calnexin and calreticulin, which bind anN-linked carbohydrate on the heavy chain, an associated protein disulfide isomerase called ERp57 or ER60, and the immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (33.Nöβner E. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 34.Morrice N.A. Powis S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35.Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that induced HLA class I expression depends upon elevated general chaperones. For example, it has been shown that calnexin is not required for MHC class I molecule expression or MHC class I-dependent antigen presentation (36.Prasad S.A. Yewdell J.W. Porgador A. Sadasivan B. Cresswell P. Bennink J.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules was increased by transfection with genes encoding heavy chains but not genes encoding β2m, TAP, tapasin, or peptides that bind class I molecules. Expression of transfected heavy chain genes was increased by cotransfection with both TAP subunit genes or treatment with IFNs. Expression of a mutant heavy chain that associates weakly with tapasin was also increased by IFN treatment. However, expression of HLA-A2 was not increased by the provision of HLA-A2-binding peptides. Thus, both the TAP functions as a chaperone and as a peptide transporter probably contribute to enhancing expression of HLA class I molecules."

This was achieved by linkage of DNA containing a single tethered thiol to p66/p51 HIV-1 RT containing a site-specific cysteine mutation at residue 258 of the p66 thumb. In addition to defining the structure of a covalently trapped catalytic complex, these authors also demonstrated that the single-stranded template ahead of the polymerase catalytic center is not colinear with the duplex, but rather bends away and extends across the face of the fingers subdomain.

For example, alteration of p66 residues 227 (Phe → Ala) or 234 (Leu → Ala) confer increased fidelity of DNA synthesis (22.Wisniewski M. Palaniappan C. Fu Z. Le Grice S.F.J. Fay P. Bambara R.A. J.

Moreover, deleting 13 amino acids from the p51 C terminus (p66/p51Δ13 RT) selectively eliminates polymerization-independent RNase H activity, despite leaving the RNase H domain of p66 intact (24.Cameron C.E.

Finally, HIV-1 RT harboring a mutation at residue 232 (Tyr → Ala) retains exclusively polymerization-independent RNase H phenotype, which theoretically stems from polymerization-dependent hydrolysis (23.Ghosh M.

Biol. 1996; 257: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) suggests that up to 24 bp of duplex DNA can be accommodated by the combined DNA polymerase and RNase H domains, although these estimates must take into account the size of the probing agents. Lastly, despite the availability of high resolution structures for enzyme complexed with duplex DNA (16.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 19.Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), the manner in which the enzyme accommodates RNA/DNA hybrids and A-form duplex RNA remains to be elucidated. Presently, the only information available on accommodation of RNA/DNA hybrids has been obtained through “localized” hydroxyl radical footprinting, using enzymes where Fe2+ is substituted for Mg2+ at the RNase H catalytic center (29.Gotte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the novelty of this approach, a potential limitation is that it cannot reveal information on mutants altered in metal binding, since these by default will not bind Fe2+. In order to address these issues, we have substituted Cys38and Cys280 of wild type and RNase H-deficient HIV-1 RT with Ser, and thereafter introduced a unique Cys at the extreme p66 C terminus of RNase H-proficient (p66C-,C561/p51C-) and deficient (p66(EQ)C-,C561/p51C-) HIV-1 RT. We show here that these alterations are achieved without compromising enzyme function. The resulting “mono-Cys” RTs were then site specifically acylated with p-azidophenacyl to determine the spatial proximity of template and primer nucleotides in a variety of replication complexes. A unique cross-linking pattern to template and primer nucleotides, and moving in concert with the replicating enzyme, is obtained with duplex DNA. Moreover, subtle alterations in the cross-linking pattern are observed when this substrate is replaced by an RNA-DNA hybrid. Plasmids pRT and p6HRT51 contain sequences encoding p66 and poly-histidine-tagged p51, respectively, of HIV-1 RT (30.Le Grice S.F.J. Naas T. Wohigensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cys → Ser substitutions were introduced at position 38 and 280 of both polypeptides to ensure the absence of native cysteines in subsequent gene products. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify adjacent, overlapping regions of the RT gene using oligonucleotides encoding the Cys38 → Ser mutation. Fragments were purified and a portion of each added to a second polymerase chain reaction to merge the products into a single ∼800-bp DNA. This was inserted into pRT and p6HRT51 as aBamHI-EcoRV restriction fragment to create pRTC38S and p6HRT51C38S. A similar procedure was used to introduce the Cys280 → Ser mutation into these vectors as an EcoRV-HindIII restriction fragment, creating pRTC- and p6HRT51C-. pRTC-,C561 was generated using a mutagenic oligonucleotide to introduce a unique cysteine at the C terminus of the p66 RT gene (C561). pRTE478Q (31.Schatz O. Cromme F. Gruninger-Leitch F. Le Grice S.F.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) served as an alternative polymerase chain reaction template to create the RNase H-deficient variant pRT(EQ)C-,C561. All clones were verified via restriction site analysis and DNA sequencing. p66/p51 heterodimers were reconstituted from strains expressing the modified subunits by previously described protocols (30.Le Grice S.F.J. Naas T. Wohigensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Alternatively, p66 expression cassettes were inserted into p6HRT51C- downstream of p51 to create co-expression vectors. A polylinker containing a SalI restriction site was introduced at a unique HindIII site 3′ to the C terminus of the p51 coding region, and p66 expression cassettes inserted as XhoI-SalI restriction fragments. The protocol for RT construction is summarized in Fig.1. Purification of recombinant RT variants was achieved using a combination of metal chelate (Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose) and ion-exchange (S-Sepharose) chromatography as described previously (32.Le Grice S.F.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Enzyme purity and subunit stoichiometry were evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Purified enzymes were stored at −20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mmEDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was evaluated on a 71-nt DNA template annealed to a 5′-[32P]-end-labeled 36-nt DNA primer as described previously (26.Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Enzyme (10 nm) and template/primer (20 nm) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 min in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mmMgCl2, and 80 mm NaCl. DNA synthesis was initiated by adding dNTPs to a final concentration of 50 μm, and terminated by mixing with urea-based gel loading buffer at the times indicated in the text. RNase H activity was evaluated on a 5′-end-labeled 90-nt RNA annealed to a 36-nt DNA primer (28.Rausch J.R. Wohrl B.M. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Enzyme (50 nm) and template/primer (20 nm) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 min in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 80 mm NaCl. Hydrolysis was initiated by addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 6 mm, and terminated as described above. In both cases, products were fractionated by high voltage electrophoresis through 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea in Tris borate/EDTA buffer and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Each enzyme was dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol to remove dithiothreitol and reduce glycerol content. Immediately prior to conjugation, 4-azidophenacyl bromide (Sigma) was dissolved in molecular biology grade methanol (Fisher Scientific) to a concentration of 40 mm, and diluted to 1 mm in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol. In the same buffer, enzyme and 4-azidophenacyl bromide (4 and 200 μm, respectively) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, then transferred immediately to microdialysis tubes (TuboDialyzer, Research Products International Corp.) for overnight dialysis (4 °C). Derivatization efficiency was evaluated by determining the concentration of free sulfhydryl groups before and after exposure to 4-azidophenacyl bromide using Molecular Probes' Thiol and Sulfide Quantitation Kit. Derivatized enzymes were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Throughout this procedure care was taken to minimize exposure of 4-azidophenacyl bromide or conjugated enzyme to ambient light. The protocol for photocross-linking and piperidine cleavage of cross-linked products was adapted from Dumoulin et al.(33.Dumoulin P. Ebright R.H. Knegtel R. Kaptein R. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4279-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 34.Dumoulin P. Oertel-Buchheit P. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2030-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 5′-[32P]-End-labeled DNA-DNA and RNA-DNA duplexes described in the previous section were incubated with RT derivatives (∼4 μm) in the dark at 37 °C for 20 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 80 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2. In some reactions, nucleotide mixtures containing a dideoxynucleoside triphosphate were included to permit limited primer extension. Reactions were then UV irradiated using a 23 W Fischer Biotech hand-held UV lamp (312 nm) at a distance of 10 cm for 2 min, and denatured by incubation in 1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS at 60 °C for 10 min. Cross-linked complexes were isolated by extraction with Tris-saturated phenol followed by ethanol precipitation of the organic phase. Pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol, vacuum-dried, and resuspended and incubated in 10% piperidine for 30 min at 90 °C to cleave cross-linked DNA. Solutions were then lyophilized to dryness, resuspended in a urea-based gel-loading buffer, and fractionated on 8 or 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Fragment sizes were determined by comparison to DNA sequencing ladders (35.Maxam A. Glibert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of RNase H-DNA complexes was carried out using InsightII software (MSI Corp.) on a Silicon Graphics computer. All energy calculations were performed using the cff91forcefield within the Discover module of InsightII running on a CRAY-J90 supercomputer at NCI-FCRDC. The x-ray crystal structure of HIV-RT of Huang et al. (16.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) was chosen as the starting structure for the modeling and the coordinates for 1rtd were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. Seven nucleotide bases and seven peptide residues were added to the x-ray structure using the Biopolymer module of the InsightII software. Seven nucleotide bases built separately in the B-form were attached to the DNA at the 5′-end and a steepest decent minimization with 1000 iterations was performed to achieve a continuous DNA helix void of any unfavorable stereochemical contacts. Only 2 bp on either side of the base pair at the linkage where the new residues were attached were included in the initial calculations while the rest of the DNA and the entire p66 RT polypeptide were constrained. Seven amino acid residues, GIRKILC, were added to the RNase H C terminus. The first four were modeled based upon the available x-ray structure of HIV-RT structure of Jacobo-Molina et al. (19.Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) The last three residues, ILC, were added individually, and steepest decent energy minimization involving 1000 iterations was performed for each added residue. For this part of the calculations the entire DNA and residues 1 to 540 of the p66 domain were held constrained. Once a stereochemically acceptable model of both the protein and DNA was obtained, a final energy minimization for the entire complex of DNA and p66 was performed using the steepest decent method followed by a conjugate gradient minimization, each involving 1000 iterations. When the modeled structure superimposed on the x-ray structure of Huanget al. (16.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), the overall root mean square deviation between the structures is ∼0.2 Å indicating that the modeled structure does not deviate significantly from the x-ray structure. Prior to evaluating the extent to which the RNase H C terminus could be cross-linked to template and primer nucleotides, it was important to determine whether the modifications we introduced compromised enzyme function. Fig. 2 A illustrates DNA-dependent DNA polymerase profiles obtained with a 71-nt template/36-nt primer used in several of our studies (26.Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A fortuitous feature of this substrate is the presence of an intramolecular hairpin on the template immediately ahead of the template-primer duplex, which evaluates the strand displacement capacity of RT. Although minimal synthesis is required to polymerize through this structure, it has been shown to halt progression of the purified p51 subunits of HIV-1 RT and its equine infectious anemia virus counterpart (36.Wohrl B.M. Howard K.J. Jacques P.S. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8541-8548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as p66/p51 HIV-1 heterodimers harboring mutations in the p66 primer grip (23.Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Rodgers D. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8553-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) following polymerization of 10–15 deoxynucleotides. Clearly, substituting Cys38 and Cys280 of p66 and p51 with Ser (Fig. 2 A, left) does not seriously compromise enzyme activity. Although pausing at the template hairpin is apparent at early time points, this does not represent a major barrier to the replication machinery. The DNA synthesis pattern is likewise minimally affected when Cys-less RTs are modified via introduction of a novel Cys at the p66 C terminus (Fig. 2 A,center). Note that at this stage, a mono-Cys variant of HIV-1 RT with the RNase H-inactivating mutation Glu478 → Gln (31.Schatz O. Cromme F. Gruninger-Leitch F. Le Grice S.F.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was also constructed and evaluated in order to investigate the interaction with RNA/DNA hybrids in the absence of hydrolysis. Similarly, data of Fig. 2 A, right, indicates that wild type and RNase H-deficient RTs retain full activity following covalent tethering of azidophenacyl to Cys561 of the mono-Cys p66 subunit. Since colorimetric evaluation of the amount of free thiol indicated that derivatization was >90%, we can also eliminate the possibility that the DNA polymerase activity we observe reflects a non-derivatized population on enzymes. Although derivatization of mono-Cys RTs was not expected to affect DNA polymerase activity, it was important to confirm that RNase H activity was likewise unimpaired, since minimal alteration of the C terminus of p66 (27.Ghosh M. Howard K.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Hughes S.H. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7068-7076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or p51 (24.Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Rodgers D.W. Le Grice S.F.J. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6700-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) can significantly impair function. RNase H activity was evaluated on a closely related RNA-DNA hybrid whose RNA template was uniquely 5′ end-labeled, the results of which are presented in Fig. 2 B. As previously demonstrated (24.Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Rodgers D.W. Le Grice S.F.J. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6700-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27.Ghosh M. Howard K.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Hughes S.H. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7068-7076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), initial hydrolysis of the 90-nt template, defined by the spatial separation of the DNA polymerase and RNase H catalytic centers (17–18 bp), yields a 71-nt product. With prolonged incubation, polymerization-independent hydrolysis from this site as far as template nucleotide −8 is characterized by accumulation of a 62-nt product. Within experimental error, the profiles presented in Fig. 2 Bindicate that Cys-less, mono-Cys, and azidophenacyl-derivatized enzymes retain full RNase H function. The obvious exceptions to this are the mono-Cys RNase H mutant and its derivatized counterpart. However, it is also important to note that the labeled RNA template undergoes no hydrolysis in the presence of these enzymes, indicating they are free of both ribonuclease A and E. coli RNase H activity. Taken together, the combined data of Fig. 2 demonstrate that derivitization of HIV-1 RT at the C terminus of the RNase H domain can be achieved without perturbing the dimer interface and catalytic centers of the enzyme. In Fig. 3, several RT variants were evaluated for the efficiency and specificity with which they could be cross-linked to the primer strand of duplex DNA used in the experiment reported in Fig. 2 A. Complexes were irradiated at 312 nm to induce formation of azidophenacyl-mediated RT-DNA cross-links. Following phenol extraction and precipitation, cross-linked complexes were re-suspended and incubated in 10% piperidine for 30 min at 90 °C to cleave the DNA specifically at the cross-linked nucleotides. Theoretically, therefore, the amount and size of cleavage products detected by autoradiography should reflect the extent and location of azidophenacyl-mediated cross-links. As anticipated, irradiation and piperidine treatment does not result in primer hydrolysis in the absence of protein (Fig. 3, lane 1). Likewise, when binary complexes containing wild type HIV-1 RT (lane 2) or its azidophenacyl-exposed Cys-less counterpart (lane 3) are similarly treated, no cleavage products are observed. Only binary complexes containing azidophenacyl-derivatized RT (lane 4) or the RNase H-deficient variant (lane 5) yield discrete hydrolysis fragments indicative of site-specific cross-linking. Varying in length from 12 to 15 nt, these fragments position the extreme p66 C terminus in the immediate vicinity of primer nucleotides −21 to −24, which is in excellent agreement with our previous DNase I footprinting data (26.Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27.Ghosh M. Howard K.J. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Hughes S.H. Le Grice S.F.J. J.

Biol. 1996; 257: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, based upon these and other experiments in which DNA is cross-linked to RT but not cleaved (data not shown), we estimate the efficiency of azidophenacyl-mediated cross-linking to be 3–5%, which is consistent with previously published estimates. The specificity of photocross-linking was further evaluated by supplementing binary complexes with deoxynucleoside/dideoxynucleoside triphosphate mixtures permitting limited primer extension (Fig.4 A). This approach was previously applied during chemical (37.Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and enzymatic footprinting studies of HIV-1 replication complexes (26.Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J.

These cells, persistently infected with the temperature-sensitive variant Sendai virus, had primary viral receptors indistinguishable in number and affinity from those of parental susceptible cells. However, they proved to be thoroughly defective in the Sendai virus-mediated membrane fusion. We also found that viral HN protein expressed in the defective cells was responsible for the interference with membrane fusion.

Sendai virus human immunodeficiency virus herpes simplex virus diphtheria toxin fragment A fusogenic liposome buffered salt solution Eagle's minimum essential medium monoclonal antibody replication-competent Sendai virus dithiothreitol fluorescence-activated cell sorter 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Sendai virus (SV)1belongs to the Paramyxoviridae, carrying a nonsegmented, negative strand genomic RNA (15, 384 nucleotides). The viral envelope, made up of a lipid bilayer and two glycoproteins (F and HN), encapsulates the nucleocapsid, consisting of the genomic RNA and three nucleocapsid proteins (NP, P, and L) (1.Galinski M.S. Wechsler S.L. Kingsbury D.W. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 41-82Crossref Google Scholar). In the early stage of infection, SV delivers the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm by fusing its envelope with the cell membrane at neutral pH. SV also induces cell-to-cell fusion under appropriate conditions. These phenomena have been investigated intensively as a model of fusion between biological membranes (2.Okada Y. Methods. Enzymol. 1993; 221: 18-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).SV-mediated membrane fusion consists of two distinguishable stages: the binding of the viral envelope to the cell membrane, and the subsequent fusion between the lipid bilayers. The former stage, mediated by the interaction between viral HN protein and the cell surface receptors containing sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid), is essential for subsequent membrane fusion (3.Markwell M.A. Paulson J.C.

In cultured mammalian cells, gangliosides with terminal sialic acid residues, such as GD1a, GT1b, and GQ1b, have been reported to serve as functional receptors (10.Holmgren J. Svennerholm L.

This protein is initially synthesized as a precursor form (F0), which is then processed by proteolytic cleavage to a mature form consisting of two polypeptides (F1 and F2) (16.Homma M. Ouchi M. J. Virol. 1973; 12: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage exposes a well conserved hydrophobic domain at the N terminus of the F1subunit (17.Gething M.J. White J.M. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2737-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which binds cholesterol (18.Asano K. Asano A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1321-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and plays a principal role in the fusion between lipid bilayers.This simple two-step model has been thought to represent most types of membrane fusion induced by various envelope viruses (19.Lamb R.A. Virology. 1993; 197: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the recent finding that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) require certain cellular factors for infection in addition to specific cell surface receptors (20.Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 21.Margolis L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) offers a new perspective on this process. These cellular factors (co-receptors) are not involved in the primary binding, but their interaction with viral components is essential for membrane fusion.Several lines of evidence suggest that SV may also depend on one or more unidentified cellular factors for membrane fusion, in addition to the primary receptor. For example, Okada and Tadokoro (22.Okada Y. Tadokoro J. Exp. Cell Res. 1963; 32: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that SV could aggregate but not fuse human and murine primary lymphocytes. We also found that SV could bind to but not fuse with human primary B cells and the cell lines derived from B cells (23.Watabe A. Yamaguchi T. Kawanishi T. Uchida E. Eguchi A. Mizuguchi H. Mayumi T. Nakanishi M. Hayakawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1416: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the hypothetical SV co-receptor, if any, is still unknown.To investigate the mechanism of the virus-mediated membrane fusion further, it is important to establish a simple but quantitative fusion assay. In the case of HIV and HSV, expression of Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (20.Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar) and firefly luciferase (24.Deng H. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M. Di Marzio P. Marmon S. Sutton R.E. Hill C.M. Davis C.B. Peiper S.C. Schall T.J. Littman D.R. Landau N.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar) encoded in the recombinant virus genome was used as the index of membrane fusion. In this study, we used the delivery of fragment A of the diphtheria toxin (DTA) as the index. Although DTA is nontoxic as long as it is present in the culture medium (25.Uchida T. Kim J. Yamaizumi M. Miyake Y. Okada Y. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), just one molecule of DTA in the cytoplasm is sufficient to kill the cell through inactivation of elongation factor 2 (26.Yamaizumi M. Mekada E. Uchida T. Okada Y. Cell. 1978; 15: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Therefore, if we can deliver DTA into the cytoplasm through membrane fusion, cytotoxicity becomes a good index of the fusion. For delivery of DTA, we used a unique delivery system named fusogenic liposome (FL). FL has a unilamellar membrane associated with SV envelope glycoproteins and fuses with the cell membrane by the same mechanism as SV (27.Nakanishi M. Mizuguchia H. Ashihara K. Senda T. Akuta T. Okabe J. Nagoshi E. Masago A. Eguchi A. Suzuki Y. Inokuchi H. Watabe A. Ueda S. Hayakawa T. Mayumi T. J. Controlled Release. 1998; 54: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As the empty FL is not toxic, we can estimate the efficiency of SV-mediated membrane fusion from the toxicity of FL encapsulating DTA (FL-DTA) (28.Nakanishi M. Uchida T. Sugawa H. Ishiura M. Okada Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 159: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).We report here on the establishment and biochemical characterization of cell lines that bound SV particles efficiently but that had a defect in SV-mediated membrane fusion. Our results suggest that there is a novel, HN-dependent intermediate stage in SV-mediated membrane fusion.DISCUSSIONMembrane fusion induced by paramyxoviruses has been investigated using various biological and physical approaches. Analysis of the syncytium formation induced by expressing envelope glycoproteins from cloned cDNAs is one of the most popular of these techniques (19.Lamb R.A. Virology. 1993; 197: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This assay has greatly contributed to revealing the function of envelope glycoproteins but has contributed little to uncovering the nature of cellular factors required for the fusion. Therefore, we need another quantitative assay for determining the efficiency of the fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane to obtain the information about critical cellular factors.The fusogenic liposome encapsulating fragment A of diphtheria toxin (FL-DTA) is one of the most effective quantitative tools to assess the efficiency of the fusion between the Sendai virus envelope and the cell membrane. FL is a unique delivery system with an envelope-like unilamellar structure associated with the SV glycoproteins (27.Nakanishi M. Mizuguchia H. Ashihara K. Senda T. Akuta T. Okabe J. Nagoshi E. Masago A. Eguchi A. Suzuki Y. Inokuchi H. Watabe A. Ueda S. Hayakawa T. Mayumi T. J. Controlled Release. 1998; 54: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FL is prepared by fusing a simple lipid vesicle and a SV particle, the genome RNA of which was inactivated in advance, and can deliver its content (proteins and DNA preloaded into the simple liposome) into the cell cytoplasm by fusing its own membrane to the cell membrane (27.Nakanishi M. Mizuguchia H. Ashihara K. Senda T. Akuta T. Okabe J. Nagoshi E. Masago A. Eguchi A. Suzuki Y. Inokuchi H. Watabe A. Ueda S. Hayakawa T. Mayumi T. J. Controlled Release. 1998; 54: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite rational to use FL-DTA as the representative of an SV particle in a membrane fusion assay.In the present study, we report that cells infected persistently withts variant SV were fully resistant to FL-DTA (Fig. 3). We carefully characterized the SV binding property of parental susceptible cells and these defective cells and found that both types of cells could bind the same amount of SV with an indistinguishable high affinity (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with our previous finding that a majority of human peripheral B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes are fully resistant to FL-DTA and that these cells nevertheless can bind FL on their surface efficiently (23.Watabe A. Yamaguchi T. Kawanishi T. Uchida E. Eguchi A. Mizuguchi H. Mayumi T. Nakanishi M. Hayakawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1416: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Combining these results, we concluded that primary binding of the SV particle to the cell membrane was necessary but insufficient for inducing membrane fusion, even when functional F protein was present on the virus particles. This conclusion suggested strongly that in SV-mediated membrane fusion there is a critical intermediate stage that occurs immediately after the adsorption of the SV particle to the cell surface.In the present study, we also found that HN protein, but not F protein, on the cell surface was involved in the interference with SV-mediated membrane fusion. We should note that LL cl.151 cells have primary SV receptors indistinguishable from those of susceptible cells, despite the presence of HN protein with sialidase activity. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that HN protein would interact with some unidentified critical non-receptor molecules (co-receptor) and that the expression of HN protein on the cell surface would interfere with the membrane fusion by suppressing this hypothetical co-receptor. This phenomenon may correspond to the previous finding in HSV that the cell lines expressing glycoprotein D of HSV can bind, but not fuse with, HSV (48.Campadelli-Fiume G. Arsenakis M. Farabegoli F. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 159-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Johnson R.M. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 819-827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HSV, glycoproteins B and C were assigned roles as ligands to a primary receptor (glycosaminoglycan), and glycoprotein D was assigned the role as a ligand to co-receptor molecules (50.McClain D.S. Fuller A.O. Virology. 1994; 198: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HN protein might be a ligand to both the primary receptor and the hypothetical co-receptor, as is envelope glycoprotein gp120/gp41 of HIV (21.Margolis L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).There is accumulating evidence suggesting that paramyxovirus HN protein is not only a binding ligand to cell surface primary receptors, but is also directly involved in membrane fusion. First, several anti-HN monoclonal antibodies interfere in the virus-mediated membrane fusion without affecting the binding of the virus to the cell surface (40.Miura N. Uchida T. Okada Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 141: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,51.Tsurudome M. Yamada A. Hishiyama M. Ito Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 2259-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 52.Portner A. Scroggs R.A. Metzger D.W. Virology. 1987; 158: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 53.Iorio R.M. Glickman R.L. Sheehan J.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1167-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Second, successful syncytium formation usually requires the expression of F protein and the homotypic HN protein in the same cell (54.Morrison T. McQuain C. McGinnes L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 813-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Hu X.L. Ray R. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Horvath C.M. Paterson R.G. Shaughnessy M.A. Wood R. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4564-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the specific interaction between F and HN is essential for fusion (57.Dallocchio F. Tomasi M. Bellini T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The region required for this hypothetical interaction was assigned in the primary structure of some HN protein (58.Bousse T. Takimoto T. Gorman W.L. Takahashi T. Portner A. Virology. 1994; 204: 506-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 59.Tsurudome M. Kawano M. Yuasa T. Tabata N. Nishio M. Komada H. Ito Y. Virology. 1995; 213: 190-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 60.Tanabayashi K. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6112-6118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, analysis of variant HN proteins revealed that the fusion promotion activity can be separated from hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activity (61.Sergel T. McGinnes L.W. Morrison T.G. Virology. 1993; 196: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 62.Sergel T. McGinnes L.W. Peeples M.E. Morrison T.G. Virology. 1993; 193: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fourth, other cell-binding ligands, such as plant lectins, cannot replace the function of HN protein in the membrane fusion (63.Moscona A. Peluso R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are the first to suggest that HN protein might promote fusion through interaction with the cellular components during a critical but previously uncharacterized intermediate stage.We still have little information about the nature of hypothetical co-receptor molecules critical for SV-mediated membrane fusion. We found that the treatment of the cells with trypsin (25 mg/ml) or proteinase K (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at their optimal conditions had no effect on the efficiency of membrane fusion (data not shown). This result suggested that the hypothetical cellular factor is either a non-protein or is an integral membrane protein resistant to proteolytic cleavage. Based on this information, we further analyzed the lipid composition of the cells and identified by mass spectrometry (64.Taki T. Ishikawa D. Handa S. Kasama T. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that the amount of several gangliosides decreased specifically in defective cells (GD2 and GD3 for LLCMK2 cells and GM2 and GM1 for HeLa cells). However, we could neither restore the susceptibility of LL cl.151 cells by adding these gangliosides, nor could we inhibit the susceptibility of LLCMK2 cells by adding antibodies against these gangliosides (data not shown). Therefore, the identification of hypothetical cellular co-receptor of SV-mediated membrane fusion, if any, remains as a future challenge. Further investigation based on our current study should unveil the precise mechanism of Sendai virus-mediated membrane fusion. Sendai virus (SV)1belongs to the Paramyxoviridae, carrying a nonsegmented, negative strand genomic RNA (15, 384 nucleotides). The viral envelope, made up of a lipid bilayer and two glycoproteins (F and HN), encapsulates the nucleocapsid, consisting of the genomic RNA and three nucleocapsid proteins (NP, P, and L) (1.Galinski M.S. Wechsler S.L. Kingsbury D.W. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 41-82Crossref Google Scholar). In the early stage of infection, SV delivers the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm by fusing its envelope with the cell membrane at neutral pH. SV also induces cell-to-cell fusion under appropriate conditions. These phenomena have been investigated intensively as a model of fusion between biological membranes (2.Okada Y. Methods. Enzymol. 1993; 221: 18-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SV-mediated membrane fusion consists of two distinguishable stages: the binding of the viral envelope to the cell membrane, and the subsequent fusion between the lipid bilayers. The former stage, mediated by the interaction between viral HN protein and the cell surface receptors containing sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid), is essential for subsequent membrane fusion (3.Markwell M.A. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5693-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4.Nakanishi M. Uchida T. Kim J. Okada Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 142: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A number of molecules have been assigned to SV receptors, including glycoproteins (5.Wu P.S. Ledeen R.W. Udem S. Isaacson Y.A. J. Virol. 1980; 33: 304-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Suzuki Y. Suzuki T. Matsumoto M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1621-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7.Suzuki T. Harada M.

Virology. 1986; 155: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In cultured mammalian cells, gangliosides with terminal sialic acid residues, such as GD1a, GT1b, and GQ1b, have been reported to serve as functional receptors (10.Holmgren J. Svennerholm L. Elwing H. Fredman P. Strannegard O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1947-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11.Markwell M.A. Svennerholm L. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5406-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The second stage of fusion between the lipid bilayers is triggered by the viral F protein. This protein is initially synthesized as a precursor form (F0), which is then processed by proteolytic cleavage to a mature form consisting of two polypeptides (F1 and F2) (16.Homma M. Ouchi M. J. Virol. 1973; 12: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage exposes a well conserved hydrophobic domain at the N terminus of the F1subunit (17.Gething M.J. White J.M. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2737-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which binds cholesterol (18.Asano K. Asano A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1321-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and plays a principal role in the fusion between lipid bilayers. This simple two-step model has been thought to represent most types of membrane fusion induced by various envelope viruses (19.Lamb R.A. Virology. 1993; 197: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the recent finding that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) require certain cellular factors for infection in addition to specific cell surface receptors (20.Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 21.Margolis L.

Third, analysis of variant HN proteins revealed that the fusion promotion activity can be separated from hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activity (61.Sergel T. McGinnes L.W. Morrison T.G. Virology. 1993; 196: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 62.Sergel T. McGinnes L.W. Peeples M.E. Morrison T.G. Virology. 1993; 193: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fourth, other cell-binding ligands, such as plant lectins, cannot replace the function of HN protein in the membrane fusion (63.Moscona A. Peluso R.W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are the first to suggest that HN protein might promote fusion through interaction with the cellular components during a critical but previously uncharacterized intermediate stage.We still have little information about the nature of hypothetical co-receptor molecules critical for SV-mediated membrane fusion. We found that the treatment of the cells with trypsin (25 mg/ml) or proteinase K (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at their optimal conditions had no effect on the efficiency of membrane fusion (data not shown). This result suggested that the hypothetical cellular factor is either a non-protein or is an integral membrane protein resistant to proteolytic cleavage. Based on this information, we further analyzed the lipid composition of the cells and identified by mass spectrometry (64.Taki T. Ishikawa D. Handa S. Kasama T. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that the amount of several gangliosides decreased specifically in defective cells (GD2 and GD3 for LLCMK2 cells and GM2 and GM1 for HeLa cells). However, we could neither restore the susceptibility of LL cl.151 cells by adding these gangliosides, nor could we inhibit the susceptibility of LLCMK2 cells by adding antibodies against these gangliosides (data not shown). Therefore, the identification of hypothetical cellular co-receptor of SV-mediated membrane fusion, if any, remains as a future challenge. Further investigation based on our current study should unveil the precise mechanism of Sendai virus-mediated membrane fusion. Membrane fusion induced by paramyxoviruses has been investigated using various biological and physical approaches. Analysis of the syncytium formation induced by expressing envelope glycoproteins from cloned cDNAs is one of the most popular of these techniques (19.Lamb R.A. Virology. 1993; 197: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This assay has greatly contributed to revealing the function of envelope glycoproteins but has contributed little to uncovering the nature of cellular factors required for the fusion. Therefore, we need another quantitative assay for determining the efficiency of the fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane to obtain the information about critical cellular factors. The fusogenic liposome encapsulating fragment A of diphtheria toxin (FL-DTA) is one of the most effective quantitative tools to assess the efficiency of the fusion between the Sendai virus envelope and the cell membrane. FL is a unique delivery system with an envelope-like unilamellar structure associated with the SV glycoproteins (27.Nakanishi M. Mizuguchia H. Ashihara K. Senda T. Akuta T. Okabe J. Nagoshi E. Masago A. Eguchi A. Suzuki Y. Inokuchi H. Watabe A. Ueda S. Hayakawa T. Mayumi T. J. Controlled Release. 1998; 54: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FL is prepared by fusing a simple lipid vesicle and a SV particle, the genome RNA of which was inactivated in advance, and can deliver its content (proteins and DNA preloaded into the simple liposome) into the cell cytoplasm by fusing its own membrane to the cell membrane (27.Nakanishi M. Mizuguchia H. Ashihara K. Senda T. Akuta T. Okabe J. Nagoshi E. Masago A. Eguchi A. Suzuki Y. Inokuchi H. Watabe A. Ueda S. Hayakawa T. Mayumi T. J. Controlled Release. 1998; 54: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite rational to use FL-DTA as the representative of an SV particle in a membrane fusion assay. In the present study, we report that cells infected persistently withts variant SV were fully resistant to FL-DTA (Fig. 3). We carefully characterized the SV binding property of parental susceptible cells and these defective cells and found that both types of cells could bind the same amount of SV with an indistinguishable high affinity (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with our previous finding that a majority of human peripheral B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes are fully resistant to FL-DTA and that these cells nevertheless can bind FL on their surface efficiently (23.Watabe A. Yamaguchi T. Kawanishi T. Uchida E. Eguchi A. Mizuguchi H. Mayumi T. Nakanishi M. Hayakawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1416: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Combining these results, we concluded that primary binding of the SV particle to the cell membrane was necessary but insufficient for inducing membrane fusion, even when functional F protein was present on the virus particles. This conclusion suggested strongly that in SV-mediated membrane fusion there is a critical intermediate stage that occurs immediately after the adsorption of the SV particle to the cell surface. In the present study, we also found that HN protein, but not F protein, on the cell surface was involved in the interference with SV-mediated membrane fusion. We should note that LL cl.151 cells have primary SV receptors indistinguishable from those of susceptible cells, despite the presence of HN protein with sialidase activity. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that HN protein would interact with some unidentified critical non-receptor molecules (co-receptor) and that the expression of HN protein on the cell surface would interfere with the membrane fusion by suppressing this hypothetical co-receptor. This phenomenon may correspond to the previous finding in HSV that the cell lines expressing glycoprotein D of HSV can bind, but not fuse with, HSV (48.Campadelli-Fiume G. Arsenakis M. Farabegoli F. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 159-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Johnson R.M. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 819-827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HSV, glycoproteins B and C were assigned roles as ligands to a primary receptor (glycosaminoglycan), and glycoprotein D was assigned the role as a ligand to co-receptor molecules (50.McClain D.S. Fuller A.O. Virology. 1994; 198: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HN protein might be a ligand to both the primary receptor and the hypothetical co-receptor, as is envelope glycoprotein gp120/gp41 of HIV (21.Margolis L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence suggesting that paramyxovirus HN protein is not only a binding ligand to cell surface primary receptors, but is also directly involved in membrane fusion. First, several anti-HN monoclonal antibodies interfere in the virus-mediated membrane fusion without affecting the binding of the virus to the cell surface (40.Miura N. Uchida T. Okada Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 141: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,51.Tsurudome M. Yamada A. Hishiyama M. Ito Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 2259-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 52.Portner A. Scroggs R.A. Metzger D.W. Virology. 1987; 158: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 53.Iorio R.M. Glickman R.L. Sheehan J.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1167-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Second, successful syncytium formation usually requires the expression of F protein and the homotypic HN protein in the same cell (54.Morrison T. McQuain C. McGinnes L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 813-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Hu X.L. Ray R. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Horvath C.M. Paterson R.G. Shaughnessy M.A. Wood R. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4564-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the specific interaction between F and HN is essential for fusion (57.Dallocchio F. Tomasi M. Bellini T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The region required for this hypothetical interaction was assigned in the primary structure of some HN protein (58.Bousse T. Takimoto T. Gorman W.L. Takahashi T. Portner A. Virology. 1994; 204: 506-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 59.Tsurudome M. Kawano M. Yuasa T. Tabata N. Nishio M. Komada H. Ito Y.

https://openalex.org/W2017169861,"Abstract One facet of cytokine signaling is relayed to the nucleus by the activation, through tyrosine phosphorylation, of latent cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family members. It has been demonstrated that the C termini of STATs contain the transactivation domain and are essential for the transactivation of target genes. To better understand the function of the STAT C terminus, we have generated a series of C-terminal mutants in STAT5a and examined their effects on transactivation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and DNA binding. Using GAL4 chimerae with the C terminus of STAT5, we have defined a 12-amino acid region essential for STAT5 transactivation. Surprisingly, deletion of these 12 amino acids in the context of the native STAT5 backbone preserved the overall transcriptional activity of the protein. Further analysis revealed that deletion of this region resulted in hyper-DNA binding activity, thus compensating for the weakened transactivation domain. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that within this 12-amino acid region the acidic residues were non-essential for transactivation. In contrast, the non-acidic residues were crucial for transactivation. Mutating either Phe751 or Leu753 to alanine abolished transactivation suggesting that these residues were essential for connecting STAT5 to the basal transcriptional machinery."
