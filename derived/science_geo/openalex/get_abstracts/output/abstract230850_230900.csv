https://openalex.org/W2040605299,"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a membrane glycoprotein expressed on adenomatous and simple epithelia, where it is involved in homophilic adhesion at the basolateral membrane. Carcinomas strongly overexpress EpCAM through an, as yet, unknown mechanism. Interestingly, otherwise EpCAM-negative squamous epithelia are seen to express EpCAM concomitant with their transformation and de-differentiation. The amount of EpCAM and the number of expressing cells both increase with the grade of dysplasia. Despite an important amount of data correlating the expression of EpCAM with cellular proliferation and de-differentiation, such as the coexpression with Ki-67, a marker for proliferation, it is unknown whether EpCAM may directly contribute to carcinogenesis. Here, we show that EpCAM has a direct impact on cell cycle and proliferation, and the ability to rapidly upregulate the proto-oncogene c-myc and cyclin A/E. Human epithelial 293 cells as well as murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing EpCAM had a decreased requirement for growth factors, enhanced metabolic activity and colony formation capacity. Importantly, the inhibition of EpCAM expression with antisense mRNA led to a strong decrease in proliferation and metabolism in human carcinoma cells. Moreover, domain swapping experiments demonstrated that the intracellular part of EpCAM is necessary and sufficient to transduce the effects described. Thus, the data presented here highlight the role of EpCAM, demonstrating for the first time a direct link to cell cycle and proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1985074478,"Ecdysteroids mediate a wide variety of developmental and physiological events in insects. In the postembryonic development of insects, ecdysone is synthesized in the prothoracic gland (PG). Although many studies have revealed the biochemical and physiological properties of the enzymes for ecdysteroid biosynthesis, most of the molecular identities of these enzymes have not been elucidated. Here we describe an uncharacterized cytochrome P450 gene, designated <i>Cyp306a1</i>, that is essential for ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the PGs of the silkworm <i>Bombyx mori</i> and fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Using the microarray technique for analyzing gene expression profiles in PG cells during <i>Bombyx</i> development, we identified two PG-specific P450 genes whose temporal expression patterns are correlated with changes in ecdysteroid titer during development. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that one of the <i>Bombyx</i> P450 genes belongs to the CYP306A1 subfamily. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of the <i>Drosophila Cyp306a1</i> homolog is essentially the same as that of <i>Bombyx Cyp306a1</i>. We also found that <i>Drosophila Cyp306a1</i> is disrupted in the <i>phantom</i> (<i>phm</i>) mutant, known also as the Halloween mutant. The morphological defects and decreased expression of ecdysone-inducible genes in <i>phm</i> suggest that this mutant cannot produce a high titer of ecdysone. Finally we demonstrate that S2 cells transfected with <i>Cyp306a1</i> convert ketodiol to ketotriol via carbon 25 hydroxylation. These results strongly suggest that CYP306A1 functions as a carbon 25 hydroxylase and has an essential role in ecdysteroid biosynthesis during insect development."
https://openalex.org/W1991020250,"The assembly of the copper sites in cytochrome c oxidase involves a series of accessory proteins, including Cox11, Cox17, and Sco1. The two mitochondrial inner membrane proteins Cox11 and Sco1 are thought to be copper donors to the CuB and CuA sites of cytochrome oxidase, respectively, whereas Cox17 is believed to be the copper donor to Sco1 within the intermembrane space. In this report we show Cox17 is a specific copper donor to both Sco1 and Cox11. Using in vitro studies with purified proteins, we demonstrate direct copper transfer from CuCox17 to Sco1 or Cox11. The transfer is specific because no transfer occurs to heterologous proteins, including bovine serum albumin and carbonic anhydrase. In addition, a C57Y mutant of Cox17 fails to transfer copper to Sco1 but is competent for copper transfer to Cox11. The in vitro transfer studies were corroborated by a yeast cytoplasm expression system. Soluble domains of Sco1 and Cox11, lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence and transmembrane domains, were expressed in the yeast cytoplasm. Metallation of these domains was strictly dependent on the co-expression of Cox17. Thus, Cox17 represents a novel copper chaperone that delivers copper to two proteins.

Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) 1The abbreviations used are: CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Sod1, superoxide dismutase. is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain within the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mammalian CcO consists of 13 polypeptide subunits, 3 of which (Cox1-Cox3) are encoded by the mitochondrial genome with the remaining 10 subunits encoded by the nuclear genome (1Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In addition to the subunits, over 30 distinct proteins are important for the assembly of CcO (3Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of these accessory proteins are important in the processing and translation of COX1-COX3 mRNA transcripts, in chaperoning the assembly process, and in the synthesis or delivery of cofactors. The cofactors in CcO include two copper sites (CuA and CuB), two heme A moieties, and a magnesium and zinc ion (4Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The assembly of the two copper sites will be reviewed because that is the focus of the present study. Cox2 requires two copper ions in the binuclear CuA site, and Cox1 requires one copper ion in the CuB site that exists within a Cu-heme A binuclear center. Because both Cox1 and Cox2 are synthesized inside the mitochondria, the three Cu atoms must be imported from the cytoplasm. Four proteins (Cox11, Cox17, Cox19, and Sco1) have been implicated in copper ion delivery and insertion into CcO (reviewed in Ref. 5Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The first protein implicated in copper ion delivery to newly synthesized CcO was Cox17 (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Yeast harboring a mutant cox17–1 were shown to be deficient in respiratory growth and CcO activity, but these phenotypes were reversed by the addition of 0.4% copper salts to the growth medium (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Among a collection of yeast respiratory-deficient mutants defective in cytochrome c oxidase activity, only cox17–1 cells were suppressed by exogenous copper, suggesting a role for Cox17 in copper ion metallation of CcO. Sco1 was first implicated in the copper delivery pathway to CcO by the observation that the respiratory-deficient phenotype of a cox17–1 strain was suppressed by overexpression of SCO1 (7Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sco1 is an integral inner membrane (IM) protein that is tethered to the IM by a single transmembrane helix and contains a globular domain, projecting into the intermembrane space (IMS) (8Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Null sco1 cells, like cox17Δ cells, are respiratory-deficient and have diminished CcO activity. Unlike cox17Δ cells, these phenotypes are not reversed in yeast by the addition of exogenous copper. The role of Cox11 in CuB site formation was suggested by the observation that CcO isolated from Rhodobacter sphaeroides cox11Δ cells lacked CuB and Mg(II) but contained the other cofactors (10Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Yeast lacking Cox11 are devoid of CcO activity (11Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cox11 is also an intrinsic IM protein tethered by a transmembrane helix. A fourth protein, Cox19, is implicated in copper metallation of CcO by virtue of its limited sequence similarity with Cox17 (12Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C.B. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking Cox19 are respiratory-deficient, but this phenotype is not reversed by the addition of exogenous copper salts. The roles of Cox17, Sco1, and Cox11 in copper metallation of CcO were substantiated by the observation that each protein is a Cu(I)-binding protein and that mutations that abrogate in vivo function attenuate Cu(I) binding (11Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (37587): 37582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cox17 is a soluble protein that localizes within the IMS and also within the cytoplasm (8Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The dual localization of Cox17 suggested that it served as a copper ion shuttle to the mitochondrion. However, we recently demonstrated that Cox17 is fully functional if tethered to the IM by a heterologous transmembrane domain (16Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The pathway of copper ion delivery to CcO has not been resolved. Sco1 was proposed to mediate the transfer of Cu(I) ions from Cox17 to the CuA site in Cox2 (17Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22185-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The observation that Sco1 and Cox2 interact supports this model (18Lode A. Kuschel M. Paret C. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 448: 1-6Google Scholar). Cox17 has not been shown to interact with any of these proteins, so its role as a copper donor to Sco1 and/or Cox11 remains unsubstantiated. Cox19, like Cox17, is a small soluble protein within the IMS, so it may also have a copper transfer function. However, nothing is known of which step in the CcO assembly is affected by Cox19. Three of the seven cysteine residues in the 69-residue Cox17 are in a CCXC motif that is important for Cu(I) binding (13Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (37587): 37582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Multiple Cu(I) ions bind to Cox17 within a polycuprous-thiolate cluster that stabilizes a mixture of dimers and tetramers (14Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A second functional domain in Cox17 lies near the C terminus. The original cox17–1 mutation creates a C57Y substitution that abrogates in vivo function without compromising either Cu(I) binding or oligomerization. Studies with C-terminal domain Cox17 mutants suggest a role in mitochondrial retention, perhaps docking with another molecule (16Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The two IM proteins Sco1 and Cox11 are postulated to be the direct copper donors to Cox2 and Cox1, respectively. Both Sco1 and Cox11 have soluble domains that project into the IMS. Sco1 has a conserved CXXXC sequence motif that together with a conserved His residue forms the Cu(I) binding site (15Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The structure of the Bacillus subtilis Sco1 reveals that these two essential Cys residues lie within an exposed β-hairpin loop (19Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Cioffi-Baffoni S. Structure. 2003; 11: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We predict that the single Cu(I) ion coordinated to Sco1 is solvent-exposed and poised for a ligand exchange transfer reaction. Cox11 coordinates Cu(I) by three cysteinyl residues (11Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these Cys residues reduces Cu(I) binding and abrogates CcO activity. The postulate that Sco1 and Cox11 mediate copper ion insertion into Cox2 and Cox1, respectively, is consistent with protein-mediated copper metallation of other yeast proteins. Copper insertion into Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1) in yeast requires the function of the Ccs1 metallochaperone (20Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 21Schmidt P.J. Ramos-Gomez M. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36952-36956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ccc2, a P-type ATPase copper ion transporter, receives copper ions from the Atx1 metallochaperone (22Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 23Lin S.-J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V.O. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 24Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V.O. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). With both Sod1 and Ccc2, copper transfer occurs via ligand exchange reactions in protein-protein complexes of the target protein and its specific metallochaperone. Thus, the prediction is that putative copper transfer from Sco1 to Cox2 and Cox11 to Cox1 is mediated through protein-protein interactions. Likewise, copper ion metallation of Sco1 and Cox11 is expected to occur in protein-mediated reactions. At least two major questions remain: the identity of the copper donor(s) to Sco1 and Cox11 and the mechanism of copper routing to the mitochondrial IMS. In this report we have addressed the first major question and demonstrate for the first time that Cox17 is the specific copper donor to both Sco1 and Cox11. Yeast Strains—A wild-type W303 strain (MAT a, ade2–1, his3–1,15, leu2,3,112, trp1–1, ura3–1) and isogenic cox17Δ variant (6Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) were used for all experiments. Yeast strains were cultured on plates or in liquid in complete medium lacking uracil for pYEF2 selection or lacking leucine for pRS315 selection. Cells were cultured with glucose, raffinose, or galactose as carbon sources as specified under “Results.” DNA transformations were performed using a lithium acetate protocol. Plasmids—SCO1 corresponding to codons 95–296 fused to a 5′ sequence encoding a His purification tag was amplified from pTNDW4 (15Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) by PCR with NotI and EcoRI restriction sites added to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Likewise, mutant SCO1 encoding the same segment with the mutation (C148A,C152A) was amplified from pTNDW4–148,152 with NotI and EcoRI terminal sites. The truncated SCO1 genes were subcloned into pYEF2 containing the GAL1 promoter and CYC1 terminator for transformation of W303 cells (25Cullin C. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Yeast. 1994; 10: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The plasmid is designated YEp-GAL1-SCO1. A fusion of thioredoxin and COX11 lacking the first 300 base pairs of the open reading frame was PCR-amplified from the pET32a vector pHCDW4 (11Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pYEF2, creating plasmid YEp-GAL1-COX11. DNA encoding a Cox11 mutant with a triple alanine substitution of Cys-111, Cys-208, and Cys-210 was amplified as a thioredoxin fusion from an existing mutant plasmid for subcloning into pYEF2. The construction of YCp-MET25-COX17 and YCp-MET25-SCO2/COX17 was described previously (16Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Maximum expression with the MET25 promoter occurs in medium lacking methionine, whereas minimal expression occurs in medium containing 0.67 mm methionine (5× the normal Met level). The Sco2-Cox17 fusion contains the 5′104 residues of Sco2 containing the N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence and transmembrane domain of Sco2 fused to Cox17. YEp-MET25-COX17–1 was constructed by insertion of COX17–1 encoding the C57Y variant of Cox17 in pRS426 (26Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The correct sequences of all plasmids generated in this study were confirmed by sequencing. Protein Purification—Recombinant Cox17 was purified as described previously by Heaton et al. (14Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformants with COX17 on a pAED3 vector were used for the Cox17 purification using conventional chromatography on an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography unit (Amersham Biosciences). The C57Y mutant variant of Cox17 was purified from cells harboring the COX17–1 mutant. Recombinant Sco1 and mutant Sco1 (C148A,C152A double substitution) were purified from BL21 (DE3) transformants harboring pTNDW2 (His-tagged SCO1 or mutant SCO1) as described previously by Nittis et al. (15Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The Sco1 molecules purified were soluble truncates lacking the N-terminal 95 residues that form the mitochondrial target sequence and transmembrane domain. Nickel-NTA Superflow (Qiagen) was used for the purification of the His-tagged Sco1 proteins. ApoSco1 was isolated from E. coli transformants induced in the absence of added copper to the growth medium. Under these conditions, Sco1 is recovered with less than 0.1 mole equivalent of bound copper. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) harboring pHCDW4, a pET32a (Novagen) vector containing COX11 lacking the first 300 base pairs, was used for the purification of thioredoxin-Cox11 as a His-tagged fusion. Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column chromatography was used as described previously (11Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). ApoCox11 was isolated from bacterial transformants induced in the absence of added copper to the growth medium. Yeast transformants with YEp-GAL1-SCO1 or YEp-GAL1-COX11 were cultured in raffinose medium to an A600 nm of 0.6. Galactose was then added to induce expression of the His-tagged Sco1 or Cox11. Cells were harvested after 5 h for preparation of lysates by use of a French press and subsequent Ni-NTA purification from clarified samples. The overexpression of the soluble domain of Sco1 or Cox11 did not cause impaired mitochondrial respiration. Copper Transfer Assay—For in vitro studies, CuCox17 and mutants were purified from E. coli, concentrated, and stored anaerobically in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. ApoSco1 or apoCox11 purified from E. coli was reduced in 50 mm dithiothreitol and subsequently desalted into transfer buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl). The transfer was initiated by dilution of the Cox17 into the transfer buffer followed by the addition of the apoprotein. Emissions were monitored (with a 350-nm bandwidth filter) between 350 and 700 nm after excitation at 300 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5 and 20 nm, respectively. After analysis transfer, mixtures were separated by either affinity purification by Ni-NTA chromatography or by size exclusion on a Superdex 75 equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl. Ni-NTA chromatography was carried out by the addition of Ni-NTA resin to the protein mixture followed by a 10-min incubation at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Resin was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was designated unbound. The resin was washed once in 1 volume of transfer buffer before elution in 1 volume of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 250 mm imidazole (designated as bound). Protein content was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm with an elution buffer blank. Copper content was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Assays—The copper concentration of the protein samples was measured using a PerkinElmer (AAnalyst 100) atomic absorption spectrophotometer or a PerkinElmer Optima (3100XL) ICP spectrometer. Protein was quantified by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis in 5.7 N HCl at 110 °C in vacuo on a Beckman 6300 analyzer. Optical absorption spectroscopy was carried out on a Beckman DU640. Luminescence was measured on a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorimeter with excitation set at 300 nm. Westerns Analysis—Protein (10–50 μg) from the mitochondrial or postmitochondrial (cytosolic) fraction was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel system and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were blocked in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm Na2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), 0.01% Tween 20, and 10% milk solution prior to detection with appropriate antibodies and visualization with Pierce chemiluminescence reagents using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antisera to phosphoglycerate kinase was from Molecular Probes. Chicken anti-yeast Cox11 antisera and rabbit anti-Sco1 antisera were generated as described previously (11Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The luminescence of CuCox17 was used initially to monitor in vitro copper transfer to acceptor proteins. The emission of the copper conformer of Cox17 near 580 nm arises from thiolate-coordinated Cu(I) ions shielded from solvent quenching (14Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The target molecules tested were recombinantly expressed soluble domains of Sco1 and Cox11 lacking their transmembrane segments. We had previously shown that the soluble domain of each protein was competent for specific Cu(I) binding and that the Cu(I) conformer of each protein was nonluminescent (11Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The addition of either apoSco1 or apoCox11 to a solution of CuCox17 led to an attenuation in luminescence consistent with either quenching of the CuCox17 emission or copper ion transfer (Fig. 1A). The attenuation was complete within a 5-min assay period. Two studies suggested that the rapid loss of emission did not arise from quenching. First, the addition of the non-luminescent CuSco1 to a solution of CuCox17 did not result in any time-dependent change in emission (Fig. 1A). Second, the addition of either bovine serum albumin or carbonic anhydrase did not attenuate luminescence (data not shown). The attenuation of CuCox17 emission by the addition of apoSco1 or apoCox11 was suggestive of Cu(I) ion transfer to this protein. Copper transfer was confirmed by the purification of Sco1 or Cox11 from the incubation mixture and quantitation of bound copper. The initial His-tagged variants of Sco1 and Cox11 contained only residual copper prior to incubation with CuCox17. After incubation with CuCox17 and re-purification by Ni-NTA chromatography, both Sco1 and Cox11 were recovered with bound copper (Fig. 2A). Cox17 was not retained on the Ni-NTA column and did not stably associate with either Sco1 or Cox11. The eluates contained only Sco1 or Cox11 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the copper recovered in the eluate was associated with either Sco1 or Cox11. Residual copper in the unbound fraction was associated with Cox17. The specificity of the transfer reactions was tested in two ways. First, carbonic anhydrase was used as a nonspecific apoprotein. Binding of Cu(I) by carbonic anhydrase results in a nonfunctional enzyme that cannot be activated by exogenous Zn(II) (27Geller B.L. Winge D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Even after a prolonged incubation of CuCox17 with apocarbonic anhydrase, the enzyme was fully activated by the addition of Zn(II) to the solution, suggesting that Cu(I) ion transfer had not occurred (data not shown). Second, the C57Y mutant Cox17 encoded by the non-functional COX17–1 allele was used as a test of transfer specificity. We previously demonstrated that C57Y Cox17 binds Cu(I) normally, exists in homodimer-tetramer complexes, and when targeted to the mitochondria was still non-functional (13Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (37587): 37582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The addition of apoSco1 did not attenuate the luminescence of the C57Y Cox17 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the emission of both wild-type and C57Y Cox17 molecules was attenuated by the addition of apoCox11 (Fig. 1B). Recovery of Sco1 after incubation with C57Y Cox17 did not reveal any appreciable transferred copper, whereas recovery of Cox11 after a similar incubation with C57Y Cox17 revealed copper ion transfer (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the C57Y substitution abrogates a specific interface for Sco1. The concentration dependence of the copper transfer reactions was determined. Titrations using a fixed CuCox17 concentration and increasing the level of the apoproteins to excess conditions revealed that only a subset of the Cox17-bound Cu is transferred to Sco1 as monitored by the CuCox17 emission (Fig. 3, A and B). Even after the addition of excess apoSco1, residual Cu(I) luminescence persisted in Cox17. Only ∼40% of the Cox17-bound Cu(I) is transferred regardless of the excess of Sco1 used. The incomplete copper transfer from Cox17 arises from an inherent property within Cox17 and not Sco1. Doubling the Cox17 concentration doubles the amount of Sco1 that can be metallated. Concerning the metallation of Sco1, the nature of the titration curve suggests that copper transfer to Sco1 appears maximal near 1 mole equivalent (Fig. 3A). This observation is corroborated by recovery of Sco1, using the affinity tag, after a transfer reaction with limiting Sco1 levels. The resulting Sco1-bound copper content was near 1 mole equivalent. In a second series of titrations using excess Sco1 and varying the CuCox17 concentration, we observed a concentration dependence for copper transfer from Cox17 at limiting Cox17 levels (Fig. 3B). At concentrations below 10 μm Cox17, transfer to Sco1 appears impaired. One possibility is the known concentration dependence in Cox17 oligomerization from dimers to tetramers (KD near 20 μm) (14Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Dimeric Cox17 species may be less efficient than tetrameric species in the copper transfer reaction. Cox17 incubated in the presence and absence of apoSco1 was fractionated by gel filtration, and the distribution of Cox17 oligomers was assessed by Western analysis of the column fractions (Fig. 4A). In the absence of Sco1, Cox17 was distributed in species representing tetramers, dimers, and monomers as was shown previously (14Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). After incubation with apoSco1, less tetrameric Cox17 species were observed (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Oligomerization state of Cox17 after copper transfer.A, CuCox17 exists in multiple oligomeric states with equilibriums between tetramer-dimer (KD ∼20 μm) and dimer-monomer (KD ∼5 μm) (14Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cox17 oligomers are resolved by size exclusion (Superdex75) chromatography. CuCox17 (20 μm) fractionates into tetramers (T), dimers (D), and monomers (M). The column was calibrated with ovalbumin (43 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (24 kDa), and RNase A (13 kDa) as size standards. B, fractions corresponding to these species were recovered from chromatography of CuCox17 incubated in the presence or absence of apoSco1. Western analysis of the fractions was carried out with anti-sera to Cox17.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Similar titrations of CuCox17 to apoCox11 revealed that only a subset of the Cox17-bound Cu was also transferred to Cox11 (Fig. 3A). Approximately 55% of the Cox17-bound Cu(I) was transferred to Cox11. Mixtures of Sco1 and Cox11 did not result in greater depletion of Cox17-bound Cu(I) (data not shown). The stoichiometry of Cu(I) bound to Cox11 appeared to be 0.5 Cu(I)/monomer. Titration of Cox11 with varying CuCox17 concentrations showed more efficient copper transfer relative to Sco1 at lower Cox17 levels (Fig. 3B). Cu binding to Cox11 appears to saturate in this assay at a copper stoichiometry near 0.5 mole equivalent. This stoichiometry was confirmed by recovery of Cox11 using the affinity tag. These in vitro studies suggested that Cox17 is a specific copper donor to both Sco1 and Cox11. To further corroborate these studies, we expressed the soluble domains of each protein in a nonnative cellular compartment, the yeast cytoplasm. DNA encoding the soluble domains of SCO1 and COX11 was subcloned in a yeast episomal expression plasmid under the GAL1 promoter, permitting galactose-induced expression of each truncated gene. The soluble domains lack the mitochondrial import sequence and transmembrane domain. A His tag was added to each soluble domain to allow for affinity purification of each molecule. Galactose was added to the medium with W303 cells harboring the YEp-GAL1-SCO1 construct for 5 h prior to harvest and preparation of lysates. Fractionation of clarified lysates by"

We have developed a new variant of the yeast two-hybrid method, referred to as disruptive yeast tri-hybrid (Y3H), to identify inhibitory kinases and sites of phosphorylation in insulin receptors (IR) and IR substrates, IRS-1. Using IR and IRS-1 as bait and prey, respectively, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1) as the disruptor, we now show that phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-307, a previously identified site, is necessary but not sufficient for JNK1-mediated disruption of IR/IRS-1 binding. We further identify a new phosphorylation site, Ser-302, and show that this too is necessary for JNK1-mediated disruption. Seven additional kinases potentially linked to insulin resistance similarly block IR/IRS-1 binding in the disruptive Y3H, but through distinct Ser-302- and Ser-307-independent mechanisms. Phosphospecific antibodies that recognize sequences surrounding Ser(P)-302 or Ser(P)-307 were used to determine whether the sites were phosphorylated under relevant conditions. Phosphorylation was promoted at both sites in Fao hepatoma cells by reagents known to promote Ser/Thr phosphorylation, including the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, anisomycin, calyculin A, and insulin. The antibodies further showed that Ser(P)-302 and Ser(P)-307 are increased in animal models of obesity and insulin resistance, including genetically obese ob/ob mice, diet-induced obesity, and upon induction of hyperinsulinemia. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylation at both Ser-302 and Ser-307 is necessary for JNK1-mediated inhibition of the IR/IRS-1 interaction and that Ser-302 and Ser-307 are phosphorylated in parallel in cultured cells and in vivo under conditions that lead to insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance is the condition in which target tissues fail to respond appropriately to circulating insulin. Although genetics may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, it has become increasingly clear that acquired, non-genetic causes of insulin resistance represent a critical link between the rapidly growing national and worldwide epidemics in obesity and type 2 diabetes (1Group National Diabetes Data Diabetes in America. 2nd Ed.

Obesity and insulin resistance are also associated with and exacerbate hypertension and hyperlipidemia in addition to predisposing to the development of type 2 diabetes. This constellation of conditions, referred to collectively as either the metabolic or dysmetabolic syndrome, represents a third interrelated epidemic with a prevalence of ∼24% of adults in the United States (6Ford E.S. Giles W.H. Dietz W.H. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 356-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (5712) Google Scholar). Individuals with the metabolic syndrome have a seriously increased risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Elucidating the molecular pathways that connect obesity to pathogenesis of insulin resistance clearly has great public health importance.Of hypothesized mediators of insulin resistance, recent findings have profiled potential roles for inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines, other fat cell-derived cytokines, free fatty acids, and inhibitory serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphorylation of upstream elements of insulin signaling (7Ridker P.M.

Consistent with this, insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory salicylates reverse Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IR and IRSs in insulin-responsive tissues in obesity-, diet- and free fatty acid-induced models of insulin resistance (15Yuan M.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Many are Ser/Thr kinases involved in kinase cascades. Those mediating some of the insulin cellular actions include Raf, MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase), MAPK, p90RSK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, protein kinase B/AKT, mTOR, p70 S6 kinase, GSK3β, PKCβ1, PKCζ, and PKCλ. Overexpression of many of these kinases paradoxically inhibits insulin signaling as opposed to activating it, suggesting that the same kinases that mediate insulin signaling might also play roles in negative feedback of it (23Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In fact, IR and IRSs are themselves Ser/Thr-phosphorylated in response to insulin, providing a potential mechanism for negative feedback.Basal levels of IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation are increased in cells under various conditions, leading to observable shifts in electrophoretic mobility (15Yuan M.

In fact, IRS-1 contains 232 serines and threonines, nearly 19% of its 1231 residues, providing great potential for multisite phosphorylation. The rapid accumulation of “hyper-phosphorylated” IRS-1 upon treatment with the Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A further indicates that it is constantly being Ser/Thr-phosphorylated. Normally this is countered by phosphatases like PP2A and PP1, such that under steady-state conditions there should be a given “responsiveness” to the system. The balance might be shifted by activating Ser/Thr kinases that phosphorylate IRS or by inhibiting a relevant phosphatase. The net result in these cases would be the same; that is, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1, diminished insulin signaling, and the development of insulin resistance. Conversely, insulin signaling should be sensitized either by inhibiting the relevant Ser/Thr kinase(s) or activating the appropriate phosphatase(s).A host of Ser/Thr kinases can be shown to attenuate upstream insulin action in cultured cells, including PKA (28Stadtmauer L.

We have shown previously that Ser-307 phosphorylation blocks IR/IRS-1 binding in disruptive yeast tri-hybrid (Y3H) experiments (18Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J.

We have now used the disruptive Y3H method to identify an additional serine (Ser-302) in IRS-1 that is equally necessary for JNK-mediated disruption. We also show that Ser-302 and Ser-307 are phosphorylated in cells and in vivo under equivalent conditions of insulin resistance.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid—Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid reagents were purchased from Clontech. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (Matα trp1, his3, ura3, 6LexAop-LEU2, LYS2), transformed with p8op-lacZ (kindly provided by T. A. Gustafson, Metabolex), was used as the host for interaction studies. EGY48/p8op-lacZ was sequentially transformed with plasmid constructs using polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate according to manufacturer's protocols. To determine protein-protein interactions as a function of leucine biosynthesis (LEU2), transformants were grown on synthetic dextrose agar plates for 3 days at 30 °C. Four independent colonies were streaked on synthetic dextrose glucose agar plates, grown overnight, replica-plated on synthetic galactose/raffinose agar plates, and regrown for 5 days at 30 °C to induce expression of B42 fusion proteins.Disruptive Yeast Tri-hybrid—To create the disruptive yeast tri-hybrid assay, we modified the existing LexA yeast two-hybrid method. S. cerevisiae EGY48 cells were sequentially transformed as above with pLexA expressing human insulin receptor kinase (residues 940–1343) as bait, pB42AD expressing various human IRS-1 constructs as prey, and in most cases JNK1α1 in the third pDis plasmid. pDis was derived from the p426:Gal1 plasmid (ATCC) by replacing its multiple cloning region with another having a nuclear localization signal under Gal1 promoter control. In selected experiments alternative kinases were expressed in the pDis plasmid, including GSK3β(S9A), IKKα, IKKβ(S177E/S181E), p38 MAPK, PKA, PKCα, PKCβ2, PKCϵ, and PKCθ. Transformants were grown on the appropriate synthetic dextrose plates for 3 days at 30 °C. Four independent colonies were streaked on synthetic dextrose plates, incubated overnight, and replicaplated on GR plates. The plates were immediately replica-cleaned, incubated overnight, replica-cleaned, and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days to induce expression of pDis and B42 fusion proteins.Cell Culture—Fao hepatoma cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 25 mm glucose and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) under 5% CO2. Before experiments, Fao cells were serum-starved for 16 h in RPMI containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After treatment, cells were washed (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.0 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 5.0 μm pepstatin A, 25 mm benzamidine, 25 mm sodium vanadate, 5.0 mm glycerol phosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1.0 mm ammonium molybdate, 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EGTA) and lysed (in 30 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.0 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 5.0 μm pepstatin A, 25 mm benzamidine, 25 mm sodium vanadate, 5.0 mm glycerol phosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1.0 mm ammonium molybdate, 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 5.0 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) for immunoprecipitation and Western-blotting experiments. CHO-IR cells were maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418 and 2 mm glutamine in 5% CO2. Cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with pCMV(WT IRS-1), pCMV-(IRS-1 S307A), pCMV(IRS-1 S312A), or pCMV(IRS-1 S307A/S3012A). Cells were incubated for 24 h, serum-starved overnight, treated for 30 min with 20 μm anisomycin or 20 nm calyculin A (Bio-Mol) and for 5 min with 1 nm insulin and lysed as describe above.In Vivo Animal Studies—Fourteen week-old ob/ob (Lepob/ob) mice and congenic Lep+/+ controls were sacrificed after an overnight fast. For the “diet-induced obesity” study, 8 week-old C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratories) mice were fed a high fat diet (Research Diet D12451, 45% of calories from fat) for 8 weeks; controls were fed regular chow that derives 17% of calories from fat. After an overnight fast the 16-week-old mice were sacrificed. To determine the effects of acute, high dose insulin, chow-fed 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fasted overnight, injected intraperitoneally with 1 units/kg of insulin, and sacrificed after 10 min. Harvested livers, stored until use in liquid N2, were pulverized and homogenized with a Polytron for 30 s in lysis buffer. Cleared lysates were used for immunoprecipitations and Western blotting.Antibody Preparation and Use—Phosphospecific antibodies against IRS-1 Ser(P)-302 were generated in rabbits. Phosphopeptide RRSRTEpSITATSP (p indicates phosphorylated serine) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for use as antigen. Rabbit antisera were passed first over immobilized RRSRTESITATSP to remove antibodies that recognized the unphosphorylated sequence. Phosphospecific antibodies were affinity-isolated by passing the precleared sera over immobilized RRSRTEpSITATSP followed by a low pH elution (62Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Phosphospecific IRS-1 Ser(P)-307 antibody was either purchased from Cell Signaling or kindly provided by Morris White ("
https://openalex.org/W1987290581,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a malignant brain tumor that arises in the cerebellum of children. Activation of the Sonic hedgehog/Patched (Shh/Ptc) signaling pathway in neural progenitor cells of the cerebellum induces MBs in mice. The incomplete penetrance of tumor formation in mice, coupled with the low frequency of mutations in Shh/Ptc pathway genes in human tumors, suggests that other signaling molecules cooperate with Shh to enhance MB formation. We modeled the ability of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling to induce MB using the RCAS/tv-a system, which allows postnatal gene transfer and expression in a cell-type-specific manner. We used RCAS retroviral vectors to target expression of Shh, IGF2, and activated Akt to nestin-expressing neural progenitors in the cerebella of newborn mice. The incidence of Shh-induced tumor formation (15%) was enhanced by coexpression with IGF2 (39%) and Akt (48%). Neither IGF2 nor Akt caused tumors when expressed independently. The induced tumors showed upregulated expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 and phosphorylated forms of IGF1 receptor and Akt, mimicking activated IGF signaling found in human MBs. These results indicate that combined activation of the Shh/Ptc and IGF signaling pathways is an important mechanism in MB pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2039627657,"To evaluate the mutational profiles associated with BRAF mutations in human melanoma, we have studied BRAF, RAS, PTEN, TP53, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes and their expression in melanoma lesions. Owing to the lack of sufficient material from fresh specimens, we employed short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma biopsies. In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFΔ+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival. These data support the existence of several molecularly defined melanoma groups which likely reflect different clinical/biological behaviour, thus suggesting that a more extensive molecular classification of melanoma would significantly impact its clinical management."

Furthermore, the staggerer mice display lowered plasma apoA-I/-II, decreased plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and develop hypo-α-lipoproteinemia and atherosclerosis. However, relatively little is known about RORα in the context of target tissues, target genes, and lipid homeostasis. For example, RORα is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass peripheral tissue that accounts for ∼40% of total body weight and 50% of energy expenditure. This lean tissue is a primary site of glucose disposal and fatty acid oxidation. Consequently, muscle has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, obesity, and the blood-lipid profile. In particular, the role of RORα in skeletal muscle metabolism has not been investigated, and the contribution of skeletal muscle to the ROR–/– phenotype has not been resolved. We utilize ectopic dominant negative RORα expression in skeletal muscle cells to understand the regulatory role of RORs in this major mass peripheral tissue. Exogenous dominant negative RORα expression in skeletal muscle cells represses the endogenous levels of RORα and -γ mRNAs and ROR-dependent gene expression. Moreover, we observed attenuated expression of many genes involved in lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, we show that the muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and caveolin-3 promoters are directly regulated by ROR and coactivated by p300 and PGC-1. This study implicates RORs in the control of lipid homeostasis in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, we speculate that ROR agonists would increase fatty acid catabolism in muscle and suggest selective activators of ROR may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of obesity and atherosclerosis.

This group includes the “orphan NRs,” which have no known ligands in the “classical sense.” The orphan receptor, ROR/RZR (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor), is closely related to Rev-erbAα, RVR/Rev-erbβ/BD73, and the Drosophila orphan receptor, E75A, particularly in the DNA-binding domain and the putative ligand-binding domain. ROR, Rev-erbAα, and RVR bind as monomers to an asymmetric (A/T)6RGGTCA motif. ROR functions as a constitutive transactivator of gene expression, and in contrast, Rev-erbAα and RVR do not activate transcription, mediate transcriptional repression, and can repress constitutive trans-activation from this motif by RORα (3Adelmant G.

For example, analysis of RORα function has been assisted by a natural mutation in an obese mouse strain called staggerer (sg/sg). The mutation produces a dominant negative RORα that results in a functional knockout phenotype. In accordance with the wide expression pattern of RORα, staggerer mice show symptoms of ataxia and cerebellar dysfunction, susceptibility to atherosclerosis and hypo-α-lipoproteinemia, vascular dysfunction, muscular irregularities, osteoporosis, and severe immune abnormalities. In the context of lipid homeostasis, the staggerer mice exhibit an aberrant blood lipid profile with lower circulating plasma levels of HDL-C, apolipoprotein (apo) CIII, and plasma triglycerides. Decreases in specific lipoprotein compartments, namely apoAI, the major constituent of HDL, and apoAII, leads to a pronounced hypo-α-lipoproteinemia (16Raspe E. Duez H. Gervois P. Fievet C.

(20Jarvis C.I. Staels B. Brugg B. Lemaigre-Dubreuil Y. Tedgui A. Mariani J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 186: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggest that staggerer mice have skeletal muscle irregularities.The association between RORα, lipid homeostasis, and skeletal muscle is not surprising. RORα is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, which is one of the most metabolically demanding tissues that relies heavily on fatty acids as an energy source and accounts for 75% of glucose disposal. Moreover, this suggests that muscle has an important role in obesity, which is primarily controlled by increased food intake or decreased energy expenditure. However, the fundamental role of RORα in skeletal muscle cholesterol, lipid, glucose, and energy homeostasis has not been examined. Moreover, the contribution of skeletal muscle, a major mass tissue, to the ROR knockout phenotype has not been resolved.The involvement of RORα in the progression of atherosclerosis identifies RORα as a therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. In addition, skeletal muscle is rapidly emerging as a critical target tissue in the battle against obesity, type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, syndrome X, and atherosclerosis. NRs in skeletal muscle, for example liver X receptor (LXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α, β/δ, and γ, have been shown to be involved in enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate, decreasing triglycerides and increasing lipid catabolism, cholesterol efflux, and plasma HDL-C levels (21Tanaka T.

Hence, orphan NRs that regulate lipid and glucose metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, energy expenditure, and thermogenesis in skeletal muscle have enormous pharmacological utility for the treatment of dyslipidemia and syndrome X.We hypothesize that RORα regulates lipid, glucose, and energy homeostasis in this major mass lean tissue. This hypothesis was addressed by examining the effect of ectopically expressing the staggerer form of RORα in muscle cells and by investigating the subsequent effect on gene expression involved in lipid metabolism. Our investigation reveals that ROR has a central role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in muscle cells. Moreover, we suggest that the atherogenic and dyslipidemic phenotype of the staggerer mouse is related to aberrant RORα function in skeletal muscle.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Mouse myogenic C2C12 cells were cultured in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% Serum Supreme (BioWhittaker, Edward Keller Pty. Ltd., Hallam, Victoria, Australia)) in 6% CO2. Myoblasts were differentiated into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by 1–5 days of serum withdrawal (i.e. cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum). Cells were harvested at indicated time points, usually 120 h (5 days) after the mitogen withdrawal, unless indicated differently. African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.Transient Transfections—Each well of a 24-well plate of COS-1 cells (∼60% confluence) was transfected with a total of ∼0.6–0.8 μg of DNA per well by using the liposome-mediated transfection procedure as described previously (19Lau P. Bailey P. Dowhan D.H. Muscat G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using an N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate and Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) liposome mixture in 1× HBS (HEPES-buffered saline (42 mm HEPES, 275 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, 11 mm dextrose (pH 7.1)). The DNA/N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate/Metafectene mixture was added to the cells in 0.5–0.6 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. 16–24 h later, the culture medium was changed, and the cells were subsequently harvested for the assay of luciferase activity 24–48 h after the transfection period as described previously. Fold activation is expressed relative to LUC activity obtained after cotransfection of the reporter and pSG5 vector only, arbitrarily set at 1. The mean fold activation values and standard deviations were derived from a minimum of two independent experiments composed of six replicates. CAT assays were described previously (19Lau P. Bailey P. Dowhan D.H. Muscat G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed at least twice in sextuplicate.C2C12 Stable Transfection—Myogenic C2C12 cells, cultured in growth medium, were cotransfected with pSG5-RORΔDE (and pCMV-NEO at a 20:1 ration of expression vector/NEO vector) by the liposome-mediated procedure in duplicate. The cells were then grown for another 24 h to allow cell recovery and neomycin resistance expression before G418 selection. After 10–14 days selection with 450 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) in culture medium, the two independent polyclonal pools (>100 colonies per pool) of stable transfectants were cultured and maintained on 200 μg/ml G418 medium.RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 using TRI-Reagent (Sigma), according to manufacturer's protocol. RNA for quantitative real time (Q-RT)-PCR, was further purified by using RNeasy (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia), according to manufacturer's instructions. This was followed by DNase treatment with DNA-free (Ambion, Austin, TX.)Q-RT-PCR—RNA was normalized using UV spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 7 μg of total RNA by Superscript3, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen).

To elucidate the functional role of RORα in skeletal muscle, we initially investigated the expression of RORα mRNA relative to the 18 S rRNA in the mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line. This skeletal muscle cell line has proven to be a reliable system to study skeletal muscle lipid homeostasis in cell culture (21Tanaka T. Yamamoto J. Iwasaki S. Asaba H. Hamura H. Ikeda Y.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2477-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts can be induced to biochemically and morphologically differentiate into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal in culture over a 48–96-h period. This transition from a non-muscle phenotype to a contractile phenotype is associated with the repression of non-muscle proteins and the activation/expression of a structurally diverse group of genes responsible for contraction and to cope with the extreme metabolic demands on this organ (Fig. 1A).By using the GenBank™ sequences of RORα and -γ, we designed specific primers for the amplification of mouse ROR by quantitative real time PCR from total RNA isolated from proliferating and differentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 1A). Total poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from proliferating myoblasts (PMB), confluent myoblasts (CMB), and post-mitotic myotubes after 2 and 5 days (MT2 and MT5) of serum withdrawal and examined by real time PCR and “Northern blot” analysis.We observed that RORα and -γ are expressed in proliferating myoblasts; however, these transcripts are induced 2.5–4-fold, relative to 18 S rRNA and GAPDH mRNA (data not shown), as the cells exit the cell cycle and fuse to form differentiated multinucleated myotubes that have acquired a muscle-specific phenotype (Fig. 1, B and D). RORα is seen transcribed as a double band (Fig. 1C) in C2C12 as described in differentiated P19 cells (3Adelmant G. Begue A. Stehelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Concomitant with this increase in ROR encoding mRNAs was the striking induction of myogenin mRNA (Fig. 1E), which encodes the hierarchical bHLH regulator, and repression of the cytoskeletal non-muscle β-actin mRNA (Fig. 1F), which confirmed that these cells had terminally differentiated. Moreover, we observed the induction of the slow and fast isoforms of the contractile protein, troponin I (Fig. 1, G and H). These data demonstrated that the RORα and -γ mRNA transcripts were expressed in C2C12 cells, and expression is increased upon myotube formation.Induction of RORα and -γ mRNAs correlated with the repression of the mRNAs encoding the closely related but opposingly acting Rev-erbα and β(RVR) orphan nuclear receptors (Fig. 1, I and J), which are abundantly expressed in proliferating myogenic cells but are repressed during myogenic differentiation. This is in concordance with previous observations (50Burke L. Downes M. Carozzi A. Giguere V. Muscat G.EO. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Downes M.

This construct encodes amino acids 1–235 but lacks the entire E region and part of the hinge/D region of RORα. This was chosen because McBroom et al. (30McBroom L.D. Flock G. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 796-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that deletion of this region preserved DNA binding but destroyed trans-activation and operated in a dominant negative manner. Furthermore, the “staggerer” phenotype in mice is because of a frameshift mutation in RORα (29Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell"

Here, we show that the induction of puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis involves podocyte migration conducted by a coordinated interplay between the cysteine protease cathepsin L and α3 integrin. Puromycin aminonucleoside treatment up-regulates cathepsin L expression in podocytes in vivo as well as expression and enzymatic activity of cathepsin L in podocytes in vitro. Isolated podocytes from mice lacking cathepsin L are protected from cell puromycin aminonucleoside-induced cell detachment. The functional significance of cathepsin L expression was underscored by the observation that puromycin aminonucleoside-induced cell migration was slowed down in cathepsin L-deficient podocytes and by the preservation of cell-cell contacts and expression of vital slit diaphragm protein CD2AP. Cathepsin L expression and activity were induced in podocytes lacking α3 integrin. Similarly, acute functional inhibition of α3 integrin in wild type podocytes with a blocking antibody increased the expression of cathepsin L activity. Down-regulation of α3 integrin protected against puromycin aminonucleoside-induced podocyte detachment. In summary, these data establish that podocyte foot process effacement is a migratory event involving a novel interplay between cathepsin L and α3 integrin.

Cathepsin L is a lysosomal protease that plays an important role in the intracellular protein degradation, activation of enzyme precursors, and tumor invasion (8Honey K. Rudensky A.Y. Nat. Rev.

Normally located in lysosomes of mammalian cells, it can be secreted from the cell under certain conditions. At present, the cathepsin family contains the serine proteases (cathepsins A and G) and the aspartic proteases (cathepsins D and E). Some cathepsins also belong to cysteine proteinase, e.g. cathepsin L. All these enzymes exist in their processed form as disulfide-linked heavy and light chain subunits with molecular masses ranging from 20 to 35 kDa. Cathepsin C is the noted exception, existing as an oligomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa. Secreted forms of cathepsins are critical for degradation of the extracellular matrix during an inflammatory or adaptive response to process the environment for the new condition (10Mason R.W. Gal S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, podocytes express low levels of cathepsin L in their lysosomes (11Asanuma K. Shirato I. Ishidoh K. Kominami E. Tomino Y. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 822-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Podocyte FPs form a scaffolding around the capillary loops that are anchored to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) via α3β1 integrin (12Adler S. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar) and α-/β-dystroglycans (13Regele H.M. Fillipovic E. Langer B. Poczewki H. Kraxberger I. Bittner R.E. Kerjaschki D. J. Am. Soc.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In podocytes, α3β1 integrin is expressed at the basal side of FP. Podocytes of α3 integrin-deficient (α3-/-) mice bear a strong morphological resemblance to podocytes in congenital nephrotic syndrome and other pathologic conditions with FP effacement (15Kreidberg J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Kreidberg J.A. Donovan M.J. Goldstein S.L. Rennke H. Shepherd K. Jones R.C. Jaenisch R. Development. 1996; 122: 3537-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α3 integrin deletion therefore represents a genetic model system that allows the analysis of the molecular basis of FP assembly and dynamics. Similar to the inactivation of the α3 integrin gene, a single injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) induces reversible nephritic syndrome with podocyte FP effacement and proteinuria in rats (17Whiteside C. Prutis K. Cameron R. Thompson J. Lab. Invest. 1989; 61: 650-660PubMed Google Scholar) and mice (18Cheng Z.Z. Patari A. Aalto-Setala K. Novikov D. Schlondorff D. Holthofer H. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In vitro, puromycin leads to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, focal contacts, and SD proteins in podocytes (19Reiser J. Pixley F.J. Hug A. Kriz W. Smoyer W.E. Stanley E.R. Mundel P.

Here, we used a gene profiling approach to uncover the induction of cathepsin L mRNA and protein expression in podocytes during PAN nephrosis. We further show that the increased activity of cathepsin L is functionally significant because it is required for podocyte migration and detachment from the extracellular matrix. Finally, we establish that the activity of cathepsin L in podocytes is functionally linked to the activity of α3 integrin. Differential Display PCR of Puromycin Aminonucleoside Nephrosis— Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight, 200 g) were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of PAN (15 mg/100 g of body weight, Sigma) (21Nakamura T. Ebihara I. Shirato I. Tomino Y. Koide H. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 640-647PubMed Google Scholar). Proteinuria reached the maximum on day 8 and declined gradually thereafter as described before (22Inokuchi S. Shirato I. Kobayashi N. Koide H. Tomino Y. Sakai T. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1278-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Kidneys were harvested 8 (maximum of proteinuria) and 28 days (return of proteinuria to baseline levels) after the injection of PAN and 8 days after the injection of PBS. 10 rats were used in each group. Total RNA was prepared from homogenized glomeruli, and differential display PCR was performed exactly as described before (23Kretzler M. Fan G. Rose D. Arend L.J. Briggs J.P. Holzman L.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F770-F777PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from isolated glomeruli with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified with the Oligotex mRNA purification kit (Qiagen), separated on a 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto GeneScreen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Northern blot analyses were done with a 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe using the last 450 bp of the rat cathepsin L cDNA as template. The puromycin experiment was repeated, and glomeruli from the 8- and 28-day PAN as well as the 8-day PBS group were used. For each group, 15 μg of total RNA were used. Equal RNA loading was confirmed by hybridization with a radiolabeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-riboprobe as described before (24Mundel P. Heid H.W. Mundel T.M. Kruger M. Reiser J. Kriz W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Wild type podocytes were cultured as described (25Mundel P. Reiser J. Borja A.Z. Pavenstadt H. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). α3 integrin-deficient (α3-/-) conditionally immortalized podocyte cell lines were generated by intercrossing α3 integrin heterozygous mice (16Kreidberg J.A. Donovan M.J. Goldstein S.L. Rennke H. Shepherd K. Jones R.C. Jaenisch R. Development. 1996; 122: 3537-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the Immortomouse carrying a temperature-sensitive T-antigen as transgene (26Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Glomeruli were isolated from kidneys of E18 homozygous embryos, and eight α3-/- clonal podocyte cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution. To show that observed changes in podocyte gene expression and function were due to the absence of α3 integrin, three α3-/- clones were stably transfected with human α3 integrin cDNA as described before for α3-collecting duct epithelial cells (27Wang Z. Symons J.M. Goldstein S.L. McDonald A. Miner J.H. Kreidberg J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cultures from wild type and cathepsin L-deficient (cat L-/-) mice (28Honey K. Benlagha K. Beers C. Forbush K. Teyton L. Kleijmeer M.J. Rudensky A.Y. Bendelac A. Nat.

Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). All cell culture experiments were done in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies—The rabbit antiserum against mouse cathepsin L was used as described (29Ishidoh K. Kominami E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against mouse cathepsin L was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-CD2AP (3Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO1 antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Monoclonal anti-mouse synaptopodin antibody was used as described before (24Mundel P. Heid H.W. Mundel T.M. Kruger M. Reiser J. Kriz W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Anti-α-tubulin was purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti-human α3 integrin (P1B5) was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The functional activity of P1B5 to block ligand occupancy of the α3β1 integrin has been reported by various groups (30Melchiori A. Mortarini R. Carlone S. Marchisio P.C. Anichini A. Noonan D.M.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2321-2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. Richard O. Hynes (Boston, MA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence staining was performed on 4-μm frozen sections from rat kidney and cultured podocytes growing on collagen type I-coated glass coverslips as described previously (34Reiser J. Kriz W. Kretzler M. Mundel P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All images were analyzed by two investigators blinded to the identity of the samples. Each experiment was carried out in three independent sets. Immunoblot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out according to standard protocols and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunoblot detection kits (Amersham Biosciences) (24Mundel P. Heid H.W. Mundel T.M. Kruger M. Reiser J. Kriz W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Migration Assay—Podocyte migration was analyzed using a modified multiwell Boyden Chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc.). Bottom plates were coated with type-I collagen. For each experiment, 5 × 104 wild type and 5 × 104 cat L-/- podocytes were seeded in the Boyden chamber and allowed to migrate into the collagen coated chamber for 5–10 h while incubated at 37 °C. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated for 30 h with puromycin (50 μg/ml). Plates were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for cell counting. The average number of migrated cells was counted in four fields in five independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. Detachment Assay—Primary cultures (wild type and cat L-/-) and conditionally immortalized podocyte cell lines (wild type, α3-/-, and α3 rescue) were evaluated after PAN-induced detachment. Primary cultures were analyzed separately from cell lines. All cells were cultured on 6-cm cell culture dishes under non-permissive conditions for 14 days before analysis. Fields of cells were marked, and cell numbers per field were counted to establish a baseline number. The cells were treated with 50 μg/ml PAN, and cell numbers were counted for each field every 24 h for a total of 120 h. The average numbers of four fields in three independent sets of experiments were analyzed by student's t test. Cathepsin L Activity Measurement and Visualization—Total cathepsin L activity in cultured podocytes was determined using a modified fluorogenic assay (35Almeida P.C. Nantes I.L. Chagas J.R. Rizzi C.C. Faljoni-Alario A. Carmona E. Juliano L. Nader H.B. Tersariol I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 944-951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In brief, podocytes grown in 24-well culture plates were cultured with or without PAN overnight. To correct for differences in cell number, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to label nuclei, and cell numbers were counted using a Wallac fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After the medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 200 μl of extraction buffer (25 μg/ml digitonin, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Pefablock, pH 7.5) on ice for 10 min. Then, 500 μl of assay buffer (Hanks' buffered saline solution, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm cathepsin fluorogenic substrate) were added in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Fluorescence was recorded every 10 min for 1 h using a Wallac fluorometer with a 355-nm excitation filter and a 460-nm emission filter. Cathepsin L activity in living cells was visualizing with cresyl violet as a substrate (36Van Noorden C.J. Jonges T.G. Van Marle J. Bissell E.R. Griffini P. Jans M. Snel J. Smith R.E. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1998; 16: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Integrin Inhibition Assay—Reversible functional blocking of α3 integrin was done as described by Wei et al. (31Wei Y. Eble J.A. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Chapman H.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2975-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In brief, α3 integrin defiant podocyte rescued by human α3 integrin expression, and differentiated wild type podocytes were incubated with α3 integrin monoclonal antibody P1B5 (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, the activity of cathepsin L was analyzed in living cells using fluorophore cresyl violet as a substrate (36Van Noorden C.J. Jonges T.G. Van Marle J. Bissell E.R. Griffini P. Jans M. Snel J. Smith R.E. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1998; 16: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In control experiments, mouse monoclonal anti-synaptopodin was used. Reversible Up-regulation of Cathepsin L mRNA during PAN Nephrosis—To explore changes in glomerular gene expression during PAN nephrosis, differential display-PCR was performed using RNA from isolated rat glomeruli harvested 8 (peak of FP effacement and proteinuria) and 28 days (return to baseline) after the injection of PAN. RNA from PBS-treated rats served as a control. The banding pattern of anchored primer A and random primer 23 revealed a PCR product that was absent in the control group, up-regulated in the 8-day PAN group, and decreased in the 28-day PAN group (Fig. 1a, left panels). Since we were interested in genes associated with the onset and regression of FP effacement and proteinuria, this PCR product was further characterized. The 468-bp PCR product was identical with the 3′ end of rat cathepsin L mRNA. The differential expression of cathepsin L in PAN nephrosis was confirmed by Northern blot (Fig. 1a, right panels). When compared with PBS controls, cathepsin L was strongly up-regulated at day 8 after PAN treatment and decreased to baseline expression levels at day 28 (Fig. 1a, right panels). Cathepsin L Protein Expression Is Up-regulated in Glomerular Podocytes following PAN Injection in Vivo—To test whether the induction of cathepsin L mRNA expression was accompanied by an increased protein expression and to determine the intraglomerular distribution of cathepsin L, double labeling immunohistochemistry with the podocyte marker synaptopodin (24Mundel P. Heid H.W. Mundel T.M. Kruger M. Reiser J. Kriz W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) was performed. Cathepsin L was only weakly expressed in gloemruli of PBS-treated rats (Fig. 1b). On day 4 after PAN injection, cathepsin L expression was significantly increased in podocytes as shown by co-localization with synaptopodin (Fig. 1c). Podocyte cathepsin L staining was strongest on day 8 after PAN exposure (Fig. 1d) and decreased thereafter to near baseline expression levels at day 28 (Fig. 1e). PAN Increases Cathepsin L Expression and Activity in Cultured Podocytes—To explore the functional significance of podocyte cathepsin L expression, we analyzed the expression and activity of cathepsin L in cultured podocytes. By Western blot, a single 22-kDa band was observed in non-treated podocytes (Fig. 2a) that corresponds to the intralysosomal processed form of cathepsin L (37Ohashi K. Naruto M. Nakaki T. Sano E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After treatment with PAN for 72 h, we found a strong up-regulation of cathepsin L and the induction of the 45-kDa non-processed pro-enzyme procathepsin L (38Nishimura Y. Kawabata T. Furuno K. Kato K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Equal protein load was confirmed by reprobing the membrane with anti-α-tubulin (Fig. 2a). In controls, cathepsin L was weakly expressed in perinuclear vesicles (Fig. 2b, left panel). PAN-treated podocytes showed a strong cathepsin L staining throughout the entire cytoplasm (Fig. 2b, right panel). To test whether the up-regulation of cathepsin L protein expression was accompanied by an increased enzyme activity, we measured total cellular cathepsin L activity (35Almeida P.C. Nantes I.L. Chagas J.R. Rizzi C.C. Faljoni-Alario A. Carmona E. Juliano L. Nader H.B. Tersariol I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 944-951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cathepsin L activity in PAN-treated podocytes was significantly increased at 30 min (control, 7478 activity units; PAN, 9615 activity units; increase 28.5%, p < 0.05) and 45 min (control, 9404 activity units; PAN, 12071 activity units; increase 28.3%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2c). Next, to visualize the subcellular sites of cathepsin L activity, we used a fluorogenic substrate CV-(FR)2, which emits fluorescence light upon cleavage by cathepsin L (36Van Noorden C.J. Jonges T.G. Van Marle J. Bissell E.R. Griffini P. Jans M. Snel J. Smith R.E. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1998; 16: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In non-treated podocytes, we found a low baseline activity in lysosomes (Fig. 2d, left panel). In PAN-treated podocytes, we observed increased activity extending far into podocyte processes (Fig. 2d, right panel). The Lack of Cathepsin L Ameliorates PAN-induced Podocyte Detachment and Slows Down Cell Migration—The substantial changes in cathepsin L expression and activity after treatment of podocytes with PAN prompted us to explore how cathepsin L deficiency modulates the effects of PAN on podocytes. Therefore, we compared cell adhesion in primary podocyte cultures from wild type and cat L-/- mice (28Honey K. Benlagha K. Beers C. Forbush K. Teyton L. Kleijmeer M.J. Rudensky A.Y. Bendelac A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although there was no significant difference between PAN-treated wild type and cat L-/- podocytes at 24 h after PAN treatment, we noted a significant difference in cell adhesion after 48 h (Fig. 3a). At this time, 95% of cat L-/- podocytes were still attached when compared with 89% of wild types podocytes (p < 0.01). This difference became even more obvious at 72 h (cat L-/-, 74%, wild type, 54%; p < 0.0001). These data suggest an anti-adhesive effect of cathepsin L. Since detachment of cells requires cell movement and migration (39Friedl P. Brocker E.B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 41-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), we next analyzed the migratory response of podocytes before and after treatment with PAN. No significant differences were found in basic migration between wild type and cat L-/- podocytes (Fig. 3b), suggesting that cathepsin L is critical for the regulation of podocyte migration under normal conditions. However, after exposure to PAN for 48 h, the number of migratory wild type podocytes increased by 132% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the migration of cat L-/- podocytes was significantly slowed down by 72% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3b). Cat L-/-Podocytes Are Protected against PAN-induced Disassembly of Cell-Cell Junctions—Since cat L-/- podocytes are protected against PAN-mediated injury, we tested whether the lack of this enzyme would affect slit diaphragm protein distribution. Therefore, we analyzed cell-cell contacts of primary podocyte cultures by light microscopy and immunocytochemistry for CD2AP, a vital SD protein (3Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Wild type and cat L-/- podocytes showed well developed interdigitating cell-cell contacts with morphologic features similar to the adherens junction as described before (34Reiser J. Kriz W. Kretzler M. Mundel P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 72 h after PAN treatment, wild type podocytes revealed a loss of interdigitating cell-cell contacts and reorganization into tight junctions (Fig. 4c). In contrast, interdigitating adherens junction contacts of cat L-/- podocytes were preserved after PAN treatment (Fig. 4e). In untreated wild type and cat L-/- podocytes, CD2AP was found at interdigitating cell-cell contacts (Fig. 4, e and f). After PAN treatment, CD2AP labeling was strongly reduced in wild type podocyte (Fig. 4g). In contrast, the expression and localization of CD2AP were preserved in cat L-/- podocytes (Fig. 4h). Regulation of Cathepsin L Activity by α3Integrin—Podocytes of α3-/- mice are unable to maintain normal podocyte structure, including the elaboration of mature foot processes along the GBM (16Kreidberg J.A. Donovan M.J. Goldstein S.L. Rennke H. Shepherd K. Jones R.C. Jaenisch R. Development. 1996; 122: 3537-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, α3-/- mice provide a genetic model to study podocyte FP effacement. To test whether changes in the expression of cathepsin L in podocytes are restricted to the PAN model or whether cathepsin L is induced in other models of FP effacement, we analyzed cathepsin L in podocytes derived from α3-/- mice. In α3-/- podocytes, cathepsin L protein expression was strongly induced (Fig. 5a, left panel). Similarly to PAN-treated wild type podocytes (Fig. 2a), an additional 45-kDa band corresponding to procathepsin L was also observed in α3-/- podocytes (Fig. 5a, left panel). In α3-/- cells rescued by stable transfection of human α3 integrin, the expression of procathepsin L and cathepsin L was normalized, and only a faint 21-kDa band representing the intralysosomal form of cathepsin L could be detected (Fig. 5a, right panel). Immunofluorescence labeling of cathepsin L in α3-/- podocytes revealed a strong staining throughout the entire cytoplasm (Fig. 5b, left panel). In contrast, cathepsin L was restricted to perinuclear lysosomes in podocytes rescued with α3 integrin (Fig. 5b, right panel), a pattern similar to that observed in untreated wild type cells (Fig. 2b, left panel). Furthermore, cathepsin L activity was increased and extended far into the periphery of cell processes (Fig. 5c, left panel). In rescued podocytes, the activity of cathepsin L was localized in perinuclear lysosomes (Fig. 5c, right panel), similar to untreated wild type podocytes (Fig. 2d, left panel). These results suggest that the expression, activity, and subcellular localization of cathepsin L in podocytes are negatively regulated by α3 integrin. To further explore the functional relationship between cathepsin L and α3 integrin, we inhibited the extracellular domain of α3 integrin with an α3 integrin-specific blocking antibody (31Wei Y. Eble J.A. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Chapman H.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2975-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) for 1 h and examined the effect of this inhibition on cathepsin L activity. Blockade of α3 integrin shifted cathepsin L activity from its perinuclear localization into podocyte processes (Fig. 5f). As a positive control for the functional blockade of α3 integrin, we administered P1B5 antibody to cultured podocytes rescued with human α3 integrin. Similar to the blocking experiments for cultured wild type podocytes, cathepsin L activity was redistributed into the processes of the rescued cells within 1 h (data not shown). Thus, in addition to human α3 integrin, the PB15 can also block the activity of murine α3 integrin. A negative control antibody did not alter the perinuclear localization of cathepsin L activity (Fig. 5g). These data suggest that regulation of cell adhesion via α3 integrin is functionally linked to cathepsin L, which in turn is necessary for PAN-induced cell migration. Down-regulation of α3Integrin Protects against PAN-induced Podocyte Detachment—Podocytes derived from α3-/- mice express high levels of (pro-)cathepsin L and cathepsin L, similar to wild type podocytes after PAN treatment, and the acute functional inhibition of α3 integrin results in the shift of cathepsin L activity. Therefore, we tested whether the PAN-induced increase of cathepsin L in wild type podocytes is followed by changes in the expression of α3 integrin. The Western blot analysis of PAN-treated wild type podocytes showed a marked down-regulation of α3 integrin expression when compared with non-treated control cells 48 h after PAN treatment (Fig. 6a). To explore the functional consequences of down-regulated α3 integrin in the course of PAN treatment, we used the rescued α3-/- podocyte cells. that constitutively express human α3 integrin at their focal contacts (Fig. 6b, middle) in amounts comparable with wild type cells (Fig. 6b, left panel). In the rescued cells, the expression of α3 integrin is under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter and not altered by PAN treatment (Fig. 6b, right panel). Therefore, this constitutively active system of α3 integrin expression is well suited to study the effects of PAN treatment on podocyte attachment with or without the ability to down-regulate α3 integrin. Rescued podocytes constitutively expressing α3 integrin underwent severe detachment as early as 24 h after the initiation of PAN treatment when compared with 98% of wild type and α3-/- cells (Fig. 6d). 48 h after PAN treatment, 50% of rescued cells remained attached when compared with 93% of wild type (p < 0.001) and 88% of α3-/- podocytes (p < 0.001). 72 h after PAN exposure, 50% of wild type and α3-/- cells remained attached, whereas more than 90% of the constitutively α3 integrin-expressing cells were detached (p < 0.001). These results demonstrate that down-regulation of α3 integrin is a protective response to podocyte injury. This study describes that the induction of nephrotic syndrome involves podocyte migration orchestrated by a coordinated interplay between cathepsin L and α3 integrin. In particular, we established that (i) the increased expression and activity of cathepsin L are associated with the onset of proteinuria; (ii) the increased migration of podocytes after PAN treatment is abrogated in cat L-/- podocytes, and cat L-/- podocytes are protected against PAN-induced disassembly of cell-cell junctions; (iii) the subcellular localization of cathepsin L activity is regulated by α3 integrin expression and function; and (iv) the down-regulation of α3 integrin expression protects against PAN-induced podocyte detachment. The identification of cathepsin L as a mediator of podocyte migration is interesting in two aspects. First, it provides a novel concept that FP effacement of podocytes is a migratory event and second, it shows that cell motility in a non-malignant cell may depend on a matrix-modifying enzyme. Cathepsin L was not necessary to maintain a basic migration in podocytes under normal conditions since no differences in migration were observed between wild type and cathepsin L-/- podocytes. However, cathepsin L was necessary for an augmented migratory response to PAN treatment. Clearly, future studies will be necessary to test whether the changes in migratory behavior are solely due to the lack of cathepsin L or whether the deletion of cathepsin L also affects the function of other proteins. Cathepsin L may not only alter size- and charge-selective properties of the filtration barrier but may modify extracellular moieties to engage a subset of integrins or dystroglycans on podocyte FP to allow FP to spread on the GBM, thereby establishing FP effacement. These movements require disassembly of podocyte cell-cell contacts, an event that by itself may cause or augment proteinuria. Our results in podocytes establish similarities with tumor metastasis in which cathepsin L is involved in tissue invasion and disease progression (40Levicar N. Dewey R.A. Daley E. Bates T.E. Davies D. Kos J. Pilkington G.J. Lah T.T. Cancer Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The functional significance of cathepsin L in podocyte pathobiology is underscored by the finding that cat L-/- podocytes are protected from cell detachment and cell-cell junction disassembly. These data also provide a molecular explanation for the previous observation that a specific cathepsin L inhibitor significantly reduces anti-GBM antibody-induced proteinuria (41Baricos W.H. Cortez S.L. Le Q.C. Wu L.T. Shaw E. Hanada K. Shah S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another major finding of the present study is the observation that the subcellular distribution of cathepsin L depends on the expression and activity of α3 integrin. The functional blockade of α3 integrin resulted in an immediate, reversible redistribution of cathepsin L activity into the periphery of podocyte processes. This shift may initiate the response of podocytes to alter the extracellular matrix composition by enzymatic cleavage of extracellular components to change cell adhesion and motility. Another explanation would be that cathepsin L cleaves or degrades intracellular α3 integrin, thereby leading to the elimination of α3 integrin in focal contacts. In fact, intracellular cleaving activity of cathepsins has been described before (42Authier F. Mort J.S. Bell A.W. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15798-15807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and more experiments are necessary to test whether this is the case for α3 integrin as well. Cultured podocytes secrete cathepsin L in response to various growth factors (11Asanuma K. Shirato I. Ishidoh K. Kominami E. Tomino Y. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 822-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and cytokines (43Van Den Berg J.G. Aten J. Chand M.A. Claessen N. Dijkink L. Wijdenes J. Lakkis F.G. Weening J.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 413-422PubMed Google Scholar), which are also found in various human glomerular diseases with FP effacement and proteinuria including minimal change disease. Here, we found increased cathepsin L expression and activity in podocytes of α3-/- mice. Up to now, it is widely believed that α3 integrin represents a major adhesion receptor in podocytes. The results of this study, however, demonstrate that podocytes do not need α3 integrin to adhere to the extracellular/GBM. Rather, the down-regulation of α3 integrin results in prolonged adhesion and protects against podocyte detachment. Our data suggest that α3β1 in podocytes has a modulatory role in cell adhesion similar to the role of α3β1 integrin as a trans-dominant inhibitor of other integrins in keratinocytes (44Hodivala-Dilke K.M. DiPersio C.M. Kreidberg J.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In summary, our results suggest a molecular interplay of cathepsin L and α3 integrin in the pathogenesis of podocyte FP effacement and proteinuria. Based on these results, we propose that podocyte FP effacement is a migratory event triggered by podocyte injury such as PAN or others, leading to the activation of cathepsin L (Fig. 7). This injurious stimulus activates stationary podocytes to migrate along the GBM, leading to FP effacement. This movement requires cathepsin L-dependent rearrangement of cell-cell contacts and disassembly of the slit diaphragm. Proteinuria occurs and α3 integrin is down-regulated to increase podocyte attachment to the GBM in the effaced stage. Although the injury lasts, podocytes can recover, or if recovery fails, detachment and progression of glomerular disease continue. We thank Alexander Y. Rudensky for the cathepsin knock-out mice, Andrey S. Shaw for the CD2AP antibody, and Richard O. Hynes for the rabbit polyclonal anti α3-integrin.

The intestinal brush border membrane of the canine hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, contains aspartic proteases (APR-1), cysteine proteases (CP-2), and metalloproteases (MEP-1), the first of which is known to digest Hb. We now show that Hb is degraded by a multi-enzyme, synergistic cascade of proteolysis. Recombinant APR-1 and CP-2, but not MEP-1, digested native Hb and denatured globin. MEP-1, however, did cleave globin fragments that had undergone prior digestion by APR-1 and CP-2. Proteolytic cleavage sites within the Hb α and β chains were determined for the three enzymes, identifying a total of 131 cleavage sites. By scanning synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries with each enzyme, we compared the preferred residues cleaved in the libraries with the known cleavage sites within Hb. The semi-ordered pathway of Hb digestion described here is surprisingly similar to that used by Plasmodium to digest Hb and provides a potential mechanism by which these hemoglobinases are efficacious vaccines in animal models of hookworm infection.

The semi-ordered pathway of Hb digestion described here is surprisingly similar to that used by Plasmodium to digest Hb and provides a potential mechanism by which these hemoglobinases are efficacious vaccines in animal models of hookworm infection. In mammals, gastric digestion of proteins derived from food involves a cascade of mechanistically distinct proteases. One of the major food sources of blood-feeding parasites, hemoglobin (Hb), is presumed to be degraded in a similar manner by a cascade of proteases that cleave the intact Hb tetramer into successively smaller fragments that are used to provide nutrients for anabolic processes such as maturation and reproduction. To date, the only hematophagous parasite in which such a proteolytic cascade of Hb digestion has been identified is the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, where a semi-ordered catalytic pathway exists including members of at least three different mechanistic classes of endoproteases. Hb is degraded in the P. falciparum digestive vacuole initially by aspartic proteases termed plasmepsins (1Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R.

Cerami A. Henderson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). P. falciparum also expresses vacuolar cysteine proteases, termed falcipains, which are able to digest native Hb and denatured globin (4Salas F. Fichmann J. Lee G.K. Scott M.D. Rosenthal P.J. Infect.

After initial digestion with plasmepsins and falcipains, a P. falciparum metalloprotease, falcilysin, digests globin fragments even further (7Eggleson K.K. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Hematophagous helminths include representatives from diverse phyla including nematodes and platyhelminths. Their life cycles are complex, and so to ensure transmission in the face of environmental adversity, helminths release vast quantities of fertilized eggs, a physiologic process that necessitates a protein-rich diet, such as blood. This is evident in the increased consumption of blood by female schistosomes (8Lawrence J.D. J. Parasitol. 1973; 59: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the overexpression of mRNAs encoding hemoglobinolytic proteases in female schistosomes (9Hu W. Yan Q. Shen D.K. Liu F.

Aspartic and cysteine proteases are present in the gut lumen and surrounding gastrodermis of blood-feeding adult schistosomes, and although an ordered pathway of Hb degradation is assumed, it has yet to be characterized in any detail (10Brindley P.J.

Hookworms are blood-feeding nematodes that reside in the small intestine of infected mammalian hosts (12Hotez P.J. Brooker S. Bethony J.M. Bottazzi M.E. Loukas A. Xiao S.H. New Eng. J. Med. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). An estimated 740 million people are infected with the human hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and/or Necator americanus (13de Silva N.R. Brooker S. Hotez P.J. Montresor A. Engels D. Savioli L. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 547-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Many hookworm-infected people, particularly women and children, develop subclinical or clinical hookworm disease, including anemia and impaired physical and cognitive development, as a direct result of blood loss at the site of attachment in the intestine (12Hotez P.J. Brooker S. Bethony J.M. Bottazzi M.E. Loukas A. Xiao S.H. New Eng. J. Med. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The impact of this blood loss in chronically infected populations is enormous. For example, in a single village of ∼800 people in South China, it was estimated that hookworms caused an annual blood loss of 200 liters (14Hotez P.J. China Q. 2002; 172: 1029-1041Crossref Google Scholar). To obtain an unimpeded blood meal, hookworms secrete potent anticoagulants, the actions of which have been well characterized (15Cappello M.

Once blood is ingested by adult hookworms, they lyse erythrocytes using a pore-forming, membrane-bound hemolysin (17Don T.A. Jones M.K. Smyth D. O'Donoghue P. Hotez P.J. Loukas A. Int. J.

The pH of the hookworm intestine is not definitively known; however, it is presumed to be acidic in nature (18Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Knox D.P. Hotez P.J. Loukas A.

Until now, only the aspartic proteases, APR-1 and APR-2, had been shown to digest Hb in vitro (19Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Abbenante G. Prociv P. Berry C. Girdwood K. Pritchard D.I. Fairlie D.P.

Moreover, these hookworm proteases were more efficient at digesting Hb from permissive host species than from nonpermissive hosts, despite sharing identical active sites residues; this highlights the exquisite co-evolution of these enzymes with host substrates (19Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Abbenante G. Prociv P. Berry C. Girdwood K. Pritchard D.I. Fairlie D.P. Hotez P.J. Zhan B. Loukas A. J. Infect.

Parasitology. 2003; 126: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have suggested that hookworms likely employ a cascade of hemoglobinolysis utilizing multiple proteases of distinct mechanistic classes (18Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Knox D.P. Hotez P.J. Loukas A. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 417-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A cathepsin B-like cysteine protease, Ac-CP-2 (24Harrop S.A. Sawangjaroen N. Prociv P. Brindley P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), was recently shown to be expressed in the intestinal brush border of adult Ancylostoma caninum hookworms, and immunization of dogs with the recombinant protease resulted in an anti-fecundity effect on female hookworms (21Loukas A. Bethony J. Williamson A. Goud G. Mendez S. Zhan B. Hawdon J.M. Bottazzi M.E. Brindley P.J. Hotez P. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 1952-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, a neprilysin-like metalloendopeptidase was identified from the intestinal brush border of adult A. caninum (25Jones B.F. Hotez P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); however, the recombinant molecule was not expressed in catalytically active form, precluding the determination of a functional role for this enzyme. Here we show that the canine hookworm digests Hb in a semi-ordered cascade that consists of at least aspartic, cysteine, and metalloproteases, which act in synergy at acidic pH. The classes of proteases involved and the order of their actions are strikingly similar to those used by P. falciparum to digest Hb in the food vacuole.

To express MEP-1 in baculovirus, the entire open reading frame minus the predicted signal peptide was amplified by PCR using a MEP-1 pBluescript plasmid as the template. The 5′ PCR primer incorporated a SacI restriction site and was designed so that the recombinant protein was fused in-frame with the honey bee melittin signal peptide encoded by pMelBac (Invitrogen). The 3′ primer incorporated an NcoI restriction site preceded by nucleotides encoding a hexa-His tag and stop codon. Amplicons were ligated into pMelBac by restriction cloning, and plasmids were generated by heat shock transformation of TOP 10 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Plasmid preparation, sequencing, and protein expression were performed as described for APR-1 (20Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Abbenante G. Prociv P. Berry C. Girdwood K. Pritchard D.I. Fairlie D.P.

Purification of Recombinant Ac-MEP-1—Supernatant from 500 ml of Ac-MEP-1 baculovirus culture was concentrated to 100 ml using a 10-kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane (Pall Scientific), and the buffer was exchanged into 2 liters of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, plus 100 mm CaCl2 (gelatin binding buffer) and concentrated to a final volume of 100 ml. The concentrated supernatant was bound to gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated in gelatin binding buffer. Binding occurred overnight on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. The MEP-1 supernatant/gelatin-Sepharose mix was applied to a column and allowed to settle. The column was then washed with 100 ml of gelatin binding buffer, and Ac-MEP-1 was eluted in 15 × 1.0-ml fractions of 2% Me2SO in H2O (elution buffer). Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Fractions containing recombinant proteins were pooled and concentrated, and buffer was exchanged into gelatin binding buffer.

Recombinant Ac-CP-2 cleaved the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin with an optimal pH range of 5.0–7.0 as described previously (21Loukas A. Bethony J. Williamson A. Goud G.

Optimal assay conditions for Ac-MEP-1 were determined using pre-cast gelatin gels (Invitrogen) and the Novex® zymogram gels developing system per the manufacturer's guidelines (Invitrogen). To determine the optimal pH for proteolytic activity, zymogram gels were cut into strips and incubated in developing buffer (Invitrogen; containing 10 mm CaCl2 or ZnCl2) overnight at single pH value increments from pH 1.0 to 8.0 in the presence/absence of 10 μm 1,10-phenanthroline. Gelatin gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to observe clear zones of hydrolysis. Immunohistochemistry—Adult A. caninum were prepared for immunostaining as described previously (19Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Abbenante G. Prociv P. Berry C. Girdwood K. Pritchard D.I. Fairlie D.P.

Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h. Dog antisera were produced against each protease formulated with the adjuvant AS03 as described for CP-2 (21Loukas A. Bethony J. Williamson A. Goud G. Mendez S. Zhan B. Hawdon J.M. Bottazzi M.E.

Antisera (diluted 1:100, 1:500, 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline) were applied to each tissue section and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber. Subsequent steps were as described elsewhere (19Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Abbenante G. Prociv P. Berry C. Girdwood K. Pritchard D.I. Fairlie D.P. Hotez P.J. Zhan B. Loukas A. J. Infect.

Determination of Subsite Preferences Using Positional Scanning Synthetic Combinatorial Libraries—The P1-P4 specificities of recombinant Ac-CP-2 were investigated using a combinatorial fluorogenic peptide library established by the Proteomics group at the University of California, San Francisco, as described previously (28Harris J.L.

Briefly, aliquots of 25 nm (in the appropriate activity buffer for each protease) from the 20 respective residues of each of the P1–P4 sub-libraries were added to wells (8000 compounds of diversity/well) of a 96-well Microfluor-1 U-bottom plate (Dynex Technologies). The assay was performed in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35, and 1% Me2SO (from the substrates). Assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme and monitored fluorimetrically with a SpectraMax Gemini fluorescence spectrometer (Molecular Devices) with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. All assays were performed in triplicate. Aspartic and metalloproteases usually exert their specificities at the prime side of the cleavage site; to determine the P1′–P4′ subsite preferences for APR-1 and MEP-1, peptide library analysis was carried out as described previously (29Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The substrate peptide library acetyl-XXX-amide contains an equimolar mixture of the 19 naturally occurring amino acids, excluding cysteine, at each position. The peptide mixture (1 mm) was digested with Ac-MEP-1 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 or with Ac-APR-1 in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0, to ∼5% completion. Digests (10 μl) were subjected to N-terminal sequencing on a Procise 494 automated Edman sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The molar proportion of each amino acid residue at a given position was determined by dividing the amount of each residue present in the corresponding sequencing cycle by the amount present in the starting mixture. Proteolysis of Hb by Ac-APR-1, Ac-CP-2, and Ac-MEP-1—Whole dog Hb was prepared by lysis of red blood cells as described previously (20Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Abbenante G. Prociv P. Berry C. Girdwood K. Pritchard D.I. Fairlie D.P. Hotez P.J. Dalton J.P. Loukas A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1458-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One hundred micrograms of Hb was incubated for 5, 10, and 15 min with various combinations of 1.0 μg each of Ac-APR-1, Ac-CP-2, and Ac-MEP-1 ± inhibitors (1.0 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm E-64, 10 μm 1,10-phenanthroline, respectively) in 0.1 m Na2HPO3, pH 6.0 activity buffer (total volume 250 μl). Twenty-five microliters of each sample was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under native conditions (20Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Abbenante G. Prociv P. Berry C. Girdwood K. Pritchard D.I. Fairlie D.P. Hotez P.J. Dalton J.P. Loukas A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1458-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hemoglobinolysis was also monitored at 410 nm using a spectrophotometer and reversed phase (RP)-HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: RP, reversed phase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; MS-MS, tandem mass spectroscopy; LC, liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. RP-HPLC, MALDI-TOF, and MS-MS Analysis of Hb Hydrolysates—Hb that had been incubated for 15 min with various combinations of hookworm proteases in the presence/absence of specific protease inhibitors were subjected to RP-HPLC analysis, and the respective masses of Hb-derived peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF. Briefly, aliquots of 50 μl from each hydrolysate were separated by RP-HPLC using a Vydac C18 TP54 150 × 4.6-mm column (Bodman) and a linear gradient of water/acetonitrile (both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) from 15 to 65% for 50 min. The HPLC separation was monitored by a UV detector set at 215 nm. Fractions were collected automatically every minute and analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Axima CFR plus, Kratos) either in linear or reflectron mode, using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic as MALDI matrix. Aliquots of 20 μl from each sample were also analyzed by LC-MS. The instrumental set up consisted of an HPLC (HP 1100, Agilent) connected to an electrospray-ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Thermofinnigan). Chromatographic conditions for the HPLC-MS analyses were as follows: flow rate of 50 μl/min, obtained with a microflow processor (Acurate, LC Packing) set to a split ratio 1:10, Vydac 238MS 1 × 250-mm column, mobile phases were water (A) or 100% acetonitrile (B) both containing 0.01% heptafluorobutyric acid and 1% acetic acid. The separation was carried out at 10% B for the first 5 min followed by a linear gradient from 10 to 50% B for 40 min. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed either in full scan mode or in data-dependent mode (MS-MS). The latter analytical approach was used to perform the selective fragmentation of the ionic species that in any given scan (from 300 to 2000 atomic mass units) yielded the highest peak intensity, allowing both molecular mass and structural information to be obtained for chromatographically separated peptides. MS-MS data were then analyzed using TurboSequest 2.0 software (30Eng J. MacCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5386) Google Scholar) (ThermoFinnigan). Aspartic, Cysteine, and Metalloproteases Localize to the Intestinal Microvilli of Adult Hookworms—We previously localized APR-1 (20Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Abbenante G. Prociv P. Berry C. Girdwood K. Pritchard D.I. Fairlie D.P. Hotez P.J. Dalton J.P. Loukas A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1458-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), CP-2 (21Loukas A. Bethony J. Williamson A. Goud G.

Parasitol. 2002; 119: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to transverse sections of adult A. caninum hookworms. Here we confirm that each protease bound to the intestine only of longitudinal sections of adult hookworms (Fig. 1), whereas control serum did not bind to any structures. Both male and female worms were probed, with no significant differences in localization observed between the two sexes (not shown). Expression and Substrate Affinity Purification of Catalytically Active MEP-1—Ac-MEP-1 was expressed by baculovirus in High 5 cells and secreted into culture medium at a yield of 4 mg·liter-1. The protease was successfully purified to homogeneity (as determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels) using gelatin-Sepharose (Fig. 2A) but did not bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (not shown) despite the presence of a hexa-His tag confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-hexa-His monoclonal antibody (not shown). The purified protein migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa (Fig. 2A). Ac-MEP-1 Is Enzymatically Active and Degrades Gelatin— Ac-MEP-1 readily degraded gelatin (with as little as 1.0 ng of recombinant enzyme), and activity was completely inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 2B). Activity was detected at a broad range of pH values; the most intense zones of hydrolysis were seen at pH 2.0 and again at pH 5.0–7.0 (not shown). Interestingly, gelatinolytic activity was not detected at pH 3.0 and only weakly at pH 4.0. Gelatinolytic activity was detected at similar levels using both 10 mm CaCl2 and ZnCl2 (not shown). Subsite Specificities of Hookworm Proteases Using Synthetic Combinatorial Libraries—Aspartic and metalloproteases normally exert their specificities C-terminally to the scissile bond, suggesting that P1–P4 fixed positional libraries would not be suitable for subsite determinations. Papain-like cysteine proteases, however, are most selective N-terminal to the cleavage site, notably at the P2 position (31Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The P1–P4 specificities of CP-2 were determined, revealing a preference for basic residues at P1, notably Lys, and a fairly unusual preference for Pro at P2 (Fig. 3). Papain-like enzymes usually prefer bulky, hydrophobic amino acids in this position (31Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cysteine proteases are typically less selective at P3 and P4; and CP-2 preferred Thr and Arg at P3 and displayed less specificity at P4 but prominently cleaved acidic residues. The prime side specificities of APR-1 and MEP-1 were assessed (29Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) using a peptide library technique to analyze the substrate pool selected by the proteases from a completely random mixture of peptide dodecamers (Fig. 3). For APR-1, hydrophobic residues were well tolerated at P1′, with the major selections being for Phe, Tyr, Ile and Met, and Ala and Ser. Other P1′ residues were deselected. There were also subtle preferences for hydrophobic residues at P2′ with Val being the most favored amino acid. No significant selectivity was seen beyond P2′. MEP-1 was most selective at the P1′ position, where it excluded charged residues as well as Pro and Trp. Although the protease tolerated a wide spectru"
https://openalex.org/W2002871502,"Glucose and glucosamine (GlcN) cause insulin resistance over several hours by increasing metabolite flux through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). To elucidate the early events underlying glucose-induced desensitization, we treated isolated adipocytes with either glucose or GlcN and then measured intracellular levels of glucose-6-P (G-6-P), GlcN-6-P, UDP-Glc-NAc, and ATP. Glucose treatment rapidly increased G-6-P levels (t½ < 1 min), which plateaued by 15 min and remained elevated for up to 4 h (glucose ED50 = 4mm). In glucose-treated cells, GlcN-6-P was undetectable; however, GlcN treatment (2 mm) caused a rapid and massive accumulation of GlcN-6-P. Levels increased by 5 min (∼400 nmol/g) and continued to rise over 2 h (t½ ∼ 20 min) before reaching a plateau at >1,400 nmol/g (ED50 = 900 μm). Thus, at high GlcN concentrations, unrestricted flux into the HBP greatly exceeds the biosynthetic capacity of the pathway leading to a rapid buildup of GlcN-6-P. The GlcN-induced rise in GlcN-6-P levels was correlated with ATP depletion, suggesting that ATP loss is caused by phosphate sequestration (with the formation of GlcN-6-P) or the energy demands of phosphorylation. As expected, GlcN and glucose increased UDP-GlcNAc levels (t½ ∼ 14–18 min), but greater levels were obtained with GlcN (4–5-fold for GlcN, 2-fold for glucose). Importantly, we found that low doses of GlcN (<250 μm, ED50 = 80 μm) could markedly elevate UDP-GlcNAc levels without increasing GlcN-6-P levels or depleting ATP levels. These studies on the dynamic actions of glucose and GlcN on hexosamine levels should be useful in exploring the functional role of the HBP and in avoiding the potential pitfalls in the pharmacological use of GlcN.

The distinguishing hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus is an inability of insulin to elicit a normal biological response in peripheral, insulin-responsive target tissues (a condition known as insulin resistance). To investigate the detrimental role of hyperglycemia under defined in vitro conditions, we developed a method to maintain isolated adipocytes in primary culture (1Marshall S. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 2Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Geller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6376-6384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we used this system to examine the induction of insulin resistance (3Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Marshall S. Diabetes. 1985; 35: 258-267Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol.

In 1991, we reported (6Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the discovery of a unique metabolic pathway mediating glucose-induced desensitization of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system (GTS). 1The abbreviations used are: GTS, glucose transport system; HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; HBSS, Hepes-buffered balanced saline solution; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: GTS, glucose transport system; HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; HBSS, Hepes-buffered balanced saline solution; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. Because a major function of this pathway is the formation of hexosamine metabolites, we postulated that enhanced flux of incoming glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) culminates in the induction of insulin resistance (6Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have now confirmed the hexosamine hypothesis and extended the regulatory actions of the HBP to muscle tissue and other cell types (7McClain D.A. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 9: 186-191Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8McClain D.A. Crook E.D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rosetti L.

Diabetes. 2002; 9: 160-167Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Enhanced flux into the HBP begins with glucose uptake and the rapid phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P). G-6-P can then be routed to the glycogen biosynthesis pathway, shunted to the pentose phosphate pathway, or converted to fructose 6-phosphate and subsequently catabolized through the glycolytic pathway. Although these pathways represent the major routes traversed by the vast majority of glucose, a small percentage of incoming glucose can be enzymatically converted to glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) by glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP (10Marshall S. Rumberger J. Walker M. Butler P. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Annual/13. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2000: 97-112Google Scholar). Once formed, GlcN-6-P undergoes a series of rapid conversions to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Several studies now indicate that the generation of UDP-GlcNAc plays an important role in the induction of insulin resistance by serving as the precursor product for O-linked glycosylation of various cytosolic and nuclear proteins (7McClain D.A. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 9: 186-191Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 10Marshall S. Rumberger J. Walker M. Butler P. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Annual/13.

(U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).In adipocytes, GlcN is 40 times more potent than glucose in mediating desensitization (6Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As such, GlcN can be a useful tool for studying hexosamine-mediated desensitization because it directly enters the HBP at the level of GlcN-6-P. However, such a potent pharmacological compound can have cellular actions that are distinct from glucose (11Marshall S. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2002; 9: 160-167Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the current study, we have examined the temporal and dose-dependent actions of glucose and GlcN on the formation of hexosamine products. These studies were designed with two goals in mind: to elucidate the early events in glucose-induced desensitization (formation of hexosamine products) and to better understand the pharmacological actions of GlcN.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sources of materials were as follows: Porcine insulin, Sigma; collagenase, Worthington; bovine serum albumin, Armour; and penicillin-streptomycin, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium formulated without d-glucose, Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY. All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise specified.Preparation and Treatment of Isolated Adipocytes—Isolated adipocytes were obtained from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–225 g) by collagenase digestion as described previously (2Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Geller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6376-6384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After digestion, cells were washed three times in Hepes-buffered balanced saline solution (HBSS) consisting of 25 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6. Cells were then diluted to a final concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml (12 ml of HBSS per 1 g of initial fat weight). From a common pool of cells, 400 μl of adipocytes were aliquoted into 17 × 100 mm of sterile polystyrene tubes containing 1.6 ml of HBSS. Unless otherwise indicated, insulin was added (25 ng/ml final concentration), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C to stimulate the GTS and facilitate the subsequent uptake of glucose or GlcN. After 20 min, glucose, GlcN (or both) was added, and adipocytes were further incubated at 37 °C for either 4 h (dose-response experiments) or for various times (time course experiments).Measurement of UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine Levels—After treatment, adipocytes were transferred to 1.5-ml microfuge tubes, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold, bovine serum albumin-free HBSS. During the final wash, the cell volume was reduced to 150 μl, and 0.4 ml of cold perchloric acid (0.3 mol/liter) was added to adipocytes for 10 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 20,800 × g (10 min at 4 °C), and the deproteinated metabolite extract (420 μl) was transferred to a new microfuge tube. After the extract was neutralized by adding a small amount of K2CO3 (5 m), extracts were frozen and stored at –20 °C. The concentration of UDP-GlcNAc was measured by HPLC as described previously (14Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Liu R. Hu M.Z. Chen W. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2173-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) by first passing the cell extract through a strong anion-exchange Supelclean LC-SAX column (Supelco, Bellefornte, PA). Analysis was performed using an HPLC system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) and two reverse phase LC18T columns in series (Supelco). Metabolite concentration was quantitated by UV absorption (260 nm), and levels were determined from a standard calibration curve. Recovery of standards added to adipocyte extract was >95%.Measurement of ATP and G-6-P Levels—ATP concentrations were determined using a standard two-step, coupled reaction developed by Passonneau and Lowry (15Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. The Humana Press, Totowa, N. J.1993: 122-123Google Scholar, 16Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972: 123-124Google Scholar). In this method, glucose and hexokinase are added to the adipocyte extract to generate ADP and G-6-P. In the second step, G-6-P is converted to NADPH and 6-phosphogluconolactone (by G-6-P dehydrogenase). The assay was performed in 96-well plates to which we added 150 μl of buffer containing 200 mm triethanolamine-HCl, 10 μm NADP, 5 mm MgCl, plus 150 μl of sample. The relative fluorescence unit was then measured before and 5 min after the addition 10 μl of 44 units/ml G-6-P dehydrogenase. Measurements were obtained using a Beckman spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and a 460-nm emission wavelength. Changes in relative fluorescence units were converted to a concentration by use of a calibration curve generated by assaying 0–24 μl of 25 μm G-6-P. Duplicate measurements were obtained for each sample and averaged. Levels of G-6-P were similarly measured fluorometrically (17Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar) using G-6-P standard calibration curves.Measurement of GlcN-6-P Levels—We have developed a fluorometric assay to measure GlcN-6-P levels based on the same enzymatic principles used to measure G-6-P levels. At high concentrations, we found that G-6-P dehydrogenase can act on GlcN-6-P and NADP, resulting in equimolar production of NADPH, whereas at low concentrations (used to measure G-6-P) NADPH was not generated. Thus, the low affinity of G-6-P dehydrogenase for GlcN-6-P allows for the resolution of G-6-P from GlcN-6-P in the same sample by first carrying out the assay for G-6-P with a low amount of G-6-P dehydrogenase (1.2 units/ml) followed by the addition of a much greater concentration of G-6-P dehydrogenase (43 units/ml). Optimization of assay methods revealed that GlcN-6-P measurements are not affected by glucose, GlcN, G-6-P, or GlcNAc-6-P and that standard calibration curves (using GlcN-6-P) are linear (data not shown). To further validate assay results, we incubated adipocytes for 4 h with various concentrations of GlcN, prepared metabolite extracts as described above, and then measured GlcN-6-P levels using two methods. The first method was the fluorometric assay. The second assay method entailed derivatization of GlcN-6-P with o-phthaldialdehyde so that it can be detected fluorometrically (following separation by reverse phase HPLC). Both assay methods yielded similar results, but the fluorometric enzymatic assay was faster, less expensive, and allowed for the measurement of numerous samples (using a 96-well assay format).Assessment of Glucosamine-induced Desensitization of the Insulin-responsive GTS—Isolated adipocytes (400 μl) were added to HBSS (1.6 ml) in 17 × 100-mm sterile polystyrene tubes and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h in the absence (controls) or presence of various concentrations of GlcN. After 5h, cells were washed three times with GlcN-free HBSS containing 25 ng/ml insulin. During the final wash, cells were resuspended in HBSS buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, and concentrated to about 2 × 105 cells/ml. Maximal insulin-stimulated rates of glucose transport were determined by incubating adipocytes with 25 ng/ml insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. Initial rates of glucose uptake were measured by adding 20 μl of HBSS containing 0.12 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose and 2-deoxyglucose (final substrate concentration of 50 μm). At the end of 3 min, the reaction was terminated by separating cells (180-μl aliquots) from buffer by centrifugation through silicone oil. To correct the 2-deoxyglucose uptake values for uptake by simple diffusion and for nonspecific trapping of radioactivity in the cell pellet, we assessed glucose uptake in the presence of 0.3 mm phloretin. Glucose uptake was derived from the mean of duplicate determinations sampled in duplicate.Competitive Effects of Glucose on 14C-Labeled GlcN Uptake—Isolated adipocytes (0.2 ml of cells in 12 × 75-mm polystyrene tubes) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 25 ng/ml insulin and various concentrations of glucose. Initial rates of GlcN uptake were measured by adding 20 μl of HBSS containing 0.1 μCi of 14C-labeled GlcN. At the end of 3 min, the reaction was terminated by separating cells (170-μl aliquots) from the buffer by centrifugation through silicone oil. To correct uptake values for simple diffusion and for nonspecific trapping of radioactivity in the cell pellet, we assessed GlcN in the presence of 0.3 mm phloretin, which blocks uptake through the glucose transport system.RESULTSEffects of Glucose on G-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc Levels—As shown in the inset of Fig. 1A, the addition of 20 mm glucose to insulin-treated cells rapidly elevated intracellular G-6-P levels (t½ < 1 min). By 15 min, equilibrium was established, and levels remained elevated for up to 4 h (Fig. 1A). A dose-response curve obtained after 4 h of treatment yielded a glucose ED50 of 4 mm (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows that the rapid rise in G-6-P levels was followed by a slower increase in UDP-GlcNAc (t½ = 18 min). At 1 h, UDP-GlcNAc reached a plateau about 2-fold higher than basal values and remained at this level for up to 4 h. When UDP-GlcNAc levels were assessed after a 4-h treatment time using various concentrations of glucose, we obtained an ED50 value of 1.2 mm (Fig. 1D). It is important to mention that GlcN-6-P was undetectable in glucose-treated cells (data not shown). These data indicate that extracellular glucose is transported into adipocytes through the insulin-responsive GTS and rapidly phosphorylated to G-6-P. Once internalized, a portion of incoming glucose is routed to the HBP resulting in the subsequent rise in UDP-GlcNAc levels. Flux through the HBP must be relatively rapid because formation of UDP-GlcNAc could be seen as early as 5 min after the addition of glucose (Fig. 1C). The slower rise in UDP-GlcNAc over the 1st h can be explained by rate-limiting steps in UDP-GlcNAc utilization (i.e. protein glycosylation) or a slow conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to other metabolites.Effects of Glucosamine on GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc Levels—After uptake into cells, GlcN is rapidly phosphorylated and enters the HBP at the level of GlcN-6-P. To assess the rapidity and magnitude of metabolite formation, we examined the ability of GlcN to elevate two key hexosamine metabolites, GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc. Time course studies in insulin-treated cells revealed that 2 mm GlcN causes a rapid and massive accumulation of GlcN-6-P (Fig. 2A). GlcN-6-P levels increased by 5 min (∼400 nmol/g) and continued to rise over 2 h (t½ ∼ 20 min), reaching a plateau at >1,400 nmol/g. Dose-response studies (Fig. 2B) showed that GlcN-6-P levels were unchanged when cells were incubated for 4 h with GlcN concentrations <250 μm. At 500 μm GlcN, levels were only slightly elevated, whereas GlcN-6-P levels were maximally elevated at 2 mm GlcN (ED50 = 0.9 mm). In the absence of insulin, similar results were obtained, but a 10-fold higher concentration of GlcN was required (ED50 = 8 mm).Fig. 2Ability of glucosamine to elevate intracellular levels of GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc. Adipocytes were treated for 20 min with 25 ng/ml insulin and then incubated with 2 mm GlcN for the indicated times (A and C) or incubated for 4 h with the indicated concentrations of GlcN (B and D). At the end of the treatment time, cells were lysed with perchloric acid, and the neutralized cell extract was deproteinated. Concentrations of GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean of duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 2, C and D depict the effects of GlcN on UDP-GlcNAc levels as a function of treatment time and dose. When UDP-GlcNAc levels were assessed over time (Fig. 2C), we found that 2mm GlcN rapidly increased UDP-GlcNAc during the 1st h (t½ ∼ 14 min). Levels remained elevated for up to 4 h. Dose-response studies (at 4 h) revealed an interesting biphasic effect of GlcN treatment (Fig. 2D). Low doses of GlcN (up to 500 μm) increased UDP-GlcNAc levels by 4–5-fold (ED50 of 80 μm), whereas higher GlcN doses (0.75–10 mm) progressively diminished maximal levels of UDP-GlcNAc. By comparing the GlcN-induced rise in GlcN-6-P levels (Fig. 2B) with the dose-dependent increase in UDP-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 2D), it is apparent that low concentrations of GlcN can markedly elevate UDP-GlcNAc levels without altering GlcN-6-P levels. From this finding, we conclude that low concentrations of GlcN are rapidly taken up by adipocytes, phosphorylated to GlcN-6-P, and then routed through the HBP resulting in a 4–5-fold increase in UDP-GlcNAc levels. At higher levels of extracellular GlcN (>250 μm), we believe that uptake and intracellular phosphorylation of GlcN exceeds the capacity of the HBP, which leads to a progressive accumulation of GlcN-6-P.Changes in Intracellular Hexosamine Metabolites after Removal of Extracellular Glucosamine—To gain additional insights into the kinetics of hexosamine flux, we pretreated adipocytes for 1 h with 2 mm GlcN and then washed cells to remove extracellular GlcN. As shown in Fig. 3A, we found that intracellular GlcN-6-P levels were reduced from 1500 nmol/g to about 300 nmol/g after 1 h (t½ = 17 min). In contrast, UDP-GlcNAc levels actually increased during this time (Fig. 3B). Thus, it appears that the high intracellular levels of GlcN-6-P are reduced by the continued flux of GlcN-6-P through the HBP. Using a similar experimental protocol in which cells were exposed to 20 mm glucose and then extensively washed to remove extracellular glucose, we found that G-6-P levels were also rapidly reduced (t½ = 15 min) upon the removal of extracellular glucose uptake (data not shown).Fig. 3Temporal changes in GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc levels after removal of glucosamine. Adipocytes were treated for 20 min with 25 ng/ml insulin and then incubated for 1 h with 2 mm GlcN. Cells were then washed four times and incubated in GlcN-free buffer for the indicated times (Wash-Out Time). Concentrations of GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean of duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Depletion of Cellular ATP by High Concentrations of Glucosamine—GlcN has been reported to reduce ATP levels in 3T3-L1 cells (18Hresko R.C. Heimberg H. Chi M.M.Y. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20658-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of GlcN on ATP levels in adipocytes, we performed the dose-response experiment depicted in Fig. 4A. As can be seen, little or no depletion of ATP was observed at low GlcN concentrations (up to 250 μm). However, ATP levels were markedly reduced at higher concentrations (1–4 mm). Because GlcN concentrations that result in ATP loss (Fig. 4A) closely correlated with GlcN concentrations that lead to accumulation of GlcN-6-P (Fig. 2B), we postulate that phosphate depletion (resulting from excessive formation of GlcN-6-P) or the energy demands associated with massive phosphorylation lower cellular ATP levels. This idea is supported by the time course data depicted in Fig. 4B. The rapid decease in ATP levels upon exposure to 2 mm GlcN (t½ = 8 min) temporally corresponds to the rapid accumulation of GlcN-6-P that is observable by 5 min (Fig. 2A). It is interesting to note that ATP depletion also correlates with the decrease in UDP-GlcNAc levels seen at higher GlcN concentrations (Fig. 2D). One possible explanation is that ATP depletion (caused by excessive phosphorylation of GlcN) adversely affects one or more biosynthetic steps within the HBP.Fig. 4Effects of glucosamine on ATP levels and induction of insulin resistance.A, adipocytes were treated for 20 min with 25 ng/ml insulin and then incubated for 4 h with the indicated concentrations of GlcN. B, cells were treated for 20 min with 25 ng/ml insulin and then incubated for the indicated times with 2 mm GlcN. Concentrations of ATP were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean of duplicate determinations. C, adipocytes were incubated for 5 h with 25 ng/ml insulin and the indicated concentrations of GlcN. At the end of the incubation period, cells were thoroughly washed and insulin-stimulated rates of glucose uptake were measured using 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of three replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Glucosamine-induced Desensitization of the Insulin-responsive GTS and Corresponding Changes in Hexosamine Metabolites and ATP Levels—As shown in Fig. 4C, treatment of isolated adipocytes for 5 h with various concentrations of GlcN led to progressive desensitization of the GTS. Substantial insulin resistance was observed using 200 μm GlcN, and near maximal desensitization was obtained using 500 μm GlcN. At these doses, there was little or no reduction in ATP levels (Fig. 4A), and there were minimal changes in GlcN-6-P levels (Fig. 2B). It is important to note that the development of desensitization best correlated with the glucosamine-induced increase in UDP-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 2D). This is consistent with the hypothesis that desensitization through the HBP is mediated by enhanced levels of UDP-GlcNAc and the resulting O-linked glycosylation of key regulatory proteins.Ability of Glucosamine to Elevate Hexosamine Metabolites under Euglycemic Conditions (Presence of 5 mmGlucose)—Fig. 5 depicts the effect of 5 mm glucose on GlcN-mediated increases in the intracellular levels of GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc. From the two dose-response curves shown in Fig. 5, B and C, we conclude that higher doses of GlcN are required to increase GlcN-6-P in the presence of glucose (as compared with treatment with GlcN alone). In other words, there was a rightward shift in the GlcN dose-response curve from an ED50 of 0.9 mm (Fig. 2B, GlcN alone) to an ED50 of 2.3 mm (Fig. 5B). We also found that co-treatment with glucose reduced the maximal amount of GlcN-6-P that accumulated in the presence high levels of GlcN. With GlcN alone GlcN-6-P levels rose to about 1500 nmol/g (Fig. 2A), whereas levels rose to about 600 nmol/g in the presence of glucose and GlcN (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Combined effect of glucose and glucosamine on GlcN-6-P, UDP-GlcNAc, and ATP levels.A–E, adipocytes were treated for 20 min with 25 ng/ml insulin and then incubated with 2 mm GlcN and 5 mm glucose for the indicated times (time courses) or incubated for 4 h with 5 mm glucose plus the indicated concentrations of GlcN (dose responses). Each point represents the mean of duplicate determinations. F, isolated adipocytes were pretreated for 20 min at 37 °C with 25 ng/ml insulin and then incubated for 20 min with the indicated concentrations of glucose. Glucosamine uptake was then assessed by adding [14C]glucosamine for 3 min and then measuring cell-associated radioactivity. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The dose-response study shown in Fig. 5D shows that GlcN (in the presence of 5 mm glucose) increased UDP-GlcNAc levels with an ED50 of 170 μm. Again, this represents a rightward shift in the GlcN dose-response curve compared with cells similarly treated in the absence of glucose (Fig. 2D). The rightward shift is most likely caused by reduced uptake of GlcN in the presence of glucose because glucose has a higher affinity for cell-surface glucose transporters and can competitively inhibit GlcN uptake. Although glucose was able to reduce the steady-state levels of GlcN-6-P by half (Fig. 5B), no such reduction was observed when measuring UDP-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 5D). In fact, the combination of glucose and GlcN increased UDP-GlcNAc levels by about 30% above those obtained with maximally effective concentrations of GlcN alone (compare Fig. 2D with Fig. 5D). When the dose-response curves in Fig. 5, B and D, are compared, it can be clearly seen that that increases in UDP-GlcNAc levels occur before any measurable changes in GlcN-6-P levels. Specifically, 750 μm of GlcN failed to elevate GlcN-6-P, whereas this dose almost maximally increased UDP-GlcNAc levels. This again illustrates that above a certain threshold concentration of GlcN, the ability of the HBP to process incoming substrate becomes increasingly rate-limited resulting in progressive accumulation of GlcN-6-P.Time course studies, measuring formation of GlcN-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc during a 3-h incubation period with 5 mm glucose and 20 mm GlcN (Fig. 5, A and C), indicated that the kinetics of hexosamine formation were unaffected by the inclusion of glucose. This conclusion is based on the finding of similar t½ values for GlcN-mediated accumulation of GlcN-6-P in the absence (t½ of 20 min, Fig. 2A) and presence of glucose (t½ of 18 min, Fig. 5A). For UDP-GlcNAc measurements, a t½ of 14 min was obtained with GlcN alone (Fig. 2C) compared with a t½ of 20 min with glucose and GlcNAc treatment.The results depicted in Fig. 5E reveal that 2 mm GlcN (plus 5 mm glucose) failed to diminish ATP levels during a 4-h incubation.

Increased MK staining and mRNA expression were observed in the lungs of hypoxia-susceptible CAST/eiJ mice during hypoxia. MK expression was induced by hypoxia in cell lines in vitro. Because the transcription factor hypoxiainducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) modulates cellular responses to hypoxia, we tested whether increased expression of MK in the lung was mediated by HIF-1α. HIF-1α enhanced the transcription of MK, acting on HIF-1α regulatory elements located in the MK gene promoter.

In the mouse, MK was detected as early as embryonic day (E) 10 in the primordial lung buds (9Kurtz A. Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1995; 6: 151-177PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenous MK enhanced growth of the pulmonary mesenchyme during branching morphogenesis of embryonic lung in vitro (10Toriyama K. Muramatsu H. Hoshino T. Torii S. Muramatsu T. Differentiation. 1996; 61: 161-167Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The temporal-spatial expression of MK in the developing lung and its regulation by a lung-specific homeobox containing transcription factor, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), were recently demonstrated (8Reynolds P.R. Mucenski M.L. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the biological functions of MK are not fully understood, MK protein and splice variants of MK mRNA have been detected in several carcinomas (9Kurtz A. Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1995; 6: 151-177PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garver R.I. Chan C.S. Milner P.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These data suggest that MK may play a role in tumorigenesis, perhaps mediated by its effects on angiogenesis. In the mouse lung MK is expressed in a bimodal manner, with high levels of expression observed at E13-16.5 and postnatal days (PN) 5-12 (8Reynolds P.R. Mucenski M.L. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Elevated MK expression in the postnatal period was coincident with alveolarization and pulmonary vascular development and remodeling. MK mRNA and protein expression are absent in the mouse lung after the alveolar stage of lung development (PN15). Because of its precise pattern of expression and its potential role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, we hypothesized that MK may play a role in the formation and differentiation of the pulmonary vascular bed. The pulmonary vasculature is highly responsive to changes in ambient oxygen. Chronic hypoxia initially induces vasoconstriction followed by increased muscularization of the vasculature associated with pulmonary hypertension (12Thomas B.J. Wanstall J.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 477: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The effects of hypoxia have been recently surveyed in several strains of mice. CAST/eiJ is an inbred strain of mice in which chronic hypoxia caused increased muscularization of small pulmonary arteries. CAST/eiJ mice develop right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension, whereas FVB/N mice were unresponsive to chronic hypoxia. 2W. Nichols, unpublished observations. Cellular responses to hypoxia are mediated in part by the regulator of cellular and systemic oxygen homeostasis, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (13Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar,14Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is an αβ-heterodimeric protein that was initially identified as a DNA binding factor that mediates hypoxia-inducible activity of the erythropoietin 3′ enhancer (13Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Although HIF-1β is constitutively expressed, HIF-1α is rapidly induced by hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is regulated by hydroxylation, subsequent ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation (15Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). During hypoxia HIF-1β binds HIF-1α, prohibiting proteasomal degradation, and the complex is transported to the nucleus, where it binds HIF response elements (HREs, 5′-RCGTG-3′). The binding of HIF-1α/HIF-1β to HREs assists in the recruitment of coactivator molecules that form transcription initiation complexes to enhance the expression of genes that mediate cellular and physiologic responses to hypoxia (16Semenza G.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, mediated by autocrine-paracrine signals, play a critical role in directing morphogenesis by providing signals that induce genetic programs in pulmonary cells (17Costa R.H. Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L823-L838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The process of alveolarization occurs primarily during the postnatal period and is completed by 3-4 weeks of age in the mouse. During this period alveoli are increasingly septated, and alveolar walls thin to generate an efficient gas exchange compartment. Also required in this process is the formation of the pulmonary vasculature. Muscularization of pulmonary arterioles develops late in gestation and is mediated by autocrine-paracrine signaling, which directs smooth muscle cell-specific gene expression (18Veyssier-Belot C. Cacoub P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle differentiation is directed by a serum response factor (SRF) coactivator, myocardin (19Wang Z. Wang D.-Z. Pipes G.C.T. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7129-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), which forms protein-DNA complexes consisting of dimerized SRF bound to CArG box sequences (20Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are known to be critical to lung morphogenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which epithelial and mesenchymal cells communicate during lung formation or a response to hypoxia remain poorly understood. In the present study we demonstrate that MK expression was induced by HIF-1α during hypoxia. Furthermore, increased expression of MK in the respiratory epithelium increased the expression of myocardin, smooth muscle cell markers and increased the muscularization of small pulmonary arteries. These data provide a mechanism by which hypoxia influences gene expression in the respiratory epithelium to generate midkine, a paracrine signal, that influences the formation of the pulmonary vasculature. Mouse Models and Animal Husbandry—CAST/eiJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in a temperature-controlled room (22-25 °C) under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Animal husbandry followed protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation. Human surfactant protein C (SP-C) is selectively expressed in endodermally derived epithelial cells in the embryonic lung and is expressed in subsets of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells after birth (21Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The SP-C-rtTA+/tg transgene was generated by inserting 3.7 kilobases of the human SP-C promoter upstream of the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) gene (22Tichelaar J.W. Lu W. Whitsett J.A.

The (tetO)7-CMV-MK+/tg or -tg/tg transgene was generated by inserting a 696-bp mouse MK cDNA downstream of a minimal CMV promoter containing seven concatamerized tetracycline receptor binding sites. Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection using standard techniques, and genotypes were determined by PCR. (tetO)7-CMV-MK+/tg or -tg/tg mice were identified by amplification of a 559-bp sequence of the transgene by using the following primers: forward (5′-GCC ATC CAC GCT GTT TTG AC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGT CTT TGA CTT GGT CTT GGA GG-3′). PCR parameters included heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. SP-C-rtTA+/tg mice were identified by PCR amplification as previously described (23Mucenski M.L. Wert S.E. Nation J.M. Loudy D.E. Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Morrisey E.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol.

Double transgenic mice (SP-C-rtTA+/tg, (tetO)7-CMV-MK+/tg or -tg/tg) were created by crossing the SP-C-rtTA+/tg transgenic mice with (tetO)7-CMV-MK+/tg or -tg/tg transgenic mice. MK expression was induced by feeding animals doxycycline-containing food (625 mg/kg, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). Transgenic and control mice were housed as described above. MK transgene expression was verified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in three separate transgenic lines. The experiments described here utilize mice from a single founder line that expressed MK under control of doxycycline. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical staining for MK was performed as previously described (8Reynolds P.R. Mucenski M.L. Whitsett J.A. Dev.

Immunohistochemical staining for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (1:20,000, Sigma) and caldesmon (1:500, Sigma) were performed using 5-μm paraffin sections. Sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min. Staining was performed following the manufacturer's instructions using a “Mouse on Mouse” (M.O.M.) monoclonal antibody kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and sections were development in 3,3-diamino-benzidine reagent (Sigma).

Cells were routinely cultured in 5% CO2, 95% air (normoxic conditions) at 37 °C. At 80-90% confluence, cells were split and plated in 35-mm dishes and allowed to grow in normoxia for 18 h. Cells were placed into an incubator in which FiO2 was regulated (Thermo Forma Series II Water Jacketed CO2 Incubator, model 3100, Marietta, OH). Cells were exposed to a mixture of 5% O2, 90% N2, and 5% CO2 for 4 h. Following the manufacturer's instructions, cells were rapidly lysed, and total RNA was isolated using the Absolutely RNA® RT-PCR Miniprep kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In Vitro Addition of MK Protein—MFLM-4 cells were maintained as outlined above. At 80-90% confluence, cells were split and plated in 35-mm dishes. After 6 h, 10 μg/ml recombinant human MK (rhMK 258-MD, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% fetal calf serum was added. Cells were lysed, and RNA was isolated as outlined previously after 24 h in culture. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from wild type and double transgenic lung using Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) and from cells grown in culture by using the Absolutely RNA® RT-PCR Miniprep Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturers' instructions. 2-μg aliquots of total RNA were treated with 1 μl each of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) and DNase I (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 15 m. The DNase I was heat-denatured at 90 °C for 10 min, and reverse transcription was performed with SuperScript™II-RT (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using 2-μl aliquots of the generated cDNA using Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science).

MK was amplified by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. HIF-1α was amplified by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 m. Both were followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. All other primer pairs were utilized as outlined (25Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol.

Quantitative fluorogenic amplification of cDNA was performed in the Smart Cycler® processing block, model SC1000-1 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and by using the LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). The relative abundance of mRNA was determined from standard curves generated from the amplification from serially diluted standard pools of cDNA and normalized to β-actin mRNA. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The entire 2.5-kilobase (p2.5MK-luc) and a 5′-truncated 1.7-kilobase (p1.7MK-luc) mouse MK promoter was directionally cloned into the pGL3-basic reporter plasmid (Promega) and verified by sequencing as previously described (8Reynolds P.R. Mucenski M.L. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the two putative HREs in the p2.5MK-luc reporter construct was performed by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Synthetic oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation (RCGTG → CTTGC) were extended during a PCR reaction to generate promoters that contained a mutant 5′ HRE, p2.5MK(Δ5′HRE)-luc, and a mutant 3′ HRE, p2.5MK(Δ3′HRE)-luc. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Functional assays of reporter gene constructs were performed in triplicate using transient transfection of JEG-3 as previously outlined (8Reynolds P.R. Mucenski M.L. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plasmid concentrations included 500 ng/μl pRSV-βGAL, 100 ng/μl p2.5MK-luc or p1.7MK-luc, 80-480 ng/μl pCMV-HIF-1α, and pCDNA control vector to bring the total amount of DNA in each transfection to 1.08 μg. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (29Bohinski R.J. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Reporter assays were normalized for transfection efficiency based on the β-galactosidase activity. Morphometric Analysis—Mice were killed as previously described (23Mucenski M.L. Wert S.E.

At the time of necropsy, hearts were removed and dissected. The right ventricle (RV) was separated from the left ventricle and septum (LV+S) and weighed on an analytical balance. Ratios of RV weight/LV+S weight and RV weight/body weight are represented. Lungs were inflation fixed, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in a series of alcohols, and embedded in paraffin (30Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F.

To assess muscularization of the peripheral pulmonary vessels, lung sections were immunohistochemically stained with an α-SMA monoclonal antibody as described above. In each randomized 60× field, vessels (15-50-μm external diameter) were classified as fully muscularized (actin staining >75% of the circumference), partially muscularized (actin staining 25-50% of the circumference), or non-muscularized (actin staining <25% of the circumference) as previously described (31Zaidi S.H. You X.M. Ciura S. Husain M. Rabinovitch M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The percentage of peripheral pulmonary blood vessels that were fully or partially muscularized was calculated, and t tests were performed to demonstrate significant differences between double transgenic and non-transgenic littermates at the p ≤ 0.05 level. In Vivo Exposure to Hypoxia—Double transgenic and non-transgenic mice were placed in a normobaric chamber and exposed to FiO2 of 0.10 for 5 weeks. Normobaric hypoxia was achieved by displacement with N2 regulated by a Pro-Ox Model 110 unit (Biospherix, Ltd., Redfield, NY). The chamber was changed regularly with activated carbon (Fisher), Drierite (Hammond Drierite Co, Ltd., Xenia, OH), and Baralyme® (Allied Healthcare Products, Inc., St. Louis, MO) to prevent the toxic accumulation of ammonia, excess humidity, and carbon dioxide. Once a week, mice were exposed to room air for less than 20 min to obtain body weights, clean cages, and/or replenish food and water. Pulmonary Arteriograms, Histology, and Arterial Density Counts—Adult mice were sacrificed with a sodium pentobarbital (26%) euthanasia solution (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA), and lungs were infused with a heated solution of gelatin and barium through the pulmonary artery as previously described (32Le Cras T.D. Hardie W.D. Fagan K. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1046-L1054PubMed Google Scholar). Pulmonary arterial architecture was imaged by x-ray radiography. The left lungs were subsequently embedded in paraffin and sectioned as previously described. To determine arterial density, barium-filled pulmonary arteries were counted by a blinded observer in randomly selected high-powered (60×) fields of distal lung. Fields containing large airways and/or large vessels were excluded. All vessels were counted, and five high-powered fields were counted per animal. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed with the following primary antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Tie-2 diluted 1:2000 and a goat polyclonal antibody to platelet endothelial cellular adhesion molecule diluted 1:2000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Lung homogenates (25 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dried milk. Immunodetection was performed by incubating the membranes with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz) was diluted in blocking buffer (1:10,000) and applied for 60 min. After three washes, ECL Plus detection (Amersham Biosciences) was performed, and auto-radiographs were taken. Increased MK Expression during Hypoxia in Vivo and in Vitro—CAST/eiJ mice, an inbred strain, develop vascular remodeling and cor pulmonale during hypoxia (FiO2 of 0.10), whereas FVB/N mice are resistant to hypoxia. MK was not induced in the lungs of adult FVB/N mice during hypoxia (Fig. 1, A and B). Although MK was barely detectable in the lungs of adult CAST/eiJ mice housed in normoxic conditions, intense staining of MK was observed in alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature of adult CAST/eiJ mice exposed to hypoxia (FiO2 of 0.10) for 4 weeks (Fig. 1, C and D). MK staining was observed in the peripheral pulmonary epithelium and smooth muscle of the pulmonary vasculature (Fig. 1, E and F). Intensity of staining with MK increased during exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 1, G and L). MK staining was induced in the epithelial cells lining proximal bronchioles after 1 week in hypoxia (Fig. 1, G and I). When hypoxic exposure was lengthened to 2 weeks MK staining was observed in the alveolar regions of the lung parenchyma (Fig. 1J). After exposure to hypoxia for 3 and 4 weeks MK staining was observed throughout the lung and was detected in epithelial cells of the conducting and peripheral airways and in the smooth muscle cells of the peripheral pulmonary blood vessels (Fig. 1, K and L). MK mRNA was detected in the lungs of CAST/eiJ mice after hypoxic exposure for 1 week, and expression steadily increased as the hypoxic exposure lengthened to 4 weeks (Fig. 2). Increasing MK expression was associated with increased immunostaining for α-SMA (Fig. 1F) and increased α-SMA mRNA (not shown). Thus, hypoxia induced MK expression in the lungs of hypoxemia-susceptible CAST/eiJ mice.Fig. 2MK mRNA expression in CAST/eiJ mice during hypoxia. CAST/eiJ mice were exposed to hypoxia (FiO2 of 0.10) for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks, and whole lung RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. MK mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, and relative expression levels were compared with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of hypoxia on MK expression was assessed in various cell lines including human placental adenocarcinoma (JEG-3), mouse fetal lung mesenchyme (MFLM-4), and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma (H-441). HIF-1α and MK mRNA expression were increased by hypoxia in all of the cell lines tested (Fig. 3). HIF-1α Regulates MK Transcription in Vitro—Because HIF-1α is a known transcriptional mediator of response to hypoxia, effects of HIF-1α on MK transcription were assessed. JEG-3 cells were co-transfected with a luciferase-reporter plasmid containing 2.5 kilobases of the 5′-region of the mouse MK gene (p2.5MK-luc) and an expression vector containing HIF-1α cDNA. HIF-1α activated the MK promoter (Fig. 4) and acted in an additive manner when co-transfected with TTF-1 (Fig. 4B). There are two potential HREs in the 2.5MK-luc plasmid, located at -1701 to -1697 (5′-HRE) and +48 to +52 (3′-HRE). Deletion of the 5′-HRE in the promoter (p1.7MK-luc) did not inhibit HIF-1α responses (Fig. 4C). To identify HREs that mediate HIF-1α-induced MK transcription, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the HREs located at -1701 to -1697 and +48 to +52, generating p2.5MK(Δ5′HRE)-luc and p2.5MK(Δ3′HRE)-luc, respectively (Fig. 4D). Mutation of the 5′-HRE did not significantly inhibit transactivation by HIF-1α. In contrast, HIF-1α did not induce MK transcription when the 3′-HRE was mutated (Fig. 4D), demonstrating that the proximal HRE regulates HIF-1α-induced expression of MK. Inducible Expression of MK in the Murine Lung—To assess the effects of chronic MK expression during lung morphogenesis, mouse MK was expressed in the respiratory epithelium of transgenic mice using the human surfactant protein C promoter (21Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The human surfactant protein C promoter mediates respiratory epithelial cell-specific expression of the rtTA, which binds doxycycline and induces MK expression from tet-O binding sites that activate a minimal CMV promoter (Fig. 5A).

There is evidence for a large intracellular pool of EAAC1 from which transporter is redistributed to the cell surface following activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor by seemingly independent pathways. A variety of biotinylation strategies were employed to measure trafficking of EAAC1 to and from the plasma membrane and to examine the effects of phorbol ester and PDGF on these events. Biotinylation of cell surface protein under trafficking-permissive conditions (37 °C) resulted in a 2-fold increase in the amount of biotinylated EAAC1 within 15 min in C6 glioma and in primary neuronal cultures, suggesting that EAAC1 has a half-life of ∼5–7 min for residence at the plasma membrane. Both phorbol ester and PDGF increased the amount of transporter labeled under these conditions. Using a reversible biotinylation strategy, a similarly rapid internalization of EAAC1 was observed in C6 glioma. Phorbol ester, but not PDGF, blocked this measure of internalization. Incubation at 18 °C, which blocks some forms of intracellular membrane trafficking, inhibited PKC- and PDGF-dependent redistribution of EAAC1 but had no effect on basal trafficking of EAAC1. These studies suggest that both PKC and PDGF accelerate delivery of EAAC1 to the cell surface and that PKC has an additional effect on endocytosis. The data also suggest that basal and regulated pools of EAAC1 exist in distinct compartments.

A family of Na+-dependent transporters both ensures appropriate excitatory signaling and limits the excitotoxic potential of glutamate in the mammalian central nervous system. This family includes members that are generally expressed in astrocytes (GLT-1 and GLAST) or neurons (EAAC1 and EAAT4) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Amara S.G. Sonders M.S. Zahniser N.R. Povlock S.L.

EAAC1 is enriched on the post-synaptic processes of pyramidal cells in cortex and hippocampus, two pathways that display remarkable synaptic plasticity and exquisite sensitivity to excitotoxic insults (4Rothstein J.D.

EAAC1 is also found on inhibitory interneurons (8Conti F. DiBiasi S. Minelli A. Rothstein J.D. Melone M. Cerebral Cortex. 1998; 8: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) where it appears to provide precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (9Mathews G.C.

Antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of EAAC1 disrupts γ-aminobutyric acid synthesis and causes an epilepsy-like phenotype (10Sepkuty J.P. Cohen A.S. Eccles C. Rafiq A. Behar K. Ganel R. Coulter D.A.

In addition to these physiologic roles, there is evidence that EAAC1 expression is altered under various pathologic conditions (11Crino P.B. Jin H. Shumate M.D. Robinson M.B. Coulter D.A.

The activities of the GLUT4 subtype of glucose transporter and of several neurotransmitter transporters can be rapidly altered by changing the number of transporters present at the plasma membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 15Bryant N.J.

In both C6 glioma and primary neuronal cultures, less than 30% of total EAAC1 is found on the cell surface, with the remainder on intracellular vesicles of unknown identity (19Sims K.D. Straff D.J.

Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This effect is associated with a ∼2-fold increase in cell surface EAAC1 that is independent of synthesis of new transporters but is instead related to a redistribution of EAAC1 from a subcellular compartment to the cell surface (22Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDGF also causes an increase in both EAAC1-mediated activity and cell surface expression in C6 glioma that is blocked with inhibitors of PI3K. These effects of PDGF are not blocked by PKC antagonists, suggesting that two independent signaling pathways regulate EAAC1 trafficking (19Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 5228-5327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transfection of C6 glioma with the neurotensin receptor subtype 1 and activation of this receptor also cause a redistribution of EAAC1 that is not blocked by inhibitors of either PKC or PI3K (23Najimi M. Maloteaux J.M. Hermans E. FEB Lett. 2002; 523: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). There is evidence for an association between regulated trafficking of EAAC1 and models of learning and memory. Levenson and coworkers (24Levenson J. Weeber E. Selcher J.C. Kategaya L.S. Sweatt J.D. Eskin A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 5: 155-161Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have shown a redistribution of EAAC1 from an intracellular pool to the cell surface in both long term potentiation and contextual fear conditioning. However, the mechanisms by which these events regulate EAAC1 trafficking have not been identified. To begin to define the mechanisms by which PMA and PDGF might regulate EAAC1 cell surface expression, we examined the kinetics of EAAC1 trafficking to or from the cell surface and the effects of phorbol ester or PDGF on these events. Here we report that there is robust basal trafficking of the transporter and that both PMA and PDGF increased the delivery of EAAC1 to the membrane. PMA, but not PDGF, also inhibited net internalization of EAAC1. At a lower temperature (18 °C), basal delivery of EAAC1 to the plasma membrane was unaffected, but the cell surface increases induced by either PMA or PDGF were blocked. Basal delivery of EAAC1 to the plasma membrane was comparably rapid in primary neuronal cultures, where the cellular milieu is more likely to mimic that observed in vivo. Based on these findings, we conclude that: (i) EAAC1 trafficking to and from the cell surface in both C6 and neurons is rapid compared with many other membrane proteins; (ii) although both PKC and PDGF increase cell surface expression, they appear to have differential effects on delivery and internalization of the transporter; and (iii) basal and regulated delivery of EAAC1 to the plasma membrane may originate from distinct intracellular pools. Materials—C6 glioma were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). DMEM, trypsin-EDTA, Neurobasal medium, B27 supplement, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). Culture plates were purchased from Corning (Cambridge, MA). GenePorter transfection reagent was purchased from Gene Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA). BSA, MesNa, PMA, and polyclonal anti-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PDGF was purchased from Calbiochem. Radioisotopes were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (NHS-biotin), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin), UltraLink immobilized monomeric avidin, and the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit were purchased from Pierce. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase IgG, rainbow molecular weight marker, and enhanced chemiluminescence kits were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. laboratories (South San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal anti-EAAC1 and GLT1 antibodies were the kind gifts of Dr. Jeffrey D. Rothstein (Johns Hopkins University). Cell Culture—C6 glioma were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were passaged less than 30 times and used between 75 and 85% confluence. There was no evidence for passage-dependent changes in morphology or effects measured in the present study. Multiple growth factors are present in fetal bovine serum, and, thus, to examine the effects of a single growth factor it was necessary to remove serum with preincubation for 2 h in DMEM containing (0.5%) BSA (19Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 5228-5327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The cells were then rinsed twice with and treated in plain DMEM. Primary neuron-enriched cultures were derived from embryonic (days 18–19) Sprague-Dawley rat cortex. After removal of the meninges, cortex was isolated, trypsinized for 20 min at 37 °C, and triturated in a Pasteur pipette. The cells were then plated in 10-cm dishes at a density of 4 × 106 cells/dish. Neuronal cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For all experiments, neurons were used at 14 days in vitro and treated in conditioned media. Transfection of C6 Glioma Cells—C6 glioma were grown to 40–60% confluence and transfected ∼24 h before experimental use. Cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of green fluorescent protein plasmid DNA and 8 μg of GLT-1 plasmid DNA using 50 μl of GenePorter cationic lipid reagent per the manufacturer's instructions. After a 3- to 5-h incubation with the transfection mixture in 5 ml of DMEM, 5 ml of modified medium (DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin) was added to the mixture for an additional 15 h. The media was changed to C6 media prior to serum starvation and experimental use. Green fluorescent protein was included as a control for the homogeneity of transfection across multiple plates. Transfection efficiency was consistently between 10 and 15% of cells. Measurement of Na+-dependent Transport Activity—Na+-dependent l-Glu transport activity was measured as previously described (25Dowd L.A. Coyle A.J. Rothstein J.D. Pritchett D.B. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, C6 glioma were grown in 12-well plates to 70–90% confluence, and cells were preincubated for 2 h in DMEM containing (0.5%) BSA prior to treatment. Cells were first rinsed twice (1 ml per well) with plain DMEM either pre-warmed to 37 °C or pre-cooled to 18 °C and treated with PDGF (10 μg/ml) or vehicle (4 mm HCl with 0.01% BSA) at these temperatures for 15 min. Both sets of cells were then rinsed twice with either sodium- or choline-containing buffer at 18 °C. Uptake was initiated by rinsing into the same buffers containing l-[3H]glutamate (0.5 μm) and terminated after 5 min by rinsing into ice-cold choline-containing buffer (3 washes), after which the cells were solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH. Radioactivity was determined using a Beckman scintillation counter. Na+-dependent transport activity was normalized to the amount of protein in each well. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Both C6 glioma and neuronal cell monolayers were first rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.35) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm MgCl2. The cells were then incubated in 2 ml of biotinylation solution (1 mg/ml NHS-biotin in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+) for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The biotinylation solution was removed, and excess biotinylating reagent was quenched by rinsing the cells twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine, and incubation in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+/glycine for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ before being lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors for 30 min. The cells were scraped from the plates, and the lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,500 rpm. After removal of the cellular debris, an aliquot of lysate was frozen for protein analysis. In addition, an aliquot was mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE (4×) loading buffer and labeled as the “lysate” fraction. Another aliquot (300 μl) was incubated overnight with 250 μl of UltraLink monomeric avidin-coated Sepharose beads solution. After centrifugation for 15 min, an aliquot of the resulting supernatant was diluted into an equal volume of (4×) loading buffer and labeled as the “non-biotinylated” fraction. The beads were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and then sequentially with a “high-salt” (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) solution, and a “low-salt” solution (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), with centrifugation between each wash as per the manufacturer's instructions. The beads were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature in (2×) SDS-PAGE loading buffer (600 μl) followed by an additional incubation of 30 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was collected as the “biotinylated” fraction. Delivery of EAAC1 to the Plasma Membrane—Biotinylation under trafficking-permissive conditions was carried out as follows. C6 glioma or primary neurons were rinsed twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ solution at 37 °Cor18 °C, and then incubated with 4 ml of biotinylation solution at the same temperature for different periods of time. In some experiments, cells were treated with either PMA or PDGF during biotinylation. After rinsing cells into ice-cold PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ solution containing glycine to stop trafficking, biotinylated proteins were extracted as described above. Internalization of EAAC1—Reversible biotinylation was performed as previously described (26Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After the preincubation with DMEM/BSA solution, cells were rinsed twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ solution at 4 °C and then cell surface proteins were labeled with the reversible biotinylating reagent NHS-SS-biotin (2 ml of 1 mg/ml). After 30 min, excess biotinylating reagent was quenched with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+/glycine as described above. Cells were rapidly rinsed twice with pre-warmed (37 °C) plain DMEM and incubated for varying periods of time. To halt internalization, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold sodium-Tris (NT) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% BSA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.6) followed by an incubation for an additional 10 min. Cell surface-bound biotinylating reagent was stripped by incubating the cells twice for 25 min in NT buffer containing freshly dissolved 50 mm MesNa. MesNa was only used for 6 months after date of purchase. In each experiment, one plate labeled “No MesNa” did not undergo re-warming or subsequent stripping of biotinylating reagent to provide a measure of the total pool of cell surface transporter available for internalization. A second plate, labeled “t = 0,” did not undergo re-warming before having cell surface-bound biotinylating reagent stripped, to control for the efficiency of the MesNa reagent. Both of these controls were rinsed into NT buffer, and all stripping occurred at the same time. After removal of cell surface-bound biotinylating reagent, cells were rinsed twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ buffer, and biotinylated proteins were extracted as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of lysate from individual samples containing equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were loaded in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Equal volumes of all three fractions were analyzed, such that if the yield from the extraction of biotinylated proteins was 100%, the sum of the amount of immunoreactivity in the non-biotinylated and biotinylated fractions should equal the amount of immunoreactivity in the lysate. When the number of samples exceeded the number of lanes available in a single mini-gel, then two gels were prepared with aliquots of lysate from each sample present in both gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. These membranes were blocked with Tris buffer containing (0.1%) Tween 20 and 1% nonfat milk and probed with specific antibodies to EAAC1 (1:75), GLT-1 (1:10,000), or transferrin receptor (TfR: 1 μg/ml). All blots were also probed with an anti-actin antibody (1:5,000) to control for possible cell lysis prior to biotinylation. Proteins were visualized using ECL as per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoreactivity was quantified using National Institutes of Health Image software (available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). In some cases, different exposures of the film were used to quantify different immunoreactive bands to ensure that the signal was within the linear range. Immunoreactivity of each sample was normalized to the amount of actin in the lysate fraction of that sample from the same gel and expressed as a percentage of the amount of immunoreactivity observed in the control sample within each fraction. Data are presented as the (means ± S.E. of the mean) and compared using ANOVA. Time Course for PMA- and PDGF-induced Increases in Cell Surface EAAC1—Before determining if PMA or PDGF affect the rates of delivery or removal of EAAC1 from cell surface, it was necessary to examine the time course for the effects of these agents on cell surface expression. C6 glioma, a brain-derived cell line that endogenously expresses EAAC1 and none of the other Na+-dependent glutamate transporters (22Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were treated with the phorbol ester, PMA, for different periods of time. Cell surface expression of EAAC1 was examined using a membrane-impermeant biotinylating reagent followed by batch extraction of the biotinylated proteins with avidin-coated beads. Under control conditions, ∼20% of EAAC1 was found in the biotinylated fraction; this is consistent with the large pool of intracellular immunoreactivity observed with confocal microscopy (20González M.I. Kazanietz M.G. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under identical conditions, the same biotinylating reagent captures greater than 80% of the homologous transporter, GLT-1, providing evidence that the reaction conditions are appropriate for efficient labeling of cell surface proteins (27Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45741-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PMA caused a significant increase in EAAC1 cell surface expression within 2 min and a nearly 2-fold increase in cell surface expression within 15 min (Fig. 1, A and B). The change in surface expression was maximal at 15 min and was not significantly different from control with 60 min of treatment. PDGF increased cell surface expression of EAAC1 with a similar time-course having a maximal effect at 15 min. 2A. L. Sheldon and M. B. Robinson, unpublished observations. Notably, neither PMA nor PDGF caused a complete redistribution of EAAC1 from the intracellular pools to the cell surface. It is not known if this observation is related to “desensitization/down-regulation” of the signaling pathway or depletion of a specific “regulated pool” of EAAC1 that can be redistributed to the cell surface. These studies identify 15 min as a critical time for determining if PMA or PDGF affect delivery or removal of EAAC1 from the cell surface. Rate of Delivery of EAAC1 to the Cell Surface under Basal Conditions—Other membrane proteins, including the TfR, DAT, GAT-1, the choline transporter, and GLUT4, have been reported to recycle rapidly to and from the cell surface (for reviews, see Refs. 15Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 18Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28Buckley K.M. Melikian H.E. Provoda C.J. Waring M.T. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To measure the rate of delivery of EAAC1 to the cell surface, C6 glioma were incubated under trafficking permissive conditions (37 °C) in the presence of the biotinylating reagent. Under these conditions, the membrane-impermeant biotinylating reagent should label transporters that cycle through the plasma membrane. In each experiment, the amount of EAAC1 that was biotinylated under conditions not permissive to trafficking (4 °C) was also examined, and the amount of transporter delivered to the cell surface was expressed as a percentage of this steady-state measure of transporter surface expression. At 37 °C, there was a time-dependent increase in the amount of biotinylated protein (Fig. 2, A and B). There was no evidence for changes in the amount of biotinylated actin, providing evidence that this increase in biotinylated EAAC1 cannot be attributed to labeling of intracellular pools of EAAC1. The increase in biotinylated EAAC1 was accompanied by a decrease in the amount of transporter in the non-biotinylated fraction and no change in the total amount of EAAC1 immunoreactivity in the cell lysates (Fig. 2, A and B). Within 15 min, there was nearly a 2-fold increase in the amount of biotinylated EAAC1, implying that the entire population of cell surface transporter was replaced over this time period to maintain the steady-state level of cell surface EAAC1. There was a continued increase in the amount of biotinylated transporter at 30 and 60 min consistent with this rapid rate of turnover of cell surface EAAC1. To test the validity of this approach, the rate of delivery of TfR was examined. Consistent with previous studies in other cellular systems, the amount of biotinylated TfR increased in a time-dependent manner with nearly the entire population being labeled within 30 min (Fig. 2C). Although the acylation reaction between the activated carboxylic acid (NHS-ester) of the biotinylating reagent and the primary amine (typically lysine) from a cell surface protein is thought to be quite fast (29Morpurgo M. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1999; 38: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Miller B.T. Collins T.J. Rogers M.E. Kurosky A. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), labeling of transporter that cycles through the plasma membrane may not be 100% efficient. Therefore, these values may represent an underestimate of the rate of delivery/removal of transporter to and from the cell surface under basal conditions but are consistent with a half-life for turnover of no longer than ∼5–7 min. Rate of Internalization of EAAC1—As a complementary approach, EAAC1 internalization was examined using a reversible biotinylation strategy. C6 glioma cells were incubated with a disulfide bond-containing biotinylating reagent at 4 °C to label cell surface proteins. After re-warming to trafficking-permissive conditions for various periods of time, cells were cooled and cell surface-bound biotinylating reagent was removed by treatment with MesNa, a membrane-impermeant reducing agent. Using this approach, 21.5 ± 6.9% of EAAC1 was biotinylated at steady state, consistent with our other studies; this sets the upper limit for the amount of transporter that could become inaccessible to MesNa (internalized). With no re-warming, slightly more than 80% of the biotinylating reagent can be stripped (Fig. 3, A and B; 0 min at 37 °C before MesNa). The 20% of biotinylating reagent that cannot be removed with MesNa is presumably related to incomplete stripping of cell surface biotinylating reagent by MesNa, but may also be related to inaccessibility of this pool to MesNa (31Schmidt A. Hannah M.J. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). With this approach, we observed a time-dependent increase in the amount of biotinylated transporter that became inaccessible to MesNa (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to the half-life estimated from measurement of delivery of transporter to the cell surface, only slightly greater than 50% of the biotinylated EAAC1 appeared to be internalized within 15 min. It is possible that internalized transporter rapidly recycles, that C6 glioma contain a reducing environment that cleaves the disulfide bond in the spacer arm of the biotinylating reagent, or that having only 20% of the transporter on the cell surface under steady state limits detection of internalized transporter at early time points. To address these possibilities, C6 glioma cells were treated with PMA to increase the pool of EAAC1 available for internalization from the cell surface. After incubation with PMA for 15 min, cells underwen"
https://openalex.org/W2136625993,"NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related) kinase belongs to a family of kinases that is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic world. We showed previously that NDR is regulated by phosphorylation and by the Ca2+-binding protein, S100B. The budding yeast relatives of Homo sapiens NDR, Cbk1, and Dbf2, were shown to interact with Mob2 (Mps one binder 2) and Mob1, respectively. This interaction is required for the activity and biological function of these kinases. In this study, we show that hMOB1, the closest relative of yeast Mob1 and Mob2, stimulates NDR kinase activity and interacts with NDR both in vivo and in vitro. The point mutations of highly conserved residues within the N-terminal domain of NDR reduced NDR kinase activity as well as human MOB1 binding. A novel feature of NDR kinases is an insert within the catalytic domain between subdomains VII and VIII. The amino acid sequence within this insert shows a high basic amino acid content in all of the kinases of the NDR family known to interact with MOB proteins. We show that this sequence is autoinhibitory, and our data indicate that the binding of human MOB1 to the N-terminal domain of NDR induces the release of this autoinhibition.

Hemmings B.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The NDR family consists of the mammalian protein kinases NDR1 and NDR2, Drosophila melanogaster NDR, Caenorhabditis elegans SAX1, mammalian, D. melanogaster and C. elegans large tumor suppressor kinases, Neurospora crassa COT1, Ustilago maydis UKC1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cbk1, Dbf2, and Dbf20, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Orb6 and Sid2, and several plant kinases (1Manning G.

These kinases share a high sequence conservation, and some possess conserved functions, mainly involving regulation of cell morphology and the cell cycle (2Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J.

Gould K.L. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase domain sequence of NDR is related to that of other members of the AGC group of kinases, e.g. protein kinases A, B, C, and G, PRK, p70S6K, p90RSK, and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (1Manning G. Plowman G.D. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). NDR contains all 12 subdomains of the kinase catalytic domain as described by Hanks and Hunter (16Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). However, the catalytic domains of all of the members of the NDR family are interrupted by an insert of 30–60 amino acids between subdomains VII and VIII. This inserted sequence is not well conserved but is always rich in the basic amino acids, arginine and lysine. The catalytic domain insert has been shown to act as a non-consensus nuclear localization signal in the case of NDR1. NDR1 localizes predominantly to the nucleus in COS-1 cells, whereas mutant NDR1 with a deletion in the insert is localized to the cytosol (17Millward T. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An additional special feature of the NDR family of kinases is a highly conserved N-terminal domain. In the case of NDR1, this domain consists of 81 amino acids and encompasses a region predicted to form an amphiphilic α-helix that binds to the EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, S100B (18Millward T.A. Heizmann C.W. Schafer B.W. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Finally, the C-terminal extension of NDR kinase contains a broadly conserved hydrophobic motif phosphorylation site that is an important regulatory site within the AGC group of kinases (19Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). NDR kinase is efficiently (20–100-fold) activated upon treatment of cells with the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (OA). OA treatment induces the phosphorylation of the activation segment site, Ser-281, and the hydrophobic motif site, Thr-444 (20Millward T.A. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33847-33850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have shown that Ser-281 is autophosphorylated, whereas Thr-444 is targeted by an as yet unidentified upstream kinase. Both sites are crucial for NDR activity in vivo and in vitro. NDR activation is Ca2+-dependent as shown by the treatment of COS-1 cells with the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM, which abolishes NDR activation. It has been shown that the EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, S100B, binds to the N-terminal domain of NDR in vivo and in vitro and that Ca2+/S100B activates NDR in vitro. S100B induces increased autophosphorylation on Ser-281. During investigations of the mechanism of S100B-induced autophosphorylation, a third autophosphorylation site, Thr-74, in the N-terminal domain was discovered (21Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Rogniaux H. Stegert M.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6710-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This site is also crucial for NDR activation, because its mutation to alanine affected NDR activity in vivo. The results of several recent studies indicate a novel conserved signaling pathway involving NDR kinase family members. It has been shown in D. melanogaster that NDR genetically interacts with FURRY, a 300-kDa protein of unknown function (22Cong J. Geng W. He B. Liu J. Charlton J. Adler P.N. Development. 2001; 128: 2793-2802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the FURRY relative, Tao3/Pag1, lies on the Cbk1 pathway. Furthermore, Tao3/Pag1 and Cbk1 interact physically and their localization is interdependent (23Du L.L. Novick P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, the FURRY-like protein, Mor2/Cps12, interacts physically with Orb6, the S. pombe NDR orthologue (24Hirata D. Kishimoto N. Suda M. Sogabe Y. Nakagawa S. Yoshida Y. Sakai K. Mizunuma M. Miyakawa T. Ishiguro J. Toda T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4863-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The FURRY-like proteins are conserved in mammals, and thus, it is likely that other proteins interacting genetically and/or physically with S. cerevisiae Cbk1 or Dbf2 also play a role in the NDR kinase family pathway in higher eukaryotes. Most of these proteins are fairly well conserved throughout evolution. S. cerevisiae Mob1 is a member of the mitotic exit network (25Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Luca F.C. Mody M. Kurischko C. Roof D.M. Giddings T.H. Winey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6972-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Dbf2 associates with Mob1, and Mob1 is required for phosphorylation and activation of Dbf2 (27Mah A.S. Jang J. Deshaies R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7325-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Mob2, a close relative of Mob1, is a member of the Cbk1 pathway. Mob2 is required for the biological function of Cbk1 in the mother/daughter separation after cytokinesis and maintenance of polarized cell growth. Mob2 associates physically with Cbk1, and Cbk1 kinase activity is dependent on Mob2. Furthermore, Mob2 and Cbk1 show interdependent localization (28Colman-Lerner A. Chin T.E. Brent R. Cell. 2001; 107: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Weiss E.L. Kurischko C. Zhang C. Shokat K. Drubin D.G. Luca F.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 885-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, S. pombe Mob2 interacts physically with the protein kinase Orb6 and is required for Orb6 function in the coordination of cell polarity with the cell cycle (30Hou M.C. Wiley D.J. Verde F.

Multicellular organisms possess highly conserved MOB proteins. hMOB1α shares a sequence identity/similarity of 50/65% with S. cerevisiae Mob2 and of 57/78% with S. pombe Mob1. The human MOB protein family consists of two almost identical proteins, hMOB1α and hMOB1β (NCBI accession numbers Gi8922671 and 27735029), sharing a sequence identity/similarity of 95/97%; a more distantly related protein, hMOB2 (NCBI accession numbers Gi38091156), that is 41/60% identical/similar to hMOB1α; three other related proteins, hMOB3 α, β, and γ (Gi18677731, 41350330, and 3809115), with an identity/similarity of ∼50/73% to hMOB1α; and the weakly similar protein, phocein (Gi41349451), that is 24/45% identical/similar to hMOB1α. Because the nomenclature of MOB proteins in the data bases is rather confusing, we use the above terminology based on homology as also proposed recently by Stravridi et al. (31Stavridi E.S. Harris K.G. Huyen Y. Bothos J. Verwoerd P.M. Stayrook S.E. Pavletich N.P. Jeffrey P.D. Luca F.C.

To date, no functional domains have been identified in the MOB proteins and the hMOB proteins have no known functions. It has been shown that the MOB relative, phocein, interacts with the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit, striatin, and with proteins involved in vesicular traffic (32Moreno C.S. Lane W.S.

Here, we characterize the interaction of hMOB1α, the closest relative of yeast Mob1 and Mob2, with human NDR kinase. We show that hMOB1 binding is dependent on the N-terminal domain of NDR and that hMOB1 stimulates NDR kinase activity both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we show that a basic sequence within the insert in the catalytic domain of NDR has an autoinhibitory function and that hMOB1 may stimulate NDR activity by releasing the autoinhibitory effect of this sequence. Cell Culture—COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected at the subconfluent stage with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, the cells were treated for 60 min with 1 μm OA in 0.1% N,N-dimethylformamide or 50 μm BAPTA-AM in 0.1% Me2SO 48 h after transfection. Plasmids—Mammalian expression vector pCMV5 encoding HA-tagged NDR1 was described previously (21Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Rogniaux H. Stegert M.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

The cloning details and vector maps are available upon request. pCMV5 HA-NDR1 and pSHP-NDR2 point mutations were generated from wild-type vectors using the QuikChange site mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) and the appropriate primers (primer sequences are available upon request). The sequences of all of the plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—Phosphorylated anti-Ser-281 and anti-Thr-444 antibodies were as described previously (21Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J.

Phosphorylated anti-Thr-74 rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide, AHARKET(PO4)EFLRLK. The 12CA5 (HA) and the 9E10 (Myc) monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatants were used for detection of HA-NDR and Myc-hMOB1. Anti-GST-NDR polyclonal antibody was as described previously (17Millward T. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—To detect HA-NDR, SHP-NDR, and Myc-hMOB1, samples were resolved by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% skimmed milk powder and then probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-GST NDR rabbit polyclonal antibody, 12CA5 (HA) monoclonal antibody supernatant, 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody supernatant, anti-Thr-444P, anti-Ser-281P, or anti Thr-74P. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies, or Myc-hMOB1 in HA immunoprecipitations were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A/G and ECL. Bacterial Expression of Human GST-fused hMOB1 and Human SHP-fused NDR2—XL-1 Blue Escherichia coli was transformed with the pGEX-2T-hMOB1 plasmid. Mid-logarithmic phase cells were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 20 °C. Bacteria were disrupted using a French press in the presence of 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and the fusion proteins were purified on glutathioneagarose. SHP-NDR2 wild-type and mutant plasmids were transformed into XL-1 Blue E. coli, and the protein was produced as described for GST-hMOB1 and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose. HA-NDR Kinase Assay—Transfected COS-1 cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate before lysis in 500 μl of IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 μm microcystin, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and duplicate aliquots (250 μg) of the supernatant were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 60 min and mixed subsequently for 3 h at 4 °C with 12CA5 antibody prebound to protein A-Sepharose. The beads were then washed twice with IP buffer, once for 10 min with IP buffer containing 1 m NaCl, again for 10 min with IP buffer, and finally twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4 μm leupeptin and 1 mm benzamidine. Thereafter, the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1,000 cpm/pmol), 1 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, 4 μm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm microcystin, and 1 mm NDR1 substrate peptide (KKRNRRLSVA). After a 60-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were processed as described previously (21Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Rogniaux H. Stegert M.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6710-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). SHP-NDR Kinase Assay—1 μg of purified recombinant SHP-NDR wild type and mutants (without further treatment or pre-autophosphorylated in the presence of 10 μm GST-hMOB1 or GST) were assayed in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1,000 cpm/pmol), and 1 mm NDR1 substrate peptide (KKRNRRLSVA). After incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were processed and kinase activity was determined as described for the HA-NDR kinase assay. Immunoprecipitations—COS-1 cells transfected with HA-NDR wild type or mutants and Myc-hMOB1 were harvested as described above. Cell lysate protein (0.5 mg) was precleared with protein A- or G-Sepharose and mixed subsequently for 3 h at 4 °C with 12CA5 antibody prebound to protein A-Sepharose or with 9E10 antibody prebound to protein G-Sepharose. The beads then were washed twice with IP buffer, once with IP buffer containing 1 m NaCl, once again with IP buffer, and finally twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4 μm leupeptin and 1 mm benzamidine. Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and Myc-hMOB1 and HA-NDR were detected by Western blotting. GST Pull-down Assay—25-μg aliquots of GST or GST-hMOB1 were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and then 5-μg aliquots of SHP-NDR wild type or mutants were added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline and resuspended in 30 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, and the samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. NDR bound to GST-hMOB1 was detected by Western blotting. hMOB1 Activates NDR—Previous work by other groups has shown in yeast that Mob1 and Mob2 are required for the activity of the NDR-related kinases Dbf2 and Cbk1, respectively (26Luca F.C.

A. 2001; 98: 7325-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To test whether hMOB1 also plays a role in NDR activation, we co-transfected Myc-hMOB1 or the empty vector with HA-NDR1 into COS-1 cells. The cells were treated with the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor, OA. To date, OA is the only known potent activator of NDR in vivo (20Millward T.A. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33847-33850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Rogniaux H. Stegert M.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6710-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and it has been shown that yeast Mob1 becomes phosphorylated after OA treatment (27Mah A.S. Jang J. Deshaies R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7325-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated HA-NDR1 was stimulated 35-fold by a 45-min treatment of 1 μm OA (Fig. 1A). Co-expression of Myc-hMOB1 induced an additional 2–3-fold increase in NDR kinase activity (Fig. 1A). At the 45-min OA time point, HA-NDR1 co-expressed with Myc-hMOB1 was stimulated 100-fold compared with the control. This indicates a role for hMOB1 in NDR activation. To test whether hMOB1 acts directly on NDR, we performed in vitro kinase assays of bacterially expressed SHP-NDR2 in the presence of GST-hMOB1 or GST. We used NDR2 for in vitro experiments, because it can be readily produced in sufficient amounts. NDR2, which is 86% identical to NDR1, has been shown to be regulated in the same way as NDR1 (34Stegert M.R. Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Hergovich A. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23806-23812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we confirmed with NDR1 produced in Sf9 cells that wild-type NDR1 behaves in vitro similar to NDR2 with respect to hMOB1 (data not shown). GST-hMOB1 stimulated SHP-NDR2 autophosphorylation ∼2-fold (data not shown). Furthermore, SHP-NDR2, which was pre-autophosphorylated in the presence of GST-hMOB1, has up to a 6-fold higher kinase activity against the NDR substrate peptide than SHP-NDR pre-autophosphorylated in the presence of GST (Fig. 1B). These results show that hMOB1 has a direct positive effect on NDR kinase activity. We tested the effect of hMOB1 on the phosphorylation state of the NDR phosphorylation sites Thr-74, Ser-281, and Thr-444 (Thr-75, Ser-282, and Thr-442 in the case of NDR2; the phosphorylation sites of NDR2 were recognized by phosphospecific antibodies generated against the corresponding phosphorylation sites of NDR1). SHP-NDR2 phosphorylation on the autophosphorylation sites Ser-282 and Thr-75 was slightly increased, whereas Thr-442 of SHP-NDR2, which is known to be targeted by an upstream kinase in vivo, showed no autophosphorylation (Fig. 1B). hNDR1 Interacts with hMOB1—To investigate whether hMOB1, the closest relative of yeast MOB2 and MOB1 in mammals, is able to interact with NDR1, epitope-tagged NDR1 and hMOB1 were co-transfected into COS-1 cells. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments of Myc-hMOB1 with HA-NDR1 (Fig. 2A) as well as those of HA-NDR with Myc-hMOB1 (Fig. 2B), hMOB1 associated with NDR1. The protein level of Myc-hMOB1 was dramatically increased upon OA stimulation, whereas Myc-hMOB1 transfected without NDR1 was present at similar levels in OA-treated and OA-untreated cells. We did not address the molecular basis of this phenomenon. The kinase-dead mutant with the mutated catalytic lysine in the ATP binding site, K118A, was still able to interact with hMOB1 after OA stimulation (Fig. 2A). Thus, the interaction was not dependent on NDR kinase activity. Furthermore, we tested whether the two important in vivo phosphorylation sites of NDR, Ser-281 and Thr-444, as well as a recently identified in vitro autophosphorylation site, Thr-74, play a role in NDR-MOB interaction. The NDR mutants S281A and T444A still interacted with hMOB1 after OA stimulation, whereas the T74A mutant showed almost complete absence of interaction with hMOB1 (data not shown). NDR-hMOB1 Interaction Depends on OA-induced Modification on hMOB1, whereas Phosphorylation of NDR Is Not Required—Myc-hMOB1 interacted with HA-NDR1 in OA-treated COS-1 cells, but it was not clear whether OA acted just by increasing the Myc-hMOB1 protein level or whether OA-induced modification of NDR1, hMOB1, or both promoted the interaction. To address this question, we transfected HA-NDR1 and Myc-hMOB1 separately into COS-1 cells and stimulated them with 1 μm OA or left them unstimulated. We then pooled the lysates (NDR1 ± OA with hMOB1 ± OA) and immunoprecipitated with α-HA antibody. In the two combinations containing Myc-hMOB1 of OA-treated cells, Myc-hMOB1 strongly associated with HA-NDR, regardless of whether the HA-NDR was expressed in OA-treated or unstimulated cells. Myc-hMOB1 from unstimulated cells showed only a weak interaction with HA-NDR from both unstimulated and OA-stimulated cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, OA-induced phosphorylation of NDR is not required for interaction but hMOB1 modification is necessary. Furthermore, GST-hMOB1 was phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated HA-NDR. The phosphorylation of GST-hMOB1 increased 3–4-fold when HA-NDR was immunoprecipitated from OA-stimulated COS-1 cells. However, the phosphorylation of GST-hMOB1 was also observed when kinase-dead HA-NDR was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2D). We conclude that a kinase that co-immunoprecipitates with NDR is able to phosphorylate hMOB1. The Highly Conserved N-terminal Domain of NDR Is Required for Kinase Activation—The N-terminal regulatory domain of NDR kinase is highly conserved in the closest relatives of NDR throughout the eukaryotic world (Fig. 3A). Several residues are completely invariant throughout evolution from single cell organisms to humans. This prompted us to test the functional significance of these residues with respect to NDR kinase activity. Mutations of the highly conserved residues induced strong inhibition of OA-stimulated kinase activity (Fig. 3B). The first part of the N-terminal domain covering amino acids 1–33 and containing a predicted β-sheet in hNDR proved to be important for kinase activation. The deletion of the first 30 amino acids completely abolished kinase activation (data not shown). The point mutations in this region strongly reduced kinase activity. The mutation of Thr-16, Glu-18, and Glu-28 reduced activity to ∼40%, whereas the mutation of Lys-24 and Tyr-31 reduced activity to ∼20%. Mutation to alanine of Arg-41, Arg-44, or Leu-48, all of which lie in a predicted first α-helix covering the amino acids 40–55 and are situated close together on the same side of the predicted α-helix, reduced kinase activity to below 20% of wild-type activity. Mutation of the residues in a predicted second α-helix situated in the previously described S100B binding region of NDR and covering amino acids 60–80 also led to the inhibition of kinase activity. Mutation of Lys-72, Glu-73, Thr-74, Arg-78, and Leu-79 to alanine reduced kinase activity to 20% or lower. Taken together, the results imply that the high conservation of the N-terminal domain in the following termed SMA (S100B and MOB Association) domain is due to an absolute requirement of the conserved residues for proper kinase function, either by ensuring the correct structural conformation of the protein or being directly involved in binding to interacting proteins. The SMA Domain Is Required for NDR-MOB Interaction— Thr-74, which was previously shown to be important for NDR kinase activity and interaction with S100B, also turned out to be required for NDR-hMOB1 interaction in COS-1 cells. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of the conserved residues of the SMA domain in NDR-hMOB1 interaction. Co-transfection of HA-tagged NDR mutants and Myc-hMOB1 and subsequent co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-MOB with HA-NDR revealed that several of the conserved residues important for kinase activation are also required for NDR-hMOB1 interaction (Fig. 4, A–C). Tyr-31, Arg-41, Thr-74, and Arg-78 seem to be absolutely required for interaction, whereas the Lys-24, Arg-44, and Leu-79 mutants displayed reduced interaction. Only three of the mutants with a strongly reduced kinase activity (Arg-48, Lys-72, and Glu-73) showed no decrease in the ability to bind hMOB1. Tyr-32 of NDR2 Kinase Is Essential for Activa"

The therapeutic use of d-polyarginines is especially interesting because they are not cleaved by furin and possess inhibitory potency almost equal to l-polyarginines. In this study we attempted to determine the important elements within polyarginines that contribute to effective inhibition. Structure-function analyses of polyarginine peptides showed that inhibition by polyarginine-containing peptides appeared to depend on the total number of basic charges of the positively charged inhibitors bound to the negatively charged substrate binding pocket; peptide positioning did not appear to be rigorously determined. Screening of l- and d-decapeptide positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries indicated a preference for basic residues in nearly all positions, similar to previous results with hexapeptide libraries. Length and terminal modification studies showed that the most potent d-polyarginine tested was nona-d-arginine (D9R) amide with a Ki of 1.3 nm. D9R amide was shown to protect RAW264.7 cells against anthrax toxemia with an IC50 of 3.7 μm. Because of its high stability, specificity, low toxicity, small molecular weight, and extremely low Ki against furin, D9R amide or its derivatives may represent promising compounds for therapeutic use.

Furin is a mammalian subtilisin/Kex2p-like endoprotease that is involved in the processing of many precursor proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Nakayama K. Biochem.

The enzyme has a ubiquitous tissue distribution and cycles between the trans-Golgi network, the cell surface, and the endosomes. Furin plays a role in embryogenesis and homeostasis (4Roebroek A.J.

Moreover, D6R amide has been shown to block the activation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (8Sarac M.S. Cameron A. Lindberg I. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7136-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and to protect against anthrax toxemia both in vivo and in vitro (9Sarac M.S. Peinado J.R. Leppla S.H. Lindberg I. Infect. Immun. 2003; 72: 602-605Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The structure of mouse furin has been recently determined (10Henrich S. Cameron A. Bourenkov G.P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Lindberg I. Bode W. Than M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and reveals that the active site of the enzyme contains an extended substrate-binding groove that is lined with many negatively charged residues: these include Asp-258 and Asp-306 (surrounding the S1 subsite); Asp-154 and Asp-191, which form the surface of the S2 pocket; Glu-236 and Glu-264 (S4 subsite); Glu-257 and Glu-264 (Glu-264 takes part in forming the S4 and S5 subsites); and Glu-230 and Asp-233 (S6 subsite). No basic residues are present in the general area between the S5 and S1 subsites; basic residues (Arg-193, His-364, and Arg-197) are found only on the outer edge of the S1′ subsite. The highly acidic character of the substrate-binding groove explains the high inhibitory potency of positively charged polyarginine-containing peptides. In the work described here we present the further study of the inhibitory features of polyarginines against human furin. We attempted to gain information on the positioning of D6R amide within the furin substrate-binding pocket. We also scanned decapeptide libraries in search of a highly inhibitory sequence and tested how length and terminal modification can influence the inhibitory potency of d-arginine-containing peptides. Materials—The positional scanning decapeptide libraries and other peptides were synthesized at the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies (San Diego, CA). If not stated otherwise, all peptides were carboxyl-terminal amidated, with free amino termini. The decapeptide library consisted of 200 l-or d-peptide mixtures, divided into 10 groups corresponding to each position within the decapeptide. For each position, 20 mixtures were surveyed, each of which was defined by one of the 20 natural amino acids. The undefined positions were occupied by any of the amino acids except cysteine. The positional scanning library and the individual compounds were synthesized using simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis methodology as described previously (7Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Concentration of Peptides—Although the peptides used in this study were over 99% pure, these highly basic peptides consisted of more than half salt (trifluoroacetate) and water; the actual molar concentration was thus smaller than expected. The amount of peptide in each stock was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis at the Microchemical Facility at the Winship Cancer Institute (Atlanta, GA). Using amino acid analysis, D6R, D7R, D8R, and D9R amides were shown to contain 36%, 36%, 48, and 31% (w/w), respectively, of actual peptide. Unless otherwise stated (in the figure legends), we here report peptide concentrations taking the required correction into account. Where the actual amino acid composition is not known (i.e. the peptides described in Figs. 2 and 5), this correction has not been made.Fig. 5Inhibition constants for polyarginines with different carboxyl-terminal modifications against furin. The rate of hydrolysis of pERTKR-MCA was determined in the presence of various concentrations of the peptides (each in duplicate or triplicate) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each Ki value (depicted above the bar) is the mean ± S.D.

W. Creemers (11Ayoubi T.A. Creemers J.W. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9298-9303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO DG44 cells were stably transfected and expression-amplified using the dihydrofolate reductase-coupled amplification method as described previously (12Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Overexpression of neuropeptide precursors and processing enzymes. Methods in Neuroscience. 23. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 94-108Google Scholar). The method described for mouse furin purification (7Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) was used for purification of human furin from conditioned medium. PACE4 Preparation—Conditioned medium containing PACE4 was obtained from stably transfected HEK293 cells (13Mains R.E. Berard C.A. Denault J.B. Zhou A. Johnson R.C. Leduc R. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as described previously (7Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). One liter of medium was diluted three times with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Brij 35), loaded on a 5-ml Econo-Pac® anion exchange cartridge (Bio-Rad), and eluted using a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 45 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Enzyme Assays—The assay for furin was performed at pH 7.0 in 100 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Brij 35. The substrate and enzyme concentrations unless otherwise stated were 200 μm and 15 nm, and the total assay volume was 50 μl. Inhibitory peptides were preincubated with enzyme for 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition of substrate. All assays were performed either in duplicate or triplicate. Inhibition constants were determined as in Ref. 14Apletalina E. Appel J. Lamango N.S. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26589-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, and the equation Ki = Ki(app)/(1 + ([S]/Km)) was used. The Km value of the substrate pERTKR-methylaminocoumarin (pERTKR-MCA) for human furin was 5 μm as determined by kinetic analysis (Prism GraphPad software). Decapeptide Scanning Analysis—The decapeptide libraries were tested for furin inhibition, and the data for each sample in each experiment were normalized as follows. An absolute value (x1) representing the percent of furin inhibition was calculated for each peptide mixture of the library (all negative values of inhibition were taken as zero). Then absolute values of all peptide mixtures for a given position were summed (xtotal), and the arbitrary percentage value x2 for the particular amino acid was calculated (where x2 = [x1/xtotal] × 100%). For example, if we observe 95% inhibition of enzyme activity caused by a peptide mixture with arginine defined in the fifth position (R5) and no other residue in the fifth position is inhibitory, the peptide mixture exhibits 100% participation in overall inhibition (x2 = 100%). If in the seventh position we observe 99% inhibition by a peptide mixture defined by arginine, 99% inhibition by lysine, and 5% inhibition of alanine, we calculate that the peptide mixture defined with arginine in the seventh position (R7) creates 48.8% of total inhibition, because 99/(99 + 99 + 5) × 100% = 48.8%. Following this normalization, the means from five independent experiments could be calculated. Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assay—The inhibitory effect of D6R amide and D9R amide on anthrax toxemia was studied in RAW264.7 cells. RAW cells were cultured at 104/well in a 96-well flat-bottomed plate (Costar) and treated 12 h later with 400 ng/ml protective antigen (PA) (obtained from S. Leppla, National Institutes of Health) and 200 ng/ml lethal factor (LF) (obtained from S. Leppla, National Institutes of Health) in the presence of 1–15 μm polyarginine for 1 h. Each condition was examined in triplicate. The inhibitors were added immediately after addition of PA + LF (i.e. anthrax toxin). All experiments were repeated independently two times; the results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of the triplicates. Cell growth was monitored with the compound WST-1 (Roche Diagnostics) using the manufacturer's protocol; this assay reflects the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase present in living cells. When applied alone at 100 μm D9R amide, like D6R amide (9Sarac M.S. Peinado J.R. Leppla S.H. Lindberg I. Infect. Immun. 2003; 72: 602-605Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), did not produce any cytotoxic effects on RAW cell growth (data not shown). Inhibitor Modeling Studies—The crystal structure of mouse furin inhibited with a decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone inhibitor (10Henrich S. Cameron A. Bourenkov G.P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Lindberg I. Bode W. Than M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) was used for all modeling studies. This structure is also representative of human furin, because all amino acid residues within the active site cleft are conserved. The (l)-RRRRRRDL peptide was manually placed into the active site cleft considering i) the experimentally defined interactions between the P4 through P1 inhibitor side chains with the corresponding S4 through S1 proteinase subsites, ii) the structure of the subtilisin/eglin c complex (15Bode W. Papamokos E. Musil D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 673-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and iii) the subtilisin BPN′-prodomain complex (16Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The initial model for the retro binding of the (d)-ldrrrrrr peptide was constructed from this l-peptide by superimposing all Cα and side chain atoms following reversal of the polypeptide chain (simple retro binding). This, however, resulted in poor carbonyl-carbonyl contacts between the inhibitor and furin. For a second starting model, these poor main chain-main chain contacts were manually relieved by a 180° flipping of the inhibitor peptide groups (retro binding with flipping). In addition, this flipping reestablished favorable inter-main chain hydrogen bonds but required some Cα and side chain shifts to maintain favorable intermolecular peptide geometries. In the third model, the (d)-rrrrrrdl peptide was manually placed into the active site cleft in a direct binding mode, with optimization of all hydrogen bond and noncovalent interactions between inhibitor and enzyme. The intramolecular energy of these model peptides was minimized by MAIN (17.Turk, D. (1992) Weiterentwicklung eines Programmes fuer Molekuelgrafik und seine Andwendung auf verschiendene Protein Strukturaufklaerungen. Ph.D. thesis, Technische Universitaet, Muenchen, GermanyGoogle Scholar) using the Engh and Huber parameters (18Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 43: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar) for bond length, bond angles, dihedral angles, and improper angles. The models obtained were subsequently optimized against the fixed furin structure by molecular mechanics using the module DISCOVER (version 2.95) of INSIGHT II (version 2000; Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA), resulting in the conformations shown in Fig. 1. Energy minimization was done in vacuo using a dielectric constant of 10 and a consistent valence force-field (19Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar) regarding charges, cross, and Morse terms. After 10,000 refinement steps of the steepest descent method, a maximum derivative of the energy term of <1.0 kcal mol–1 Å–1 was reached. Determination of the Position of D6R Amide in the Substrate Binding Pocket—There are in principle two potential directionalities for the binding of the d-peptide inhibitors. They can bind somewhat similar to l-amino acid substrates, i.e. with the amino-terminal end of the peptide directed toward the S5, S6 enzyme pocket subsites and the carboxyl-terminal end placed close to the S1′, S2′ subsites. However, because of the distinct stereochemistry at most of the subsites, in particular at S1, the d-arginine side chains cannot be optimally accommodated in the subsites with the simultaneous formation of favorable main chain-main chain interactions. It is also possible that d-peptides bind in the reverse direction. The crystal structure of furin (10Henrich S. Cameron A. Bourenkov G.P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Lindberg I. Bode W. Than M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) shows a positively charged area at the edge of the S1′ specificity pocket formed by Arg-193, His-364, and Arg-197 (Fig. 1). We speculated that this positively charged area could potentially anchor a D6R peptide containing terminal acidic residues. This anchor could provide information about peptide orientation as well as possibly increase inhibitory potency. We synthesized amidated (d)-rrrrrr (D6R) and (d)-rrrr (D4R) peptides containing (d)-dl and (d)-el at either the amino or carboxyl termini and assayed these for inhibition of furin. Calculated Ki are presented in Fig. 2. In all cases the addition of negatively charged residues led to an increase in Ki. The addition of (d)-el and (d)-dl to D4R led to 30- and 120-fold increases in Ki. The addition of (d)-dl and (d)-el to D6R amide caused a several-fold increase in Ki (see Fig. 2). In all cases we observed that the addition of glutamate was worse for inhibitory potency than the addition of aspartate residue. Furthermore, we observed a slight but significant relationship in that acidic residues added to the carboxyl terminus represented more potent inhibitors than those containing acidic residues on the amino terminus, suggesting that these peptides may indeed favor an orientation in which the acidic residues bind to the positively charged area at the end of the acidic groove, i.e. in the same direction as l-peptides/substrates. Alternatively, because the difference between (d)-ldrrrrrr and (d)-rrrrrrdl (and the glutamic acid pair) is quite small, it could simply be because of their use of different registries for binding (see below). In summary, the addition of potentially “anchoring” acidic residues did not improve binding ability over the starting compound D6R amide; any change in overall charge did, however, diminish binding affinity. To determine how d-polyarginines bind to the furin substrate binding pocket, we tested modified D6R amide peptides in which each position was sequentially substituted by either alanine or lysine. Because the furin cleavage consensus sequence is RXR/KR (reviewed in Ref. 1Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), we expected to find D6R amide binding directly into the acidic groove in any position between the S6 and S3′ sites. However, as discussed below, the positional scanning library results did not support a specific positioning of D6R amide in the acidic substrate pocket. Positioning of the hexapeptide from S6 toward the S1 site (S6→ S1, see scheme in Fig. 2 showing theoretical positioning) was judged to be unlikely because lysine substitution in the (d)-rrrrrk peptide or alanine in the (d)-rrrrra peptide would then be located in the S1 site, which should lead to an unfavorably large increase in Ki (this site strictly requires arginine; Ref. 1Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 2, we observed only slightly increased Ki for these two peptides as compared with (d)-rrrrrr (D6R). S5→ S1′ positioning also appeared unlikely, because in this case the alanine within the peptide (d)-rrrarr would be located in the S2 site (also known to prefer arginine or lysine); therefore, this positioning would not be associated with the relatively low Ki we observed. The S4→ S2′ positioning of the hexapeptides was also judged unlikely, because the peptide (d)-rrrarr with alanine at the presumed S1 site should be a much worse inhibitor than D6R amide. However, we found that this peptide still exhibited a relatively good Ki. Moreover, the very large increase in Ki observed with the (d)-rrkrrr peptide (where lysine is placed in the well accepting S2 site) also should not have been obtained if the peptide is placed in the position S4→2′. In the above analysis we assumed that D6R amide is oriented similar to substrates. Because it is equally possible that the peptides bind in a reverse orientation (see above), we performed a similar analysis for the reverse orientation. This brought us to a similar conclusion, i.e. that no specific positioning is favored. Summarizing, from this experiment we conclude that the various polyarginine-containing peptides most likely do not always bind in the same orientation into the subpockets but may adopt various binding configurations depending on the specific peptide. Modeling Studies of d-Peptides into the Furin Substrate Binding Pocket—To obtain views of the possible modes of d-peptide binding, we modeled different d- and l-peptides into the active site cleft of furin (Fig. 1). Starting from the experimentally observed covalent binding of the tetrapeptide (l)-RVKR to the active site (10Henrich S. Cameron A. Bourenkov G.P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Lindberg I. Bode W. Than M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), we exchanged all residues with arginine residues, added a P6 and a P5 arginine residue at the amino terminus, and extended the carboxyl terminus by aspartic acid or glutamic acid at P1′ and leucine at P2′. Energy minimization of the resulting l-peptide complexes with MAIN and DISCOVER validated this methodology and clearly showed the location of the P5, P6, and P1′ and P2′ residues in the corresponding subsites (Fig. 1, A and B). The furin residues Arg-193, His-364, and Arg-197, located at the border of the S1′ pocket, provide (in strong contrast to the non-prime subsites) a positive electrostatic surface potential that should attract negatively charged side chains such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid, in agreement with the known substrate profile of furin. Whereas the P6-P1 residues remained mostly unchanged during refinement with DISCOVER, the prime-side residues moved slightly away from the surface, obviously because of unfavorable interference with the rigid furin structure (Fig. 1B). Modeling of the d-polyarginine peptides did not reveal a clearly preferred binding geometry. Upon direct binding, favorable inter-main chain hydrogen bonds remain possible, with most side chains, in particular those of the P1 and the P2 residues, requiring some rearrangement (Fig. 1C). Upon simple retro binding, all main and side chain atoms in principle can superimpose with the equivalent residues of the experimental l-peptide structure, resulting, however, in the loss of intermain chain hydrogen bonds and in bad contacts between the P1-carbonyl and the carbonyl-oxygen of Ser-253 (2.0 A), and the P3-carbonyl and the carbonyl-oxygen of Gly-255 (1.8 A; data not shown). We attempted to relieve these poor contacts by molecular mechanics calculations before (Fig. 1D) or after (Fig. 1E) manual flipping of the peptide bonds of the inhibitor. A comparison of these models with the initial l-peptide model (Fig. 1, thin, gray stick models) shows that the three d-peptide models exhibit reasonable binding geometries, with good intermolecular energies of the inhibitor and reasonable interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme surface. With the d-peptides, however, it is not possible to simultaneously satisfy all side and main chain interaction requirements available to the l-peptides. This is in agreement with our experimental results, described below, showing that poly-l-arginines exhibit a higher affinity than poly-d-arginines. Because of the many detailed differences observed, the energies resulting from energy minimization of the d-peptides are not directly comparable. We therefore conclude from our modeling studies that several binding geometries seem to be possible for d-peptides and that a ranking of these possibilities is not feasible. l- and d-Decapeptide Library Scanning—To identify a potent inhibitory decapeptide sequence, we screened positional scanning carboxyl-terminal-amidated l- and d-decapeptide libraries. The libraries were tested five times with various concentrations of substrate (from 100 to 200 μm pERTKR-MCA) of the inhibitory library (from 0.6 to 1 mg/ml) and of the enzyme (from 25 to 100 nm). In all cases, the pattern of inhibition was similar, showing differences only in the level of discrimination. In each experiment, we have calculated for each position the inhibitory contribution of a particular peptide mixture defined with an amino acid in comparison with other peptide mixtures (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mean values from five experiments, representing the percent contributions of the defined amino acid in overall inhibition for a given site, were calculated. Fig. 3 shows that basic residues are greatly preferred in almost all positions of both the d- and l-decapeptides. In three amino-terminal positions of the l-decapeptide library the most preferred residue is lysine (18, 27, 18%, respectively), just ahead of arginine (16, 18, 17%). Similarly in the fourth and fifth positions arginine (24 and 25%) and lysine (22 and 22%) were the most potent. In the sixth position of the l-decapeptide library threonine-containing peptides (19%) appeared to be slightly better inhibitors than those containing arginine (19%) or serine (13%). The most potent carboxyl terminus therefore favored the sequence: (l)-HRRH (28, 40, 42, and 37%). Library screening also revealed that glutamic acid and aspartic acid, but also other amino acids such as proline, tyrosine, tryptophan, and to a lesser extent alanine, cysteine, glutamine, asparagine, and glycine were not well accepted at any position. Methionine residues at the third, sixth, and tenth positions were much better tolerated than at other positions. Leucine, valine, and isoleucine residues appeared to be neutral with regard to effects on inhibitory potency. Scanning of the d-decapeptide library showed, however, a different and somewhat puzzling pattern of inhibitory potency. Arginine was the most inhibitory residue in almost every position but was most essential in the second and third positions. d-Lysine in positions 1–5 exhibited good inhibition, and (in contrast to the l-decapeptide library screening) was also acceptable in the eighth position. Interestingly, histidine was not inhibitory in any position. Also in contrast to the l-peptide library screening, the presence of glutamic acid in the seventh and ninth positions of the d-decapeptide library was moderately inhibitory. d-Decapeptides containing valine in the fourth position also exhibited substantial inhibition. Polyarginine Characterization—It has been previously shown that L9R, even though it can be cleaved by furin, was significantly more potent an inhibitor than both D6R amide and L6R (7Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the inhibitory potency of d-polyarginines of different lengths against human furin. d-Peptides were not cleaved by furin (data not shown). Similar to previous results obtained using l-peptides (7Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), an increase in chain length led to a decrease of Ki, yielding in the case of D9R amide the extremely low Ki of 1.3 nm ± 0.2 (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, carboxyl-terminal amidation lowered the Ki of D6R eight times below that of the unmodified form (Fig. 5). A detailed examination of the various unmodified and amidated forms of L6R and L9R supported the idea that carboxyl-terminal amidation decreases the inhibitory potency of l-peptides but increases it in the case of d-peptides. We also tested the inhibitory potency of other basic peptides. d-Hexalysine"

At the early stages of liver regeneration, TNF functions as a priming agent for hepatocyte replication and increases the sensitivity of hepatocytes to growth factors such as transforming growth factor α (TGFα); however, the mechanisms by which TNF interacts with growth factors and enhances hepatocyte replication are not known. Using the AML-12 hepatocyte cell line, we show that TNF stimulates proliferation of these cells through transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The transactivation mechanism involves the release of TGFα into the medium through activation of the metalloproteinase TNFα-converting enzyme (also known as ADAM 17). Binding of the ligand to EGFR initiates a mitogenic cascade through extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and the partial involvement of protein kinase B. TNF-induced release of TGFα and activation of EGFR signaling were inhibited by TNFα protease inhibitor-1, an agent that interferes with TNFα-converting enzyme activity. We suggest that TNF-induced transactivation of EGFR may provide an early signal for the entry of hepatocytes into the cell cycle and may integrate proliferative and survival pathways at the start of liver regeneration.

It binds to specific type 1 and type 2 receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), although TNFR1 is responsible for most of the biological effects of TNF. Binding of the ligand causes activation of the trimeric receptor and recruitment of adapter proteins that interact with specific domains of the receptor, most commonly the death domain (1Wallach D.

Specific TNF-induced responses require the association of different adapter proteins to the receptor. For example, the recruitment of adapter proteins such as TRADD and TRAF2 activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including the NFκB pathway, which can protect cells against apoptosis. In contrast, binding of the adapter protein FADD initiates a cascade of events that results in apoptosis. In the liver, signaling through TNFR1 induces cell survival, replication, or apoptosis, depending on the context (4Kirillova I. Chaisson M. Fausto N. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 819-828PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pierce R.H. Campbell J.S. Stephenson A.B. Franklin C.C. Chaisson M. Poot M. Kavanagh T.J. Rabinovitch P.S. Fausto N. Am. J.

A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and interferes with hepatic regeneration after acute chemical injury (8Yamada Y. Webber E.M. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N.

Pharmacol. 2003; 193: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also have shown that TNF functions as a priming agent that sensitizes hepatocytes to the effects of growth factors involved in liver regeneration. Furthermore, in normal liver, TNF synergistically enhances proliferation induced by growth factors TGFα and hepatocyte growth factor (10Webber E.M. Bruix J. Pierce R.H. Fausto N. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1226-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the proliferative activity of TNF have not been elucidated, although it has been proposed that TNF modulates hepatocyte proliferation through TGFα (11Gallucci R.M. Simeonova P.P. Toriumi W. Luster M.I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The activation of TNFR1 signaling after partial hepatectomy, sequential activation of NFκB and signal transducer and activator 3 transcription factors, and increased interleukin-6 levels is necessary for hepatocyte replication (7Yamada Y.

Nevertheless, the components of this pathway may act as cell survival factors and may not be directly involved in the triggering of hepatocyte replication (13Kovalovich K. Li W. DeAngelis R.

If this is the case, the involvement of TNF in hepatocyte replication requires the activation of additional pathways that are directly linked to cell proliferation. We show here that the proliferative effect of TNF in AML-12 hepatocytes requires transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Transactivation of EGFR by TNF is accomplished through the activity of TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE, also known as ADAM 17) a surface metalloproteinase that releases soluble TGFα from pro-TGFα anchored in the plasma membrane. Released TGFα binds to EGFR, activating a signaling cascade that leads to DNA replication.

All other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Buffers—The buffers used were Triton lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4), an assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), and an assay buffer plus ATP (100 μm cold ATP, 20 μCi/ml ATP). Cell Culture—AML-12 hepatocytes, a cell line established from hepatocytes of a TGFα transgenic mouse, were cultured as described previously (17Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, cultures were grown to 60–70% confluence and then serum-starved overnight in complete medium containing no fetal bovine serum. When inhibitors were used, cells were pretreated for 30 min prior to stimulation with the indicated concentration of inhibitor, which remained in the medium for the remainder of the experiment. The final concentration of Me2SO, the diluent for the inhibitors, was present in the culture medium at 0.1% or less. When using the TGFα neutralizing antibody, cultures were preincubated with 3 μg/ml antibody for 2 h prior to stimulation. Aliquots of TNF and TGFα used for stimulation were also preincubated with antibody (3 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—AML-12 cells were plated at 40,000 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates and allowed to grow overnight in 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, the cells were rinsed twice with Hanks' buffered saline solution, and complete medium containing no fetal bovine serum was added to the cells. The cells were stimulated the following day for 24 h unless otherwise noted. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/ml final concentration) was added to the medium for the final 3 h of stimulation. The trichloroacetic acid non-precipitable fraction was removed from the cells, and the precipitable fraction was solubilized in NaOH and quantified using a scintillation counter. Each treatment was measured in triplicate, and the data are represented as the average, with the error bars representing the mean ± S.E. BrdUrd Labeling—Cells were plated in 6- or 12-well plates, serum-starved, and stimulated as described previously in the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. For the last 3 h of stimulation, the cultures were incubated with BrdUrd labeling reagent at 1:1000 dilution. Cells were rinsed and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with acetic alcohol (90% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, 5% distilled H2O). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation in 1% H2O2 in methanol for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS and incubated in 1.5 n HCl at 37 °C for 15 min followed by extensive washing in PBS. Cells were then incubated in anti-BrdUrd antibody at 1:40 dilution in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C and washed in PBS. Cells were incubated in anti-mouse secondary antibody at 1:100 dilution in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature followed by washing. Cells were incubated in ABC solutions for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, for 5 min, and then the 3,3-diaminobenzidine solution was added. Three areas in each well were counted for a total of ∼1000 cells. Proliferation is indicated as a percentage of labeled nuclei. Transforming Growth Factor α Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Cells were cultured and stimulated according to [3H]thymidine incorporation protocol. Cell culture medium was collected 21 h after stimulation and frozen in aliquots at –80 °C until analysis. Human TGFα was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Preparation of Lysates—To harvest for whole cell protein after the indicated stimulation, cells in 10-cm plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping into 0.5 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Lysates were sonicated twice for 1–2 s on the lowest setting and then clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were frozen in aliquots at –80 °C. Western Blots—Western blots were performed following standard protocols. Briefly, lysates (20 μg) were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For anti-EGFR Western blots, 50 μg of lysate was resolved on low bisacrylamide (0.4%) gels (18Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that were transferred overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) containing 4% milk or bovine serum albumin (anti-phosphotyrosine blots) prior to incubation with primary antibodies. Membranes were then washed well with TBST, incubated with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase at 1:10,000, anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase at 1:5000) for 1 h, washed extensively in TBST, and developed with a chemiluminescent reagent. Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor Immunoprecipitation—AML-12 cells were harvested in Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing no reducing agent (β-mercaptoethanol). Lysate (250 μg) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of antibody and 20 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer. The beads were then boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and run on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes overnight at 4 °C and then immunoblotted as described previously. 32P Labeling and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—10-cm dishes of AML-12 cells were serum-starved overnight in DMEM/hi glucose medium containing the insulin:transferrin:selenium mixture, dexamethasone, and gentamicin. The medium was changed to phosphate-free DMEM/hi glucose, and 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each plate (5 ml). Cells were labeled for 6 h and then stimulated as indicated. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously. EGFR was immunoprecipitated overnight (500 μg of lysate, 2 μg of antibody, and protein A-Sepharose). Immunoprecipitates were run on SDS polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to film to visualize 32P incorporation into the receptor. The labeled bands were excised from the gel and quantified by Cerenkov counting. Protein was extracted from the gel and analyzed for phosphoamino acid as described previously (18Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For phosphoamino acid analysis, dried pellets were resuspended in 5 μl of distilled H2O. 1 μlof the phosphoserine, -threonine, and -tyrosine standard and 2 μl of sample were loaded onto the origin of a 10 × 10-cm cellulose TLC plate. First dimension separation was run in ethanol:glacial acetic acid:distilled H2O (1:1:1) for 90 min at room temperature. Second dimension separation was run in butanol:formic acid:distilled H2O (8:3:4, v/v/v) for 40 min. Plates were dried and sprayed with 0.5% ninhydrin in 0.5% acetone and heated to 80 °C for 5 min to visualize standards. Plates were then exposed to film for visualization of 32P incorporation. Induction of Cell Proliferation by Tumor Necrosis Factor—To study the effects of TNF on cell replication, AML-12 cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 24 h, a procedure that reduced DNA replication as determined by BrdUrd labeling to a basal level of less than 10%. Subconfluent serum-starved cells were exposed to 20 ng/ml TNF for 24–72 h (Fig. 1a). Cell labeling by BrdUrd increased to 53% at 24 h and progressively decreased to the same level as non-stimulated cultures by 72 h. In repeated experiments, TNF increased BrdUrd labeling by 2–5-fold at 24 h and also increased the cell number by 2.5-fold at 48 h (data not shown). AML-12 hepatocytes produce membrane-bound pro-TGFα (17Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, addition of TGFα to the culture medium enhances DNA replication (Fig. 1b). At the doses used, TGFα increased BrdUrd labeling between 5- and 10-fold 24 h after exposure and increased cell numbers at 48 h. These data indicate that the EGFR is not saturated with endogenous ligand and is receptive to additional ligand stimulation. Consistent with this notion, we found that EGF and HB-EGF also stimulate DNA replication in AML-12 cells at levels comparable with those obtained with TGFα. In contrast, interleukin-6 and oncostatin M had little to no effect (data not shown). Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced Cell Replication Requires Transforming Growth Factor α/Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor Signaling—We have previously shown that TNF functions as a mitogen for intrahepatic stem cells (oval cells) and for primary hepatocytes in serum-containing cultures but is without effect in serum-free cultures (4Kirillova I. Chaisson M. Fausto N. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 819-828PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that TNF functions as a complete mitogen for AML-12 hepatocytes maintained in serum-free medium indicated that in these cells a second proliferative signal may be generated by TNF. We hypothesized that signaling from TGFα and EGFR is necessary for TNF stimulation of cell replication. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of TNF to stimulate DNA synthesis in cultures in which signaling from both the ligand (TGFα) and its receptor (EGFR) was blocked. Serum-starved AML-12 cells were incubated with TGFα-neutralizing antibody or with the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 before stimulation with TNF or TGFα for 24 h (Fig. 2). As expected, the TGFα-neutralizing antibody almost entirely blocked the stimulation of DNA replication by exogenous TGFα and also decreased basal DNA synthesis by more than 60%. This indicates that TGFα is required for maintenance of the basal level of proliferation in these cells. Most important, exposure of the cells to the TGFα-neutralizing antibody prevented TNF-mediated DNA synthesis (Fig. 2a). The tyrphostin inhibitor AG1478 inhibits EGFR kinase activity in the low nanomolar range. Exposure of the cultured cells to this inhibitor reduced the basal level of DNA replication by 95%. AG1478 blocked the induction of DNA replication by either exogenously added TNF or TGFα (Fig. 2b). Taken together, the results of the experiments presented in Fig. 2 show that TNF-induced DNA replication requires TGFα and tyrosine kinase activity from EGFR. Tumor Necrosis Factor Stimulation Causes Phosphorylation of Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor—We next examined whether exposure to TNF causes phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 3). Whole cell lysates from cultures treated with either TNF or TGFα were immunoprecipitated with EGFR antibody and immunoblotted to detect phosphotyrosine. Fig. 3a shows that EGFR is phosphorylated on tyrosine in unstimulated AML-12 cells maintained in serum-free medium as determined by using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99. As expected, stimulation with TGFα caused increased phosphotyrosine reactivity. The addition of TNF did not cause a detectable increase in phosphotyrosine reactivity over the high basal signal, but it did cause an apparent shift in mobility, suggesting that the receptor might be modified by phosphorylation after TNF stimulation. To analyze the specific residues in the EGFR that may be phosphorylated after exposure to TNF or TGFα, we labeled serum-starved cells with [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were exposed to TNF or TGFα for 15 min and processed for phosphoamino acid analysis of EGFR. Both TGFα and TNF increased EGFR phosphorylation by 2–4-fold. EGFR protein was then extracted from the gel to determine which residues were phosphorylated after TNF and TGFα stimulation. Both agents caused an increase in serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor but did not appreciably enhance threonine phosphorylation (Fig. 3b). Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced DNA Replication Requires Downstream Signaling from Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor—The MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is activated by multiple tyrosine kinase receptors and is generally involved in cell proliferation. To test whether ERK1/2 is required for TNF-induced DNA replication in AML-12 cells, we inhibited the ERK1/2 pathway by blocking its upstream activator MEK1/2 with U0126 (Fig. 4a). This compound almost entirely blocked DNA replication induced by either TNF or TGFα. Growth factors and cytokines can also activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. To determine whether this pathway participates in TNF-induced DNA replication, we blocked PI3K with the specific inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 4b). DNA replication induced by either TNF or TGFα was blocked by this agent. Inhibition of ERK1/2 and PI3K in TNF-stimulated cells prevented the increase in DNA replication but did not affect cell survival. The MEK/ERK, PI3K, and NFκB pathways are all required for survival and/or proliferation after TNF exposure to AML-12 cells. To determine whether EGFR signaling is required for the activation of these pathways, we blocked EGFR kinase activity with AG1478 and assayed for phosphorylation of ERK1/2, PKB, and IκBα after TNF and TGFα stimulation. In preliminary experiments, we determined that the peak activation of ERK1/2, PKB, and IκBα occurred respectively at 15, 10, and 5 min after TNF exposure (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows that inhibition of EGFR activity during TNF stimulation completely blocked the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at Thr-202 and Tyr-204 (Fig. 5a), partially blocked phosphorylation of PKB at Ser-473 and Thr-308 (Fig. 5b), and had no effect on the phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 (Fig. 5c). AG1478 had similar effects on the activation of ERK1/2 and PKB by TGFα, but this growth factor failed to induce IκBα phosphorylation. We conclude that 1) activation of ERK1/2 by TNF is entirely dependent on EGFR signaling; 2) activation of PKB by TNF is only partially dependent on EGFR signaling; and 3) activation of IκBα by TNF does not involve EGFR signaling and takes place solely through TNF receptors. Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced Proliferation Requires Protease Activity—Although the experiments presented so far clearly indicate that TNF induces cell proliferation through the TGFα/EGFR signaling pathway, the mechanisms responsible for this effect have not yet been examined. One possibility is that there is intracellular cross-talk between TNF receptors and EGFR. The experiments with TGFα neutralizing antibody shown in Fig. 1, however, suggest that extracellular TGFα is required for the TNF effect. We therefore investigated whether EGFR could be transactivated by TNF in a manner analogous to the cross-talk between G-protein-coupled receptors and EGFR (19Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In this case, EGFR transactivation requires the cleavage of membrane-bound EGFR ligands by a metalloproteinase, with subsequent binding of the released factor to EGFR. We hypothesized that TNF-induced proliferation of AML-12 cells requires the activity of a metalloproteinase (MP) that cleaves membrane-bound TGFα. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether TNF caused the release of TGFα into the culture medium and whether MP inhibitors had an effect on TGFα release and DNA replication in cells exposed to TNF (Fig. 6). Exposure to TNF caused an ∼5-fold increase in the amounts of TGFα released in the culture medium (Fig. 6a). The broad specificity MP inhibitor GM6001 prevented this increase at concentrations of 10 and 50 μm, whereas an inactive form of GM6001 (negative control) had no effect (Fig. 6a). The inhibitor also blocked TNF-induced DNA replication by more than 50% (Fig. 6b) but had no effect on DNA synthesis induced by TGFα. This suggests that MPs act in TNF-mediated cell proliferation but do not participate in EGFR activation by exogenous TGFα. To determine what types of MPs may be involved in this process, we tested the effect of MP inhibitors with more defined specificity. TACE is a metalloproteinase disintegrin that cleaves proteins anchored in the cell membrane (20Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 21Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S.

TNF, TGFα, and other ligands of the EGF family can serve as substrates for this enzyme (22Lee D.C. Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Myers T.J. Stevenson M.Y. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). TAPI-1, a specific inhibitor of TACE, blocked TNF-induced DNA replication and the release of TGFα into the medium (Fig. 7, a and b). In marked contrast, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases 2, 3, 8, 9, and 13 had no effect on TNF-induced DNA replication (Fig. 7c).Fig. 7TACE activity is required for TNF-induced proliferation.a, serum-starved AML-12 cells were pretreated with Me2SO (Control), increasing concentrations of TAPI-1, or MMP-9/13 inhibitor for 30 min. Cells were then left untreated (Untx, hatched bars) or stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNF (filled bars). TAPI-1 concentrations were 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10, and 50 μm, and MMP-9/13 inhibitor concentration was 50 nm. Medium was collected from cultured AML-12 cells 21 h after treatment, and TGFα levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” b, serum-starved AML-12 cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of TAPI-1. Cells were then left untreated (squares) or treated with 20 ng/ml TNF (triangles) for 24 h. DNA replication was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” c, AML-12 cells were pretreated with either 0.1% Me2SO (Control) or the MMP inhibitors indicated. Cells were then left untreated (hatched bars) or stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNF (filled bars) for 24 h. MMP inhibitors were used at the following concentrations: MMP-2/9, 200 nm; MMP-9/13, 50 nm; MMP-3, 5 μm; and MMP-8, 100 nm (final). DNA replication was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next determined whether TACE blockage, shown to inhibit TNF-induced DNA replication, would interfere with EGFR signaling. Cells treated with TAPI-1 or Me2SO (as control) were stimulated with TNF or TGFα. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 8) showed that TAPI-1 completely blocked the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by TNF (Fig. 8a) and partially prevented the phosphorylation of PKB by TNF (Fig. 8b). The TACE inhibitor had no effect on ERK1/2 or PKB phosphorylation induced by exogenous TGFα. These experiments suggest that TNF stimulates cell proliferation in AML-12 hepatocytes through the activation of TACE, which cleaves membrane-bound TGFα. This ligand in turn binds to EGFR to initiate a mitogenic cascade that involves ERK1/2 and PKB. TNF induces multiple responses in the liver, including cytokine activation, cell death, and cell proliferation (24Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which TNF causes cytokine stimulation and apoptosis have been well studied, much less is known about the mechanisms by which TNF stimulates hepatocyte replication. Activation of NFκB and signal transducer and activator 3 and increases in interleukin-6 are associated with hepatocyte proliferation in the regenerating liver in vivo and in cell cultures, but it is still unresolved whether these agents function to maintain cell survival or are direct participants in signaling events that culminate in DNA replication. We have shown that TNF acts in conjunction with growth factors to stimulate hepatocyte replication (10Webber E.M. Bruix J. Pierce R.H. Fausto N. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1226-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on the following observations: 1) TNF injections cause little stimulation of hepatocyte replication in mouse liver; 2) in primary cell cultures, TNF stimulates hepatocyte DNA replication in serum-containing cultures but has little activity in cultures maintained in serum-free medium, suggesting that it is not a complete mitogen; and 3) a single injection of 10 μg of TNF enhances the proliferative activity of TGFα and hepatocyte growth factor in normal livers. To investigate the relationship between TNF and mitogenic growth factors for hepatocytes, we examined the proliferative effects of TNF on AML-12 cells, a differentiated, non-transformed hepatocyte cell line developed in this laboratory. These cells produce precursor TGFα, which is anchored in the cell membrane. We show that in these cells TNF stimulates DNA replication by causing release of TGFα into the culture medium through the metalloproteinase disintegrin TACE. TGFα then activates EGFR and multiple downstream intracellular signaling cascades that are required for DNA replication. The EGFR ligands TGFα and HB-EGF are synthesized as transmembrane precursor molecules (20Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Cleavage of these molecules by limited proteolysis releases soluble growth factors, a process known as ectodomain shedding (25Kheradmand F. Werb Z. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Moss M.L. Lambert M.H. Essays Biochem. 2002; 38: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The soluble factors cleaved from the precursor molecules bind to and activate EGFR signaling. Examples of this type of mechanism include HB-EGF-mediated EGFR transactivation by stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (27Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 28Kalmes A. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Physiol. 2001; 281: G111-G116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of EGFR signaling triggered by ligand binding are well described, much less is known about the source and generation of these ligands. Several lines of evidence suggest that the cell surface proteinases known as ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase), which contain a zinc-dependent catalytic domain, play an important role in ectodomain shedding of adhesion molecules and EGFR ligands (22Lee D.C. Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Myers T.J. Stevenson M.Y. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Chang A. Jackson L.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Hinkle C.L. Myers T.J. Stevenson M.Y. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Chang A. Jackson L.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In the work described here, we show that TACE activity is involved in TNF-induced TGFα shedding and EGFR transactivation in AML-12 hepatocytes. The TACE inhibitor TAPI-1 interferes with TGFα release into the culture medium and subsequent EGFR signaling through ERK1/2 and PKB, thereby blocking DNA replication. Cleavage of membrane proteins by TACE generally occurs at very low levels in unstimulated cells but is greatly enhanced by exposure of cells to various agents such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (35Doedens J.R. Mahimkar R.M. Black R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that in AML-12 hepatocytes TGFα is released into the culture medium after TNF treatment and that this release is blocked by TAPI-1, suggesting that TACE is activated by TNF. We do not know how TNF activates TACE, but our data suggest that ERK1/2 may not be involved in ligand shedding as has been proposed in other systems (22Lee D.C. Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L. Myers T.J. Stevenson M.Y. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Gerhart M.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Chang A. Jackson L.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 995: 22-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 36Zheng Y.

Transactivation of EGFR by TNF has been described in the human endometrium (37Chobotova K. Muchmore M.E. Carver J. Yoo H.J. Manek S. Gullick W.J. Barlow D.H. Mardon H.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

At another level of regulation, it has also been shown that in the liver TNF may enhance TGFα transcription (11Gallucci R.M. Simeonova P.P. Toriumi W. Luster M.I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results identify an important mode of interaction between cytokines and growth factors in hepatocytes. We suggest that in the regenerating liver, TNF provides the conditions for cell survival through NFκB activation and also triggers an initial stage for cell replication that involves the rapid transactivation of EGFR through metalloproteinase-mediated ligand release. At later times during liver regeneration, sustained production of these ligands is mediated by transcriptional mechanisms (24Fausto N. J.

To investigate the metabolic adaptations in response to the constitutive lipolysis, we studied perilipin-null (plin–/–) mice in terms of their fatty acid oxidation and glycerol and glucose metabolism homeostasis by using dynamic biochemical testing and clamp and tracer infusion methods. plin–/– mice showed increased β-oxidation in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue resulting from a coordinated regulation of the enzymes and proteins involved in β-oxidation. The increased β-oxidation helped remove the extra free fatty acids created by the constitutive lipolysis. An increase in the expression of the transcripts for uncoupling proteins-2 and -3 also accompanied this increase in fatty acid oxidation. Adult plin–/– mice had normal plasma glucose but a reduced basal hepatic glucose production (46% that of plin+/+). Insulin infusion during low dose hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp further lowered the glucose production in plin–/– mice, but plin–/– mice also showed a 36% decrease (p < 0.007) in glucose disposal rate during the low dose insulin clamp, indicating peripheral insulin resistance. However, compared with plin+/+ mice, 14-week-old plin–/– mice showed no significant difference in glucose disposal rate during the high dose hyperinsulinemic clamp, whereas 42-week-old plin–/– mice displayed significant insulin resistance on high dose hyperinsulinemic clamp. Despite increasing insulin resistance with age, plin–/– mice at different ages maintained a normal glucose response during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance curve, being compensated by the increased β-oxidation and reduced hepatic glucose production. These experiments uncover the metabolic adaptations associated with the constitutional lipolysis in plin–/– mice that allowed the mice to continue to exhibit normal glucose tolerance in the presence of peripheral insulin resistance.

Obesity is a growing health problem with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Although obesity can result from environmental factors and a sedentary life-style, recent findings suggest that susceptibility to obesity is to a large extent genetically determined (1Barsh G.S. Farooqi I.S. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 2000; 404: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). One approach to study obesity and its associated morbidity is to investigate genes and pathways involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and body fat deposition. A fat cell protein, perilipin, has recently been found to play a key role in determining body habitus as its absence leads to a lean and obesity-resistant phenotype in mice (2Martinez-Botas J.

Perilipin belongs to a class of proteins found exclusively at the limiting surface of storage droplets in adipocytes and in steroidogenic cells (4Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B.

It coats the lipid droplets and protects triglycerides from the lipolytic action of hormone-sensitive lipase (6Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Hormone-sensitive lipase catalyzes the breakdown of triacylglycerols and the release of free fatty acids and glycerol from adipose tissue to the circulation (8Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The amount of hormone-sensitive lipase expressed in perilipin-null (plin–/–) mice appeared to be normal (2Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H.J. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.-H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence indicates that lipolysis is under the control of protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of perilipin in response to different lipolytic agents (9Souza S.C.

Observations in plin–/– mice indicate that the absence of this lipid droplet protein is associated with a marked reduction in stored adipose mass, normal body weight despite increased food intake, increased muscle mass, and resistance to diet-induced and genetic obesity (2Martinez-Botas J.

A. 2001; 98: 6494-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). plin–/– mice have increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption and constitutively activated basal lipolysis but attenuated stimulated lipolytic activity. We hypothesized that with the constitutively active lipolysis, there would be a compensatory increase in utilization of the released free fatty acids by increased tissue β-oxidation and that this would result in a switch from glucose utilization to fatty acid utilization for energy needs. This switch could then affect glucose tolerance in these mice and may underlie some of the reported glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia in plin–/– mice (3Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.-X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6494-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we studied the metabolism of plin–/– mice with special attention to the lipid and glucose handling in the liver and skeletal muscle by using tracer and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp techniques. Animals—plin–/– mice in C57BL/6J background at F6–F8 generation were generated and genotyped as described previously (2Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H.J. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.-H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). plin–/– and plin+/+ mice, weighing 18–26 g, were used in this study unless otherwise mentioned. Wild-type (plin+/+) and homozygous knockout mice (plin–/–) were housed and bred in a pathogen-free barrier facility (Baylor College of Medicine). Animals were housed under controlled temperature and lighting (22–24 °C; 12-h light-dark cycle) with free access to food and water. All experiments were done following approval of the protocol by the animal care research committee of the Baylor College of Medicine. Glucose Tolerance Test and Insulin Tolerance Test—We performed intraperitoneal (IP) 1The abbreviations used are: IP, intraperitoneal; ITT, insulin tolerance test; GTT, glucose tolerance test; GCMS, gas chromatographymass spectrometry; WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; GPR, glucose production rate. insulin tolerance test (ITT) and IP glucose tolerance test (GTT) at 8, 14, 28, and 42 weeks for male mice (weighing 20–26 g) and at 8, 14, 26, and 38 weeks for female mice (weighing 18–22 g). For GTT, we injected intraperitoneally 1.5 g of glucose/kg following a 12-h fast as described (2Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H.J. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.-H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 11Chang B. Liao W. Li L. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6051-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For ITT, we administered an intraperitoneal injection of regular insulin (1 unit/kg body weight) (Humulin R) to mice after an overnight fast. We measured blood glucose levels at different time points by using a glucometer (Life Scan, Milpitas, CA). Insulin and Lactate Measurement—We measured insulin levels by using a mouse enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Crystal Chemical, Chicago, and circulating lactate by using a kit from Sigma following the manufacturers' instructions. Pyruvate Tolerance Test—Overnight fasted (16 h) mice were injected IP with pyruvate (2 g/kg), and the glucose level was measured before and after injection at different time points (12Miyake K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Nakamura T. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). β-Oxidation of Soleus Muscle, Adipocytes, and Liver Homogenate—We isolated soleus muscle from the hind limb of 4-h fasted mice. We cleaned and weighed it and measured β-oxidation as described by Alam and Saggerson (13Alam N. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, each soleus muscle strip was incubated with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37 °C containing 4% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin complexed with [14C]palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Reaction was stopped with 60% perchloric acid, and the released CO2 was trapped by hyamine hydroxide at the top of a hanging center well, and the radioactivity in CO2 was measured by a β-scintillation counter. We added epinephrine (1 μg/ml) in some samples to maximally stimulate β-oxidation. To measure β-oxidation in adipose tissue, we isolated adipocytes from epididymal fat pads as described (14Hong R. Zarnowski M.J. Cushman S.W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47585-47593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fat pads were removed, minced, and digested with collagenase at 37 °C for 2 h. The primary adipocytes were then washed extensively and used for β-oxidation measurements in the absence and presence of insulin (1 μm). The rate of oxidation per cell was calculated from the DNA content of the isolated adipocytes. β-Oxidation in liver homogenate was measured as described previously (15Ma K. Cabrero A. Saha P.K. Kojima H. Li L. Chang B.H.-J. Paul A. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34658-34661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In brief, 10% liver homogenate was prepared in ice-cold homogenization buffer and filtered through a 70-μm nylon membrane. We incubated the homogenate in incubation buffer containing carnitine, NAD, ATP, cytochrome c, MgCl2, coenzyme A, and [14C]palmitic acid complexed with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 1 h, trapped the CO2 released, and quantified the radioactivity as described above. In some samples antimycin A (5 mm) and rotenone (1 mm) were used to inhibit completely the β-oxidation in the homogenate. Adipokine Measurements—We measured plasma leptin by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Quantikine M, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and resistin by using a radioimmunoassay kit from Linco Research Immunoassay (St. Charles, MO). Relative plasma adiponectin concentration was determined by Western blotting by using an antibody against an adiponectin C-terminal 138-amino acid fragment (15Ma K. Cabrero A. Saha P.K. Kojima H. Li L. Chang B.H.-J. Paul A. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34658-34661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). cDNA Probes—The cDNA probes were prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of mouse RNA and cloning into TA vector. All probes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Northern Blotting of RNA—We isolated total RNA from snap-frozen tissue samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (16Jones J.P. Dohm G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E682-E687PubMed Google Scholar), and we performed the Northern blots as described previously (11Chang B. Liao W. Li L. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6051-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H.J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, we fractionated the total RNA (20 μg/sample) on a 1.2% agarose, 2 m formaldehyde gel and electrotransferred it to a Hybond N1 membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following UV cross-linking, the filters were prehybridized for 60 min at 42 °C in QuickHyb (Ambion, Austin, TX) and then hybridized overnight at 42 °C in QuickHyb buffer with randomly primed [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes for different enzymes and proteins and normalized with 28 S RNA. Northern blots were visualized with a Cyclone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To quantify the level of expression of most of the transcripts, we sacrificed three or more mice per group, isolated RNA from each tissue separately, and analyzed them separately. For analysis of ACC1 and ACC2, we prepared poly(A) RNA by using a poly(A) kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) from RNA pooled from groups of 3–4 mice per group, and analysis was performed on three different pooled samples. Expression level was quantified by densitometric scanning. Difference was taken as significant if p ≤ 0.05 using Student's t test (paired and unpaired). Isotope Tracers—We used the tracers [6,6-2H2]glucose (isotopic purity, 99 atom %) and [2-13C]glycerol (isotopic purity 99 atom %) purchased from Cambridge Laboratories. We dissolved them in normal saline solution and sterilized them by filtration just before use. Metabolic Studies Using Stable Isotopes—We anesthetized mice with avertin and exposed the right jugular vein via a midline neck incision. We inserted a microcannula into the jugular vein, threaded it to the right atrium, and anchored it with silk sutures at the venotomy site. The free end of the cannula was tunneled subcutaneously to the top of the head, where it was exteriorized through a skin incision. The mice were allowed to recover for 4 days with normal access to food and water. After an overnight fast, the awake, unstressed, and chronically catheterized mice received a primed (150 μmol/kg) constant rate infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose and [2-13C]glycerol (2.5 μmol/kg/min) aiming at an isotopic enrichment of 1–5% for 5 h. We collected blood via tail vein before infusion and at hourly intervals during infusion, immediately separating and freezing the plasma for analysis later. Sample Preparation—We used cold acetone to treat the plasma sample to precipitate the protein. We prepared the penta-acetate derivative of glucose and triacetate derivative of glycerol using pyridine and acetic anhydride (18Sunehag A. Ewald U. Gustafsson J. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 36: 550-557Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Fjeld C.R. Cole F.S. Bier D.M. Pediatr. Res. 1992; 32: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Isotopic enrichments were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described in detail below. High Dose and Low Dose Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp Studies—We anesthetized and cannulated the mice as described above. Animals were allowed to recover for 3–4 days. We then administered to overnight-fasted, conscious mice a primed infusion (10 μCi) and then a constant rate intravenous infusion (0.1 μCi/min) of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified [3-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using a syringe infusion pump (KD Scientific). For determination of basal glucose production, we collected blood samples from the tail vein after 50, 55, and 60 min of labeled glucose infusion. After 60 min, mice were primed with regular insulin (bolus 40 milliunits/kg body weight) followed by a 2-h insulin infusion (3 milliunits/kg/min). Simultaneously, we infused 10% glucose using another infusion pump at a rate adjusted to maintain the blood glucose level at 100–140 mg/dl (low dose hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp). Blood glucose concentration was determined every 10 min by a glucometer (LifeScan, NJ). At the end of a 120-min period, we collected blood (100, 110, and 120 min) to measure the hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose disposal rates (20Kim J.K. Gavrilova O. Chen Y. Reitman M.L. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8456-8460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 21Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A high dose hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was then started using 10 milliunits/kg/min insulin infusion and continued for 120 min to measure in vivo glucose utilization according to the method of Fujita et al. (22Fujita Y. Kojima H. Hidaka H. Fujimiya M. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with slight modification. We monitored the plasma glucose level every 3 min. At the end of the 120 min, we collected blood to measure the glucose disposal rate (20Kim J.K. Gavrilova O. Chen Y. Reitman M.L. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8456-8460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 21Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and calculated the total body glucose infusion rate. Analytical Methods—Plasma was separated and deproteinized using equal volumes of barium hydroxide and zinc sulfate, dried to remove 3H2O, resuspended in water, and counted in scintillation fluid using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). We determined insulin concentrations by using a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago) and plasma glucose by GPO trinder kit (Sigma). We calculated whole body glucose and basal glucose production (mg/kg/min) by dividing the [3-3H]glucose infusion rate by the plasma glucose-specific activity corrected to the body weight. During the clamp, hepatic glucose production was calculated as the difference between the tracer-derived rate of glucose appearance and the infusion rate of glucose. GCMS Measurements—Isotopic enrichments of [6,6-2H2]glucose and [2-13C]glycerol were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) using an HP5890 (GC)/5989B (MS) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The GC column used was medium polar SPB 17, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). The positive chemical ionization mode with methane as reaction gas was applied with selective monitoring of m/z 159 corresponding to unlabeled glycerol, m/z 160 representing the [2-13C]glycerol. For glucose, the same ionization mode was used with selected monitoring of m/z 331–333, reflecting unlabeled glucose (m/z 331), single labeled glucose derived from [2-13C]glycerol (m/z 332), and double labeled glucose derived from [6,6-2H2]glucose (m/z 333) (23Sunehag A.L. Haymond M.W. Schanler R.J. Reeds P.J. Bier D.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To correct for possible errors in the GCMS measures, we prepared two different standard curves that were analyzed with the samples. These standard curves were prepared by mixing unlabeled glucose and glycerol, respectively, with [6,6-2H2]glucose (mole ratio 0–6%) and [2-13C]glycerol (mole ratio 0–20%), respectively. Calculations for Tracer Studies—Total plasma glucose appearance rates were calculated from 6,6-2H2 enrichment of glucose during steady states using established isotope dilution Equation 1 (24Bier D.M. Sherman W.R. Holland W.H. Holmes W.F. Kipnis D.M. Diabetes. 1996; 26: 1005-1015Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Bougneres P.F. Biol. Neonate. 1987; 2: 87-96Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar),total plasma glucose Ra=(Ei/Ep)×I (Eq. 1) where Ei is the [6,6-2H2]glucose enrichment of the infusate; Ep is the [6,6-2H2]glucose enrichment in plasma; I is the infusion rate of [6,6-2H2]glucose (μmol/kg/min), and glucose Ra is the glucose appearance rate. Under steady state conditions, glucose appearance rate = glucose disappearance (utilization) rate (Equation 2).GPR=total glucose Ra−exogenous glucose (labeled and unlabeled)(Eq. 2) Total glycerol Ra was calculated as shown in Equation 3,(Ei/Ep)×I(Eq. 3) where Ei is the isotopic enrichment of the [2-13C]glycerol tracer; Ep is the isotopic enrichment of [2-13C]glycerol in plasma; and I is the infusion rate of the [2-13C]glycerol tracer. Endogenous glycerol Ra, i.e. total glycerol Ra – exogenous glycerol (in this case the infusion rate of the [2-13C]glycerol tracer) is an indicator of lipolysis. In addition, the fraction of glucose derived from glycerol was calculated from the 13C-enrichment in plasma glucose reflected by m/z 332/331 as described by Bougneres et al. (26Bougneres P.F. Hillman L.S. Bier D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), Patel and Kalhan (27Patel D. Kalhan S. Pediatr. Res. 1992; 31: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and Sunehag et al. (18Sunehag A. Ewald U. Gustafsson J. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 36: 550-557Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) as shown in Equations 4 and 5,glycerol flux to glucose =(13C enrichment in glucose / 13C enrichment in glycerol)× glucose Ra(Eq. 4) % of GPR from glycerol=100(Glycerol flux/GPR)×1/2(Eq. 5) The reason for multiplication by ½ is that glucose is a 6-carbon unit, whereas glycerol is a 3-carbon unit. The fraction of glycerol Ra converted to glucose = glycerol flux/glycerol Ra. Glucose Uptake by Isolated Soleus Muscles—We measured glucose uptake in isolated soleus muscle as described (28Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) with little modification. Briefly, we isolated soleus from overnight fasted mice and first incubated it for 1 h at 37 °C in KRB buffer (NaCl (118.5 mm), KCl (4.7 mm), CaCl2 (2.4 mm), MgCl2 (3.1 mm), NaHCO3 (25 mm), and NaH2PO4 (2 mm)) supplemented with 8 mm glucose or 2-deoxyglucose, 8 mm mannitol, and 0.1% albumin. All buffers were continuously gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. At the end of preincubation, we transferred the muscle to fresh KRB containing 8 mm glucose and 0 or 1000 microunits/ml insulin and continued incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. The muscle was then rinsed in KRB containing 16 mm mannitol at 30 °C for 10 min. We then measured glucose uptake in 2 ml of KRB containing 8 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 2 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose and 8 mm d-mannitol with 0.3 μCi/ml d-[14C]mannitol in the presence of insulin (0 or 1000 microunits/ml) at 30 °C for 15 min. The muscle was then blotted on filter paper and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was performed as described (29Ihlemann J. Ploug T. Hellsten Y. Galbo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E208-E214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). plin–/– mice are lean due to constitutional lipolysis. However, their plasma-free fatty acid level is not significantly different from that of wild-type littermates (2Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H.J. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.-H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), which suggests that the free fatty acids produced must be utilized at an accelerated rate in plin–/– mice compared with plin+/+ controls. To test this hypothesis, we measured various parameters related to β-oxidation in the skeletal muscle, adipocyte and liver of these mice. Increased β-Oxidation in Isolated Soleus Muscle, Adipocyte and Liver Homogenates of plin–/–Mice—We measured the rate of β-oxidation in isolated soleus muscle (predominantly composed of oxidative red fibers) and found that it was 30% higher (p < 0.001) in plin–/– mice compared with plin+/+ littermates (Fig. 1a). There was no difference in the rate of β-oxidation between plin–/– and plin+/+ mice when the soleus muscle was maximally stimulated by incubation with a catecholamine (epinephrine). These findings indicate that the constitutively increased basal lipolysis in plin–/– mice (2Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H.J. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.-H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) is associated with an increase in fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle in the basal state. In addition to the soleus muscle, plin–/– mice also show a similar adaptative change in the liver. When we measured the rate of β-oxidation of liver homogenates, we found it to be ∼60% higher in plin–/– mice (p < 0.02) compared with that of plin+/+ controls (Fig. 1b). We next measured the rate of β-oxidation of the liver homogenate in the presence of rotenone and antimycin, inhibitors of complex I and complex III of the electron transport chain, respectively. We found a complete inhibition of β-oxidation of liver homogenates isolated from plin–/– and plin+/+ mice in the presence of these inhibitors, indicating that although the plin–/– mice exhibit an increased basal β-oxidation, the process was still under the control of the electron transport chain as it exists in wild-type mice. We also measured β-oxidation in isolated adipocytes from epididymal white fat. We found a 75% higher rate of β-oxidation per adipocyte isolated from plin–/– mice compared with wild-type mice (p < 0.0002) (Fig. 1c). As expected, insulin inhibited the rate of β-oxidation in both plin–/– and wild-type mice, but more so in the plin–/– group. Increased Expression of Oxidation Enzyme-related Genes in plin–/–Mice—To examine the mechanism of the increased β-oxidation in plin–/– mice, we studied the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in β-oxidation and its regulation. The rate-limiting step in the β-oxidation of fatty acids is the entry of fatty acyl-CoA into the mitochondria via the carnitine acyltransferase/translocase shuttle located in the mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) is a major enzyme involved in this transport. In plin–/– mice expression of CPT-1 transcript is markedly and significantly up-regulated in white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), and liver and tended to be higher in skeletal muscle and heart (Fig. 2a). The key allosteric inhibitor of CPT-1 activity is malonyl-CoA, which is synthesized from acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC). ACC2 mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated in WAT, BAT, liver and skeletal muscle, and ACC1 mRNA, in WAT, BAT, and skeletal muscle of plin–/– mice (Fig. 2a). This down-regulation would be expected to result in a decrease in malonyl-CoA, relieving the inhibition of the rate-limiting transport of fatty acyl-CoA into the"

Here, we show that cancer cells (PSK-1) derived from a patient with Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY) showing loss of an inactive X chromosome subsequently gained active X chromosomes. We found that this abnormal X chromosome composition in PSK-1 is caused by a loss of an inactive X chromosome followed by multiplication of identical active X chromosomes, not by reactivation of an inactive X chromosome. Furthermore, we extended the characterization of loss-of-inactive X in a series of 22 female-derived cancer cell lines (eight breast cancer cell lines, seven ovarian cancer cell lines, and seven cervical cancer cell lines). The data demonstrate that loss-of-inactive X in the female-derived cancer cells is mainly achieved by loss of an inactive X chromosomes followed by multiplication of an identical active X chromosomes. However, distinctive pathways, including reactivation of an inactive X chromosome, are also involved in the mechanisms for loss-of-inactive X and gain-of-active X in female-derived cancer cells. The biological significance of the loss-of-inactive X and gain-of-active X in the oncogenesis of Klinefelter syndrome and female-derived cancer cells are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2029934390,"Replication protein A (RPA) is a heterotrimeric, single-stranded DNA-binding complex comprised of 70-kDa (RPA1), 32-kDa (RPA2), and 14-kDa (RPA3) subunits that is essential for DNA replication, recombination, and repair in eukaryotes. In addition, recent studies using vertebrate model systems have suggested an important role for RPA in the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints following exposure to DNA replication stress. Specifically, RPA has been implicated in the recruitment and activation of the ATM-Rad3-related protein kinase, ATR, which in conjunction with the related kinase, ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated), transmits checkpoint signals via the phosphorylation of downstream effectors. In this report, we have explored the effects of RPA insufficiency on DNA replication, cell survival, and ATM/ATR-dependent signal transduction in response to genotoxic stress. RNA interference-mediated suppression of RPA1 caused a slowing of S phase progression, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in HeLa cells. RPA-deficient cells demonstrated high levels of spontaneous DNA damage and constitutive activation of ATM, which was responsible for the terminal G2/M arrest phenotype. Surprisingly, we found that neither RPA1 nor RPA2 were essential for the hydroxyurea- or UV-induced phosphorylation of the ATR substrates CHK1 and CREB (cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein). These findings reveal that RPA is required for genomic stability and suggest that activation of ATR can occur through RPA-independent pathways.

Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). RPA represents the major cellular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding activity in eukaryotic cells and coats ssDNA filaments stoichiometrically in vitro (1Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Through its binding and stabilization of ssDNA, RPA facilitates the unwinding and destabilization of double-stranded DNA, which represents a critical step during DNA replication, recombination, and repair. The major DNA binding activity of RPA resides within the 70-kDa RPA1 subunit, which contains a centrally positioned, high affinity, bipartite DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a low affinity carboxyl-terminal DBD (1Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The RPA2 protein also contains a DBD as well as a phosphorylation site-rich amino terminus that may regulate RPA activity in response to cell cycle phase transitions and DNA damage. Kinases implicated in the phosphorylation of RPA2 include cyclin-dependent kinases, and members of the PI 3-kinase-related kinase superfamily, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), and ATM/Rad3-related (ATR) (3Liu V.F.

However, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of RPA2 correlates with decreased binding of RPA to p53 (12Abramova N.A. Russell J. Botchan M. Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to its role in the maintenance and processing of ssDNA, RPA has been implicated as a regulator of DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints. Hypomorphic mutations in RPA1 are associated with hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and cell cycle checkpoint defects in budding and fission yeasts (14Parker A.E. Clyne R.K. Carr A.M.

Immunodepletion of RPA from Xenopus oocytes abrogates an aphidicolin-induced DNA replication checkpoint, which functions to suppress mitosis in the presence of incompletely replicated DNA (16You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Using the Xenopus system it was also shown that RPA is required for the suppression of DNA synthesis in response to DNA strand breaks (17Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The requirement of RPA for checkpoint activation in Xenopus extracts mirrors that for ATR (17Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), implying a functional interaction between these two proteins during the initiation of checkpoint signals. Consistent with this notion, RPA is required for the association of ATR with chromatin in the Xenopus system, suggesting that RPA recruits ATR, either directly or indirectly, to sites of genetic damage (16You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

Mammalian RPA was found to promote the chromatin association of ATR in vitro via the ATR-interacting protein, ATRIP (21Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in that study it was concluded that RPA is required for the ATR-mediated phosphorylation of its effector kinase, CHK1, after exposure to hydroxyurea or UV light. However, ATR also contains an intrinsic, RPA-independent, DNA binding activity (21Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar, 22Unsal-Kacmaz K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13346-13353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the quantitative requirement of RPA for ATR activation in vivo has not been established. In addition, although RPA has been extensively studied in vitro, the cellular consequences of RPA functional deficiency have yet to be explored in mammalian cells. In this report we have explored the genetic requirement of RPA for DNA replication, survival, and cell cycle checkpoint function in human cells. We demonstrate that RPA deficiency causes spontaneous DNA damage, apoptosis, and the induction of an ATM-dependent G2/M checkpoint. Surprisingly, we found that neither the RPA1 nor RPA2 subunits were absolutely required for ATR-dependent substrate phosphorylation in DNA-damaged HEK 293T cells. Our findings demonstrate a requirement for RPA in the maintenance of genomic integrity and suggest that ATR can be activated independently of RPA in response to genotoxic stress. Cell Culture and Antisera—HEK 293T and HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% FCS. Antibody suppliers included: GeneTex (α-ATM), Oncogene Research (α-RPA1, α-RPA2, and α-BrdUrd), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (α-CHK1 (G-4)), Upstate Biotechnology (α-tubulin and α-pH2AX-139), Cell Signaling (α-CREB), Affinity Bioreagents (α-ATR), and R&D Systems (α-pATM-1981 and α-pCHK1–317). The α-pCREB-121 antibody has been published previously (24Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S.L. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transfections and Protein Analysis—Transfection-ready small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon Research. siRNAs used in this study included: RPA1 (5′-AACUGGUUGACGAAAGUGGUG-3′), ATR (5′-AACCCGCGUUGGCGUGGUUGA-3′), RPA2, and ATM. The RPA2 and ATM siRNAs represented mixtures of four distinct RNA duplexes (SmartPool, Dharmacon). Three micrograms of siRNA was used for each transfection using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation procedure. Cells were harvested 48–72 h later and extracts prepared as described (24Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S.L. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Seventy-five μg of total protein was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% dried milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. After washing, the blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and developed using SuperSignal chemilumiscent substrate (Pierce). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For the phospho-H2AX analysis, HeLa cells were transfected with scrambled control (SCR) or RPA1 siRNAs and fixed 72 h later in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized in PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) for 10 min, washed once with PBS, and blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 3% BSA and 2% goat serum. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml α-phospho-H2AX antibody diluted in blocking solution. The cells were washed three times in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.4 μg/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Caltag). The cells were washed twice with PBS-T, once in PBS, and mounted using Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). A Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscrope was used to visualize all samples. Cell Cycle Analysis and Viability Assays—DNA synthesis was measured using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay. HeLa cells were transfected with SCR or RPA1 siRNAs and then pulse-labeled 48 h later with 10 μm BrdUrd for 30 min. The cells were then cultured in BrdUrd-free medium and harvested at 4-h intervals over a 24-h period. Following fixation with ice-cold 70% ethanol, the cells were processed for immunostaining with α-BrdUrd as described (25Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were subsequently stained with propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed by two-parameter flow cytometry. Profiles of the BrdUrd- and PI-stained populations were plotted using the WinMDI shareware package (Stanford University). Cell viability was directly measured via trypan blue uptake. Following trypsinization, cells were diluted 1:1 in trypan blue solution (Sigma) and examined under a microscope using a hemacytometer. For each treatment, 200 total cells were scored for trypan blue uptake, and the percent viability was calculated by dividing the number of trypan blue-positive cells by the total cell number. Phenotypic Characterization of RPA1-deficient Cells—We used an RPA1-specific siRNA to suppress RPA1 expression in HEK 293T or HeLa cells. Immunoblotting confirmed that the expression of RPA1 was reduced by more than 90% in both cell lines within 48 h of transfection, whereas the expression of RPA2 was unaffected (Fig. 1A). Transfection of a scrambled (SCR) siRNA had no effect on RPA1 expression. To examine the impact of RPA1 dosage suppression on DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, we transfected HeLa cells with SCR or RPA1 siRNAs and then pulse-labeled the cells 48 h later with BrdUrd for 30 min. The cells were then incubated in BrdUrd-free medium and harvested at 4-h intervals for staining with α-BrdUrd and PI. FACS analysis of the stained cell populations revealed that RPA1-deficient cells incorporated BrdUrd at a reduced level in comparison with the control cells (Fig. 1B, zero time point). In addition to an acute DNA synthesis defect, RPA1-deficient cells also displayed abnormal S phase progression. By 8 h after BrdUrd pulse labeling, virtually all of the control cells accumulated 4 n DNA content, indicating the completion of S phase. In contrast, 60% of RPA1-deficient cells displayed a DNA content intermediate between 2 and 4 n at this time point. By 16 h post-labeling, the difference between the control and RPA1-deficient cell populations was even more pronounced. At this time point, 79% of the BrdUrd-positive control cells, but only 7% of RPA1-deficient cells, had completed mitosis and re-entered G1 phase. The majority of the RPA1-deficient cells retained a 4 n DNA content 16 h after BrdUrd pulse labeling, suggesting that the cells had arrested in G2/M phase. The G2/M arrest profile of RPA1-deficient HeLa cells was further examined over a 96-h time frame. HeLa cells were transfected with SCR or RPA1 siRNAs and then stained with PI either 48 or 96 h later to measure DNA content by flow cytometry. The cell cycle profiles of HeLa cells transfected with SCR or RPA1 siRNAs were comparable at 48 h post-transfection. However, by 96 h post-transfection, the RPA1-deficient cells displayed a robust G2/M arrest phenotype (Fig. 1C). In addition, a substantial fraction (60–70%) of the cells detached from the tissue culture dish and underwent apoptosis, as assessed by trypan blue staining and morphologic analysis (Fig. 1D). The remaining attached cells exhibited an abnormal, elongated morphology, possibly indicative of terminal G2/M arrest (see supplemental Fig. 1). In sum, we find that RPA1 functional deficiency causes a slowing of S phase, terminal G2/M arrest, and apoptosis in HeLa cells. RPA1 Deficiency Causes Spontaneous DNA Damage and Activates ATM—Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that insufficient levels of RPA1 resulted in the generation of unrepaired DNA damage during S phase, with subsequent activation of a G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. To test this hypothesis we first examined whether RPA1-deficient cells displayed increased levels of DNA damage. HeLa cells were transfected with SCR or RPA1 siRNAs and stained 72 h later with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated histone γ-H2AX, a specific marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (26Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). Control cells displayed only weak phospho-H2AX immunoreactivity, with less than 5% of cells displaying brightly stained phospho-H2AX nuclear foci that are characteristic of cells containing DSBs (Fig. 2A and data not shown). In contrast, 70% of RPA1 siRNA-transfected HeLa cells displayed intense phospho-H2AX staining (Fig. 2A). As noted above, the RPA1-deficient cells were also morphologically distinct from the controls, with most of the cells displaying an elongated nucleus. From these findings we conclude that RPA1 deficiency causes spontaneous DNA damage, which activates a terminal G2/M checkpoint in HeLa cells. It is well established that ATM is required for optimal G2/M checkpoint induction in response to IR and other agents that induce DSBs (27Beamish H. Williams R. Chen P. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20486-20493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Xu B. Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the G2/M arrest observed in RPA1-deficient HeLa cells was ATM-dependent, we transfected HeLa cells with RPA1 and ATM siRNAs and then examined the cell cycle profiles by PI staining 72 h later. Consistent with the earlier experiments, transfection of RPA1 siRNA alone caused a pronounced G2/M arrest, whereas transfection of an ATM siRNA did not substantially affect the HeLa cell cycle (Fig. 2B). Cells that were co-transfected with RPA1 and ATM siRNAs displayed an attenuated G2/M arrest phenotype relative to cells that were transfected with RPA1 siRNA alone (Fig. 2B), even though the RPA1 expression levels were comparably reduced in both cell populations (data not shown). This finding indicates that ATM contributes to the G2/M arrest observed in RPA1-deficient cells. However, the finding that the G2/M arrest was not completely abolished suggests that ATM-independent mechanisms may also contribute to checkpoint activation in response to RPA functional insufficiency. The above finding implied that ATM is activated as a consequence of RPA1 deficiency. To test this possibility, we measured the activation status of ATM in HeLa cells 48 or 72 h after transfection with SCR or RPA1 siRNAs. Activation of ATM was assessed using an antibody (α-pATM-1981) that recognizes an activation-specific autophosphorylation site at Ser-1981 (29Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that ATM was autophosphorylated on Ser-1981 following transfection with RPA siRNA (Fig. 2C). Although autophosphorylation was detectable by 48 h, it was much more pronounced at 72 h post-transfection, which is consistent with the time course of DSB induction shown in Fig. 2A. The level of ATM autophosphorylation was about 3-fold less than that induced by 10 Gy of IR. From the combined findings, we conclude that prolonged RPA1 deficiency induces spontaneous DNA damage, activates ATM, and induces an ATM-dependent G2/M cell cycle checkpoint in HeLa cells. Effects of RPA siRNA on ATM and ATR Activation Following DNA Damage—We next sought to determine the relative requirement of RPA for the activation of ATM and ATR following DNA damage. The observation that ATM became autophosphorylated during prolonged RPA1 deficiency suggested that ATM activation does not require RPA. We formally tested this possibility and found that RPA1 siRNA had no effect on the autophosphorylation of ATM on Ser-1981 following exposure to 5 Gy of IR, validating that RPA is not required for the activation of ATM in response to this stimulus (Fig. 3). To determine the requirement of RPA for ATR activation, we examined the effects of siRNAs specific for RPA1 or RPA2 on the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser-317 (30Liu Q. Guntuku S.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). For comparative purposes, an ATR siRNA was employed as a side-by-side control. Interestingly, during the course of these experiments, we found that an RPA2 siRNA caused the coordinate down-regulation of RPA1, but not vice versa (Fig. 4A). The basis for this phenomenon is not known, but it was observed using several RPA2 siRNAs and may reflect a role for RPA2 as an RPA1 stability determinant. Immunoblot analysis using a CHK1 Ser-317 phospho-specific antibody revealed that neither RPA2 nor RPA1 siRNAs substantially inhibited the phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser-317 following exposure of HEK 293T cells to hydroxyurea (3 mm), UV light (25 J/m2), or IR (10 Gy) (Fig. 4B). This lack of effect was probably not due to incomplete RPA1 or RPA2 suppression, as the levels of both proteins were drastically reduced 48 h after siRNA transfection (Fig. 4A). In the same experiment, an ATR siRNA suppressed CHK1 phosphorylation in response to all three stimuli (Fig. 4B). This experiment suggests that CHK1 phosphorylation on Ser-317 in response to hydroxyurea, UV light, and IR is ATR-dependent but RPA-independent. The requirement of RPA for the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of other ATR substrates was also explored. The cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor that is phosphorylated by ATM in vivo on Ser-121 in response to IR (24Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S.L. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have also shown that both ATM and ATR phosphorylate CREB on Ser-121 in vitro (Ref. 24Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S.L. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and data not shown). In support of a role for ATR as a mediator of CREB phosphorylation in vivo, we found that an ATR siRNA abolished the hydroxyurea- and UV-induced phosphorylation of the Ser-121 residue (Fig. 4C). In contrast, transfection with RPA1 or RPA2 siRNAs had no effect on CREB phosphorylation in response to either stimulus. Thus, like CHK1, the UV- and hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of CREB is ATR-dependent but RPA-independent. Finally, in this experiment we also observed that the IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB was unaffected by an ATR siRNA, which contrasts with the CHK1 result (compare Fig. 4, B and C). However, this finding is consistent with our previous report demonstrating that IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB is ATM-dependent (24Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S.L. Tibbetts R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study we have demonstrated that RPA is required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells; RPA insufficiency causes spontaneous DSBs, ATM-dependent G2/M arrest, and apoptotic cell death. The mechanism of DNA damage induction following RPA suppression is unknown but most likely involves the execution of an aberrant DNA replication cycle after RPA levels have declined below a critical threshold level. Consistent with this possibility, DSB induction and ATM activation were observed 72–96 h after RPA1 siRNA transfection, which is 24–48 h after RPA1 expression reached its minimum. It is possible that DSB induction reflects a structural role for RPA in protecting ssDNA filaments from spontaneous strand breakage. A non-exclusive possibility is that, in the prolonged absence of RPA, ssDNA present at replication forks is converted into DSBs through failed cycles of recombination. RPA functionally interacts with the enzymatic machinery of recombination, including RAD51, RAD52, and BLM, a helicase that contributes to the resolution of recombination intermediates present at stalled replication forks (32Brosh Jr., R.M. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

It is therefore conceivable that DSBs arise in RPA-deficient cells secondarily to gross DNA recombination abnormalities. In our hands an RPA1 siRNA did not substantially inhibit the IR-induced autophosphorylation of ATM nor did RPA1 or RPA2 siRNAs suppress ATR-dependent substrate phosphorylation in response to hydroxyurea or UV light. The RPA independence of ATR activation was somewhat surprising given several recent reports (16You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

Nevertheless, we failed to observe inhibitory effects of RPA1 or RPA2 siRNAs on the hydroxyurea- or UV-induced phosphorylation of three ATR substrates: CHK1, CREB, and RAD17 (Fig. 4). 2G. E. Dodson, Y. Shi, and R. S. Tibbetts, unpublished results. In these same experiments, an ATR siRNA strongly inhibited substrate phosphorylation, even though the ATR siRNA was less efficacious than either the RPA1 or RPA2 siRNAs (Fig. 4). Because of inherent caveats associated with RNAi-based experiments, we cannot rule out the possibility that a low threshold level of RPA was sufficient to activate ATR in our experiments. It is also formally possible that ATM contributes to UV- and hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of CHK1 in the absence of RPA. However, the findings are most consistent with the conclusion that a reduction in RPA dosage does not cause a corresponding linear decrease in ATR activity, as assessed by phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser-317 and CREB on Ser-121. Additional studies should clarify the role of RPA in the activation of ATR in response to genotoxic stress.

Redox modulation of proteins and ion channels through critical cysteines is thought to underlie the regulation of many intracellular signaling pathways.

However, the study of redox has grown to include discrete and reversible regulation of cell physiology, often through high affinity signaling molecules such as H2O2 and NO (6Gabbita S.P.

In biological systems, NO is broadly used for signaling by binding to specific cysteine sulfhydryls on target proteins. The high reactivity of NO toward protein sulfhydryls and heme groups may severely limit its free diffusion in biological systems, thus requiring a NO translocation and delivery system mediated by critical (reactive) protein sulfhydryls (7Pawloski J.R.

Additionally, Ca2+ release and single channel experiments suggest that oxidation, S-nitrosylation, and S-glutathionylation alter RyR1 sensitivity to Ca2+ and Mg2+ (24Aracena P. Sanchez G. Donoso P.

All of these redox interactions are thought to be mediated by cysteines, of which there are 100 per monomer of RyR1. It is thought that ∼25–50 of these cysteines are free and, based on reactivity, are commonly segregated into three to four classes (27Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar); whereas additional, yet unidentified cysteines are involved in redox regulation of the channel complex. Biochemical evidence using the fluorogenic sulfhydryl probe 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) to label junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (JSR) preparations (0.1–1.0 pmol of CPM/μg of JSR protein) indicate, based on the labeling kinetics and pattern of proteins adducted, that RyR1 contains a group or class of hyperreactive sulfhydryls that are conformationally sensitive and exhibit the greatest reactivity in the closed state of the channel (30Liu G.

Additional biochemical and biophysical techniques indicate that this group of six to eight hyperreactive or critical cysteines bestow sensitivity to oxygen tension that is important in NO binding of Cys-3635 (14Eu J.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35902-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The reversibility of RyR1 activation by redox potential changes and physiological levels of NO implies a delicate intracellular redox signaling mechanism. These functional data illustrate the critical role hyperreactive sulfhydryls play in redox regulation of RyR1; however, aside from the NO and calmodulin binding site of Cys-3635, the identity of the additional hyperreactive or critical cysteines remains uncertain. This report identifies the hyperreactive sulfhydryls of RyR1 via post-translational modification with CPM and a mass spectrometric methodology. Labeling of JSR vesicles is performed with discriminating concentrations of CPM under conditions favoring RyR1 channel closure, which has been previously shown to specifically label hyperreactive cysteines within the channel complex and selectively eliminate its redox sensing capabilities (21Feng W.

Subsequent to this labeling reaction, the CPM-adducted RyR1 is subjected to tryptic digestion, sequential HPLC steps, and two methods of mass spectrometry. This methodology yields RyR1 sequence data and exact peptide masses corresponding to calculated CPM and hydrolyzed-CPM-adducted molecular masses, enabling the identification of 7 CPM-adducted cysteines of RyR1, including the NO binding site of Cys-3635. This work provides the first structural elucidation of most, and possibly all hyperreactive sulfhydryls of RyR1 that may regulate channel activity in response to changes in the local redox environment. A method is outlined that may have general applicability for identification of critical cysteines within redox-regulated proteins. Materials—For sulfhydryl labeling, KCl and MOPS (>99.5%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, MgCl2·6H2O from EM Scientific (Gibbstown, NJ), and CPM from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). JSR membrane preparation, CPM labeling, and electrophoresis were performed using NANOpure water from a Barnstead International purifier (model D4751, Dubuque, IA). Solvents for tryptic digestion and HPLC were High Purity Solvents from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Ammonium acetate (HPLC grade) and trifluoroacetic acid (protein sequence analysis grade) used in HPLC mobile phases were obtained from Fluka BioChemika (Bucks SG, Switzerland). Ultra Smooth Polypropylene or Low Retention Microcentrifuge Tubes (0.65 or 1.5 ml, Island Scientific, Bainbridge Island, WA) were used during tryptic digestion and manual collection of HPLC fractions. Concentrations during in-gel digestion and of HPLC fractions were performed using an SVC-200H Savant SpeedVac concentrator system (GMI, Inc., Albertville, MN). Electrophoresis gels were cast with 30% Duracryl (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). Protein assays were based on the method described in Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation—JSR was isolated from male New Zealand White rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle using the method previously described in Saito et al. (35Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). CPM Labeling of JSR—CPM was prepared and used as described in Liu et al. (30Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar). The labeling of the most reactive cysteines present in JSR was performed as previously described, with solutions degassed under vacuum. JSR vesicles were incubated while continuously stirring in RyR closed buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and 1 μg/ml leupeptin from Sigma-Aldrich at 37 °C for 3–5 min prior to addition of CPM (1 pmol/μg of JSR protein) to a final volume of 25 ml. The reaction proceeded for 1 min before being placed on ice, a time previously shown under closed conditions to complete the reaction (30Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar). CPM-labeled JSR was pelleted at 146,000 × g (raverage) and 4 °C for 3 h using a Ti-50.2 rotor (Beckman) and resuspended in RyR closed buffer. Gel Electrophoresis—Ensuing protein denaturation in Laemmli Sample Buffer from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA) at 37 °C for 1 h, CPM-RyR1 was isolated from labeled JSR vesicles using SDS-PAGE in large format gels (20 × 20 × 0.1 cm) under constant 25 mA. The resolving gel (pH 8.8) consisted of a two-phase composition, the bottom 60% consisting of 10% acrylamide and the top 40% consisting of 3–10%; a 10-well 3% stacking gel (pH 6.8) was also used. CPM-RyR Digestion—In-gel tryptic digestion procedures were based on methods described in Shevchenko et al. (36Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7832) Google Scholar) and Wilm et al. (37Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). CPM-labeled RyR1 excised from each SDS-PAGE gel was washed thoroughly four times (15 min each) with water, diced into approximately 1-mm squares, and dried via the SpeedVac in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (3–6 tubes). Gel pieces were subsequently reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8, 55 °C) for 1 h and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 45 min in the dark at room temperature. Gel pieces were washed with 100 mm NH4HCO3 and partially dehydrated with acetonitrile before complete dehydration via SpeedVac. Finally, the CPM-RyR1 was digested in 50% NH4HCO3, pH 7.8–8.0, containing sequence grade TPCK-modified trypsin (catalog no. V5111, Promega, Madison, WI) at a final concentration range of 10 to 25 ng/μl (37 °C) for 24 h. Peptides were extracted once each with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then 5% formic acid-acetonitrile (50:50). The digested CPM-RyR1 from each gel was then combined and concentrated by SpeedVac to 100 μl for analytical HPLC analysis. Sequential HPLC—Initial separation of tryptic digested CPM-labeled RyR was performed using a Vydac (catalog no. 218TP52, Hesperia, CA) analytical C-18 reverse phase HPLC column (2.1-mm inner diameter × 25-cm length) on a Waters 600 system (Milford, MA). Separations were performed at 0.5 ml/min using mobile phases A (25 mm ammonium acetate in 10% acetonitrile) and B (22.5 mm ammonium acetate in 80% acetonitrile) with initial conditions of 83% A and 17% B that changed linearly to 70% A and 30% B over 80 min, then to 100% B over 10 min. Separation was completed with 100% B for 10 min. The eluant was monitored with a variable wavelength Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA) 1100 UV detector monitoring absorbance at UV 214 nm for peptide detection and a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) 535 fluorescence detector with a standard flow cell (12 μl) monitoring emission at 469 nm from excitation at 384 nm for detection of CPM-adducted peptides. Fluorescence fractions from analytical HPLC were subjected to additional separation using a Vydac (catalog no. 218TP51) microbore C-18 reverse phase HPLC column (1.0-mm inner diameter × 25-cm length) with an ABI model 140B Solvent Delivery System. Separations were performed at 80 μl/min using mobile phase A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile) with an initial condition of 95% A that decreased linearly to 65% over 10 min, then to 40% over 50 min, and then to 5% over 10 min. Separation was completed with 5% A for 5 min. Samples were loaded in multiple injections under the initial conditions, and the signal was allowed to return to baseline before onset of the run. A dual detection system was again employed, using an ABI model 785A Programmable Absorbance Detector monitoring absorbance at UV 214 nm for peptide detection and a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) 535 fluorescence detector with a 2-μl semimicro flow cell (catalog no. 20662817) monitoring emission at 469 nm from excitation at 384 nm for detection of CPM-adducted peptides. Mass Spectrometry—Samples were analyzed in a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Biflex III, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and in a quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer with QqT geometry, where Q is the quadrupole analyzer, q is the RF-only quadrupole, and T is the time-of-flight analyzer (QSTAR, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for direct electrospray MS (ESI) and tandem ESI (ESI MS/MS) experiments. In both cases the spectra were generated in positive ion mode. The MALDI-TOF instrument was equipped with a nitrogen laser operating at an output of 337.1 nm with a pulse width of 3 ns and a repetition rate of 6 Hz. The instrument was operated in reflector mode, 19.3-kV acceleration potential, 20.0-kV reflector potential, 2- to 4-ns time base, and 10- to 30-ms delay. The output signal of the detector was digitized at a sampling rate of 500 MHz/channel using a 1-GHz Lecroy digitizer. A camera mounted on a microscope allowed inspection of the sample crystallization. The crystals on the target were sampled randomly, with major coverage of the spot. External calibration was performed with angiotensin II (Sigma, A9525) and somatostatin 28 (Sigma, S6135) with molecular masses according to the (M+H)+ ions at m/z 1046.53 Da (angiotensin II, monoisotopic mass), m/z 3147.47 Da (somatostatin 28, monoisotopic mass). For analysis, first a 0.5-μl matrix solution, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Hewlett Packard, part number G2054-85010) then 0.5 μl of the sample (protein digest) were spotted onto the stainless steel tip and allowed to dry at room temperature. The quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer was controlled by Analyst-QS version 1.0 software with Service Pack 3 installed. This instrument was equipped with a nano-spray ionization source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Voltage on the Protana “medium” capillary tips was 900 V. External two-point calibration was performed using the singly charged ions of CsI and a peptide with nominal mass of 828.5 Da. Mass accuracy was typically better than 10 ppm, and resolution was typically better than 7000 full-width half-maximum. The flow rate of the nanospray source was ∼25–50 nl/min. Nitrogen was employed as the curtain gas at 25 arbitrary units. The orifice voltage was set at 80 V for all samples, whereas the focusing ring was set to 250 V and the skimmer was kept at 30 V. The TOF analyzer was set to acquire spectra at a rate of 7 kHz over the mass range 100–3000 Da. The resultant spectra are the averages of 100–300 consecutive spectra. MS Data Analysis—The generated mass spectral data were transformed into ASCI format for analysis using MassLynx 4.0 software, including the MaxEnt module for signal reconstruction (Waters/Micromass, Manchester, UK). Theoretical masses for 0, 1, 2, and 3 positively charged peptides from full tryptic digestion of RyR1 were generated using the MassLynx 4.0 protein peptide editor module. Additional peptide masses were calculated for all cysteine containing peptides based on adduction by the 402.16-Da CPM and 420.17-Da hydrolyzed-CPM (see Fig. 1A). For peptides containing two cysteine residues, CPM modifications are assumed identical. Additionally, peptides with one uncleaved Arg or Lys were allowed (first order incompletion). The mass calculations for unmodified RyR1 peptides containing cysteines and all modified RyR1 peptides were merged into one Microsoft Excel data base used to screen masses generated by MS. Peptide sequence information obtained from MS/MS experiments facilitates the data base mass comparisons and was used whenever possible. A detailed description of the data base generation and the data base, are given in the Supplemental Material. CPM Labeling, SDS-PAGE, and In-gel Tryptic Digestion—A schematic illustrating the identification procedure is included in Fig. 1B. The paramount first step in the identification of RyR1 hyperreactive sulfhydryls is their specific labeling by CPM under physiologically relevant, well characterized conditions. To achieve this, RyR1 hyperreactive sulfhydryls were labeled as described under “Experimental Procedures” using discriminating amounts of CPM to label JSR (1 pmol of CPM/μg of protein), a membrane fraction containing proteins, and cellular components necessary for normal RyR1 function. The CPM labeling of JSR was performed 24 times over a period of 2 days, yielding ∼15 mg of CPM-labeled JSR protein. At 1 pmol of CPM/μg of protein, the JSR used in this procedure produced CPM labeling rate constants under RyR1 open (20 μm Ca2+) and closed (10 mm Mg2+) of 0.00156 ± 0.00003 and 0.04469 ± 0.00016 s–1, respectively. The significantly faster rate of thioether adduct formation under channel-closed conditions was consistent with previously reported results (30Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, CPM labeling of JSR under the RyR1 closed conditions used in this procedure has been previously shown to selectively eliminate RyR1 redox sensing (21Feng W. Liu G. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35902-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) through specific binding of hyperreactive sulfhydryls (30Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Xia R. Stangler T. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36556-36561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Size separation of CPM-RyR1 thioether adducts from the other JSR proteins was achieved using SDS-PAGE (a total of nine gels). A representative gel image illustrating the CPM fluorescence pattern is shown in Fig. 2, which is consistent with previously reported results (30Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The additional fluorescent bands are currently under a similar investigation. In addition to providing clean separation of the CPM-RyR1 adducts, SDS-PAGE provides an excellent medium for full tryptic digestion, which generally yields doubly charged cationic peptides that are highly amenable to MS sequencing. Digested peptides were extracted from the gel matrix, frozen with liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C until separated by analytical HPLC. Successful tryptic digestion was verified in subsequent HPLC profiles. HPLC Separations—A monomer of RyR1 (5037 amino acids) generates 505 predicted tryptic cleavage products that can be separated using sequential steps of analytical and microbore HPLC. For each large format gel (nine total), the digested RyR1 peptides were subjected to C-18 reverse phase analytical HPLC. Fluorescence detection of CPM-adducted peptides using 384-nm excitation and 469-nm emission wavelengths generated a similar pattern for all nine analytical HPLC separations; a representative chromatogram is included in Fig. 3A. Each analytical HPLC chromatogram contained seven to eight dominant fluorescence peaks that were combined and concentrated into groups A, B, and C based on retention times: group A containing two to three peaks and eluting from 23 to 31 min, group B containing one peak eluting from 31 to 38 min, and group C containing three to four peaks eluting from 49 to 64 min (Fig. 3A). Several smaller fluorescence peaks were routinely observed between groups B and C (44–48 min), which were not analyzed due to their relatively low intensity and variable profile. Of the total fluorescence signal, groups A, B, and C represent 60–70%, with the variable peaks between groups B and C contributing ∼10%. Minor peaks and a slightly increasing baseline constitute the remaining fluorescence signal. To achieve greater resolution of the CPM-adducted RyR1 peptides, a microbore HPLC separation was performed on the pooled and concentrated analytical HPLC groups, monitoring fluorescence and UV absorbance. A representative chromatogram of group C in Fig. 3B illustrates improved, but incomplete resolution of the fluorescence peaks. Complete resolution of individual CPM-adducted RyR1 peptides occurred in subsequent MS analysis. One microbore separation was performed on Group B, whereas two were performed on groups A and C. The second group C chromatogram is included in Fig. 3B. To possibly facilitate MS ionization, each fluorescent microbore fraction was partially hydrolyzed in 1% formic acid for 1 week under the storage conditions of 4 °C. Prior to MS analysis, samples were concentrated via SpeedVac to ∼10 μl, and acetonitrile was added to improve spray ionization efficiency. Mass Spectrometry—To identify the specific cysteines adducted by CPM, the fluorescence eluant from microbore HPLC was subjected to MS analysis using two methods, direct MALDI-TOF MS (MALDI) and ESI MS/MS (ESI). Both provide accurate peptide mass determinations with mass accuracies of 50 ppm for MALDI and better than 10 ppm for ESI. The ESI was the primary choice due to the higher mass accuracy and sequencing capabilities. Analysis of all fluorescent microbore eluants required 12 MALDI, 11 direct ESI, and 67 ESI product ion MS experiments. The charge state of the ions measured by MS are denoted by (M+nH)n+, where n is the charge of the ion due to the addition of protons. In total, 7 CPM-adducted cysteines were identified from 6 digested peptides (one containing two cysteines), summarized in Table I and outlined as follows: 1) Cys-3635 (peptide 3631–3637) adducted by hydrolyzed-CPM was found in three microbore HPLC fractions of group C based on the theoretical peptide mass of (M+H)+ 1185.58 Da and MS/MS sequence identification. The peptide fragment was found in MALDI as a high intensity signal at (M+H)+ 1185.71 Da (Fig. 4A) and in direct ESI by a low intensity signal at (M+2H)2+ 593.24 Da that corresponds to the predicted value of (M+H)+ 1185.58 Da (Fig. 4B).

The kinase was found to complex with glycogen phosphorylase, glycogen debranching enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and creatine kinase in the SR membrane.

Different studies have been conducted to determine whether membrane-bound CaM kinase could phosphorylate different substrate proteins by virtue of its proximity effects and thereby regulate SR function. Although the calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR) and the calcium pump/Ca2+-ATPase in skeletal muscle SR were shown to be substrates of CaMKIIβ (13Hain J. Nath S. Mayrleitner M.

Moreover, there is clear evidence that the RyR and calcium pump are regulated by local ATP, Ca2+, and CaM through direct ligand binding (15Zhu X. Ghanta J. Walker J.W. Allen P.D. Valdivia H.H. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Laver D.R. Lenz G.K.E. Lamb G.D. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Jóna I.

In this regard, both Ca2+ and CaM are present at the SR, and the level of ATP is believed to be tightly controlled through a membrane-bound glycolytic machinery involving phosphorylase b, creatine kinase, and GAPDH (18Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Han J.-W. Thieleczek R. Varsanyl M. Mayr G.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 99: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Cuenda A. Nogues M. Henao F. Gutierrez-Merino C. J. Biol.

Res. 1995; 77: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Studies show that membrane-associated GAPDH is able to support an ATP-regenerating system at the SR, which is tightly coupled to the calcium transport function (18Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Han J.-W. Thieleczek R. Varsanyl M. Mayr G.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 99: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Cuenda A. Nogues M. Henao F. Gutierrez-Merino C. J. Biol.

Res. 1995; 77: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). How the glycolytic machinery is targeted to the SR membrane and whether this local ATP-generating system could be regulated in response to the calcium signal and muscle contraction remains to be defined. Recent studies also suggest that the local concentration of NADH can regulate the calcium transport activities of the SR (21Zima A.V. Copello J.A. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). How modulations in NADH concentrations at the SR membrane can be achieved remains unknown.Here, we examined the functional significance of the SR membrane-bound CaMKIIβM. We have utilized a proteomics-based approach to identify potential binding partners of the muscle-specific CaM kinase. This approach has identified several enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, including GAPDH, pyruvate kinase, and LDH, as well as enzymes involved in glycogen mobilization, such as phosphorylase b kinase and the debranching enzyme. Importantly, our results reveal that CaMKIIβM can phosphorylate these associated proteins and specifically increase the activity of GAPDH in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner. In view of the previous studies that implicate a role for local ATP and NADH in the regulation of SR function and excitation-contraction coupling, our results suggest that the membrane-bound CaMKIIβM may be important for targeting the glycolytic machinery to the SR and modulate the local levels of NADH and ATP in response to calcium signaling in skeletal muscle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of Muscle-specific CaM Kinases and Its Expression—An oligo(dT)-primed lambda Zap II cDNA library from skeletal muscle (Stratagene) was screened with a 500-bp DNA probe encompassing the coding region of the variable domain of rat brain CaMKII. The probe was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using rat brain RNA and β subunit-specific primers (5′-CTG AAG AAG TTC AAT GCA AGG AGG-3′ or 5′-GCA GCA GGT TCT CAA AGT AGA ATC-3′) and labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random prime labeling kit from Amersham Biosciences. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in 10% polyethylene glycol, 1.5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, and 7% SDS for 12 h, then followed by four washes in 1–0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The membranes were exposed to Biomax MR films, and cDNAs identified on tertiary screening were isolated and subcloned into pBluescript SK by in vivo excision as per Stratagene. Positive clones were categorized by restriction endonuclease mapping and size analysis. Overlapping clones were sequenced on both the strands by an automated ABI sequencer using M13F and M13R primers and sequences analyzed with Sequaid II (University of Kansas) and BLAST.Full-length skeletal muscle CaMKβIIM as well as the brain isoforms were cloned in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in pGEX 3xΔB vector in EcoRI site. Escherichia coli DH5α containing recombinant proteins were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The GST fusion proteins were isolated on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) following sonication in PBST containing 1% Nonidet P-40.Isolation of Cytosolic and SR Membrane Proteins—The preparation of SR vesicles was based on previously described protocols (11Bayer K.U. Harbers K. Schulman H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5598-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2365-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly dissected back muscle from rabbits was washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, trimmed of fat and connective tissue, cut into cubes, and either frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –110 °C or freshly processed. The fresh or thawed muscle cubes were suspended in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin; in 5 ml/g tissue). The muscle was homogenized in a Waring blender with 5× 20-s high speed bursts. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2600 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant so obtained was centrifuged at 186,000 × g for 1 h, cytosolic supernatant was saved, and SR membrane preparation was re-suspended in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 400 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and dispersed with 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. SR proteins were aliquoted and stored at –110 °C for further use. Protein quantification of each fraction was performed according to Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—CaM kinase activity was assayed as described previously with autocamtide-2 (KKALRRQETVDAL) as a substrate peptide (24Schworer C.M. Rothblum L.I. Thekkumkara T.J. Singer H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14443-14449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure Ca2+/CaM-dependent or “autonomous activity,” CaM kinase protein was incubated for 30 s to 5 min in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.4 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.4 × 10–5 cpm), 100 μm [Ca2+]Free (Bers (25Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), or 5 mm EGTA (control reaction) at 30 °C. At the end of incubation, aliquots (25 μl) of the reaction mixtures were applied on Whatman 3MM filter papers, washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and dried, and radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation counter.A GAPDH-catalyzed reaction was assayed at 25 °C by monitoring the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm in an assay mixture containing 25 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm NAD+, and 0.1 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). The reaction was initiated by adding an appropriately diluted enzyme solution in the above reaction mixture. For reactions studying CaM kinase-dependent phosphorylation of GAPDH with CaMKIIβM, the reaction was started by addition of GAP.Aldolase assay was carried out by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm (A340/min) in a coupled assay as described previously (26Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. Biochem. 1994; 33: 12291-12297Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Aldolase was diluted in 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4) and added to a cuvette containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.16 mm NADH, and 10 μg/ml GAPDH/triose phosphate isomerase in 50 mm triethanolamine buffer (pH 7.4). Assays (1 ml) were performed in triplicate at 30 °C, and the reaction was initiated by addition of substrate.Pyruvate kinase activity was determined in an LDH-coupled assay system by measuring the A340/min resulting from the oxidation of NADH as described by Imamura and Tanaka (27Imamura K. Tanaka T. Biochem. J. 1982; 131: 223-228Google Scholar). The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP, 0.17 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenol pyruvate and 2 units of LDH in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated by addition of phosphoenol pyruvate.LDH activity was measured (28Narang S. Narang N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1974; 49B: 477-490Google Scholar) by pyruvate reduction in the presence of NADH with NAD+ formation in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 0.18 mm NADH, 0.6 mm sodium pyruvate, and appropriately diluted enzyme at 25 °C. The production of NAD+ was followed by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm.Glycogen phosphorylase activity was measured as described by Helmreich and Cori (29Helmreich E. Cori C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 52: 647-654Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.1), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% glycogen, 50 nm glucose 1,6-diphosphate, 0.6 mm NADP, 4 units of phosphoglucomutase, and 0.8 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In a series of experiments the effects of CaMKIIβM phosphorylation on the activity of this enzyme were determined in the absence of AMP in the above buffer.GST Pull-down Assays—GST pull-down assays were carried out by immobilizing GST and GST-tagged CaMKIIβM to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Immobilized fusion proteins (12 μg) were incubated with SR membrane or cytosolic proteins (500 μg) in 1 ml of TBS (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, plus 0.1% Triton X-100 with 1 mm free Ca2+) buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The salt concentrations in the buffer used were similar to that used by others (30Burgueno J. Blake D.J. Benson M.A. Tinsley C.L. Esapa C.T. Canela E.I. Penela P. Mallol J. Mayor Jr., F. Lluis C. Franco R. Ciruela F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37545-37552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Beads were washed four times in TBS. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue or silver staining and identified by immunoblotting with antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 2 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) in 1 ml of reaction volume containing 500 μg of SR membrane or cytosolic protein, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, and the indicated concentrations of either anti-CaMKIIβ antibody (Cbβ-1) or control IgG (5 μg/ml each). Immunoprecipitates were captured by protein-A/G-agarose (70 μl), washed in lysis buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After equilibration in transfer buffer (15 mm glycine, 20 mm Tris, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol), protein were electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes (32 mA, overnight). Membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk in 1× PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h, and incubated with 1:5000 diluted anti-CaMKIIβ (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or GAPDH antibodies (Advanced Immunochemicals) for 1 h. After further washing with PBST, chemiluminescent detection was performed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).Phosphorylation of Substrate Proteins—Phosphorylation of target proteins of CaMKIIβM was analyzed by a GST pull-down-coupled phosphorylation reaction. GST pull-down proteins as obtained in the pull-down assay were subjected to a Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphorylation reaction at 30 °C in MOPS-NaOH buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.4 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.4 × 10–5 cpm), 40 μg/ml calmodulin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm [Ca2+]Free (+) or 5 mm EGTA (–) for 15 min. After the incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding sample buffer to the reaction mixture, and proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and further detected on Kodak BioMax MR film.Phosphorylation of each individual target protein was also analyzed by incubating GST-CaMKIIβM (0.03 mg/ml) with purified protein (0.5 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h followed by a phosphorylation reaction as described above. At the end of incubation, aliquots of the reaction mixture were applied on Whatman 3MM filter papers, washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and dried. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Control samples contained only the protein kinase sample in the reaction.Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were excised, destained, and then subjected to tryptic digestion to produce peptides in the range of 1000–3000 Da. The peptides were concentrated and desalted using C18 Zip-Tips™ (Millipore, Bedford, MA). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry peptide mass mapping was performed using a Waters [email protected] and Q-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser at an accuracy of 0.05–0.15 atomic mass unit by Dr. David Hyndman at the Queens University Facility.RESULTSDistribution of CaMKIIβM in Cellular Fractions—Subcellular distribution of muscle-specific CaMKIIβM was carried out by Western blot analysis of SR and cytosolic fractions from fast twitch skeletal muscle with CaMKIIβ monoclonal antibody (Cbβ-1). This identified a CaMKIIβM polypeptide of ∼73 kDa in SR (Fig. 1, lane 2) but not the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1, lane 1), consistent with that published previously (11Bayer K.U. Harbers K. Schulman H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5598-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The recombinant kinase was expressed as a GST fusion protein, and the molecular mass of GST-conjugated CaMKIIβM was 98 kDa with several truncated products of ∼73, 64, 56, 41, and 30 kDa being also detected by CaMKIIβ antibody (Fig. 1, lane 3).The functional activity of recombinant CaMKIIβM was examined in an autocamtide-2 assay system (Upstate CaM kinase assay kit), and this indicated an increase of ∼90-fold in phosphotransferase activity in the presence of calcium (100 μm [Ca2+]Free) and CaM (2 μm), which corresponds to ∼4.86 pmol/min/μg.Molecular Interactions of the Muscle-specific CaMKIIβM—To determine the functional significance of the SR membrane-bound CaMKIIβM, identification of the potential interacting proteins was carried out using GST pull-down assays with cytosolic and detergent-soluble SR fractions from skeletal muscle. Characterization of the interacting proteins with respect to molecular mass revealed that recombinant GST-CaMKIIβM specifically binds polypeptides of ∼55, 47, 44, 39, 36, and 32 kDa from the cytosol (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and of ∼177, 97, 61, 44, and 36 kDa from the SR membrane fraction (Fig. 2B, lane 2). There was no binding of these polypeptides to GST alone (Fig. 2A, lane 4 and Fig. 2B, lane 4). Furthermore, recombinant GST-CaMKIIβM in TBS buffer served as an additional control with the main 98-kDa fusion protein and several truncated products notably of ∼73, 64, 56, 41, and 30 kDa being also visualized (Fig. 2A, lane 1 and Fig. 2B, lane 1). The expressed kinase and its truncated products have been specifically labeled in parentheses in Fig. 2 (A, lane 1 and B, lane 1) and showed a similar migration pattern as seen in Western blot analysis with anti-CaMKIIβ antibody (see Fig. 1, lane 3). The 25-kDa GST protein visualized in the 10% SDS gel in panel A migrated out of the 7.5% gel in panel B, and a nonspecific polypeptide of ∼50 kDa was visualized in each lane.The Glycolytic Enzymes Are Interacting Proteins of CaMKIIβM—To further identify the specifically bound polypeptides, MALDI-TOF was employed, and this revealed the interaction of CaMKIIβM with enzymes of glycolytic pathway and glycogen metabolism (Table I). The interacting proteins from cytosolic fraction (Table I and Fig. 2A, lane 2) were determined to be LDH and enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, namely aldolase A, GAPDH, enolase, and pyruvate kinase, whereas those from the SR fraction (Table I and Fig. 2B, lane 2) revealed an identity with glycogen phosphorylase b, glycogen debranching enzyme, creatine kinase, and GAPDH. The data revealed that GAPDH and creatine kinase were present as interacting proteins in both cytosolic and SR membrane fractions. An interacting polypeptide of 61 kDa in the pull-down assay with the SR proteins (Fig. 2B, lane 2, asterisk) and another of 275 kDa (not shown) in pull-down assay with cytosolic proteins were determined to be CaMKIIβ, indicating the same class of kinase-kinase interactions. In this regard, the CaM kinase family of enzymes is known to exist as oligomers, and these data are consistent with the self-assembly of these molecules into multisubunit enzyme complexes (1Hudmon A. Schulman H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 593-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Two additional polypeptides of 138 and 125 kDa from cytosolic fraction were also seen when the pull-down proteins were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE (data not shown), which were identified by MALDI-TOF as phosphorylase b kinase α and β chains, respectively (Table I).Table IIdentity of the CaMKIIbM-associated complex in skeletal muscleProteinMassPeptide matchCoverageMOWSE scorekDa%SR membraneGlycogen debranching enzyme17748343.955e+031Glycogen phosphorylase9722231.170e+007Creatine kinase M449291.541e+06Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase369322.149e+04CytosolicPhosphorylase B kinase α chain13816128.661e+04Phosphorylase B kinase β chain12519245.919e+08Pyruvate kinase M5517222.084e+007Enolase β4719411.581e+005Creatine kinase M4415333.829e+004Aldolase A3917388.081e+010Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase3612363.615e+005l-Lactate dehydrogenase3217324.624e+005 Open table in a new tab The Glycolytic Enzymes Are Substrates of CaMKIIβM—Because the protein-protein interaction assays indicated a specific interaction with the molecules of the glycolysis pathway, we examined whether these polypeptides were phosphorylated by CaMKIIβM. The kinase-associated proteins isolated in the GST pull-down assay were examined in a phosphorylation reaction in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and CaM, and the autoradiogram showing 32P incorporation is shown in Fig. 3. A number of the interacting proteins were phosphorylated in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner in cytosolic (Fig. 3, panel b) and SR membrane (Fig. 3, panel c) fractions of skeletal muscle tissue. These substrate proteins correspond to the polypeptides of ∼55, 47, 44, 39, and 36 kDa from the cytosol (Fig. 3, panel b), which were identified as pyruvate kinase, enolase, creatine kinase, aldolase, and GAPDH, respectively, and the ∼97-, 61-, and 36-kDa polypeptides from the SR membrane extract (Fig. 3, panel c), which correspond to glycogen phosphorylase b, CaMKIIβ, and GAPDH, respectively. When these polypeptides were separated on SDS-PAGE, the phosphorylated protein bands appeared at approximately corresponding positions and order (Fig. 3, panels b and c), as found in GST pull-down experiments (compare with Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting the Ca2+/CaM-dependent 32P incorporation into these interacting proteins was enhanced by CaMKIIβM. Autophosphorylation of CaMKIIβM fusion protein and its truncated products is seen as 98-, 73-, 64-, 56-, and 41-kDa bands (Fig. 3, panel a).Fig. 2CaMKIIβM associates with cytosolic and SR proteins. Cytosolic and solubilized SR membrane proteins (500 μg) from skeletal muscle were incubated with GST alone or GST-CaMKIIβM fusion protein (∼12 μg). Bound proteins were eluted, resolved in SDS-PAGE (10% in panel A or 7.5% in panel B), and stained with Coomassie Blue. In A: lane 1, GST-CaMKIIβM in TBS buffer; lane 2, GST-CaMKIIβM pull-down of cytosolic proteins; lane 3, GST-GST in TBS buffer; lane4, GST-GST pull-down of cytosolic proteins. In B: lane 1, GST-CaMKIIβM in TBS buffer; lane 2, GST-CaMKIIβM pull-down of SR proteins; lane 3, GST-GST in TBS buffer; lane 4, GST-GST pull-down of SR proteins. Molecular masses are in kilodaltons, and the masses of recombinant CaMKIIβM and its truncated products are represented in parentheses. GST-alone (25 kDa) control appeared as a doublet on the gel. These data are typical of ten independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3CaMKIIβM-interacting proteins are substrates of the kinase. Equal amounts of GST alone or GST-CaMKIIβM (12 μg) were incubated with cytosolic and SR membrane proteins (500 μg) and subjected to phosphorylation in the presence of 100 μm [Ca2+]Free (+) or 5 mm EGTA (–) and 2 μm CaM. Bound proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE: panel a, autophosphorylation of CaMKIIβM and its truncated products (shown in parentheses); panel b, phosphorylation of pull-down proteins from cytosolic fraction; and panel c, phosphorylation of pull-down proteins from SR membrane fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was further confirmed by reconstituting the individual purified protein with purified recombinant CaMKIIβM in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and CaM. These data shown in Table II indicated that pyruvate kinase, LDH, and GAPDH were good substrates of CaMKIIβM. These data are consistent with previous studies that indicate that GAPDH, LDH, and pyruvate kinase are associated with the SR membrane (21Zima A.V. Copello J.A. Blatter L.A.

The receptor has a large N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain that forms a homodimer, however, the intersubunit communication of ligand binding in the dimer remains unknown. Here, using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence change as a probe for ligand binding events, we examined whether allosteric properties exist in the dimeric ligand binding domain of the receptor. The indole ring of the tryptophan 110, which resides on the upper surface of the ligand binding pocket, sensed the ligand binding events. From saturation binding curves, we have determined the apparent dissociation constants (K0.5) of representative agonists and antagonists for this receptor (3.8, 0.46, 40, and 0.89 μm for glutamate, quisqualate, (S)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine ((S)-MCPG), and (+)-2-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (LY367385), respectively). Calcium ions functioned as a positive modulator for agonist but not for antagonist binding (K0.5 values were 1.3, 0.21, 59, and 1.2 μm for glutamate, quisqualate, (S)-MCPG, and LY367385, respectively, in the presence of 2.0 mm calcium ion). Moreover, a Hill analysis of the saturation binding curves revealed the strong negative cooperativity of glutamate binding between each subunit in the dimeric ligand binding domain.

Glutamate is a major neurotransmitter in the excitatory synapses of the central nervous system, and two types of glutamate receptors are expressed in nerve cells: one is an ionotropic glutamate receptor, and the other is a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). 1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; mGluR1, mGluR subtype 1; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; LBD, ligand binding domain; MCPG, α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine; LY367385, (+)-2-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine; PEG, polyethylene glycol.1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; mGluR1, mGluR subtype 1; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; LBD, ligand binding domain; MCPG, α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine; LY367385, (+)-2-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine; PEG, polyethylene glycol. The former is a glutamate-gated ion channel, which induces a synaptic potential upon glutamate binding, whereas the latter is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which induces various cellular responses to glutamate stimulation, e.g. inositol triphosphate production and the subsequent elevation of intracellular calcium, or a cytoplasmic cyclic AMP concentration change caused by the modulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Because these cellular responses modulate the degree of synaptic neurotransmission, mGluRs are believed to be involved in higher order neuronal activities such as memory, learning, and so on (1Nakanishi S.

One outstanding feature of the receptor is the large extracellular ligand binding domain (LBD), which is characteristic of the Class III GPCRs. The mGluR1 LBD consists of ∼520 amino acids and forms a clamshell-like bilobate domain (LB1 and LB2) (7Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H.

Our previous biochemical and crystallographic studies demonstrated that the LBD forms a homodimer by not only an intersubunit disulfide bond but also hydrophobic interactions (7Kunishima N.

In the crystal structures, one protomer of the dimeric LBD adopts two different conformations: an open conformation and a closed conformation. A symmetric structure with both protomers in the open conformation is observed in the absence of glutamate, whereas the structure of the glutamate binding state is asymmetric, because one protomer adopts the closed conformation and the other adopts the open conformation. Interestingly, even in the absence of glutamate, the asymmetric open-closed conformation is observed, implying that the open and closed conformations of the protomer are in equilibrium in an aqueous solution without ligands. Glutamate binding promotes the closing motion of the ligand binding pocket, so the closed conformation should be stabilized. Thus, the glutamate-bound open conformation observed in the crystal structure is a fascinating puzzle. One attractive explanation for this is an allosteric property in the dimeric LBD: the closed conformation in one protomer would negatively affect the binding mode of the other protomer. However, such an allosteric effect on ligand binding has not been demonstrated yet for this receptor. Some allosteric properties have been previously reported for several receptors. Extensive biochemical and crystallographic studies have been performed on the bacterial dimeric aspartate receptor, and the mechanism of negative cooperativity on aspartate binding has been elucidated on the basis of the structure (11Milburn M.V.

Allosteric properties are also inferred in several GPCRs (15Limbird L.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5007-5014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pizard A. Marchetti J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), however, in these cases, the observed cooperativity seems to result from oligomerization of receptors on the membrane surface. Thus, the allosteric properties in terms of subunit-subunit communication are more obscure in the GPCRs than those in the bacterial aspartate receptor. Recently, dimer formation by GPCRs has been detected, and ligand selectivity appears to be broader than previously expected (17Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 18Franco R. Canals M. Marcellino D. Ferre S. Agnati L. Mallol J. Casado V. Ciruela F. Fuxe K. Lluis C.

It was also reported that, in the heterodimeric γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor, the GB2 subunit and its association with the GB1 subunit control the agonist affinity in GB1 subunit (21Liu J.

Therefore, the cooperativity in dimeric GPCRs has become a current issue. In this context, our mGluR system provides a unique opportunity to decipher the cooperativity in the ligand binding event of Class III GPCR using a purified pre-formed dimer. To investigate whether allostery functions in ligand binding, it is essential to analyze a saturation ligand binding curve with a wide range of ligand concentrations from sub-nanomolar to millimolar. 3H-Labeled quisqualate, which is an agonist specific for mGluR1 and -5, is widely used in the ligand binding assay. However, this conventional assay cannot yield a saturation binding curve because of the upper limit of the applicable ligand concentration. Because the fluorescence emitted from tryptophan is sensitive to the environment surrounding the indole group, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence can be a good probe to sense ligand binding events (22Verjovski-Almeida S. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2940-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nelson S.W. Iancu C.V. Choe J.Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J.

Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 452-486Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the fluorescence spectrum of the intrinsic tryptophans of purified mGluR1 LBD changed upon ligand binding. The system led us to obtain saturation binding curves by titration of the tryptophan fluorescence with glutamate, a native ligand, and other non-native ligands, such as quisqualate, (S)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine ((S)-MCPG), and (+)-2-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (LY367385). These binding curves allowed us to determine the apparent binding constants of these ligands and to demonstrate the positive effect of calcium ions on agonist binding. Furthermore, Hill analyses of the titration curves revealed that negative cooperativity of glutamate binding exists between each protomer of the dimeric mGluR1 LBD.

Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) as the template. The forward primer for the PCR was designed at the N terminus of the LBD with a NotI site. The reverse primer was designed at the C terminus of the LBD (at the 1566th thymine in the mGluR1 cDNA) with the DNA sequence for the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) and a stop codon followed by an XbaI site. After verification by DNA sequencing, the PCR product was cloned into the pFastBac DUAL vector (Invitrogen) using the NotI and XbaI sites. The I120A and T188A point mutations were introduced into the FLAG-tagged LBD gene by replacing the NotI/PshAI region of the wild type with the same fragment containing the mutation, which was excised from the plasmid previously used in the mutation experiments (26Sato T. Shimada Y. Nagasawa N. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4314-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The W110V mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with pmGluR103 (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) as the template. After sequence verification, the NotI/PshAI fragment of this mutant was exchanged for that of the wild type on the pFastBac DUAL vector. Production of Baculoviruses for Protein Expression—Baculoviruses for protein expression were obtained by following the protocol of the Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Briefly, the vector DNA was transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). Then, the recombinant bacmid DNA purified from the DH10Bac cells was transfected into Sf9 insect cells, using the Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). After an incubation for 72 h at 27 °C, the viruses were harvested from the cell culture medium. Then, the recombinant viruses were amplified by re-infecting Sf9 cells to enhance the viral titer. Finally, we checked the viral titer by a plaque formation assay using an immobilized monolayer culture of Sf9 cells. Protein Expression and Purification—The wild-type and mutant FLAG-tagged LBD proteins were expressed by inoculating the baculoviruses into HighFive cells as previously described (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Tsuji Y. Shimada Y.

Purification of the protein was done by taking advantage of the FLAG tag. The cell culture medium (∼500 ml) into which the target protein was sufficiently secreted was collected 4–5 days after the inoculation. After the addition of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml, 2 μg/ml, and 0.1 mm for leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, respectively), the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Then, the supernatant was directly applied to ∼1 ml of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) packed in a disposable column (Bio-Rad). After the column was washed with a low salt buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 20 mm NaCl, the proteins bound to the beads were eluted by a high salt buffer containing the FLAG peptide at a concentration of 150 μg/ml, dissolved in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 300 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions were collected, and the protein was concentrated and buffer-exchanged to the assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl) using an Ultra-free centrifugation filter unit (Millipore). The protein concentration was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 126,500 m–1cm–1 as a dimer, which was calculated from the number of tryptophans, tyrosines, and cystines in the protein (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the FLAG-tagged protein was 119,800 as calculated from the amino acid sequence, including the C-terminal FLAG tag. Purification of the wild-type LBD of mGluR1 (non-tagged) was done as previously described by using an immunoaffinity column conjugated with monoclonal antibodies (mG1Na-1) (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the wild-type LBD was estimated to be 117,800 from the amino acid sequence. Steady-state Fluorescence Measurement—Steady-state tryptophan fluorescence was measured by an F-4500 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm at 20 °C using a stirring cuvette. Protein concentration was 0.67 μm as the dimer. Measurements were performed in a buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl with or without 2.0 mm CaCl2. Emission spectra from 300 to 400 nm were recorded. For the titration experiments, small aliquots of ligand (0.1–1.0% of total volume) were sequentially added to the cuvette, and the fluorescence intensity at 350 nm was recorded. Volume changes in the titration experiments were corrected before analyzing the data. To obtain the titration curves, we also used the peak values of the fluorescence spectra instead of the values at 350 nm, because the peak shift of the fluorescence spectrum would affect the calculated values of the Hill coefficients. Both calculations yielded similar Hill coefficient values, and, hence, in this report we used the values calculated from the fluorescence intensity at 350 nm. Transient Kinetics Measurement—Transient kinetics of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence change were measured with an SX18 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, UK) at 20 °C. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and the emission was monitored with a 335-nm longpass optical filter. The protein and ligand were dissolved in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl. Measurements were done with a fixed protein concentration of 0.84 μm (value after mixing). Ligand Binding Assay—The 3H-labeled ligand binding assay was performed using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method (10Tsuji Y. Shimada Y. Takeshita T. Kajimura N. Nomura S. Sekiyama N. Otomo J. Usukura J. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28144-28151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as previously described with minor modifications. Briefly, 20 nm3H-labeled quisqualate or glutamate (Amersham Biosciences) and the protein solution (1 μg of protein) were mixed in 150 μl of binding buffer composed of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, 6-kDa PEG was added to the sample to a final concentration of 15% with 3 mg/ml of γ-globulin. After vortexing and centrifugation, the precipitated material was washed twice with 1 ml of the binding buffer containing 8% of 6-kDa PEG, and then it was dissolved in 1 ml of water. After the addition of 14 ml of Clearsol II (Nacalai Tesque), the radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. Data Analysis of the Titration Experiments—Titration curves for glutamate and quisqualate binding were made by plotting the values of (F – F0)/ΔFmax against the ligand concentrations, where F and F0 are the fluorescence intensities in the presence and absence of ligand, respectively, and ΔFmax is the maximum value of the fluorescence change in the titration experiment. For the titration curves of (S)-MCPG and LY367385 binding, the values of (F0 – F)/ΔFmax were used because the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence decreased upon the addition of these antagonists. The titration curves were fitted to the following equation by the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy), ΔF/ΔFmax = SnH/(Kapp + SnH), where ΔF equals F – F0 or F0 – F, S is the concentration of the ligand, Kapp is the apparent dissociation constant, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Hill coefficients were also calculated from the Hill plot, which yielded values similar to those derived from the curve fitting. With respect to Kapp, we also obtained similar values from the half-maximal value of the titration curves. This value is denoted as K0.5 in the text, and we used it to estimate the affinity of the ligand in this report. To elucidate intersubunit allostery in the dimeric ligand binding domain of mGluR1, we worked out a plan to utilize the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence signal to detect a ligand binding event. For the first step, we constructed and purified the FLAG-tagged LBD of mGluR1 to test whether the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence changes upon ligand binding. Purification of the FLAG-tagged Ligand Binding Domain— Because the protein from the anti-FLAG-antibody-conjugated agarose gel was eluted with the FLAG peptide at a neutral pH instead of with an acidic or alkaline buffer, the protein damage was minimized. As analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining, the purified FLAG-tagged LBD was observed as almost a single band (Fig. 1A). It was previously reported that under the non-reduced conditions the two protomers of the mGluR1 LBD are cross-linked to form a dimer through an interprotomer disulfide bond even under the denaturing conditions on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Tsuji Y. Shimada Y. Takeshita T. Kajimura N. Nomura S. Sekiyama N. Otomo J. Usukura J. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28144-28151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Like the nontagged wild-type LBD, the band of the FLAG-tagged LBD under the reduced conditions (Fig. 1A, +DTT) was shifted to a position corresponding to twice the molecular weight under the non-reduced conditions (Fig. 1A, –DTT), indicating that the FLAG-tagged protein maintained the ability to form an interprotomer disulfide bond as demonstrated for the non-tagged LBD (9Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated the ligand binding ability of the FLAG-tagged LBD using a 3H-labeled quisqualate ([3H]quisqualate) by the previously described PEG-precipitation method (10Tsuji Y. Shimada Y. Takeshita T. Kajimura N. Nomura S. Sekiyama N. Otomo J. Usukura J. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28144-28151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The final concentration of [3H]quisqualate was 20 nm. As shown in Fig. 1B, the FLAG-tagged LBD bound the [3H]quisqualate at the same level as that of the non-tagged LBD. This indicates that the additional eight amino acids at the C terminus of the protein do not influence the ligand binding capacity. From these data, we concluded that the FLAG tag at the C terminus did not perturb the activities of the protein, and therefore, we utilized the FLAG-tagged LBD for the following experiments described below. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Changes of the FLAG-tagged LBD Induced by Ligand Binding—We examined whether the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence changed upon the addition of ligand. In the absence of ligand, the intrinsic tryptophans of the FLAG-tagged LBD exhibited an emission spectrum with a peak at ∼345 nm when excited at 290 nm (Fig. 2A, dotted line). Upon the addition of excess glutamate (1.0 mm final concentration), a native agonist for mGluR, the fluorescence spectrum changed in a manner such that the fluorescence intensity was enhanced by about 18% and the fluorescence maximum was slightly shifted by ∼1 nm toward a longer wavelength (red shift). Upon the addition of excess quisqualate (100 μm at final concentration), a non-native strong agonist for group I mGluRs, the emission spectrum was enhanced, but amplitude of the spectral change was less than that observed for glutamate addition (Fig. 2C). This result probably reflects some environmental differences between the glutamate and quisqualate binding states around the tryptophans that contribute toward sensing the ligand binding. As a control for these observations, we measured the emission spectrum of the T188A mutant. It has been demonstrated that this mutation dramatically reduced the binding affinity of agonists and that no cellular responses were detected in HEK293 cells expressing the full-length mGluR1 carrying the same mutation (26Sato T. Shimada Y. Nagasawa N. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4314-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2E, the emission spectrum of the mutant did not exhibit any noticeable change upon the addition of excess glutamate. Although we also examined the spectrum upon the addition of quisqualate, no effects were observed as well (data not shown). Therefore, the enhanced emission spectra observed for the wild-type FLAG-tagged LBD resulted from agonist binding to the protein. Fig. 2B shows fluorescence spectra in the presence and absence of (S)-MCPG (100 μm final concentration), an antagonist for mGluR1. In contrast to the results with the agonists, the fluorescence intensity of the intrinsic tryptophans decreased and the fluorescence maxima shifted toward a shorter wavelength (blue shift) upon the addition of (S)-MCPG. These changes were opposite to those observed for agonist binding. A similar spectral change was observed upon the addition of an excess of LY367385 (100 μm final concentration), another antagonist (Fig. 2D), suggesting that, in the ligand binding states of the two antagonists, the environments around tryptophans involved in the fluorescence change were similar to each other. On the other hand, no spectral change was observed upon the addition of (R)-MCPG (Fig. 2F), a stereoisomer of (S)-MCPG that does not bind to the mGluR1 LBD (8Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This result clearly indicates that the observed spectral changes are due to the binding of the antagonists. We measured the rate constants of ligand binding to the LBD with a stopped-flow apparatus. As shown in Fig. 3A, the tryptophan fluorescence was abruptly enhanced upon mixing with glutamate (0.5 mm after mixing), and it almost reached a plateau within 1 s. The time course of the fluorescence intensity change was roughly fitted to a single exponential curve. From the fitting curve, the observed rate constant (kobs) of glutamate binding to the LBD was estimated to be 22.2 s–1. On the other hand, upon mixing with (S)-MCPG (0.5 mm after mixing), the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was suddenly quenched and completely reached a plateau within 1 s (Fig. 3B). The time course of the fluorescence change was fitted well to a single exponential curve, and the observed rate constant was estimated to be 38.6 s–1. It should be noted that these rate constants of ligand binding are apparent rates measured only at the saturating concentration of ligands. They do not represent actual association rate constants of ligand. Identification of the Tryptophan Residue Contributing to the Spectral Change of the Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence— Tryptophan fluorescence in a protein is generally influenced by the surrounding environment. Water molecules, attacking the indole moiety of tryptophan, and polar side chains and peptide bonds in close proximity of the indole ring are major causes of tryptophan fluorescence quenching (28Chen Y. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9976-9982Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). There are seven tryptophan residues in one protomer (Trp-110, Trp-224, Trp-320, Trp-367, Trp-372, Trp-468, and Trp-500). To predict which tryptophan residue contributes to the observed spectral changes, we examined the environment around each tryptophan side chain using the atomic models. We first considered solvent accessibility of each tryptophan. To quantify it, we calculated the solvent-accessible area of each of the tryptophan side chains (indole rings) for the two distinct conformations of the protomer, i.e. the open conformation and the closed conformation, by the program SURFACE (29Lee B.

It serves to transfer electrons from NADPH to thioredoxin leading to its reduction. Interestingly, recent work has indicated that thioredoxin reductase can regulate the activity of transcription factors such as p53, hypoxia-inducible factor, and AP-1. Here, we describe that an alternative splicing variant of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1b) containing an LXXLL peptide motif, is implicated in direct binding to nuclear receptors. In vitro interaction studies revealed direct interaction of the TrxR1b with the estrogen receptors α and β. Confocal microscopy analysis showed nuclear colocalization of the TrxR1b with both estrogen receptor α and β in estradiol-17β-treated cells. Transcriptional studies demonstrated that TrxR1b can affect estrogen-dependent gene activation differentially at classical estrogen response elements as compared with AP-1 response elements. Based on these results, we propose a model where thioredoxin reductase directly influences the estrogen receptor-coactivator complex assembly on non-classical estrogen response elements such as AP-1. In summary, our results suggest that TrxR1b is an important modulator of estrogen signaling. The selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) is an integral part of the thioredoxin system.

In mammalian cells three TrxRs have been characterized, a cytoplasmatic one (TrxR1), a mitochondrial specific TrxR (TrxR2) (3Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Pedrajas J.R. Gustafsson J.A.

In addition to reducing Trx, TrxR1 can reduce proteins such as protein-disulfide isomerase and plasma glutathione peroxidase (6Nordberg J. Arner E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has a wide range of low molecular weight targets such as dehydroascorbic acid, lipoic acid, selenite, and selenocysteine, it can cleave S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) to glutathione and nitric oxide (6Nordberg J.

It has also been reported that TrxR1 is involved in the regulation of transcription factors such as p53, hypoxia-inducible factor and AP-1. Prostaglandins have been shown to covalently modify and inhibit the function of TrxR1 leading to the repression of p53 and hypoxia-inducible factor (9Moos P.J. Edes K. Cassidy P. Massuda E.

Furthermore, TrxR1 is involved in promoting the cell death effect of combined interferon and retinoic acid (10Hofmann E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X. Hassel B.A. Jagus R. Gutierrez P.L.

In addition, p53-dependent gene expression was inhibited in yeast lacking TrxR because of the oxidation and inactivation of Trx, suggesting that the effect of TrxR1 on p53 activity is mediated by the reduction of Trx (14Pearson G.D.

Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, TrxR1 has also been shown to regulate the activation of AP-1 although this is also thought to occur through its function of reducing Trx1 (16Karimpour S. Lou J. Lin L.L. Rene L.M. Lagunas L. Ma X. Karra S. Bradbury C.M. Markovina S. Goswami P.C. Spitz D.R. Hirota K. Kalvakolanu D.V. Yodoi J. Gius D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6317-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These examples indicate that TrxR1, alone and/or through Trx, may impact various transcriptional pathways. Estrogen receptors (ERs) belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of nuclear receptors that upon binding of ligand are activated and bind to specific DNA response elements to initiate transcription of target genes (17Steinmetz A.C. Renaud J.P. Moras D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 329-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Apart from promoting DNA binding, the ligand-induced conformational change of the ligand binding domain of the receptors enables them to recruit coactivators such as GRIP1 and SRC-1 and the histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP and pCAF to the response elements, leading to activation of transcription (18Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bevan C. Parker M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of ERs, it has been reported that, apart from the classical ER activation pathway that depends on the binding of ERs to the EREs (estrogen response elements), ER can regulate transcription even via AP-1 and SP-1 sites without ER binding to DNA (20Webb P.

We describe here a TrxR1 variant, referred to in this paper as TrxR1b, with an extension at the N terminus. Within the extra amino acid sequence we found the presence of a nuclear receptor motif (NR box) with the consensus sequence LXXLL, which mediates the binding of co-activators to their nuclear receptors (25Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Indeed, the presence of an LXXLL motif in the TrxR1b leads to the direct interaction of the protein with ERα and ERβ. As a result of the TrxR1b binding to the ERs, the reductase is translocated into the nucleus and colocalizes with the ERs. Furthermore, whereas TrxR1b enhances the transcriptional activity of the ERs at the classical EREs it effectively represses ER activity at AP-1 sites, suggesting that TrxR1 could be an important regulator of ER activity and ER-dependent cellular growth and differentiation. Plasmids—For the construction of the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-TrxR1b42-56 fusion, which includes the LXXLL motif found in the long form TrxR1, the oligos KDRF3′ (5′-AATTCTTAAGGGCCGTTCATTTTTAGTAGCTTTTGAAGTCTGCCCTCCTGATAG-3′) and KDRF5′ (5′-GATCCTATCAGGAGGGCAGACTTCAAAAGCTACTAAAAATGAACGGCCCTTAAG-3′) were annealed and subsequently ligated into an EcoRI- and BamHI-digested pGEX-4T3 vector. For the construction of the full-length protein-GST fusions, TrxR1a was amplified employing standard PCR techniques and the primers hTrxR15′ NdeI (5′-CGACTGCATATGAACGGCCCTGAAGATCTTCCC-3′) and hTrxR-13′ BamHI (5′-CCATGCGGATCCGCAGCAGCCAGCCTGGAGGATGC-3′), whereas TrxR1b was amplified with the primers KDRF5′ NdeI (5′-CGACTGCATATGTCATGTGAGGACGGTCGG-3′) and hTrxR13′ BamHI. The PCR products were purified and digested with NdeI and BamHI and then ligated into the pET11c vector. The open reading frame for GST was amplified from the pGEX-4T3 vector with the GST5′ BamHI (5′-CAAGCTGGATCCATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGGAAAATTAAG-3′) and GST3′ BamHI (5′-CTAGCAGGATCCCTATTTTGGAGGATGGTCGCCACCACC-3′) primers. After purification the PCR products were digested with BamHI and ligated in-frame into the pET11c vectors containing either TrxR1a or TrxR1b, resulting in a fusion where the GST protein is located at the C terminus of the reductases so that it should not interfere with the LXXLL motif located at the N terminus of the TrxR1. For the construction of GFP fusions the open reading frames of TrxR1a and TrxR1b were amplified with the hTR1 GFP-F1 (5′-GCGGGAGAATTCGCCACCATGGACGGCCCTGAAGATCTTCCCAAG-3′), hTR1 GFP-R1 (5′-GGATGGGGATCCACCGCAGCAGCCAGCC-3′) and KDRF-GFP-F1 (5′-GCGGGAGAATTCGCCACCATGGCATGTGAGGACGGTC-3′), hTR1 GFP-R1 primer pairs, respectively, and cloned into the pEGFP-N3 vector at the EcoRI and BamHI sites. To generate red fluorescent fusion proteins we amplified the open reading frame of HcRed1 with the HcRed5′-BamHI-N3 (5′-AGTTAGGGATCCATGGTGAGCGGCCTGCTGAAGG-3′) and HcRed3′-NotI (5′-CTTGAGCGGCCGCTCAGTTGGCCTTCTCGGGCAGGTC-3′) primers from the pHcRed1-N1 vector and replaced the green fluorescent protein in the pEGFP-N3 by digestion with BamHI and NotI.

Antibody Generation and Western Blotting—Antibodies were generated by the injection of purified TrxR1a or synthesized peptide (KQRKIGGHGPTLKAY) into rabbits. The injection and bleedings were performed by AgriSera, Sweden. Immunoglobulins were precipitated from final bleeding serum by ammonium sulfate. In short, immune serum was diluted 1:1 (5 ml of serum + 5 ml of PBS). For this 10 ml, 2.26 g of ammonium sulfate was added under stirring to precipitate the immunoglobulins. After the addition of ammonium sulfate the sample was further incubated for 2 h on ice with slight stirring. The serum was centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 35,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of PBS and dialyzed extensively against PBS. Antibodies were then subjected to affinity purification against TrxR1a or the synthesized peptide using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The purified antibodies were used for Western blotting. Cell extracts prepared by sonication were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by standard techniques. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) complemented with 10% milk powder. The membrane was incubated with the antibody for 1 h at room temperature in PBS-T with 2% milk powder and subsequently washed 3× 10 min in PBS-T. The antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody and the ECL plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). GST Pull-down Assays—The expression of the TrxR1/GST proteins was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a cell density of A600 = 0.5 for 2 h. The fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to standard protocols. Radiolabeled ERα/β, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and thyroid receptor α (TRα) were produced with the TnT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System according the protocol from Promega. The in vitro translated proteins were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with the TrxR1/GST proteins, bound to GST-Sepharose beads, in pull-down buffer (50 mm potassium Pi, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Tween 20) complemented with 1.5% bovine serum albumin. Ligands (E2, dexamethasone, and T3) were used at a concentration of 1 μm. After incubation, the beads were washed three times for 15 min in pull-down buffer and finally resuspended and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Transfections and GFP Analysis—HEK-293 cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin. The transfection agent used was polyethylenimine (Sigma). 1 μg of DNA was diluted into a final volume of 10 μl of H2O, 0.5 μl of 0.1 m 25-kDa polyethylenimine was added and the sample was vortexed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before it was added to the cells. For luciferase reporter transfections we used 500 ng of the reporter plasmid, 250 ng of pSG5-ERα or -β, and 5 μg of the pIRESneo/TrxR1a or -b or pIRES/Trx1 and used polyethylenimine as the transfection agent. The amount of the DNA was kept constant by the addition of empty pIRESneo vector. For the GFP analysis, cells were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated DNA. After transfection, the cells were kept for 2 days in the presence of ligand, 25 nm E2 or 100 nm ICI 182, 780. Luciferase was measured using the luciferase assay kit from Biothema. The GFP analysis was performed with a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope. For the excitation of the GFP we used the 488-nm laser line and light was collected between 500 and 540 nm, whereas the excitation of HcRed was achieved with the 568-nm laser line and the emitted light was collected between 580 and 640 nm. Both live and fixed cells were used for the localization studies. For fixed cell studies, cells were seeded onto coverslips and transfected after 2 days. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min in room temperature and mounted using FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem). For the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies cells were seeded onto tissue culture dishes for 2 days prior to transfection. Live cells were point bleached by exposing a limited area of the cell to a high intensity laser beam for 30 s using the 488-nm laser line and then images were acquired every 15-30 s. Expression of TrxR1a and -b—Several mRNA splicing variants exist for human TrxR1 (28Osborne S.A. Tonissen K.F. BMC Genomics. 2001; 2: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, their translation results in only two different proteins. One of those, referred to as TrxR1b in this paper, contains an extra 52-amino acid sequence at the N terminus (Fig. 1, A and B). To study the specific expression of TrxR1b we raised an antibody (anti-TrxR1b) against amino acids 28-42 (KQRKIGGHGPTLKAY) within the extra amino acid sequence. The specificity of the anti-TrxR1b was demonstrated with Western blot analysis using extracts from HEK-293 cells transfected with expression plasmids for TrxR1a and -b and with fusions of the TrxRs with GFP. Two Western blots were performed in parallel, one developed with the specific anti-TrxR1b antibody and the other with an anti-TrxR1a antibody (Fig. 1C). An enhanced signal can be seen in the cells transfected with TrxR1b and TrxR1b-GFP, whereas cells transfected with TrxR1a and TrxR1a-GFP had the same signal as the untransfected cells when developed with the TrxR1b antibody. However, in the Western blot developed with the anti-TrxR1a we saw an increased signal in all the transfected cells further confirming the specificity of the anti-TrxR1b antibody as no TrxR1a is detected in the anti-TrxR1b blot (Fig. 1C, lanes TrxR1a and TrxR1a-GFP). The SDS analysis of in vitro translated TrxR1a and TrxR1b is shown in Fig. 1D. To verify the expression of TrxR1b in human tissues we used extracts from different sources. As shown in Fig. 2A, TrxR1b is expressed in all tissues analyzed with particularly high expression in kidney, testis, uterus, ovary, and prostate. We also analyzed the expression of the protein in various cell lines (Fig. 2B). HeLa cells and HT cells express TrxR1b at high levels, whereas the level of expression in the other cell lines was lower. Furthermore, in tissues like testis and kidney as well as in cell lines such as HEK-293, HeLa, and HT, two bands are detected. The lower band seems to be a degradation product from TrxR1b. Even the cells transfected with a construct of TrxR1b give rise to two bands (Fig. 1C) suggesting that the lower band does not represent a product of alternative splicing. It has been demonstrated that the protein can be digested at amino acids 24 and 49 (29Koishi R. Kawashima I. Yoshimura C. Sugawara M. Serizawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2570-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This provides an explanation as to why we sometimes detect two bands. Because our antibody reacts to amino acids 28-42, the protein cleaved at amino acid 24 still contains the crucial amino acids for its detection; when cleaved at amino acid 49, however, the recognition sequence is discarded making the detection of the third expected band impossible. To compare the expression levels of TrxR1a and -b we used a polyclonal antibody raised against TrxR1a. Fig. 2C shows that the antibody can recognize both forms of the protein when cells were transfected with respective expression plasmids. However, in the untransfected and TrxR1a-transfected cells only one band is visible, corresponding to TrxR1a, whereas just a faint shadow is visible at the place one would expect TrxR1b, suggesting that TrxR1a is much more abundant in HEK-293 cells than TrxR1b. This is in accordance with previously reported results where a band of ∼67 kDa copurifies with TrxR1a from human JPX9 cells, however, at significantly lower amounts. In conclusion, the TrxR1b appears to be widely expressed in both human tissues and cell lines and, furthermore, to be specifically cleaved at the N terminus in several tissues and cell lines. TrxR1b Binding to the Estrogen Receptors—The most distinct feature of the extra amino acid sequence in TrxR1b is the presence of an NR box at amino acids 47-51 with the consensus sequence LXXLL (Fig. 1A). The LXXLL motif is present in the majority of nuclear receptor coregulators and is responsible for their binding to their respective nuclear receptor (25Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). The presence of an NR box in TrxR1b raises the question of whether the protein is able to bind to nuclear receptors. A fusion of GST with a peptide comprising amino acids 42-56 of TrxR1b (GSTTrxR1b42-56), including the NR box, was constructed to be used as bait to isolate interacting nuclear receptors. Subsequent GST pull-down experiments showed that both ERs could interact with GST-TrxR1b42-56. Furthermore, this interaction was estrogen dependent (Fig. 3A). Fusions of the entire TrxR1a/b proteins with GST were used to confirm these results. As shown in Fig. 3B, TrxR1b was able to bind both ERs, and the binding was ligand dependent as previously shown for GST-TrxR1b42-56. TrxR1a did not show any binding, confirming that the interaction seen with TrxR1b is dependent on the N-terminal amino acid extension of TrxR1b. Taken together with the fact that the LXXLL peptide from TrxR1b fused to the GST was able to pull-down the ERs, strong evidence is thus provided that the binding is because of the LXXLL motif of TrxR1b. To further confirm the specificity of the binding to the LXXLL motif of TrxR1b a competition pull-down was performed (Fig. 4A). ERα and -β were effectively competed away from the GST-TrxR1b by increasing concentrations of a peptide containing the second NR box of TIF2, which has a strong affinity for the ERs (30Warnmark A. Almlof T. Leers J. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23397-23404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We next examined the specificity of the interaction with ERα/β versus other nuclear receptors. As shown in Fig. 4B, ERα has the strongest binding, with a higher pull-down yield than any other receptors shown. Indeed, GR did not show any binding while TRα interacts, although not with the same strength as observed with ERα. As demonstrated (Fig. 4B), TrxR1b pulls down more than 20% of the ERα input while ∼5% of TRα is bound to the TrxR1b-GST. Taken together, these results indicate that the ERs are strong binding partners for TrxR1b and that the binding is dependent on the presence of the LXXLL motif at the N terminus. Nuclear Colocalization of TrxR1b with ERα/β and Their Sub-nuclear Trafficking—ERα/β and TrxR1a/b reside in different compartments of the cell. ERα/β are localized mainly in the nucleus, whereas TrxR1a/b are mainly cytoplasmic (Fig. 5A) when these proteins are expressed in cells as fusions with GFP and HcRed, respectively. However, we show that, although TrxR1 is mainly a cytoplasmic protein, there are always low amounts of the protein present in the nucleus and ∼5% of the cells have quite substantial amounts, with ∼10% of the total amount of TrxR1a/b protein present in the nucleus (Fig. 5A). When cotransfecting GFP-ERα/β with TrxR1b-HcRed, in the presence of E2, the localization pattern of TrxR1b in the nucleus changes, from mainly a homogeneous distribution to distinct spots colocalizing with ERα/β (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we observed that in the presence of ER and E2, the nuclear localization of TrxR1b would become more pronounced so ∼35% of the cells would have more than 10% of the protein in the nucleus and furthermore, in ∼10% of the cells, it was exclusively in the nucleus; this was not observed without cotransfection. TrxR1a, however, shows the same pattern as when transfected alone (Fig. 5C), i.e. it is mainly cytoplasmic with the nuclear portion of the protein homogeneously distributed in the nucleus with no apparent colocalization with ERα/β. The pull-down experiments revealed that the interaction between TrxR1b and ERs was estrogen dependent, therefore we investigated whether estrogen is important for colocalization of the proteins. For that reason we used the antiestrogen ICI and performed similar transfection experiments as described above. Fig. 5B shows that ICI effectively abolished nuclear colocalization of the ERs and TrxR1b. TrxR1b was no longer restricted to areas of the nucleus where ER was localized but was distributed throughout the entire nucleus. This suggests that the interaction of the ERs and TrxR1b is essential for their colocalization observed in the presence of E2. To obtain quantitative data from the localization studies we analyzed the images and produced graphs of the fluorescent intensity over a certain area of the image, a fluorescence profile. The analysis was performed on the cells shown in Fig. 5B in the presence of either E2 or ICI. As shown in the graphs (Fig. 6) obtained from the cells in the presence of E2, the profile of TrxR1b and ERα/β overlap, whereas in the presence of ICI the TrxR1b fluorescence assumes a more flat profile, no longer resembling the ERα/β distribution, further demonstrating the importance of E2 for the colocalization pattern of the ERs and TrxR1b in the nucleus. However, this interaction does not seem to be necessary for the presence of TrxR1b in the nucleus, because part of the TrxR1b pool is in the nucleus even during ICI treatment (Fig. 5B) as well as in the absence of ERs (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, we were unable to find any cells where ERs and nuclear TrxR1b were not colocalized during E2 treatment. Furthermore, the fact that TrxR1b can be found almost exclusively in the nucleus of cotransfected cells suggests that the ER/TrxR1b interaction, although not essential for nuclear import of TrxR1b, might result in an accumulation of TrxR1b in the nucleus. Hence, both ERα/β and E2 are required for TrxR1b to assume its structured/dotted nuclear pattern seen when colocalized with the ERs as the presence of only ER or E2 alone does not significantly change the cellular pattern of TrxR1b. Furthermore, the presence of the 52 extra amino acid sequence is required as the cellular localization of TrxR1a lacking those extra amino acids was not influenced by the presence of ERs and E2. Using the FRAP technique showed that ERα appears to be very mobile within the nucleus. Furthermore, this mobility is ligand-dependent but also dependent on proteasomes as the use of proteasome inhibitors causes the immobilization of ER (31Stenoien D.L. Patel K. Mancini M.G. Dutertre M. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mancini M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We performed FRAP experiments to further investigate interactions between TrxR1b and the ERs. Live cells cotransfected with ERα and TrxR1b were point bleached in the nucleus and images were captured every 15 s. In the presence of E2, ERα was colocalized with TrxR1b; after bleaching ERα recovers very fast, in a matter of seconds, and the same was true for TrxR1b (Fig. 7). Moreover, when point bleached for longer periods of time, the entire nucleus would become bleached, further confirming the pronounced mobility of both TrxR1 and ERα. Similar results were obtained with cotransfection of ERβ. This demonstrates that both ER and TrxR1b are mobile proteins and that the presence of TrxR1b does not seem to interfere with the dynamic intranuclear behavior of the ER. Effect of TrxR on ER Transcriptional Activity—Because ER appears to relocate TrxR1b in the nucleus to areas where it resides itself we wondered whether TrxR1b could affect the transcriptional activity of ER. Cotransfections of ERα/β with TrxR1a/b were performed and ER transcriptional activity was measured using a luciferase reporter vector under the regulation of an ERE-TATA. In the case of ERα, TrxR1b was capable of enhancing the transcriptional activity of the receptor 2-fold, whereas TrxR1a did not significantly affect ERα activity (Fig. 8A). In the case of ERβ, a 3-fold induction of its transcriptional activity was obtained in the presence of TrxR1b. However, in contrast to ERα, the ERβ activity was also enhanced by TrxR1a in a similar manner to TrxR1b (Fig. 8A). We then examined whether the ERβ activity could be enhanced by the cytosolic Trx as has been demonstrated for ERα (32Hayashi S. Hajiro-Nakanishi K. Makino Y. Eguchi H. Yodoi J. Tanaka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4035-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 8B, Trx1 is a potent inducer of ERβ as it is for ERα, with a 4-fold induction of the ER transcriptional activity, suggesting that ERβ just like ERα can be redox regulated. In addition to the classical ERE-dependent ER pathway, it has been"

Differences in the sensitivity of receptor subtypes to endogenous GABA may permit subunit-dependent finely tuned responsiveness to the same GABAergic inputs. Using both radioligand binding and electrophysiology combined with mutagenesis, we identified a domain of four amino acids within the α subunits that mediates the distinct sensitivities to GABA allowing their selective switch between αβ3γ2 combinations. Replacing this domain in α3 by the corresponding segments of α1–α5 resulted in mutant receptors displaying the GABA EC50 values of the respective wild-type receptors. Vice versa, the α3 motif forced the low sensitivity to GABA of α3 upon α1β3γ2, α4β3γ2, and α5β3γ2. Binding of the GABA agonist [3H]muscimol was not affected by the exchange of the motif between α1 and α3 subunits. Thus, the equilibrium binding pocket is maintained upon replacement of the four amino acids. Taken together our data suggest that the identified motifs contribute to a structure involved in the transduction of the binding signal rather than to the binding itself.

Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system is mediated mainly by the GABAA 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TBPS, t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate; 4aa, four amino acids; TM, transmembrane; MEM, minimum essential medium; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein. receptor, a ligand-gated chloride channel. The receptor complex presumably is composed of five protein subunits, each consisting of an extracellular N-terminal domain with a putative cysteine loop, four largely conserved transmembrane segments (TM), and a variable intracellular region between TM3 and TM4. This topology is characteristic for members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channel receptors (1Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M.

Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Several GABAA receptor subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ϵ, θ, π, ρ1–3) have been cloned from mammalian brain (3Korpi E.R. Gründer G. Lüddens H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 113-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 4Mehta A.K. Ticku M.K. Brain Res. Brain. Res. Rev. 1999; 29: 196-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Thus, the genetic diversity of multiple GABAA receptor subunits permits the assembly of a vast number of receptor heteromeric isoforms. Apparently, the subunit composition determines the pharmacological profile of the resulting receptor subtype (5Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Möhler H. Sieghart W. Biggio G. Braestrup C. Bateson A.N. Langer S.Z. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of the GABAA receptor heterogeneity in the central nervous system remains largely unknown. Most GABAA receptor subunits exhibit distinct regional and cellular distribution throughout the brain, with their expression patterns changing during pre- and postnatal development (6Sieghart W. Sperk G. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 795-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In addition, in neurons expressing different receptor isoforms, a subunit-selective targeting to cellular domains has been observed (7Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Benke D. Fritschy J.M. Somogyi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings further strengthen the notion that the receptor subtypes subserve individual functions in GABAergic neurotransmission. Hence, they may contribute to synaptic variety, as depending on their subunit composition recombinant GABAA receptors differ in their sensitivity to the endogenous agonist GABA (10Ebert B. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Krogsgaard Larsen P. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 957-963PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ducic I. Caruncho H.J. Zhu W.J. Vicini S. Costa E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Especially in view of the existence of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (7Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brickley S.G. Cull-Candy S.G. Farrant M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2960-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a 20-fold difference in GABA sensitivity may play a decisive role in neuronal transmission irrespective of the assumed saturating GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft. Therefore, various GABAA receptor subtypes may allow finely tuned responsiveness to the same GABAergic inputs (14Levitan E.S. Schofield P.R. Burt D.R. Rhee L.M. Wisden W. Kohler M. Fujita N. Rodriguez H.F. Stephenson A. Darlison M.G. Barnard E.A. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1988; 335: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In recombinant ternary receptor complexes the sensitivity to GABA is most apparently influenced by the α subunit, with α3-containing isoforms consistently reported to display the lowest sensitivities of all GABAA receptor subtypes (10Ebert B. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Krogsgaard Larsen P. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 957-963PubMed Google Scholar, 14Levitan E.S. Schofield P.R. Burt D.R. Rhee L.M. Wisden W. Kohler M. Fujita N.

In addition, the GABA-dependent [35S]TBPS binding of α3β3γ2/3 assemblies deviates remarkably from all other subunit combination, that is, high concentrations of GABA are needed to significantly reduce binding of the cage convulsant [35S]TBPS as compared with its respective binding maximum (18Lüddens H. Korpi E.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6957-6962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the deflection point of the concentration-response curves of [35S]TBPS binding for a given subunit combination correlates well with its EC50 value for GABA (18Lüddens H. Korpi E.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6957-6962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these data confirm the low sensitivity of α3-containing receptors and recommend α3 as the starting point to identify molecular determinants of GABA potency in the α subunits. Here we describe the identification and functional characterization of four-amino acid motifs specific for individual α subunits of the GABAA receptor, which control the sensitivity to GABA of the resulting receptor. Exchange between subunits of the whole motif but not of single amino acids resulted in transfer of the respective GABA sensitivities for most receptors of the general composition αiβ3γ2, where i ranges from 1 to 6. Thus, our findings may provide insight into the mechanistic features responsible for the molecular diversity of GABAergic neurotransmission and deliver tools to further dissect the biological significance of GABAA receptor heterogeneity. Construction of Chimeras—The coding strands of the rat GABAA receptor α1 and α3 subunits were excised from expression vectors pRK5-rα1 and pRK5-rα3, respectively, and subcloned into pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Two conserved NcoI restriction sites (Fig. 1) were employed to exchange a 414-bp fragment between α1 and α3, spanning the region from the putative cysteine loop to the TM3. We named the chimeras α1(TM12α3) and α3(TM12α1), respectively, with the characters in parentheses indicating the foreign origin of TM1 and TM2. To generate the chimera α1(TM14)α3 we made use of the XbaI site in the multiple cloning site of pBluescript and the first NcoI site of the coding strand to excise a 590-bp fragment from α1. This fragment was cloned into an α3 construct cut with XbaI and partially digested with NcoI. The final chimera contains the N-terminal part of α1 followed by an α3 stretch extending from the cysteine loop to the C terminus. A reverse chimera, designated α3(TM14)α1, was constructed likewise. Chimeras in which the region preceding the first NcoI restriction site was further subdivided were generated by PCR. We used inner hybrid primers with one half complementary to α1 and the other half complementary to α3. The sequences of these primers were: a31down, 5′-GAAGATCCTTCCACTGAACAACCTGATGG-3′; a31up, 5′-CCATCAGGTTGTTCAGTGGAAGGATCTTC-3′; a13down, 5′-GACAGTGCTCCGGCTGAATAATCTTCTGG-3′; a13up, 5′-CCAGAAGATTATTCAGCCGGAGCACTGTC-3′. The outer primers were either complementary to pRK5 vector sequences for amplification of the 5′ part or hybridized to sequences surrounding the NcoI restriction site in α1 (a1Nco) and α3 (a3Nco), respectively: cis55, 5′-CTCTGCGAGGCAGGTCCAACTGCACCTCGG-3′; a1Nco, 5′-CAGGCATGGGCATCCATGGGAAAGTCTTC-3′; a3Nco, 5′-CAGGCATGCACATCCATGGGGAAATCTTC-3′. In a first series of PCR we used pRK5-rα1 as template with primer pairs cis55/a13up and a31down/a1Nco to generate fragments of 416 and 216 bp in length. Likewise, fragments of 635 and 216 bp were amplified from pRK5-rα3 with primer pairs cis55/a31up and a13down/a3Nco. In a second PCR setting, we mixed the 416-bp α1 fragment with the 216-bp α3 product and combined the 635-bp α3 fragment with the 216-bp amplificat of α1. Because of the partial complementarity of primers a31down/a31up and a13down/a31up, the fragments hybridize at their respective 3′ends and thus allow extension of the double strand by Vent polymerase. The resulting hybrid PCR products were double digested with XbaI and NcoI and cloned into pBluescript-rα3, which had been cut with XbaI and partially digested with NcoI. The chimeras were named rα13-α3 and rα31-α3, respectively. The sequences of all chimeras (Fig. 1) were verified by DNA sequencing and subcloned into expression vector pRK5. Mutagenesis—Eukaryotic expression vectors (pRK5 or pRK7) for the rat GABAA receptor α1–6 subunits (19Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) were used in this study. The desired point mutations and multiple amino acid changes were introduced into the coding strands using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). As applicable we interchanged nucleotides to match human codon preferences for enhanced expression rates in HEK 293 cells. Successful mutagenesis was verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. The following oligonucleotides were used (modified residues are in bold): α3LVDN-ITEDα1, 5′-G CTG CTC AGA ATC ACA GAG GAT GGG ACC CTC C-3′; α3LVDN-IQDDα2, 5′-G CTG CTC AGA ATC CAG GAC GAT GGG ACC CTC C-3′; α3LVDN-IMRNα4, 5′-G CTG CTC AGA ATC ATG CGC AAT GGG ACC CTC C-3′; α3LVDN-LEDD-α5, 5′-G CTG CTC AGA CTG GAG GAC GAT GGG ACC CTC C-3′; α3LVDN-LMQNα6, 5′-G CTG CTC AGA CTG ATG CAG AAT GGG ACC CTC C-3′; α1ITED-LVDNα3, 5′-CTC CTG CGT CTC GTA GAC AAT GGC ACACTG C-3′; α2IQDD-LVDNα3, 5′-G CTG CTT CGA CTC GTG GAT AAT GGA ACA TTG C-3′; α4IMRN-LVDNα3, 5′-CCA AAT AAA CTT TTT AGA CTGGTG GAC AAT GGC ACT ATT TTA TAC-3′; α5LEDD-LVDNα3, 5′-G CTG CTG AGG CTG GTG GAT AAT GGC ACA CTT C-3′; α6LMQN-LVDNα3, 5′-CTC TTC CGA TTG GTG GAT AAT GGA ACG-3′; α3L173Iα1, 5′-G CTG CTC AGA ATC GTA GAC AAT GGG ACC-3′; α3V174Tα1, 5′-G CTG CTC AGA CTG ACC GAC AAT GGG ACC-3′; α3D175Eα1, 5′-G CTC AGA CTG GTA GAG AAT GGG ACC CTC C-3′; α3N176Dα1, 5′-G CTC AGA CTG GTA GAC GAT GGG ACC CTC C-3′; α1T148Vα3, 5′-CTC CTG CGT ATC GTG GAG GAT GGC ACA C-3′. Cell Culturing and Cell Transfection—For electrophysiological recording, HEK 293 cells were passaged and replated on 12-mm glass coverslips located in 9.6-cm plastic dishes; for binding assays, 15-cm plates were employed (numbers given in parentheses refer to quantities used with the latter). They were filled with 10 (or 15) ml of minimum essential medium (MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 158 mg/l sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% O2, 5% CO2 atmosphere for 2–3 (2Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) days. Transfection with recombinant rat GABAA receptors were carried out as described in detail elsewhere (20Korpi E.R. Lüddens H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were transfected using the phosphate precipitation method with rat GABAA receptor cDNAs in eukaryotic expression vectors (pRK5 or pRK7) for the α, β, and γ subunits (19Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). For optimal receptor expression (18Lüddens H. Korpi E.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6957-6962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), final concentrations (μg of vector DNA/9.6-cm (or 15-cm) tissue culture plate) were: α1, 2 (or 5); α2 4.8; α3, 1.2 (or 3); α4, 4; α5, 0.8; α6, 2; β3, 0.4 (or 1); and γ2S, 0.2 (or 0.75). Chimeras and mutants were used in the concentration of the major parental subunit. Wild-type α subunits, α subunit chimeras, and α subunit mutants were cotransfected with the β3 and γ2S subunits. For the identification of transfected cells for electrophysiological recordings, 1 μg/plate pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences) was added. Electrophysiology—Two days after transfection single coverslips containing HEK 293 cells were placed in a recording chamber mounted on the movable stage of a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70) and perfused at room temperature with a defined saline solution containing (in mm): 130 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4, 10 glucose, 5 sucrose, and 10 HEPES (free acid), pH adjusted to 7.35, with about 35 mm NaOH. Transfected cells were identified by their fluorescence (enhanced green fluorescent protein), and ligand-mediated membrane currents of these cells were studied in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15170) Google Scholar). Patch clamp pipettes were pulled from hard borosilicate capillary glass (0.5 mm ID, 1.5 mm OD, Vitrex, Science Products GmbH, Hofheim, Germany) using a horizontal puller (model P-97, Sutter Instruments, CA) in a multi-stage process. The pipettes had an initial resistance of 2–4 megohms when filled with a solution containing (in mm): 90 KCl, 50 KOH, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 3.1 ATP (di-potassium salt), 0.4 GTP (tri-sodium salt), and 10 HEPES (free acid), pH 7.35. The junction potential between the pipette and the external solution was less than 2.3 mV and therefore was disregarded. Seal resistances of >1 gigohm were routinely obtained by applying gentle suction to the pipettes. Membrane rupture was monitored electrically as an increase in capacity. Pipette capacitance, membrane capacitance, and series resistance were compensated for electronically to achieve minimal capacitive transients. A series resistance compensation of >60% was regularly used. Using a fast Y-tube application system, the recombinant receptors were tested at GABA concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60, 100, 300, and 1000 μm. The responses of the cells were recorded by a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-8, HEKA-Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany) in conjunction with a standard personal computer and the pClamp 8.1 software package (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The standard holding potential for the cells was –40 mV. Whole cell currents were low pass-filtered by an eight-pole Bessel filter at 5 or 3 kHz before being digitized by a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon Instruments) and recorded by the computer at a sampling rate of at least 1 kHz. Binding Assays—Resuspended cell membranes (50–200 μg of protein/tube) were incubated in a final volume of 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris citrate buffer, pH 7.3, for [3H]muscimol binding (0.5–30 nm) supplemented with 0.2 m NaCl for [35S]TBPS (6 nm) binding. GABA was diluted from a 100 mm solution in H2O. Nonspecific binding was determined by 100 μm GABA and 20 μm picrotoxinin for [3H]muscimol and [35S]TBPS binding, respectively. After 60 min on ice and 90 min at room temperature ([3H]muscimol and [35S]TBPS, respectively), the assay mixtures were rapidly diluted to 5 ml with ice-cold 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, filtered through glass fiber filters, and washed once with 5 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Filters were immersed in 4 ml of Zinsser Aqua-Solv scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was determined in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external standardization. Statistical calculations were performed using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). GABA Potency of Wild-type αiβ3γ2 Receptors—We transiently expressed ternary rat GABAA receptors in HEK 293 cells configured from any of the six α subunits with the β3 and γ2S variants. Transfected cells were analyzed by whole-cell patch clamping. When expressed in HEK 293 cells, the EC50 of GABA-induced chloride current properties varied with the employed α subunit in a range of <1 to >50 μm in the rank order α6 > α1 > α2 > α4 > α5 ≫ α3 (Table I). Thus we have confirmed the exceptionally low sensitivity to GABA conferred by the α3 subunit.Table IEC50 to GABA of αiβ3γ2 receptors.EC50nμmα1β3γ2S2.9 ± 0.110α2β3γ2S5.2 ± 0.28α3β3γ2S48 ± 210α4β3γ2S7.6 ± 0.37α5β3γ2S11.6 ± 0.57α6β3γ2S1.0 ± 0.038 Open table in a new tab Properties of α1-α3 Chimeric Subunits in [35S]TBPS Binding—To initialize the search for the molecular determinants of GABA potency in the α subunits, we chose the ubiquitous α1as a reference to the α3 subunit and constructed chimeras containing variable segments of each subunit (Fig. 1). We analyzed the GABA-dependent [35S]TBPS binding of these chimeric subunits and compared them with recombinant receptors containing either wild-type α1 or α3 in addition to β3γ2S. [35S]TBPS binding is modulated by most, if not all, compounds interacting with GABAA receptors and can be inhibited by physiologically relevant concentrations of GABA (for review, see Ref. 3Korpi E.R. Gründer G. Lüddens H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 67: 113-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This proved to be true for all chimeric subunits tested, indicating that they were functionally intact. In keeping with previous data (18Lüddens H. Korpi E.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6957-6962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the wild-type receptors, GABA led to a sharp increase in [35S]TBPS binding at concentrations of 1 μm (α1β3γ2S) and 10 μm (α3β3γ2S), respectively (Fig. 2). [35S]TBPS binding to α1β3γ2S was completely abolished by 100 μm GABA, whereas concentrations up to 1 mm GABA did not effectively block [35S]TBPS binding to α3β3γ2S receptors. The properties of the chimeric subunits α1(TM12α3) and α1(TM14α3) were indistinguishable from those of wild-type α1, whereas the values obtained with the α3(TM12α1) chimera resembled those of wild-type α3-containing receptors. The characteristics of chimera rα31-α3, with only 62 amino acids N-terminal of the putative cysteine loop derived from the α1 subunit, were indistinguishable from those of α1. This finding indicates a minor role of both the transmembrane domains and the intracellular loop in determining the α subunit-specific regulation of [35S]TBPS by GABA and predicts the molecular determinants to be localized in this 62-amino acid-long stretch of the α subunits. Functional Properties of α1-α3 Chimeras—To test whether the domains identified by the [35S]TBPS binding technique also determine functional sensitivity to GABA, we recorded GABA-evoked currents of receptors containing the chimeric subunits rα31-α3 or rα13-α3. The dose-response curves to GABA were indistinguishable for α3β3γ2S and (rα13-α3)β3γ2S receptors (data not shown), with an EC50 for GABA of 48 ± 2 and 51 ± 3 μm, respectively. Likewise, the differences in the EC50 values of α1β3γ2S and (rα31-α3)β3γ2S, 2.9 ± 0.1 and 3.1 ± 0.1 μm, respectively, were insignificant, proving that in α1 and α3 the molecular determinants of GABA sensitivity and those affecting modulation of [35S]TBPS binding by the neurotransmitter are located within the same region of the extracellular N-terminal domain. Moreover, the apparent characteristics of the two subunits are transferable by exchange of the short segment between α1 and α3. These findings warranted further dissection of this segment to pin down the decisive amino acid residues. The sequence identity of α1 and α3 in this stretch of 62 amino acids is 87%, and thus a maximum of 8 amino acid residues could cause the functional characteristics. Based on the assumption that the particular low sensitivity conferred by the α3 subunit is due to a unique structural feature, we aligned the 62-amino acid stretch of all α subunits (Fig. 3). The α3 subunit differs in only two positions from all other α subunits, i.e. Val174 and His188 (relating to the unequivocal numbering of the unprocessed protein), recommending both as prime candidates for subsequent mutagenesis studies. Single Amino Acids Are Involved but Are Insufficient to Determine the Sensitivity to GABA—Using site-directed mutagenesis we substituted His188 in α3 for the corresponding arginine of α1. Expression of the mutant α3H188R subunit together with β3γ2S did not alter the sensitivity of the resulting receptors to GABA (data not shown), i.e. the EC50 value and the Hill coefficient were identical to those of wild-type α3β3γ2S. Like-wise, the dose response to GABA of receptors containing the reverse mutant α1R162H was indistinguishable from that of the α1β3γ2S assemblies. To examine the impact of α3Val174 on the sensitivity to GABA, we mutated this residue into its α1 corresponding amino acid, threonine. Fig. 4 illustrates the effect on the GABA sensitivity of the resulting α3V174Tβ3γ2S receptors with the dose-response curve of α3V174Tβ3γ2S being intermediate between the wild-type α1- and α3-containing receptors but with an increase in ligand-induced current at the highest concentration of GABA employed (1 mm). Therefore, residue Val174 in α3 can be considered a necessary determinant of the GABA sensitivity although insufficient to convert the α3 subunit into a subunit with the characteristics of α1, thus predicting additional factors. We therefore mutated the neighboring amino acids Leu173, Asp175, and Asn176 into their α1 counterparts isoleucine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid, respectively. When expressed together with β3 and γ2S, α3D175E was indistinguishable from wild-type α3, whereas the EC50 values for GABA of α3L173I and α3N176D were slightly decreased to 15 ± 1 and 18 ± 2 μm, respectively (Fig. 4). However, the EC50 values of α1-containing receptors were not achieved by any of these mutant subunits. Individual Four-amino Acid Motifs Determine the GABA Sensitivity of the α Subunits—From the sequence alignment of the α subunits and the above cited results it became apparent that α3 Leu173, Val174, and Asn176 are part of a four-amino acid (4aa) motif highly variable between the six subunits. The variability appeared even more significant because of the conserved residues flanking the motif N- and C-terminally. We therefore proceeded to exchange the complete motif between α1 and α3. Replacement of the 4aa motif between the α1 for the α3 subunits had a tremendous effect on the sensitivity to GABA. When substituting residues LVDN in α3 by α1ITED, the dose-response curve of the mutant receptor subtype α3ITEDβ3γ2S shifted to the left (Fig. 5A), resulting in the same EC50 to GABA of wild-type α1- and mutant α3-containing receptors (2.9 ± 0.1 and 3.2 ± 0.1 μm for α1 and α3ITED, respectively). The opposite effect was obtained with the converse mutant α1LVDN, as both the dose-response curve (Fig. 5A) and the EC50 (48 ± 2 and 55 ± 2 μm for wild-type and mutant receptors, respectively) to GABA were identical to those of the wild-type α3β3γ2S receptors. Thus, exchange of the 4aa motif resulted in a complete transfer of the GABA sensitivities from α1 upon α3 and vice versa (Table I, Fig. 5A). In subsequent experiments we tested in detail our hypothesis that the 4aa motif is the general determinant of GABA sensitivity in all α subunits. To this end we substituted LVDN derived from α3 for IQDD (α2), IMRN (α4), LEDD (α5), and LMQN (α6), as well as the 4aa of α2, α4, α5, and α6 for LVDN of α3. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the introduction of LVDN (α3) into α4 and α5 resulted in mutant receptors both displaying the EC50 for GABA of α3β3γ2S (Table I). Likewise, we were able to force the higher sensitivities for GABA conferred by the α4 and α5 subunits upon the α3β3γ2S receptor by mutating the original LVDN residues into the 4aa motifs derived from the α4 or α5 sequences (Fig. 5, B and C, and Table I). When expressing β3γ2S together with α3IQDD, the dose-response curve of the resulting receptors did not differ from that of α2β3γ2S (Fig. 6A, Table I). Introducing the LVDN motif of α3 into the α2 sequence had a remarkable effect on the GABA potency, as the sensitivity for GABA of α2LVDNβ3γ2S assemblies was reduced more then 1000-fold. As the dose-response curve of the mutant receptor complex did not even plateau at the highest GABA concentration tested, the EC50 could only be extrapolated to 5 mm (Fig. 6A). The dose-response curve for GABA of the mutant subunit α6LVDNβ3γ2S shifted in the direction of the dose-response curve of wild-type α3β3γ2S (Fig. 6B, Table I), resulting in an EC50 value of α6LVDN containing receptors 2.5-fold higher than of wild-type α6 receptors. The reverse mutant α3LMQNβ3γ2S was the only receptor of all wild-type and mutant GABAA subunit assemblies tested that exhibited a biphasic response to GABA with EC50 values of 1.7 ± 0.4 μm for the high affinity and 101 ± 56 μm for the low affinity site (Fig. 6B). Thus, both values were double the magnitude of the α6 and α3 wild type-containing receptors, respectively. The fraction of the high affinity site was determined to be 63 ± 5%. Based on the F-score (F1,12 = 10.97), the two-site fit was statistically superior to that of the Hill equation (p = 0.006). In our hands, β3 and β3γ2S alone did not form functional channels (data not shown). Thus, we can exclude any contribution of homomeric β3 receptors or β3γ2S receptors to the biphasic nature of the α3LMQNβ3γ2S dose-response curve. Equilibrium Binding of [3H]Muscimol Is Not Affected by the 4aa Motif in α1 and α3—We measured the binding displacement of 6 nm [3H]muscimol by GABA from wild-type and selected mutant α1 and α3 subunits coexpressed with the β3 and γ2S subunits (Fig. 7). The GABAA receptor agonist [3H]muscimol selectively labels the high affinity binding site. The IC50 values conferred by the mutant subunits α3V174T and α1T148V were indistinguishable from those of the underlying wild-type α subunits. The same held true for mutant subunits α3ITED and α1LVDN, respectively. Thus, displacement of neither the single amino acid residue nor the 4aa motif influenced the equilibrium binding parameters of the resulting receptors, indicating that the depicted segment does not contribute to the high affinity agonist binding site. The structural heterogeneity of GABAA receptors is widely accepted, but the physiological significance of the receptor variety in vivo remains enigmatic, especially as there are no known endogenous analogues for most psychoactive drugs modulating GABAergic inputs. The fact that many receptor subtypes can be distinguished by their respective sensitivity to GABA in vitro argues strongly that differential expression of at least the α subunits influences the neuronal responsiveness to this neurotransmitter in vivo. Thus, an array of different subunit isoforms would allow an adjustment to varying GABAergic inputs as well as differing responses to uniform signals (14Levitan E.S. Schofield P.R. Burt D.R. Rhee L.M.

To determine the membrane's role in regulating transport we describe here the first measurements of the intracellular (unbound) FFA concentration ([FFAi]) and their use in monitoring transport of FFA across 3T3F442A adipocytes. [FFAi] was measured by microinjecting cells with ADIFAB, a fluorescently labeled fatty acid-binding protein that is used to measure unbound FFA levels.

[FFAo] was clamped at defined levels using complexes of FFA and bovine serum albumin. We show that FFA influx is slow, requiring about 300 s to reach steady state (rate constant ∼ 0.02 s-1) and saturable (Ko ∼ 200 nm). Efflux is twice as fast as influx, for zero [FFAo], but decreases with increasing [FFAo]. Surprisingly, at steady state [FFAi] is 2–5-fold (average 2-fold) greater than [FFAo] and this [FFAi]/[FFAo] gradient is abolished by depleting cellular ATP. Our results indicate that FFA transport across adipocyte membranes is highly regulated, involving an ATP-driven pump and a mechanism for gating efflux that is sensitive to [FFAo]. These characteristics are well described by a membrane carrier model but are not consistent with FFA transport across the membrane's lipid phase.

Evidence from a number of studies has yielded two essentially contradictory mechanisms of FFA transport. One view envisions FFA transport as a rapid diffusive process across the lipid bilayer phase of the membrane, in which the rate-limiting step is dissociation from rather than translocation across the membrane (6Zakim D.

Sci. 1996; 93: 10139-10144Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Kamp F. Guo W. Souto R. Pilch P.F. Corkey B.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol.

Identification of FFA transport proteins derive from measurements of FFA uptake, in which the time course is determined for the association of radio- or fluorescently labeled FFA with adipocytes (11Schaffer J.E.

Transport across the plasma membrane involves the movement of FFA from the extracellular aqueous phase to the cytoplasmic aqueous phase, as well as the reverse process. Elucidation of the steps involved in the process would optimally be done by monitoring directly the time course of the intracellular aqueous phase concentration ([FFAi]) following changes in extracellular concentration ([FFAo]). Such measurements have not been reported for FFA transport in cells. We have previously developed methods for encapsulating ADIFAB in lipid vesicles and red cell ghosts and used these systems for studying FFA transport (16Kleinfeld A.M. Chu P. Romero C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14146-14158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Kleinfeld A.M. Storms S. Watts M.

In this report we have extended these methods by injecting ADIFAB into 3T3F442A adipocytes. We have used ratio fluorescence microscopy to image [FFAi] and thereby determined the characteristics of FFA transport across adipocytes. The results of these direct measurements of FFA transport indicate a much more complex and highly regulated transport mechanism in adipocytes than expected from previous studies. Buffering [FFAo]—[FFAo] was buffered by FFA:BSA complexes formed by titrating with sodium salts of the FFA (Nu-Chek Prep) solutions of 600 μm BSA (fatty acid free from Sigma) in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgSO4 at pH 7.4 (C-HEPES). The titration was done by adding multiple 40–70-μl aliquots of a 50 mm solution of FFA in 4 mm NaOH to a stirred BSA solution at 37 °C. The palmitate stock solution was maintained above 70 °C during preparation of complexes. The FFA:BSA complexes were stored at -20 °C. The unbound FFA concentration ([FFAu]) for each complex was determined using the fluorescent probe ADIFAB (FFA Sciences) as described previously (19Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—3T3F442A adipocytes were prepared as described by Green and Kehinde (21Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Adherent adipocytes were removed using trypsin/EDTA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and seeded at ∼105 cells on to 24 × 40 mm microscope cover slips. The cover slips were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml insulin for 18–96 h before use. Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence images were obtained using a Nikon diaphot inverted fluorescence microscope fitted with filter wheels (Sutter) containing 20 nm band pass filters (Omega Optical) and a cooled CCD camera with a backed thinned sensor (Princeton Instruments). Most images were obtained with a Nikon Fluor 40 × 1.3 NA objective. Cell-seeded coverslips were mounted in a heated perfusion chamber (Warner) to maintain the cells between 34 and 37 °C and unless stated otherwise all experiments were performed in this temperature range. Single cells were microinjected (Eppendorf) with 400 μm ADIFAB in C-HEPES and fluorescence images were recorded at 435 and 505 nm upon excitation at 380 nm. MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging) was used to log and form 505 nm/435 nm ratio (R) images. Fluorescence images were captured with typical exposure times of 100 ms and acquisition intervals of 15–60 s. Photobleaching of ADIFAB causes an upward drift in R value, which was minimized by limiting exposure time and placing neutral density filters in the excitation path. The R value for each pixel in the image was calculated by subtracting from the 505 and 435 nm ADIFAB intensities within the cell a background intensity obtained from areas containing no cells. This background was less than 10% and autofluorescence from cells without ADIFAB was less than 5% and was ignored in determining the R value. R values averaged over >50% of the cell area were used for determination of transport characteristics. The images were obtained by focusing in the center of these rather thick cells (10–20 μm), and therefore the edges of the cells were generally not in focus. As a consequence R value determinations and the false color images in these narrow regions are not reliable and were not used in determining transport characteristics. Images acquired with BCECF (Molecular Probes) were excited at 440 and 485 nm and emission was recorded at 530 nm while for Magnesium Green (Molecular Probes) excitation was at 485 nm, and images were recorded at 530 nm. Transport Measurements—Up to 10 cells in the microscope field were microinjected with ADIFAB. Cells were incubated with fatty acid-free BSA (FAFBSA) to reduce endogenous FFA, washed with C-HEPES to remove excess BSA, and then FFA:BSA was added to initiate influx. Exchanging buffers and mixing required ∼10 s. After [FFAi] reached steady state, the FFA:BSA (600 μm BSA) was changed to FAFBSA, which triggered efflux. This cycle could be repeated more than four times on the same cells with consistent results. The C-HEPES with FFA:BSA used in each transport cycle was saved and its [FFAo] was determined fluorometrically with ADIFAB (20Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the highly buffered conditions of this study (600 μm BSA), [FFAo] was virtually unchanged during transport. The ADIFAB response measured with the fluorescence microscope was calibrated by measuring R for 4 μm ADIFAB titrated with oleate:BSA complexes whose free oleate concentrations ranged from 10 to 700 nm. An analogous procedure was performed fluorometrically to yield the condition: R(microscope) ≈3 × R (fluorometer). [FFAi] was determined for all FFA investigated using the above relationship and the fluorometric calibrations of ADIFAB for other FFA (19Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The volume of ADIFAB microinjected and, therefore [ADIFABi], differed from cell to cell by as much as 300%, as indicated by the fluorescence intensity at 435 nm (data not shown). However, [FFAi] determined from the ratio of ADIFAB intensities revealed no correlation with fluorescence intensities in ATP replete or depleted cells. The time course of FFA dissociation from plasma membranes was determined by monitoring the FFA-mediated decrease in BSA tryptophan fluorescence after stopped flow mixing with oleate loaded plasma membranes (18Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Bichemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were isolated from 3T3F442A cells as described previously (22Storch J. Shulman S.L. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10527-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP and pHiAssays—ATP was depleted by incubating cells in 10 μg/ml oligomycin (Sigma) and 37 mm deoxyglucose (Sigma) in C-HEPES buffer without glucose (d-HEPES), for ∼50 min. Greater than 90% ATP depletion was confirmed for adipocytes in suspension with the ENLITEN ATP Assay (Promega). Decreases in intracellular ATP were confirmed for adherent adipocytes by measuring cytosolic [Mg2+] in situ (23Leyssens A. Nowicky A.V. Patterson L. Crompton M. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with Magnesium Green. Cells were incubated in 5 μg/ml of the cell permeable Magnesium Green AM for 45 min, washed, and then incubated in C-HEPES for 30 min before use. Because ATP has a higher affinity than ADP for Mg2+, increases in cytosolic Mg2+ are consistent with a decrease in intracellular ATP. The average ± S.E. increase ([Mg2+] increases as ATP decreases) in the Magnesium Green intensities upon ATP depletion was 51 ± 6% (n = 18). We also measured, in 3 separate experiments, Magnesium Green intensities in cells that were microinjected with ADIFAB to determine whether FFAi levels in different cells were consistent with their ATPi levels. This determination is subject to additional uncertainties compared with a ratio probe such as ADIFAB, because Magnesium Green intensities reflect, in addition to the cell'sMg2+ level, the intracellular concentration of the probe and the uniformity of the illumination field in the microscope. Intracellular pH (pHi) changes in adherent adipocytes were monitored using BCECF (Molecular Probes). Adherent adipocytes were incubated in 0.5 μm BCECF AM for 30 min and washed with C-HEPES before use. The intracellular BCECF response was calibrated by measuring the fluorescence ratio when loaded cells were exposed to buffers of varying pH in the presence of nigericin (Sigma). Procedures for Modifying 3T3F442A Cells—Cells were treated to inhibit acyl-CoA synthetase by incubation with 10–100 μm Triacsin C (BIOMOL) for up to 2 h prior to transport measurements. For studies of the effect of 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) (Molecular Probes), cells were incubated for 30 and 60 min in 200 μm DIDS prior to transport measurements. Cells appeared contracted after incubation, but transport characteristics were unaffected. Phloretin (ICN) was prepared in C-HEPES with and without OA:BSA complexes or FAFBSA. Phloretin was used at 250 or 500 μm for transport and studies of its interactions with BSA and ADIFAB. Effects of trypsin were assessed by incubating cells in 1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min in C-HEPES. This treatment caused the cells to contract but had no effect on transport. Carrier Model—We have constructed a carrier model of FFA transport by converting the simple, symmetric, four state model of Weiss (24Weiss T.F. Cellular Biophysics. 1st Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1996: 360-386Google Scholar) to one that is asymmetric. In this model the rate of change of the intracellular unbound FFA is expressed as the difference between influx and efflux shown in Equation 1.d[FFAi]/dt=Roi×[FFAo]/([FFAo]+Ko)−Rio×[FFAi]/([FFAi]+Ki)(Eq. 1) The maximum influx and efflux rates are Roi = Co × koi and Rio = CiF × kioF + CiS × kioS, Co and Ci = CiF + CiS are concentrations of the carriers at the extracellular and intracellular surfaces, respectively. F and S refer to the fast and slow states of the efflux carrier and the proportion of these states are determined by [FFAo] and the dissociation constant for binding to the efflux gate by Kg = CiF × [FFAo]/CiS. The carrier translocation rate constants are koi, kioF, and kioS and Ko and Ki are the dissociation constants for FFA binding to the carriers at the extra- and intracellular surfaces. Only the translocation steps are considered in this model because the off-rate constant (koff) is about 100-fold faster than either the influx or efflux rate constants and, under the conditions of this study, in which [FFAo] is buffered, the rate constant for binding is slightly less than koff (18Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Bichemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The model's parameters were determined by a least squares fit (MLAB, Civilized Software) to the [FFA] dependence of the influx, efflux and [FFAi]/[FFAo] measurements. FFA Transport Measured by Imaging [FFAi]—We have adopted a fluorescence ratio microscopy approach to image [FFAi], using methods similar to those used to image intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations (25Tsien R.Y. Poenie M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 450-455Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (357) Google Scholar). 3T3F442A adipocytes were microinjected with ADIFAB, the fluorescent probe of FFAu (19Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phase contrast microscopy reveals the discrete lipid droplets characteristic of 3T3F442A cells (Fig. 1A, panel 1). Fluorescence images were recorded at 435 and 505 nm. The ratio of the image intensities at 505 and 435 nm were used to determine [FFAi] and are represented using a false color scale (Fig. 1A, panels 2–8). Although not clearly visible in these ratio images, the fluorescence images at 435 or 505 nm reveal that ADIFAB fluorescence is uniformly distributed within the cytosol but excluded from the lipid droplets. The images of Fig. 1A are snapshots acquired during the course of a typical transport cycle. [FFAi] values, averaged over the major portion of the intracellular volume, for the entire transport cycle are shown in Fig. 1B. To measure transport, cells were first perfused with FAFBSA, which clamped [FFAo] at zero. At the end of this period cells were washed with C-HEPES to remove FAFBSA and thereafter, from about 500–750 s, [FFAi] remained constant at about 10 nm (Fig. 1B). Influx was initiated by exchanging buffer without BSA for buffer containing oleate:BSA complexes for which [FFAo] was 160 nm (Fig. 1, A, panel 2 and B, 2). After initiating influx, [FFAi] rose to steady state in about 300 s, yielding an influx rate constant (kin) of about 0.02 s-1 and a steady state concentration of 470 nm. After steady state was reached, efflux was initiated by exchanging buffer containing oleate:BSA for buffer with FAFBSA (Fig. 1, A, panel 6 and B, 6). At this point [FFAi] returned rapidly to baseline yielding an efflux rate constant (kout) of about 0.04 s-1, about twice kin. This cycle of influx and efflux could be repeated more than four times on the same cells with consistent results. These transport measurements are representative of more than 500 such measurements. An ATP-dependent Mechanism Generates a Concentration Gradient with [FFAi] > [FFAo]—Surprisingly, these measurements reveal that steady state [FFAi] values are significantly greater than [FFAo] (Figs. 1B and 2). Results for different cells in the same field reveal significant heterogeneity in the [FFAi]/[FFAo] gradient. For example, the 4 cells of Fig. 2 reveal [FFAi]/[FFAo] values that range between 1 and 2. In some instances (not shown) we have observed gradients as large as 5, although the average is about 2. Measurements before and after ATP depletion reveal that the [FFAi]/[FFAo] gradient as well as the cell to cell heterogeneity is abolished by ATP depletion without affecting influx or efflux rate constants (Fig. 2). Results from experiments in which [FFAi] was measured in cells labeled with Magnesium Green reveal between 3 and 60% [FFAi] decrease per percent Magnesium Green intensity increase (data not shown). These results are consistent, within the constraints of this method (“Experimental Procedures”), with a cell to cell decrease in [FFAi] with decreasing [ATPi]. Together, these results suggest that an ATP-driven pump is involved in FFA influx and that heterogeneity of [FFAi] at steady state is linked to [ATPi] heterogeneity. Efflux Is Regulated by an [FFAo] Sensing Gate—The finding of [FFAi] ≥ [FFAo] and efflux rate constants that are about 2-fold greater than influx would appear to be contradictory because for these rate constants [FFAi] should be less than [FFAo]/2. However, these rate constants were determined using elevated [FFAo] for influx and zero [FFAo] for efflux (Fig. 1B). We therefore investigated whether the efflux rate constant might be a function of [FFAo] so that kout would decrease with increasing [FFAo]. Such measurements indicate that indeed, kout decreases by about 2–3-fold for [FFAo] above 10 nm (Fig. 3). Thus for [FFAo] significantly greater than normal (<4 nm) plasma levels (26Richieri G.V. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Apple F.S. Kleinfeld A.M. Adams J.E. Clin. Proteomics. 2004; 1: 41-44Crossref Google Scholar) the rate of efflux switches from greater than to about equal to the influx rate, which together with the effect of ATP allows [FFAi] ≥ [FFAo]. Influx Is Saturable—An ATP-mediated FFA pump and gated efflux suggest that a membrane carrier protein facilitates FFA transport. In this event the initial rate of transport should saturate with increasing [FFAo]. We therefore measured the [FFAo] dependence of the initial influx rate of oleate, and the results indicate saturation with a carrier binding constant of about 200 nm (Fig. 4A). A carrier model also predicts (see “Discussion”) that after peaking at an [FFAo] of about 30 nm,as a consequence of the efflux gate, the [FFAi]/[FFAo] gradient should decrease with increasing [FFAo] because the number of carriers is finite. The results shown in Fig. 4B confirm this prediction. Transport Rates Are Independent of the Type of Long Chain FFA—In addition to oleate (18:1), influx, and efflux time courses were measured using palmitate (16:0), linoleate (18:2), linolenate (18:3), and arachidonate (20:4). All these FFA revealed quite similar, within about 70%, influx and efflux rate constants and for all five FFA kout was about twice kin (Fig. 5A). In addition, all the FFA revealed significant steady state [FFAi] > [FFAo] gradients, with a possible trend toward larger values for the polyunsaturated FFA (Fig. 5B). The similarity of influx and efflux rate constants for the different FFA contrasts sharply with the large (>7-fold) differences in rates of transport and/or dissociation rates observed for these same FFA in lipid membranes (16Kleinfeld A.M. Chu P. Romero C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14146-14158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Zhang F. Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16055-16060Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Massey J.B. Bick D.H. Pownall H.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1732-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These results indicate a distinctly different FFA transport mechanism in adipocytes than for lipid vesicles. Translocation Is the Rate-limiting Step for Transport—Influx and efflux measurements do not themselves indicate which step in transport is rate-limiting. Influx involves: 1) dissociation from BSA, 2) transfer of FFA from the aqueous phase to the membrane, 3) translocation across the membrane, and 4) dissociation from the membrane into the aqueous phase. In our transport measurements [FFAo] is tightly buffered by the high concentrations (600 μm) of BSA used in the FFA:BSA complexes. Under these conditions transfer of FFA from albumin to the membrane occurs in less than 0.2 s and therefore dissociation from BSA is not rate-limiting (18Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Bichemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine if the membrane dissociation step is rate-limiting we measured oleate transfer from 3T3F442A plasma membranes to BSA, monitoring the decrease in BSA tryptophan fluorescence caused by oleate binding (18Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Bichemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The results reveal a fast component with a rate constant of 1.7 s-1 that comprises 80% of the transfer amplitude (Fig. 6). The fast rate is similar to dissociation from lipid vesicles and red cell ghosts (17Kleinfeld A.M. Storms S. Watts M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8011-8019Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Bichemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Massey J.B. Bick D.H. Pownall H.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1732-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the 80% amplitude is consistent with dissociation from these mostly unsealed membranes. A second component, comprising about 20% of the decrease in BSA fluorescence and having a rate constant of about 0.1 s-1, may reflect translocation across the plasma membrane of a small fraction of sealed vesicles. Together with the much slower influx/efflux rate constants in whole cells, the rapid dissociation from the membranes is consistent with translocation as the rate-limiting step for transport across 3T3F442A cells. Additional evidence for slow translocation was obtained by monitoring the decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) upon addition of oleate to 3T3F442A cells containing the pH sensing fluorophore BCECF. The measurements were performed using the same conditions as for influx in cells containing ADIFAB. The rate constant determined from the decrease in pHi in response to extracellular oleate was virtually identical to that determined with ADIFAB (Fig. 7). Together, the dissociation and pHi measurements indicate that translocation is rate-limiting for FFA transport across 3T3F442A adipocytes. These results indicate that the transported species is the protonated FFA. This is also consistent with our finding that the anionic FFA, hexadecanesulfonate, is not transported (data not shown). Although ADIFAB responds well to hexadecanesulfonate when mixed together and monitored fluorometrically, intracellular ADIFAB does not respond to the addition of extracellular hexadecanesulfonate. Accuracy of the ADIFAB Determination of [FFAi]—It is critical for our interpretation of the ADIFAB response that its calibration is valid in the intracellular environment of the 3T3F442A cells. Support for the accuracy of [FFAi] values derived from the ADIFAB response is the equality of [FFAi] and [FFAo] in ATP-depleted cells, for example Fig. 2. To help further ensure the accuracy of the ADIFAB response we investigated whether intracellular pH or long chain acyl-CoA might significantly alter the ADIFAB response. Reducing pHi was reported to slow dissociation from adipocyte membranes (30Trigatti B.L. Gerber G.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and because the affinity for ADIFAB increases with decreasing pH (31Richieri G.V. Kleinfeld A.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), high ADIFAB readings might reflect low pHi rather than high [FFAi]. The influx rate constant determined by monitoring pHi (Fig. 7), which does not require FFA dissociation, and that determined by ADIFAB are virtually identical, indicating that the pHi, even with the decrease due to FFA transport, does not reduce the dissociation rate significantly. In addition, rate constants and the [FFAi] > [FFAo] gradient, were unaffected by treating cells with nigericin which clamped pHi to pHo (7.4) (data not shown). We conclude that changes in pHi under the conditions of our transport measurements have a negligible effect on transport rates or steady state [FFAi] levels. Long chain acyl-CoA was reported to bind ADIFAB (32Jolly C.A. Hubble T. Be"

Previous reports demonstrate that murine p19ARF cooperates with p53 in the cellular response to gamma irradiation. Here, we show that endogenous ARF sequentially interacts with p53 and MDM2 following irradiation of primary human and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Shortly after irradiation, p14ARF binds p53 independently of MDM2. As nuclear pools of p53 decline, endogenous p14ARF co-immunoprecipitates with MDM2 and is localized within the nucleolus. Interestingly, p14ARF nucleolar localization during this response is abrogated in cells lacking functional p53. Taken together, our data suggest that human and murine ARF contribute to the mammalian DNA damage response."

STAT6-deficient mice underlined the importance of this factor in gene expression and Th cell differentiation, and indicated that most IL-4-mediated functions are lost in the absence of STAT6 (5Kaplan M.H.

In addition, the use of ectopic expression of STAT6 variants in cells have also emphasized its role in transcription regulation. The IL-4-induced expression of IL-13 Rα2 receptor chain and eotaxin-3 have been shown clearly to depend on STAT6 activation (8David M. Ford D. Bertoglio J. Maizel A.L. Pierre J.

Among these regulators SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) proteins have been described as negatively regulating the JAK/STAT pathway. There are at least eight members of the SOCS family, each of which contains a central SH2 domain, an amino-terminal domain of variable length and divergent sequence, and a carboxyl-terminal 40-amino acid module that is known as the SOCS-box (11Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Generally, these proteins are not highly expressed in unstimulated tissues but are induced by stimulation. SOCS proteins regulate the magnitude and duration of responses triggered by various cytokines by inhibiting their signal transduction pathway in a classical negative feedback loop (13Alexander W.S.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, SOCS proteins have been shown to bind directly to cytokine receptors or to the catalytic domain of JAK kinases and therefore impede the recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT (16Gadina M.

Although the role of SOCS-1 in modulating cytokine signaling has been extensively studied, less is known about the mechanisms that control Socs-1 gene expression. Numerous studies have implicated STAT protein family members in the positive regulation of Socs gene expression (20Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 21Verdier F. Rabionet R. Gouilleux F. Beisenherz-Huss C. Varlet P. Muller O. Mayeux P. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Chretien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). More recently, after erythropoietin stimulation a positive and negative regulation of Socs-1 and Socs-3 gene expression has been reported implicating STAT5 in erythropoietin-responsive cell lines (22Jegalian A.G. Wu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2345-2352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Socs-1 expression is also controlled through translational repression (23Schluter G. Boinska D. Nieman-Seyde S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Gregorieff A. Pyronnet S. Sonenberg N. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21596-21604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, transcriptional silencing of Socs-1 gene by hypermethylation was frequently observed in certain cancer cells (25Yoshikawa H. Matsubara K. Qian G.S. Jackson P. Groopman J.D. Manning J.E. Harris C.C. Herman J.G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 29-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Galm O. Yoshikawa H. Esteller M. Osieka R. Herman J.G. Blood. 2003; 101: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Socs-1 expression is up-regulated by numerous cytokines and growth factors, among which is IL-4 (17Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 27Federici M. Giustizieri M.L. Scarponi C. Girolomoni G. Albanesi C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and is also able to inhibit IL-4 signal transduction (28Losman J.A. Chen X.P. Hilton D. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3770-3774PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we report on the mechanism by which IL-4 regulates Socs-1 expression in human keratinocytes. The establishment of cell lines expressing either a gain-of-function or a transcriptional dominant negative form of STAT6 allowed us to investigate the role of STAT6 in the regulation of SOCS-1 mRNA expression. Moreover, we have cloned the 5′-flanking region of Socs gene and defined its promoter region which contains three STAT6-binding element (SBE). We then provide evidence that STAT6 binding to its distal SBE in the Socs-1 promoter was critical for IL-4-mediated Socs-1 expression. Furthermore, we report that the distal SBE is a composite element, which allows the binding of both STAT6 and Ets transcription factors. These two transcription factors are associated within the cells and transient transfection indicated a cooperation between these two unrelated transcription factors. Altogether these data argue for a novel transcription factor interaction mechanism that may account for SOCS-1 mRNA regulation of expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (29Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3427) Google Scholar) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics (50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin), with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal calf serum.Cytokine, Antibodies, and Reagents—Human recombinant IL-4, kindly provided by Dr P. Ferrara (Sanofi, France), was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Anti-STAT6 (S-20), anti-Ets1/2 (C-275), and anti-RNA pol II (N-20) polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz. Anti-Phospho-STAT6 (Tyr-641) polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Anti-Ets antisera directed against Ets-1/2 (number 8), Ets-1 (number 41), and Ets-2 (number 38) were a generous gift of Dr. J. Ghysdael. c-DNA corresponding to hemagglutinin (HA)-p51-Ets-1 was a generous gift of Dr. F. Soncin.PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer and quantified at 260 nm. Total RNA was treated with DNase from Ambion. 2 μg of total cellular RNA was reverse-transcribed using a (dT) oligomer primer and 2 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and then used as template for PCR. The specific primers corresponding to the region +919/+1241 of the SOCS-1 c-DNA were 5′-CACGCACTTCCGCACATTCC (forward) and 5′-TCCAGCAGCTCGAAGAGGCA (reverse). PCRs were carried out with 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) and 5% of Me2SO during 35 cycles of successive incubations at 94 °C (for 30 s), at 55 °C (for 1 min), and at 72 °C (for 1 min). PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel. Real time PCR was performed using a Light Cycler. 1 μl of reverse transcription was amplified with the Socs-1-specific primers and 28S specific primers. Results obtained with SOCS-1-specific primers were normalized against 28S.Plasmids Constructs—The construct encoding FLAG-STAT6 was generated from pCMV-Tag1-STAT6 (8David M. Ford D. Bertoglio J. Maizel A.L. Pierre J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6660-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The pCMV-Tag1-STAT6 was cut with NheI and HpaI and inserted into the same site in pIRESneo vector (Clontech). The double mutant STAT6VT was prepared by introducing two alanine residues at amino acid positions 547 and 548 (30Daniel C. Salvekar A. Schindler U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14255-14259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The STAT6ΔC was prepared by a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain at position 661. The correct nucleotide sequences of PCR products and cloning junctions were verified by DNA sequencing.For the construct encoding the Socs-1 promoter, HaCaT cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.08 mg/ml proteinase K overnight at 55 °C. The Socs-1 promoter P1 was generated with a forward primer 5′-CGATGGTACCTTTCTTCCCGAGCCGGGTAG and a reverse primer 5′-ACGTAAGCTTGCGCATGCTCCGGGGCCAGG. The Socs-1 promoter P2 was generated with the same reverse primer and a forward primer 5′-ACGTGGTACCGAAGCCCGAGCCAAGACCAG. The PCR fragments were then cut with Hind III and KpnI and inserted into the same site in the pGL3 basic vector. The pGL3 IL-4-responsive elements (IL-4RE) was generated from the pGL3-P1. It was generated with a forward primer 5′-CGATGGTACCTTTCTTCCGCAGCCGGGTAG and a reverse primer 5′-AGGAGGCCACAGAAGGTGTC. The PCR fragment was then cut with KpnI and inserted into the KpnI and SmaI site in the pTATA vector. Each individual SBE was mutated (mut) by site-directed mutagenesis using the different oligomers, mut distal SBE, mut median SBE, and mut proximal SBE and mut distal Ets binding site (dEBS), described in Table I.Table IProbes used in EMSANoneSequenceOrigindSBECCGGCCCCGCCCAGTTTCCGAGGAACTGGGCCGGGGTGGASocs1 promoter (-684/-645)GGCCGGGGCGGGTCAAAGGCTCCTTGACCCGGCCCCACCTmut dSBECCGGCCCCGCCCAGTTAGCGAGCTACTGGGCCGGGGTGGASocs1 promoter (-684/-645)GGCCGGGGCGGGTCAATCGCTCGATGACCCGGCCCCACCTmut dEBSCCGGCCCCGCCCAGTTTCATGAACTGGGCCGGGGTGGASocs1 promoter (-684/-645)GGCCGGGGCGGGTCAAAGTCTACTTGACCCGGCCCCACCTmSBECCGCGCCGCCAGGGGGTTCCTCTGAAGCCTGTGGTCAGGCCSocs1 promoter (-639/-600)GGCGCGGCGGTCCCCAAGGAGACTTCGGACACCAGTCCGGmut mSBECCGCGCCGCCAGGGGTAGCTCTCTAGCCTGTGGTCAGGCCSocs1 promoter (-639/-600)GGCGCGGCGGTCCCCATCGAGAGATCGGACACCAGTCCGGpSBETGGTCAGGCCGCCGCTTCCCGGGAAGCCCGAGCCAAGACCSocs1 promoter (-609/-570)ACCAGTCCGGCGGCGAAGGGCCCTTCGGCGTCGGTTCTGGmut pSBETGGTCAGGCCGCCGTAGCCGGCTAGCCCGAGCCAAGACCSocs1 promoter (-609/-570)ACCAGTCCGGCGGCGATCGGCCGATCGGCGTCGGTTCTGG Open table in a new tab Primer Extension—92 ng of the 20-mer primer 5′-CATGCTCCGGGGCCAGGAGC complementary to +12–+32 of the first exon was end-labeled with 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Then, 10 μg of total RNA from HaCaT cells was hybridized with 2 × 105 cpm of the labeled primer in a total volume of 11 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm each dNTP, and 0.5 mm spermidine. The hybridization was performed at 58 °C for 20 min. After hybridization, the reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 60 min upon the addition of 20 mm pyrophosphate and 1 μl of reverse transcriptase SuperScript (Invitrogen). 50% formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue was added to the total reaction mixture and run on a 8% polyacrylamide 7 m urea sequencing gel in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 1.9 mm EDTA). Detection was achieved by autoradiography on a phosphor-fluorimager (Storm 840).Immunoprecipitation, Coimmunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—After stimulation for 30 min with IL-4 (10 ng/ml), cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100 for immunoprecipitation (1% Nonidet P-40 for coimmunoprecipitation), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPP, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation. 500 μg of total protein was incubated with appropriate antibodies overnight and with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were separated through 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were probed with the appropriate antibodies. This was followed by incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences).Transfection Experiments—For transient transfection, cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes 24 h before transfection. The different plasmid DNA and the pCMVβ-galactosidase were adjusted to 3 μg of DNA and 6 μl of jet-PEI™ solution (Polyplus transfection, Illkirch, France). After 24 h incubation, cells were supplemented with fresh serum-free culture medium and stimulated with IL-4 or not stimulated. Cells were lysed 16 h later in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase gene expression was monitored using a commercial kit (Promega) and photon counting (MicroLumat Plus 96V, Berthold, Nashua, NH). Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate.For stable transfection experiments, HaCaT cells were transfected with a pIRES plasmid containing the different c-DNA coding for the different STAT6 variants and then cultured under 500 μg/ml G418 selective conditions for at least 1 month. Resistant cells were used for further experiments.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed essentially as previously described (31Giraud S. Bienvenu F. Avril S. Gascan H. Heery D.M. Coqueret O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8004-8011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). For PCR, 5 μl from a 25-μl DNA preparation were used for 35 cycles of amplification. The following primers, region –825/–439 of the Socs-1 promoter 5′-AGGCGAGATCCAGGTCCAGA (forward) and 5′-AGGAGGCCACAGAAGGTGTC (reverse), were used after anti-STAT6 or anti-Ets1/2 immunoprecipitation and region –165/+52 of the Socs-1 promoter, was used after anti-RNA pol II immunoprecipitation, primers 5′-TCCAGAAGAGAGGGAAACAG (forward) and 5′-GGCGGCTCTCGCGCATGCTC (reverse).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—HaCaT cells were stimulated with IL-4 during 30 min, scrapped in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, and pelleted. Nuclear extracts, radiolabeled double-strand oligonucleotides, were prepared, and EMSA experiments were performed as described previously (33Wery-Zennaro S. Zugaza J.L. Letourneur M. Bertoglio J. Pierre J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The probes used in EMSA are listed in Table I. Supershift experiments were performed using the anti-STAT6 or with anti-Ets specific antibodies.Oligonucleotide Pull-down Assays—Streptavidin-agarose beads were incubated overnight with 3 μg of biotin-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the distal specific probes in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 40% glycerol). Total cell extracts (1 mg of protein) were added for 90 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed in binding buffer and in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond C-extra membrane and then probed with the appropriate antibodies.RESULTSTranscriptional Regulation of SOCS-1 mRNA by IL-4 Stimulation—To analyze whether IL-4 enhances Socs-1 gene expression in keratinocytes, we first performed reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to determine its transcript level. HaCaT cells were stimulated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for increasing periods of time. As shown in Fig. 1A (top), a low level of expression of Socs-1 was observed in unstimulated cells; the expression of Socs-1 appeared after 30 min of stimulation, peaked at 2 h, and declined thereafter to the basal level in 8 h. The level of 28S mRNA expression, used as RNA loading control, was not modified by IL-4 treatment (Fig. 1A, middle). We also examined whether IL-4 could regulate the expression of two other members of the Socs family. In unstimulated cells no SOCS-3 mRNA was detected, and no modulation of its expression was detected after IL-4 stimulation (data not shown). Comparatively, a relatively high level of SOCS-2 mRNA was observed in unstimulated cells, which was not modified by cytokine treatment (Fig. 1A, bottom). To quantify SOCS-1 mRNA expression after IL-4 stimulation we used quantitative real time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1B, we observed the same time course of activation and determined a 120-fold induction of SOCS-1 mRNA expression above the basal level after 2 h of IL-4 stimulation.Cloning of the 5′-Flanking Region of Human Socs-1 Gene— We therefore undertook the cloning of the promoter region of the human Socs-1 gene. Dot plot comparison of human versus mouse sequences indicated that putative promoter elements are located on the human sequence (accession number Z46940) between 25,800 and 26,650 base position (23Schluter G. Boinska D. Nieman-Seyde S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was subjected to computational analysis (MatInspector Software) (34Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). Putative binding sites for STAT6 (3 sites), Ets (2 sites), Sp1 (4 sites), IRF-1, AP-1, and GATA-1 were found in the proximal region of the promoter. The sequence and the DNA boxes are shown in Fig. 2. Alignment of the 5′-flanking region containing the 3xSTAT6 binding sites of the human and mouse Socs-1 genes revealed a 78% sequence identity in this part of the promoter (not shown).Fig. 2Sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the human Socs-1 gene. 780 base pairs of 5′-flanking region upstream and 50 base pairs downstream from the transcriptional initiation site of 5′-untranslated region of the Socs-1 gene are depicted. The major transcription initiation site (+1) and the minor (*) are shown; potential binding sites for TATA box and transcriptional factor binding sites are underlined. The first exon of the Socs-1 gene is shaded. Arrows indicate the position of the 3′-primer (3) and 5′-primers used to generate P1-(1) and P2-PGL3 (2) reporter plasmids. PGL3-IL-4RE also used in this study was generated by using (4) as 3′-primer and (1) as 5′-primer, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The transcriptional start site was determined by computational analysis (TSSW using Softberry Software) and predicted to be located at nucleotide –16 from the first nucleotide of the previously described start of the first exon (accession number NM_003745). The real transcriptional site was determined by primer extension analysis carried out with RNA preparation from IL-4-stimulated cells using a 20-nucleotide-labeled primer. Two initiation sites were determined at nucleotide –20 and –16 from the start of the first exon (Fig. 3). This latter site seems to be the major initiation transcription site. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the Socs-1 gene contains a TATA box located –30 nucleotide from the most proximal start of transcription (Fig. 2).Fig. 3Primer extension analysis. Shown is the primer extension product obtained by reverse transcription using a specific 20-mer primer (underlined) and 30 μg of total mRNA from IL-4-stimulated HaCaT cells. The bands of 51 and 56 bp reflect the transcription initiation start sites (arrows) at positions –18 and –23 relative to the start of the first exon (shaded).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our next aim was to determine whether RNA polymerase II could occupy the transcriptional initiation site after IL-4 stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that RNA pol II was indeed recruited to the Socs-1 promoter after IL-4 stimulation of HaCaT cells (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Recruitment of RNA pol II and STAT6 to the Socs-1 promoter after IL-4 stimulation. Soluble chromatin was prepared from HaCaT cells treated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for various times and immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against RNA pol II or STAT6. The final DNA extractions were amplified using pairs of primers that cover the RNA pol II binding site (–165/+52) (A) or the three STAT6 binding sites (–825/–439) (B) region of the promoter. Input represents amplification of total DNA sample before immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sequence analysis of the putative promoter revealed the existence of three STAT6-binding element (TTCN4GAA) located in a region of 80 nucleotides, which begins at nucleotide –570 and ends at nucleotide –684 from the initiation start site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that STAT6 was recruited to this Socs-1 promoter region after IL-4 stimulation. The time course study indicated that the occupancy of the Socs-1 promoter by STAT6 was detectable as soon as 15 min after IL-4 stimulation (Fig. 4B).To identify the elements that are important for IL-4-stimulated transcription of the Socs-1 promoter, two DNA fragments were generated by PCR with two 5′-primers surrounding the three STAT6 binding sites one upstream (Fig. 2, (1)) and the other downstream (Fig. 2, (2)). The 3′-primer corresponds to the previously described start of the first exon (Fig. 2, (3)). We used genomic HaCaT DNA as the template for the Socs-1 promoter cloning. We have therefore cloned these two DNA fragments, one of ∼780 bp (PGL3-P1) and the other of ∼580 bp (PGL3-P2) into the promoterless PGL3 basic, a luciferase reporter plasmid. Transient transfection in HaCaT cells of these two promoter constructs indicated that the activity of P1 promoter was indeed enhanced by IL-4, whereas the expression of P2 was not modified by IL-4 stimulation. These results suggested that IL-4REs are located between positions –587 and –747 (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Analysis of the promoter activity of the P1 region. The [–747/+52] or [–584/+52] regions of the Socs-1 promoter were cloned in the PGL3 basic vector to give PGL3-P1 and PGL3-P2, respectively. They were cotransfected with the pCMVβ-galactosidase plasmid in HaCaT cells. Cells were stimulated 36 h after transfection for 16 h with IL-4 or left unstimulated. Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase activity. The results are expressed as the -fold increase in relative light units to the level in unstimulated cell. The data are given as means of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Implication of STAT6 in the Regulation of the Promot"
https://openalex.org/W2010090837,"The role of endogenously synthesized fibronectin (FN) in assembly was studied with cells lacking or expressing FN. Cells were cultured as homogeneous or mixed populations on surfaces coated with different matrix proteins. Compared with FN-expressing cells, FN-null cells poorly assembled exogenous plasma FN (pFN) when adhered to vitronectin or the recombinant cell-binding domain (III7–10) of FN. Vitronectin had a suppressive effect that was overcome by co-adsorbed pFN or laminin-1 but not by soluble FN. In co-cultures of FN-expressing cells and FN-null cells, endogenous FN was preferentially assembled around FN-expressing cells regardless of the adhesive ligand. If the adhesive ligand was vitronectin, exogenous pFN assembled preferentially around cells expressing cellular FN or recombinant EDa- or EDa+ FN. In co-cultures on vitronectin of FN-null cells and β1 integrin subunit-null cells, fibrils of cellular FN and pFN were preferentially deposited by FN-null (β1-expressing) cells immediately adjacent to (FN-secreting) β1-null cells. In co-cultures on vitronectin of FN-null cells and β1-null cells expressing a chimera with the extracellular domain of β1 and the cytoplasmic domain of β3, preferential assembly was by the chimera-expressing cells. These results indicate that the adhesive ligand is a determinant of FN assembly by cells not secreting endogenous FN (suppressive if vitronectin, non-suppressive but non-supportive if III7–10, supportive if pFN or laminin-1) and suggest that efficient interaction of freshly secreted cellular FN with a β1 integrin, presumably α5β1, substitutes for integrin-mediated adherence to a preformed matrix of laminin-1 or pFN to support assembly of FN. The role of endogenously synthesized fibronectin (FN) in assembly was studied with cells lacking or expressing FN. Cells were cultured as homogeneous or mixed populations on surfaces coated with different matrix proteins. Compared with FN-expressing cells, FN-null cells poorly assembled exogenous plasma FN (pFN) when adhered to vitronectin or the recombinant cell-binding domain (III7–10) of FN. Vitronectin had a suppressive effect that was overcome by co-adsorbed pFN or laminin-1 but not by soluble FN. In co-cultures of FN-expressing cells and FN-null cells, endogenous FN was preferentially assembled around FN-expressing cells regardless of the adhesive ligand. If the adhesive ligand was vitronectin, exogenous pFN assembled preferentially around cells expressing cellular FN or recombinant EDa- or EDa+ FN. In co-cultures on vitronectin of FN-null cells and β1 integrin subunit-null cells, fibrils of cellular FN and pFN were preferentially deposited by FN-null (β1-expressing) cells immediately adjacent to (FN-secreting) β1-null cells. In co-cultures on vitronectin of FN-null cells and β1-null cells expressing a chimera with the extracellular domain of β1 and the cytoplasmic domain of β3, preferential assembly was by the chimera-expressing cells. These results indicate that the adhesive ligand is a determinant of FN assembly by cells not secreting endogenous FN (suppressive if vitronectin, non-suppressive but non-supportive if III7–10, supportive if pFN or laminin-1) and suggest that efficient interaction of freshly secreted cellular FN with a β1 integrin, presumably α5β1, substitutes for integrin-mediated adherence to a preformed matrix of laminin-1 or pFN to support assembly of FN.

Nature. 2003; 423: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). FN is a disulfide-linked dimer of 230–250-kDa subunits. Each subunit is comprised mostly of 3 types of repeating modules: 12 type I modules, 2 type II modules, and 15–17 type III modules depending on splicing; and a variable region (V0, V64, V89, V95, and V120) that is not homologous to other parts of FN. There are two general types of FN: plasma FN (pFN), which is secreted by hepatocytes; and cellular FN (cFN), which is expressed and secreted by fibroblasts and other cell types. There are several structural differences between pFN and cFN. Two type III modules (EDa and EDb) are missing completely in pFN, but variably present in cFN. The V region is also completely missing in one of its subunits in pFN, but present in both subunits of cFN (1Hynes R.O. Rich A. Fibronectins, Springer Series in Molecular Biology.

Cell adhesion to immobilized FN by α5β1 integrin is mediated by the RGD sequence in the 10th type III module (III10) (4Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E.

Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 70-kDa region of FN binds to these sites with high affinity in a reversible and saturable manner (8McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J.

Cross-linking studies with the N-terminal 70-kDa fragment revealed molecules that migrated with apparent sizes of >3000 kDa in SDS gels, suggesting that the receptors for the N-terminal region are either of unprecedented size or resistant to solubilization with SDS (15Zhang Q.H.

Because integrins are key mediators of cell adhesion to immobilized ligands such as FN, however, sorting out the roles of integrins in assembly of FN is complicated.Both pFN and cFN have the potential to be deposited into the extracellular matrix (23Peters D.M.P. Portz L.M. Fullenwider J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 163-179Google Scholar). Knockout of FN in the mouse results in embryonic lethality (25George E.L. Georgeslabouesse E.N. Patelking R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that deposition of FN is necessary for early development. Normal skin wound healing and hemostasis, however, were observed in adult mice with a conditional knockout of pFN (26Sakai T. Johnson K.J. Murozono M. Sakai K. Magnuson M.A. Wieloch T. Cronberg T. Isshiki A. Erickson H.P. Fassler R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), suggesting that pFN has a minor role, and cFN is sufficient for physiologically important assembly of FN. A recent study of effects of siRNAs to inhibit FN synthesis in organ culture indicated that expression of cFN by cleft epithelium directs branching morphogenesis of mouse salivary glands by a process that is inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against the α5, α6, or β1 integrin subunit (2Sakai T. Larsen M. Yamada K.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). When 0.125–8 mg/ml (0.25–16 μm) exogenous pFN was added to organ culture, branching of salivary glands was stimulated (2Sakai T. Larsen M. Yamada K.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These results indicated that small amounts of cFN have effects that can be replicated only by larger amounts of pFN.Here, we compare assembly of FN by monolayers of cFN-expressing and FN-null cells studied as homogeneous or mixed cultures on surfaces coated with different matrix proteins. The nature of the surface coating influenced assembly of exogenous FN much more for FN-null cells than for cFN-expressing cells. FN-null cells poorly assembled exogenous FN when adherent to vitronectin (VN) or the recombinant cell-binding domain (III7–10) of FN. VN had a suppressive effect that was overcome by surface-adsorbed pFN or laminin-1 (LN), but not by exogenously added soluble pFN or recombinant EDa+ or EDa-FN, whereas III7–10 was simply unable to support FN assembly by FN-null cells. cFN was preferentially assembled by cFN-expressing cells regardless of the adhesive ligand. If the adhesive ligand was VN, pFN was assembled preferentially by cFN-expressing cells or transfected FN-null cells expressing recombinant EDa+ or EDa-FN. In co-cultures on VN of FN-null cells and β1-null cells or β1-null cells expressing wild-type β1A or a chimeric β integrin subunit with the extracellular domain of β1 and cytoplasmic domain of β3, the deposition pattern of cFN and pFN was dependent upon re-expression of a β integrin subunit with the extracellular domain of β1 in the cFN-expressing β1-null cells. We conclude that secreted FN assembles preferentially around cFN-expressing cells and such locally assembled cFN functions like surface-adsorbed pFN or LN to support assembly of soluble FN. This supporting effect is at least partially because of interaction of secreted FN with integrins containing the extracellular domain of β1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—The derivation of FN-/-mouse fibroblastic cells (FN-null cells) and FN+/-cells (cFN-expressing cells) from FN-/- or FN+/-mouse embryonic stem cells was described previously (27Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). β1-null GD25 cells and GD10 cells deficient in the integrin β1 subunit had been derived by a similar technique and transfected with the β1A splice variant to give β1-expressing β1A GD25 cells (19Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fassler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) or β1A GD10 cells. β1Aβ3 GD10 cells were generated by transfection of GD10 cells by a β1A/β3 chimeric construct in which the cytoplasmic domain of β1A was replaced with the cytoplasmic domain of β3 (28Danen E.H.J. Sonneveld P. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1071-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). GFP-expressing FN-null cells were generated by transfection of GFP followed by selection of a stable population with puromycin. A plasmid encoding GFP (pEGFP-N1, Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was digested with NheI and NotI, and the isolated NheI/NotI DNA fragment encoding GFP was then ligated to pIRESpuro2 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) double-di-gested with NheI and NotI. FN-null cells were transfected with the selectable GFP expression plasmid by the liposome method (LipofectAmine™, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).Expression of GFP-fused FNs—pFH101 and pFH100 (29Dufour S. Gutman A. Bois F. Lamb N. Thiery J.P. Kornblihtt A.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which encode EDa+, EDb-, V89 human FN, and EDa-, EDb-, V89 human FN, respectively, were gift from Dr. Alberto R. Kornblihtt (Buenos Aires, Argentina). The constructs were manipulated so that protein processing is mediated by the native preprosequence of human FN. A HindIII site, which had been made in the leader sequence region during cloning of pFH101, was erased by substituting a DNA fragment generated by RT (reverse transcription)-PCR of total RNA from AH1F human foreskin dermal fibroblasts. The coding sequence of pFH101 was ligated to the NheI and NotI sites in pIRESpuro2 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). GFP was introduced between the third and fourth type III modules as pioneered by Ohashi et al. (30Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create a KpnI restriction enzyme site between the third and fourth type III modules into which the cDNA of GFP was inserted after amplification with primers that added KpnI sites at both ends. The sequence at the insertion site in FN is (III3)TTGTMIEQ(gfp)DEFFGT-PRSD(III4). The GFP coding sequence is underlined. The cloning strategy resulted in the insertion of two amino acids (GT) at one end of the GFP. An EcoRI fragment (2530 bp) after EcoRI digestion of the cDNA encoding GFP-FN(EDa+) was replaced with the EcoRI fragment (2260 bps) of pFH100 to construct GFP-FN(EDa-). Plasmids encoding GFP-FN(EDa+) or GFP-FN(EDa-) were transfected into FN-null cells in monolayer culture by the liposome method. About 30 h after transfection, cells were suspended by trypsinization and plated on coverslips. Because of a low transfection efficiency of about ∼1%, most of the cells remained FN-null.Preparations of Insect Cell Medium Containing Human EDa+ or EDa-FN and of AH1F Cell Medium—Recombinant baculovirus was generated by cotransfection of Baculogold-linearized AcNPV viral DNA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and cDNA encoding mature human EDa+ FN or EDa-FN, which had been cloned in pCOCO transfer vector (31Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Adams J. Methods in Cell-Matrix Adhesion. 69. Academic Press, Burlington, MA2002: 69-81Google Scholar). Viruses were cloned and amplified as described (31Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Adams J. Methods in Cell-Matrix Adhesion. 69. Academic Press, Burlington, MA2002: 69-81Google Scholar). Human EDa+ FN and EDa-FN were expressed by infecting High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) in SF900II serum-free medium at 27 °C with pass 4 virus. Conditioned medium was collected ∼65-h postinfection, and concentrated to one-eighth of the initial volume using the Amicon® Ultra-Centrifugal filter device (MWCO = 10,000, Millipore, Bedford, MA) after cells were spun down and removed. The concentrated medium was dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, and then dialyzed again against DMEM containing 0.2% BSA. For preparation of medium conditioned with cFN of AH1F human dermal fibroblasts, AH1F cells were incubated on VN-coated surface for 24 h in serum-free medium (DMEM + 0.2% BSA), and the medium was centrifuged to save supernatant. FN present in AH1F cell medium and concentrated insect cell medium was quantified by Western blots.Fluorescent Labeling of pFN (Rx-pFN)—Human pFN, purified on DEAE-cellulose as described before (32Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was labeled with Rhodamine Red™-X (FluoReporter Rhodamine Red™-X Protein Labeling kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following slight modifications. Rhodamine Red™-X dissolved in Me2SO was diluted in 0.5 m carbonate buffer (Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, pH 9.5) to 0.5 mg/ml, and pFN was diluted in 0.05 m carbonate buffer (Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, pH 9.5) to 2 mg/ml for the conjugation reaction.Cell Culture—Cells were suspended with 0.05% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA solution for ∼5 min at 37 °C. Trypsin was quenched by washing with 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM (Cellgro Mediatech, VA), followed by washing with PBS, and cells were cultured at 60∼70% confluence for 4 or 18 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA (Sigma) on glass coverslips coated with pFN (3 μg/ml), LN extracted from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor (10 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), VN (3 μg/ml) (33Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or III7–10 (3 μg/ml) (34Leahy D.J. Erickson H.P. Aukhil I. Joshi P. Hendrickson W.A.

The adhesive proteins were diluted to the indicated concentrations in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with the coverslips overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C and washing with PBS, coverslips were used within 24 h for cell culture. For some experiments, 2 μm lysophosphatidic acid (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), or 15 μg/ml cyclo[Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val] (cRGDfV, BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) was added to culture medium.Fluorescence Microscopy—Deposited FN was visualized with rabbit polyclonal antibodies and Rhodamine Red™-X-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies, although produced against human pFN, cross-reacted with mouse FN as demonstrated by Western blotting and ELISA. To visualize exogenous pFN only, Rx-pFN was added to the culture medium at 9 μg/ml. To detect EDa+ FN in the presence of pFN, the IST-9 monoclonal antibody to the EDa type III module of human FN (36Carnemolla B. Borsi L. Zardi L. Owens R.J. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Harlan Sera-lab Limited, UK) and Alexa Fluor R 350 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) were used. Before staining cells with antibodies, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. For staining of intracellular proteins after paraformaldehyde fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. For staining of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol for 5 min. Monoclonal antibody against vinculin (hVIN-1) was from Sigma, monoclonal antibody against β1 integrin (MB1.2) was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and monoclonal antibodies against paxillin (clone 349), FAK (clone 77), and β3 integrin (2C9.G2) were from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Secondary antibodies, Rhodamine Red™-X-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG, Rhodamine Red™-X-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rat IgG, and Rhodamine Red™-X-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. After blocking with 1% BSA overnight at 4 °C or for 10 min at 25 °C, cells were stained with ∼10 μg/ml of primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing with PBS. After staining cells with ∼10 μg/ml of secondary antibodies for 40 min at room temperature and washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted on Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were viewed on an Olympus epifluorescence microscope (BX60, Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY). Pictures were taken with an RT Slider digital camera (Spot Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) and processed with Spot RT Software v3 and Adobe Photoshop version 5.0 (Adobe System Inc., San Jose, CA) for Mac OS.Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested and suspended in PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 1.0 × 106/ml of cells were incubated with ∼0.5 μg/ml of primary antibody, and then incubated at 4 °C with ∼10 μg/ml of allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (BD Pharmingen) or biotin-conjugated mouse anti-Armenian and Syrian hamster IgG monoclonal antibody and streptavidin-APC conjugate (BD Pharmingen). Mouse β1 was detected with MB1.2. Monoclonal antibody MFR5 to mouse α5, H9.2B8 to mouse αV, 2C9.G2 to mouse β3, and GoH3 to mouse α6 were all from BD Pharmingen). For control samples, cells were incubated only with secondary antibody. Cells (at least 8,000 per sample) were analyzed in a Facs-Caliber (BD Biosciences).Assays of LN and FN—Cells (2 × 105) were cultured at 37 °C in 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA in 6-well cell culture cluster plates (surface area per well: 10 cm2, Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) coated with VN (3 μg/ml). After 4 or 18 h, cells were lysed with 300 μl of extraction buffer (1.5% Triton X-100, 0.05 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to the harvested culture medium. The cell extracts and culture medium were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved for Western blotting. For detection of FN and LN in Western blots, our anti-FN rabbit antibodies or anti-LN rabbit antibodies (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, Co) and peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG were used.Cell Adhesion Assays—FN, VN, LN, or BSA were coated at 2–10 μg/ml onto wells of a 96-well plate, and the wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a suspension of DMEM containing 0.2% BSA with or without 40 μg/ml of GoH3 anti-mouse α6 monoclonal antibody or 15–30 μg/ml cRGDfV. The cells were then allowed to attach to wells for 2 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing, and adherent cells were quantified by colorimetric detection at 595 nm using a microplate reader (Model EL340, BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc.), and data were obtained with DELTA Soft II™ (BioMetallics, Inc.).RESULTSFN-null Cells Assemble Exogenously Added pFN When Adherent to pFN or LN but Not When Adherent to VN or a Recombinant FN Protein That Comprises 7th Type III through 10th Type III Repeat—FN-null cells allow experimental analysis of the contributions of the three sources of FN in cell culture (soluble exogenous FN, exogenous FN adherent to the substrate, and endogenous FN) on assembly of FN. We first studied the effects of adhesive proteins coated on the substrate on assembly of exogenously added FN. During a 4-h culture in serum-free medium (DMEM + 0.2% BSA) containing 9 μg/ml (20 nm) Rhodamine Red™-X-conjugated pFN (Rx-pFN), FN-null cells and cFN-expressing cells both assembled exogenously added Rx-pFN when adherent to pFN- or LN-coated coverslips (Fig. 1A). When adherent to VN, however, cFN-expressing cells assembled pFN better than FN-null cells did (Fig. 1A). Comparing substrates, cFN-expressing cells assembled pFN better when adherent to pFN or LN than when adherent to VN, but the difference was not as great as between FN-null cells cultured on the same substrates. These results indicate that substrate-coated VN is poorly supportive for assembly of exogenous pFN by FN-null cells whereas substrate-coated pFN or LN is supportive and that expression of endogenous cFN facilitates assembly of exogenous pFN.The Effect of VN on Assembly of Exogenous pFN by FN-null Cells Is Suppressive and Overcome by Surface-adsorbed pFN or LN—A number of experiments were performed to characterize further the different effects of adhesive proteins on the assembly of pFN by FN-null cells versus cFN-expressing cells. Because α5β1 integrin is known to be strongly supportive for assembly of FN (16Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J.

FN-null cells and cFN-expressing cells expressed similar levels of α5 and β1 integrin subunits as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). Mean fluorescence intensities varied <1.7-fold. FN-null cells and cFN-expressing cells were also found to express equal amounts of α6 subunit, adhere equally well to LN and respond to the GoH3 anti-mouse α6 monoclonal antibody by inhibited adhesion to LN (results not shown). Finally, FN-null cells and cFN-expressing cells were found to express similar levels of αV and β3 integrin subunits as tested by flow cytometry (results not shown). αVβ3 was the major receptor for adhesion of both FN-null cells and cFN-expressing cells on a VN-coated surface as assessed by inhibited adhesion upon incubation with cRGDfV, which interacts specifically with αVβ3 integrin (38Brooks P.C.

Similar co-coating experiments with FN-null cells indicated that VN is also suppressive for FN-null cells. Thus, a co-coat with 6–9 μg/ml pFN overcame the negative effects of a coat of 2 μg/ml VN on FN-null cells (Fig. 2A) as effectively as it did with control β1-null cells (results not shown). Coating with an increasing amount of LN also overcame the suppressive effects of VN, and an increasing amount of VN overcame the facilitating effect of LN (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, whereas a coat of 5 μg/ml LN poorly supported adhesion and assembly of pFN by FN-null cells, addition of an intermediate coat of 3 μg/ml VN enhanced the facilitating effect of LN (Fig. 2A).

Extension of lifespan after c-myc transduction into p21-null cells was followed at later passages by apoptosis of a large fraction of c-myc-overexpressing p21-null cells. This apoptotic effect could be overridden by inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor or oncogenic ras expression. Ras-induced inhibition of apoptosis is mediated by PI3K activation. These results suggest a functional relationship between ras and myc that may explain their oncogenic cooperation. The number of foci formed by myc+ras increased cooperatively in the absence of p21waf1. Thus, the reciprocal cooperation between myc and ras in a p21-null background during cellular immortalization lead to increased oncogenic cooperation between ras and myc."

Although the ϵ subunit appears to be tightly associated with the γ subunit in the central stalk region of the rotor assembly, several studies suggest that the C-terminal domain of ϵ can undergo significant conformational change as part of a regulatory process. Here we use disulfide cross-linking of substituted cysteines on functionally coupled ATP synthase to characterize interactions of ϵ with an F0 component of the rotor (subunit c) and with an F1 component of the stator (subunit β). Oxidation of the engineered F0F1 causes formation of two disulfide bonds, βD380C-S108C ϵ and ϵE31C-cQ42C, to give a β-ϵ-c cross-linked product in high yield. The results demonstrate the ability of ϵ to span the central stalk region from the surface of the membrane (ϵ-c) to the bottom of F1 (β-ϵ) and suggest that the conformation detected here is distinct from both the “closed” state seen with isolated ϵ (Uhlin, U., Cox, G. B., and Guss, J. M. (1997) Structure 5, 1219–1230) and the “open” state seen in a complex with a truncated form of the γ subunit (Rodgers, A. J., and Wilce, M. C. (2000) Nat. Struct.

The rate of cross-linking at the ϵ/c (rotor/rotor) interface is not influenced by the type of nucleotide added. In contrast, the rate of β-ϵ cross-linking is fastest under ATP hydrolysis conditions, intermediate with MgADP, and slowest with MgAMP-PNP. This is consistent with a regulatory role for a reversible β/ϵ (stator/rotor) interaction that blocks rotation and inhibits catalysis. Furthermore, the rate of β-ϵ cross-linking is much faster than that indicated by previous studies, allowing for the possibility of a rapid response to regulatory signals.

It is now widely accepted that a central rotor (γϵc10), driven by a current of protons through F0, rotates relative to a stator (α3β3δab2) to induce cyclical conformational changes between tight substrate binding and product release at alternating, cooperative catalytic sites on F1 (Fig. 1A).

In each case, an N-terminal β-sandwich domain is connected by a loop to a smaller C-terminal domain that consists of a pair of antiparallel α-helices, with the second helix packed against one edge of the β-sandwich to give a compact “closed” structure (Fig. 1B, green). Genetic truncations have shown that only the N-terminal domain of ϵ is essential for coupled function (26Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). In the bovine MF1 structure (25Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), the closed conformation of the homolog of ϵ appears to be fixed by interactions with a small accessory subunit that is unique to the mitochondrial synthase. The closed conformation of ϵ can also be fixed in EcF0F1 by disulfide cross-linking of substituted cysteines without loss of ATP synthesis activity (34Schulenberg B. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

However, for some bacterial and chloroplast synthases, the C-terminal domain of ϵ appears to modulate the ATPase activity in a manner that suggests a possible regulatory role (34Schulenberg B.

Consistent with such a role, the C-terminal domain of ϵ has been observed to undergo significant conformational change in response to different nucleotides and/or the presence of an electrochemical gradient (for reviews, see Refs. 4Duncan T.M. Hackney D.D. Tamanoi F. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes: Energy Coupling and Molecular Motors. 23. Elsevier Academic Press, New York2004: 203-275Google Scholar, 37Richter M.L. Hein R. Huchzermeyer B. Biochim.

Cross-linking studies with EcF0F1 have shown that ϵSer-108, located in the hairpin loop between the C-terminal helices, can achieve close contact with βAsp-380 and βGlu-381 in the DELSEED motif of a β subunit (13Bulygin V.V.

Structure. 2002; 10: 921-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) suggest that the β-DELSEED motif functions as a tracking guide for rotation of γ between β subunits. Thus an interaction between this motif and the C-terminal domain of ϵ could interfere with subunit rotation, thereby inhibiting catalysis. The closed conformation of ϵ shown in Fig. 1B does not predict such an interaction, because the β-carbons of ϵSer-108 and the nearest βDELSEED sequence are about 50 Å apart. However, a partially unfolded “open” conformation of the C-terminal domain of ϵ was observed in a crystal structure of a complex of ϵ with the central-stalk domain of γ (45Rodgers A.J. Wilce M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this complex the C-terminal helices of ϵ are separated from each other as well as from the β-sandwich and wrap around a portion of γ that, if docked into the MF1 structure (Fig. 1C), would interact with the bottom of the α3β3 hexamer. A disulfide cross-link (γL99C-ϵS118C) was used to confirm that the C-terminal domain of ϵ can adopt this open conformation in EcF0F1 (35Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, this structure is also unable to account for β-ϵ cross-links involving ϵS108C, because the β-carbons of ϵSer-108 and the nearest βAsp-380 are still far too distant (∼25 Å; Fig. 1C) to allow formation of a disulfide bond (∼5 Å (46Sowdhamini R. Srinivasan N. Shoichet B. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)). Because the available high resolution structures are unable to explain the β-ϵ cross-linking results, it has been suggested that ϵ might release from the c-ring to move closer to the β subunit (25Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Results presented here show that this need not occur. Cross-linking experiments using well coupled EcF0F1 provide evidence for a conformation of ϵ in which ϵSer-108 contacts the DELSEED region of a β subunit while, at the same time, ϵGlu-31 of the N-terminal domain remains in contact with the polar loop of a c-subunit in F0. These results establish the ability of ϵ to span the entire central stalk from the surface of the membrane to the bottom of F1. The presence of MgATP, MgADP, or MgAMP-PNP has different effects on the rate of β-ϵ cross-linking, consistent with a possible regulatory role for this stator/rotor interaction. Furthermore, the rapid rate of formation of the β-ϵ cross-link indicates a more dynamic flexibility of the C-terminal domain of ϵ than suggested by previous studies.

Reconstitution of F1 with F1-depleted Membranes—βD380C/ϵS108C/ϵE31C-F1 was incubated at 1 mg/ml with 2 mg/ml F1-depleted membranes containing cQ42C-F0 in TME buffer for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 2 mm DTT (11Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Excess F1 was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 45 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended, washed twice with TME buffer containing 2 mm DTT, and finally resuspended in the same buffer at 4–6 mg of protein/ml. Immediately prior to each experiment, membrane samples were diluted to ∼2.5 mg/ml with TME buffer and passed through centrifuge columns of Sephadex-G-50–80 (49Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) equilibrated with the same buffer to remove DTT. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on 4–15% gradient gels (Ready Gels, Bio-Rad), using 3–23 μg of protein/lane. Because non-reducing conditions were used in gel assays for intersubunit disulfide cross-linking, it was necessary to block free cysteine residues. For this purpose, samples were treated for an additional 30 min at 22 °C with 5 mm NEM and then denatured with SDS at 37 °C, again in the presence of 5 mm NEM, before applying to gels. Protein bands were stained with SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and analyzed using an imager (STORM 860, Amersham Biosciences) in the blue-fluorescence mode as described previously (18Hutcheon M.L. Duncan T.M. Ngai H. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8519-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For the immunoblots shown in Fig. 3, proteins were transferred from an unstained gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen) in a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot cell for 1 h at 250 mA in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. The blotted membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat, dried milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), incubated for 2 h in TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin with anti-ϵ (1:5000), anti-c (1:5000) or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:6000), and rinsed three times with TBST containing an additional 0.1 m NaCl. The immunoblot was then incubated for 1.5 h with 2 μCi of the appropriate 125I-labeled secondary antibody, rinsed four times with TBST containing 0.1 m NaCl, air dried, and exposed to a standard phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) for 12–14 h. The exposed screen was then scanned with the imager in phosphorimaging mode. Analysis of 125I-labeled protein bands was done using ImageQuaNT 5.1 software (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblots shown in Fig. 4 were treated with anti-ϵ primary antibody, washed as described above, and then incubated for 1.5 h in TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (1:1600), rinsed four times with TBST containing 0.1 m NaCl, and air-dried for 20 min. Quantitation of ϵ in protein bands was performed with the imager in the blue-fluorescence mode.Fig. 4Nucleotide-specific effects on the time course of β-ϵ cross-linking. Aliquots of the βD380C/ϵS108C/cQ42C-F0F1-reconstituted membranes were incubated at 0.45 mg/ml in TME buffer containing 5 μm FCCP for 1 min in the presence of 2 mm ADP, ATP, or AMP-PNP and then oxidized with 50 μm DTNB for the times indicated. NEM (5 mm final) was then added, and each sample was incubated for an additional 30 min. As a control, membranes were resuspended in TME buffer containing 5 μm FCCP, and 5 mm NEM was added immediately before addition of DTNB. Aliquots containing 3 μg of membrane protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting under non-reducing conditions, and bands containing ϵ were detected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoblots shown in A illustrate the effects of ATP and AMP-PNP on the rate of formation of the β-ϵ cross-link. B shows the time course for β-ϵ disulfide formation in the presence of ATP (•), ADP (○), or AMP-PNP (▾). The relative yield of β-ϵ is normalized to the yield obtained in a sample oxidized for 60 s in the presence of MgATP. Data points are averages of four determinations, and error bars represent the standard error. Control immunoblotting experiments, using varied amounts of oxidized membranes, established that the assay provided a linear response to ϵ in the β-ϵ band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Other Assays—The ATPase activity of membrane vesicles (2–3 μg of protein/ml) was measured at 30 °C with a coupled enzyme assay (51Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Datta A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, and 3mm MgCl2. To prevent formation of a transmembrane proton gradient and to block NADH oxidation by the respiratory chain, 5 μm FCCP and 5 mm KCN were also present in the assay. NADH- and ATP-driven uptake of protons by membrane vesicles was assayed by the quenching of fluorescence of 2.5 μm acridine orange using 100 μg of membrane protein/ml as described previously (52Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry assay (53Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound F0F1-ATP Synthase with Cysteine Substitutions in the β, ϵ, and c Subunits Retains Coupled Functions— Previous studies with soluble and membrane-bound F1 showed that βD380C (13Bulygin V.V. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31765-31769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or βE381C (43Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), in the DELSEED motif of β, could form a disulfide cross-link with ϵS108C in the C-terminal domain of ϵ. Other studies established that ϵE31C, in the N-terminal domain of ϵ, could be cross-linked to cQ42C in the polar loop of a c subunit in F0 (31Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test for the simultaneous interaction of ϵ with β and c subunits, we combined the βD380C, ϵS108C, and ϵE31C mutations in a single construct. To avoid complications due to cross-link formation between βD380C and the naturally occurring γCys-87, the γC87S mutation was also included (54Duncan T.M. Zhou Y. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but not specified in the enzyme nomenclature due to its silent role. Soluble βD380C/ϵS108C/ϵE31C-F1 was purified and reconstituted with F1-depleted membrane vesicles containing cQ42C-F0. To determine the combined effects of these mutations, we measured the ATPase and proton-pumping activities of the reconstituted membranes. As shown in Table I, the membranes exhibited wild-type activities under reducing conditions (line 1). Furthermore, pretreating membranes with DCCD inhibited both ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven proton transport (line 2), as observed with native wild-type membranes.Table IATP hydrolysis and proton transport by reconstituted membranesConditionsATPaseFluorescence quenchingNADH-drivenATP-drivenUnits/mg (%)%1) +DTT3.60 (100)75772) +DTT+DCCD0.61 (17)9303) +DTNB0.54 (15)790 Open table in a new tab Oxidation of the Mutant ATP Synthase Yields a Disulfide-linked β-ϵ-c Product—To test for disulfide cross-linking of subunits in βD380C/ϵS108C/ϵE31C/cQ42C-F0F1, membranes were treated with DTNB. As shown by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), a cross-linked product of about 74 kDa is seen in the oxidized sample (lane 1) that is not present in the non-oxidized control (lane 2). The amount of protein remaining in the β band of the oxidized sample (lane 1) is 34% less than that of the control (lane 2), indicating a high yield of cross-linking between ϵ and one of the three β subunits. As expected, the 74-kDa band was not observed with F1-stripped E. coli membranes (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). In experiments not shown, we also obtained the 74-kDa cross-linked product using 20 μm CuCl2 as oxidant in TME buffer lacking EDTA. However, CuCl2 treatment required a longer incubation time, gave a lower yield of the 74-kDa product, and gave increased levels of undesired cross-links (e.g. β-β). The size of the major cross-linked band is consistent with a predicted molecular mass of 73 kDa for a 1:1:1 β-ϵ-c complex that would result upon formation of both the βD380C-ϵS108C and ϵE31C-cQ42C cross-links. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of subunits ϵ (Fig. 3A) and c (panel B) in the 74-kDa band. To test for the presence of the β subunit, βD380C containing the “FLAG” epitope at the N terminus (11Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. H"
https://openalex.org/W2087110703,"We have previously shown that non-pathogenic Gram-negative Bacteroides vulgatus induces transient RelA phosphorylation (Ser-536), NF-κB activity, and pro-inflammatory gene expression in native and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. We now demonstrate that 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) but not prostaglandin E2 inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (B. vulgatus)/LPS (Escherichia coli)-induced RelA phosphorylation and interleukin-6 gene expression in the colonic epithelial cell line CMT-93. This inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 was mediated independently of LPS-induced IκBα phosphorylation/degradation and RelA nuclear translocation as well as RelA DNA binding activity. Interestingly, although B. vulgatus induced nuclear expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in native epithelium of monoassociated Fisher rats, PPARγ-specific knock-down in CMT-93 cells using small interference RNA failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of PPARγ agonist 15d-PGJ2, suggesting PPARγ-independent mechanisms. In addition, 15d-PGJ2 but not the synthetic high affinity PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone triggered ERK1/2 phosphorylation in IEC, and most importantly, MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 reversed the inhibitory effect of 15dPGJ2 on LPS-induced RelA phosphorylation and interleukin-6 gene expression. Calyculin A, a specific phosphoserine/phospho-threonine phosphatase inhibitor increased the basal phosphorylation of RelA and reversed the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 on LPS-induced RelA phosphorylation. We further demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments that 15d-PGJ2 triggered protein phosphatase 2A activity, which directly dephosphorylated RelA in LPS-stimulated CMT-93 cells. We concluded that 15d-PGJ2 may help to control NF-κB signaling and normal intestinal homeostasis to the enteric microflora by modulating RelA phosphorylation in IEC through altered protein phosphatase 2A activity.

The mucosal surfaces and cavities of the gastrointestinal tract in humans and animals are populated by a complex mixture of non-pathogenic microorganisms of more than 400 species having spatial differences in population size and relative species predominance along the digestive tract (1Berg R.D.

The host has evolved various homeostatic mechanisms to acquire tolerance (hyporesponsiveness) to resident enteric microorganisms, whereas protective cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to enteropathogens are maintained. This complex homeostasis toward the normal enteric microflora is broken under conditions of chronic intestinal inflammation including the chronically relapsing, immune-mediated idiopathic disorders ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (5Bouma G. Strober W. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 6Podolsky D.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). The selective effect of microbial factors in initiating and perpetuating chronic intestinal inflammation is extensively supported in comparative studies using germ-free and gnotobiotic rodent models for experimental colitis (7Strober W. Fuss I.J. Blumberg R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 495-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). For example, reconstitution studies with various non-pathogenic bacteria implicate Bacteroides vulgatus as particularly important to the induction of experimental colitis in monoassociated HLA-B27 transgenic rats (8Rath H.C.

Panes J. Miranda M. Salas A. Elizalde J.I. Sans M. Arce Y. Bordas J.M. Fernandez-Checa J.C. Pique J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Wahl C.

Indeed, local administration of antisense RelA oligonucleotides abrogated clinical and histological signs of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced experimental colitis, suggesting a mechanistic role for sustained NF-κB activity in the pathogenesis of chronic mucosal inflammation (15Neurath M. Pettersson S. Meyer Zum Buschenfelde K.-H. Strober W. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). On the other hand, blocking NF-κB activity with pharmacological inhibitors during the resolution phase of carrageenan-induced acute inflammation is deleterious to the host (16Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), suggesting dual functions of activated NF-κB including protective and detrimental mechanisms during the course of inflammation. The induction of the IκB/NF-κB system and NF-κB-dependent gene expression is a complex process that involves the participation of multiple adaptor proteins and kinases acting in a coordinate fashion to give specificity to the cell surface stimuli. We have previously shown that B. vulgatus and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal through the TLR4 cascade to trigger IRAK1 degradation and IκBα phosphorylation/degradation as well as NF-κB DNA binding activity and NF-κB transcriptional activity in native and IEC lines (17Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to the activation of the IκB/NF-κB system and nuclear translocation of transcriptionally active RelA, the modification of NF-κB transcriptional activity by phosphorylation of RelA at various serine residues (Ser-276, Ser-529, Ser-536) has been shown to be an important regulatory element of this signaling pathway (18Sizemore N.

Potential kinases involved in signal-induced RelA phosphorylation are the casein kinase II, Akt, and IKK. We showed that IKKβ and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway participate in B. vulgatus-induced phosphorylation of serine 529 and/or 536 of the RelA transactivating domain 1 (TAD1) in IEC (17Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Most importantly for the physiological relevance, we showed that monoassociation of wild type rats with B. vulgatus triggered transient nuclear localization of phosphorylated (Ser-536) and transcriptionally active NF-κB subunit RelA (p65) in the intestinal epithelium (17Haller D.

The absence of colitis and pathological immune responses in B. vulgatus-monoassociated wild type rats confirmed the non-pathogenic nature of this obligate anaerobic Gram-negative bacterial strain and suggests that the normal host developed mechanisms to control NF-κB activity in IEC (23Haller D.

Protein serine/threonine phosphatases including PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C are involved in the regulation of signaling pathways with a variety of protein kinases (24Zolnierowicz S. Biochem.

The predominant heterotrimeric form of PP2A consists of the 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and a 65-kDa regulatory subunit (PP2Aa or PR65). In addition, several regulatory subunits are associated with the core enzyme, conferring substrate specificity to its dephosphorylating activity (24Zolnierowicz S. Biochem.

It appears from several studies that TZD and 15d-PGJ2, which is present in vivo during the resolution phase of acute inflammation (43Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J.

In this study we characterized the molecular mechanism for the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 on RelA phosphorylation (Ser-536) and IL-6 gene expression in IEC. Consistent with the transient induction of phospho-RelA (Ser-536) in the intestinal epithelium of B. vulgatus-monoassociated Fisher rats, 15d-PGJ2 but not the synthetic high affinity PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone inhibited LPS (B. vulgatus)/LPS (Escherichia coli)-induced RelA phosphorylation and IL-6 gene expression in CMT-93 cells. Although B. vulgatus triggered nuclear expression of PPARγ in native epithelium of monoassociated Fisher rats, PPARγ-specific knock-down in CMT-93 cells using small interference RNA failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of PPARγ agonist 15d-PGJ2, suggesting PPARγ-independent mechanisms. Finally, we could demonstrate that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits LPS-induced RelA phosphorylation and IL-6 gene expression in IEC through the induction of the ERK signaling cascade by modulating PP2A activity. Animals and Bacterial Monoassociation—Germ-free Fisher F344 rats were monoassociated at 10–12 weeks of age with B. vulgatus (a generous gift from Dr. A. B. Onderdonk, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) and maintained in the Gnotobiotic Animal Core at the College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University (Raleigh, NC). Bacterial monoassociation and the absence of contamination by other bacterial species were confirmed by culturing samples from the large intestine at necropsy and culturing serial fecal samples. Animal use protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), North Carolina State University. Rats were killed 3, 7, 14, and 35 days after initial bacterial colonization. Germ-free mice were used as controls. Sections of the ileum, cecum, proximal, and distal colon were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin. Histology scoring was analyzed by blindly assessing the degree of lamina propria mononuclear cell infiltration, crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, and architectural distortion. Immunohistochemistry and Isolation of Primary Rat Intestinal Epithelial Cells—B. vulgatus-monoassociated and germ-free rats were euthanized, and the cecum as well as colon were removed and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum. Cecum and colon were cut longitudinally, washed three times in calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), cut into pieces 0.5 cm long, and incubated at 37 °C in 40 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min in an orbital shaker. The supernatant was filtered and centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g, and the cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. The remaining tissue was incubated in 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (1×) containing 1.5 mm EDTA for an additional 10 min. The supernatant was filtered and centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g, and the cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Finally, primary IEC were collected by centrifugation through a 25/40% discontinuous Percoll gradient at 600 × g for 30 min. Cell viability and purity was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using mouse anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, clone G4.18). Cells were >80% viable and >90% pure. Primary rat IEC from cecum and colon were combined and collected in sample buffer for subsequent Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed using anti-PPARγ Ab (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Cell Culture and Bacterial Infection—The IEC line CMT-93 (passage 10–30) (ATCC CRL 223, American Type Culture Collection) was grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C to confluency in 6-well tissue culture plates (Cell Star, Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany) as previously described (17Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). B. vulgatus was anaerobically grown at 37 °C in brain-heart infusion broth. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 15 min) supplemented with cysteine (0.05%), hemin (5 mg/liter), and resazurin at stationary growth phase. For LPS purification, B. vulgatus was killed by the addition of 1% phenol (Fluka, Heidelberg) and washed thoroughly with twice-distilled water. Endotoxin was extracted and purified by the method of Westphal et al. (26Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Purity was checked by SDS-PAGE (46Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). Confluent epithelial cell monolayers were stimulated with B. vulgatus LPS (10 μg/ml) and E. coli LPS (10 μg/ml; from E. coli serotype O111:B4, Sigma) in the presence or absence of 20 μm 15d-PGJ2 (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and 20 μm rosiglitazone (BioMol). Where indicated, cells were treated with 20 μm MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem) or 1–5 nm calyculin A (Cell Signaling). RNA Isolation and Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA from IEC was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was dissolved in 20 μl of water containing 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate. For reverse transcription, 1 μg of total RNA was added to 30 μl of reaction buffer containing 8 μl of 5× first-strand buffer, 4 μl of dithiothreitol (100 mm), and 6 μl of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate mixture (300 μm) (all reagents from Invitrogen) and incubated for 5 min at 65 °C. After adding 10 μl of a solution containing 0.2 μg of random hexamers, 40 units of RNase Out, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (all reagents from Invitrogen), the total mixture was incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C followed by a final 1-min heating step at 99 °C. Real-time PCR was performed in glass capillaries using a Light Cycler™ system (Roche Diagnostics). Primer sequences and amplicon sizes are as follows: IL-6, 5′-acaacgatgatgcactt-3′ (forward) and 5′cttggtccttagccact-3′ (reverse) (334 bp); IκBα, 5′-gtgactttgggtgctg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gctgtatccgggtactt-3′ (reverse) (193 bp); PPARγ, 5′-tccgtagaagccgtgc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggatgtcctcgatggg-3′ (reverse) (364 bp); GAPDH, 5′-atcccagagctgaacg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaagtcgcaggagaca-3′ (reverse) (198 bp). For real-time PCR, 1 μl of reverse-transcribed cDNA was added in a total volume of 10 μl of PCR reaction buffer containing 1× LC-FastStart DNA Master Mix (Roche Applied Science), MgCl2 (4 μm), and forward and reverse primers (20 μm). The PCR program was one cycle of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 20 s. The amplified product was detected by the presence of a SYBR green fluorescent signal. Melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis was used to document the amplicon specificity. Calibration curves were generated by measuring serial dilutions of stock cDNA to calculate the amplification efficiency (E). The crossing point (Cp) of the log-linear portion of the amplification curve was determined. The relative induction of gene mRNA expression was determined using the calculation EΔCp (control samples - treated samples) and normalized for the expression of GAPDH mRNA (47Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (24575) Google Scholar). Triplicate samples were measured in duplicate and blotted as -fold increase between treated and untreated control samples. Western Blot Analysis—IEC were lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer, and 20–50 μg of protein was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Where indicated IEC cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132 (BioMol). Anti-IκBα (C21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-NF-κB RelA (Santa Cruz), anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser-32), anti-phospho-RelA (Ser-536), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (p44/p42) (Tyr-202/204), ERK1/2, anti-PPARγ (all antibodies from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-PP2A (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-β-actin (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) were used to detect immunoreactive phospho-IκBα, total IκBα, total RelA, phospho-RelA, phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, PPARγ, PP2A, and β-actin, respectively, using an enhanced chemiluminescence light-detecting kit (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (17Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Small Interference RNA and Transfection—Synthetic PPARγ-specific (accession number NM_011146) siRNA was designed and purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The sequence was as follows: sense, 5′-AGACCCAGCUCUACAACAG(TT)-3′; reverse 5′-CUGUUGUAGAGCUGGGUCU(TT)-3′. The annealed double stranded ribooligonucleotides were dissolved in RNase-free buffer and stored at -20 °C in a concentration of 20 μm. Before performing the experiments, the siRNA was heat-treated for 1 min at 90 °C and then incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C. CMT-93 cells, which were grown to 80–90% confluency, were transfected with single-stranded siRNA (0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 μg of total siRNA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer using TransMessanger reagent (Qiagen). Finally, the transfected CMT-93 cells were cultured for an additional 48 h and then stimulated with LPS (10 μg/ml) for 12 h in the presence or absence of 15d-PGJ2. Rhodamine-stained siRNA was used to visualize the cellular distribution in transfected CMT-93 epithelial monolayers using fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear Extracts and NF-κB p65 Protein/DNA Binding Activity— CMT-93 cells were stimulated for various times (0–4 h) with E. coli LPS (10 μg/ml), and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Extracts (5 μg) were used to determine nuclear RelA binding activity to the κB-nucleotide consensus sequence 5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′ by using the TransAM ELISA-based NF-κB transcription factor assay (Active Motif). Protein/oligonucleotide binding activity was quantified by colorimetric analysis using a MultiScan spectrophotometer. Co-immunoprecipitation and Phosphatase Activity Assay—CMT-93 cells were stimulated with either E. coli LPS (10 μg/ml) or 15d-PGJ2 (20 μm). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was precleared for 1 h with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa, Cruz, Europe). Total protein concentration was normalized, and immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C using 5 μl of rabbit anti-phospho-RelA and goat anti-PP2A antibody (Abcam). Immune complexes were collected with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 30 min, washed, and resuspended in reaction buffer (100 μl) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm dithiothreitol. To assay the phosphatase activity, 30 μl of beads from LPS-stimulated cells were co-incubated with 50 μl of beads from 15d-PGJ2-treated cells. Reactions were stopped after 1 and2hof incubation at 37 °C with the addition 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Western blot analysis for phospho-RelA and PP2A were carried out as described above. ELISA Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined in spent culture supernatants of IEC cultures using an ELISA technique. IL-6 protein production was determined by mouse-specific ELISA assay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Heidelberg, Germany). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicates. Statistical analysis was performed by the two-tailed Student's t test for paired data and considered significant if p values were <0.05 (*) or <0.01 (**). B. vulg"
https://openalex.org/W2090938988,"Telomere shortening in populations of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) that survive early replicative arrest (M0) by the inactivation of p16(INK4A) during cell culture on plastic dishes leads to a state of permanent replicative arrest termed senescence. While culture of HMECs on feeder layers abrogates M0 and p16(INK4A) inactivation, progressive telomere attrition in these cells also eventually results in permanent replicative arrest. Expression of telomerase prevents both senescence on plastic (S-P) and senescence on feeder layers (S-FL) in HMECs, as it does also in cultured primary human fibroblasts. We report here that the gene expression profiles of senescence in HMECs of the same lineage maintained under different culture conditions showed surprisingly little commonality. Moreover, neither of these senescence-associated profiles in HMECs resembles the profile for senescence in human fibroblasts. These results indicate that senescence-associated alterations in gene expression resulting from telomere attrition are affected by culture conditions as well as by cell origins, and argue that replicative senescence at the molecular level is a diverse rather than unique cellular process."
https://openalex.org/W2073768772,"In yeast, two different constitutive mutants of the G protein α subunit have been reported. Gpa1Q323L cannot hydrolyze GTP and permanently activates the pheromone response pathway. Gpa1N388D was also proposed to lack GTPase activity, yet it has an inhibitory effect on pheromone responsiveness. We have characterized this inhibitory mutant (designated GαND) and found that it binds GTP, interacts with G protein βγ subunits, and exhibits full GTPase activity in vitro. Although pheromone leads to dissociation of the receptor from wild-type G protein, the same treatment promotes stable association of the receptor with GαND. We conclude that agonist binding to the receptor promotes the formation of a nondissociable complex with GαND, and in this manner prevents activation of the endogenous wild-type G protein. Dominant-negative mutants may be useful in matching specific receptors and their cognate G proteins and in determining mechanisms of G protein signaling specificity.

Mammalian G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase. respond to a variety of signaling molecules, including hormones, neurotransmitters, odors, and light. These signals regulate diverse cellular processes, such as the control of blood pressure and heart rate, perception of pain, cell proliferation, inflammation, and platelet aggregation (1Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Upon binding of an agonist to its cognate receptor, the G protein α subunit transits from a GDP-bound to a GTP-bound state and liberates the G protein βγ subunit complex. The dissociated α (in the GTP-bound state) and βγ subunits then activate a variety of downstream effectors. Regulators of G protein signaling reverse this process by binding to Gα-GTP and promoting GTP hydrolysis, after which the subunits reassociate and signaling terminates (4Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). A prominent feature of G protein signaling is the tremendous diversity of the component proteins. Human genome analysis has revealed genes that encode several hundred candidate GPCRs, 16 α subunits, 5 β subunits, and 12 γ subunits (5Robishaw J.D. Berlot C.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further diversity results from alternative mRNA splicing and the potential of a given receptor to transduce signals to multiple G protein subunit subtypes and effectors. These signaling components do not assemble randomly; rather, one receptor typically activates only a subset of G protein heterotrimers, and the dissociated subunits activate only a subset of down-stream effectors (5Robishaw J.D. Berlot C.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Clearly, a major challenge is to define the coupling specificity of specific receptors, G proteins, and effectors. Bacterial toxins have long been used to perturb signaling mediated by susceptible G proteins. Cholera toxin catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gαs resulting in inactivation of its GTPase activity, thus maintaining Gαs in the active GTP-bound state. Pertussis toxin catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of Gαi, and this modification blocks G protein coupling to GPCRs (6Ribeiro-Neto F.A. Mattera R. Hildebrandt J.D. Codina J. Field J.B. Birnbaumer L. Sekura R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, pertussis toxin does not modify all members of the Gαi subfamily, and no toxins have been identified that modify members of the Gαq and Gα12 subfamilies. Thus, more general approaches are needed to analyze receptor and G protein coupling specificity. An alternative approach to studying G protein signal specificity has been to mutate residues in Gα critical for GTPase activity. One early example of an activated G protein allele was described by Landis et al. (7Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), who showed that certain types of human pituitary tumors are associated with GTPase-deficient mutants of Gαs. Another GTPase-deficient mutant replaces Gln-204 in Gαi (Gln-277 in Gαs and Gln-323 in Gpa1) (8Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

A crystal structure of Gα Q204Li and additional biochemical analysis suggest that the catalytic Gln acts by stabilizing the trigonal-bipyramidal transition state and by helping to orient the hydrolytic water molecule (11Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 12Kleuss C. Raw A.S. Lee E. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This mutation is widely used to identify signaling pathways activated by Gα subunits, and we recently used this approach to show that the yeast Gα subunit Gpa1 directly activates the mating response pathway, in conjunction with Gβγ (13Guo M.

Another approach is to inactivate G protein function by using mutants that confer a dominant-negative effect on signaling (14Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative mutants are proteins that disrupt the function of the endogenous wild-type protein when overexpressed. Thus, highly specific dominant-negative Gα proteins have tremendous potential for ascertaining the signaling specificity of diverse G proteins in complex systems.

In contrast to the large number and variety of mammalian GPCRs, only two distinct G protein signaling systems exist in yeast. The first regulates the response to mating pheromones, which are secreted by haploid a and α cell types in preparation for mating. Pheromone binding to receptors (e.g. Ste2 in a cells) triggers dissociation of Gα (Gpa1) from the Gβγ heterodimer (Ste4/Ste18). The dissociated subunits proceed to activate a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, resulting in new gene transcription, cell cycle arrest, and eventually cell fusion to form the a/α diploid (22Dohlman H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The second signaling pathway mediates the cellular response to glucose and environmental stressors such as high osmolarity and heat shock. Components of this pathway include the Gα protein Gpa2 working in conjunction with the putative glucose receptor Gpr1 (23Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Yun C.W. Tamaki H. Nakayama R. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent studies of Gpr1 signaling have identified two candidate Gβ subunits, Gpb1 and Gpb2, and a candidate Gγ, Gpg1 (25Batlle M.

Cell. 2002; 10: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Gpb1/2 proteins lack the seven WD40 repeats found in classical Gβ proteins, but instead contain seven kelch repeats implicated in protein-protein interaction (26Harashima T. Heitman J. Mol.

The effector for this G protein has not been positively identified, and generally speaking much less is known about this pathway. Two different constitutive mutants in the yeast Gα subunit have been described. Gpa1Q323L binds but does not hydrolyze GTP (13Guo M. Aston C. Burchett S.A. Dyke C. Fields S. Rajarao S.J. Uetz P.

We previously characterized the biochemical and physiological function of Gpa1Q323L (13Guo M. Aston C. Burchett S.A. Dyke C. Fields S. Rajarao S.J. Uetz P. Wang Y. Young K. Dohlman H.G. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and here we characterize the inhibitory GαND mutant. We report that GαND binds and hydrolyzes GTP but is unable to dissociate effectively from receptors and therefore acts as a potent dominant-negative inhibitor of receptor signaling. Strains, Media, and Plasmids—Established methods were used for the growth and genetic manipulation of bacteria and yeast (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain DH 5α was used for plasmid maintenance and amplification. The strains of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in this study are as follows: YPH499 (MATaleu2-Δ1 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63 ade2-101oclys2-801amura3-52), YPH501 (YPH499 MATa/α) (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), YGS5 (YPH499 gpa1::hisG ste11ts) (33Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), BY4741 (MATahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0; from Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), and a BY4741-derived gpa1 ste7 mutant strain (MATaste7::KanMX gpa1::hisG, provided by Paul Flanary, University of North Carolina). Yeast cells were grown in synthetic medium supplemented with adenine, amino acids, 2% glucose (SCD), or 2% galactose plus 0.2% sucrose (SCG) to express GAL1/10-inducible genes. Leucine, uracil, tryptophan, or histidine was omitted to maintain selection of plasmids as needed. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C unless otherwise stated. The absence of GPA1 in strain YGS5 normally results in constitutive Gβγ signaling and growth arrest; however, these cells can be maintained at 34 °C due to inactivation of the temperature-sensitive ste11 mutant. Several expression plasmids used in this study have been described previously: pRS315 (CEN, LEU2), pRS423 (2 μm, HIS3), pRS424 (2 μm, TRP1) (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pAD4M (2 μm, LEU2, ADH1 promoter and terminator), and pAD4M-GST and pAD4M-GPA1-GST (34Song J. Hirschman J. Gunn K. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20273-20283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). pGALH (2 μm, LEU2) and pGALL (2 μm, LEU2) contain partially active GAL1/10 promoter sequences having 18–20 (pGALH) or 1%(pGALH) full activity (35Giniger E. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (provided by Ming Guo, Yale University). pRS315-GPA1 contains the GPA1 gene under the control of the native promoter. Wild-type human Gαi2 in pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector was obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (Sayre, PA). The N270D mutation was introduced using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Alameda, CA). The mutant was amplified by PCR and ligated into pFastBacHta (Invitrogen) digested with BamHI and XhoI, which introduced an in-frame hexahistadine tag at the N terminus (His6-Gα N270Di2-pFastBacHta). Other Sf9 expression plasmids were described previously (36Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 37Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPA1Q323L, GPA1N388D, GPA2N365D, and Gα N270Di2 mutations were introduced using QuikChange. The primer sequences are as follows: 5′-TCGACGCTGGAGGCCTGCGTTCTGAACG-3′ and 5′-CGTTCAGAACGCAGGCCTCCAGCGTCGA-3′ for GPA1Q323L; 5′-CGTTTATTTTGTTTTTAGATAAAATTGATTTGTTC-3′ and 5′-GAACAAATCAATTTTATCTAAAAACAAAATAAACG-3′ for GPA1N388D; 5′-TCTGTCGTACTCTTTCTGGATAAAATCGACCTTTT TG-3′ and 5′-CAAAAAGGTCGATTTTATCCAGAAAGAGTACGACAGA-3′ for GPA2N365D; 5′-TCCATCATCCTCTTCCTCGACAAGAAGGACCTGTTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAACAGGTCCTTCTTGTCGAGGAAGAGGATGATGGA-3′ for Gα N270Di2. Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing analysis. Expression of Gβγ (Ste4/Ste18) was under the control of the bidirectional GAL1/10 promoter in pRS424-GAL-STE4/STE18. This plasmid was constructed by combining a SalI-EcoRI digestion product containing the GAL1/10 promoter and STE4 (from pL19, provided by Malcolm Whiteway, University of Montreal) (38Whiteway M. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with an EcoRI-SacI digestion product of STE18 amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GGGAATTCTAGGATAGTAGCAATCGCA-3′ and 5′-GAGGCTCTACGTAGCAAG-3′ and a SalI-SacI digestion product of plasmid pRS424. Expression of STE2 or STE7 was achieved by PCR amplification and subcloning into the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (2 μm, URA3, GAL1/10 promoter, CYC1 terminator; Invitrogen). Amplification primers used were 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCAGAATGTCTGATGCGGCTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTAAATTATTATTATCTTCAGTC-3′ for STE2; 5′-GCATCGGATCATATCTGTTT-3′ and 5′-GCTGGAAAAAGAAGAGACTA-3′ for STE7. A stretch of double-stranded DNA encoding three tandem repeats of the FLAG tag (sense, 5′-GATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAGGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAGGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAG-3′) in pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO was digested with HindIII and ligated to HindIII-digested STE2 that had been PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCAGAATGTCTGATGCGGCTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTAAATTATTATTATCTTCAGTC-3′, yielding pYES-STE2-FLAG. Expression of Gα NDi2 in Insect Cells—A baculovirus encoding human Gα N270Di2 with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was prepared and amplified using plasmid his6-Gα N270Di2-pFastBacHta according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Four liters of Sf9 cells at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and harvested 48 h after infection by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 400 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 9.8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mm GDP, 500 nm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 nm pepstatin, 10 μm l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone) and lysed by passage through a pressurized Emulsiflux (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). The lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min to remove intact cells and nuclei. The cleared lysate was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 35 min in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The resulting supernatant fraction was passed over an equilibrated 2.5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose resin (Qiagen) column at a flow rate of ∼2 ml/min, and the flow-through was reapplied to the column. The column was washed with 10 ml of high salt wash (cell lysis buffer + 300 mm NaCl), and 10 ml of 10 mm imidizole in cell lysis buffer. His-Gα N270Di2 was eluted with 10 ml of 150 mm imidazole in cell lysis buffer, diluted 1:4 in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01 mm GDP, 500 nm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 nm pepstatin, 10 μm l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone), and loaded onto an equilibrated 1-ml HiTrap Q-Sepharose FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl (30 ml) was used to elute proteins bound to the column. Five hundred microliter fractions were collected and immediately assayed for [35S]GTPγS binding and GTPase activity. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—[35S]GTPγS binding assays were performed in triplicate in conical polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt) in a 100-μl reaction volume. Fifty microliters of each sample was added to 50 μl of 2× GTPγS binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μm GTPγS, 500,000 cpm/reaction [35S]GTPγS) and incubated ina30 °C water bath for 60 min. Reactions were then transferred to ice and diluted with 5 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl). The diluted reactions were filtered over pre-wetted 0.45-μm type HA nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) using a vacuum manifold and washed twice with 5 ml of stop buffer. The filters were then added to scintillation vials with scintillant, and radioactivity was determined using a scintillation counter. GTPase Activity—Steady state GTPase assays were performed in duplicate in conical polypropylene tubes in a 50-μl reaction volume. Twenty five microliters of each sample was added to 25 μlof2× GTPase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 4 μm GTP, 625,000 cpm/reaction [γ-32P]GTP) and incubated in a 30 °C water bath for 30 min. To terminate the reaction, the tubes were moved to an ice bath, and 950 μl of suspended 5% activated charcoal (Sigma) in 20 mm NaH2PO4 was added to each tube. The reaction tubes were subjected to centrifugation at 3,000 × g in a swinging bucket centrifuge for 10 min to collect the charcoal pellet. Six hundred microliters of the cleared supernatant were transferred to scintillation vials with scintillation fluid for quantification of radioactivity. Pheromone Signaling Assays—Two outcomes of pheromone signaling were measured. The first was pheromone-dependent growth inhibition (halo assay) (39Hoffman G. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of a saturated cell culture was mixed with 2 ml of water and 2 ml of 1% (w/v) dissolved agar (55 °C) and poured onto selective SCD or SCG agar plates. Synthetic α-factor was spotted onto sterile paper disks and placed on the nascent lawn. The resulting zone of growth inhibition was recorded after 48 h. The second assay was pheromone-dependent reporter transcription activity (39Hoffman G. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this method a pheromone-inducible promoter (FUS1) drives expression of a reporter enzyme (β-galactosidase) (39Hoffman G. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A saturated cell culture in selective SCD medium was diluted 1:200 in fresh SCD medium, allowed to grow overnight, washed, and resuspended in SCG medium to A600 nm ∼0.6. After 4 h the cells were aliquoted (90 μl, in triplicate) to 96-well plates containing 10 μlof α-factor and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by adding 20 μl of a freshly prepared solution of 83 μm fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside (Marker Gene Technologies Inc.), 137.5 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubating at 37 °C until a bright yellow color appeared. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μlof1 m Na2CO3, and the fluorescence activity was monitored using an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 530 nm. Heat Shock Assay—A saturated cell culture in selective SCD medium was diluted 1:20 into fresh SCD medium and incubated for 48 h. Cell cultures were then transferred to glass tubes and placed in a 50 °C water bath for 45 min. Heat-shocked (50 °C) and nonheat-shocked (30 °C) cells were diluted and plated on selective SCG agar plates. Surviving cell colonies were counted after 2–3 days (23Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Gpa1 and Gpa1N388D Expression Assay—To compare expression of Gpa1 versus Gpa1N388D, protein concentration was examined in the gpa1Δ deletion YGS5 strain and in the diploid YPH501 strain, which normally does not express the receptor or G protein. To assess regulation by pheromone, α-factor (2.5 μm) was added at A600 nm ∼0.6 and incubation continued for an additional 2 h. Cells were grown to mid-log phase in SCG (A600 nm ∼1.0), and cell growth was stopped by addition of 10 mm (final concentration) NaN3. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Cells were washed once with 10 mm NaN3 and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3. Cells were then lysed by vortexing with glass beads four times for 1 min each and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s. The resulting supernatant was collected and mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 14.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 4% SDS) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The samples were allowed to cool and subjected to immunoblotting analysis (see below). To compare stability of Gpa1 and Gpa1N388D, cycloheximide was added (10 μg/ml final concentration) for various times prior to harvesting the cells. Co-purification of Gpa1 with Gβγ—YPH501 cells expressing receptor (Ste2), Gβγ (Ste4/Ste18), and either Gα (Gpa1) or GαND (Gpa1N388D) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST alone were grown in selective SCG medium. All the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. After termination of cell growth, 50 A600 nm units of cells were resuspended in purification lysis buffer (40 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm 4-[2-aminoethyl]benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm glycerol 2-phosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cells were split into two equal portions, and each portion was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 3 mm MgCl2 and 10 μm GDP (condition 1, “–AlF–4”) or 3 mm MgCl2,10 μm GDP, 30 μm AlCl3, and 10 mm NaF (condition 2, “+AlF–4”). Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads four times for 1 min each. The resultant lysates were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min and solubilized by addition of Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) and rocking for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of a 30% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in the appropriate lysis buffer (condition 1 or condition 2) and incubated for 2 h. The glutathione-Sepharose 4B was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The bound proteins were eluted by heating at 100 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Co-immunoprecipitation of Receptor (Ste2) and Gpa1—YPH501 cells expressing Gβγ (Ste4/Ste18), Gpa1, or Gpa1N388D and receptor (Ste2) tagged or nontagged with the FLAG epitope were grown in selective SCG medium to A600 nm ∼1.0. All the following procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Twenty five A600 nm units of cells were resuspended in IP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× of protease inhibitor mixture (catalog number 1873580; Roche Applied Science)), followed by vortexing with glass beads four times for 1 min each. Cell lysates were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to 1 h of rocking to liberate membrane-bound proteins. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of EZview™ Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). After2hof gentle agitation, the gel was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s and washed three times with IP lysis buffer. Elution of FLAG-tagged protein was achieved by incubating the gel with 15 μg of 3× FLAG peptide in 50 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with gentle shaking for 30 min. Supernatant was harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 30 s and subjected to immunoblotting assay. Immunoblot Detection—Protein samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies against Gpa1 (1:1,000 dilution) (40Dohlman H.G. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A.M. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9688-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), FLAG (1: 3,000; Sigma), GST (1:1,500; from Joan Steitz, Yale University), Ste4 (1:2,000; from Duane Jenness, University of Massachusetts), or Gαi2 (1:2,500; Qiagen). Antibodies were detected using secondary antibodies such as horseradish peroxidase-conjugate goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). The signal was detected by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GαND Can Bind and Hydrolyze GTP—Gpa1N388D is a potent inhibitor of pheromone signaling. Other investigators have suggested that this mutation impairs GTPase function and proposed that the inhibition of signaling might occur through activation of a “desensitization effector” (28Cismowski M.J. Metodiev M. Draper E. Stone D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Metodiev M. Matheos D. Rose M.D. Stone D.E.

Hirsch J.P. Dietzel C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the GTPase activity of the ND mutant has not been measured in any system. A previous attempt to purify recombinant Gpa1N388D from bacteria yielded a product unable to hydrolyze GTP, but which was also unable to bind to GTP or Gβγ (28Cismowski M.J. Metodiev M. Draper E. Stone D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the mutant protein is unstable and loses activity during purification. As an alternative strategy we attempted to purify the analogous mutant form of Gαi2 expressed in insect cells. Gαi is the closest mammalian homologue to Gpa1; both proteins have nearly identical guanine nucleotid"
https://openalex.org/W2035441480,"Memapsin 2 (β-secretase) is the protease that initiates cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Both APP and memapsin 2 are Type I transmembrane proteins and are endocytosed into endosomes where APP is cleaved by memapsin 2. Separate endocytic signals are located in the cytosolic domains of these proteins. We demonstrate here that the addition of the ectodomain of memapsin 2 (M2ED) to cells transfected with native APP or APP Swedish mutant (APPsw) resulted in the internalization of M2ED into endosomes with increased Aβ production. These effects were reduced by treatment with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The nontransfected parental cells had little internalization of M2ED. The internalization of M2ED was dependent on the endocytosis signal in APP, because the expression of a mutant APP that lacks its endocytosis signal failed to support M2ED internalization. These results suggest that exogenously added M2ED interacts with the ectodomain of APP on the cell surface leading to the internalization of M2ED, supported by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. The interactions between the two proteins is not due to the binding of substrate APPsw to the active site of memapsin 2, because neither a potent active site binding inhibitor of memapsin 2 nor an antibody directed to the β-secretase site of APPsw had an effect on the uptake of M2ED. In addition, full-length memapsin 2 and APP, immunoprecipitated together from cell lysates, suggested that the interaction of these two proteins is part of the native cellular processes.

Because Aβ occupies such a central role in AD pathogenesis, the cellular mechanism of its genesis and the therapeutic means of its reduction are active areas of current research. Aβ, a 40/42-residue peptide, is derived from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a Type I membrane protein (see Fig. 1), by two proteases known as β-secretase and γ-secretase. The activity of γ-secretase is associated with a membrane protein complex consisting of presenilin-1, nicastrin, and other proteins (3Wolfe M.S. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 4: 371-383Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). β-Secretase was identified to be a membrane-anchored aspartic protease named memapsin 2 (4Lin X. Koelsch G. Wu S. Downs D. Dashti A.

Memapsin 2 is also a Type I transmembrane protein, consisting of a catalytic ectodomain (M2ED), a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic domain (Fig. 1).

The native APP is a poor substrate of memapsin 2 as judged by kinetic parameters (4Lin X. Koelsch G. Wu S. Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

The Swedish mutation at the P2-P1 positions, from Lys-Met to Asn-Leu, enhances the catalytic efficiency by about 60-fold, increases Aβ production, and manifests an early onset form of AD. The specificity of memapsin 2 for all eight substrate residues has been determined previously (15Turner R.T. Kolesch G. Hong L. Castenheira P. Ghosh A. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10001-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Memapsin 2 is glycosylated by three N-linked oligosaccharides (16Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J.

Memapsin 2 and APP are both located in “lipid rafts” on the cell surface where, at pH 7, memapsin 2 has only residual activity. Both proteins are endocytosed into the endosomes, the major site for the hydrolysis of APP by memapsin 2 (9Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M. Kaiser H. Meyer C. Walter J. Lammich S. Multhaup G. Haass C.

The intracellular domain of memapsin 2 contains a signal motif that binds three GGA proteins (17He X. Chang W.-P. Koelsch G. Tang J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12174-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This interaction apparently serves to package memapsin 2 into clathrin-coated vesicles for transportation in the endocytic or/and recycling pathways (17He X. Chang W.-P. Koelsch G. Tang J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that memapsin 2 and APP are in close contact on the cell surface and throughout the endocytic process (23Kinoshita A. Fukumoto H. Shah T. Whelan C.M. Irizarry M.C. Hyman B.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3339-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the cell surface organization involving memapsin 2 may be important in the mechanism and regulation of memapsin 2 endocytosis, and contacts of other proteins with the catalytic domain of memapsin 2 may indeed play an important role in this process. We have therefore carried out a study of the endocytosis of exogenously added M2ED. Here we report that the recombinant M2ED is endocytosed, and this process requires the presence of APP at the cell surface. The internalized M2ED, localized mainly in endosomes, catalyzed the production of Aβ. Cell Culture and Transfection—Two cell lines were used in the studies reported herein. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 IU/ml and 10,000 μg/ml, Cellgro), designated as complete DMEM. HeLa cells were used in all cell imaging experiments, whereas HEK293 cells were used whenever the overexpression of APP and memapsin 2 were needed for determination of APP degradation products. Human native APP (APPwt) and Swedish mutant APP (APPsw) were cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as APPwt/pcDNA and APPsw/pcDNA, respectively. The APP mutant lacking the endocytic motif GYENPTY (APP-s) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using APPsw/pcDNA as template. Full-length memapsin 2 (pro-M2) was cloned into pSecTag (Invitrogen) as M2/pSecTag. HEK293 or HeLa cells were stably transfected with APPsw/pcDNA and/or M2/pSecTag designated as 293/APPsw or 293/APPsw/M2, respectively. HeLa cells were stably transfected with APPsw/pcDNA designated as HeLa/APPsw. Antibiotic G418 in the concentration of 125 μg/ml was included in the media for maintenance of the stably transfected lines. For transient transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded on 6-well plates, cultivated to 90-95% confluence, and 0.5 μg of APPwt/pcDNA, APPsw/pcDNA, APP-s/pcDNA, or empty vector (pcDNA3.1) were transfected for 24 h. Both stable and transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Fluorescence Labeling of M2EDand Culture Incubation—For fluorescent labeling of M2ED and pro-M2, fast protein liquid chromatography-purified recombinant M2ED and pro-M2ED (12Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wus S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) were separately dialyzed with 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.3, and labeled with either Alexa 488 fluorescent dye using an Alexa Fluor 488 protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes) or Cy3 using Cy3 Mono-reactive Dye Pack (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Labeled M2ED and pro-M2 retained its specific activity as compared with the native protease (results not shown) when assayed with a fluorogenic substrate (14Ermolieff J. Loy J.A. Koelsch G. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12450-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating that the modification did not significantly alter their three-dimensional structure. For cellular uptake of Alexa 488-labeled M2ED, parental or APP-transfected HeLa cells were separately seeded on Lab-Tek™ 8-well chamber slides in complete DMEM or supplemented with 125 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C for 48 h. When about 70% confluent, the cells were washed once with pre-warmed DMEM, then 0.2 ml of a solution containing 9 μg of Alexa 488-labeled recombinant M2ED was added to each well and incubated for 30, 60, or 120 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3 times, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, and mounted by Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc.) for observation with confocal microscopy. When the β-secretase inhibitor OM00-3 was used, Alexa 488-labeled M2ED (1 μm) was preincubated with OM00-3 (12.4 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C before adding to cells. The inhibition constant of OM00-3 for M2ED at pH 7.0 was determined using the previously described method (15Turner R.T. Kolesch G. Hong L. Castenheira P. Ghosh A. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10001-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The internalization of Alexa 488-labeled recombinant M2ED also was studied by flow cytometry as follows. APP-transfected 293 cells were seeded in T75 flasks (Nunc™, Denmark) and maintained in complete DMEM with 125 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C. At 90% confluency, the cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of Opti-MEM I medium (GIBCO™, Invitrogen) and equally divided into four parts onto 35- × 10-mm dishes (about 4 × 106 cells/dish). Each part was supplemented with 0 or 42 μg of Alexa 488-labeled recombinant M2ED and/or 0 or 2.5 units of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein (PI-PLC) and incubated at 37 °C or 4 °C, in the dark for 2 h each. Cells were washed with ice-cold 0.05% Tween 20/PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS on ice for flow cytometric analysis (FACSCalibur). For FRET experiment, HeLa/APPsw cells were incubated with 7 μg of M2ED-Cy3 in 0.2 ml of complete DMEM, and the rest of the procedure is the same as described above. Subcellular Localization Experiments—APPsw-transfected HeLa cells were grown on 8-well chamber slides to 70% confluence and then were incubated with Alexa 488-labeled M2ED for 2 h as described above. Cells were rinsed with PBS three times, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, and permeabilized for 6 min with PBST (PBS with 0.2% Tween 20). Cells were incubated with 5% host serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific protein binding sites and incubated for an additional 1 h with the respective primary antibodies against the following proteins: an early endosome marker EEA1 (in 1:2000 dilution, BD Biosciences), an endoplasmic reticulum marker, Bip/GRP78 (in 1:1500 dilution, BD Biosciences), a trans-Golgi network marker p230 (in 1:1500 dilution, BD Biosciences), and an anti-APP antibody, MAB1560 (in 1:700 dilution, Chemicon). The dilutions were carried out in 1% corresponding host serum in PBS. After extensive washes, Cy3-conjugated secondary sheep anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) was added. The cells were incubated for an additional 1 h, followed by extensive washes, and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium. Cellular images were collected with an LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss) using multiple photomultiplier tubes regulated by LSM510 software. Alexa 488-labeled M2ED was excited at 488 nm, and emission was recorded at 505-530 nm. Cy3 was excited at 543 nm, and emission was recorded at 560 nm. The captured images for the red and green channels were merged, with the appearance of yellow being indicative of colocalization. Internalization of M2EDby Cells Treated with Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific Phospholipase C—HeLa cells transfected with APPsw were grown in 8-well chamber slides to about 70% confluency then incubated with 0 or 2.5 units/ml of PI-PLC (Molecular Probes) in Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 2 h. The incubation of Alexa 488-labeled M2ED and the observation of cell-associated fluorescence were carried out as described above. Cellular Production of Soluble APP, C-terminal Fragment, and Aβ—HEK293 cells stably transfected with APPsw were methionine deprived for 1 h in a methionine-free DMEM (Cellgro) with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (starvation DMEM). The cells were incubated with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S Label, MP Biomedicals) in starvation DMEM (without methionine or cysteine) in the presence or absence of 85 μg/ml of recombinant M2ED or pro-M2ED. After 6-h incubation at 37 °C, supernatant was collected, and cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 1% Nonidet P-40) with a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 μm pepstatin, and 0.23 unit/ml aprotinin) for 20 min on ice, followed by passing through a 21-gauge needle 10 times. The lysates were centrifuging at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad). Supernatant and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated, respectively, with anti-myc antibody (Rockland), anti-APP antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) against N-terminal 100 amino acids, and MAB1561 (Chemicon) against residues17-24 of Aβ for detection of C-terminal fragment (CTF), soluble APP (sAPP), and Aβ. Antibody complex captured with 20 μl of protein-G-agarose beads (Sigma) were resolved by electrophoresis on 10-20% gradient Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Gels were soaked in a fixation solution (20% methanol and 10% acetic acid) for 30 min followed by amplification solution Amplify NAMP100V (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h then dried and exposed to BioMax film (Kodak). FRET Experiments—Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was studied using the acceptor photobleaching method (24Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) in which FRET induced an increase in fluorescence of the donor, anti-APP antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 (anti-APP-Alexa 488), as a consequence of the photobleaching of the acceptor, M2ED conjugated to Cy3 (M2ED-Cy3), was measured. APPsw-transfected HeLa cells grown in chamber slides were incubated with Cy3-labeled M2ED, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized as described above. For APP detection, monoclonal antibody against APP, MAB1560, was labeled using the Alexa 488 Zenon® labeling kit (Molecular Probes), which specifically labeled the Fab fragment of the antibody. The extent of labeling was controlled, so the donor fluorescence intensity was considerable lower than that of the acceptor. The use of fluorescently labeled Fab fragments was essential, because the whole IgG secondary antibodies failed to result in a FRET signal. Cells were incubated with 1 μg of Alexa 488-labeled anti-APP antibody in 5% normal goat serum/PBS at room temperature for 2 h. After washing five times with PBS, the cells were mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS. FRET imaging was performed using a Nikon C1 confocal scanning head mounted on a Nikon TE 2000 inverted microscope equipped with argon and He-Ne green light lasers (emission lines: 488 nm and 568 nm, respectively). For photobleaching the He-Ne laser was used at its maximum power. Consecutive images were acquired of donor and acceptor before bleaching using low laser energy. Thereafter, the M2ED-Cy3-stained cells were bleached in a region of interest by repeated scanning with the full power 568-nm laser line for 6-8 min, which bleached 40-60% of the Cy3 fluorochrome. Post-bleached images were acquired by reverting back to the original settings. All measurements were obtained using a 60 × 1.4 numerical aperture objective, and samples labeled with the donor and acceptor alone were used to check the cross-over between the fluorophores. The gain of the photomultiplier tubes was adjusted so as to eliminate cross-talk and to achieve the best possible dynamic range. Pixel-by-pixel image analysis and intensity measurements were performed using ImageJ version 1.3 public domain software. Two types of negative controls were used: (a) an internal negative control (non-bleached areas of the microscopic field) and (b) cells with donor in the absence of the acceptor (M2ED-Cy3 only). When the acceptor was omitted, no enhancement of donor signal after photobleaching was observed. In addition, no FRET signal was detected when the Cy3-labeled Fab fragments were replaced with labeled whole IgG, suggesting that two IgG layers (the primary and secondary antibodies) increase the distance between fluorophores, and therefore FRET no longer occurs. This observation provides additional proof that the detected FRET signal accurately reflects the proximity of the two fluorophores. Immunoprecipitation of APP and Full-length Memapsin 2 from Cell Lysates—Parental 293 and 293/M2/APPsw cells were separately grown to 90% confluence in T75 flasks. The cells were treated with 0 or 2.0 units/ml of PI-PLC in Opti-MEM I medium at 37 °C for 2 h, then washed with PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors and 1% saponin (Calbiochem) for 20 min on ice. Total cell lysates were collected by centrifuging at maximum rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, divided into two parts, and immunoprecipitated with anti-APP antibody MAB1561 and anti-memapsin 2 antibody 195102 (Calbiochem) against residues 487-501 of human memapsin 2. The antibody complexes captured on protein-G beads were eluted in sample loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (16% Tris-Tricine gel) and Western blotting with antibody 195102 or antibody MAB1561, respectively, following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Control blots of washed protein-G beads without added antibodies for immunoprecipitation produced very low nonspecific bands (results not shown), thus the specific immunoprecipitated bands are readily identifiable in this system. Endocytosis of Exogenously Added M2EDinto HeLa Cells Is Dependent on APPsw Expression—Recombinant M2ED, covalently conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorescent dye, was incubated with HeLa cells with or without transfection of APPsw. After 2 h, the cells were fixed and observed with confocal microscopy for the green fluorescence of the dye-conjugated M2ED. In native HeLa cells, little fluorescence was found to be associated with the cells, with only a few positive sites present on the cell surface (Fig. 2A). Cells transfected with a blank vector did not increase the cell-associated fluorescence (results not shown). For HeLa cells transfected with APPsw, intense punctate fluorescent areas were observed inside cells (Fig. 2B) and the intracellular fluorescence increased with the duration of incubation (Fig. 2C). The expression of native APP also stimulated the internalization of M2ED (see below). Similar results were also obtained when HEK293 cells were used (results not shown). To confirm the above observations, HEK293 cells were chosen (see “Discussion”) for experiments using flow cytometric analysis. HEK293 cells expressing APPsw manifested significantly higher cell-associated fluorescence after incubation at 37 °C with Alexa 488-labeled M2ED than did the native cells (Fig. 3). Incubation of 293/APPsw cells and M2ED at 4 °C had only marginal increase of cellular fluorescence (Fig. 3), because endocytosis is impeded at this low temperature. These findings suggest that exogenously added M2ED was internalized into the cells, and such process was facilitated by the presence of APPsw.Fig. 3M2ED internalization and the effect of PI-PLC analyzed by flow cytometry. HEK293 cells stably transfected with APPsw were incubated in the presence or absence of 2.5 units/ml PI-PLC at either 37 °C (A) or on ice (B), for 2 h, followed by an additional 2-h incubation with either 0 or 42 μg of Alexa 488-M2ED at the indicated temperatures. Cells were then washed extensively with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS for flow cytometric analysis (FACSCalibur). Data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Endocytosis of Exogenously Added M2EDDoes Not Require an Available Active Site of Memapsin 2—We examined the possibility that APPsw facilitated endocytosis of the added M2ED by the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex. Such a complex would require the availability of memapsin 2 substrate binding site and the APPsw region near the β-secretase cutting site. Therefore, we studied the effect on M2ED internalization into HeLa cells by either a memapsin 2 inhibitor or an antibody directed at the β-secretase site of APPsw. Inhibitor OM00-3 is very potent (Ki = 0.3 nm at pH 4.5 (14Ermolieff J. Loy J.A. Koelsch G. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12450-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)) and occupies all eight subsites in the memapsin 2 active-site cleft (12Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wus S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). At pH 7.0, the pH of the culture medium, OM00-3 has a Ki of 1.1 μm. The inhibitor did not significantly alter the uptake of Alexa 488-labeled M2ED by HeLa/APPsw cells (Fig. 2D), at about 12× molar excess to M2ED (calculated to abolish 92% of the proteolytic activity). Monoclonal antibody 1560, which recognizes residues 1-17 of Aβ, including subsites P1′ to P4′ at the β-secretase site of APPsw, was then tested for blocking of the binding of M2ED to this site of APPsw. The inclusion of this antibody did not change the uptake of exogenously added M2ED (Fig. 2E). These observations suggest that the APPsw-mediated uptake of M2ED does not require the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex involving the active site of memapsin 2. Internalized M2EDColocalized Mainly with Endosomes and APP—To determine the subcellular localization of internalized M2ED, APPsw-expressing HeLa cells were incubated for 2 h with Alexa 488-conjugated M2ED then permeabilized and stained with antibodies directed for resident proteins of various subcellular compartments. Confocal microscopy observed little colocalization between M2ED and endoplasmic reticulum marker protein BiP (Fig. 4A). Likewise, limited colocalization was seen for Golgi marker p230 (Fig. 4B). Strong colocalization involving much of the cytosol area was observed for early endosome marker EEA1 (Fig. 4C). With a shorter incubation (1 h) but otherwise the same experiment"

In vertebrates, the FGF superfamily comprises 22 members. In non-vertebrates, six FGF genes have been identified in Ciona intestinalis, three in Drosophila melanogaster, and two (let-756 and egl-17) in Caenorhabditis elegans. The core of LET-756 shares a 30-50% sequence identity with the various members of the superfamily. The relationships between vertebrate and non-vertebrate FGFs are not clear. We made chimeric FGFs by replacing the core region of LET-756 by the cores of various mammalian, fly, and worm FGFs. LET-756 deleted in its core region was no longer able to rescue the lethal phenotype of a let-756 null mutant, and only chimeras containing the cores of FGFs 9, 16, and 20 showed rescue capacity. This core contains an internal motif of six amino acid residues (EFISIA) whose deletion or mutation abolished both the rescue activity and FGF secretion in the supernatant of transfected COS-1 cells. Chimera containing the core of C. intestinalis FGF9/16/20, a potential ortholog of FGF9 lacking the complete EFISIA motif, was not able to rescue the lethal phenotype or be secreted. However, the introduction of the EFISIA motif restored both activities. The data show that the EFISIA motif in the core of LET-756 is essential for its biological activity and that FGFs 9, 16, and 20, which contain that motif, are functionally close to LET-756 and may be evolutionary related.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This role has been established through a series of studies on animal models and identification of human hereditary skeletal disorders that are associated with mutations of the tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (2De Moerlooze L.

To speak only of fully sequenced genomes, three Fgf genes are known in Drosophila melanogaster (4Sutherland D. Samakovlis C.

Phylogenetic analysis allows classification of FGFs in several families that separated early during the evolution of bilaterians (8Satou Y. Imai K.S. Satoh N. Dev.

Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-12Crossref Google Scholar). In the human genome, the FGF families are included into distinct sets of paralogous chromosomal regions (13Popovici C. Leveugle M. Birnbaum D. Coulier F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This classification is associated with the structural and functional properties of FGFs. For example, the FGF homologous factors (FHF), which in contrast to all other FGFs, exert their function by ways independent of the FGF receptors (14Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Olsen S.K. Garbi M. Zampieri N. Eliseenkova A.V. Ornitz D.M. Goldfarb M. Mohammadi M. J. Biol.

However, this analysis is not conclusive for the non-vertebrate FGFs and does not allow us to establish a direct phylogenic relationship between human, fly, and worm FGFs. To understand the importance of FGF expansion and the phylogenetic and/or functional relationships that may exist between vertebrate and non-vertebrate FGFs, we studied C. elegans LET-756/FGF as a model. The purpose was to assess whether this worm FGF could be related to any particular FGF family despite the limitation of the phylogenetic analysis. Bioinformatic Methods—All of the FGF sequences used for this study were from GenBank™ with the exception of the D. melanogaster thisbe (TH1) and pyramus (PYR) sequences, which have been reported recently (5Stathopoulos A.

The boundaries of core regions were determined by SMART (16Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) and then aligned using ClustalX (17Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35492) Google Scholar) and by the human eye (see supplementary data for the alignments of the various FGFs). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using both maximum parsimony and bootstrapped neighbor-joining techniques. Branch support for the best-fitting tree was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Alignments, bootstrap analysis, and neighborhood-joining trees were carried out at default parameters. Eukaryotic Cells and C. elegans Cells Expression Vectors—The strategy for cloning eukaryotic and C. elegans expression vectors is depicted in Fig. 1A. Additional details are given as supplementary material, and the sequences of the primers used to amplify the various FGF fragments are available upon request. The coding region of let-756, FGF-E, and FGF9 was amplified with F1-R1 primers (containing BamHI and BglII restriction sites) and inserted in the BglII/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2-eukaryotic cell expression vector (underlined restriction sites shown in Fig. 1 are introduced by mutagenesis). The cores of various FGFs are amplified with F2-R2 primers (using as template the FGF coding region inserted in a cloning vector) and introduced in the plet containing the BssHII and SpeI restriction sites. The cDNA fragments containing the N-terminal core or core C-terminal coding regions are amplified with F3-R2 and F2-R3 primers and inserted by using NheI/SpeI and BssHII/XmaI restriction sites, respectively. The mutagenized core regions made in the eukaryotic cell expression vector are transferred in the C. elegans expression vector by using the PvuI/SacI restriction sites. The chimeric constructs allowing the expression in mammalian cells are designated PCMV::let-756[FGFn]let-756::gfp in which in the bracketed region is the core-coding region and n stands for different FGFs as follows: mammalian FGF2/3/5-9/12/16/20/21; C. intestinalis Fgf8/17/18, Fgf9/16/20, and Fgf11/12/13/14 (referred to as Fgf-D, Fgf-E, and Fgf-F, respectively); C. elegans let-756 and egl-17; and D. melanogaster bnl. The C. elegans expression vectors are designated accordingly with the exception that Plet-756 for the let-756 promoter replaces PCMV. Other denominations are as follows. The constructs containing the N-terminal and core-coding regions of FGF9 fused to the C-terminal coding region of let-756 is PCMV::FGF9[FGF9]let-756::gfp, and the constructs containing N-terminal coding region of let-756 fused to the core and C-terminal coding regions of FGF9 is PCMV::let-756[FGF9]FGF9::gfp. Mutations or deletions in the FGF molecule are indicated as exposants. As an example, the constructs deleted for the EFISIA-coding region are referred as PCMV::let-756ΔEFVSVA::gfp or PCMV::let-756[FGF9ΔEFVSVA]let-756::gfp. Nematode Culture and Transformation Rescue Experiments—C. elegans Bristol (N2) strain nematodes were cultured using standard techniques (18Wood W.B. the Community of C. elegans Researchers The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). let-756-rescuing activity was assayed by injecting tester DNA at 50 ng/μl into gravid s2887 strain hermaphrodites, establishing transformed lines and scoring the Dpy progeny for a viable phenotype. The s2887 allele used in these experiments was generated on a dpy-17(e164) unc-32(e189) chromosome after UV irradiation (19Stewart H.I. O'Neil N.J. Janke D.L. Franz N.W. Chamberlin H.M. Howell A.M. Gilchrist E.J. Ha T.T. Kuervers L.M. Vatcher G.P. Danielson J.L. Baillie D.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 280-288PubMed Google Scholar) in which sDp3, a portion of chromosome III, balances the lethal phenotype of the s2887 strain. The tester DNA was co-injected with the pPD95.86 vector (a gift of A. Fire) in which GFP is driven by the myo-3 promoter, such that Unc F1 positive for GFP was isolated and the rescue activity was tested for the presence in the progeny of live Dpy animals expressing GFP. Conversely, the absence of rescue activity was assessed by the isolation of Dpy GFP-positive animals (containing the myo-3 marker associated with the tester FGF), which fail to develop to the fertile stage and thus are unable to establish a strain. Homozygous (free of sDp3) Dpy GFP-positive animals were further genotyped for the presence of the inversion characteristic of the s2887 strain by PCR on a single worm. The following primer pairs were used: (i) one in the first exon and one in intron 3, which do not amplify if animals are free of the sDp3 or do not result from sDp3 recombination and (ii) one in the first exon and one in the R13A5 cosmid, which detect the inversion occurring in let-756. The sequences of the primers can be obtained upon request. We also determined that, in the progeny of the rescued Dpy, some animals die because of the absence of the array. Conversely, the absence of rescue activity was assessed by the isolation of Dpy GFP-positive animals (containing the myo-3 marker associated with the tester FGF), which fail to develop to the fertile stage and thus are unable to establish a strain. The tester DNA was also co-injected with the pRF4 plasmid in wild type worms, and transformants were selected for their roller phenotype. Microscopy—F1 GFP-expressing nematodes were selected under a stereomicroscope (Leica MZ6) equipped with a GFP fluorescence module. When necessary, individual nematodes were picked from plates onto 2% agar pads containing 10 μl of 1 mm levamisole as an anesthetic and observed with a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope. Transfected COS-1 were grown on coverslips, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and mounted in Dako. In some experiments, fixed cells were incubated with anti-giantin antibodies (a gift of H. F. Hauri, Biozentrum) followed by Texas Red-coupled secondary antibodies. Western Blot—To assay secreted proteins, a 48-h conditioned medium from COS-1-transfected cells were collected, cleared by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). To study cell-associated proteins, lysates from transfected cells were, depending on the experiment, either immunoprecipitated or boiled for 5 min in 2% SDS. Total cell lysates and anti-GFP immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and, after blotting, revealed by anti-mouse anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science). The signal was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and ECL kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Brefeldin A was used at a 2.5 μg/ml concentration, and tunicamycin was used at 5 μg/ml. Identification of FGF Gene Families—FGF sequences share identity and similarity in a central core region of the molecule (10Coulier F. Pontarotti P. Roubin R. Hartung H. Goldfarb M. Birnbaum D. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We constructed a phylogenetic tree of the FGF core sequences (Fig. 2). The tree included core sequences from human, C. intestinalis, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans FGFs. We added the FGF15 mouse sequence, because it is not present in the human genome, whereas reciprocally, FGF19 is not found in the mouse. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the distance matrix (Blosum 30 matrix) and neighbor-joining algorithms implemented in ClustalW. A total of 1000 bootstrapped replicates were run. The tree showed that the FGF superfamily could be divided into seven evolutionary divergent families: A (FGF1/2); B (FGF4/6); C (FGF7/10/22); D (FGF8/17/18); E (FGF9/16/20); F (FGF11-14); and G (FGF15/19/21/23). Based only on high bootstrap values (above 700), it was not possible to firmly include in any of these families the following: human FGF3 and FGF5; C. intestinalis FGF3/7/10/22, FGF4/5/6, FGF8/17/18, FGF9/16/20, and FGF with a large molecular mass; D. melanogaster FGFs; and C. elegans LET-756 and EGL-17. The grouping of the non-vertebrate sequences remained non-conclusive, and we could not establish relationships of direct orthology between human, fly, and worm FGFs. During evolution, the formation of the FGF families may have occurred before and/or after the separation of protostomians from deuterostomians. If they formed before this separation, a non-vertebrate FGF should belong to a given family and be the respective ortholog of its mammalian members. If they formed after this separation, non-vertebrate FGFs should be orthologous to all of the deuterostomian FGFs. Documenting this difference may help to understand the FGF features and functions and the reason for FGF gene expansion. To address this question, we studied the LET-756 molecule. We previously characterized the let-756 locus (7Roubin R. Naert K. Popovici C. Vatcher G. Coulier F. Thierry-Mieg J. Pontarotti P. Birnbaum D. Baillie D. Thierry-Mieg D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6741-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In a severely affected strain (s2887), a loss-of-function let-756 allele causes developmental arrest early in the larval stages. In a partial loss-of-function allele (s2613), a mutation introduces a stop codon at the Arg-318 position leading to a truncated protein that allows a few worms to develop up to the adult stage (see Fig. 1B). LET-756 shares features with FGFs of different families, such as expression in cytoplasm and nucleus of muscles and neurons (Fig. 3), because of the presence of numerous nuclear localization signals (NLS) and the absence of a classical leader but the presence of a central hydrophobic sequence (see Figs. 1B and 4A). Interestingly, it is not produced by hypodermal cells where it interacts with its receptor EGL-15 to regulate fluid balance (20Huang P. Stern M.J. Development. 2004; 131: 2595-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and axonal outgrowth (21Bulow H.E. Boulin T. Hobert O. Neuron. 2004; 42: 367-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), indicating that it is secreted in vivo despite the absence of a classical leader sequence. Thus, based on phylogeny as well as on other features, it was impossible to associate LET-756 with any family.Fig. 4Structural features of FGFs.A, alignment of core region sequences from FGFs used for chimeric constructs (hN and hC for N- and C-terminal α-helixes, respectively, and b1-b12 for the 12 β-sheets in the core regions.

Naert K. Popovici C. Vatcher G. Coulier F. Thierry-Mieg J. Pontarotti P. Birnbaum D. Baillie D. Thierry-Mieg D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6741-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This activity is conserved when LET-756 is tagged with GFP in the C-terminal region. In contrast, a construct deleted of the core region of LET-756 could not rescue the let-756(s2887) mutants (Table I). To determine whether LET-756 is functionally closer to any of the FGF families, we replaced the LET-756 core sequence with that of other FGFs including one from each human family (FGF2, FGF3, FGF6, FGF7, FGF8, FGF9, FGF12, and FGF21) and with that of Drosophila BNL and C. elegans EGL-17. The sequence alignments are shown in Fig. 4A. Only the core of FGF9 replaced efficiently the LET-756 core for rescuing ability (Table I).Table IRescue ability and secretion of LET-756 mutants and chimerasRescueSecretionLET-756++LET-756Δcore−−LET-756ΔFISIA−−LET-756FIST−−LET-756AAA/EEE/KKK−−LET-756R318+/−+LET-756ΔNLS4-6++LET-756[FGF9/16/20]LET-756++LET-756[FGF9ΔFISIA]LET-756NT—LET-756[FGF9]FGF9−+FGF9[FGF9]LET-756++LET-756[FGF3/6-8/12/21]LET-756−−LET-756[FGF-E]LET-756−−LET-756[FGF-EEFISIA]LET-756++LET-756[FGF2]LET-756−−LET-756[FGF2EFISIA]LET-756−−FGF9−+ Open table in a new tab Family E Groups FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20—Similar to the FGF9 core, the cores of FGF16 and FGF20, introduced in the LET-756 background, rescued the let-756 phenotype (s2887). Because FGF-E from C. intestinalis is supposed to be orthologous to FGF9 (8Satou Y. Imai K.S. Satoh N. Dev. Genes Evol. 2002; 212: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we also tested the Plet-756::let-756[Fgf-E]let-756::gfp chimera. This chimera was unable to rescue the lethal let-756 phenotype as did two other chimeras containing cores of Ciona FGF-D and FGF-F. In control experiments, wild-type worms were transformed with FGF9, FGF12, and FGF16 chimeras (Fig. 3, b-d). GFP expression was detected in neurons and muscle cells, indicating that the lack of rescuing activity was not linked to a defect in protein expression. Residues in the Core Region Are Necessary but Not Sufficient for Rescuing Activity—These results suggest that LET-756 could resemble FGF family E members FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20. We looked for what LET-756 and this family have in common and do not share with the other families. An examination of the alignment of the various FGFs pointed to the presence of a highly conserved motif (shaded in Fig. 4A) located in the core region. It was only present in LET-756 (EFVSVA: amino acids 116-120), FGF9, (EFISIA), FGF16 (EFISLA), and FGF20 (EFISVA). This sequence is slightly different in Ciona FGF-E, because only four of six conserved amino acids are present (EFISTG). The EFISIA/EFVSVA sequence is a hydrophobic stretch within the LET-756 and FGF9 molecules (Fig. 4B). To test for the importance of this motif on the function of LET-756, we made a construct where let-756 under the control of its own promoter was deleted in the sequence encoding these six residues (Plet-756::let-756ΔEFVSVA::gfp construct) and tested the rescuing activity in let-756(s2887) animals. The construct deleted of the sequence was devoid of rescuing activity (Table I). No other mutation in the core impaired the rescue of the lethal phenotype. As an example, LET-756 deleted from the NLS4-6 region was still able to rescue. When the region coding for the EFISIA motif was deleted from the core region of the LET-756/FGF9 chimera (Plet-756::let-756[FGF9ΔEFISIA]let-756::gfp construct), the rescue was abolished. To confirm the importance of this region in the function of LET-756, we exchanged the corresponding regions in LET-756 and Ciona FGF-E. When the EFISIA stretch replaced EFISTG in the FGF-E chimera (Plet-756::let-756[Fgf-EEFISIA]let-756::gfp construct), the rescuing activity was restored. Conversely, the replacement of EFVSVA by EFISTG in LET-756 (Plet-756::let-756EFIST::gfp) abolished the rescuing activity. However, the role of the EFISIA motif worked only in the context of the FGF-E family. Appending an EFISIA motif to the LET-756/FGF2 chimera (Plet-756::let-756[FGF2EFISIA]let-756::gfp construct) did not confer rescuing activity (Table I). Thus, an EFISIA motif was necessary for the FGFs of the E family but was not sufficient for the other FGFs. The EFISIA Motif Is Essential for Secretion—To understand how this motif influences the rescue activity, we tested its role in secretion. COS-1 cells were transfected with constructs including or not including the EFISIA motif. The PCMV::let-756::gfp construct expressed GFP in the nucleus as speckles. A faint staining of the Golgi apparatus was also observed (Fig. 5a), which colocalized with the Golgi marker giantin (Fig. 5d). The fusion protein corresponding to the partial loss-of-function allele (R318Stop) was found in the nucleoli as well as in the Golgi (Fig. 5, c and f). The protein deleted of the EFISIA motif exhibited the same speckle staining as the wild-type molecule but no staining of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5, b and e). FGF9 was mostly found in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5g), in agreement with previous findings (22Revest J.M. DeMoerlooze L. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By contrast, the various mammalian FGF chimeras, including the FGF9 chimera, were localized at speckles in the nucleus (Fig. 5, h, k, and l). Replacing the C-terminal region of LET-756 by that of FGF9 abolished this localization (Fig. 5i), whereas replacing the N-terminal region of LET-756 by that of FGF9 was without effect on the chimera localization (Fig. 5j), pointing out the crucial role of the C-terminal region of LET-756 for nuclear sublocalization. Immunoblots were done with supernatants and cell lysates from transfected cells. LET-756 was efficiently secreted (Fig. 6A). This secretion was dependent on the Golgi-associated system, because it was inhibited by the addition of brefeldin A (Fig. 6A). The majority of the released protein was glycosylated as shown by the addition of tunicamycin. As N-linked glycosylation only occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, this is evidence for export of LET-756 through the secretory pathway. Several other GFP fusion molecules of smaller molecular mass were also detected, which probably resulted from endogenous proteolysis. In contrast, the absence of the EFVSVA motif impaired secretion (LET-756ΔEFVSVA). This was not the case for the absence of other regions (LET-756ΔNLS4-6, LETR318) (Fig. 6B). The core of FGF-E with its unconserved EFISTG motif was not secreted. In contrast, changing EFISTG in EFISIA restored secretion (Fig. 6D) as it had restored rescuing activity (Table I). The protein encoded by the FGF2 chimera, appended or not with the EFISIA motif, which as seen above did not have rescuing activity (Table I), was not secreted (Fig. 6D, lanes 12 versus 11). Thus, the EFISIA motif is necessary but not sufficient by itself for either secretion or rescuing capacity. Because the hydrophobicity of the EFISIA motif has been involved in its capability to allow secretion of FGF9 and FGF16 (22Revest J.M. DeMoerlooze L. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Miyakawa K. Hatsuzawa K. Kurokawa T. Asada M. Kuroiwa T. Imamura T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35718-35724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we introduced various point mutations in the LET-756 EFVSVA motif to change its hydrophobicity (Fig. 4B). Neither change of those amino acids in Lys or Gly, which makes molecules less hydrophobic, nor in Ala, which increases hydrophobicity, allowed the resulting molecules to be secreted (Fig. 6C, lane 6) indicating that hydrophobicity alone is not a key determinant of LET-756 activity. The conformation of the molecule, which is possibly induced by the primary sequence of this region, might be important for secretion. Role of Sequences Outside the Core—Finally, we tested whether FGF9 per se could confer rescue. We made a construct (Plet-756::FGF9::gfp) where the expression of FGF9 was directed by the let-756 promoter and tested for the rescue of the let-756(s2887) animals. FGF9 by itself was unable to rescue the lethal phenotype. This indicates that at least another region of the LET-756 molecule is necessary to ensure the full biological function of this C. elegans FGF, in agreement with the truncation of the LET-756 C-terminal region (LETR318) that induces a partial loss-of-function. The construct (Plet-756::FGF9[FGF9]let-756::gfp), in which the 3′ region of let-756 is present, rescued the null mutant in contrast to the Plet-756::let-756[FGF9]FGF9::gfp construct in which the 3′ end is that of FGF9. Both constructs encoded proteins capable of being secreted when transfected into COS-1 cells (Fig. 6D). This shows again the importance of the EFISIA motif for secretion but not for full biological activity. As expected, the secretion of the FGF9 chimera deleted from the EFISIA motif was impaired (Fig. 6C, lane 8) and unable to exert rescue ability when injected in the null mutant. Thus, LET-756 has both similarity to FGF-E family members and specific features associated with its C-terminal region. From a functional point of view, it is hard to draw parallels among FGF activities in different species. For example, LET-756 shares nuclear localization with FGF1, FGF2, FGF3, and FHFs (for review see Ref. 24Miyakawa K. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35718-35724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and muscle expression with FGF5, FGF6, and FGF9 (24Miyakawa K. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35718-35724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Goldfarb M. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/106/pe37)PubMed Google Scholar, 26deLapeyrière O. Ollendorff V. Planche J. Ott M.O. Pizette S. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Development. 1993; 118: 601-611PubMed Google Scholar). From an evolutionary point of view, two striking features are associated with the FGF superfamily. First, there has been an important expansion of the number of FGF genes in vertebrates. Second, there is no clear orthology relationship between mammalian and non-vertebrate FGFs. This expansion could be explained by the series of duplications that have accompanied vertebrate evolution, but the absence of direct orthology makes difficult to reconstitute the different steps. This prompted us to study the interchangeability of FGFs from various species with LET-756 as a “functional phylogenic” approach. We have shown that LET-756 is related to FGF family E. This has two broad implications: 1) biology and 2) evolution. Biology—Among the chimeric constructs tested, only those containing the core of FGF9, FGF16, or FGF20, which belong to the same FGF family (FGF-E family), were capable of a functional substitution. Most FGFs, such as FGF3, FGF6, FGF8, FGF10, FGF17, FGF18, and FGF22, contain a signal sequence for cell export. However, FGF3 is not secreted and is retained in the Golgi complex. FGF1 and FGF2, which do not contain such sequence, are released from cells by a mechanism independent of the ER/Golgi secretory pathway. FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20 do not have a classical signal sequence. They are efficiently secreted in an ER/Golgi-dependent pathway because of the presence of a high hydrophobic N-terminal region and a six amino acid-long region located within the core (22Revest J.M. DeMoerlooze L. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Miyakawa K. Hatsuzawa K. Kurokawa T. Asada M. Kuroiwa T. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29352-29357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Miyakawa K. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35718-35724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have shown here that LET-756, which like FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20 does not have a typical N-terminal signal sequence, is efficiently secreted by a Golgi-associated mechanism dependent on the presence of the same six core residues as for the FGF-E family that are also essential for rescue activity. Only core sequences from members of the FGF-E family that have this sequence are able to rescue the worm null mutant. However, inserting this motif in the cores of FGFs from other families is not sufficient to confer rescuing ability. C. intestinalis FGF9/16/20 (designated FGF-E in this paper) is supposed to be orthologous to mammalian FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20 (8Satou Y. Imai K.S. Satoh N. Dev. Genes Evol. 2002; 212: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It contains an incomplete EFISIA motif that does not allow secretion and rescue in the LET-756 background. Replacement of EFISTG by EFISIA is sufficient to confer both rescuing activity and secretion to the protein. Here we have shown that the atypical mechanism of secretion of LET-756 and FGF-E members that utilizes that internal hydrophobic motif is conserved in different species. Such atypical signal peptides have been found in some other proteins in vertebrates but remain rare (for review see Refs. 22Revest J.M. DeMoerlooze L. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Miyakawa K. Hatsuzawa K. Kurokawa T. Asada M. Kuroiwa T. Imamura T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35718-35724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is the first time that such a mechanism is demonstrated in the nematode. In present-day Ciona FGF-E EFISTG, it is not efficient for export, which uses a classical peptide signal. For FGF9, in addition to the EFISIA motif, the N-terminal portion of the molecule is also important for secretion, whereas it is not the case for LET-756. It is possible that the routing of the proteins associated with this mode of export is different from those using a classical peptide sequence. In this case, interacting proteins could be specific of this pathway but they remain unidentified. Work is in progress to determine whether secretion of LET-756 and subsequent interaction with its membrane FGF receptor, EGL-15 5B (28Goodman S.J. Branda C.S. Robinson M.K. Burdine R.D. Stern M.J. Development. 2003; 130: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), is the only activating process or whether the nuclear pool of LET-756 exerts any other biological activity. There may have been a limited conservation of function within the FGF superfamily during evolution. The three mammalian FGFs of the E family and Ciona FGF-E share a common function in the nervous system (9Bertrand V. Hudson C. Caillol D. Popovici C. Lemaire P. Cell. 2003; 115: 615-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 27Colvin J.S. Feldman B. Nadeau J.H. Goldfarb M. Ornitz D.M. Dev.

Commun. 2000; 277: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). FGF9 directs embryogenesis of several organs, including the reproductive and excretory system (31Colvin J.S. Green R.P. Schmahl J. Capei B. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 2001; 104: 875-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). LET-756 is expressed in the CAN cells, which regulates excretion in the worm. It acts upon EGL-15 in the hypodermis to regulate the balance of fluids (20Huang P. Stern M.J. Development. 2004; 131: 2595-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, a control of the excretory system might be a primordial function of this family. Beside this function, a role for LET-756 in axonal outgrowth has also been reported recently (21Bulow H.E. Boulin T. Hobert O. Neuron. 2004; 42: 367-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). LET-756 expressed in muscle cells allows outgrowth of the axons on the surface made by EGL-15B expressing hypodermal cells. In conclusion, the physiology of LET-756 and FGF-E members may be compared directly within this family, both in terms of trafficking and of cellular targets. Evolution—The structural and functional features shared by LET-756 and FGFs from family E may be due to a common ancestry or to the convergent acquisition of a secretory capacity. As previously suggested from sequence alignments, (6Burdine R.D. Chen E.B. Kwok S.F. Stern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2433-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) the other C. elegans FGF, EGL-17, might belong to FGF family D, although we did not find again the real phylogenic relationship because the bootstrap value was not significant. The common ancestry of each of the two C. elegans FGF with a given family would signify that a first expansion of the FGF genes has taken place early before the protostomian/deuterostomian split, but gene losses have been important in the protostomian branch, and that only two FGF families, E and D, are represented in the present-day nematode. However, LET-756, in addition to a core region that is functionally close to the FGFs of family E, has evolved to acquire a unique C-terminal region and new functions that come with it. We thank F. Birg and D. Maraninchi for encouragements, and J. P. Borg, F. Coulier, and P. Pontarotti for discussions. For the gift of FGF cDNAs, we are very grateful to C.

The goal of this study was to define one such difference and elucidate the signaling mechanism responsible for such differential gene induction by these agonists. We observed that expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase is substantially induced by flagellin but only minimally expressed in response to TNFα. This difference seemed to be underlain by differential induction of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) activation in that, whereas flagellin and TNFα seemed to be equipotent activators of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-κB, flagellin induced substantially higher levels of STAT-1 and -3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Such flagellin-induced STAT activation exhibited delayed kinetics and was ablated by treatment with cycloheximide. Flagellin-induced activation of STAT-3 was abolished via neutralizing antibodies to interleukin (IL)-6, but not interferon (IFN)β nor IFNγ; none of these neutralizing antibodies had any effect on flagellin-induced STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Flagellin induced substantially more IL-6 expression than did TNFα, but neither agonist elicited detectable levels of IFN expression. Flagellin-induced expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase but not IL-6, was abolished by blocking STAT activation with AG490, and was reduced by blocking STAT-3 activation with anti-IL-6. Together, these results indicate that epithelial cell induction of flagellin-specific gene expression is mediated, in part, by STAT activation that results from autocrine activation via IL-6.

The epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal tract are the front line of defense against the diverse population of commensal and potentially pathogenic microbes that thrive within the lumen of the human intestine. In accordance with this role, in response to pathogens such as the gastroenteritis-causing pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, the intestinal epithelium activates the transcription of a panel of several hundred genes whose overall function is to promote and regulate host defense (1Zeng H. Carlson A.Q. Guo Y. Yu Y. Collier-Hyams L.S. Madara J.L. Gewirtz A.T. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3668-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The necessary and sufficient molecular trigger of this switch in epithelial gene program is the ligation of basolateral toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Jak, Janus kinase.1The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Jak, Janus kinase. by flagellin monomers, the subunits of bacterial flagella (2Gewirtz A.T.

Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). Such flagellin-induced changes in epithelial gene expression probably play a key role in promoting the immune inflammatory response that is the histopathologic hallmark of human salmonellosis and serves to clear this infection from the intestinal mucosa while avoiding widespread systemic dissemination in human hosts (5Gewirtz A.T. Liu Y. Sitaraman S.V. Madara J.L. Best. Pract. Res. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2002; 16: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).The general pattern of gene expression induced by flagellin bears substantial similarity to that induced by the endogenous pro-inflammatory stimulus TNFα; nonetheless, there seem to be significant differences in these patterns, particularly with respect to some genes with important immune function; for example, as shown herein, induction of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) was much greater in response to flagellin than to TNFα. The goal of this study was to ascertain the differences in signaling mechanisms that underlie these differences in gene expression. Because we have shown previously that flagellin and TNFα seem to be similar in their abilities to activate 2 central pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, namely nuclear factor-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (3Gewirtz A.T.

Physiol. 2003; 285: G282-G290Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we particularly focused on the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of proteins, because STATs are known to play a role in regulation of iNOS, and the differential STAT activation induced by TLR2 and TLR4 ligands underlies the differential gene expression induced by these ligands in macrophages (7Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). We report that, indeed, the differential STAT activation seems to underlie some of the differences between the specific patterns of gene expression induced by flagellin and TNFα.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies were purchased from the following sources; phosphorylated p38, IκBα, and STATs were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), except for anti-phospho-serine STAT-1, which was from Upstate Biotechnology. iNOS antibiody was from R&D Systems, Inc. β-actin antibody was from Sigma. Neutralizing antibody to IFNβ and IFNγ were from Biotrend (Cologne, Germany) and R&D Systems, respectively. Recombinant cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, IFNγ, and IFNβ) and neutralizing antibodies INFγ and the IL-6 receptor were from R&D Systems, Inc. Flagellin was purified from S. typhimurium-conditioned media by anion/cation exchange chromatography and purity verified as described previously (2Gewirtz A.T. Simon Jr., P.O. Schmitt C.K.

In brief, such flagellin does not activate any TLR other than TLR5 (3Gewirtz A.T. Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1882-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) and has less than 0.5 pg of LPS/μg of flagellin (8McSorley S.J. Ehst B.D. Yu Y. Gewirtz A.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3914-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical. Generation of aflagellate S. typhimurium (FliC/FljB) was described previously (9Schmitt C.K. Darnell S.C. O'Brien A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2911-2915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Culture/Stimulations—Intestinal epithelial T84 cells were cultured on standard tissue culture plates or, where indicated, collagen-coated permeable supports as described previously (10Gewirtz A.T. Reed K.A. Merlin D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. Methods Microbiol. 2002; 31: 377-396Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These cells consistently grow to very high and uniform confluence, which allows generation of lysates with very uniform protein concentration, which is nonetheless verified via β-actin immunoblots (see below). TNFα and flagellin were used at 20 and 100 ng/ml, respectively, based on our previous extensive studies that have in general defined these concentrations as being about two times saturating, although precise saturating concentrations can vary with cell passage (1Zeng H.

Investig. 1998; 101: 1860-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).iNOS mRNA Measurement—iNOS mRNA level was determined by hybridization-based Quantikine mRNA assay kit (R&D Systems). Cells were treated as indicated, total RNA was isolated, and 5 μg per sample was used to quantitate iNOS mRNA following the manufacturer's protocol.SDS-PAGE Immunoblotting—T84 cells were stimulated as described in figure legends, rinsed in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2P2O7, and 2 mm NaVO4, plus proteinase inhibitors) at a concentration of 107 cells/ml cleared by centrifugation (10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C), and subjected to SDS-PAGE at 50 μg of protein/lane. Membranes were blotted to specific antibodies. Equal protein loading was verified by stripping each blot and reblotting with anti-β-actin to probe levels of β-actin, a protein whose expression does not change in response to short-term (i.e. hours) pro-inflammatory stimuli (1Zeng H. Carlson A.Q. Guo Y. Yu Y. Collier-Hyams L.S. Madara J.L. Gewirtz A.T. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3668-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Each Western blot shown was representative of more than three similar experiments. Quantitation was performed via a Bio-Rad GS-700 Imaging densitometer following the manufacturer's instructions. The instrument was set in linear mode and calibrated using the manufacturer's Calibration TARGET kit combined with recommended Quantity One software. Furthermore, effective linearity was verified by analysis of sequential dilutions of the samples that provided the strongest signal for each set of experiments. One example of such a series of dilutions is shown in Fig. 1D. When the relative concentration was plotted versus the quantitative densitometric value in this manner, r2 values always exceeded 0.90.Cell Fractionations—After indicated treatment, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, centrifuged, and resuspended in cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors). Cytosol and nuclei were separated by brief centrifugation (5 min at 500 × g). The nuclear pellet was resuspended and lysed in ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA plus protease inhibitors). Clear nuclear extract was collected after centrifugation (10 min at 15,000 × g).Cytokine Neutralization and Jak2 Inhibition—T84 cells were incubated in serum-free media containing neutralizing antibodies for 1 h before stimulation. The concentrations used were based on manufacturer's recommendations and our tests of efficacy using recombinant cytokines. In particular, we observed that more than 90% of cytokine activity was blocked at 1:1000 dilutions of these antibodies (see “Results” for discussion of negative controls). After 1 h of incubation, T84 cells were treated with flagellin for 2 h or cytokines for 15 min. Cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting. For Jak2 inhibitor AG490 experiment, T84 cells in serum-free medium were pretreated with 10 μm AG490 and were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml flagellin for 2 h (for STAT tyrosine phosphorylation detection) or 5 h (for iNOS detection).IL-6 Assessment—IL-6 was measured via by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from R&D Systems, as described previously (12Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Wang L. Wong M. Gewirtz A.T. Si-Tahar M. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).RESULTSFlagellin Induces iNOS Expression—Our recent studies of epithelial gene expression using mRNA microarray expression profiling revealed that, in general, there is substantial similarity in the pattern of gene expression induced by the bacterial product flagellin and the endogenous pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα (1Zeng H. Carlson A.Q. Guo Y. Yu Y. Collier-Hyams L.S. Madara J.L. Gewirtz A.T. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3668-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we also observed some differences in the gene expression induced by these agonists; for example, compared with TNFα, expression of iNOS was enhanced in response to flagellin. We first sought to verify this difference in iNOS mRNA levels by an alternate technique and to investigate whether the difference would be manifested at the protein level. Quantitation of iNOS mRNA was performed with a well standardized, commercially available hybridization-based assay kit using 2× previously defined saturating concentrations of these agonists (2Gewirtz A.T. Simon Jr., P.O. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H. O'Brien A.D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 6Yu Y. Zeng H. Lyons S. Carlson A. Merlin D. Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G282-G290Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In agreement with our microarray studies, flagellin induced a significantly greater increase in iNOS mRNA than did TNFα (Fig. 1A) in T84 epithelial cells. This difference was observed at all the time points at which an increase in iNOS mRNA was observed. We next examined whether the levels of iNOS protein correlated with the changes we had observed in iNOS mRNA levels. As illustrated in Fig. 1, B and C, the same pattern of expression was observed in that flagellin induced substantially more iNOS protein than TNFα. Such iNOS induction required 4 h and persisted for several additional hours (Fig. 1B). Induced expression of iNOS was observed throughout flagellin's previously defined range of bioactive concentrations and was only slightly induced by TNFα throughout its bioactive concentration range (Fig. 1C). Although use of chemiluminescent reagents to develop film tends to be a semiquantitative readout rather than the truly quantitative readout provided by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we attempted to aid this semiquantitation by analyzing various dilutions of the flagellin-induced lysate (from the 6-h time point of maximal concentration). This approach indicated that the flagellin-induced lysate contained about 4–8 times as much iNOS as the extract of cells stimulated with TNFα (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, we used this dilutional approach, combined with densitometric analysis of the film, to verify that all our SDS-PAGE immunoblots were developed within the working linear range of the film. Last, performing direct quantitation of three experiments via such linearized densitometric analysis indicated that, at 4 h, flagellin induced 6.6 ± 1.8-fold greater expression of iNOS than did TNFα. Such enhanced iNOS induction by flagellin, compared with TNFα, did not reflect the responsiveness of the cells to these agonists in general because, for example, these agonists induce generally similar expression profiles by microarray (1Zeng H. Carlson A.Q. Guo Y. Yu Y. Collier-Hyams L.S. Madara J.L. Gewirtz A.T. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3668-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and seemed quite similar in their abilities to activate pro-inflammatory signaling events such as activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-κB, as assessed by phosphorylation of IκBα and p38, respectively (Fig. 1, E and F) (3Gewirtz A.T.

Physiol. 2003; 285: G282-G290Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As a result, the classic proinflammatory gene IL-8 is induced similarly well by TNFα and flagellin (Fig. 1G) (2Gewirtz A.T. Simon Jr., P.O. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H. O'Brien A.D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), consistent with many studies showing that IL-8 expression is regulated by these pro-inflammatory signals.STAT Phosphorylation Was Differentially Induced by Flagellin and TNFα—To investigate the signaling mechanisms that might underlie epithelial activation of flagellin-enhanced gene expression, we examined activation of the STAT pathway, because differential activation of STAT-1 underlies TLR4-specific gene expression in macrophages (7Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). STAT activation was assessed by measuring its phosphorylation status and subcellular localization. First, we examined serine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3, because such serine phosphorylation is thought to be important in generating maximal STAT transcriptional activity. TNFα and flagellin induced similar levels of serine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3 as assessed by visual examination of films from several experiments. In particular, although neither agonist seemed to induce dramatic changes in serine phosphorylation of either STAT, both agonists consistently induced modest changes in STAT serine phosphorylation that were detectable at the earliest assayed time point (30 min) and maintained for 2–6 h (Fig. 2A). Quantitation via densitometry indicated that, at 1 h after stimulation, inductions in STAT serine averaged, for flagellin and TNFα, respectively, 1.5 ± 0.4-fold and 1.6 ± 0.3-fold for STAT-1 and 1.4 ± 0.3-fold and 1.4 ± 0.2-fold for STAT-3, consistent with our visual assessment that we did not observe consistent differences in the patterns of STAT serine phosphorylation induced by these agonists. Next, we measured STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, because STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is generally accepted to be the rate-limiting event in the promotion of STAT-mediated transcription. In contrast to their similar induction of STAT serine phosphorylation, visual assessment of films of developed SDS-PAGE immunoblots indicated that flagellin consistently induced substantially higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 1 and 3 than did TNFα (Fig. 2A). For both of these stimuli, tyrosine phosphorylation exhibited a relatively delayed time course requiring a minimum of 2 h to observe an increase relative to untreated epithelial cells. Consistent with our visual assessment, quantitation via densitometry indicated that, at 2 h, inductions in STAT tyrosine phosphorylation averaged, for flagellin and TNFα, respectively, 5.7 ± 1.2-fold and 2.5 ± 0.4-fold for STAT1 and 10.9 ± 4.5-fold and 2.5 ± 1.6-fold for STAT-3. Total levels of these STATs did not change throughout the time course assayed. We also examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 5 and 6 in response to flagellin and TNFα but did not observe any changes in response to either agonist (data not shown).Fig. 2Flagellin induces more STAT tyrosine phosphorylation than TNFα. Epithelial cells were stimulated with flagellin or TNFα for the indicated times. A, cells were lysed and assayed for STAT phosphorylation by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting. PY, phosphotyrosine; PS, phosphoserine. B and C, cells were disrupted, fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and total STAT (B) and phosphotyrosine STAT (C) were measured in fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates STAT dimerization and, subsequently, nuclear translocation (13Calo V. Migliavacca M. Bazan V. Macaluso M. Buscemi M. Gebbia N. Russo A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Thus, we next assessed STAT nuclear translocation by measuring levels of STATs that were in the cytosolic or nuclear fraction of disrupted epithelial cells (Fig. 2B). In parallel with its greater potency at inducing STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, flagellin induced substantially more nuclear translocation of STAT-3 than did TNFα (average induction by densitometry was 3.2-fold greater for flagellin than TNFα); a similar pattern of activation of STAT-1, albeit less robust, was observed (data not shown). Thus, as shown in Fig. 2C, flagellin treatment resulted in more nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-1 and -3 than did treatment by TNFα. For either stimulus (or STAT), we consistently observed a 0.5–1-h delay between STAT tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Thus, flagellin is more potent than TNFα at activating STATs 1 and 3, consistent with the possibility that differential STAT activation may underlie flagellin-enhanced gene expression.Flagellin-induced STAT-3 Activation Is Mediated by IL-6 — The 2-h delay in appearance of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation in response to flagellin (and TNFα) suggested that newly synthesized proteins mediate this signaling event. In support of this notion, we observed that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide abolished STAT tyrosine phosphorylation in response to flagellin (Fig. 3A). To rule out the possibility that cycloheximide was blocking STAT phosphorylation by nonspecific means, we verified that cycloheximide had no effect on total STAT levels or on STAT tyrosine phosphorylation induced by either IL-6 or IFNβ (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Thus, flagellin-induced STAT tyrosine phosphorylation requires new protein synthesis.Fig. 3Flagellin-induced IL-6 expression mediates STAT-3 activation.A, T84 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), flagellin (100 ng/ml), or both for 2 h, at which time STAT tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting. B, cells were treated with IL-6 (50 ng/ml), IFNβ (103 units/ml), or IFNγ (105 units/ml) in the absence or presence of indicated dilution of neutralizing antibodies to those cytokines. STAT activation was assayed as indicated. C, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml flagellin in the absence or presence of cytokine-neutralizing antibodies applied at 1:1000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next considered some of the candidate molecules that might mediate STAT activation in response to flagellin. Because IL-6 was known to be secreted by epithelia (14Wang L.H. Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A. Yu C.R. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3897-3904PubMed Google Scholar) and given its potent ability to activate STATs in epithelia, IL-6 seemed a likely candidate to be the paracrine or autocrine mediator responsible for flagellin-induced STAT activation. Interferons, especially IFNβ, also seemed like reasonable candidate mediators in light of their ability to activate STATs in general and the role of IFNβ in LPS-induced macrophage activation in particular (7Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was investigated via the use of cytokine-neutralizing antibodies, the efficacy and specificity of which we first verified (Fig. 3B), and by measuring expression of these cytokines in response to flagellin. In particular, we used both positive and negative controls to test a series of commercially available cytokine neutralizing antibodies to investigate which cytokines might be paracrine mediators of flagellin-induced STAT activation. We observed that, in our hands, several such purchased “neutralizing” antibodies either did not effectively neutralize their targets or had nonspecific effects on responses induced by other recombinant cytokines. However, as shown in Fig. 3B, three commercially available antibodies were able to effectively neutralize their targets in that antibodies to IFNβ, IFNγ, and IL-6 (receptor) all blocked STAT activation in response to their corresponding cytokines. It is noteworthy that none of these antibodies blocked responses to other cytokines (anti-IFNβ, anti-IFNγ, and anti-IL-6 did not block STAT activation induced by IFNγ or IL-6, IFNβ or IL-6, or IFNβ or IFNγ, respectively (Fig. 3B and data not shown), indicating that these purified antibodies did not have nonspecific effects on STAT activation. Next, we measured whether such neutralizations modulated STAT activation in response to flagellin. As illustrated in Fig. 3C, pretreatment with the IL-6 receptor-neutralizing antibody abolished flagellin-induced STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation but had no effect on STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that IL-6 is required for activation of STAT-3 but not STAT-1 in these cells. Although both IFNβ and IFNγ potently activated STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in epithelial cells and their neutralizing antibodies suppressed that activation, neither neutralizing antibody was able to reduce STAT-1 or -3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to flagellin, suggesting their lack of involvement in this response.In light of the apparent requirement of IL-6 for flagellin-induced STAT-3 activation, we next measured secretion of IL-6 in response to flagellin and TNFα (Fig. 4). We observed that flagellin induced substantially more (∼3-fold) IL-6 secretion than TNFα, consistent with the notion that differential induction of IL-6 may play a role in induction of flagellin-enhanced gene expression. Although the per-cell level of secretion of IL-6 is relatively low (e.g. about 75-fold less than IL-8), IL-6 secretion (unlike IL-8) is polarized to the apical surface. In our polarized model system, apical volumes are kept relatively small to mimic the very small volume of intestinal crypts. Hence, this leads to concentrations of IL-6 greater than 100 pg/ml and to the likely existence of microgradients closer to the cell surface, thus approaching the 500 pg/ml concentrations of recombinant IL-6 that we observed are sufficient to activate STAT-3 (Fig. 4C). Moreover, specific neutralization of IL-6 blocked STAT-3 activation, demonstrating that this level of IL-6 production is important in the context of flagellin stimulation. In contrast, sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits able to detect picogram quantities of cytokines were unable to detect either IFNγ or IFNβ in response to flagellin (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that IL-6 mediates flagellin-induced STAT-3 activation and that preferential induction of IL-6 in response to flagellin, compared with TNFα, partly underlies flagellin-enhanced STAT-3 activation and, subsequently, perhaps, flagellin-enhanced gene expression. In contrast to its role in LPS-stimulated macrophages, neither IFNβ nor IFNγ plays a role in flagellin-induced STAT activation of T84 epithelial cells.Fig. 4Flagellin is a more potent inducer of IL-6 secretion than is TNFα. A, T84 cells were treated with indicated dose of flagellin or TNFα. B, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNFα or 100 ng/ml flagellin. A an"

We have previously identified the importance of amino acid residues in the A-B loop of the Cϵ3 domain of human IgE and implicated a region close to the glycosylation site at asparagine 371 as contributing to IgE-CD23 interaction. These residues were now targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. The IgE-CD23 interaction was assessed by semiquantitative flow cytometry. Replacement of the entire Cϵ3 A-B loop (residues 341–356) with the homologous rat IgE sequence resulted in complete loss of human CD23 recognition, as did replacement of residues 346–353, indicating that class-specific effector residue(s) are contained within these eight amino acids. Lysine 352 within the A-B loop was identified as contributing directly to human CD23 interaction. Mutation to the rodent homologue glycine or glutamate resulted in a significant reduction in binding compared with native IgE, whereas conservative substitution with arginine effected a small, but statistically significant, enhancement of CD23 binding. Mutation of the Cϵ3 glycosylation site at asparagine 371 to threonine or glutamine did not significantly affect CD23 recognition. Our results yield new insights into the structural basis of the hIgE-CD23 interaction and hold promise for the rational design of drugs that can manipulate IgE-mediated regulation of the allergic response.

Antibodies of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) 1The abbreviations used are: IgE, immunoglobulin E; hIgE, human IgE; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: IgE, immunoglobulin E; hIgE, human IgE; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; WT, wild type. isotype have a central role in the initiation and regulation of allergic disorders (1Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. J. Immunol. 1967; 99: 1187-1198PubMed Google Scholar). IgE mediates these functions via the interaction of the Fc region of the molecule with its Fc receptors. The crystal structure of the high affinity receptor (FcϵRI, KA ∼1010m–1) complexed to IgE-Fc has been determined, identifying critical residues involved in the interaction (2Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). FcϵRII/CD23 has been identified as a low affinity receptor for human (h) IgE (KA ∼107m–1) (3Gonzalez-Molina A. Spiegelberg H.L. J. Immunol. 1976; 117: 1838-1845PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, CD23 is not a member of the Ig superfamily but a type II transmembrane receptor expressed on a variety of cells of the immune system (4Delespesse G. Suter U. Mossalayi D. Bettler B. Sarfati M. Hofstetter H. Kilcherr E. Debre P. Dalloul A. Adv. Immunol. 1991; 49: 149-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the absence of a high resolution structure, a composite molecular model has been proposed based on homology of the lectin head with the rat mannose-binding protein (5Padlan E.A. Helm B.A. Biochem.

Immunol. 1997; 27: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The model predicts that five heptadic repeats of hydrophobic Leu/Ile residues form a trimeric α-helical stalk linking the N-terminal extracellular domain to the transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (7Beavil A.J. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Previous studies based on the interaction of hIgE-Fc with a soluble 16-kDa form of the lectin homology domain expressed in NS-O cells identified this region as containing the IgE binding site(s) (8Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More recent studies indicate the necessity of the stalk region for IgE interaction (9Chen B.H. Ma C. Caven T.H. Chan-Li Y. Beavil A. Beavil R. Gould H. Conrad D.H. Immunology. 2002; 107: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using site-specific mutagenesis, the IgE binding region of CD23 has been mapped to two discontinuous segments between residues 165–190 and 224–256 (10Bettler B. Texido G. Raggini S. Ruegg D. Hofstetter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although several other ligands for CD23 have been identified (11Sayers I. Helm B.A. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the role of the receptor and receptor-derived fragments in the regulation of the IgE response has attracted particular interest (12Gould H.J.

Exp. Allergy. 2000; 30: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A greater understanding of the IgE-CD23 interaction, based on the identification of complementary binding regions on each molecule, could assist the development of strategies for the manipulation of the allergic response via this regulatory mechanism. The interaction of IgE with CD23 is species-specific. Human IgE does not bind to the rodent receptor, and rat and mouse IgE will not engage the human homologue, although rat IgE recognizes the mouse receptor (14Bettler B. Hofstetter H. Rao M. Yokoyama W.M. Kilchherr F. Conrad D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7566-7570Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified the hCϵ3 domain as the site of interaction with CD23 (15Vercelli D. Helm B. Marsh P. Padlan E. Geha R.S. Gould H. Nature. 1989; 338: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Nissim A. Schwarzbaum S. Siraganian R. Eshhar Z. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1365-1374PubMed Google Scholar), although monoclonal antibodies that map to epitopes in the Cϵ2 and Cϵ4 domains have been described and are thought to inhibit receptor interaction by steric hindrance (15Vercelli D.

The present investigation aimed to identify class-specific effector residue(s) in the A-B loop influencing the hIgE-CD23 interaction. The A-B loop was targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions involved the introduction of highly conservative changes, e.g. Leu to Ile or Asp to Glu in order to minimize potential structural perturbations caused by the mutagenesis. Residues targeted were also exchanged for rodent homologues in order to investigate the species specificity of the CD23 interaction (19Sayers I. Cain S.A. Swan J.R. Pickett M.A. Watt P.J. Holgate S.T. Padlan E.A. Schuck P. Helm B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16152-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The use of a eukaryotic expression system (20Neuberger M.S. Williams G.T. Mitchell E.B. Jouhal S.S. Flanagan J.G. Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1985; 314: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) facilitated an investigation of the role of hIgE glycosylation. IgE is heavily glycosylated (12–15%), but only N-linked glycosylation has been detected to date. Glycosylation of IgE is not essential for CD23 recognition, in contrast with the interaction of this receptor with CD21 or CD11b/c, which involves carbohydrate residues (21Pochon S. Graber P.

The role of N-linked glycosylation in IgE is still unresolved, although it has been demonstrated that enzymatically deglycosylated IgE (PS) and hIgE-Fc fragments expressed in Escherichia coli engage both Fc receptors, apparently enhancing the affinity of the CD23 interaction by ∼10-fold (15Vercelli D. Helm B. Marsh P. Padlan E. Geha R.S. Gould H. Nature. 1989; 338: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of glycosylation, the solvent-exposed Cϵ3 glycosylation site at Asn-371 was targeted and assessed for a role in the folding, processing, and secretion of IgE variants in mammalian cells. The functional consequences of site-specific mutagenesis were assessed by examining the binding of hIgE mutants to CD23 on the surface of the RPMI-8866 cell line employing a semiquantitative flow cytometry assay. We show that substitution of Cϵ3 A-B loop residues in hIgE with rodent homologues is associated with loss of human CD23 recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis of specific residues within the A-B loop highlighted Lys-352 as an effector determinant residue in the human IgE-CD23 interaction. Gene Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human epsilon (ϵ) gene variants were constructed by overlap extension mutagenesis PCR and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSV-VNP-Hϵ as described (20Neuberger M.S. Williams G.T. Mitchell E.B. Jouhal S.S. Flanagan J.G. Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1985; 314: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The numbering scheme for the hϵ-chain has been maintained as in previous publications (18Helm B.A. Sayers I. Higginbottom A. Machado D.C. Ling Y. Ahmad K. Padlan E.A. Wilson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7494-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). IgE variants were generated by transfection of expression vectors into the J558L cell line. Positive clones were selected, and IgE was purified from cell culture supernatant by affinity purification on NIP-CAP-Sepharose columns (19Sayers I. Cain S.A. Swan J.R. Pickett M.A. Watt P.J.

All pSV-VNPHϵ variants were sequenced (DyeDeoxy sequencing; Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) to ensure the desired mutation had been engineered into the ϵ gene and spurious errors had not been introduced during the PCR reaction. The IgE variants were quantified using the BIAcore biosensor (Amersham Biosciences) as described (19Sayers I. Cain S.A. Swan J.R. Pickett M.A. Watt P.J. Holgate S.T. Padlan E.A. Schuck P.

Assessment of Cell Surface Receptor Interactions—Binding of IgE to cell surface receptors was assessed using flow cytometry. Three cell lines expressing different IgE receptors were used in this investigation: RPMI-8866 cells expressing human CD23 (23Kintner C. Sugden B. Nature. 1981; 294: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with mouse CD23 (Fc1.7 cells; Ref. 24Dierks S.E. Bartlett W.C. Edmeades R.L.

Conrad), and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells transfected with human FcϵRI α-chain (25Wilson A.P. Pullar C.E. Camp A.M. Helm B.A. Eur. J.

For RPMI-8866 cell analysis, cells were washed twice in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% fetal calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide) and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml. 100 μl of cell suspension was added to 20 μl of recombinant IgE (0.125–5 μg). After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of wash buffer and then incubated with 100 μl of biotinylated anti-IgE (Vector Laboratories, Ltd., Peterborough, UK) diluted 1/400 in wash buffer. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, cells were washed and incubated on ice with 100 μl of streptavidin R-phycoerythrin (PE) (1/20 dilution) (Sigma) for 30 min. Before analysis by flow cytometry, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 200 μl of wash buffer. To determine background levels of fluorescence, phosphate-buffered saline or control antibody (mouse IgE SPE7; Sigma) was used in place of the recombinant IgE. Fc1.7 cells or RBL cells transfected with human FcϵRIα cells were first detached from the culture dish using cell dissociation solution. Substitution of anti-IgE with biotinylated anti-λ antibody (Amersham Biosciences) allowed direct comparison between mouse and recombinant human IgE binding using the Fc1.7 cells. Data were collected using a Coulter Etics Elite flow cytometer and analyzed using Datamate (Dako, Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK). Data Analysis—Each assay was carried out using chimeric IgE with wild type (WT) human Fcϵ sequence (Serotec, Kidlington, Oxford, UK) as a reference control. This commercial preparation of recombinant IgE was prepared using the pSV-VNPHϵ expression plasmid and J558L host cell line, identical to that used in the current study. The median log channel number was used for the quantification of WT and variant IgE receptor binding interactions. The mean values from at least three independent experiments were calculated and compared by analysis of variance assay and two sample t tests. Statistical analysis was completed using Minitab (Minitab Inc., State College, PA); a p value <0.05 was considered significant. To facilitate discussion, results were expressed as percentages of WT binding (100%). IgE variants generated, together with the rationale explaining the mutations, are shown in Table I. The positions of Cϵ3 A-B loop residues within the crystal structure of IgE-Fc′ are shown (Fig. 1) The interaction of IgE with cell surface high and low affinity Fc receptors was observed employing a semiquantitative flow cytometry assay. Measurement of fluorescence over a range of IgE concentrations allowed the construction of binding curves (Figs. 2 and 3) and comparison of IgE variants with wild type IgE (Table I). WT IgE binding to RPMI-8866 cells reached saturation at 2.5 μg/assay.Table ISummary of IgE-CD23 interaction datahIgE variantRationale for mutationReceptor interaction compared to WTSignificance (t test, p value)FcϵRICD23FcϵRICD23% ± S.E.Cϵ3 A-B LoopR16Homologous rat residues (amino acids 341-356) grafted into the human Fc region to replace loop A-B.

Binding of the R16 variant was found to be not statistically different from the background level fluorescence (mean value 3% of wild type fluorescence at 2.5 μg of IgE) and significantly reduced compared with wild type binding (p = 0.02, Table I). Throughout this study, FcϵRI interactions were assessed in parallel as an indicator of potential structural perturbations that might have occurred as a consequence of mutagenesis. Changes in FcϵRI interaction observed for this variant (Fig. 2A) were not statistically different from the wild type molecule (88.7%, p = 0.13, Table I). The R16 variant was constructed prior to crystal structure determination of receptor-bound IgE. When the structural coordinates for IgE/FcϵRI became available (2Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), it could not be ruled out that mutation of residues within the β-strands of the immunoglobulin fold (Ser-341, Arg-342, Thr-355, and Ile-356) could induce significant structural perturbations affecting receptor recognition. To address this, a further IgE variant (R8) was generated with the more limited substitution of residues 346–353 of the Cϵ3 A-B loop with the homologous rat residues. The binding characteristics of the R8 variant confirmed earlier results obtained with the R16 chimera: the interaction with CD23 was completely inhibited (97% reduction (versus WT, p = 0.02), identical to background, p = 0.08). The FcϵRI interaction (Fig. 2A) was modestly reduced with a marginal statistical significance for this variant (91%, p = 0.03, Table I). Previous observations suggested Lys-352 within the A-B loop may be a key effector residue, with mutation to Gly, the homologous residue in rodent IgE, resulting in a considerable reduction in receptor interaction (50% decrease (versus WT, p = 0.0007), Table I) (11Sayers I. Helm B.A. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We interpret the effect of this substitution as identifying Lys-352 as a class-specific effector residue contributing directly to the binding of hIgE to CD23, possibly facilitating docking via an electrostatic interaction. The elimination of this interaction appeared to account, at least in part, for the observed loss of CD23 binding associated with the R16 and R8 variants, which contained this substitution. Of all the A-B loop variants generated within this study, the most prominent change in the IgE-CD23 interaction was observed for the K352G substitution. Point mutations involving D347N, D347E, L348I, or R351K had no significant effect on the IgE-CD23 interaction (Table I). Mutation of Pro-345 to Ala resulted in an apparent increase in CD23 binding compared with the wild type molecule, although statistical analysis shows this is of marginal significance (12.5% increase, p = 0.09, Table I). The molecular basis of this observation is currently uncertain but could be because of a potential role of Pro-345 in the restriction of structure and maintenance of the rigid conformation of the A-B loop. An increase in loop flexibility may account for the apparent enhancement of the docking process of hIgE and CD23, at the same time suggesting that the Pro-345 residue is not critical for the overall maintenance of the A-B loop CD23 binding conformation. To substantiate the identification of Lys-352 within the A-B loop as a key effector residue involved in the IgE-CD23 interaction, further point mutations were generated (Fig. 2B). Conservative substitution of Lys-352 with Arg resulted in a small, but statistically significant, increase in the CD23 receptor interaction (14% increase, p = 0.0006). Substitution with the negatively charged Glu residue effected the complete loss of CD23 receptor interaction (98% decrease (versus WT, p = 0.0019), not significantly different to background, p = 0.61, Table I). These results substantiate a role for residue Lys-352 in the interaction of hIgE with CD23 and suggest the possibility of an electrostatic interaction between Lys-352 of IgE and the receptor. Mutation of Lys-352 to Arg or Glu maintained the FcϵRI interaction, and a binding level similar to the wild type molecule was observed (Table I). Variant R16/K352 (Lys-352 of hIgE restored within the R16 variant) was generated to evaluate the contribution of residue 352 to the loss of interaction seen with replacement of the entire A-B loop. This variant showed a limited but significant degree of restoration of CD23 recognition (binding level 39% (versus WT, p = 0.043), significantly different from background, p = 0.025, Table I). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by the finding that this interaction could be inhibited using anti-CD23 monoclonal antibody (MHM6) (data not shown), which is known to inhibit hIgE/CD23 binding. As observed for the R16 variant, the FcϵRI binding levels for the R16/K352 were similar to WT binding, supporting a localized effect of mutagenesis (Table I, Fig. 2). To evaluate whether substitution with homologous rat A-B residues conferred the ability to interact with the rodent receptor, IgE variants were screened by flow cytometry analysis using CHO cells transfected with mouse CD23 (Fc1.7 cells). Neither the R16 chimera or hIgE-Gly-352 variants conferred binding to rodent CD23; however, the R8 variant was found to have an increased interaction with Fc1.7 cells (20% compared with WT mouse IgE; Fig. 3). Although these data indicated that the R8 variant was able to interact with rodent CD23, further analysis showed that this interaction was observed with parental CHO cells (Fig. 3), indicating that this interaction was not specific to CD23. Two additional variants were generated to assess the effect of Asn-371-linked glycosylation on the IgE-CD23 interaction (Fig. 2C). Thr-371 and Gln-371 aglycosylated variants both demonstrated a modest decrease in CD23 binding (84%, p = 0.024, and 88%, p = 0.15, respectively, Table I) indicating that enhanced binding reported for deglycosylated IgE cannot be attributed to a lack of glycosylation at this residue. In the present study, we have confirmed the role of the Cϵ3 A-B loop of human IgE in the IgE-CD23 interaction and identify Lys-352 as an important determinant in CD23 receptor recognition, although the scope of flow cytometry is limited by the fact that it does not yield kinetic data for the interaction studied. These data are in agreement with our previous study (18Helm B.A. Sayers I. Higginbottom A. Machado D.C. Ling Y. Ahmad K. Padlan E.A. Wilson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7494-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the study of Nissim et al., who replaced residues within the N-terminal of the hIgE Cϵ3 domain with the homologous mouse residues (16Nissim A. Schwarzbaum S. Siraganian R. Eshhar Z. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1365-1374PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of residues 330–346 (variant C3BX) maintained the interaction. However, replacement of residues 330–356 (variant C3HD) dramatically reduced activity, suggesting a role for this region in the CD23 interaction (16Nissim A. Schwarzbaum S. Siraganian R. Eshhar Z. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1365-1374PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the substitutions generated within the R16 variant have effected the overall Cϵ3 domain conformation with concomitant loss of CD23 recognition because FcϵRI interaction, which is dependent on residues in hCϵ3, was fully maintained in this study (Table I, Fig. 2) and in a previous study that used surface plasmon resonance to assess the interaction of IgE variants with soluble truncated FcϵRIα (19Sayers I. Cain S.A. Swan J.R. Pickett M.A. Watt P.J. Holgate S.T. Padlan E.A. Schuck P. Helm B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16152-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A significant role for the A-B loop in IgE function has previously been proposed by Wurzburg et al. (26Wurzburg B.A. Garman S.C. Jardetzky T.S. Immunity. 2000; 13: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on crystal structures of IgE-Fc fragments, Wurzburg et al. describe how interactions of A-B loop residues facilitate transition between an open conformation when bound to FcϵRI and a closed conformation when uncomplexed. Wurzburg proposes that this conformational flexibility may allow IgE to form optimal interactions with both FcϵRI and CD23. It could be argued that substitution with homologous rat residues in the R16 and R8 constructs has effectively constricted domain movement and locked the molecule in a non-binding conformation with respect to CD23. However, maintenance of normal FcϵRI interactions would argue in favor of a functionally active molecule. In addition, the absence of noteworthy contacts made by Lys-352 within the available IgE structures and the considerable loss of receptor interaction observed with the Gly-352 variant point to direct involvement in the interaction with CD23. We propose therefore that residues within CD23 bind directly to Lys-352 in hIgE and probably involve electrostatic interaction and concomitant conformational changes to provide optimal docking. The IgE-CD23 interaction has been proposed to have a 2:1 binding stoichiometry, with two lectin heads of the trimeric receptor interacting with the two ϵ-chains of an individual IgE molecule (27Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and dimerization of the hIgE molecule is required (15Vercelli D. Helm B. Marsh P. Padlan E. Geha R.S. Gould H. Nature. 1989; 338: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Dual kinetics have been reported for IgE binding to CD23 (24Dierks S.E. Bartlett W.C. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Rao M. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2372-2382PubMed Google Scholar). The most straightforward explanation for this phenomenon in the context of this model is that one lectin head would initially dock with low affinity, providing the basis for a second interaction of higher affinity. This could involve two sets of distinct interactions, possibly involving different points of contact in the IgE molecule and/or within the receptor. The IgE binding site on CD23 has been mapped to two discontinuous segments between residues 165–190 and 224–256 (10Bettler B. Texido G. Raggini S. Ruegg D. Hofstetter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation demonstrating that mutation of a single residue has a profound effect on receptor recognition suggests that Lys-352 makes a definitive contribution, either by establishing an initial point in the docking with CD23 and/or by contributing to the stability of the interaction. Although these data strongly suggest a dominant role for Lys-352 (e.g. mutation to Glu resulted in an equivalent loss of CD23 binding as observed for the replacement of the entire A-B loop in the R16 and R8 variants), we cannot exclude the contribution of other residues in the A-B loop, including residues at positions 346, 349, and 353 that were not evaluated directly in the current study. Abrogation of the higher affinity interaction using an anti-CD23 stalk region antibody has been shown to result in cells that appear negative for IgE binding as determined by flow cytometry, whereas low affinity binding is still detectable using 125I-labeled IgE (28Kilmon M.A. Ghirlando R. Strub M.P. Beavil R.L. Gould H.J. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3139-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The use of flow cytometry to assess IgE-CD23 interaction does not allow us to conclude whether loss of binding observed with mutants in the present study results from abrogation of one or both of these interactions. The localization of Asn-371 on the same face as Lys-352 and our preliminary data regarding the interaction of mutants inhibiting glycosylation led us to propose a role of glycosylation at Asn-371 in the inhibition of hIgE-CD23 interaction. Our present study shows, however, that Asn-371 glycosylation is not involved in this process. Others have suggested that glycosylation of the Cϵ2 domain accounts for this effect. Deglycosylation of IgE has been shown to expose epitopes on the Cϵ2 domain (29Bjorklund J.E. Karlsson T. Magnusson C.G. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and a role for Asn-265 has been postulated (30Young R.J. Owens R.J. Mackay G.A. Chan C.M. Shi J. Hide M. Francis D.M. Henry A.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to which our results would lend some tentative support. At present, limited structural information is available concerning the interaction of hIgE and CD23. In the absence of high resolution structural data, we identify key regions of the hIgE molecule involved in CD23 recognition that provide new insights into the structural nature of this interaction. The A-B loop in Cϵ3 was identified as a critical region for the interaction, with Lys-352 as a class-specific residue. Acquiring information concerning the structure of complementary binding sites on IgE and its receptors holds potential for the rational design of drugs that could modulate the allergic response."
