Here then, as in the classical theories of elasticity and hydrodynamics, we can treat the materials as continuous media, and the forces and displacements as vectors which vary continuously in space and time."

https://openalex.org/W2009335615,"IN recent years, several studies of the orientation of chitin and protein chains in the insect cuticle1,2 and of cellulose chains in plant cell walls3 have appeared. Between 1938 and 1940, X-ray, optical and chemical studies of the cuticle of annelids and nematodes were made by one of us (L. E. R. P.) with the idea of obtaining information about the structure of other types of natural membranes. The cuticles of these animals are largely composed of fibrils of a protein belonging to the collagen group, distributed with their long axes in the plane of the cuticle and in two preferred orientations with respect to the long axis of the body. In annelids, such as Aphrodite and Lumbricus, the fibrils cross at c. 90°, and each set makes an angle of c. 45° with the long axis. In Ascaris, the two sets make an angle of c. 135° with each other and of c. 70° with the long axis. An arrangement of this kind may be mechanically advantageous, since the resulting membrane is capable of anisometric extension, though the individual fibrils are inextensible."

A CONH group is formed, it is a to a carboxyl group, and the free energy of its formation is of the same order of magnitude. The synthesis was demonstrated in liver and kidney slices of a number of animals; it is inhibited by 0.001 M KCN, which is in accord with the view that the necessary free energy is derived from an oxidation.(1)"
https://openalex.org/W1973918185,"PALUDRINE has recently been introduced into clinical medicine as a drug which is highly active against most species of malaria parasite ; its formula is Tonkin1, in this laboratory, investigated its effect on the exoerythrocytic forms of P. gallinaceum grown in tissue culture, and found that it had no action upon the parasites in the highest concentrations (2–5 mgm. per litre) tolerated by the macrophages. Since this concentration is many times greater than that which is believed to be present in the plasma in human therapy (probably about 0.3 mgm. per litre) its inactivity was surprising ; and the action of paludrine in vitro has been investigated further using P. cynomolgi of monkeys, and the exoerythrocytic forms of P. gallinaceum grown in tissue culture, as test organisms. P. cynomolgi was cultured in vitro at 37° C. by a modification of Bass and John's technique and, 41 hours later, smears were made and stained with Giemsa. The parasites found were classified according to the number of pieces of chromatin present, and the resulting differential counts are shown in the accompanying table. The figures indicate the percentage of parasites containing 1, 2–3, 4–5 pieces of chromatin, etc., respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2081393152,"SILICA gel and cellulose have a wide application as stationary aqueous adsorbents in partition chromatography, the moving phase being an organic solvent. For many purposes a stationary organic phase is desirable, and the use of solvent-treated organic polymers to serve as supporting media for organic solvent phases has, therefore, been investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1994868930,"LARGE areas in and near Somerset are unsuitable for grazing because they cause severe diarrhœa in cattle. These areas, called 'teart', are found on the argillaceous Lower Lias. The disease has been shown1 to be due to an excess of soluble molybdates in the herbage and the soil ; it can be cured by adding copper salts to the diet. A possible explanation of the effect of molybdates is suggested by the following observations."

https://openalex.org/W2005186450,"FOLLOWING the work of Bowden, Gregory and Tabor1, we have made friction-temperature measurements on mono- and multi-layers of calcium stearate and stearic acid on various metals. These authors stated that for each metal the transition from smooth to stick-slip sliding and a rise in the friction occurred at the melting or softening point of a surface film of metal soap produced by reaction with the fatty acid. It seemed, therefore, that in mixed films of soap and acid there should be fluctuations in the friction curve corresponding to the melting points of the substances present."

https://openalex.org/W1972776315,"IN 1914 I had the privilege, thanks to the kindness of the late Prof. Fawcett, of studying the development of the human facial bones in his unique series of embryonic crania. In 1918, as a result of this investigation, I stated in my first publication on the “Ancestry of Man” that absence of the premaxilla on the human face was “a human specific character”, and that from its very precocious ontogenetic development it might be presumed to be a very early phylogenetic acquirement. This statement received a certain amount of adverse criticism, but I repeated it and amplified it again in “Man's Place among the Mammals” in 1929."

A few individuals reproduce in winter, but at a very slow rate. This was a handicap to genetical studies on this species."

https://openalex.org/W1991686088,"THERE is an old belief that the detonation wave in an explosive must travel a certain distance from the initiating point before attaining its final speed. In order to elucidate this problem, cylindrical charges of pressed T.N.T. have been fired with the detonator in different orientations and at various distances from the end surface of the charge. During experiments the flame was photographed on a film running with a constant speed of about 100 m./sec. Between the charge and the camera a screen with a vertical slit, 5 mm. wide, was fitted 1 m. from the charge. In all cases the axis of the charge was horizontal and pointed at the camera."

https://openalex.org/W1965785160,"FOLLOWING the classical work of Dale on acetylcholine, numerous investigators have demonstrated the important part played by this quaternary amine in the nervous system1. A neglected property of acetylcholine is its extraordinary electrogenic action at the phase boundary between oils and aqueous solutions2. This negative phase boundary potential provides a possible explanation of the electrical component of the nerve impulse in cholinergic nerves3. It seems reasonable to suppose that the action potential4 might arise from the contact of acetylcholine with the lipoid layer of the nerve fibre according to the theory of phase-boundary potentials5. Moreover, it has been shown that acetylcholine produces a negative electrical potential on living frog skin6."

https://openalex.org/W1980635441,"EARLIER work on the metabolism of fatty livers by Ennor1 showed that the oxygen consumption and the acetoacetic acid production of liver slices from guinea pigs poisoned with carbon tetrachloride is considerably in excess of normal. Since adenosinetriphosphate is essential for the oxidation of fatty acids2, it was considered of interest to determine a possible correlation between high-energy phosphate content and the increased metabolism of such livers."

https://openalex.org/W2063911058,"THE fission process can be briefly described as follows. A neutron is captured by a nucleus of uranium 235, forming a nucleus of uranium 236 in a highly excited state. This immediately divides into two fragments of roughly equal mass, and at the same time from one to three neutrons are emitted (and also some ?-radiation). The fragments fly apart with considerable speed and, in their passage through matter, their energy of motion is finally transformed into heat. These fragments are, in general, unstable and may pass through a series of transformations, emitting ?-particles and ?-radiations, before they reach a stable configuration."
https://openalex.org/W2384578219,"IN a previous communication1, confirming the occurrence of Mauthner‘s cells in the larvæ of Rana, each axon process was described as dividing into two similar fibres, each of which decussated separately. Subsequent work, while confirming the existence of this condition in other batches of material, has shown that it is not invariable. In many instances the axon process remains undivided, at least in the region of the medulla oblongata."

Much of the later development of these theories was achieved by the .great French school of mathematicians, and the first important steps in the theory of the atmospheric tides were made by Laplace (1774) and later described in his “Mécanique Céleste”. He also was the first to attempt to determine the lunar atmospheric tide from barometric observations ; he realized that tropical data were the most suitable for the purpose, but lacking them, he used 4,752 readings at Brest. His result, as he recognized, did not give the true tidal pressure variation at Brest, which is too small to be separated, in such a short series of data, from the solar daily variations and the much larger irregular changes associated with the weather."

https://openalex.org/W4214812573,"THE term 'Virulence' has sometimes in the past been regarded as an intrinsic property of an infecting agent ; that such a view is not entirely in accord with our knowledge of natural and experimental infections was apparent from the discussion on the nature of virulence at the meeting of the Society for Microbiology held in London on December 20. As virulence can only be measured in terms of the effect on the host by a micro-organism, using that term in its widest sense, it is obvious that the interaction between the micro-organism and host by which we estimate virulence will depend on many variables affecting both participants. Much of the discussion related to these variables and their effect on virulence. A very wide field was covered, contributions on the virulence of bacteria, of fungi and of viruses for both plant and animal hosts and of the parasitic protozoa being made by various speakers. It was generally accepted that multiplication of an infecting agent in the body of the host does not alone determine virulence, and that the term 'Virulence' necessarily implies structural or functional damage to the tissues of the host."
