https://openalex.org/W2049747157,"Cap-dependent binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit during translational initiation requires the association of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G; formerly eIF-4γ and p220) with other initiation factors, notably eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF3. Infection of cells by picornaviruses results in proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G and generation of a cap-independent translational state. Rhinovirus 2A protease and foot-and-mouth-disease virus L protease were used to analyze the association of eIF4G with eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF3. Both proteases bisect eIF4G into N- and C-terminal fragments termed cpN and cpC·. cpN was shown to contain the eIF4E-binding site, as judged by retention on m7GTP-Sepharose, whereas cpC· was bound to eIF3 and eIF4A, based on ultracentrifugal co-sedimentation. Further proteolysis of cpN by L protease produced an 18-kDa polypeptide termed cpN2 which retained eIF4E binding activity and corresponded to amino acid residues 319-479 of rabbit eIF4G. Further proteolysis of cpC· yielded several smaller fragments. cpC2 (∼887-1402) contained the eIF4A binding site, whereas cpC3 (∼480-886) contained the eIF3 binding site. These results suggest that cleavage by picornaviral proteases at residues 479-486 separates eIF4G into two domains, one required for recruiting capped mRNAs and one for attaching mRNA to the ribosome and directing helicase activity. Only the latter would appear to be necessary for internal initiation of picornaviral RNAs.

Translation of eukaryotic cellular mRNA into protein is a complex process involving nearly 200 RNA and protein components interacting in a regulated fashion to ensure timely expression of genetic information(1Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar). Viruses often alter the host cell translational machinery to allow more efficient expression of virally encoded proteins. One of the most dramatic examples of this occurs upon picornaviral infection. The picornaviridae are small, icosohedral, positive-stranded RNA viruses of considerable clinical and veterinary importance, containing such members as poliovirus, rhinovirus, coxsackievirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) 1The abbreviations used are: FMDVfoot-and-mouth disease viruseIFeukaryotic initiation factorHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHRV2human rhinovirus serotype 2MOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Infection of mammalian cells by most members of this family (all genera except cardioviruses and hepatitis A virus) impairs the ability of the host cell to translate capped mRNAs. Translation of the uncapped viral RNA still proceeds, however, by a cap-independent mechanism whereby ribosomes bind internally at specific sites on the viral RNAs(4Pelletier J. Sonenberg N.

The host cell shutoff by rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and aphthoviruses is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by the virally induced cleavage of a protein synthesis initiation factor, eIF4G 2The names of initiation, elongation, and termination factors were revised on April 8, 1995 by an expert panel, Dr. Marianne Grunberg-Manago, Convener, appointed by the IUBMB Nomenclature Committee. The new names are used in the present article. eIF4G was formerly referred to as either p220, eIF-4γ, or eIF-4Fγ. (6Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

The loss of the ability to translate capped host mRNAs correlates with the conversion of eIF4G, detected immunologically, from a cluster of bands migrating on SDS-PAGE at 200-220 kDa to one of 100-130 kDa(6Etchison D.

A. 1982; 79: 3447-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This event is mediated by virally encoded proteases(10Bernstein H.D. Sonenberg N. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

The cleavage products of eIF4G detected in vivo are electrophoretically identical to those generated in vitro using highly purified recombinant forms of the viral proteases(12Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although early evidence suggested that viral proteases played only an indirect role in eIF4G proteolysis(13Lloyd R.E. Toyoda H. Etchison D. Wimmer E. Ehrenfeld E.

However, the observation that eIF4G cleavage is not sufficient for total host cell shutoff in vivo(18Bonneau A.-M. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Perez L. Carrasco L. Virology. 1992; 189: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggests that additional events may play a role in the inhibition of cap-dependent translation. eIF4G functions during initiation of translation through association with other members of the eIF4 group of translation factors (reviewed in (20Hershey J.W.B.

This group includes eIF4A, a 46-kDa bi-directional ATP-dependent helicase; eIF4B, a 70-kDa RNA-binding phosphoprotein which enhances eIF4A activity; eIF4E, a 25-kDa cap-binding phosphoprotein; and eIF4G itself, a 154-kDa phosphoprotein which can be isolated in complexes with eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4E (23Grifo J.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized of these complexes, eIF4F, consists of eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G(23Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These polypeptides collectively recognize the m7GTP-containing cap, unwind mRNA secondary structure, and facilitate binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. The mechanism by which cleavage of eIF4G by picornaviral proteases contributes to an inhibition of cap-dependent translation is not understood, but some functions associated with eIF4F appear to be inactivated. Following poliovirus infection, cross-linking of eIF4 polypeptides to the cap structure is altered(9Lee K.A.W. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3447-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Hansen J.L. Etchison D. Hershey J.W.B. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 200-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lee K.A.W. Edery I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 515-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of cap-binding protein complexes recovered from infected cells is distinctly different from that of uninfected cells, suggesting that infection disrupts macromolecular complexes important for cap-dependent initiation(28Buckley B. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13599-13606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Etchison D. Smith K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7492-7500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since no alteration in other eIF3 or eIF4 polypeptides is apparent as a result of infection (6Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14806-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Duncan R. Etchison D. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

Virology. 1986; 152: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), cleavage of eIF4G is thought to be responsible for the observed changes. This is supported by the fact that protein complexes containing intact eIF4G restore cap-dependent translation in extracts of infected cells(23Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Shatkin A. Rose J. Leong K. Bergman J. Gurdon J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1981; 256: 7691-7694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, extracts of uninfected cells, when treated with purified viral proteases, lose their ability to translate capped mRNA, but addition of eIF4G-containing complexes restores this activity(8Lloyd R.E. Jense H.G. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R.E. Kuechler E. Skern T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7581-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Not only does cleavage of eIF4G result in inactivation of some functions important for cap recognition, but there is also evidence that eIF4G may be important for cap-independent translation of viral RNAs. Addition of the eIF4F complex stimulates in vitro translation from picornaviral internal ribosome entry site sequences (34Anthony D.D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10218-10226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In contrast to cap-dependent initiation, cleavage of eIF4G by picornaviral proteases does not abrogate this stimulation but rather enhances it(16Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R.E. Kuechler E. Skern T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7581-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 37Hambidge S.J. Sarnow P.

Virol. 1994; 68: 5253-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that eIF4G cleavage products play a direct role in cap-independent translation of viral RNAs(16Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R.E. Kuechler E. Skern T.

A. 1992; 89: 10272-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Picornaviral proteases which cleave eIF4G fall into two separate classes. The 2A proteases of rhino- and enteroviruses are small thiol proteases with structural similarities to chymotrypsin and α-lytic protease(39Argos P. Kamer G. Nicklin M.J.H. Wimmer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7251-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 40Gorbalenya A.E. Blinov V.M. Donchenko A.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 194: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The primary cleavage site in rabbit eIF4G is Arg486- Gly487(15Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a secondary site of unknown location has been suggested for the 2A protease of HRV2 (12Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The L protease of FMDV more closely resembles papain in structure (42Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.-C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It initially cleaves eIF4G at Gly479-Arg480 and subsequently at multiple sites as yet unidentified(12Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand better the role of eIF4G in cap-dependent and -independent initiation, we have examined the effect of proteolysis on the association of eIF4G with other initiation factors using recombinant viral proteases. We provide evidence that proteolysis of eIF4G at the primary site separates functional domains. We also report the localization of a second L protease cleavage site in eIF4G which further defines the binding region for eIF4E. These results suggest a model for the role of eIF4G cleavage products in translation of picornaviral RNA. The C4 column for reverse phase separation of eIF4G cleavage products was obtained from Vydak (Hesperia, CA). HPLC-grade acetonitrile was obtained from Fisher. m7GTP-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. m7GTP and antipain were obtained from Sigma. Peptide 9, consisting of the sequence KEFEKDKDDDVVFEC, was synthesized by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Dallas, TX). This sequence corresponds to amino acid residues 653-666 of human eIF4G (43Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that residue 664 was changed from Glu to Val to enhance the yield of peptide synthesis, and the C-terminal Cys was added to aid in coupling to a solid support. HPLC-grade trifluoroacetic acid, maleimide-activated forms of keyhole limpet hemocyanin and bovine serum albumin, and Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvant were obtained from Pierce. An Affi-Gel HZ immunoaffinity kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. Elastatinal was obtained from Calbiochem. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. The production of rabbit anti-eIF4G1230-1248 (raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1230-1248 of human eIF4G), anti-eIF4G327-342, and anti-eIF4G403-416 antisera was described elsewhere(43Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody against eIF4A was a generous gift from Dr. Hans Trachsel, Bern, Switzerland. A goat anti-eIF3 antibody was kindly donated by Dr. William Merrick, Case Western Reserve University. Peptide 9 was coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer and used to raise anti-eIF4G653-666 antibodies in rabbits (500 μg/immunization; injections bimonthly for 3 months). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was prepared as described(44Adamson S.D. Herbert E. Godchaux W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Preparation of ribosomal salt wash and high salt postribosomal supernatant from rabbit reticulocytes, and purification of eIF4F and eIF3:eIF4F complexes from ribosomal salt wash, were as described previously(25Lamphear B.J.

Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liebig H.-D.

For the generation of cpN2 for N-terminal sequence analysis, high salt postribosomal supernatant (70 ml) from rabbit reticulocytes, dialyzed against buffer A100 (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM KCl) was incubated with L protease (0.5 μg/ml) for 20 min at 30°C and then applied to a 2-ml m7GTP-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A100 at 4°C. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A100 and 10 ml of buffer A100 containing 100 μM GTP. Bound material was eluted in buffer A100 containing 70 μM m7GTP. The eluate (3 ml) was further incubated with L protease (3 μg/ml) at 30°C for 20 min to complete the conversion of cpN to cpN1 and cpN2. The reaction mixture was cooled on ice, brought to 0.1% in trifluoroacetic acid, and fractionated by HPLC using a C4 column (0.45 × 15 cm) equilibrated in buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The column was developed at 1 ml/min with 5 ml of buffer B followed by a 1-ml step to 35% buffer C (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile) and a linear 39-ml gradient to 60% buffer C. Fractions of 1 ml were collected throughout and those shown by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to contain cpN1 and cpN2 were pooled and reapplied to the C4 column. The column was developed with 5 ml of buffer B followed by a 1-ml step to 30% buffer C and a linear 40-ml gradient to 45% buffer C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected throughout and those containing cpN2 were pooled and subjected to automated Edman degradation with an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequenator at the Louisiana State University Core Research Laboratories, New Orleans. For analysis of the time course of digestion, eIF4F (30 μg/ml), either in the presence or absence of eIF3 (70 μg/ml), was incubated at 30°C with L protease (12 μg/ml) in buffer A140 (buffer A100 except the KCl concentration was 140 mM). Aliquots (30 μl) were removed at various times and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For analysis of the eIF4G-eIF4E interaction by m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography, eIF4F (27 μg/ml) was incubated in buffer A150 in the presence of either 2A (8 μg/ml) or L protease (12 μg/ml) at 30°C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped with elastatinal (500 μM) or antipain (1 mM), respectively, and placed on ice. Samples were then loaded onto a 100-μl m7GTP-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A100, the column washed with 300 μl of buffer A100, and the bound material eluted with buffer A100 containing 70 μM m7GTP. Reactions (30 μl) containing the eIF3•eIF4F complex (560 μg/ml) were incubated at 30°C in buffer A80 in the absence or presence of either 2A protease (8.3 μg/ml) or L protease (95 μg/ml) for either 50 or 5 min, respectively. Reactions were stopped with protease inhibitors as described above, placed on ice, layered onto 4.4-ml 15-30% sucrose gradients prepared in buffer A80 and centrifuged in an SW60.1 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 16 h. For immunoblotting, unstained proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes in a BioRad Mini Trans-Blot cell using the manufacturer's recommendations. Detection of immunoreactive species was performed as described previously (43Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except incubations were performed at 22°C. Anti-eIF4G653-666 antiserum was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Anti-eIF4G1230-1248 resin was prepared using the Affi-Gel HZ immunoaffinity kit. The antibody was purified on protein A-Sepharose, and 1.5 mg were coupled through the carbohydrate moiety by a hydrazide linkage to 2 ml of agarose beads. For immunoadsorption, various combinations of eIF4A and eIF4F were incubated with FMDV L protease at 30°C in buffer D50 (buffer A50 containing 0.1% Tween 20). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 mM antipain. Aliquots (50 μl) were added to 450 μl of buffer D50 containing 0.5% non-fat dry milk and 100 μl of a 25% slurry of anti-eIF4G1230-1248 resin in buffer D50 containing 0.5% non-fat dry milk. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with continuous mixing and then the resin was sedimented by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 s, washed four times with cold buffer D50, and proteins eluted with 50 μl of 1.25 M NaCl, 0.25 M MgCl2. SDS-PAGE was performed for 90 min at 100 V using a Hoefer minigel electrophoresis system(46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by staining with either Coomassie Blue or silver (47Morrisey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar) or immunoblotting. A previous study indicated that, in addition to the primary cleavage of rabbit eIF4G by L protease at Gly479-Arg480, there were cleavages at several other sites(12Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize these secondary cleavages further, we combined purified recombinant L protease with rabbit reticulocyte eIF4F and performed a time course of digestion (Fig. 1). Proteolytic fragments were visualized by staining with silver (A) or immunoblotting with antibodies against different regions of eIF4G (B and C). Antibodies against peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 327-342, 403-416, and 1230-1248 were developed in an earlier study(43Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the central portion of the eIF4G sequence was not represented by these antibody reagents. We therefore developed an additional antibody against residues 653-666. As observed previously(12Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), L protease initially makes a single cleavage, separating the N-terminal one-third of eIF4G (here designated cpN) from the C-terminal two-thirds (designated cpC·; see Fig. 2). eIF4G migrates on SDS-PAGE as a series of heterogeneous bands with aberrantly slow mobility (Fig. 1, lane 1); the slowest species migrates at 220 kDa(6Etchison D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cause of the heterogeneity and aberrant mobility is not known, but the region of eIF4G responsible for this behavior appears to be located in cpN(12Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J.

Like intact eIF4G, cpN migrated abnormally slowly as a heterogeneous cluster of bands, with an apparent molecular mass of 100-130 kDa, despite its true size of 51 kDa (A and B, lanes 2-4).Figure 2:Summary of viral protease cleavage of eIF4G.

All members of the cpN1 cluster arose simultaneously and therefore are likely to have resulted from cleavage of cpN at a single site. The heterogeneity of cpN1 is similar to that of cpN and eIF4G itself, suggesting that the source of heterogeneity in eIF4G is localized to the cpN1 region. Immunoblotting with an anti-eIF4G327-342 antibody detected a band with estimated molecular mass of 28 kDa, designated cpN2, which appeared simultaneously with the degradation of cpN (B, lanes 2-4). With further digestion, some of cpN2 was converted to smaller species termed cpN3 (B, lanes 4-7). Immunoblotting with anti-eIF4G327-342 antibodies (B) and anti-eIF4G403-416 antibodies (data not shown) indicated that cpN2 and cpN3 contained amino acid residues 327-416, whereas cpN1 did not. This permitted the orientation of cpN1, cpN2, and cpN3 as shown in Fig. 2. Further cleavage of the 103-kDa cpC· yielded a number of smaller fragments (cpC1-cpC5). The relative abundance and kinetics of appearance of the fragments together with immunoblotting with anti-eIF4G653-666 (Fig. 1C) and anti-eIF4G1230-1248(12Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J.

Initial cleavage of cpC· by L protease can occur at one of two nearby sites (see Fig. 2). This yields two overlapping polypeptides, cpC1 (59 kDa) and cpC2 (55 kDa), both of which can be seen in A, lanes 4-7, and both of which react with anti-eIF4G1230-1248 antibodies(12Kirchweger R.

P-glycoprotein, also known as the multidrug-resistant protein (MDR), 1The abbreviations used are: MDRmultidrug-resistant proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNTAnitrilotriacetic acid. is a plasma membrane glycoprotein involved in the ATP-dependent efflux of a broad range of cytotoxic drugs from cells (reviewed by Endicott and Ling(1989), Roninson(1991), and Gottesman and Pastan(1993)). It may be one of the mechanisms responsible for failure of cancer chemotherapy (Bradley and Ling, 1994). multidrug-resistant protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nitrilotriacetic acid. In order to understand the mechanism of drug efflux it is necessary to identify the site(s) of drug binding, determine the role of the two nucleotide-binding domains, and characterize the interactions between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. One approach has been to analyze the effects of mutations on the ability of the enzyme to confer resistance to various cytotoxic agents (Loo and Clarke, 1993a, 1993b, 1994a, 1994b; Kajiji et al., 1994). This method is time consuming, however, and does not yield enough enzyme to directly measure function. In the absence of a direct assay, it is possible that the response of the cell to a cytotoxic agent could also involve activation of endogenous drug pump(s) or involve other mechanisms of drug resistance. Therefore, structure-function analysis of P-glycoprotein would be greatly enhanced if mutants could be rapidly expressed and purified in a functional state. To date, rapid expression and purification of eukaryotic membrane proteins have not been feasible. An approach that has been successfully applied to soluble proteins is metal-chelate chromatography of proteins containing a histidine tag (Janknecht et al., 1991). In this study, we used nickel chromatography to purify P-glycoprotein containing 10 histidine residues at the COOH end of the protein after expression in HEK 293 cells. We then used this approach to study the contribution of either nucleotide-binding domain of P-glycoprotein to drug-stimulated ATPase activity and characterized the drug-stimulated ATPase activities of mutants with altered drug-resistant profiles. We show that both nucleotide-binding domains are essential for coupling of ATPase activity to drug binding and that the drug-stimulated ATPase activities of all the mutants, except for F335A, correlated with their drug-resistant phenotypes. A full-length MDR1 cDNA was modified to encode for 10 histidine residues the COOH end of the protein. The sequence at the COOH terminus of P-glycoprotein that would normally end as TKRQ now became TKRA(His)10LDPR Q. Procedures for stable transfection of mouse NIH 3T3 cells, followed by selection in the presence of vinblastine (5 nM) or colchicine (45 nM) have been described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1993a). For purification of P-glycoprotein, twenty (10-cm diameter) culture dishes of subconfluent HEK 293 cells were transfected with MDR1 cDNA, and membranes were prepared 40 h later as described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1994c). The membranes were suspended in 0.3 ml of buffer A (50 mM NaPO4, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) and solubilized at 4°C by addition of 1 ml of buffer A containing 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (Sigma). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied onto a nickel spin column (Ni-NTA, Qiagen), which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside). The column was washed twice with 0.6 ml of buffer B and twice with 0.6 ml of buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 80 mM imidazole, pH 7, 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). P-glycoprotein-(His)10 was then eluted with 0.25 ml of buffer D (buffer C but containing 300 mM imidazole). The eluted material was diluted 6-fold with buffer A lacking imidazole and reapplied onto the same column that had been regenerated by washing with 1 M imidazole, 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside followed by equilibration in buffer B. The column was washed as described above, and P-glycoprotein was eluted with 0.25 ml of buffer D. The yield of P-glycoprotein was determined by measuring the amount of protein as described by Bradford(1976) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and subtracting the amount of protein obtained when the same number of vector-transfected cells was carried through the purification procedure. Yields of purified P-glycoprotein ranged from 6 to 12 μg. Purified P-glycoprotein was diluted with an equal volume of 50 mg/ml crude sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma), which had been previously washed with Tris-buffered saline to remove traces of phosphate and then sonicated. 100 ng of purified P-glycoprotein was incubated with the desired drug and ATPase activity initiated by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM ATP. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 40 min, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined by the method of Chifflet et al.(1988). The cDNA coding for P-glycoprotein was modified to contain 10 histidine residues at the COOH end of the molecule. The presence of the tag did not affect function since transfection of mouse NIH 3T3 cells yielded drug-resistant colonies that had drug-resistant profiles that were similar to those of wild-type enzyme (data not shown). To purify P-glycoprotein, its cDNA was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells as they yield a relatively high level of P-glycoprotein. More than 80% of the P-glycoprotein could be extracted from the membranes with the detergent n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside. The detergent also did not interfere with the binding of P-glycoprotein to the nickel column (>90% of P-glycoprotein was bound to the resin). Ionic detergents or inclusion of phospholipids during the purification procedure prevented binding of P-glycoprotein to the column. Other non-ionic detergents (Triton X-100 or C12E8 (octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether)) inactivated P-glycoprotein, while octyl glucoside was less effective (<20%) in solubilizing P-glycoprotein. SDS-PAGE of the fractions eluted with 300 mM imidazole (Fig. 1) shows the presence of a single major band of an apparent mass of 170 kDa (lane 6B), which is not present from cells transfected with vector alone (lane 6A). When the purified fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibody against human P-glycoprotein, the 170-kDa protein was the only immunoreactive band (data not shown). After one round of purification, greater than 50% of the eluted proteins was P-glycoprotein-(His)10. A second round of purification resulted in up to 80% of the protein being P-glycoprotein, with yields of 6-12 μg of P-glycoprotein. Occasionally a minor contaminating band of apparent mass 56 kDa was also present when a regenerated rather than a new nickel column was used during the second round of purification. Fig. 2 shows that wild-type P-glycoprotein-(His)10 in the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine had an ATPase activity of 0.11 μmol/min/mg of P-glycoprotein. In the absence of lipid, no ATPase activity was detected (<0.015 μmol/min/mg of P-glycoprotein). In the presence of verapamil and lipid, however, the ATPase activity increased about 11-fold (1.20 μmol/min/mg of P-glycoprotein). All ATPase activities were determined in the absence of EGTA and ouabain, as no Ca2+-ATPase or Na+-K+-ATPase activity was detected (assayed ± 2 mM EGTA or ± 2 mM ouabain, respectively). Lower levels of stimulation were observed in the presence of 800 μM colchicine (3.1-fold) and vinblastine (5.8-fold). Maximal stimulation of ATPase activity in the presence of vinblastine occurred at 20-50 μM, and the activity decreased at higher concentrations of vinblastine. We have previously identified residues in P-glycoprotein, which alter its ability to confer resistance to various cytotoxic drugs in transfected cells (Loo and Clarke, 1993a, 1993b, 1994a, 1994b). For example, mutants G141V or G830V conferred increased resistance to colchicine (about 3-fold) relative to that of wild-type enzyme while mutant F335A conferred decreased resistance to vinblastine. By contrast, mutant F978A conferred decreased resistance to all drugs. In this study, we also included for comparison mutant G185V, which was recently shown by Rao(1995) to have increased verapamil- and colchicine-stimulated ATPase activities (2- and 3.3-fold, respectively). Therefore, to determine the effects of these drugs on the ATPase activities of these mutants, we purified and reconstituted each mutant P-glycoprotein into phospholipid and measured ATPase activity in the presence of various concentrations of vinblastine, colchicine, or verapamil. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the major protein in each purified preparation had an apparent mass of 170 kDa (corresponding to the fully glycosylated form of P-glycoprotein) and was present in similar amounts (Fig. 3). The maximal verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities of mutants G141V, G185V, and G830V were all slightly increased (1.4-1.7-fold) relative to that of wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2). The half-maximal stimulation of the ATPase activities of the glycine mutants was 9-16 μM, compared with 40 μM for the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the mutants had increased affinity for verapamil. Vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activities of all three mutants, however, were similar to that of wild-type enzyme, whereas colchicine-stimulated ATPase activities were markedly increased (2.8-3.7-fold). Mutant F978A, which confers little resistance to vinblastine, colchicine, doxorubicin, or actinomycin D in transfected cells, also showed little drug-stimulated ATPase activity, except at very high concentrations of verapamil (1.04 μmol/min/mg of P-glycoprotein at 800 μM verapamil). Similarly, no colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity could be detected. Vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity, however, was detected at low concentrations of vinblastine (10-50 μM) but was 3-4-fold lower than that observed with wild-type enzyme. By contrast, mutation of Phe-335, which is found in an equivalent position to Phe-978, when homologous halves of P-glycoprotein are aligned resulted in a large increase in drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Maximal ATPase activities in the presence of verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine were 4-9-fold greater than that observed with wild-type enzyme. The basal ATPase activity of mutant F335A was also about 3-fold higher (0.32 μmol/min/mg of P-glycoprotein) than that of wild-type enzyme (0.11 μmol/min/mg of P-glycoprotein). Therefore, the major effect of mutation of Phe-335 was to increase the overall ATPase activity of the enzyme. P-glycoprotein is predicted to contain two nucleotide binding folds. Each fold contains a homology A consensus sequence (Walker et al., 1982) for nucleotide binding (GNSGCGKS and GSSGCGKS, respectively). We initially tested the ATPase activity of a mutant in which both cysteines in the homology A regions (Cys-431 and Cys-1074) as well as all other cysteines were mutated to alanines. The purified Cys-less P-glycoprotein had a higher amount of the core-glycosylated form (150 kDa) of P-glycoprotein (Fig. 3), which is probably due to the slow maturation of this mutant protein (Loo and Clarke, 1995). Fig. 4 shows that the Cys-less mutant retained approximately 70% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of wild-type enzyme. To determine the contribution of either nucleotide-binding domain to drug-stimulatable ATPase activity, mutations were made to the core amino acids (G432S, K433M, G1075S, and K1076M, respectively) of the homology A consensus sequences. No drug-resistant colonies were obtained when the cDNAs coding for these mutants were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells and selected in the presence of colchicine (45 nM) or vinblastine (5 nM). These mutants were then transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells and purified using Ni-NTA columns. All four mutants yielded a 170-kDa protein as the major product and in similar amounts to that obtained with wild-type P-glycoprotein-(His)10, suggesting that the mutations did not affect processing of the enzyme (Fig. 3). Mutations to the core amino acids (GK) in either nucleotide-binding domain abolished verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity (Fig. 4), suggesting that both nucleotide-binding domains are essential for coupling drug binding to ATPase activity. Purification of P-glycoprotein using nickel-chelate chromatography following transient expression in HEK 293 cells has several advantages over purification from stable cell lines overexpressing P-glycoprotein (Urbatsch et al., 1994; Shapiro and Ling, 1994; Sharom et al., 1993) or following expression in insect Sf9 cells (Rao, 1995). The main advantage is that the expression, purification, and assay of ATPase activity for any mutant P-glycoprotein can be completed within 2 days, while the other methods often take months. A transient expression system also avoids the problems associated with potential recombination of the mutant P-glycoprotein cDNA with any endogenous P-glycoprotein genes. Although the level of expression of P-glycoprotein is relatively low in HEK 293 cells (0.1-0.3% by weight), the use of nickel-chelate chromatography provided a simple and efficient method to isolate highly purified P-glycoprotein in an active state. This procedure should be applicable to the study of the structure-function relationships of other eukaryotic membrane proteins. In this study, we addressed two important questions concerning the structure and mechanism of P-glycoprotein: 1) are both ATP-binding sites required for drug stimulation of ATPase activity and 2) is there a correlation between the drug-resistant phenotype of a mutant and its pattern of drugstimulated ATPase activity? Our results suggest that both nucleotide-binding sites must be intact for coupling of ATPase activity to drug binding. Mutation of the core (GK) amino acids in either homology A nucleotide-binding consensus sequence abolished basal as well as drug-stimulated ATPase activity. It is possible that both sites must be occupied simultaneously for coupling of drug binding to ATPase activity or that ATP binding occurs sequentially during the reaction cycle. There is, however, no evidence of cooperativity between the nucleotide-binding sites (Sharom et al., 1995). Mutations that alter the drug-resistant profiles of P-glycoprotein also had profound effects on the pattern of drug-stimulated ATPase activities. For mutants G141V, G185V, G830V, and F978A, the pattern of drug-stimulated ATPase correlated with their relative drug-resistant profiles in transfected cells. In the glycine mutants, there was enhanced stimulation of ATPase activity by colchicine, whereas stimulation by vinblastine resembled that of wild-type enzyme. Similarly, in transfected cells, the relative resistance of these mutants to vinblastine was similar to that of wild-type enzyme, but the relative resistance to colchicine was elevated (about 3-fold). Mutant F978A conferred little resistance to all drug substrates in transfected cells, and the purified protein also showed extremely low levels of drug-stimulated ATPase activity. These results suggest that mutation of Phe-978 resulted in either decreased affinity (verapamil) and/or interference in coupling of drug binding to ATPase activity (vinblastine). Purified mutant F335A P-glycoprotein, however, showed large increases in ATPase activity in the presence of all three drug substrates but conferred decreased relative resistance to vinblastine and only a small increase in resistance to colchicine in transfected cells (Loo and Clarke, 1993b). One explanation for this discrepancy is that mutation F335A alters the dissociation of vinblastine from P-glycoprotein such that the enzyme is slow in effluxing vinblastine. It is also possible that the mutation alters the conformation of the enzyme such that is now in an “uncoupled” state. These possibilities could explain the fact that purified mutant F335A has a higher basal as well as drug-stimulated ATPase activity compared with wild-type enzyme. The results of this study show that drug-stimulated ATPase activity of a mutant does not always correlate with its drug-resistant phenotype.

The yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning system has now been used to identify additional proteins from Aplysia that interact directly with VAMP. A 33-kilodalton membrane protein, termed VAP-33 (VAMP-associated protein of 33 kilodaltons), was identified whose corresponding messenger RNA was detected only in the central nervous system and the gill of Aplysia. Presynaptic injection of antibodies specific for VAP-33 inhibited synaptic transmission, which suggests that VAP-33 is required for the exocytosis of neurotransmitter."

Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also contains the RNA helicase eIF-4A and eIF-4γ, and translation of messages with a high degree of secondary structure is enhanced by overexpression of eIF-4E(5Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF-4E could therefore provide an important mechanism for regulating cellular translation and particularly that of certain mRNAs. Although it remains unclear how phosphorylation of eIF-4E affects its activity, it has been reported to lead to increased association of eIF-4E with high molecular mass complexes, perhaps including the other subunits of eIF-4F(6Morley S.J.

A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), although phosphorylation is certainly not a prerequisite for it to bind.Several years ago, Rychlik et al.(9Rychlik W. Russ M.A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10434-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) presented evidence that the major site of phosphorylation of eIF-4E in rabbit reticulocytes was Ser-53. This apparent identification of Ser-53 as the site of phosphorylation was backed up by several studies employing a site-directed mutant of eIF-4E in which Ser-53 was altered to alanine. Such a mutant showed a number of differences from the wild-type protein when overexpressed in intact cells or when studied in vitro in that it did not induce cell transformation or promote abnormal morphology(10De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 11Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2979-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Evidence has, however, been presented that other phosphorylation sites exist in eIF-4E based on the fact that the S53A mutant still underwent phosphorylation(11Lazaris-Karatzas A.

Furthermore, we recently observed that the major insulin-stimulated eIF-4E kinase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was able to phosphorylate recombinant eIF-4E (S53A) to a similar extent compared with the wild-type recombinant protein. 2A. Flynn and C. G. Proud, unpublished data. Taken together, these findings prompted us to reinvestigate the site of phosphorylation in eIF-4E. 3Early in this study, we learned that Prof. R. E. Rhoads (Shreveport, LA) had also obtained data indicating that Ser-53 was not the major phosphorylation site in eIF-4E. Our data show that the major site of phosphorylation in eIF-4E in serum-stimulated CHO cells is Ser-209, close to the C terminus of the protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsm7GTP-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Carrier-free orthophosphate was purchased from Amersham Corp. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO.K1) cells were kindly provided by Dr. L. Ellis (Houston, TX). Materials for tissue culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Modified trypsin and sequencing-grade Lys-C and Glu-C were from Promega. Microcystin-LR was obtained from Calbiochem. Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were from Sigma.Cell Culture, Treatment, and LabelingCHO.K1 cells were grown and maintained in culture as described by Dickens et al.(15Dickens M. Chin J.E. Roth R.A. Ellis L. Denton R.M. Tavaré J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at an initial density of 5 × 105/60-mm dish and grown to near confluence (3-4 days) in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% (v/v) serum before being “stepped down” to 0.1% serum for 16 h. For 32P labeling, the cells were washed (2 × 5 ml) with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 3 h at 37°C in 2 ml of the same medium containing 1-1.5 mCi/ml 32Pi. Fetal calf serum was then added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and the cells were incubated for a further 10 min. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (15Dickens M. Chin J.E. Roth R.A. Ellis L. Denton R.M. Tavaré J.M. Biochem.

The beads were pelleted by a short centrifugation and washed once with 1 ml of extraction buffer (see (15Dickens M. Chin J.E. Roth R.A. Ellis L. Denton R.M. Tavaré J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)) containing 1% Triton X-100 and then twice with 1 ml of the same buffer containing only 0.1% Triton X-100. The pelleted beads were boiled with concentrated SDS sample buffer, and the entire sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 15% (w/v) acrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.) using a Semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad), and the membrane was washed extensively with deionized water before drying and subjecting to autoradiography overnight. 32P-Labeled eIF-4E was excised from the membrane, and the amount of radioactivity in each membrane piece was estimated by Cerenkov counting.Isoelectric Focusing and ImmunoblottingFor analysis of the phosphorylation state of eIF-4E by isoelectric focusing, cells were grown as described above, but with the omission of 32Pi. Extracts were prepared from either serum-stimulated or control (no addition) cells. eIF-4E was purified as described above, except that it was eluted from the m7GTP-Sepharose with 20 μl of m7GTP (100 μM, 30 min, 4°C). Following centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with concentrated (7×) isoelectric focusing sample buffer (16Redpath N.T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and urea to a final concentration of 9 M. Isoelectric focusing was performed using a modification of the reversed polarity method described by Maurides et al.(17Maurides P.A. Akkaraju G.R. Jagus R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The gel was prepared using ampholyte carriers in the pH range 3.5-10 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Western blotting was carried out as described (18Oldfield S. Jones B.L. Tanton D. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using an anti-eIF-4E antiserum prepared as described previously(11Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) and scanned by laser densitometry on a Joyce-Loebl Chromoscan 3 apparatus.Protein Chemical ProceduresTryptic digestion of 32P-labeled eIF-4E on polyvinylidene difluoride chips was performed by incubation with 20 μg of modified trypsin in 100 mMN-ethylmorpholine (pH 8) at 30°C for 16 h. For digestion with Lys-C, the membrane was incubated with 1 μg of the protease in 50 mM NaHCO3 (pH 9) for 1 h at 30°C; then another 1 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C was added; and incubation was continued for 15 h. The recovery of 32P counts from each membrane chip was monitored by Cerenkov counting. Radioactive tryptic fragments that did not elute immediately from the treated membrane were removed using a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (20% for the first extraction and then 60%). Typically, ~60% of the radioactivity in the membrane chip was recovered in this way. The elution washes were pooled and dried by vacuum centrifugation and then washed (5 × 50 μl) and resuspended in water.Glu-C digestion of the major radiolabeled tryptic product of eIF-4E was performed by scraping radioactive material from a thin-layer cellulose plate following two-dimensional mapping (see below) and washing extensively with water. The pooled supernatants were dried under vacuum, resuspended in water, and incubated with 1 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.8) for 16 h before processing as described above. Both the Glu-C and Lys-C preparations used digested completely ~1 μg of rabbit reticulocyte eIF-2 (data not shown) under the same conditions.HPLCSeparation of 32P-labeled tryptic products of eIF-4E by HPLC was performed using a C18 column (Brownlee, Spheri-5, 2.1-mm diameter, 5-μm particles). Samples were prepared as described above and centrifuged through a 10-kDa cutoff Ultrafree-MC unit (Millipore Corp.). The column was pre-equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile and developed using a gradient of 2-30% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min, 30-60% in 5 min, and to 95% in 1 min. 100-μl fractions were collected, and the radioactive material was located by Cerenkov counting. The same method was used to compare the behavior of the unlabeled synthetic peptide SGS(P)TTK on the C18 column, except that the protein peaks were detected by monitoring absorbance at 215 nm.Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisPhosphoamino acid analysis was performed on intact 32P-labeled eIF-4E that had been resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The sample was hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl at 105°C for 75 min. Electrophoresis was performed in one dimension (pH 3.5) for 1.5 h at 400 V, and the dried thin-layer cellulose plate was subjected to autoradiography. 1 μg each of nonradioactive phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were loaded as standards and carriers and detected by ninhydrin staining.Radiosequencing by Manual Edman DegradationThe peak fraction of counts following separation of tryptic products from 32P-labeled eIF-4E by reverse-phase chromatography (see above) was dried under vacuum and washed and resuspended in water. A sample was removed for analysis by manual Edman degradation, performed exactly as described earlier(19Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). An aliquot of starting material and samples from each round of degradation were loaded onto a thin-layer cellulose plate and electrophoresed in one dimension (pH 3.5) for 25 min at 1 kV. 32Pi was loaded as a standard, and the dried plate was subjected to autoradiography.Two-dimensional Peptide MappingSamples were analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping, as described previously(19Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar), at pH 3.5 and 1.9. The thin-layer cellulose plates were dried and either subjected to autoradiography (for 32P-labeled samples) or sprayed with ninhydrin (to detect the unlabeled synthetic phosphopeptide). A mixture of 2,4-dinitrophenyllysine/cyanol (~1 μg of each) was loaded as a marker.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAs we have previously reported, 4A. Flynn and C. G. Proud, submitted for publication. isoelectric focusing analysis reveals the existence of only two distinct species of eIF-4E in CHO cells as detected by immunoblotting, and treatment of isolated eIF-4E with alkaline phosphatase causes conversion of all the factor to the more basic (i.e. unphosphorylated) form. Fig. 1A shows an immunoblot of eIF-4E from control and serum-treated CHO.K1 cells: in the former case, only 20% of the eIF-4E is phosphorylated, while in serum-treated cells, almost all the factor (~80%) is in the more acidic (phosphorylated) form. These findings are consistent with the data from a range of other cell types indicating that eIF-4E contains one major phosphorylation site(20Sonenberg N. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).To determine which type of amino acid was phosphorylated in eIF-4E in CHO.K1 cells, serum-starved cells were incubated with radioactive inorganic phosphate and briefly treated with serum, and eIF-4E was then isolated and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. Only phosphoserine was observed (Fig. 1B), which is consistent with several other reports using a range of different cell types (see (20Sonenberg N. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), for a review), although phosphothreonine has been reported in eIF-4E under some conditions (see, for example, (7Bu X. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4975-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)).It thus appeared likely that eIF-4E was phosphorylated at a single serine residue in serum-treated CHO.K1 cells. To investigate further the location of the phosphoserine residue in eIF-4E, radiolabeled factor was isolated from serum-treated cells and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by separation of the resulting peptides by reverse-phase chromatography (Fig. 2). Two separate experiments were performed, and in both cases, one major peak of radioactive material was observed. This peak eluted at ~8% acetonitrile, indicating that the material was very hydrophilic.

In both experiments, the first peak contained ~75% of the total radioactive material, and this was contained within one fraction, whereas the later material emerged as a broad smear.Figure 2:HPLC analysis of the tryptic phosphopeptides from 32P-labeled eIF-4E. Reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column was performed for the products of trypsinolysis of 32P-labeled eIF-4E from serum-treated CHO.K1 cells (A) or for a nonradiolabeled synthetic phosphopeptide, SGS(P)TTK (B), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The flow rate was 0.1 ml/min; 100-μl fractions were collected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed to characterize radiolabeled material contained in the main peak from reverse-phase chromatography. Fig. 3A (panel i) shows that one positively charged phosphopeptide was obtained when electrophoresis was performed at pH 1.9; this phosphopeptide migrated slightly faster than cyanol (which has a net charge of +1 at this pH). The same result was obtained at pH 3.5, except that the peptide and cyanol did not migrate as quickly toward the cathode (data not shown). Consistent with the findings of other groups(14Bu X.

Electrophoresis was performed at pH 1.9. Only the parts of the map containing marker or peptide are shown; no other radiolabeled material was observed. B, manual Edman degradation was performed using a sample of the HPLC-purified tryptic product of 32P-labeled eIF-4E.

Pi, [32P]orthophosphate marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the position of the phosphoserine residue in the tryptic product, manual Edman analysis was performed, with samples being retained after every cycle for further analysis by one-dimensional mapping. The initial peptide and the products obtained after one or two cycles had a net positive charge (Fig. 3B). However, after the third cycle, ~75% of the radioactivity no longer migrated with positively charged material, but instead moved in the opposite direction and migrated with inorganic phosphate. Furthermore, the fourth round of degradation yielded [32P]orthophosphate only, with no counts remaining in the position of the original phosphopeptide (data not shown). These data indicate that the third residue in the peptide bears the radiolabel, and given the conclusions drawn from the phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 1B), the tryptic peptide therefore contains a phosphoserine at position 3.There are no sequence data available for eIF-4E from the Chinese hamster. However, there is a very high degree of identity between rabbit, mouse, and human eIF-4E(22Rychlik W. Domier L. Gardner P.R. Hellmann G.M. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6415Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24McCubbin W.D. Edery I. Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Kay C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17663-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the only significant differences are in the extreme N terminus of the factor (residues 12, 16, and 17), while the remainder of the eIF-4E sequence is 99.5% identical. We therefore examined the sequences of these proteins to identify possible candidates for the tryptic peptide obtained in our studies. In each case, there are three serines that lie three residues C-terminal to a tryptic cleavage site (Lys or Arg). Attempts to purify sufficient amounts of the tryptic phosphopeptide from eIF-4E in CHO.K1 cells were unsuccessful. Therefore, to distinguish between these three possible phosphorylation sites, further proteolytic digests were performed. In the case of Ser-64 in the tryptic peptide LIS64K, digestion of the intact 32P-labeled factor with Lys-C would yield a much larger and more hydrophobic phosphopeptide (TWQANLRLISK) than that obtained by tryptic digestion, which would migrate quite differently on two-dimensional peptide mapping. However, as shown in Fig. 3A (panel ii), the migration of the phosphopeptide produced with Lys-C was identical to that of the tryptic product at pH 1.9 (and also at pH 3.5; data not shown), ruling out Ser-64 as the phosphorylation site.In the case of Ser-24 in the tryptic peptide TES24NQEVANPEHYIK, treatment of the tryptic phosphopeptide with Glu-C would be expected to generate a smaller species with altered mobility on electrophoresis and chromatography. However, Fig. 3A (panel iii) shows that after Glu-C treatment, the migration of the phosphopeptide was unchanged on two-dimensional mapping at pH 1.9 (and also at pH 3.5; data not shown), indicating that Ser-24 is not the radiolabeled residue. By a process of elimination, then the phosphorylation site in eIF-4E in CHO cells appears to be Ser-209 in the tryptic peptide SGS209TTK, consistent with the recent findings of the Rhoads' laboratory.3As a final confirmation of the identity of the phosphorylation site in eIF-4E, a synthetic phosphopeptide (SGS(P)TTK) that corresponds to residues 207-212 of eIF-4E was prepared. This peptide showed identical behavior to that of the tryptic product from 32P-labeled eIF-4E on (i) reverse-phase chromatography (Fig. 2), (ii) electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (Fig. 3A (panel iv)) or (iii) at pH 3.5 (data not shown), and (iv) thin-layer chromatography (Fig. 3A (panel iv)). This strongly supports the identification of the labeled phosphopeptide and confirms that the phosphorylated residue is indeed Ser-209.In conclusion, all these data indicate that the major (and probably the only) phosphorylation site in CHO cells is Ser-209. Reappraisal of the role of phosphorylation of eIF-4E is therefore required using mutants based on Ser-209. This work also highlights the need for caution when using Ser to Ala mutants of proteins to investigate the role of phosphorylation, as this approach has given phenotypes not related to phosphorylation in two translation initiation factors, i.e. eIF-4E (discussed above) and eIF-2α(25Kaufman R.J.

Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF-4E could therefore provide an important mechanism for regulating cellular translation and particularly that of certain mRNAs. Although it remains unclear how phosphorylation of eIF-4E affects its activity, it has been reported to lead to increased association of eIF-4E with high molecular mass complexes, perhaps including the other subunits of eIF-4F(6Morley S.J.

Russ M.A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10434-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) presented evidence that the major site of phosphorylation of eIF-4E in rabbit reticulocytes was Ser-53. This apparent identification of Ser-53 as the site of phosphorylation was backed up by several studies employing a site-directed mutant of eIF-4E in which Ser-53 was altered to alanine. Such a mutant showed a number of differences from the wild-type protein when overexpressed in intact cells or when studied in vitro in that it did not induce cell transformation or promote abnormal morphology(10De Benedetti A.

Furthermore, we recently observed that the major insulin-stimulated eIF-4E kinase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was able to phosphorylate recombinant eIF-4E (S53A) to a similar extent compared with the wild-type recombinant protein. 2A.

Rhoads (Shreveport, LA) had also obtained data indicating that Ser-53 was not the major phosphorylation site in eIF-4E. Our data show that the major site of phosphorylation in eIF-4E in serum-stimulated CHO cells is Ser-209, close to the C terminus of the protein."

The cDNA was amplified by PCR with the GK sense GATGCTGGATGACAGAGCCAGGATG and antisense CAATTGAGGAGGATGCCCTTGTCTAG primers. PCR consisted of 30 cycles of 1 min each at 94°C, 60°C, and 72°C. The amplified fragments were fractionated on a 1.25% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Islets were isolated from 8-week-old male mice as described(14Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Safomiu S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Liver samples were obtained following the hyperglycemic clamp studies as detailed below. The tissues were homogenized and assayed for glucose phosphorylation activity by a fluorescent method as described(9Liang Y. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16863-16866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vmax values are determined by Eadie-Hofstee plots with the best-fitted lines drawn by the method of least squares. Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer II, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Plasma insulin was quantitated by a radioimmunoassay using a rat insulin standard. Four- to 6-month-old male mice (28-35 g) were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally), and an indwelling catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein as described previously(15Rossetti L. Shulman G.I. Zawalich W. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16Giaccari A. Rossetti L. J. Clin.

Mice were studied 4-6 days post-surgery in the awake, unrestrained state using the hyperglycemic clamp technique in combination with infusion of high performance liquid chromatography-purified glucose (DuPont NEN; 10 μCi bolus, 0.1 μCi/min) as described previously (15Rossetti L. Shulman G.I. Zawalich W. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Mice were fasted for 6 h before the infusion. A variable infusion of a 25% glucose solution was started at time zero and periodically adjusted to clamp the plasma glucose concentration at 15-18 mM. The studies lasted 170 min and included an 80-min basal period for assessment of basal turnover rates and a 90-min hyperglycemic clamp period. Plasma samples for determination of [3H]glucose specific activity were obtained from the tail vein at 40, 60, 70, and 80 min during the basal period and at 40, 60, 70, 80, and 90 min during the clamp period. Steady-state conditions for the plasma glucose concentration and specific activity were achieved within 40 min in both the basal and clamp periods of the studies. Plasma samples for determination of plasma insulin concentrations were obtained at −40, 0, 40, 60, 70, 80, and 90 min. The total volume of blood drawn was ~0.9 ml; to prevent volume depletion and anemia, 1.2 ml of fresh blood (obtained by heart puncture from a littermate of the test animal) and heparinized saline (10 units/ml) (1:1, v/v) was infused during the study. At the end of the glucose infusion, mice were anesthetized with 60 mg/kg pentobarbital intravenously, the abdomen was quickly opened, portal vein blood obtained, and the liver freeze-clamped in situ with aluminum tongs precooled in liquid nitrogen. The time from the injection of the anesthetic until freeze-clamping of the liver was less than 45 s. All tissue samples were stored at −80°C for subsequent analysis. Plasma [3H]glucose radioactivity was measured in duplicate in the supernatants of Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 precipitates (Somogyi procedure) of plasma samples (25 μl) after evaporation to dryness to eliminate tritiated water(16Giaccari A. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Under steady-state conditions the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd) equals the rate of glucose appearance (Ra). The latter was calculated as the ratio of the rate of infusion of [3-3H]glucose (dpm/min) and the steady-state plasma [3H]glucose specific activity (dpm/μmol). Hepatic UDP-glucose (UDPG) concentration and specific activity in the liver were obtained through two sequential chromatographic separations, as reported previously(16Giaccari A. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin.

A targeting vector was constructed in which a fragment of the mouse GK gene spanning exon 2 was replaced with a neomycin resistance gene, resulting in a deletion and frameshift in the transcript (Fig. 1A). This vector was used to disrupt the GK gene in embryonic stem (ES) cells and generate mice heterozygous for the mutation (Fig. 1B). Analysis of glucose phosphorylation activity in islet homogenates of GK +/− mice revealed a 37% reduction compared with GK +/+ littermates (Table 1). This value is less than the expected 50% reduction in activity and may represent compensation by increased transcription of the wild-type allele, increased translation or stability of the wild-type GK mRNA, or by post-translational mechanisms. Liver GK activity in GK +/− mice was reduced by 28% compared with GK +/+ controls (Table 1). Based on the documented inducibility of the liver GK promoter by insulin(10Magnuson M.A. Shelton K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15936-15942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Iynedjian P.B. Pilot P.R. Nouspikel T. Milburn J.L. Quaade C. Hughes S. Ucla C. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7838-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the wild-type allele could be expected to fully compensate for the reduced GK activity caused by the mutant allele. However, the liver GK activity observed in the GK +/− mice represents only partial compensation. There were no statistically significant differences in activity of the ubiquitous hexokinase in both islets and liver of GK +/− compared with control mice (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Plasma glucose levels in fed GK +/− mice were normal; however, overnight fasting levels were 25% higher than those of GK +/+ littermates (Table 2). Thus, the reduced GK activity induces mildly elevated fasting glucose levels in the GK +/− mice, as is the case in MODY patients(6Velho G. Frougel P. Clement K. Pueyo M.A. Rakotoambinina B. Zouali H.

Plasma insulin levels were not significantly different in the GK +/− mice, compared with GK +/+ controls (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine the β-cell and hepatic response to elevated blood glucose levels, hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed in chronically catheterized conscious mice. The plasma glucose concentration was raised to an average of 15-18 mM during a 90-min infusion period, and the rate of glucose infusion (GIR) required to maintain the plasma glucose at this level provided an index of glucose tolerance. The average GIR during the last 50 min of the clamp was decreased by 40% in GK +/− as compared to GK +/+ mice (417 ± 50 versus 700 ± 33 μmol/kg•min) (Fig. 2C). The rate of glucose uptake (Rd) was decreased by 44% in the GK +/− mice (Fig. 2B). These values reflect a decreased tolerance to glucose, which is similar to that observed in MODY patients(6Velho G. Frougel P. Clement K. Pueyo M.A. Rakotoambinina B. Zouali H. Passa P. Cohen D. Robert J.-J. Lancet. 1992; 340: 444-448Abstract PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Byrne M.M. Sturis J. Clement K.

The reduced GIR could be due to decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion and/or altered glucose metabolism. Glucose-induced insulin secretion during the hyperglycemic clamp was 37% lower in GK +/− compared with GK +/+ mice (6.9 ± 2.6 versus 11.0 ± 3.1 ng of insulin/μmol of plasma glucose; n = 6−8). However, this difference did not achieve statistical significance, due to data variability. Hyperglycemia inhibits hepatic glucose production (HGP) and stimulates hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. This process requires enhanced phosphorylation of plasma glucose in hepatocytes, resulting in increased flux through GK. An impairment in hepatic glucose phosphorylation capacity may cause impaired hepatic adaptation to changes in plasma glucose concentrations. These parameters were assessed by infusing [3-3H]glucose during the hyperglycemic clamp studies and determining HGP and hepatic UDPG formed from plasma glucose. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia reduced HGP by 72% in GK +/+ mice and by only 47% in GK +/− mice (Table 3). The relative contribution of plasma glucose to liver glycogen repletion was evaluated by calculating the ratio of the specific activities of hepatic [3H]UDPG and portal vein plasma glucose, which provides a measure of the contribution of plasma glucose to the hepatic UDPG pool (“direct” pathway), as opposed to UDPG generated by gluconeogenesis. As shown in Table 3, the contribution of the direct pathway to hepatic UDPG was markedly decreased in GK +/− mice compared with GK +/+ mice. A significant correlation (r = 0.47; p < 0.05) was demonstrated between the GIR during the hyperglycemic clamp studies and the fraction of hepatic UDPG derived from the direct pathway in the two groups combined. Thus a modest decrease in liver GK activity in the GK +/− mice is sufficient to affect hepatic glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that abnormalities in liver glucose metabolism contribute to the MODY disease.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Breeding of heterozygous mutants failed to generate GK −/− mice. Approximately one third of the embryos in timed pregnancies were found to be resorbed starting at E9.5, indicating that the absence of GK is lethal to embryos. At this stage, only primordial buds of liver and exocrine pancreas without islets are observed. Nevertheless, RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from wild-type E9.5 embryos revealed significant GK expression (Fig. 3), and E9.5 embryo extracts contained GK enzymatic activity (data not shown). Breeding of GK mutant mice with a transgenic mouse line expressing a GK transgene rescued the homozygous mutant, 2K. Niswender, M. A. Magnuson, and S. Efrat, unpublished results. demonstrating that the embryonic lethality results from the absence of GK activity. These findings suggest an important function for GK during development; however, the cell types in which its activity is required remain to be identified. In conclusion, disruption of one allele of the GK gene is associated with decreased tolerance to glucose and moderate impairments in both hepatic and β-cell glucose sensing. Thus a partial reduction in mouse islet and liver GK activity causes a disease very similar to human MODY, underscoring the key role of GK in maintaining glucose homeostasis. In contrast, a β-cell specific reduction of GK activity in transgenic mice, which results in a decreased insulin secretory response to glucose, is not sufficient to cause detectable changes in fasting plasma glucose levels or glucose tolerance(12Efrat S. Leiser M. Wu Y.-J. Fusco-DeMane D. Emran O.A. Surana M. Jetton T. Magnuson M. Weir G. Fleischer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the MODY disease results from abnormal glucose metabolism in both islets and liver. The GK +/− mice will allow studies on genetic and environmental factors that may interact with the impaired GK activity to cause overt diabetes, as well as testing of therapeutic approaches to restore normal glucose homeostasis.

In human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), 5-LO moves from the cytosol to the nuclear envelope (NE) to interact with FLAP. However, 5-LO has recently been found within the nucleus, as well as the cytosol, of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and alveolar macrophages (AMs). To assess whether nuclear 5-LO can contribute to LT synthesis in these cells, we investigated whether this enzyme pool 1) translocates upon cell activation, 2) co-localizes with FLAP, and 3) is enzymatically active. By cell fractionation followed by immunoblotting, both cytosolic and nuclear soluble 5-LO decreased dramatically in RBL cells following activation with the calcium ionophore A23187. Concurrently, 5-LO increased in the pelletable nuclear pool, where FLAP was also detected. The loss of both cytosolic and nuclear soluble 5-LO, with concomitant increase exclusively at the NE, as well as co-localization with FLAP, were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent and confocal microscopy. In AMs, the nuclear soluble pool of 5-LO moved to the NE, where FLAP was also found; however, the cytosolic 5-LO pool did not translocate. Application of these methods to PMNs confirmed that cytosolic 5-LO moved to the nuclear envelope and co-localized with FLAP. By cell-free assay, nuclear soluble proteins from both RBL cells and AMs, but not PMNs, were able to generate 5-LO products from arachidonate, and this was inhibited by the direct 5-LO inhibitor zileuton. Cytosolic proteins from all cell types also showed cell-free 5-LO activity. These results demonstrate three distinct patterns of 5-LO translocation that are specific for each cell type: translocation of only a cytosolic pool in PMNs, of only a nuclear pool in AMs, and of both cytosolic and nuclear pools in RBL cells.

The synthesis of LTs from arachidonic acid is catalyzed by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Activation of 5-LO is thought to be initiated by the translocation of the enzyme from a soluble pool to a bound site(3Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1436-1442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), actual identification of the soluble site in resting cells and the bound site in activated cells has only recently been attempted. Using immunoelectron microscopy, Woods et al.(11Woods J. Evans J. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P. Hearn L. Charleson S. Heibein J. Singer I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that 5-LO co-localized at the nuclear envelope (NE) with FLAP in activated leukocytes. However, 5-LO could not be detected in resting cells by this technique, presumably because of loss of soluble protein during cell processing. Using indirect immunofluorescent microscopy and cell fractionation combined with immunoblotting, we recently demonstrated that 5-LO is indeed in the cytosol of resting neutrophils(12Brock T.G. Paine II, R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that 5-LO moves from the cytosol to the NE in PMNs. This pattern, which we have also recognized in rat peritoneal macrophages(13Peters-Golden M. McNish R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), forms the basis for the current model for 5-LO translocation during cell activation.Recently, we have examined the localization of 5-LO in two other cell types that produce abundant LTs in response to activation, RBL cells and AMs. Using a variety of techniques, we have demonstrated the presence of abundant 5-LO within the nucleus, as well as in the cytosol, of both resting RBL cells (12Brock T.G. Paine II, R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and AMs(14Woods J. Coffey M. Brock T. Singer I. Peters-Golden M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the nuclear pool of 5-LO functions in LT synthesis. Since translocation is an important early event in 5-LO action, translocation of nuclear 5-LO would support a role in LT synthesis. In previous studies, 5-LO translocation has been observed in RBL cells(15Wong A. Hwang S.M. Cook M.N. Hogaboom G.K. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6763-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Wong A. Cook M. Foley J. Sarau H. Marshall P. Hwang S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but not in AMs(17Coffey M. Peters-Golden M. Fantone III, J. Sporn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in none of these studies was nuclear material examined. In fact, cells typically were disrupted using harsh techniques that disrupted nuclei, thus mixing nuclear soluble proteins with cytosol; moreover, much nuclear material was discarded in early processing steps. Thus, the fate of nuclear 5-LO has never been considered.Efficient arachidonate processing by 5-LO requires three features: 1) translocation of 5-LO, 2) co-localization with FLAP, and 3) the ability to enzymatically convert arachidonate to 5-LO products. In the present study, we have used a variety of techniques to assess the ability of nuclear 5-LO, as well as cytosolic 5-LO, to contribute to LT synthesis in RBL cells and AMs, using these criteria. For comparison, we have performed parallel experiments with PMNs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCellsRBL-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in minimal essential medium-α (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin, fed 2 days later and used on the 3rd day, as described previously(12Brock T.G. Paine II, R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human neutrophils (PMNs) were isolated from venous blood drawn from normal volunteers. Purification involved the sequential steps of centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes(17Coffey M. Peters-Golden M. Fantone III, J. Sporn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AMs were obtained from respiratory disease-free female Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) by bronchoalveolar lavage (18Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Hyzy R. Shelly C. Toews G.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar) and used immediately. Purity of both PMN and AM preparations was greater than 95%. Cell viability in all preparations was greater than 95%, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion.Subcellular FractionationPBS-washed cells were resuspended in ice-cold sucrose-TKM buffer (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA) with protease inhibitors (1 mM each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and leupeptin) at 107 cells ml-1 and subjected to nitrogen cavitation at 400 p.s.i., 5 min, 4°C. This method was found, in preliminary experiments, to achieve maximal cell breakage, judged by trypan blue exclusion, while leaving nuclei apparently intact, as judged by microscopic analysis. The resulting cavitate was centrifuged at 1000 × g, 10 min, 4°C to pellet nuclei. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C; the resulting soluble fraction was designated “cytosol” and the pellet, which should include primarily plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, but also cytoskeletal proteins, was designated “membrane.” Isolated nuclei were disrupted by sonication (10 bursts at 20% duty cycle) with a Branson sonicator and soluble and pelletable fractions separated by ultracentrifugation as described. The nuclear pelletable fraction should include NE, DNA and associated proteins, and nuclear structural proteins.Immunoblot Analysis of Subcellular FractionsAliquots of subcellular fractions were sonicated (10 bursts at 20% duty cycle), and protein concentrations were determined by a modified Coomassie dye-binding assay (Pierce), using BSA as the standard. Samples were then subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously(13Peters-Golden M. McNish R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples containing 1-10 μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes then were blocked, washed, and probed with either rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against purified human leukocyte 5-LO (a generous gift from Dr. J. Evans, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Pointe Claire-Dorval, Quebec, Canada) (11Woods J. Evans J. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P. Hearn L. Charleson S. Heibein J. Singer I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal antibody against amino acid residues 41-52 of the human FLAP sequence (also a gift from Dr. J. Evans, Merck Frosst)(19Mancini J. Prasit P. Coppolino M. Charleson P. Leger S. Evans J. Gillard J. Vickers P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 267-272PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at titers of 1:5000, then detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary (1:5000) followed by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Multiple exposure times were taken for all blots to ensure that band densities were within the linear range of exposure. Band densities were quantitated by video densitometry using image analysis software from Scion.Indirect Immunofluorescent MicroscopyAs described previously(12Brock T.G. Paine II, R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1% BSA in PBS, and mounted on slides by Cytospin (500 rpm, 1 min). Mounted cells were incubated in PBS with 1 mM CaCl2, and in some cases subsequently they were transferred to the same solution containing the calcium ionophore A23187. Cells were fixed in −20°C methanol for 30 min, permeabilized in −20°C acetone, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS containing nonimmune goat serum. Primary antibodies were prepared in 1% BSA-PBS (5-LO, 1:100; FLAP, 1:60) and applied for 1 h, 37°C. Mounts were washed with 1% BSA-PBS, and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200; Sigma) for 1 h, 37°C, then washed extensively and placed on coverslips. For each antibody, similar results were obtained if cells were instead fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 30 min, 22°C, and permeabilized with 0.1% Tween 20 in 3% BSA-PBS, or if cells were fixed prior to mounting. Fluorescence was visualized with a Nikon Labophot 2 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Confocal imaging of identically stained samples was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal microscope, with pinhole aperture adjusted to give the minimal optical slice thickness (approximately 0.3 μm).5-Lipoxygenase ActivityCell-free 5-LO activity was determined using a modification of the method of Percival et al.(20Percival M. Denis D. Riendeau D. Gressler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cytosol or nuclear soluble fractions (100 μl, approximately 100 μg) were mixed with 900 μl of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 13.3 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) containing unlabeled arachidonic acid (20 μM; Nu-Chek) plus arachidonic acid (approximately 4 × 105 dpm; specific activity, 100 mCi/mmol; DuPont NEN). In some cases, the specific, direct 5-LO inhibitor zileuton was included (final concentration, 3 μM, which blocked 5-LO product formation ~90%, but reduced prostaglandin formation by <10% in preliminary experiments on whole cells). After 15 min at room temperature the reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes of ether, MeOH, 1 M citric acid (30:4:1 (v:v:v)) and vortexing. Following brief centrifugation the ether phase was removed and evaporated under nitrogen in glass vials. Samples were stored under N2 at −20°C. Lipid residues were dissolved in acetonitrile/water (1:1) and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously(17Coffey M. Peters-Golden M. Fantone III, J. Sporn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5-LO specific activity was calculated, based on conversion of arachidonic acid to 5-HPETE/5-HETE plus LTB4/LTA4 metabolites, and was expressed as nanomoles/mg of protein/15 min(17Coffey M. Peters-Golden M. Fantone III, J. Sporn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical AnalysesAll results are representative of at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated by a paired Student's t test, using a p value of 0.05.RESULTSTranslocation of 5-LO in Activated RBL Cells5-LO was found in all fractions of resting RBL cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A), as described previously(12Brock T.G. Paine II, R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is, soluble pools of 5-LO were found in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and bound 5-LO was evident in both membrane and nuclear pelletable fractions. Following stimulation of RBL cells with ionophore for 15 min, 5-LO decreased dramatically in both soluble pools. 5-LO increased predominantly in the nuclear pelletable pool; increases in 5-LO in the membrane fraction were not statistically significant (Fig. 1, A and B). As noted above, the nuclear pellet should include NE, DNA and associated proteins, and nuclear structural proteins. In resting RBL cells, the 5-LO associated with this nuclear pelletable fraction has previously been characterized as tightly bound and not membrane-associated(12Brock T.G. Paine II, R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, very little 5-LO was solubilized from this fraction by detergent extraction (Fig. 1C, left). In contrast to this situation in resting cells, abundant 5-LO could be solubilized from the nuclear pellet of stimulated cells (Fig. 1C, right), suggesting that, following stimulation, 5-LO had become associated with the NE.FLAP protein was localized primarily in the nuclear pelletable fraction of resting RBL cells, with some detectable protein also in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1D). As mentioned above, the membrane fraction should include endoplasmic reticulum, which has previously been identified as being a minor site for FLAP protein(11Woods J. Evans J. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P. Hearn L. Charleson S. Heibein J. Singer I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Cell activation with ionophore did not alter the distribution of FLAP (Fig. 1D). Detergent treatment extracted FLAP from the nuclear pelletable fractions of either resting or activated cells (data not shown). Similar results, for 5-LO and FLAP, were obtained when cells were initially disrupted using Dounce homogenization, rather than nitrogen cavitation (data not shown).These results using immunoblot analysis indicated that, upon activation, 5-LO, originating from two distinct soluble pools, translocated to the NE, where it co-localized with FLAP. To confirm this interpretation, the localization of 5-LO in intact, individual cells was studied using indirect immunofluorescent microscopy. RBL cells mounted on slides were immersed in medium with or without ionophore. At given times, cells were immersed in fixative to stop the process of translocation. As reported previously(12Brock T.G. Paine II, R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resting cells consistently displayed a characteristic “granular” distribution of 5-LO within the nucleus, with a less pronounced, diffuse staining in the cytosol (Fig. 2A). Within 10 s after ionophore addition, two changes were evident, cytosolic staining for 5-LO had diminished, and within the nucleus, the pattern of 5-LO staining changed from granular to diffuse (Fig. 2B). Residual cytosolic staining, particularly around the nucleus, as well as some persistent granular staining within the nucleus, was apparent in a minority of cells (<20%) at this early time point. By 5 min, essentially all cytosolic 5-LO was depleted, and some 5-LO appeared to reside at the NE, as evidenced by the appearance of membrane folds in some cells (Fig. 2C). This pattern was consistently seen in most cells examined at 7.5 and 10 min after ionophore addition (not shown).Figure 2:Localization of 5-LO and FLAP in resting and activated RBL cells by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy. Slide-mounted RBL cells were fixed before (A) or after 10 s (B), 5 min (C), or 15 min (D-F) of activation with 1 μM A23187. Preparations were then stained with anti-5-LO (A-D), anti-FLAP (E), or nonimmune serum (F). Bar corresponds to 50 μm for all micrographs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With longer activation times, a second change in 5-LO distribution became apparent. By 15 min after ionophore addition, 5-LO was no longer diffusely dispersed throughout the nucleus. Instead, larger amounts of 5-LO were concentrated at the NE, as indicated by a pronounced nuclear “rimming” pattern of fluorescence (Fig. 2D). This pattern of 5-LO distribution was quite similar to that of FLAP in RBL cells (Fig. 2E). In contrast to the staining for 5-LO or FLAP, control staining with nonimmune serum was minimal (Fig. 2F).The change in 5-LO pattern between 5 and 15 min of activation could result from the translocation of a dispersed intranuclear pool to the nuclear envelope during that interval. To address this possibility, we used confocal microscopy to obtain thin optical sections through the nucleus 5 and 15 min after activation. As compared with resting cells (Fig. 3A), thin sections of nuclei from RBL cells activated for 5 min (Fig. 3B) were characterized by diffuse fluorescence across the nucleus, with no pronounced signal at the nuclear envelope. Scans of nuclei from cells activated for 15 min showed much less 5-LO inside the nucleus and much more at the NE (Fig. 3C). Thus, translocation of nuclear 5-LO involved two steps, the first being the rapid dispersion of 5-LO throughout the nucleus, followed by a slower movement to the NE.Figure 3:Visualization of nuclear pools of 5-LO in activated RBL cells by optical sectioning using confocal microscopy. Resting cells (A) or cells activated for 5 min (B) or 15 min (C) with 1 μM A23187 were stained with anti-5-LO and visualized by confocal microscopy. Aperture for laser excitation was adjusted to provide the minimum thickness of optical slice (approximately 0.3 μm). Arrowhead in A indicates a cell undergoing mitosis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Translocation of 5-LO in AMs and PMNsHaving determined that 5-LO is translocated from soluble pools within the cytosol and nucleus to the NE in RBL cells, similar experiments were performed using AMs and PMNs. As in RBL cells, 5-LO in resting AMs was found to occur in both cytosolic and nuclear soluble pools (Fig. 4A). However, when AMs were stimulated, the cytosolic pool did not translocate, whereas most of the nuclear soluble pool moved to the nuclear pellet. Also as in RBL cells, FLAP protein was detected in both the membrane and nuclear pellet from resting AMs; this pattern, likewise, was unaffected by cell activation. Consistent with previous reports(11Woods J. Evans J. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P. Hearn L. Charleson S. Heibein J. Singer I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), 5-LO in human PMNs translocated from the cytosol to the nuclear pellet upon cell activation, and thus co-localized with FLAP (Fig. 4B).Figure 4:Presence of 5-LO and FLAP in subcellular fractions from resting and activated AMs (A) and PMNs (B). Representative immunoblots of cytosolic (C), membrane (M), nuclear soluble (Ns), and nuclear pelletable (Np) fractions, probed for 5-LO (upper) or FLAP (lower). Cells were activated with 1 μM A23187 (15 min, 37°C), and fractions prepared as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunofluorescent microscopy confirmed that 5-LO translocated to the NE upon cell activation in both AMs and PMNs. Resting AMs showed the same pattern of 5-LO distribution as RBL cells: diffuse cytosolic staining combined with granular nuclear staining (Fig. 5A). Following activation, the nuclear 5-LO rapidly dispersed in over 90% of all cells, as had been observed in RBL cells; however, unlike RBL cells, cytosolic 5-LO did not change (Fig. 5B). The image presented in Fig. 5B was selected because it contains two cells which stain exactly like resting AMs and thus can be compared with the single activated cell to demonstrate that there is no change in the cytosolic 5-LO pool. With longer incubations, the dispersed 5-LO within the nucleus moved to the NE (Fig. 5C), resulting in a pattern of distribution similar to that seen for FLAP (Fig. 5D). In PMNs, 5-LO moved from the cytosol in resting cells (Fig. 5E) to the NE of the multilobed nucleus following cell activation (Fig. 5F), again co-localizing with FLAP (Fig. 5G).Figure 5:Localization of 5-LO and FLAP in resting and activated AMs and PMNs by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy. Slide-mounted AMs (A-D) and PMNs (E-G) were incubated in medium alone (A, D, E, and G) or activated (1 μM A23187) for 10 s (B) or 10 min (C and F), then fixed and stained for 5-LO (A-C, E, and F) or FLAP (D and G). All images are from representative fields, except in B, where two atypical cells, demonstrating a staining pattern for 5-LO that matched that seen in resting cells, are close to the typical activated cell, so that the lack of change in cytosolic 5-LO following activation can be appreciated. Bar corresponds to 50 μm for all micrographs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell-free 5-LO Activity of Cytosolic and Nuclear Soluble FractionsTo demonstrate functional capacity of these various 5-LO pools, soluble fractions from both the cytosol and the nucleus were tested for their ability to metabolize arachidonate in a cell-free assay. Both cytosolic and nuclear soluble fractions from RBL cells were capable of converting arachidonate to products which co-elute with LTs (LTA4 metabolites/LTB4) and 5-HETE (Fig. 6). Generation of these products was effectively blocked by zileuton, a specific 5-LO inhibitor, while the amount of unmetabolized arachidonic acid increased. The specific FLAP inhibitor MK-886 did not block product formation by either fraction in the cell-free 5-LO assay. In parallel studies, both pools in AMs also were found to demonstrate zileuton-inhibitable 5-LO activity in the cell-free assay (Table 1). As expected, the cytosolic pool, but not the nuclear pool, of PMNs had significant 5-LO activity.Figure 6:Cell-free 5-LO activity of cytosolic and nuclear fractions from RBL cells and inhibition by zileuton. Presented are representative HPLC elution profiles of radiolabeled products generated from [3H]arachidonic acid by cytosol (upper panel) or nuclear soluble proteins (lower panel), without (filled circles) or with 3 μM zileuton (open circles).

Here, stretch enhancement of release was suppressed by peptides containing the sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), which blocks integrin binding. Integrin antibodies also inhibited the enhancement obtained by stretching. Stretch enhancement depended on intraterminal calcium derived both from external calcium and from internal stores. Muscle stretch thus might enhance the release of neurotransmitters either by elevating internal calcium concentrations or by increasing the sensitivity of transmitter release to calcium in the nerve terminal."

Although the expression of CD69 can be induced in vitro on cells of most hematopoietic lineages with a wide variety of stimuli, in vivo it is mainly expressed by T-lymphocytes located in the inflammatory infiltrates of several human diseases. To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the constitutive and inducible expression of CD69 by leukocytes, we isolated the promoter region of the CD69 gene and carried out its functional characterization. Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the CD69 gene revealed the presence of a potential TATA element 30 base pairs upstream of the major transcription initiation site and several putative binding sequences for inducible transcription factors (NF-κB, Egr-1, AP-1), which might mediate the inducible expression of this gene. Transient expression of CD69 promoter-based reporter gene constructs in K562 cells indicated that the proximal promoter region spanning positions −78 to +16 contained the cis-acting sequences necessary for basal and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-inducible transcription of the CD69 gene. Removal of the upstream sequences located between positions −78 and −38 resulted in decreased promoter strength and abolished the response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. We also found that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is capable of inducing the surface expression of the CD69 molecule as well as the promoter activity of fusion plasmids that contain 5′-flanking sequences of the CD69 gene, suggesting that this cytokine may regulate in vivo the expression of CD69. In addition, cotransfection experiments demonstrated that the CD69 gene promoter can be activated by the NF-κB/Rel family members c-Rel and RelA. The deletion of the sequence spanning positions −255 to −170 abolished both the response to TNF-α and the transactivation by NF-κB. These results indicate that the NF-κB-binding site located at position −223 is necessary for the TNF-α-induced expression of the CD69 gene. Mobility shift assays showed that the two NF-κB motifs located in the proximal promoter region (positions −223 and −160) bind various NF-κB-related complexes, including the heterodimers p50/RelA and p50/c-Rel and homodimers of p50 (KBF-1) and RelA.

INTRODUCTIONMegakaryocytes originate from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells through a complex process involving commitment of the pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor to megakaryocytic precursor cells and their mitotic amplification. The regulatory system governing megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production is thought to take place in at least two stages, 1) during proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells, leading to the production of megakaryocytes, and 2) during maturation of megakaryocytes which leads to the production of platelets. Megakaryocyte proliferation is thought to be dependent on an essential megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor, and this proliferation can be potentiated in vitro by ancillary megakaryocyte potentiators (Meg-POT) 1The abbreviations used are: Meg-POTmegakaryocyte potentiatorMPFmegakaryocyte potentiating factorPCRpolymerase chain reactionhhumanCHOChinese hamster ovaryFCSfetal calf serumHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisILinterleukin.

Peptide fragments were then separated on a Vydac C18 reverse-phase column, and subjected, with purified MPF, to sequence analysis in an Applied Biosystems model 473A or 476A protein sequencer.cDNA Library (I) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)Total RNA was prepared from HPC-Y5 cells(5Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was further purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Complementary DNA was synthesized by oligo(dT) priming and inserted into λZAPII phage vector (Stratagene). After one round of amplification of the resulting cDNA library (106 independent clones), the DNA was extracted, and an aliquot (500 ng) was subjected to PCR in the presence of 50 pmol of each forward and backward primers and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The DNA was denaturated at 95°C for 7 min, and PCR was carried out for 40 cycles as follows: annealing at 60°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 2 min, and denaturation at 94°C for 1 min. An aliquot (1/20) of the PCR products was subjected to a second PCR with inner primers. The PCR products were separated on polyacrylamide gel, and the desired DNA fragment was excised, purified, and subcloned into a pSP73 vector (Promega) for sequencing.cDNA Library (II) and ScreeningA second HPC-Y5 cDNA library was used for isolating a full-length cDNA. Complementary DNA was synthesized as above(6Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3066) Google Scholar), inserted into the UniZAP XR directional cloning vector (Stratagene), and packaged into λ phage using Gigapack Gold (Stratagene), thus yielding 1.8 × 106 independent clones.In order to isolate a full-length hMPF cDNA, approximately 1.7 × 106 clones were screened with Q197A(7Benton W.D. Davis R.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar), a 197-base pair MPF cDNA fragment generated by PCR. This fragment was labeled by 32P using a Random Primer Labeling kit (TAKARA) in the presence of QS and AA primers instead of the kit's random primers, and used as hybridization probe. Filters (Hybond N+, Amersham) were hybridized with the 32P-labeled Q197A probe. Isolated clones were subjected to in vivo excision of pBluescript SK(-) phagemid (Stratagene), and plasmid DNA was prepared by the standard method.DNA SequencingDNA sequences were determined using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide primers.Antibody PreparationThe XhoI fragment of MPF cDNA (nucleotides 181-2109) was excised from pKPO27, and inserted into the StuI site of a pMAL-c Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression vector (New England BioLabs), in which hMPF is expressed as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein. This fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol, and used for immunization. Rabbits or BALB/c mice were immunized five times at 2-week intervals with rhMPF emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. Rabbit anti-MPF plasma was collected 10 days after the final injection. Mouse splenocytes were isolated 9 days after the final injection, and fused to P3U1 mouse myeloma cells to establish hybridomas.Expression of hMPF cDNA in COS-7 CellsPlasmid pRVHKPO27f, harboring the MPF cDNA downstream of the human elongation factor 1α (8Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) promoter, was constructed from pKPO27 and HEF-12 h-Gγ1(9Bendig, M. M., Jones, S. T., Saldanha, J. W., Sato, K., Tsuchiya, M., Sato, K., (April 24, 1992) International Patent Application WO 92-19759.Google Scholar), which includes the simian virus 40 (SV40) origin site. The plasmid (10 μg) was introduced by electroporation (1900 V, 25 microfarads, Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) into COS-7 cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Transformants were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C under 5% CO2 for 72 h.Establishment of rhMPF-producing CHO Cell line (FKL5F)Plasmid pEFDKPO27f, harboring the mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA downstream of the SV40 early promoter and hMPF cDNA downstream of the elongation factor 1α promoter, was constructed from DHFR-ΔE-RVh(9Bendig, M. M., Jones, S. T., Saldanha, J. W., Sato, K., Tsuchiya, M., Sato, K., (April 24, 1992) International Patent Application WO 92-19759.Google Scholar), pCDM8(10Seed B. Nature. 1987; 329: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), and pKPO27. Dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cells (DXB-11) were cultured in α-minimum essential medium, supplemented with 10% FCS, and transfected with linearized pEFDKPO27f. Transformants were selected in nucleoside-free minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS, and the introduced genes were amplified by stepwise addition of methotrexate (Sigma). Human MPF concentration in the culture supernatant of the transfected CHO (FKL5F) cells was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FKL5F cells which exhibited the highest productivity were propagated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10 nM methotrexate and 2% FCS.Purification of rhMPF Produced in CHO CellsFor the purification of 33-kDa MPF, the cell culture supernatant (10 liters) was filtrated through a 5-μm membrane (Amicon, Inc.) to remove cellular debris. The filtrate was then applied to a Blue Sepharose Fast Flow column (5 × 20 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 M NaCl and 0.01% Tween 20. The column was washed with the same buffer, and proteins were eluted with 2 M KCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 0.01% Tween 20. The eluate was desalted by repeated concentrations and dilutions, the resulting concentrate centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant was applied to an S-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5 × 12 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.01% Tween 20. The column was washed with the same buffer, and proteins were eluted stepwise with a NaCl gradient (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 M) in equilibration buffer. The fraction containing MPF was applied to a reverse-phase HPLC column (C4, 20 × 250 mm, Vydac) equilibrated with 24% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was washed with the same solvent, and proteins were eluted with a 24-48% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 48 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. MPF fractions were pooled and applied to a TSKgel G3000SW column (21.5 × 600 mm, TOSOH) equilibrated with 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the column was developed with the same solvent at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The MPF fraction was applied to a reverse-phase HPLC column (10 × 250 mm, Vydac) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and MPF was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile as described above.For 30-kDa MPF purification, the cell culture supernatant was filtrated, concentrated, and MPF was precipitated at 4°C with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 M ammonium sulfate, and applied to a Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. MPF was eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% Tween 20. The 30-kDa MPF was further purified by a combination of reverse-phase HPLC and TSK G3000SW gel permeation chromatography as described above. Fractions containing MPF were identified by Western blotting at each step of the purification.C-terminal Amino Acid SequencePurified recombinant MPF was cleaved with cyanogen bromide. C-terminal peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm). The large C-terminal peptide was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N (Boehringer Mannheim), and the resulting peptides were fractionated as described above.Northern (RNA) Blot AnalysisHuman Multiple Tissue Northern blot was obtained from Clontech and membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled MPF cDNA.Megakaryocyte Colony-forming AssayUnfractionated bone marrow cells (2 × 105) from C57BL/6N mice were cultured in 1 ml of modified McCoy's 5A medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% horse serum (Biocell) and containing 0.3% agar, according to the method of Metcalf(11Metcalf D. MacDonald H.R. Odartchenko N. Sordat B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The number of megakaryocyte colonies formed after 6 days of culture in the presence of 1 ng/ml mouse recombinant IL-3 was determined by acetylcholine esterase staining of the dehydrated culture. Colonies containing more than 4 cells were scored.RESULTSProtein Sequencing of Natural MPFThe N-terminal amino acid sequence of natural MPF purified from HPC-Y5 culture supernatant was determined to be Leu-Ala-Gly-Glu-Thr-Gly-Gln-Glu-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-Asp-Gly-Val-Leu-Ala-Asn as previously reported(4Yamaguchi N. Hattori K. Oh-eda M. Kojima T. Imai N. Ochi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 805-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified natural MPF was partially digested with endoproteinase Glu-C, to obtain large fragments for the determination of the MPF internal amino acid sequences. One of the amino acid sequences of the fragments was Ala-Gln-LysAsn-Val-Lys-Leu-Ser-Thr-Glu-Gln-Leu-Arg-Cys-Leu-Ala-HisArg-Leu-Ser-Glu-Pro-Pro-Glu-Asp-Leu-Asp-Ala.Isolation of MPF cDNA ClonesThree relatively low degenerated oligonucleotides (N1, K4S, and K4A) corresponding to the underlined amino acid sequences shown above were synthesized as shown in Fig. 1 and used as primers for PCR amplification of a MPF cDNA segment. A fragment of the expected size (84 base pairs) was obtained from the HPC-Y5 cDNA library after 2 rounds of PCR amplification, as described in Fig. 1A, first in the presence of T7 promoter sequence and N1 primer, then in the presence of the inner primers K4S and K4A. The sequence of this fragment subcloned in pSP73 vector was 5′-CTCTCAACAGAGCAGCTGCGCTGTCTGGCTCACCGGCTCTCTGA-3′ (not including the primers). The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by this PCR-amplified fragment and that of the peptide obtained by endopeptidase Glu-C digestion were found to be identical. Using four synthetic primers on the basis of this sequence information, a 197-base pair fragment Q197A was generated by repeated PCR amplification, as shown in Fig. 1A. Its nucleotide sequence was found to encode the amino acid sequence of a part of MPF, demonstrating that Q197A is a fragment of MPF cDNA.Twenty-three positive clones were isolated from the cDNA library (II) (1.7 × 106) by plaque hybridization using the Q197A fragment as a probe. One of them, clone pKPO27, was subjected to further analysis, since it contained the longest insert.Structure of MPF cDNAFig. 2 shows the entire nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert of pKPO27. To confirm this sequence, another positive clone pKPO32 was analyzed, and no difference was found in the overlapping cDNA regions of pKPO27 and pKPO32. The cDNA contains a single long open reading frame of 1869 nucleotides, with a potential polyadenylation sequence AGTAAA just upstream of the poly(A) tail. Structure analysis showed that the first ATG conforms well to the Kozak consensus sequence for an initiator methionine, and that the N-terminal amino acid of MPF, Leu, which is followed by Ala, Gly, Gln, and Thr(4Yamaguchi N. Hattori K. Oh-eda M. Kojima T. Imai N. Ochi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 805-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was located at nucleotides 191-193. This cDNA encodes a 622-amino acid long precursor, whose N-terminal 33 hydrophobic amino acids correspond to a peptide signal sequence. The remaining portion of this precursor has a deduced molecular mass of 66.8 kDa, which is different from the molecular size of natural MPF, i.e. 32 kDa. However, when an in vitro translation reaction was performed on RNA templates, transcribed in vitro from a vector harboring MPF cDNA downstream of the T7 promoter, the molecular weight of the in vitro translation product was equivalent to that predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the MPF cDNA (data not shown). A dibasic proteolytic cleavage site RXRXRR and four potential N-glycosylation sites were found in the MPF precursor amino acid sequence. No significant homology to any sequences in GenBank and EMBL was revealed by comparison of nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences.Figure 2:cDNA structure and deduced amino acid sequence of MPF precursor. The nucleotide sequence of pKPO27 cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown. The numbering of nucleotides in the cDNA is indicated at the end of each line. The predicted amino acid sequence of pre-proMPF is numbered by designating the first methionine as 1. The four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr, X, any amino acid except for Pro) are indicated by N-CHO. A potential polyadenylation signal is dot underlined in the 3′-untranslated region. The bold underlined Arg-X-Arg-X-Arg-Arg precedes the potential proteolytic cleavage site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)COS Cell Expression of MPF cDNATo further verify the identity of the MPF cDNA, an expression plasmid pRVHKPO27f was constructed and transfected into COS-7 cells, and the culture supernatant was subjected to megakaryocyte colony-forming assay. The assay was performed in the presence of anti-mouse IL-6 receptor antibody, since the culture supernatant of COS cells contains IL-6. The culture supernatant of cDNA-transfected COS cells, but not that of cells transfected with the vector alone, potentiated megakaryocyte-colony formation. Western blotting analysis was performed on the aforementioned supernatants using an antiserum raised against rMPF expressed in E. coli. In the case of cDNA-transfected cells, a band corresponding to MPF protein was detected at approximately 33 kDa as shown in Fig. 3. Since the 55-kDa band, detected in both cases, is also present in FCS, it was presumably not related to rMPF (data not shown).Figure 3:Detection of MPF in a culture supernatant of transfected COS cells. The culture supernatant of cDNA-transfected COS cells was concentrated by Centriprep-10 (Amicon), electrophoresed on a 12% gel (120 V, 2 h), and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane.

The molecular species of the MPF protein produced in these cells were examined by Western blotting, and two bands of different molecular size, 33 and 30 kDa, were detected in the culture supernatant. In contrast, HPC-Y5 cells and cDNA-transfected COS cells expressed only the 33-kDa form.Purification and Characterization of rMPF Produced in CHO CellsEach of the two purified forms appeared as a single band under both nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE conditions (Fig. 4). To clarify the difference in their molecular weight, their N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences were analyzed. Both forms had the same N-terminal amino acids, i.e. Ser1, Leu4, and Gly6.Figure 4:SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified recombinant MPF. The two MPF forms (100 ng) were electrophoresed on a 12% gel (120 V, 2 h) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.

The amino acid sequence of the C-terminal peptide derived from the 30-kDa MPF was determined as Met-Asp-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gly-Leu-Leu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Gln-Pro-Ile-Ile-Arg261.The C-terminal peptide obtained from the 33-kDa MPF by cyanogen bromide cleavage was further digested with endoproteinase Asp-N, since this peptide was too long to determine the complete amino acid sequence. The peaks obtained by reverse phase HPLC were analyzed in a protein sequencer, and their amino acid sequences, Met-Asp-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gly-Leu-Leu-ProVal-Leu-Gly-Gln-Pro-Ile-Ile-Arg-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln-Gly-Ile-ValAla-Ala-Trp-Arg-Gln-Arg-Ser-Ser-Arg277 and Asp-Pro-Ser-Trp-Arg-Gln-Pro-Glu-Arg286 were identified. These results demonstrated that the 30-kDa rMPF was generated by truncation of the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues from the 33-kDa rMPF.Activity of Recombinant MPFsThe Meg-POT activity of the rMPFs was determined by megakaryocyte colony-forming assay, in comparison with native MPF derived from HPC-Y5 as a positive control. The 33-kDa rMPF potentiated megakaryocyte-colony formation in the presence of mouse IL-3 in a dose dependent manner, as did native MPF (Fig. 5). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6, the 30-kDa rMPF showed no Meg-POT activity in the dose range of 0.156 to 40 ng/ml.Figure 5:Megakaryocyte potentiating activities of natural and recombinant MPFs.

Thus, deletion of the C-terminal 25 amino acids from the 33-kDa rMPF decreased the antigenicity of the protein for these antibodies.Figure 7:Immunological activities of 30- and 33-kDa rMPFs. Two molecular species of MPF samples were incubated in a 96-well plate coated with mouse anti-MPF monoclonal antibody against MPF.

MPF mRNA was detected in HPC-Y5 cells, with an approximate molecular size of 2.4 kilobases and a low expression level, which was in agreement with the low content of MPF in the culture supernatant of HPC-Y5 cells. We also examined the expression of the MPF gene in various human tissues, and the 2.4-kilobase band was detected only in lung. With a long exposure, MPF mRNA could be detected in heart, placenta, and kidney in lower level than in lung, but not in any other tissues so far examined, i.e. brain, liver, skeletal muscle, or pancreas (Fig. 8).Figure 8:MPF mRNA distribution in human tissues.

By structural analysis of the cDNA, the primary translation product of MPF was shown to consist of 622 amino acid residues. The sequence of the mature MPF protein (33 kDa) starts at Ser34 and ends at Arg286 in complete agreement with that of natural MPF(4Yamaguchi N. Hattori K. Oh-eda M. Kojima T. Imai N. Ochi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 805-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the C-terminal Arg residue of the mature 33-kDa MPF is followed by a 336-amino acid polypeptide. Several polypeptide hormones are synthesized as large precursor proteins, such as human pro-parathyroid hormone related protein(12Suva I.J. Winslow G.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. Hammonds R.G. Moseley J.M. Diefenbach-Jagger H. Rodda C.P. Kemp B.E. Rodriguez H. Chen E.Y. Hudson P.J. Martin T.J. Wood W.I.

In each of these cases, active polypeptide sequences are usually bonded by pairs of basic amino acid residues such as Arg-Arg or Lys-Arg, and it is at these sites that proteolytic processing occurs. Watanabe et al.(17Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the sequence Arg-X-Arg/Lys-X-Lys/Arg-Arg is a signal for precursor cleavage catalyzed with furin, a mammalian homologue of the yeast precursor-processing endoprotease Kex2, within the constitutive secretory pathway in nonendocrine cells. The sequence Arg290-Pro-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg295 deduced from the MPF cDNA matches this cleavage signal model. The C-terminal Arg residues of the 33- and 30-kDa rMPFs, Arg286, and Arg261, are located 9 and 34 amino acid residues upstream of this cleavage signal, respectively. Moreover, the hydrophobicity profile predicts that the signal is located in a hydrophilic region between Trp271 and Glu310. This suggests that the MPF precursor would fold and then, be successively processed with furin-like and trypsin-like proteases. A similar processing has been found in leukocyte-derived natural interferon-α (19Levy W.P. Rubinstein M. Shively J. DelValle U. Lai C.-Y. Moschera J. Brink L. Gerber L. Stein S. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6186-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and interferon-γ(20Pan Y.C. Stern A.S. Familletti P.C. Khan F.R. Chizzonite R. Eur. J.

Although cleavage of the precursor gives rise to the mature MPF, it is not known if other peptides released from the C-terminal region of the MPF precursor are also biologically active.The 33-kDa rMPF displayed a Meg-POT activity, whereas the 30-kDa rMPF, which was generated by truncation of the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues from the 33-kDa rMPF, possessed no Meg-POT activity equivalent to that of natural hMPF and IL-6. Furthermore, the 30-kDa rMPF was not antigenic for any of the antibodies raised against the rMPF precursor protein produced in E. coli, although the 30- and 33-kDa forms of rMPF are detectable in Western blotting analysis with these antibodies. Therefore, the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues are not epitopes. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis showed no influence of C-terminal truncation on the secondary structure, that is, there are no significant differences between the CD spectra of the 33- and 30-kDa rMPFs. 2M. Oh-eda, K. Hattori, and T. Kojima, unpublished data. However, Hattori et al. (22Hattori M. Ametani A. Katakura Y. Shimizu M. Kaminogawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22414-22419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that monoclonal antibodies can detect subtle conformational changes in local areas within a protein molecule during denaturation, by determining affinity changes. Shortle and Meeker (23Shortle D. Meeker A.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) have also found that removal of the C-terminal 13 amino acids of staphylococcal nuclease is sufficient to destabilize the protein native state or stabilize it in the denatured state. Therefore, loss of the C-terminal 25 amino acids might give rise to a local conformational change, altering the antigenicity of MPF.Slodowski et al. (24Slodowski O. Bohm J. Schone B. Otto B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have previously examined the biological function of the C-terminal 20 amino acid residues of IFN-γ. The antiviral activities of the INF-γ analogue proteins lacking 14 (C-14) or more amino acids from the C-terminal are less than 2% of the native protein activity. In contrast, a variant, shortened by 11 only amino acids (C-11), showed a higher biological activity than the wild type INF-γ. CD analysis showed no influence of these C-terminal truncations on the secondary structure. In the case of 33-kDa MPF, however, removal of the Arg262-Arg286 region leads to a drastic loss in biological activity and antigenicity, while truncation at Arg286, excising the 33-kDa rMPF from its precursor, may result in a significant increase in activity. The loss of biological activity of the 33-kDa rMPF due to the absence of its C-terminal peptide may be linked to the delicate regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis in vivo. It remains to be determined whether MPF exists in vivo as a precursor of the shorter species, 33- and 30-kDa MPF.MPF was originally isolated from a pancreatic cancer cell line, HPC-Y5, however, Northern blot analysis shows that the MPF gene is expressed in the lung, not in the pancreas. Since the structure of the lung consist of aloveoli and abundant capillaries, and is fraught with the danger of bleeding, this would suggest that MPF might play a role in the growth of megakaryocytes and/or the regulation of platelet production. But since MPF is weakly expressed in heart, placenta, and kidney, MPF may exhibit other biological activities. INTRODUCTIONMegakaryocytes originate from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells through a complex process involving commitment of the pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor to megakaryocytic precursor cells and their mitotic amplification. The regulatory system governing megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production is thought to take place in at least two stages, 1) during proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells, leading to the production of megakaryocytes, and 2) during maturation of megakaryocytes which leads to the production of platelets. Megakaryocyte proliferation is thought to be dependent on an essential megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor, and this proliferation can be potentiated in vitro by ancillary megakaryocyte potentiators (Meg-POT) 1The abbreviations used are: Meg-POTmegakaryocyte potentiatorMPFmegakaryocyte potentiating factorPCRpolymerase chain reactionhhumanCHOChinese hamster ovaryFCSfetal calf serumHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisILinterleukin.

https://openalex.org/W1997154545,"A key assumption of most models for calmodulin regulation of smooth and non-muscle contractility is that calmodulin is freely diffusible at resting intracellular concentrations of free Ca2+. However, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements of three different fluorescent analogs of calmodulin in cultured bovine tracheal smooth muscle cells suggest that free calmodulin may be limiting in unstimulated cells. Thirty-seven % of microinjected calmodulin is immobile by FRAP and the fastest recovering component has an effective diffusion coefficient 7-fold slower than a dextran of equivalent size. Combining the FRAP data with extraction data reported in a previous paper (Tansey, M., Luby-Phelps, K., Kamm, K. E., and Stull, J. T.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9912-9920), we estimate that at most 5% of total endogenous calmodulin in resting smooth muscle cells is unbound (freely diffusible). Examination of the Ca2+ dependence of calmodulin mobility in permeabilized cells reveals that binding persists even at intracellular Ca2+ concentrations as low as 17 nM. When Ca2+ is elevated to between 450 nM and 3 μM, some of the bound calmodulin is released, as indicated by an increase in the effective diffusion coefficient and the percent mobile fraction. At higher Ca2+, calmodulin becomes increasingly immobilized. In about 50% of the cell population, clamping Ca2+ at micromolar levels results in translocation of cytoplasmic calmodulin to the nucleus. The compartmentalization and complex dynamics of calmodulin in living smooth muscle cells have profound implications for understanding how calmodulin regulates contractility in response to extracellular signals."

Transcription of the gene encoding FPP synthase, like those encoding the LDL receptor, HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase, is regulated by the cholesterol status of the cell; transcription is high in cells deprived of sterols and low in cells exposed to excess sterols(4Spear D.H.

The detailed mechanisms involved in the co-ordinate regulation of all these genes by sterols have not yet been established. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the promoters of HMG-CoA synthase and the LDL receptor contain a 10-bp sterol regulatory element (SRE-1) which functions as a binding site for a family of positive transcription factors termed SRE-binding proteins (SREBP)(7Hua X.

Osborne et al. recently demonstrated that a distinct protein, Red 25, is involved in sterol-dependent regulation of the HMG-CoA reductase gene through interaction with a sequence that partially overlaps an SRE-1 (11Osborne T.F. Bennet M. Rhee K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18973-18982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a reporter gene driven by 117 bp of the FPP synthase promoter is regulated 25-fold in response to sterols, even though there are no nucleotide sequences with high homology to either the SRE-1 or the Red 25 binding sites(5Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recently we reported that mutagenesis of the 6-base pair sequence ATTGGC (an inverted CCAAT box) in the rat FPP synthase promoter impaired sterol-dependent transcription of this gene(5Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current report we have used gel shifts and gel supershift assays to identify the protein that binds to the inverted CCAAT box present in the promoters of both FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase. The physiological importance of this transcription factor, namely NF-Y, in the sterol-dependent transcription of both FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase was confirmed in vivo following transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding a dominant negative form of NF-YA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

Where indicated, 0.2 μg antibody to a specific CCAAT box-binding protein was then added, and the incubation continued for 30 min at 4°C prior to electrophoresis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMutagenesis of the 6-base pair sequence ATTGGC in the FPP synthase promoter disrupted sterol-dependent transcription of reporter CAT or luciferase genes(4Spear D.H. Kutsunai S.K. Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14462-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription factor that bound to this site was not identified. Fig. 1A demonstrates that single point mutations at A, T, T, G, or G within FPP synthase promoter-reporter genes stably transfected into CHO cells resulted in the loss of sterol-dependent transcription equivalent to that seen when all 6 bp were mutated; the fold regulation declined from 4-fold to less than 1.5-fold. Mutation of the sixth nucleotide (C → A) resulted in intermediate regulation (Fig. 1A). While mutagenesis of the inverted CCAAT box of many other genes results in a drastic decline in basal transcriptional rates(17Goldsmith M.E. Madden M.J. Morrow C.S. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5856-5860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no such effect was observed for FPP synthase (5Spear D.H. Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25212-25218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). 2S. M. Jackson, J. Ericsson and P. A. Edwards, unpublished observation. A number of distinct transcription factors have been identified that bind to an inverted CCAAT box or to related sequences(18Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In order to identify the specific protein that binds to the ATTGGC sequence in the FPP synthase promoter, a 27-bp radiolabeled oligonucleotide was used in electromobility shift assays. Incubation of this probe with nuclear proteins produced two shifted complexes, which were competed by either excess unlabeled wild-type probe or a probe containing a mutation in the sixth nucleotide (C → A) (Fig. 1B). Probes containing point mutations at A, T, T, G, or G were ineffective or poor competitors (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C demonstrates that the complex obtained with the wild-type probe was supershifted by antibodies that recognize specific subunits of NF-Y but not by antibodies that recognize CBF-HSP(19Lum L.S.Y. Hsu S. Vaewhongs M. Wu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a distinct CCAAT box-binding protein; anti-NF-YA and anti-CBF-A recognize two distinct monomers, termed NF-YA and NF-YB, respectively, in humans, which form a CCAAT box binding multimer(16Mantovani R.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A similar supershift result was obtained using a 100-bp radiolabeled probe of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter containing two SRE-1 sequences and an inverted CCAAT box (Fig. 1D). Preliminary results indicate that mutation of the A in the ATTGGC sequence of an HMG-CoA synthase promoterreporter plasmid (pSYN SRE) disrupts sterol-dependent regulation. 3S. Vallett and T. F. Osborne, unpublished observation. Taken together, the results in Fig. 1 indicate that NF-Y binds to the inverted CCAAT box in the FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase promoters in vitro. Moreover, the same nucleotides that are important for this interaction are also required for sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation in vivo.NF-Y is a ubiquitously expressed multi-component factor that is required for activation of several genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion(21Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.Y. Knapp A.M. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The observation that, in these cases, NF-Y is not itself the tissue-specific factor indicates that it functions together with an appropriate tissue-specific regulatory protein to establish the correct pattern of expression. In the case of the albumin promoter, NF-Y interacts with the liver enriched factor hepatic nuclear factor-1 (22Tronche F. Rollier A. Sourdive D. Cereghini S. Yani M. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 31-43Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in the case of the major histocompatibility complex II genes, NF-Y functions synergistically with the X-box DNA-binding protein and CIITA, a novel non-DNA-binding protein(23Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar).Mantovani et al. (16Mantovani R. Li X.-Y. Pessara U. van Huisjduijnen R.F.H. Benoist C. Mathis D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that NF-YA29, a dominant negative form of NF-YA in which three amino acids in the DNA binding domain have been mutated, forms a complex with NF-YB. This complex was functionally inactive in an in vitro transcription assay(16Mantovani R. Li X.-Y. Pessara U. van Huisjduijnen R.F.H. Benoist C. Mathis D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine whether NF-Y has a physiological role in sterol-dependent transcription of the FPP synthase and other sterol-regulated genes, we utilized a plasmid encoding this mutant (pNF-YA29) in co-transfection experiments with various reporter genes. Co-transfection of CV-1 cells with pNF-YA29 and either FPP synthase (pFPPS-0.319L) or HMG-CoA synthase (pSYN SRE) reporter genes decreased the maximal induced reporter enzyme levels by over 80% (Fig. 2, A and B, open bars). NF-YA29 expression also significantly decreased the fold regulation of these reporter genes in response to sterols (Fig. 2, A and B). These effects were specific since co-expression of pNF-YA29 with plasmids containing reporter genes under the control of promoters derived from the LDL receptor (pLDL SRE), HMG-CoA reductase (pRed CAT-1), SV40 (KS2CAT), or CMV (CMV-β-galactosidase, pCMVβ-G) had only limited effects on expression or regulation of these reporter genes (Fig. 2, C-F).Figure 2:Dominant negative NF-YA29 inhibits the transcription of specific sterol-regulated genes. Each reporter plasmid (4 μg) was transiently transfected into CV-1 cells together with a β-galactosidase plasmid (2 μg), pNF-YA29 (0.5 μg), and carrier DNA (KSoCAT). Following transfection, the cells were incubated for 20 h in media containing 10% LPDS in the absence or presence of cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol (10 and 1 μg/ml), respectively. The luciferase or CAT activities were normalized for transfection efficiency under inducing (open bar) or repressing (closed bar) conditions. A value of 100% was given to the induced enzyme activity obtained in the absence of pNF-YA29. Reporter genes include: A, pFPPS-0.319L, the FPP synthase promoter-luciferase reporter gene; B, pSYN SRE, the HMG-CoA synthase-luciferase reporter gene; C, pLDL SRE, the LDL receptor promoter-luciferase gene; D, pRed CAT-1, the HMG-CoA reductase-CAT reporter gene; E, KS2CAT contains the CAT gene under the control of the SV40 promoter; F, pCMVβ-G encodes β-galactosidase under the control of the CMV promoter. In F, β-galactosidase activity was determined per microgram of cell protein. Activities of all other reporter genes were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The results are representative of two to three experiments each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data presented in Fig. 2 predict that expression of NF-YA29 in CV-1 cells should result in a decreased concentration of transcriptionally active NF-Y. This prediction is supported by the data shown in Fig. 3. The amount of shifted complex obtained with a radiolabeled FPP synthase probe containing ATTGGC was decreased significantly when the nuclear extract was obtained from cells transiently transfected with NF-YA29 as compared to non-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus lane 3). This decrease was specific since the complex obtained with a probe recognized by the ubiquitous transcription factor Oct-1 was unaffected by prior transfection of the cells with pNF-YA29 (Fig. 3B, lane 5 versus lane 6). These results demonstrate that the amount of transcriptionally active nuclear NF-Y available to bind to the ATTGG sequence is decreased following NF-YA29 transfection even under transient transfection conditions where all cells do not contain the mutant NF-YA29 protein. The observed decrease in functional nuclear NF-Y levels is consistent with both the impaired regulation of reporter genes under the control of FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase promoters (Fig. 2) and with the finding of Mantovani et al. that the mutant NF-YA29 subunit can sequester NF-YB into defective complexes(16Mantovani R.

The positions of the free probe (F) and the complexes containing NF-Y and Oct-1 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, the results in Figure 2:, Figure 3: are consistent with a functional role for NF-Y in the sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation of both the FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase genes.The sterol-dependent regulation of HMG-CoA synthase is known to require SREBP(7Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The results presented above indicate that NF-Y also has a role in this regulation. We hypothesize that sterol-mediated regulation may depend on a functional interaction of NF-Y with either SREBP or a related transcription factor since this would provide sterol-mediated specificity. If this hypothesis is valid, introduction of NF-YA29, the dominant negative form of NF-YA, into cells would be expected to interfere with sterol-dependent regulation of genes requiring both NF-Y and SREBP even in the presence of excess SREBP.In order to test this hypothesis, we have utilized an expression plasmid that encodes a 68-kDa transcriptionally active fragment of SREBP under the control of a CMV promoter. Overexpression of this SREBP fragment induces the transcription of HMG-CoA synthase in a sterol-independent manner (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6 versus 1 and 2) consistent with the studies of Hua et al.(7Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). As expected, NF-YA29 co-expression blocked the induction of the HMG-CoA synthase reporter gene, which is normally observed in cells incubated in media deprived of sterols (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4 versus 1 and 2). In addition, the induction mediated by the 68-kDa fragment of SREBP, which was observed in the absence or presence of sterols, was also blocked by NF-YA29 co-expression (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8 versus 5 and 6). We conclude that expressed NF-YA29 has a direct inhibitory effect on the transcription of the HMG-CoA synthase gene as a result of the formation of functionally inactive NF-Y within the nucleus. We propose that a similar mechanism accounts for the effect of the dominant negative NF-YA29 on the transcription of FPP synthase promoter-reporter genes in vivo (Fig. 2).Figure 4:NF-YA29 expression has a direct inhibitory effect on the transcription of HMG-CoA synthase. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with pSYN SRE (4 μg), β-galactosidase (2 μg), and plasmids encoding SREBP (20 ng) or NF-YA29 (1 μg) as indicated. The cells were incubated for 20 h in media containing 10% LPDS in the absence(-) or presence (+) of sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol). The luciferase activity obtained from cells incubated in the absence of sterols, SREBP (pCMV-CSA10), and pNF-YA29 was given a value of 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results are consistent with a novel physiological role for NF-Y in sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation of the FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase genes. The observation that the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y is important for sterol-dependent regulation of FPP synthase suggests that a separate DNA sequence and transcription factor provides additional specificity.The current studies demonstrate that NF-Y participates in a nutritional regulatory response for at least two sterol-regulated genes. It is not the regulatory protein itself, but it is essential for optimal activation. As such, its role may be similar to that of the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 in sterol-dependent regulation of the LDL receptor gene(14Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

In these latter studies, DNA-bound SREBP promoted the binding of Sp1 to an adjacent site and resulted in transcriptional activation of the LDL receptor gene(14Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J.

INTRODUCTIONTopoisomerase II is the cellular target for some of the most active agents currently used for the treatment of human cancers(1Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res.

These drugs, which include etoposide, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone, elicit their antineoplastic effects by a mechanism that is markedly different from that of other enzyme-targeted agents. Rather than acting by inhibiting the catalytic activity of the enzyme, anticancer drugs dramatically increase levels of covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complexes that are normal, but fleeting intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme(1Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Pommier Y. Cancer Chemother.

When present at high concentrations, a portion of these transient enzyme-associated DNA breaks are converted to permanent untethered breaks during replication and transcription (5Zhang H. D'Arpa P.

Thus, these agents act as poisons and convert topoisomerase II, an essential enzyme, into a physiological toxin that produces protein-linked breaks in the genome of treated cells(1Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Pommier Y. Cancer Chemother.

Insertions, deletions, and chromosomal aberrations have been observed in treated cells and animals(8Anderson R.D. Berger N.A. Mutat.

Potter J.D. Robison L.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1678-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Coupled with the fact that topoisomerase II poisons act by exploiting the natural ability of the enzyme to cleave DNA, this finding raises two possibilities. First, there may be cellular factors that induce topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breakage in vivo and trigger DNA recombination, mutagenesis, or cell death pathways. Second, anticancer agents targeted to this enzyme may actually represent exogenous counterparts of these factors.Since anticancer agents presumably act at the topoisomerase II/nucleic acid interface(1Corbett A.H.

Abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites were chosen for this study because they are the most commonly formed endogenous lesion in DNA (~10,000/mammalian cell/day)(16Lindahl T. Nyberg B.

Results indicate that abasic sites are potent enhancers of double-stranded DNA cleavage mediated by Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II. This suggests that abasic sites represent cellular topoisomerase II poisons and implies that anticancer drugs mimic the actions of these endogenous DNA lesions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTopoisomerase II was purified from D. melanogaster embryonic Kc cells as described by Shelton et al.(20Shelton E.R. Osheroff N. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9530-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negatively supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA was prepared as described previously(21Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tris was obtained from Sigma, proteinase K and SDS were from Merck, topoisomerase I was from Life Technologies, Inc., and [γ-32P]ATP (~3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham. Bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V was prepared by the procedure of Lloyd et al.(22Lloyd R.S. Hanawalt P.X. Dodson M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5113-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and was the generous gift of Dr. R. S. Lloyd (The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston). Etoposide was from Sigma and was prepared as a 10 mM drug stock solution in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide prior to use. All other chemicals were analytical reagent grade.Generation of Abasic Sites in DNAAbasic sites were generated in negatively supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA by incubation in 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.8, 250 mM KCl at 70°C as described previously(23Cabral Neto J.B. Gentil A. Caseira Cabral R.E. Sarasin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19718-19723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, at 4°C followed by buffer exchange into 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA in a Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad). The presence of abasic sites was confirmed by the loss of supercoiled DNA following digestion with bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V(22Lloyd R.S. Hanawalt P.X. Dodson M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5113-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The number of abasic sites incorporated was calculated from the equation: number of abasic sites/plasmid = -ln % supercoiled plasmid remaining following digestion. Under the conditions employed, ~1 abasic site/plasmid was produced every 22 min.Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA CleavageCleavage assays were performed as described by Corbett et al.(21Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 nM negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was incubated with 100 nM topoisomerase II in 20 μl of assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2.5% glycerol) at 30°C for 6 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS (1% final concentration) and EDTA (15 mM). Following digestion with proteinase K, DNA products were resolved by electrophoresis in agarose gels. Double-stranded DNA breaks were monitored by the conversion of negatively supercoiled plasmid to linear molecules and were quantified by scanning densitometry as described previously(24Robinson M.J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA ReligationReligation assays were carried out by the procedure of Robinson and Osheroff(25Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cleavage/religation equilibria were established as described in the preceding section. Religation was initiated by shifting the temperature from 30°C to 55°C and stopped at the indicated times by the addition of SDS. The apparent first order rate of religation was determined by quantifying the loss of linear DNA.Topoisomerase II-catalyzed DNA RelaxationReactions were performed as described by Corbett et al.(21Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 20 μl of assay buffer in the presence of 1 mM ATP and 5 nM negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA that contained 0 or 3 abasic sites. Samples were incubated at 30°C for 15 min using catalytic (enzyme:plasmid ≈ 1:3) or stoichiometric (enzyme:plasmid ≈ 1.3:1) amounts of topoisomerase II. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 0.77% SDS, 77 mM EDTA, and the products were resolved by electrophoresis in agarose gels. The percent relaxation was quantified by determining the ATP-dependent loss of the supercoiled DNA band.Hydrolysis of ATP by Topoisomerase IIReactions were performed as described by Corbett et al. (21Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 20 μl of assay buffer in the presence of 4 nM topoisomerase II and 20 nM negatively supercoiled plasmid that contained 0 or 3 abasic sites. Reactions were incubated at 30°C. Two-microliter samples were removed at various intervals up to 15 min and spotted onto thin layer cellulose plates impregnated with polyethyleneimine. Following chromatography in 400 mM NH4HCO3, levels of ATP hydrolysis were monitored by quantifying the release of inorganic phosphate.RESULTSThe presence of abasic sites in pBR322 DNA stimulated double-stranded DNA cleavage mediated by D. melanogaster topoisomerase II (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, inset). Cleavage was increased nearly 4-fold in plasmids that contained a single abasic site (statistical average) and more than 6-fold in plasmids that contained 3 lesions. At 10 nM plasmid/assay, 3 lesions corresponds to an abasic site concentration of 30 nM.Figure 2:Cleavage of DNA containing abasic sites is mediated by topoisomerase II. Data represent the averages of 3 independent experiments. Standard deviations are indicated by error bars. DNA cleavage assays utilized control pBR322 DNA containing 0 abasic sites (None), abasic plasmid containing 3 lesions/molecule (AP), or abasic plasmid with the following modifications: reaction products were not digested with proteinase K (-ProK), samples were treated with 500 mM NaCl (+Salt) or 15 mM EDTA (+EDTA) for 1 min prior to trapping DNA cleavage products with SDS, or reactions were carried out in the absence of Mg2+ (-Mg2+) or topoisomerase II (-Topo II). Inset, an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel of DNA cleavage products is shown. Reactions utilized either control DNA (AP −) or abasic plasmid (AP +) in the presence or absence of topoisomerase II (TII). The positions of negatively supercoiled (FI), nicked (FII), and linear (FIII) plasmid are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All DNA cleavage assays shown were carried out in the absence of ATP and hence represent cleavage/religation equilibria established prior to strand passage(26Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Abasic sites doubled levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. Therefore, these lesions also enhance DNA cleavage that occurs in the ATP-bound form (i.e. post-strand passage conformation) of the enzyme.To contrast the potency of abasic sites with that of a topoisomerase II-targeted anticancer agent, 100 μM etoposide (the most widely prescribed anticancer drug in clinical use(12Smith M.A. Rubinstein L.

Pediatr. Oncol. 1994; 23: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)) was required to produce an equivalent level of DNA cleavage as seen in the presence of 3 lesions/plasmid (Fig. 1, inset). As extrapolated from the concentration of abasic sites required to produce one-half maximal cleavage enhancement (~10 nM abasic sites (Fig. 1) versus >25 μM etoposide(27Osheroff N.

First, cleavage required the presence of both topoisomerase II and Mg2+. Second, the majority of double-stranded breaks were protein-linked (i.e. linear DNA molecules were not released unless samples were digested with proteinase K) and were readily reversed by the addition of salt or by chelation of the required divalent cation by EDTA. These characteristics are hallmarks of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage (29Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 30Osheroff N.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 263-316Google Scholar). A small proportion of double-stranded DNA breaks observed were not protein-associated. This cleavage may reflect the inherent instability of abasic sites (16Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 17Loeb L.A. Preston B.D.

Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Herndon, VA1995Google Scholar) (as evidenced by the enzyme-independent increase in nicked (FII) DNA seen in Fig. 2, inset), which may be exacerbated by exposure to the large number of nucleophilic aminoacyl residues in topoisomerase II(34Wyckoff E. Natalie D. Nolan J.M. Lee M. Hsieh T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Since this later class of breaks may not reflect events mediated by the active-site tyrosine of topoisomerase II, for all experiments shown (other than those in Fig. 2), double-stranded DNA breaks that were not protein-associated (i.e. plasmid molecules that were not digested with proteinase K, but migrated with the electrophoretic mobility of free linear pBR322 DNA) were subtracted as background from the total double-stranded cleavage observed.As determined by electrophoresis in agarose gels containing the intercalating agent, chloroquine, the average linking number of pBR322 was not altered significantly by the presence of 3 abasic sites/plasmid. Therefore, the enhancement of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage by abasic sites was not due to a global change in plasmid topology. Furthermore, abasic sites stimulated cleavage in linear DNA substrates, 1P. S. Kingma and N. Osheroff, unpublished results. indicating that superhelicity is not needed for cleavage enhancement. Finally, the effect of abasic sites appears to be specific for type II topoisomerases, as no cleavage stimulation was observed in the presence of topoisomerase I.Topoisomerase II establishes a DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium within a few seconds when control pBR322 molecules are used as substrates (35Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9538-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). This rapid attainment of equilibrium probably reflects the plethora of potential recognition/cleavage sites that are available to the enzyme in the plasmid. In contrast, cleavage of pBR322 that contained only 3 abasic sites was time-dependent and required 6 min to achieve maximal cleavage (Fig. 3). Beyond 6 min, levels of cleavage remained stable. This indicates that topoisomerase II does not initially bind its DNA substrate at abasic sites and suggests that it locates these lesions by a scanning mechanism. If this is the case, the enzyme may be able to locate isolated abasic sites, even if they are separated by long regions of DNA.Figure 3:Time course of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage.

Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Drugs such as etoposide (Fig. 4) and amsacrine act primarily by inhibiting the ability of topoisomerase II to religate its cleaved DNA substrate. Alternatively, agents such as quinolones, genistein, nitroimidazoles, pyrimidobenzimidazoles, and ellipticine have little effect on religation and presumably act by enhancing the forward rate of cleavage(1Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 36Sorensen B.S. Sinding J. Andersen A.H. Alsner J. Jensen P.B. Westergaard O. J. Mol.

In fact, the religation rate of plasmid molecules containing 3 abasic sites was nearly twice that of control DNA. This finding provides strong evidence that abasic sites enhance nucleic acid breakage primarily by increasing the forward rate of cleavage.Figure 4:Effect of abasic sites on topoisomerase II-mediated religation of cleaved DNA. Data represent the averages of two independent experiments. DNA religation was initiated by shifting the temperature from 30°C to 55°C and was stopped at the indicated times. At time = 0, levels of double-stranded DNA cleavage were set to 100%. Reactions utilized plasmid containing either 0 (None) or 3 abasic sites (Abasic), or 0 abasic sites plus 100 μM etoposide (Etop).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the cytotoxic potential of topoisomerase II poisons reflects their ability to enhance DNA breakage, these agents also inhibit the catalytic strand passage reaction of the enzyme(38Corbett A.H. Hong D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was not the case for DNA containing abasic sites (Fig. 5A). At a catalytic enzyme to plasmid ratio (i.e. ~1:3), topoisomerase II relaxed negatively supercoiled abasic DNA at a rate that was ~25% faster than that of control plasmid. It is notable, however, that catalytic DNA relaxation is limited by the rate at which the enzyme releases its fully relaxed DNA substrate(39Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This slow dissociation rate could potentially mask the stimulatory effects of abasic sites on DNA cleavage or other reaction steps prior to enzyme recycling. Therefore, the experiment was repeated utilizing a stoichiometric ratio of enzyme to plasmid (i.e. ~1.3:1) (Fig. 5B). Under these conditions, which do not require enzyme dissociation, negatively supercoiled substrates containing 3 abasic sites were relaxed with an initial velocity that was ~2.5 times higher than that of control molecules.Figure 5:Stimulation of topoisomerase II-catalyzed relaxation of negatively supercoiled plasmid by abasic sites. Data represent the averages of two independent experiments. Standard deviations are indicated by error bars. In A, reactions were carried out using catalytic levels of topoisomerase II (enzyme:plasmid ≈ 1:3). In B, reactions were carried out using stoichiometric levels of topoisomerase II (enzyme:plasmid ≈ 1.3:1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The enhancement of DNA relaxation by abasic sites is in marked contrast to the inhibitory effects of anticancer drugs, even those that stimulate the forward rate of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage(1Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, in all cases examined, these drugs impaired interactions between topoisomerase II and its ATP cofactor (24Robinson M.J. Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (which is required for DNA strand passage(29Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar)). In contrast, abasic sites did not effect the rate of enzyme-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6). This lack of inhibition may explain why abasic sites, which enhance the forward rate of cleavage, are able to stimulate the catalytic activity of the enzyme.Figure 6:Effect of abasic sites on topoisomerase II-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis.

Previous studies examined the effects of ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (21Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or DNA methylation (40Leteurtre F. Kohlhagen G. Fesen M.R. Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7893-7900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on topoisomerase II activity. Pyrimidine dimers had no effect on DNA cleavage, but rather inhibited overall activity by specifically inhibiting the DNA strand passage step of the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle. Furthermore, methylation suppressed DNA cleavage up to 7 bases from the modified cytosine.Abasic sites are produced in vivo by a myriad of DNA damaging events. Among these are oxidation (including attack by NO produced as part of the macrophage immune response), ionizing radiation, DNA-reactive chemicals (including alkylating agents used for the treatment of human cancers), and spontaneous hydrolysis (17Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 19Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Herndon, VA1995Google Scholar, 33Lloyd R.S. Linn S.M. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed.

Similar to topoisomerase II-targeted agents, these events induce mutagenesis, recombination, and under excessive conditions, trigger pathways that lead to cell death. Due to the rapid removal of abasic sites by the cellular repair machinery(17Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 19Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Herndon, VA1995Google Scholar), physiological interactions with topoisomerase II under normal conditions probably are rare. However, the results of the present study indicate that when these interactions occur, they may lead to the production of protein-associated double-stranded DNA breaks. Furthermore, the potential for these interactions are increased under conditions that induce DNA damage or compromise repair systems(42Ramotar D. Popoff S.C. Gralla E.B. Demple B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).On the basis of the studies presented above, it is proposed that abasic sites are a conduit for numerous cellular insults that ultimately enhance topoisomerase II-mediated double-stranded DNA cleavage. Although DNA scissions produced by this process are transient in nature, they are frequently converted to permanent double-stranded breaks during replication and transcription(5Zhang H. D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 23-27PubMed Google Scholar, 6D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar, 7Howard M.T. Neece S.H. Matson S.W. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12031-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Unlike the readily repaired single-stranded DNA nicks normally produced at abasic sites by the actions of AP endonucleases, lyases, and spontaneous elimination reactions(17Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 19Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Herndon, VA1995Google Scholar), double-stranded breaks are potential hot spots for genomic alterations, chromosomal translocations, and the induction of apoptotic events(8Anderson R.D. Berger N.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 309: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Ferguson L.R. Baguley B.C. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1994; 24: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that anticancer agents targeted to the enzyme exert their mutagenic and antineoplastic effects by utilizing a mechanism that mimics the cleavage-enhancing actions of endogenous DNA lesions, thus allowing these drugs to exploit existing cellular pathways. INTRODUCTIONTopoisomerase II is the cellular target for some of the most active agents currently used for the treatment of human cancers(1Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Pommier Y. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 32: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 3Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). These drugs, which include etoposide, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone, elicit their antineoplastic effects by a mechanism that is markedly different from that of other enzyme-targeted agents. Rather than acting by inhibiting the catalytic activity of the enzyme, anticancer drugs dramatically increase levels of covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complexes that are normal, but fleeting intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme(1Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Pommier Y. Cancer Chemother.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). When present at high concentrations, a portion of these transient enzyme-associated DNA breaks are converted to permanent untethered breaks during replication and transcription (5Zhang H. D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 23-27PubMed Google Scholar, 6D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar, 7Howard M.T. Neece S.H. Matson S.W. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12031-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, these agents act as poisons and convert topoisomerase II, an essential enzyme, into a physiological toxin that produces protein-linked breaks in the genome of treated cells(1Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Pommier Y. Cancer Chemother.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar).Consistent with the ability to generate DNA breaks, topoisomerase II-targeted drugs produce mutagenic side effects. Insertions, deletions, and chromosomal aberrations have been observed in treated cells and animals(8Anderson R.D. Berger N.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 309: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Ferguson L.R. Baguley B.C. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1994; 24: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, levels of sister chromatid exchange and illegitimate recombination are increased significantly(8Anderson R.D. Berger N.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 309: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Ferguson L.R. Baguley B.C. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1994; 24: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Finally, 11q23 chromosomal translocations that produce acute myelogenous leukemia have been reported in patients following treatment with etoposide-based regimens(8Anderson R.D. Berger N.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 309: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 10DeVore R. Whitlock J. Hainsworth T. Johnson D. Ann. Intern.

Potter J.D. Robison L.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1678-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Coupled with the fact that topoisomerase II poisons act by exploiting the natural ability of the enzyme to cleave DNA, this finding raises two possibilities. First, there may be cellular factors that induce topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breakage in vivo and trigger DNA recombination, mutagenesis, or cell death pathways. Second, anticancer agents targeted to this enzyme may actually represent exogenous counterparts of these factors.Since anticancer agents presumably act at the topoisomerase II/nucleic acid interface(1Corbett A.H.

Abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites were chosen for this study because they are the most commonly formed endogenous lesion in DNA (~10,000/mammalian cell/day)(16Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 17Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 18Lindahl T.

Results indicate that abasic sites are potent enhancers of double-stranded DNA cleavage mediated by Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II. This suggests that abasic sites represent cellular topoisomerase II poisons and implies that anticancer drugs mimic the actions of these endogenous DNA lesions."

The ability of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to activate GTP binding to p21ras was investigated using cultured embryonic chick neurons. In both sympathetic and sensory neurons, the addition of NGF markedly increased the formation of Ras-GTP. The magnitude of the effect was found to depend upon the developmental stage, peaking at embryonic day 11 in sympathetic neurons and at embryonic day 9 in sensory neurons, times when large numbers of neurons depend on NGF for survival. Surprisingly, following the addition of BDNF, no formation of Ras-GTP could be observed in neurons cultured with BDNF. When sensory neurons were cultured with NGF alone, both NGF and BDNF stimulated GTP binding to Ras. In rat cerebellar granule cells, while the acute exposure of these cells to BDNF resulted in the formation Ras-GTP, no response was observed following previous exposure of the cells to BDNF, as was observed with sensory neurons. However, this desensitization was not observed in a transformed cell line expressing TrkB. In neurons, the mechanism underlying the loss of the BDNF response appeared to involve a dramatic loss of binding to cell-surface receptors, as determined by cross-linking with radiolabeled BDNF. Receptor degradation could not account for the desensitization since cell lysates from neurons pretreated with BDNF revealed that the levels of TrkB were comparable to those in untreated cells. These results indicate that in neurons, the pathways activated by NGF and BDNF are differentially regulated and that prolonged exposure to BDNF results in the inability of TrkB to bind its ligand.

The formation of the vertebrate nervous system is regulated by the availability of a variety of soluble factors promoting the survival and differentiation of neurons. Among these factors is a family of related proteins referred to as neurotrophins that includes nerve growth factor (NGF), 1The abbreviations used are: NGFnerve growth factorBDNFbrain-derived neurotrophic factorNTneurotrophinDRGdorsal root gangliaEembryonic dayKRHKrebs-Ringer-HEPESPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePCRpolymerase chain reaction. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophins 3-6 (NT-3, NT-4/5, and NT-6). Gene knockout and antibody-mediated deprivation experiments have established the crucial role played by several of these proteins in the formation of the nervous system (for review, see (1Snider W.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar)). The involvement of the Trk subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases in mediating the biological function of the neurotrophins has been demonstrated by the observation that loss-of-function mutations introduced in the genes coding for each of the three Trk receptors cause defects in the nervous system that are analogous to those observed in mice lacking the corresponding receptor ligand (for review, see (2Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar)). While these results do not indicate that the Trk proteins are the only receptor components necessary for mediating a neurotrophin response in neurons, they do show that this subgroup of tyrosine kinases plays a necessary role in mediating neuronal responses to neurotrophins. nerve growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor neurotrophin dorsal root ganglia embryonic day Krebs-Ringer-HEPES phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polymerase chain reaction. Binding of neurotrophins to their respective Trk receptors results in the stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity, which initiates a signaling cascade involving the downstream targets of many growth factor receptors, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C, and, in particular, p21ras (for review, see (3Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar)). The importance of the Ras pathway in neurotrophin signaling was first revealed using the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. The introduction of Ras antibodies or of dominant negative Ras mutants into these tumor cells suppressed NGF-induced fiber outgrowth(4Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). While much less work has been done using post-mitotic neurons, similar results were obtained with embryonic neurons: the introduction of a constitutively active mutant of Ras into chick sensory neurons led to neurotrophin-independent survival and fiber outgrowth(5Borasio G. John J. Wittinghofer A. Barde Y.-A. Sendtner M. Heumann R. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1087-1096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similarly, Fab fragments blocking the activity of Ras prevented NGF-induced survival in these neurons(6Borasio G.D. Markus A. Wittinghofer A. Barde Y.-A. Heumann R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, neurotrophin signaling appears to be differentially regulated depending on the neuronal context: in this same study, the introduction of anti-Ras Fab fragments failed to block the survival effects of NGF in chick (unlike rat(7Nobes C.D. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) sympathetic neurons, and constitutively active Ras was unable to support survival of these neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate that although neurotrophins act like many other growth factors, there appears to be differential regulation of the signal transduction pathways in different neurons. We were interested in investigating the involvement and regulation of the Ras pathway by measuring the formation of Ras-GTP following stimulation by NGF and BDNF of different populations of neurons at various embryonic ages. In confirmation of a recent report, we found that BDNF and NGF were both able to stimulate GTP binding to Ras in chick sensory neurons(8Ng N.F.L. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25329-25333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NGF was also found to activate Ras in sympathetic neurons. Surprisingly, in contrast to the results obtained with NGF, cultured neurons became completely desensitized to BDNF when exposed for prolonged periods of time to BDNF. Recombinant neurotrophins were produced using the vaccinia virus system (BDNF and NT-3(9Götz R. Kolbeck R. Lottspeich F. Barde Y.-A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) or Chinese hamster ovary cells generously provided by Genentech (BDNF and NGF). NGF purified from the submandibular gland of an adult male mouse as described (10Suda K. Barde Y.-A. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4042-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) was also used. Identical results were obtained with neurotrophins from each source. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were isolated from chick embryos at E6, E9, and E12; dissociated with trypsin; and plated as described(11Lindsay R.M. Thoenen H. Barde Y.-A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, the ganglia were treated with 0.1% trypsin for 15 min at 37°C and then dissociated in the medium used to culture the neurons, which was F14 containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (culture medium), by trituration through a siliconized, fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Following a 3-h preplating to remove most of the non-neuronal cells, the neurons were plated on a substrate coated with polyornithine and medium conditioned by RN22 schwannoma cells or laminin. Sympathetic neuronal cultures from embryos at E7, E11, or E15, as indicated, were prepared as described(11Lindsay R.M. Thoenen H. Barde Y.-A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Briefly, lumbosacral chains were isolated, dissociated, and preplated for 2 h and plated on 6-cm dishes coated as described above. Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from P6 rats as described (12Zafra F. Hengerer B. Leibrock J. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Cerebella were dissected and incubated for 20 min at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mM glucose, 1 mg/ml albumin, 10 mg/ml DNase, and 12 units/ml papain. The cells were dissociated by trituration through a plastic pipette, pelleted at 900 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were plated on 6-cm polyornithine-coated dishes, and the medium was changed after 12 h to a serum-free medium with or without BDNF(12Zafra F. Hengerer B. Leibrock J. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3545-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Neurons were plated on 6-cm dishes at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/plate (see above), washed twice with a physiological buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.84 mM Na2HPO4, 0.22 mM KH2PO4, 2.6 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM glucose, 3 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4), and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, followed by a 30-min wash at 37°C in phosphate-free KRH buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml cytochrome c). The cells were then loaded for 4 h at 37°C with 0.25 mCi of 32Pi (Amersham Corp.) in 1.5 ml of KRH buffer. After incubation with or without the indicated neurotrophin for 2 min (unless otherwise indicated), the plates were chilled on ice; washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4; and lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM PMSF, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM orthovanadate). The plates were scraped, and the lysate was rocked for 20 min on ice before the cell debris was separated by a 10-min spin at 14,000 × g. Ras was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13-259. The lysate was washed with a 10% charcoal solution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to remove unbound nucleotides, and the Ras-antibody complex was collected with protein G-Sepharose. After washing twice with lysis buffer and twice with washing buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 20 mM MgCl2), the bound nucleotide was eluted from Ras by heating to 90°C for 3 min in 20 μl/sample of TLC running buffer (0.75 M KH2PO4, pH 3.5). The resulting supernatant was separated on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate (Merck), and the ratio between GDP and GTP was determined using a PhosphorImager (Fuji). Results are presented as the percentage of GTP relative to the sum GTP + GDP. Analysis of the dose-response curve for NGF in sympathetic cultures was done by nonlinear regression using the software package Graphpad™. All data were simultaneously fit to a sigmoidal curve describing dose-response functions according to the following equation: Y = A + (B - A)/(1 + (10X/10C)D), where Y is the percent of GTP binding, X is the logarithm of the ligand concentration, A is the minimum and B is the maximum of the curve, C is the EC50, and D is the slope factor. RNA was isolated from DRG neuronal cultures after 24 or 60 h using the RNazol kit (Cinna-Biotex Lab), which is based on the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The RNA was reverse-transcribed using an antisense oligonucleotide from the tyrosine kinase domain of chick TrkB (5′-GGGCATTGTCACTGGCAT; see (14Dechant G. Biffo S. Okazawa H. Kolbeck R. Pottgiesser J. Barde Y.-A. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 545-558PubMed Google Scholar)) with or without avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for 30 min at 42°C, followed by 1 h at 52°C. A 1-μl aliquot, from a total of 50 μl of the cDNA, was then amplified by PCR using a sense oligonucleotide from the extracellular domain (5′-CTCCGGATGTTTCCAACAAA) and the antisense oligonucleotide described by 25 cycles (30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 54°C, and 45 s at 72°C) in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler. Following separation on a 1% agarose gel, the 488-base pair fragment was transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.) and hybridized with an internal antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GCTGACTGTTGGTAATTC). The oligonucleotide probe was labeled with ATP using polynucleotide kinase, and hybridization was carried out with 3-5 × 105 cpm/ml at 42°C. The membrane was washed twice in 0.5 × SSC, 1% SDS at room temperature and exposed to Fuji x-ray film. BDNF was iodinated according to the method of Dechant et al.(14Dechant G. Biffo S. Okazawa H. Kolbeck R. Pottgiesser J. Barde Y.-A. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 545-558PubMed Google Scholar). Vaccinia-derived mouse BDNF (10 μg) was incubated for 1 h on ice in 40 μl of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.4 μg of lactoperoxidase (Sigma), 50 μM H2O2, and 1.5 mCi of Na2I (100 mCi/ml; Amersham Corp.). The reaction was stopped by dilution to 1 ml with the phosphate buffer, and incorporation of 125I was determined following an overnight incubation at 4°C. Typically, 75-90% of the total radioactivity was incorporated into the protein. Cerebellar granule neurons cultured for 2 days in the absence or presence of 20 ng/ml BDNF were washed as described for the Ras assay and incubated at 4°C in KRH buffer with the addition of 1 mM PMSF and 4 μg/ml leupeptin. Radiolabeled BDNF was added at a concentration of 1 nM with or without 100 nM unlabeled BDNF to measure specific binding. After 2 h, a 1 mM concentration of the cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate was added, and incubation was continued for 20 min. Unreacted reagent was quenched by adding Tris buffer (40 mM, pH 7.4). The plates were rinsed twice with KRH buffer and once with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM PMSF, 4 μg/ml leupeptin). The plates were scraped, and the lysate was incubated for 20 min on ice before the cell debris was separated by a 10-min spin at 14,000 × g. TrkB was immunoprecipitated by an overnight incubation at 4°C with antisera raised to a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the tyrosine kinase domain of human Trk that also immunoprecipitates rat TrkB and TrkC (a kind gift from Dr. Alfredo Rodríguez-Tébar). The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for at least 1 h and then washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with Tris-buffered saline. Equal amounts of sample were separated on 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager. To prepare membranes for cross-linking experiments, granule cells were cultured and washed as described above, removed by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The cells were then disrupted in phosphate-buffered saline with the addition of 1 mM PMSF and 4 μg/ml leupeptin using a glass-Teflon tissue homogenizer for 1 min at 1500 rpm (B. Braun Biotech International), followed by sonication for 10 s on ice (Bronson sonifier). After removal of the nuclei by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the membranes remaining in solution were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h. These membranes were then resuspended in KRH buffer, and radiolabeled BDNF was added and cross-linked as described for intact cells. The membranes were then repelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate them from the free ligand, and TrkB was immunoprecipitated as described above. 20 × 106 cerebellar granule neurons were plated for 2 days with or without BDNF (20 ng/ml) on 10-cm dishes. After washing once with phosphate-buffered saline, they were collected in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF, 250 μMp-nitrophenol phosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM ATP). Lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose 6MB (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed, run on 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), and incubated with anti-TrkB serum that was raised to a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the tyrosine kinase domain of TrkB (residues 794-808) (Santa Cruz) or with an anti-TrkB antiserum raised to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 45-60 in the extracellular domain of TrkB (a generous gift from Dr. David R. Kaplan). Detection was performed after incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody complexed with horseradish peroxidase and the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate solution (Amersham Corp.). Constitutively activated Ras introduced into chick sympathetic neurons does not promote their survival, and antibodies to p21ras do not influence NGF-mediated survival(5Borasio G. John J. Wittinghofer A. Barde Y.-A. Sendtner M. Heumann R. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1087-1096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Borasio G.D. Markus A. Wittinghofer A. Barde Y.-A. Heumann R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the presence of an activable Ras pathway has not been determined in these neurons. To address this question, E11 chick sympathetic neurons were cultured for 2 days with 5 ng/ml NGF. After removal of the factor, the acute addition of NGF induced a robust response to this neurotrophin with an EC50 of 60 ± 1.2 pM (or 1.6 ng/ml) and a maximum stimulation of 52 ± 2% (Fig. 1, lower panel). The response to NGF was found to peak rapidly, followed by a slow decline to a level twice that of control after 60 min (Fig. 1, upper panel). A similar response was also observed for sensory neurons (8Ng N.F.L. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25329-25333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PC12 cells(15Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To determine if neurotrophin activation of the Ras signaling pathway is regulated during development, neurons were isolated from dorsal root ganglia at E6, E9, and E12. Isolated neurons were cultured with a mixture of 5 ng/ml each NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 to maximize survival of all types of neurons. Similarly, sympathetic neurons were prepared from embryos at days 7, 11, and 15, corresponding to stages during which neuronal numbers increase in these ganglia, in which there is extensive neuronal loss, and when cell number has plateaued, respectively(16Leah J. Kidson C. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1988; 6: 403-409Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in 5 ng/ml NGF, except for those of E7, which were cultured without factor as they can survive several days in culture in the absence of neurotrophin(17Ernsberger U. Edgar D. Rohrer H. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Identical responses were observed if the E7 neurons were cultured with 5 ng/ml NT-3 (data not shown). After 2 days in culture, the medium containing the factor(s) was removed, and acute stimulation of Ras was measured. A maximally effective concentration of NGF (1 nM or 26 ng/ml) was able to stimulate GTP binding to Ras in both sensory and sympathetic neurons at all stages examined. The maximal response to NGF varied during development with a peak at E9 in DRG and at E11 in sympathetic neurons and a decreased response in both populations of cells in late development. However, even at the earliest time point, significant stimulation by this neurotrophin was observed (Fig. 2). With sympathetic neurons at E7, NT-3 weakly activated Ras at a stage when these neurons are known to show a survival response to this factor(18Dechant G. Rodríguez-Tébar A. Kolbeck R. Barde Y.-A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2610-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Marginal but significant activation was also observed at E11, a time point at which NT-3, at low concentrations, no longer supports these cells in culture(18Dechant G. Rodríguez-Tébar A. Kolbeck R. Barde Y.-A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2610-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, by E15, there was no significant effect of NT-3 on Ras (Fig. 2). Unlike with NGF and NT-3, BDNF was found not to stimulate the formation of Ras-GTP above control levels in sensory neurons at any stage examined. The reasons for this unexpected observation were then explored. Sensory neurons were cultured for 2 days with 5 ng/ml BDNF alone to select for neurons responsive to this factor. Nevertheless, after washing away the culture medium, acutely added BDNF failed to activate Ras, as was the case when sensory neurons were maintained in culture with a mixture of neurotrophins (see above). In contrast, NGF was very effective in stimulating this pathway in the BDNF-selected neurons (Fig. 3). This result suggested that at least some sensory neurons selected by BDNF must contain functional NGF receptors, a possibility that was directly examined (see below). Conversely, DRG neurons cultured with 0.1 ng/ml NGF showed a small but significant response to BDNF (Fig. 3), in agreement with previous results of Ng and Shooter(8Ng N.F.L. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25329-25333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the formation of Ras-GTP following exposure of neurons to neurotrophins is most likely due to the activation of the corresponding receptor tyrosine kinase, the presence of TrkB mRNA in neurons dependent on NGF for survival was investigated by reverse transcription-PCR using tyrosine kinase-specific primers. Neurons selected with NGF for 24, or even 60 h, were found to contain TrkB message, suggesting a colocalization of TrkA and TrkB (Fig. 4). The presence of TrkB mRNA was also observed following a 24-h exposure of neurons to BDNF. This indicates that the lack of BDNF response is not a consequence of the disappearance of TrkB mRNA. Functional, high affinity BDNF receptors are only present in small numbers in primary sensory neurons of the chick(14Dechant G. Biffo S. Okazawa H. Kolbeck R. Pottgiesser J. Barde Y.-A. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 545-558PubMed Google Scholar), which renders further biochemical analyses difficult. In view of this, cultured rat cerebellar granule cells represent an attractive alternative as these neurons can readily be obtained in large numbers and have large numbers of BDNF-binding sites (33,000) per cell(19Lindholm D. Dechant G. Heisenberg C.-P. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Additionally, while BDNF promotes the survival of a proportion of these cells in long-term cultures, these cells do not depend on BDNF for their survival during the first 3 days in vitro(19Lindholm D. Dechant G. Heisenberg C.-P. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). When BDNF was added to granule cells that had not been cultured with BDNF, the formation of Ras-GTP could readily be observed (Fig. 5). However, exposure of the cells to BDNF for 24 h led to the disappearance of the response to acutely added BDNF (Fig. 5). This result indicates that the desensitization to BDNF observed with chick sensory neurons can also be observed with other TrkB-expressing neurons. Interestingly, this loss of responsiveness is not observed when TrkB is expressed in a non-neuronal context. Incubation of the cell line A293 expressing chick TrkB (14Dechant G. Biffo S. Okazawa H. Kolbeck R. Pottgiesser J. Barde Y.-A. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 545-558PubMed Google Scholar) for 24 h with 20 ng/ml BDNF did not lead to any measurable desensitization when compared with cells acutely exposed to BDNF (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Desensitization of p21ras stimulation by BDNF does not occur in TrkB-transfected fibroblasts. A293 fibroblasts expressing chicken TrkB were cultured for 24 h in the absence (left panel) or presence (right panel) of 20 ng/ml BDNF. The cells were then thoroughly rinsed to remove the culture medium, acutely treated with BDNF (dotted bars) or buffer (open bars), and lysed, and the percent of GTP bound to p21ras was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown are the means ± S.E. of three or more experiments. CON, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the loss of BDNF signaling through Ras, changes in cell-surface receptor availability were assessed in granule cells using radiolabeled BDNF. After cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with a Trk-specific antibody, a radioactive band at ~150 kDa was detected (Fig. 7, lanes A and B), which was absent when incubation was performed in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled BDNF (Fig. 7, lane D). Immunoprecipitates from cells treated for 24 h with BDNF revealed a dramatic decrease in receptor availability, suggesting a loss of receptor binding capability in BDNF-pretreated neurons (Fig. 7, lane C). The cross-linking experiments were repeated using cell membranes isolated by high speed centrifugation to probe for receptors no longer at the cell surface. No detectable levels of 125I-BDNF could be cross-linked to the receptor in membranes isolated from cells pretreated with BDNF (Fig. 7, lanes E and F). To determine if the loss of binding was a result of receptor degradation, cell lysates obtained from either naive or BDNF-treated granule cells were compared for their TrkB receptor content by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using an antiserum specific for the extracellular domain of TrkB. The levels of full-length TrkB observed in neurons incubated for 24 h with BDNF compared with untreated cells were similar (Fig. 8). This result was confirmed using a TrkB antiserum specific for the intracellular domain (data not shown). This finding suggests that although the ability of TrkB to bind BDNF is lost following prolonged exposure of the cells to BDNF, TrkB protein levels in the cell remain similar. To be certain that BDNF from the culture medium was completely removed by the standard washing procedure preceding acute exposure of neurons to the neurotrophins, the naive cells were exposed for 5 min to 20 ng/ml BDNF. This period of time is sufficient for receptor activation, as indicated by the Ras stimulation (Fig. 1, upper panel). After washing, cross-linking with radioiodinated BDNF, and immunoprecipitation, the cross-linked protein band was of the same intensity as for the control cells (Fig. 7, lane B). Thus, following a 5-min exposure of the cells to BDNF at 37°C, the washing procedure is sufficient to render the BDNF receptors fully accessible to binding of the ligand. The loss of the BDNF-induced formation of Ras-GTP in neurons cultured with BDNF raised the question as to how the neurons survived when desensitized to BDNF. To investigate the possibility that BDNF could be removed without immediate effects on neuronal viability, sensory neurons cultured for 2 days in the presence of 5 ng/ml BDNF were thoroughly washed, and medium without serum was added back either with or without BDNF. The neurons were counted after an additional 2 days of culture, and the results were compared with a similar experiment performed with NGF. While only 25.3 ± 3.4% of the NGF-supported neurons were still alive following deprivation of NGF, 80.9 ± 14% of those originally depending on BDNF were still viable. Essentially all neurons were dead under either condition by the 5th day following factor deprivation. Thus, it appeared that while neurons cultured with BDNF were not able to survive long periods after removal of the factor, they were not as immediately dependent on BDNF for their survival when compared with the NGF-dependent neurons. This study shows that cultured sensory and cerebellar neurons respond to the addition of neurotrophins by the formation of Ras-GTP. This response is also observed in sympathetic neurons, where the activation of Ras has been previously shown to be neither sufficient nor necessary for neuronal survival. Unexpectedly, the formation of Ras-GTP in response to BDNF can only be seen when neurons are acutely exposed to BDNF: culturing them in the presence of BDNF leads to the complete disappearance of the response. This phenomenon is not observed with NGF, nor is it observed when the receptor tyrosine kinase for BDNF, TrkB, is expressed in non-neuronal cells. The NGF response seen in sympathetic neurons is very similar to that reported for the PC12 cell line(8Ng N.F.L. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25329-25333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar, 21Li B.-Q. Kaplan D. Kung H. Kamata T. Science. 1992; 256: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It required essentially identical NGF concentrations, which are in the range of the high affinity binding constant(22Sutter A. Riopelle R.J. Harris-Warrick R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5972-5982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was very rapid, peaking at 2 min, followed by a quick decline that plateaued to a level above that measured in nonstimulated cells. A long-lasting activation of Ras has been suggested to be crucial for promoting neural differentiation(15Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, the fact that NGF could activate Ras in these neurons was unexpected since it has previously been shown that inactivating this pathway in chick sympathetic neurons did not block NGF-induced survival or neurite outgrowth(6Borasio G.D. Markus A. Wittinghofer A. Barde Y.-A. Heumann R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the introduction of a constitutively activate Ras mutant into these neurons, unlike with sensory neurons, did not promote their survival (6Borasio G.D. Markus A. Wittinghofer A. Barde Y.-A. Heumann R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, not only is the Ras pathway activated in sympathetic neurons, but the maximum effect of NGF in sympathetic neurons, like in sensory neurons, was observed at a time when programmed cell death eliminates large numbers of neurons in these ganglia. Therefore, although not required or sufficient for survival, NGF signaling via Ras does occur in sympathetic neurons and in a developmentally regulated manner. It is conceivable that in chick sympathetic neurons, unlike sensory neurons, pathways other than Ras are involved in cell survival and that the Ras pathway is required for aspects of differentiation that are not reflected by cell survival or neurite outgrowth, including, for example, regulation of neurotransmitter uptake and synthesis(23Miller F.D. Mathew T.C. Toma J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The stimulation of Ras by BDNF in sensory neurons could only be observed under conditions in which the neurons were not pre-exposed to BDNF. Thus, neurons were cultured with NGF, which is expected to select for NGF-dependent neurons. However, the effects seen after BDNF addition suggest that at least some of these neurons must express TrkB in addition to TrkA. In fact, coexpression of TrkA and TrkB in adult rat has recently been demonstrated in vivo in dorsal root ganglia(24McMahon S.B. Armanini M.P. Ling L.H. Phillips H.S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). During development, however, in situ hybridization studies suggest a largely nonoverlapping pattern of expression, although this technique cannot exclude low but functionally relevant expression of TrkB in neurons expressing predominantly TrkA. In the present study, the finding that NGF-selected cells respond to BDNF by the formation of Ras-GTP (and vice versa) indicates that TrkA and TrkB could both be present in some individual neurons. This was further supported by PCR analysis, which documented the presence of TrkB mRNA in neurons selected with NGF for as long as 60 h after the start of the cultures. However, the possibility that TrkA-expressing neurons secrete BDNF, thereby allowing some TrkB-expressing neurons to survive, cannot be ruled out, especially in view of the cell density used. Coexpression of neurotrophin receptors in at least some neurons is also likely in view of the results obtained with sensory neurons demonstrating that many NGF neurons first depend on NT-3 or BDNF for survival(25Buchman V.L. Davies A.M. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 989-1001PubMed Google Scholar). A shift from NT-3 to NGF dependence has also been suggested by results obtained in vivo in antibody deprivation experiments(26Gaese F. Kolbeck R. Barde Y.-A. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1613-1619PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of Ras-GTP in response to BDNF was not only observed in sensory neurons, but also in granule cells isolated from the postnatal rat cerebellum. Just like with sensory neurons, a striking feature of this response is that it was completely abolished by preincubation of the neurons with BDNF. Unlike with peripheral neurons, cultured neurons from the central nervous system are much less dependent on the addition of exogenous neurotrophin for their survival(19Lindholm D. Dechant G. Heisenberg C.-P. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This, together with the availability of large numbers of cells displaying ~10 times more BDNF receptors than sensory neurons, made them the ideal object for studying the unexpected phenomenon of desensitization. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the loss of response to BDNF, we looked for changes at the level of the receptor. The experiments with the granule cells indicate that in cells treated with BDNF, receptor availability decreases dramatically, as indicated by cross-linking experiments. This is not likely due to a massive receptor degradation since cell lysates obtained from treated and untreated cells seemed to contain comparable levels of full-length TrkB protein in Western blot experiments, in contrast with the drastic loss in binding capacity. Internalized intact receptors are also unlikely to account for the loss in binding since BDNF could not be cross-linked to membranes isolated from BDNF-treated cells. What biochemical mechanism underlies the receptor inactivation is currently under investigation. Interestingly, the phenomenon of desensitization is not observed when similar experiments are performed with TrkB expressed in a cell line able to internalize BDNF at a rate such that ~30% of surface-bound BDNF is internalized within 30 min(27Biffo S. Offenhäuser N. Carter B.D. Barde Y.-A. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 2461-2470PubMed Google Scholar). The conclusion that neuronal receptors for BDNF, while not degraded, become incapable of binding BDNF might also explain recent observations made with embryonic rat cortical and hippocampal neurons(28Widmer H.R. Ohsawa F. Knüsel B. Hefti F. Brain Res. 1993; 614: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A loss of phosphatidylinositol signaling was observed after pre-exposure to BDNF or NT-3. While the physiological significance of BDNF desensitization and receptor inactivation in these neurons is not clear, it is possible that such mechanisms are also observed in vivo. Indeed, in a recent study, it was observed that during rat development, the phosphorylation of TrkB through BDNF in isolated brain tissues becomes increasingly attenuated to become only marginal in adult animals(29Knüsel B. Rabin S.J. Hefti F. Kaplan D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1542-1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could reflect prolonged exposure of neurons to BDNF in vivo since during development, BDNF levels increase from very low levels in early embryonic tissue to substantial levels in the adult brain (see, for example, (30Herzog K.-H. Bailey K. Barde Y.-A. Development (Camb). 1994; 120: 1643-1649PubMed Google Scholar) and (31Maisonpierre P.C. Belluscio L. Friedman B. Alderson R.F. Wiegand S.J. Furth M.E. Lindsay R.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1990; 5: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, in the study by Knüsel et al.(29Knüsel B. Rabin S.J. Hefti F. Kaplan D.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1542-1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of TrkA by NGF was shown to still be possible with tissue from adult brain, suggesting that also in vivo, the phenomenon of desensitization to NGF does not occur. It is interesting to consider the ability of the BDNF receptor to undergo desensitization in the context of recent evidence indicating that BDNF is able to rapidly enhance spontaneous synaptic activity (32Lohof A.M. Ip N.Y. Poo M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Receptor inactivation provides an efficient means of protecting neurons exposed for prolonged periods to BDNF. In addition, it has been reported that cells expressing truncated TrkB receptors can internalize BDNF(27Biffo S. Offenhäuser N. Carter B.D. Barde Y.-A. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 2461-2470PubMed Google Scholar), thus preventing accumulation of BDNF and avoiding desensitization. Of note in this context is the observation that no truncated variants of the NGF receptor TrkA have been found. Finding the mechanisms by which BDNF receptors lose the ability to bind their ligand will be important in order to understand the conditions under which BDNF could be best applied to adult neurons in vivo We thank Dr. Alfredo Rodríguez-Tébar and Dr. Edmund Hoppe for helpful comments and suggestions. We are also grateful to Genentech for the generous supply of BDNF and NGF."

Our own studies progressed from the initial use of oligonucleotides as anti-herpesvirus agents on Vero and MRC-5 cells(9Fennewald S.M. Mustain S. Ojwang J. Rando R.F. Antiviral Res. 1995; 26: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The action of oligonucleotides against herpes simplex virus and human cytomegalovirus have been reported previously(3Azad R.F. Driver V.B. Tanaka K. Crooke R.M. Anderson K.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1945-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Gao W.-Y. Hanes R.N. Vazquez-Padua M.A. Stein C.A. Cohen J.S. Cheng Y.-C. Antimicrob.

Antiviral Res. 1995; 26: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but the actual analysis of the data has been complicated by the ability of the oligonucleotides to operate on the exterior of the cell as inhibitors of viral adsorption. The binding of herpes simplex virus to the cell involves an initial attachment to cell surface heparan sulfate molecules and can be competed by the addition of heparin to the media(21WuDunn D. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 52-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides are particularly potent inhibitors of viral adsorption with effective concentrations in the nanomolar range(9Fennewald S.M. Mustain S. Ojwang J. Rando R.F. Antiviral Res. 1995; 26: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Gao W.-Y. Jaroszewski J.W. Cohen J.S. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) binding, like herpes simplex virus adsorption, involves interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate, we investigated whether oligonucleotides would also inhibit the binding of bFGF to cells. bFGF is a member of the heparin binding family of growth factors(23Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 24Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a widely distributed growth factor found in all organs, solid tissues, tumors, and cultured cells examined(25Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). bFGF binds to high affinity protein receptors in association with cellular matrix heparan sulfate. This association, which is competed by the presence of exogenously added heparin, is necessary for the high affinity and functional binding of bFGF. Heparin-induced dimerization of the growth factor/receptor is required for full activity of the growth factor (26Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Heparin and heparin subfragments can be used to inhibit the biological activity of FGF(27Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 28Ishihara M. Tyrrell D.J. Stauber G.B. Brown S. Cousens L.S. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4675-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it may not be required for all of the FGF effects(29Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The bFGF receptors are members of the group of tyrosine kinase receptors capable of autophosphorylation and dimerization; it is this dimerization that results in an increase in receptor/ligand interaction and signal transduction(30Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar, 31Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In this model of bFGF receptor activity, exogenously added heparin competes with cell surface heparan sulfate and inhibits bFGF activity through the disruption of the dimerization of the receptor. This is similar in concept to the disruption of ligand binding to receptors by the uncoupling of the receptor and the G protein complex for those receptors, which signal through G protein complex formation(32Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar, 33Huang R.-R.C. Dehaven R.N. Cheung A.H. Diehl R.E. Dixon R.A.F. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 304-310PubMed Google Scholar). FGF binding/dimerization and signaling results in a variety of cellular responses including myc, fos, collagenase, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor up-regulation, increases in intracellular pH, hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositol, and phosphorylation of cellular proteins. It induces growth in various cell types including astrocytes, glioma cells, fibroblasts, and, in synergy with hematopoietic growth factors, stem cells. In animal models it is most directly connected with angiogenesis and wound healing. Our studies show that oligonucleotides, especially PS oligonucleotides, are able to inhibit bFGF binding to cells. These observations on bFGF and oligonucleotides, taken together, indicate that although the oligonucleotides studied to date may have therapeutic potential, their level of biologic activity may not be due to the original rational “antisense” design. 125I-bFGF was obtained from DuPont, unlabeled bFGF was obtained from Life Technologies Inc., Vero cells were obtained from the ATCC, and heparin was obtained from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. DNA synthesizer model 380B or 394, using standard phosphoramidite methods. 5′-protected nucleoside phosphoramidite monomers and other reagents were obtained from Milligen with the exception of acetonitrile, which was obtained from Baxter. All oligonucleotides were synthesized with a 3′ Amino Modifier (Glen Research), which results in the covalent attachment of a propanolamine group to the 3′-hydroxl group(34Nelson P.S. Frye R.A. Liu E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7187-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Durland R.H. Kessler D.J. Gunnell S. Duvic M. Pettitt B.M. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9246-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate-containing oligonucleotides were prepared using the sulfurizing agent TETD, which produces a random mixture of R and S isomers(36Vu H. Hirschbein B.L. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 3005-3008Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The purity of the oligonucleotides was confirmed by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography, electrophoresis of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide on a polyacrylamide gel, or capillary gel electrophoresis. The oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) used were: ODN-1 (GTGGTGGTGGTGTTGGTGGTGGTTTGGGGGGTGGGG), ODN-3 (GATCCATGTCAGTGACACTGCGTAGATCCGATGATC), and ODN-4 (GGGTGGGTGGGG). ODN1, ODN-3 and ODN-4 contain phosphorothioate linkages. ODN-2 has a sequence identical to ODN-1 but contains phosphodiester linkages. ODN-5 (GsGsCsToGoCsCoAsToGoGoTsCsCsC) and ODN-6 (GsGsGsAoCoCsAoTsGoGoCoAsGsCsC) contain both phosphodiester and phosphorothioate linkages (designated “o” and “s” in the sequence, respectively). The binding of 125I-bFGF to Vero cell low and high affinity receptors was assayed according to published protocols(29Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of Vero cells in 24-well plates were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 125I-bFGF. The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the low affinity bound bFGF was removed with 2 M NaCl/20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and counted in a Packard liquid scintillation counter. The high affinity receptor bound bFGF was subsequently removed with 2 M NaCl/20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4, and counted. For competition experiments, 125I-bFGF was used at 2.5 ng/ml and mixed with the desired amount of competitor approximately 30 min before addition to cells. For saturation binding of 125I-bFGF to Vero cells in the presence of oligonucleotide and heparin, binding assays were performed using varying amounts of 125I-bFGF and 100 μg/ml heparin, 0.6 μM (7 μg/ml) ODN-1, or 20 μM (78 μg/ml) ODN-4. For high affinity-specific binding, background values obtained from competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled bFGF (mixed with 125I-bFGF prior to the addition to cells) were subtracted before further analysis. bFGF binding to cells is assayed by the incubation of radiolabeled bFGF with cell monolayers with subsequent wash conditions able to distinguish the low affinity heparan sulfate binding from the high affinity protein receptor-specific binding(29Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The bFGF bound to the heparan sulfate is removed with 2 M NaCl at neutral pH. This heparan sulfate binding is not saturated and is not competed away at 100-fold concentrations of unlabeled bFGF. It is however competed away by exogenous heparin or by the addition of other polyanions such as pentosan polysulfate and suramin. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides can also act as appropriate polyanions and inhibit the low affinity heparan sulfate binding of bFGF (Fig. 1A) at submicromolar (0.6 μM) concentrations. The bFGF bound to the high affinity receptors is then removed from the cells with a subsequent low pH rinse. It is this high affinity binding that is specific for the bFGF receptor proteins. This high affinity receptor binding is effectively competed away with unlabeled bFGF (Fig. 1B). Heparan sulfate binding is necessary for the dimerization of the bFGF receptor; therefore, an inhibition of the bFGF low affinity heparan sulfate binding results in a change in the binding to the high affinity protein receptor. The binding constant has been reported to shift from 50 pM with heparan sulfate involvement to 175 pM without such involvement (37Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the bFGF concentration is kept low, then only the high affinity receptor binding resulting from dimerization is detected; the concentration of bFGF is not sufficient for the receptor binding that occurs in the absence of dimerization. Both heparin and PS oligonucleotides inhibit high affinity binding under such conditions (Fig. 1B). When a standard saturation curve is plotted, the difference in binding over an increasing range of bFGF concentrations is seen for both the high and low affinity receptors (Fig. 2). The binding to the high affinity receptors increases more slowly in the presence of the oligonucleotides or heparin, approaching a plateau only at higher concentrations. The concentrations are too low to saturate the binding in the presence of heparin or PS oligonucleotides. At higher bFGF concentrations the bFGF may bind in the presence of heparin, but this binding is not expected to result in signal transduction due to the inability of the receptors to dimerize. It has been shown that although cell surface heparan sulfate is not required for receptor specific binding, it does increase the affinity of basic bFGF for its receptor and facilitates dimerization and activity of FGF (37Roghani M.

Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar Because a variation in the effect of different antisense oligonucleotides is seen when they are assayed for efficacy in the various systems employed, we tested a variety of different oligonucleotides to determine if this variability could be attributed to differences in bFGF binding inhibition. A series of competition experiments was performed in which the concentration of 125I-bFGF was kept constant while the dose of oligonucleotide used in competition was varied. In this way the relative binding affinities of the various oligonucleotides could be compared. Representative results are shown (Fig. 3). Though unlabeled bFGF competed for binding at only the high affinity receptors, as expected, the oligonucleotides and heparin showed similar competition at both the low and the high affinity binding sites. Although the oligonucleotides varied in their ability to block bFGF binding, we were unable to distinguish any sequence or structure that was responsible. The concentration at which 50% of the high affinity binding was inhibited (ID50) was calculated for several representative oligonucleotides and in several conditions (Table 1). The PS oligonucleotides were consistently competitive at lower concentrations than the phosphodiester or partial phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, though the phosphodiester oligonucleotides did have some effect at concentrations greater than 10 μM. A comparison of PS oligonucleotides of various lengths (12-36 bases) showed no direct correlation of length to ID50, but the exact sequence did influence bFGF binding inhibition; two PS oligonucleotides (ODN-1 and ODN-3) of identical length but different sequence both diminish bFGF binding, but the ID50 values differ by 10-fold. The oligonucleotides we used that were composed of G's and T's were generally more effective than mixed sequences, but no firm rules could be established for predicting the relative binding inhibition of the phosphorothioates. The oligonucleotides and heparin are both polymeric anions, but the phosphorothioate modification of the oligonucleotide backbone presumably causes a change in charge or secondary structure that renders the oligonucleotides even more effective in their inhibition of bFGF binding.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In an effort to more closely mimic the various antisense experiments, we also varied the time of addition and incubation of the oligonucleotide. In the standard protocol, the oligonucleotides were mixed with the bFGF prior to the addition to the cells. If the oligonucleotide was preincubated with the cells, instead of with the growth factor, the ID50 was only slightly higher (Table 1). The ID50 was significantly higher if the oligonucleotide was removed prior to the addition of the bFGF but was still less than 5 μM. Although there is some variation in the extent of bFGF inhibition depending on whether the growth factor or the cells are preincubated with oligonucleotide, there is a significant level of activity against bFGF under the conditions of most antisense assays. It should be kept in mind that many cell lines synthesize and secrete bFGF and that endogenously produced bFGF may have significant effect on cell growth and gene expression even in the absence of exogenously added growth factor. Under such conditions there is no possibility of separating the presence of oligonucleotide and bFGF by washing, and the full effect of the binding inhibition may be seen. Inhibition of bFGF binding by phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may account for some of the experimental results attributed in the literature to antisense mechanisms. Antisense experiments often report results using concentrations of PS oligonucleotides in the range of 0.1-50 μM, which we would expect to influence bFGF binding. The 10-fold variation in the activity of the PS oligonucleotides is in the same range as the specific/nonspecific activity of antisense and control oligonucleotides reported for gene disruption experiments. This would be especially true when the assays are for those activities known to be influenced by bFGF, including myc and fos regulation, platelet-derived growth factor and bFGF receptor regulation, hematopoiesis, and cell growth, especially that of vascular smooth muscle cells. Other cellular factors known to interact with polymers include granulocyte macrophage-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, pleitrophin, and platelet factor 4(39Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), as well the entire family of heparin binding growth factors. Any or all of these (and other factors) may be affected in their interaction with cells by polyanions such as PS oligonucleotides. Recently, it has been reported that at least some PS oligonucleotides exert their effect by inhibiting the extracellular binding of interferon gamma (40Ramanathan M. Lantz M. MacGregor R.D. Garavoy M.R. Hunt C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24564-24574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by inhibiting the autophosphorylation of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase(41Bergan R.A. Connell Y. Fahmy B. Kyle E. Neckers L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interpretation of antisense data must be made in light of this effect of polyanions on extracellular binding. In particular, the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell growth by antisense oligonucleotides has progressed rapidly into the effective use of these molecules in animal models of restenosis. Although the proposed mechanism of action of these compounds has been as antisense inhibitors of myc or myb, the simpler explanation is that they are acting, like heparin, as growth factor inhibitors. Heparin and its low molecular weight subfragments have been shown to be potent vascular smooth muscle cell growth inhibitors in vitro(42Clowes A.W. Karnovsky M.J. Nature. 1977; 265: 625-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), are active in animal models of restenosis, and have been used in human clinical trials (43Schmid K.M. Preisack M. Voelker W.

The interpretation of the results of these cell culture and animal trials of antisense therapeutics for restenosis and other indications should be made in light of the similarity in action between polyanions, heparin, and PS oligonucleotides on the action of growth factors"
https://openalex.org/W2048767410,"The structures of the cyanide and triiodide complexes of Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase (ARP) at different pH values were investigated by x-ray crystallography in order to examine the behavior of the invariant residues of arginine (Arg-52) and distal histidine (His-56) during the enzyme reaction as well as to provide the structural basis of the active site of peroxidase. The models of the cyanide complexes at pH 7.5, 5.0, and 4.0, respectively, were refined to the R-factors of 17.8, 17.8, and 18.5% using 7.0-1.6-Å resolution data, and those of the triiodide complexes at pH 6.5 and 5.0 refined to 16.9 and 16.8% using 7.0-1.9-Å resolution data.The structures of the cyanide complexes at pH 7.5, 5.0, and 4.0 are identical within experimental error.

The distance between the Nɛ atom of His-56 and the nitrogen atom of the cyanide suggests the presence of a hydrogen bond between them in the pH range investigated. In the triiodide complexes, one of the two triiodides bound to ARP was located at the distal side of the heme.

Peroxidases (donor: H2O2 oxidoreductase (EC 1.11.1.7)) are a class of heme proteins which oxidize a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds by the use of hydrogen peroxide. In addition to their physiological importance, they have attracted attention because of useful applications which include assays of biological substances (Allain et al., 1974; Akimoto et al., 1990) and large scale use for deliginification and the bleaching of dyes (Pedersen and Carlsen, 1994). The reaction generally consists of the following steps (Reactions I-IV). Peroxidase (Fe(III))+H2O2→compound I (Fe(IV)⋅)+H2OPeroxidase I (Fe(IV))+AH2→compound II (Fe(IV))+AH⋅Compound II (Fe(IV))+AH2→Peroxidase I(Fe(III))+AH⋅2AH⋅→A2H2 or A+ AH2REACTION STEPS I-IV Since the crystal structure of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP), 1The abbreviations used are: CCPyeast cytochrome c peroxidaseARPArthromyces ramosus peroxidaseLiPlignin peroxidase. a typical class I peroxidase (Welinder, 1992), was first determined at 1.7-Å resolution (Finzel et al., 1984), the mechanism of compound I formation, the first step in the above equations, has been proposed for CCP. The mechanism of compound I formation suggested is that the distal histidine and arginine concertedly stabilize charge separation and facilitate proton transfer from one oxygen to the other of the peroxide as well as heterolytic cleavage of its O-O bond (Finzel et al., 1984). To confirm the validity of this mechanism, mutant CCP proteins have been prepared, and their three-dimensional structures and spectroscopic and kinetic properties extensively studied. For example, Erman et al.(1993) reported that the distal histidine is critical for the rapid formation of compound I of CCP, and Vitello et al.(1993) reported that arginine is responsible for substrate binding in the heme pocket and for stabilizing compound I. yeast cytochrome c peroxidase Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase lignin peroxidase. The three-dimensional structures of a lignin peroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium (LiP), a peroxidase from Arthromyces ramosus (ARP) and a manganase peroxidase from P. chrysosporium (all class II peroxidases) have been, respectively, determined at 2.0-, 1.9-, and 2.06-Å resolutions (Edwards et al., 1993; Piontek et al., 1993; Poulos et al., 1993; Kunishima et al., 1994; Sundaramoorthy et al., 1994)). 2The crystal structure of a peroxidase from Coprinus cinereus, very similar to ARP in the amino acid sequence (Baunsgaard et al., 1993; Sawai-Hatanaka et al., 1995), at 2.6-Å resolution was reported by Petersen et al. (1994). Although the modes of molecular packing differ, probably because of the difference in the precipitants used for crystallization, the molecular structures appear identical. Although the histidine and arginine residues at the distal side of the heme are conserved in ARP and LiP, structural comparison of these peroxidases with CCP has shown that the conformations of the distal histidine residue (His-56 in ARP) relative to the heme differ (Kunishima et al., 1994). In addition, preliminary structural refinement of the triiodide complex of ARP, used for phase determination by the isomorphous replacement method (Kunishima et al., 1994), has shown that the behavior of the distal arginine (Arg-52 in ARP) differs from that observed in CCP when it forms a complex with fluoride (Edwards and Poulos, 1990) or when it is converted to compound I (Fülöp et al., 1994). Unexpectedly preliminary ligand binding experiment showed that most ligands bound hardly to the heme besides triiodide and cyanide. Because the behavior of these residues may be affected by the pH, we examined how the structure of ARP changes when it binds ligand at different pH values. Heme proteins that form complexes with ligands have been investigated extensively to elucidate the nature of the heme iron and structure-property relationships, such as the spin state versus the displacement of the iron atom from the heme plane (Perutz, 1970). For peroxidases, although the cyanide bound forms of CCP, LiP, horseradish peroxidase, and Coprinus cinereus peroxidase have been characterized by NMR (Satterlee and Erman, 1991; de Ropp et al., 1991; Banci et al., 1991; Thanabal et al., 1988; Veitch et al., 1994), crystallographic studies of these forms are lacking; only the structures of the inhibitor-bound forms of CCP are known (Edwards and Poulos, 1990). In addition, different modes of ligation to the heme have been reported; e.g. in CCP cyanide binds to the heme iron in a tilted configuration (Edwards and Poulos, 1990), whereas in metmyoglobin it binds to its heme iron in a bent configuration (Neya et al., 1993). This difference might be ascribed to the protein environment of the heme, but it is likely that for some heme proteins unambiguous results could not be obtained because of the lack of detailed three-dimensional structures. In particular, in the case that ligand sizes are small, a high resolution x-ray crystal structure is required to detect any subtle structural change and to define the mode of ligand binding. We present here detailed structural features of the heme and its environment as deduced from high resolution x-ray analysis of the cyanide and triiodide complexes and show the behavior of the distal histidine and arginine residues when ARP binds to cyanide and triiodide. The formation of each ARP complex in solution was monitored by ultraviolet-visible absorption using a SHIMADZU UV-3101PC spectrophotometer. For the cyanide complex, the buffer used was 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the ionic strength of the solution was adjusted to 0.1 M by adding potassium chloride. 200 μM potassium cyanide solution was added stepwise (5 μl/time) to 1 ml of 5.3 μM ARP solution, after which the spectrum was measured by the spectrophotometer. Complex formation of ARP with triiodide was monitored by adding 3 mM KI3 solution stepwise to 6 μM ARP solution containing 1 mM KI. The equilibria of triiodide and ARP were examined at pH 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0, the buffers used being 50 mM sodium succinate for pH 6.0, 50 mM Tris-HCl for pH 7.5, and 50 mM sodium borate for pH 9.0. The ionic strength of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 0.1 M with sodium nitrate. 3 mM KI3 solution was prepared by diluting 30 mM KI3 stock solution (prepared by adding iodine to about 8 eq molar excess KI) with 100 mM KI solution. Preparation of the fluoride complex was attempted by adding sodium fluoride to the ARP solution at pH 5.5. But the absorption spectrum did not change significantly even when a 30 eq molar excess of sodium fluoride was added. 3Preparation of the fluoride complex was attempted by soaking the ARP crystal for 3 h in 1 mM sodium fluoride solution containing 33% saturated ammonium sulfate at pH 5.5. Data collection and structure analysis were the same as for the other complexes. This crystal was isomorphous with the native ARP crystal. The electron density map at 1.9-Å resolution showed no density ascribable to the sixth ligand of the heme, where the phase angles were derived from the structure of native ARP at pH 7.5. Moreover, no significant conformational change was seen in any of the residues. ARP was purified and crystallized as described previously (Kunishima et al., 1993). Cyanide-derivative crystals of ARP were prepared by soaking the native ARP crystals for 2 h in mother liquor containing 1 mM KCN, 33% saturated ammonium sulfate. The buffers used were 50 mM Tris-HCl for pH 7.5, 50 mM sodium acetate for pH 5.0, and 50 mM sodium formate for pH 4.0. Treatment with cyanide changed the color of the crystal from brown to red. This reaction appeared to be completed within 1 h. The triiodide-derivative crystals were prepared by soaking native ARP crystals for 2 h in mother liquor consisting of 33% saturated ammonium sulfate, 20 mM sodium succinate, pH 6.0, and 2 mM KI3. The derivative crystals were isomorphous with the native ones. For preparation of the derivative, it was essential to lower the pH. The crystal soaked at pH 7.5 showed little change in x-ray diffraction intensity. Data were collected at 20°C using synchrotron radiation and the screenless Weissenberg camera for macromolecular crystals (Sakabe, 1991) at the BL6A2 station of the Photon Factory, the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics. X-rays were focused with a cylindrical-bent asymmetric cut Si(111) monochromator. The wavelength was 1.00 Å. A collimator with a diameter of 0.1 mm was used. Each crystal was oscillated around the a+b axis. The radius of the film cassettes, each of which had Fuji Imaging Plates with detection areas of 40 × 20 cm, were 286.5 mm for the data collections of the cyanide complexes and 429.7 mm for those of the triiodide complexes. Data for each complex were obtained from a single crystal. Diffraction data recorded on each imaging plate were read out at 100-μm intervals with a Fuji BA100 then processed with the program systems WEIS (Higashi, 1989) and PROTEIN (Steigemann, 1974). Partial reflections were discarded. The conditions and results of data collection are given in Table 1.1 Open table in a new tab Initially phases were calculated from the model of the native ARP refined at 1.9 Å (Kunishima et al., 1994; PDB code 1ARP). This model was checked with FRODO (Jones, 1978; Roussel and Cambillau, 1989) on an IRIS 4D/35GT computer graphics system. Refinement was done with simulated annealing using the program XPLOR (Brünger et al., 1990; Brünger, 1992). Initially for each cyanide complex, the solvent molecules around the heme were omitted, and the model was refined by XPLOR using the diffraction data with F>2σF in the 7.0-1.6-Å resolution range. A 2Fo - Fc map clearly located the cyanide ion at the sixth coordination position of the heme iron. When the positions of the peaks in the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps satisfied the geometries of the hydrogen bond with the protein and/or another water molecule, they were included in the subsequent refinement. The final refinement was done including the solvent molecules as well as the cyanide ion. For the triiodide complexes, a difference Fourier map with the coefficient of (FI3 - Fp) exp(iαp) at 2.2-Å resolution located two clearly resolved triiodide ions near the heme, where FI3 and Fp are the structure factors of the triiodide complex and the native crystal, respectively. An Fo - Fc difference Fourier using the refined derivative phases (ασF) was then used to position the water molecules. Final refinement used the diffraction data with F>2σF in the 7.0-1.9-Å resolution range. Results are given in Table 2. The mean coordinate error for each model is estimated to be about 0.2 Å (Luzatti, 1952).2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 compares the absorption spectra of the cyanide and triiodide complexes with that of the native ARP. Cyanide binding to ARP results in a rapid spectral shift in λmax from 405 to 423 nm with an isosbestic point at 414 nm. The spectral change was completed when a 3.7 eq molar excess of cyanide to ARP was added. Other spectral changes seen on cyanide binding are the disappearance of the peaks at 505 and 645 nm and appearance of peaks at 364 and 550 nm. There was little pH dependence of the spectra in the range between pH 9.0 and 5.5, which is consistent with the findings for C. cinereus peroxidase (Lukat et al., 1989). The spectra clearly show that treatment with cyanide converts the electronic state of the heme iron from Fe(III) high-spin to Fe(III) low-spin (Morita et al., 1988). Triiodide binding to ARP results in a shift of λmax from 405 to 402 with an isosbestic point at 414 nm. The spectrum of the triiodide complex is apparently the high-spin type. The ARP spectra with 1 eq triiodide added to the solution at pH 7.5 and 9.0 were similar to the spectra at pH 6.0 (data not shown). When ammonium sulfate, however, was present in the solution, the binding of triiodide to ARP was inhibited at a pH higher than 7.0. In both complexes, neither gross nor secondary structures changed when triiodide or cyanide bound to ARP in the pH range investigated. The O-glycoside bonded to Ser-339 and N-glycoside beyond the second residue bonded to Asn-143 as well as residues 1-8 were invisible in the electron density maps as in the native crystal (Kunishima et al., 1994). The Cα atoms of the native crystal and those of the cyanide or triiodide complex superpose within experimental error. The structural refinements of the complexes by XPLOR, however, yielded models in which the side chain conformations of Met-243 (located at the proximal side of the heme) differ. The difference Fourier map calculated with each structural model showed residual electron density near the side chain, indicative of the presence of several conformers. Neither the pH value nor the species of the bound ion appeared to correlate with a favorable conformer of this side chain. It is likely that the side chain of Met-243 is flexible. The (2Fo - Fc) map of the cyanide complex at pH 5.0 is shown in Fig. 2. The maps at pH 7.5 and 4.0 were very similar to the map at pH 5.0. The electron density corresponding to cyanide is clearly visible at the sixth coordination position of the heme iron. The geometries around the heme iron are summarized in Table 3. The hemes in the cyanide complexes are, as in the native and triiodide complexes, distorted into a saddle shape, with pyrroles I and II tilted toward the proximal side and pyrroles II and IV tilted toward the distal side.3 Open table in a new tab The heme in a protein binds to a cyanide with the C-N bond being often tilted from the normal of the heme plane, where two ways of binding are possible: tilt and bent conformations (Deatherage et al., 1976). As deviation from the spherical shape of the electron density is small due to the short C-N distance of the cyanide (1.15 Å), it was difficult to define its orientation precisely even by 1.6-Å resolution analysis. From Table 3 there appears to be no clear correlation between the bent angles and pH values. The cyanide is tilted slightly from the normal of the heme plane (the mean angle of the Fe•••C(CN) vector to the heme plane is 87°), and the bending of Fe•••C-N is significant (the mean angle of Fe•••C-N is 159°). Therefore the bent configuration is more likely for the cyanide complex of ARP. Edwards and Poulos(1990), however, reported that the cyanide model fit slightly better to the electron density in the tilted configuration on the basis of the x-ray crystal structure analysis of the cyanide bound complex of CCP at 1.85-Å resolution. A structural comparison between the native ARP and the cyanide complex is shown in Fig. 3. Upon cyanide binding, a small but notable structural change occurred at the distal histidine (His-56); the imidazole ring rotated around the Cβ-Cγ bond by 12° so that the Nɛ atom was close to the cyanide. The CN•••Nɛ(His-56) distances in the complexes range from 2.75 to 2.80 Å (Table 3), and the other geometries are excellent for hydrogen bonding. The fact that there is sufficient space for the cyanide to take the other orientation without rearrangement of the protein strongly suggests that the cyanide nitrogen and Nɛ atom of His-56 are close together due to an attracting force. Therefore it is most likely that the cyanide is hydrogen bonded to the Nɛ of His-56 at all the pH values investigated. The crystal structure of the cyanide-bound CCP at pH 6 indicated a hydrogen bond between the cyanide and the Nɛ of the distal histidine (His-52) but it was not defined whether cyanide or His-52 was the donor of the bond (Edwards and Poulos, 1990). NMR studies on cyanide-bound horseradish peroxidase, CCP, LiP, and C. cinereus peroxidase enabled assignment of the signal of the hydrogen atom bonded to each Nɛ of the distal histidine in the pH range of 7 and 6 (Thanabal et al., 1988; Satterlee and Erman, 1991; de Ropp et al., 1991; Veitch et al., 1994). Our present crystallographic and NMR results show that it is reasonable that His-56 is the hydrogen donor in the hydrogen bond in the cyanide-bound ARP, which is why its Nɛ is protonated in the pH range investigated. The Nɛ atom of His-56 must be protonated because the hydrogen bond network of Nɛ (His-56)•••C=O (Asn-93) and NH2 (Asn-93)•••C=O (Glu-87) is retained in the cyanide complexes. The hydrogen bond between the Nɛ atom of His-56 and the cyanide even at pH 7.5 is noteworthy because the Nɛ atom of the distal histidine is usually deprotonated at pH 7.5, the pKa value of the free histidine being about 6. We conclude that the pKa of the hydrogen-bonded network of CN-•••H+-His-56 in the cyanide complex is much higher than that of the distal histidine in the native enzyme. Upon cyanide binding, a few of the water molecules are rearranged to form a hydrogen bond network, the cyanide pushing Wat-674 away by 1.6 Å and Wat-676 by 1.8 Å (Fig. 3). Fig. 4a shows the (FI3 - Fnative) exp(iαnative) difference electron density map superimposed on the entire ARP model and demonstrates that all the significant changes are confined to the active site. Two triiodides bound to one molecule of ARP; one near the entrance of the substrate access channel (external site), the other to the active site (internal site). The external site is a mixture of two individual sites and two of the four iodine atom positions coincide. This explains why least-squares refinement of the heavy atom parameters in the isomorphous replacement method indicated that the occupancy of one of the three iodine atoms was low (Kunishima et al., 1994). The electron density of triiodide was clearly divided to each iodine atom (Fig. 4b). The minus peak near the imidazole ring of His-56 apparently shows the conformational change of His-56 caused by the binding of triiodide. Structural refinement of each triiodide complex, in which the occupancy and temperature factors of the triiodide ions were refined alternately using XPLOR at the final stage, suggests that the triiodide is fully bound to the heme. The geometry of the triiodide bound heme is given in Table 4. For convenience, iodine atoms of the internal site are named IA, IB, and IC in the order of their proximity to the heme iron. IA is placed above the heme iron, and the triiodide is nearly parallel to the heme plane. The interaction between the heme iron and the triiodide appears to be weak as judged by the little spectral change on triiodide binding.4 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5 shows the superposition of the active site residues of the triiodide complex on those of native ARP. The side chain of Arg-52 moved marginally toward IB on triiodide binding, the maximum positional shift being 0.19 Å at Nη1. The hydrogen bonding scheme was unchanged. The side chain of Arg-52 forms hydrogen bonds with two amino acids (Ala-92, Gly-94) and one buried water molecule (Wat-394). In contrast to Arg-52 in ARP, a small but significant conformational change of His-56 was induced by triiodide binding. The imidazole ring of His-56 rotated along the Cα-Cβ and Cβ-Cγ bonds by 8 and 4°, respectively, resulting in the maximum positional shift of 0.73 Å at Nδ. This movement must be due to the large van der Waals radius of the iodine atom; the distance between IA in the triiodide complex and Nɛ (His-56) is only 2.85 Å, less than the sum of their van der Waals radii, if the conformation of His-56 is unchanged. The orientation of the imidazole ring of the distal histidine in ARP differs from the orientations in CCP and LiP (Table 5). They are constrained by the hydrogen bond between the Nδ atom and the O=C of asparagine (Asn-93 in ARP) (Kunishima et al., 1994). The rotations caused by triiodide binding occurred in a direction such that the conformation of His-56 in ARP was close to the conformations in CCP and LiP, but their amounts were not large compared to the difference between the tortion angles in these peroxidases.5 Open table in a new tab Generally the iron of ferric heme proteins in the low-spin state lies in the heme plane, whereas in the high-spin state it deviates from the plane toward the proximal side (Perutz, 1970; Kuriyan et al., 1986; Quillin et al., 1993; Neya et al., 1993); but, in the ligand-bound forms of CCP this correlation is lacking (Edwards and Poulos, 1993). The present crystallographic results (3, 4) show that the heme iron is located on the heme plane in the cyanide complex (deviation 0.04 Å) but is displaced from that plane (0.17 Å) toward the proximal side in the triiodide complex. Moreover in the native ARP at pH 5.5, where the heme iron is pentacoordinated and in the high-spin state, the iron atom is displaced from the heme plane by 0.18 Å. 4N. Kunishima, F. Amada, K. Fukuyama, M. Kawamoto, T. Matsunaga, and H. Matsubara, unpublished results. Kunishima et al. (1994) reported that the heme of ARP at pH 7.5 was hexacoordinated, the 6th position of the heme being occupied by a water molecule. Recently the 6th ligand, however, was characterized as ammonia derived from ammonium sulfate used as the precipitant in crystallization, and the absorption spectrum indicated that ARP at pH 7.5 had a low-spin component to some extent.4 The displacement of the iron atom from the plane at pH 7.5 is 0.07 Å. Therefore in the case of ARP the correlation between the spin-state and the displacement of the iron atom from the heme plane is clearly seen. The distal arginine has been proposed to be responsible for substrate binding and for stabilizing compound I (Vitello et al., 1993). The present crystallographic studies of the ligand-bound forms of ARP showed that Arg-52 moved little on ligand binding. In contrast, the distal arginine (Arg-48) in CCP moved markedly when it bound to fluoride (Edwards and Poulos, 1990), its side chain by about 2 Å to optimize the hydrogen-bonded interactions with the fluorine atom. In addition, when CCP was converted to compound I, the side chain of Arg-48 moved close to the ferryl oxygen atom to form a hydrogen bond (Fülöp et al., 1994). These results indicate that the side chain of the distal arginine of ARP is more tightly fixed than CCP. In fact, ARP has more hydrogen bonds than CCP for anchoring the side chain. It appears that little movement of Arg-52 occurs during compound I formation in ARP. Finzel et al.(1984) speculated on the coordination of hydroperoxide to CCP, and on the basis of the structure of the fluoride-bound CCP, Edwards and Poulos(1990) suggested that O1 becomes hydrogen-bonded to both NɛH and Nη2H+ of the distal arginine (Arg-48; identical to Arg-52 in ARP) by movement of its side chain during compound I formation. One of the functional roles of the distal arginine is neutralization of the negative charge of fluoride (as well as HOO-), and in the case of CCP, fluoride binding to the heme was achieved by movement of its side chain. We obtained no evidence that ARP forms a complex with fluoride ion. In the case of ARP the assumed position of the fluoride and that of the Nɛ of Arg-52 are too far apart to interact. A possible explanation for the inability of ARP to form a stable fluoride complex is the lack of interaction, because the side chain of Arg-52 of ARP is fixed. The distal histidine has been proposed to catalyze proton translocation from one oxygen to the other of the hydrogen peroxide by acid-base catalysis. The mechanism of compound I formation proposed for ARP is shown schematically in Fig. 6. Important questions arise immediately about the behavior of the active site residues of ARP in enzyme catalysis. 1) How does the substrate bind to the active site of ARP in which the conformation of the side chain of Arg-52 is fixed at the site observed in the native enzyme? 2) Does the imidazole of His-56 have favorable geometries for proton translocation? In order to gain insight into enzyme catalysis, we examined the structures of the substrate-enzyme complex and transitional complex using computer graphics. The proposed model of the H2O2-enzyme complex is shown in Fig. 7. Hydrogen peroxide would displace two water molecules in the active site; Wat-674 which is the closest one to the heme iron and is hydrogen-bonded to the Nɛ of His-56, and Wat-675 which is hydrogen-bonded to the Nɛ of Arg-52 and Wat-674. It is possible to place hydrogen peroxide on the distal side of the heme in such a way that one oxygen atom is on the heme iron and the other is hydrogen bonded to Arg-52 without conformational change in the Arg-52 side chain. If the H-O-O-H torsion angle in hydrogen peroxide is assumed to be orthogonal, a stable conformer, the hydrogen bond of Nɛ-H (Arg-52)•••O1 will direct the O2-H bond toward the Nɛ of His-56 because the Nɛ of Arg-52 bears hydrogen and is a donor of the hydrogen bond. Such geometry of the hydrogen peroxide relative to the active site of ARP appears to be favorable for the subsequent proton abstraction from O2 to the Nɛ of His-56. Directing the Nɛ-H of His-56 toward O1 for proton translocation is achieved by rotations around the Cβ-Cγ and Cα-Cβ bonds. The directions of these rotations are the same as when triiodide binds to ARP, but the amount is larger. If these bonds were rotated so as to place H-Nɛ (His-56) on the O1 atom with the remaining residues unchanged, the geometries of the hydrogen bond between Nɛ of His-56 and Oδ of Asn-93 would become unfavorable. To achieve a tetrahedral arrangement around O1, i.e. to interact the O1 and His-56-Nɛ, which is favorable for the subsequent proton translocation from His-56Nɛ to O1, another type of additional movement such as the shift of hydroperoxide and/or the dynamic behavior of the protein molecule should be considered. 5We tried to prepare the crystal of compound I by soaking the native ARP crystal in mother liquor containing 300 μM to 10 mM H2O2 in the pH range of 4.5 to 9.0. Unexpectedly, treatment of the crystal with hydrogen peroxide did not lead to the color characteristic of compound I, although the color of the ARP solution changed immediately when hydrogen peroxide solution was added. Even when ammonium sulfate was replaced by sodium sulfate by the soaking method, no color change in the crystal was visually detectable on adding hydrogen peroxide. (The crystal became bleached when soaked in hydrogen peroxide solution at a high concentration for a long time.) We have no explanation for this inactivity of ARP in a crystalline state. Clearly, however, enzyme catalysis in the crystalline state is limited by the crystal packing force because it is unlikely that hydrogen peroxide did not access to the active site of ARP as judged by the rapid diffusion of both cyanide and triiodide ions into the crystals. One possible explanation is that in ARP global movement of the molecule is required for enzyme catalysis. This point requires future analysis. We could not build a reasonable model of the transitional complex II for ARP assuming that the conformation of the distal histidine is retained as in the native enzyme. In conclusion, the structures of the native and triiodide-bound form of ARP suggest that the mechanism of compound I formation of ARP is similar to that of CCP as proposed by Finzel et al.(1984). The behavior of the active site residues during compound I formation for ARP differs, however, from that for CCP. Our computer modeling study suggests that Arg-52 maintains the conformation of hydrogen peroxide favorable for compound I formation without side chain movement and that conformational flexibility of His-56 is necessary for proton translocation from one oxygen atom to the other of the hydroperoxide.

INTRODUCTIONThe Sty gene encodes a member of the recently discovered family of dual specificity kinases(1Howell B.W. Afar D.E.H. Lew J. Douville E.M.J. Icely P.L.E. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Ben-David Y. Letwin K. Tannock L. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To date, at least 18 distinct genes encoding dual specificity kinases have been identified in the genomes of yeast and mammals (for reviews, see Douville et al.(3Douville E.M.J. Duncan P.I. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Cancer Metast. Rev. 1994; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and Lindberg et al.(4Lindberg R.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). These kinases, expressed either as bacterial products or isolated from mammalian cells, have the ability to autophosphorylate on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. Two of the best studied of these enzymes are the yeast wee1+ kinase, a regulator of progression through the cell cycle(5Featherstone C. Russell P. Nature. 1991; 349: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase), believed to be a key molecule in mitogen-stimulated signaling pathways (6Nakielny S. Cohen P. Wu J. Sturgill T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2123-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the cloning of the murine Sty cDNA which when expressed in bacteria encodes a protein capable of phosphorylating serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in vitro(1Howell B.W. Afar D.E.H. Lew J. Douville E.M.J. Icely P.L.E. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The STY kinase contains an amino acid motif, LAMMER, found in kinase subdomain X(7Yun B. Farkas R. Rabinow L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1160-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a feature which is shared with at least eight other dual specificity kinases expressed in humans, mice, plants, and insects(7Yun B. Farkas R. Rabinow L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1160-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Bender J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The LAMMER motif containing protein kinases appears to be conserved throughout evolution suggesting that these enzymes may play important roles in the control of cellular growth and differentiation. Indeed, the Doa kinase, a Drosophila gene product, is critical to the development of the fly embryo and affects eye differentiation in the adult(7Yun B. Farkas R. Rabinow L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1160-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10Rabinow L. Birchler J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The AFC1 kinase gene of Arabidopsis thaliana can complement yeast signal transduction mutants via activation of the transcription factor STE12(8Bender J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12105-12109Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the physiological function of the LAMMER kinases is largely unknown although overexpression of the STY kinase in PC12 cells appears to initiate their differentiation into neural derivatives possibly through activation of a protein kinase cascade(11Myers M.P. Murphy M.B. Landreth G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6954-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As has been observed with other members of the LAMMER kinase family, the Sty gene appears to express several differentially processed transcripts. To gain a full understanding of the physiological role of the STY kinase, we felt it important to identify and biochemically characterize all its gene products. We report here the cloning and sequencing of three novel Sty cDNAs. Two of these cDNAs are derived from incompletely processed transcripts which accumulate in the nucleus in a developmentally regulated fashion. The third cDNA encodes a truncated polypeptide (STYT), which like the full-length STY kinase is found in the nucleus and contains domains which facilitate dimerization. Furthermore, we present evidence that the STY kinase is able to phosphorylate serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues when expressed in mammalian cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of cDNA LibraryAn L1210 leukemia cell line cDNA library was constructed in λgt10 from size-selected poly(A)+ RNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was fractionated through a 2-10% sucrose gradient in 85% formamide, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2% SDS. Gradients were run at 200,000 × g for 20 h at 20°C. Following centrifugation, 0.4-ml fractions were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by Northern blotting using a Sty cDNA probe. Fractions containing RNA larger than 1.8 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)mAbmonoclonal antibodyTyr(P)phosphotyrosineEexonIintronGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRT-PCRreverse transcription polymerase chain reactionMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. were pooled and precipitated with ethanol. cDNA was generated with 5 μg of size-selected poly(A)+ RNA using the SuperScript cDNA synthesis system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was subsequently size-selected for products larger than 1 kb by gel filtration (Sepharose 4B, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).Isolation of cDNA ClonesThe λgt10 library was screened using a full-length Sty cDNA probe. From a screen of 200,000 plaques, 18 positives were identified. Six were chosen at random for further analysis. To determine the size of the inserts, PCR was employed to amplify cDNA using λgt10 and Sty specific primers. Briefly, pairs of λgt10/Sty primers were used to amplify DNA from the primary plaques of the library. Primer pairs were λgt10 forward (5′agcaagttcagcctggttaag3′) and Sty619F (5′tccaccacttttccgaaagcac3′) or λgt10 reverse (5′cttatgagtatttcttccagggta3′) and Sty619F. 50-μl PCR reactions were performed with 50 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM concentration of each dNTP, 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase in 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml gelatin. PCR conditions were 94°C, 40 s; 50°C, 60 s; 72°C, 2 min for 30 cycles. Amplified products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Two clones yielding inserts of approximately 2.6 kb were plaque-purified by standard procedures(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Sequencing of cDNA ClonesThe cDNA inserts were subcloned into the KpnI site of the plasmid pGEM-4 (Promega). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was carried out using the dideoxy chain termination method(13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52360) Google Scholar). Full-length sequence of the cDNA insert was achieved using oligonucleotide primers.Northern Hybridization AnalysisTotal RNA was prepared from cells or tissues as described by Chirgwin et al.(14Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was selected by passage of total RNA through oligo(dT)-cellulose columns as described by Jacobson(15Jacobson A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To isolate nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA NIH 3T3 cells (3-5 × 107) were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and lysed in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were removed from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation for 5 min at 1200 × g. Total nuclear and total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from these fractions as outlined above. Aliquots of total RNA (20 μg) were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels containing 19% formaldehyde, 40 mM MOPS, 10 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, transferred to Hybond N membrane (Amersham), and UV-cross-linked as described by the manufacturer. Hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC (0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1% (w/v) Ficoll, 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, 150 μg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA, with a random-primed 32P-labeled Sty cDNA probe at 42°C. Blots were washed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. The positions of 18 S and 28 S RNA were determined by ethidium bromide staining of the agarose gel.RT-PCR Analysis and Cloning of StyTTotal RNA from P19 cells or mouse tissues was used to synthesize oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA with SuperScript RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 1-2 μl of a 20-μl cDNA synthesis reaction was subsequently used in a PCR amplification. 50-μl reactions were performed containing 20 pmol of primer Sty619F, 20 pmol of primer of Sty93R (5′cggatccatgagacattcaaagagaact3′), and 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase for 30-40 cycles under the conditions described above. StyT cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using primer Sty7R (5′catcgtcgtaatcgtttgc3′) and primer Sty1539F (5′cgtatgctttttaagtgg3′). Amplified products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining.Sequencing of RT-PCR ProductsAmplified PCR products were gel-purified and cloned directly into the pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen) (7R/1539F product) or digested with HindIII and SacI restriction endonucleases (93R/619F product) and subcloned into the plasmid pTZ19R (Pharmacia) following conventional procedures(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed as described above.Identification of Additional IntronsAdditional introns were identified within the Sty gene by sequencing of genomic fragments isolated from a D3 embryonic stem cell genomic library (gift of D. A. Gray) and subcloned into pGEM-4 (Promega).Construction of cDNA Expression Vectors and Tagged ProteinspECE/Sty was generated by insertion of Sty cDNA into the mammalian expression vector pECE(16Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The 1.7-kb Sty fragment was isolated from pTZ19R/Sty by PCR amplification using the following oligonucleotides: 5′cggatccatgagacattcaaagagaact3′ (including a BamHI site at the 5′ end) and reverse sequencing primer (5′agcggataacaatttcacacagga3′). This fragment was subsequently digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pECE previously digested with SmaI and EcoRI.The STY polypeptide was tagged at the amino terminus with a six-repeat human Myc epitope by subcloning the Myc epitope isolated from Bluescript KS+ MTG (17Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (SalI/PstI-blunted fragment) into the pECE/Sty plasmid (KpnI-blunted). The Myc epitope in pECE/M-Sty was confirmed to be in-frame by sequencing.pECE/M-StyK190R and pECE/M-StyT were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis using the pECE/M-Sty plasmid as template and the following oligonucleotides: 5′gcatagttaaaaatgtggatag3′ and 5′gcactgctacacgtctac3′ for pECE/M-StyK190R or 5′cccgtgtgaatggtgctg3′ and 5′atgaaattgttgatactttaggt3′ for pECE/M-StyT. 50-μl reactions were performed containing 20 ng of plasmid, 25 pmol of each oligonucleotide, 0.2 mM concentration of each dNTP, 2 units of Vent (exo) DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) in buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Amplification conditions were 95°C, 1 min; 56°C, 1 min; 72°C, 5 min for 20 cycles. The reaction product was phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and recircularized with T4 DNA ligase.An amino-terminal deletion mutant, pECE/M-StyΔXhoII, lacking the first 60 amino acids of STY, was created by substitution of the BamHI/BamHI Sty fragment from pECE/M-Sty with the XhoII/BamHI Sty fragment generated by subsequent digestion of the BamHI/BamHI fragment with XhoII. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing.The Myc epitope in these constructs is immunoreactive with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10 in immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis(18Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar).Sty was also subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-3X (Pharmacia) to generate the fusion protein GST-STY. The 1.7-kb Sty fragment was isolated from pTZ19R/Sty by PCR amplification as described above. This blunt/EcoRI fragment was subcloned into pGEX-3X (BamHI, blunted, followed by EcoRI digestion). Sty was confirmed to be in-frame with GST by sequencing.COS-1 Cell Culture and TransfectionCOS-1 cells were maintained in a minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. For transient transfection, COS-1 cells were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in serum-free α-minimal essential medium at 2-3 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml. 20 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA was added, and the cells were chilled on ice for 10 min. Cells were electroporated using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 220 V and 960 μF following which the cells were left at room temperature for 15 min. Transfectants were then plated in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% calf serum in the absence or presence of 50 μM sodium vanadate. Cells were harvested 24 h later.Immunoprecipitation/Immunoblot AnalysisTransfected COS-1 cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 500 μM sodium vanadate, 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with either mAb 9E10 or anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2 containing 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were arrested by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer followed by boiling. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film.For immunoblots, membranes were blocked in 5% Blotto in TBST (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20). Anti-Myc immunoblotting was performed using ammonium sulfate-precipitated 9E10 hybridoma culture supernatant at 1:50-1:100. Immunoblots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) and exposure to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously(19Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence of M-STY in COS-1 CellsFollowing transfection of pECE constructs into COS-1 cells, approximately 7.5 × 104 cells were plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips. 22-24 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in −20°C methanol for 10 min at −20°C. Following rehydration of cells in phosphate-buffered saline, anti-Myc mAb (1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100) was added followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:20, DAKO).GST-STY Binding ColumnsGST-STY binding reactions were carried out essentially as described(20Muller A.J. Pendergast A.-M. Havlik M.H. Puil L. Pawson T. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5087-5093Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterially expressed GST or GST-STY was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) in immunoprecipitation buffer. Approximately 10 μg of GST or GST-STY coupled to beads was used in each binding experiment. COS-1 cell lysates containing M-STY, M-STYT, or M-Tik were mixed with GST or GST-STY beads. Incubations were carried out for 2 h at 4°C on a rotating platform. The beads were then washed with immunoprecipitation buffer, and proteins were eluted with sample buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-Myc mAb.Nucleotide Sequence Accession NumbersThe GenBank™ accession numbers are U11054 and U21209 for the Sty5.6 and StyT cDNAs, respectively.RESULTSSequence Analysis of the Developmentally Induced Sty Transcripts Reveals IntronsNorthern blot analysis revealed that the L1210 cell line expressed three distinct species of Sty mRNA corresponding in size to the developmentally regulated mRNA species identified previously in P19 cells and other cell lines (data not shown, (1Howell B.W. Afar D.E.H. Lew J. Douville E.M.J. Icely P.L.E. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and Fig. 2). In order to determine if these transcripts encode different isoforms of the STY kinase, we cloned the larger of these mRNA species. Using size-selected mRNA isolated from L1210 cells, we prepared cDNAs from mRNA species larger than 1.8kb (see “Materials and Methods”). Our initial screen of 200,000 recombinants resulted in 18 positive clones, one of which (2.6 kb in size) was sequenced fully. This 2.6-kb cDNA clone contained regions of sequence identity with the Sty 1.8-kb embryonic transcript (hereafter referred to as Sty1.8), including the 5′ end, interspersed with regions of non-identity. The intervening sequences did not, however, maintain the open reading frame as they contained stop codons in all reading frames (see Fig. 1). Further analysis revealed 5′ and 3′ splice sites at the ends of the intervening regions suggesting the presence of intronic sequences within an incompletely spliced transcript. The 2.6-kb cDNA did not contain the entire predicted Sty open reading frame, but rather contained four exons (including an exon with the predicted initiating methionine), three complete introns (with 5′ and 3′ splice sites), and one partial intron (with a 5′ splice site). To determine from which mRNA species the cDNA had been cloned, Northern blots were probed with the cDNA regions encompassing individual introns (data not shown). The results of these experiments are depicted schematically in Fig. 2. Probes derived from intron A (IA), or intron B (IB), hybridized to the 5.6-kb and 3.2-kb transcripts (hereafter called Sty5.6 and Sty3.2, respectively), while probes from intron C (IC) and D (ID) hybridized to Sty5.6 but not Sty3.2. These data indicated that the 2.6-kb cDNA clone represented a partial 5′ clone of the Sty5.6 RNA species. Since probes corresponding to introns A and B hybridized to Sty3.2, it is likely that this mRNA species is also an incompletely spliced transcript. Thus, both the larger 5.6- and 3.2-kb transcripts contain intron sequences and arise as a result of incomplete and/or alternative splicing. The intron/exon boundaries of the 2.6-kb cDNA clone are indicated in Table 1.Figure 1:Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the Sty5.6 partial cDNA and StyT cDNA. The amino acid sequence is derived from that predicted from the Sty1.8 cDNA(1Howell B.W. Afar D.E.H. Lew J. Douville E.M.J. Icely P.L.E. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A, Sty5.6 partial cDNA. Predicted intron/exon boundaries are indicated in boldface. The alternatively spliced exon is underlined, and consensus amino acids found in kinase subdomains are highlighted and indicated by Roman numerals. Amino acids indicated by an asterisk are encoded by codons split between two adjacent exons. Exons (E) and introns (I) are labeled as follows: EA, nucleotides 1-456; IA, nucleotides 457-1326; EB, nucleotides 1327-1417; IB, nucleotides 1418-1811; EC, nucleotides 1812-1995; IC, nucleotides 1996-2082; ED, nucleotides 2083-2249; ID, nucleotides 2250-2572. B, Sty1.7 (StyT) cDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Sty 3.2- and Sty 5.6-kb Transcripts Are NuclearAlthough both Sty3.2 and Sty5.6 RNAs contained intron sequences, the possibility remained that these RNA species were capable of being translated into truncated STY polypeptides by the cytoplasmic translation machinery. To test this idea, RNA from NIH 3T3 cells was separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and analyzed by Northern blotting. All three Sty transcripts were found in the nuclear fraction, whereas only Sty1.8 was found in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the larger transcripts (Sty3.2 and Sty5.6) being nuclear, immature (incompletely spliced) transcripts. Fractionated HeLa cell RNA and L cell RNA showed the same nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning of Sty transcripts (data not shown).To determine whether Sty5.6 represented the primary transcript from the Sty gene, fragments of the Sty locus were isolated from a D3 embryonic stem cell genomic λDASHII library (see “Materials and Methods”). A fragment surrounding the predicted initiating methionine was cloned into the sequencing vector pGEM-4. Portions of this genomic fragment were sequenced using oligonucleotides residing in the Sty cDNA. Two introns were identified in addition to those found in Sty5.6, demonstrating that Sty5.6 is not the primary transcript but is an incompletely spliced RNA. The intron/exon boundaries and relative positions of these introns are indicated in Table 1.Sty Is Alternatively SplicedAlignment of the amino acid sequence of STY with that of the reported human homologue (hCLK(21Johnson K.W. Smith K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3402-3407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) using the Lipman-Pearson algorithm (22Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar) revealed very high homology (83% identity over 482 amino acid overlap). However, there is a stretch of 30 amino acids contained in STY that is absent within hCLK (Fig. 3A). Sequence analysis indicated that these 30 amino acids are encoded within the second exon (exon B) of the 2.6-kb cDNA clone (see Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:B). This suggested that exon B may be alternatively spliced. The Sty cDNA originally isolated (1Howell B.W. Afar D.E.H. Lew J. Douville E.M.J. Icely P.L.E. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) would encode the isoform containing exon B, whereas the hClk cDNA (21Johnson K.W. Smith K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3402-3407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would encode the isoform lacking this exon. Consistent with this idea, the Sty1.8 transcript often appears as a doublet upon Northern blotting suggesting the presence of a fourth transcript (data not shown, (1Howell B.W. Afar D.E.H. Lew J.

B, the nucleotide sequence of the intron/exon boundaries surrounding the alternatively spliced exon is shown between the predicted splicing products. Splicing in of exon B would result in production of full-length STY. Splicing out of exon B results in a frameshift which introduces a premature stop codon (tag, indicated by a period). The resulting protein (STYT) is truncated prior to the catalytic domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate this possibility, we performed reverse transcriptase coupled with PCR amplification (RT-PCR) to amplify the entire coding sequence of Sty (nucleotide position 7-1539, data not shown) from P19 cell-derived cDNA. Two DNA species were amplified, the sizes of which were consistent with alternative slicing of exon B (data not shown). To verify the identity of the PCR products, the DNA was isolated, reamplified, and subcloned into the pCRII vector. Sequencing revealed that the larger amplification product corresponded to full-length Sty, whereas the smaller lacked exon B (Fig. 1). This result was observed with cDNA derived from P19 cells (see P19 lane, Fig. 4) suggesting that the alternatively spliced transcript lacking exon B (Sty1.7) arises from a mRNA that co-migrates with the 1.8-kb transcript.Figure 4:RT-PCR analysis of Sty transcripts demonstrates alternative splicing. Oligonucleotide primers flanking exon B were used to amplify cDNA generated from adult mouse tissues or P19 EC cells as indicated above each lane or to amplify the Sty1.8 cDNA. PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The predicted product sizes of 543 bp (Sty) and 453 bp (StyT) are indicated on the left, and DNA marker sizes are shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of Sty1.7 and Sty1.8 was assayed by RT-PCR amplification of the region encompassing exon B from cDNA of several mouse tissues (Fig. 4). All tissues tested contained both Sty1.7 and Sty1.8 transcripts. A PCR product of approximately 1 kb in size was also reproducibly amplified from all tissues, the size of which is consistent with that of a splicing intermediate derived from Sty5.6 (data not shown).The Sty1.7 mRNA, generated by alternative splicing of exon B, should encode a protein homologous to the hCLK protein product. The protein product from the murine Sty1.7 transcript is predicted to be truncated and catalytically inactive (we have termed this product STYT for truncated STY) (see Fig. 3B). However, the protein product of hClk, which lacks exon B, is predicted to be catalytically active. This apparent contradiction suggested that either the sequence encompassing exon B is absent in the human genome and that in its absence the gene has evolved to maintain a catalytically active molecule or, alternatively, the hClk cDNA is the homologue of Sty1.7 and should encode a truncated molecule. To investigate this further, a human liver cDNA library (gift of Dr. D. A. Gray) was screened with a full-length Sty cDNA probe. From an initial screening of 200,000 recombinants, 30 clones were identified. Of these, 10 were picked at random and analyzed by PCR to determine if they contained the exon A-exon C region. One positive clone was analyzed further, and the sequence of this boundary indicated that it was the human homologue of Sty1.7 and would encode a truncated protein product (data not shown). The human cDNA, as published by Johnson and Smith(21Johnson K.W. Smith K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3402-3407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contains an additional G residue at this boundary which would maintain the open reading frame through the catalytic domain.

Concurrent mutation of all six of the cytoplasmic tyrosines present in the beta chain markedly inhibited IL-2-induced growth signaling in both pro-B and T cell lines. Growth signaling in a pro-B cell line was substantially reconstituted when either of the two distal tyrosines (Tyr-392, Tyr-510) was selectively restored in the tyrosine-negative beta mutant, whereas reconstitution of the proximal tyrosines (Tyr-338, Tyr-355, Tyr-358, Tyr-361) did not restore this signaling function. Furthermore, at least one of the two cytoplasmic tyrosines that is required for beta chain function was found to serve as a phosphate acceptor site upon induction with IL-2. Studies employing a chimeric receptor system revealed that tyrosine residues of the beta chain likewise were important for growth signaling in T cells. In contrast, although the gamma c subunits is a target for tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo, concurrent substitution of all four cytoplasmic tyrosines of this chain produced no significant effect on growth signaling by chimeric IL-2 receptors. However, deletion of either the Box 1, Box 2, or intervening (V-Box) regions of gamma c abrogated receptor function. Therefore, tyrosine residues of beta but not of gamma c appear to play a pivotal role in regulating growth signal transduction through the IL-2 receptor, either by influencing cytoplasmic domain folding or by serving as sites for phosphorylation and subsequent association with signaling intermediates. These findings thus highlight a fundamental difference in the structural requirements for IL-2R beta and gamma c in receptor-mediated signal transduction."

The general distribution of trans-splicing and its origin in metazoa is currently not known. Furthermore, both the origin of early metazoan groups and the phylogenetic relationships between flatworms, nematodes, and other early invertebrates have been difficult to delineate(12Raff R.A.

Trans-splicing is of particular interest in flatworms (Phylum Platyhelminthes) as these metazoa may represent the earliest bilateral animals, and one possible evolutionary tree places a flatworm-like ancestor as the progenitor of a number of other early invertebrate groups(12Raff R.A.

We have recently shown that trans-splicing is present in diverse trematode flatworms and in a predominantly free-living group generally considered to represent primitive flatworms(14Davis R.E.

Hardwick, manuscript in preparation. This suggests that spliced leader addition may have been present in the flatworm progenitor and in the ancestors of parasitic flatworms. The primary function(s) of most trans-splicing in metazoa remains unknown. We have analyzed several characteristics of spliced leader addition in the flatworm Schistosoma mansoni to explore the biological significance of trans-splicing in flatworms and to provide a comparative metazoan perspective. We previously noted that not all mRNAs acquire the spliced leader in schistosomes(11Rajkovic A. Davis R.E. Simonsen J.N. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified and partially characterized 30 mRNAs and four genes that are trans-spliced in S. mansoni to increase our understanding of the molecular characteristics and general properties of trans-splicing in flatworms. The mRNAs were examined to determine 1) if there are any discernable patterns in the proteins they encode, 2) if mRNAs in a particular pathway are trans-spliced as a group, 3) if any other general characteristics of trans-spliced mRNAs were evident, and 4) if the AUG conserved at the 3′ end of all flatworm SLs (11Rajkovic A.

Genes coding for trans-spliced mRNAs were analyzed to investigate the general organization of these genes and for conserved elements associated with the trans-splice acceptor sites that might distinguish these sites from cis-splice acceptor sites or facilitate bringing the SL RNA and pre-mRNA substrates together for trans-splicing. Finally, the expression of the SL RNA and several trans-spliced mRNAs was also examined by in situ hybridization in adult worms to determine if there is any possible sex, tissue, or cell specificity in trans-splicing. Our results described herein suggest that the functional significance of flatworm trans-splicing does not appear to be correlated with specific types of mRNAs or the proteins they encode nor with restricted expression of the SL RNA to specific cells, tissues, or sex. This suggests that the functional significance of trans-splicing in flatworms is more likely associated either with properties conferred on recipient mRNAs by addition of the spliced leader or related to the characteristics of transcription and the primary transcripts of trans-spliced genes.

Genomics. 1994; 19: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Not all mRNAs in S. mansoni undergo trans-splicing, and thus only a subset of mRNAs acquire the SL sequence(11Rajkovic A.

Available evidence suggests that a low percentage of schistosome mRNAs are trans-spliced based on the following: 1) only one of five glycolytic mRNAs we examined is trans-spliced (see below), 2) the frequency of trans-splicing among mRNAs and their genes whose 5′ ends have been characterized and reported in the literature or data bases, 3) analysis of several types of schistosome cDNA libraries, and 4) our comparison of SL-enriched and 5′-RACE cDNA libraries constructed for schistosomes with similar libraries constructed for Fasiola hepatica(14Davis R.E.

In contrast, all mRNAs in trypanosomes (33Walder J.A. Eder P.S. Engman D.M. Brentano S.T. Walder R.Y. Knutzon D.S. Dorfman D.M. Donelson J.E. Science. 1986; 233: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and a large percentage, 70-90%, of nematode mRNAs (C. elegans ~70% and Ascaris ~80-90%) (3Nilsen T.W. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) are thought to be trans-spliced. Because only a relatively small subset of mRNAs appears to acquire the spliced leader in schistosomes, we identified and characterized trans-spliced mRNAs and several of their genes as one approach to determine if their type or organization could provide information on the potential function(s) and regulation of trans-splicing in flatworms. We used several approaches to construct cDNA libraries enriched for mRNAs with spliced leaders and isolated and characterized portions of 30 trans-spliced mRNAs (see “Materials and Methods”). These cDNAs were analyzed to determine if there are any discernable patterns in the type of computer-predicted proteins encoded as wall as the general sequence or secondary structure characteristics of these mRNAs. cDNAs were also examined to determine if addition of the SL to mRNAs was required to provide the initiator methionine for open reading frames (ORFs) or contributed some other property to the 5′ ends of the mRNAs. Representative cDNAs were selected from each of the libraries and analyzed either by primer extension analysis or direct sequencing of 5′-RACE products to provide independent confirmation that the cDNAs represented mRNAs with 5′-terminal SLs. From these analyses we estimated that at least 80% of the clones isolated from the SL-enriched libraries represent mRNAs with 5′-terminal spliced leaders. Open reading frames initiated by methionine were identified by computer-assisted translation of the cDNAs. Both the nucleotide and protein sequences were compared with known sequences in data bases using the BLAST (B21819 and Blastx), FASTA, MPsrch, and BLOCKS algorithms to identify significant similarities with known sequences. Several parameter matrices were used for these analyses as described(35Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Gish W. Wootton J.C. Nature Genet. 1994; 6: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Eight of the 30 trans-spliced mRNAs encoded proteins which were homologous to protein sequences or conceptual translations in data bases. These significant matches included the glycolytic enzyme enolase, a homolog of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin, a homolog of the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family (carbonyl reductase - NADPH), cyclophilin, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein β subunit-like), and an unidentified open reading frame in C. elegans and within a bacterial operon. We had identified trans-splicing previously in the S. mansoni mRNA encoding HMG-CoA reductase(11Rajkovic A. Davis R.E. Simonsen J.N. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Rajkovic A. Simonsen J.N. Davis R.E. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8217-8221Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and these sequences were also used in our study. No identifiable patterns are evident in this set of proteins. Additional characterization of all the trans-spliced cDNAs, including predicted protein properties and structure, characteristics of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, and RNA secondary structures did not identify any apparent patterns in trans-spliced mRNAs or their encoded proteins. The 3′-terminal nucleotides of all flatworm SLs1 constitute a potential translation initiator methionine (Table 1). Using 60 non-trans-spliced schistosome mRNAs derived from nucleic acid data bases, we generated a preliminary S. mansoni translation initiation consensus Aanna(a/u)AaaAUGncna described in Table 2. Comparison of this initiation consensus with the sequence context of the SL AUG shows that they differ significantly, and that the adenine at the −3 position, known to be important in other organisms, is absent in the SL. The longest ORFs in the trans-spliced S. mansoni mRNAs examined are rarely initiated by the SL AUG indicating that trans-splicing does not typically serve to provide an essential AUG. Thus, it seems unlikely that the primary function of spliced leader addition in schistosomes is to provide an initiator methionine for ORFs. However, two mRNAs are predicted to be initiated by the SL AUG based on conceptual translation. In these two mRNAs, SL1-6 (950+ bases) and SL1-17 (1150 bases), the ORFs extend at least 350 bases before the next in-frame AUG is present. One of the conceptual translations of these mRNAs has similarity with a motif in G protein β subunit-like proteins (SL1-17). Demonstration of the existence of proteins initiated by the SL AUGs in schistosomes requires further study. In the enolase mRNA, the SL AUG is in-frame and within 10 nucleotides of a second downstream AUG that exhibits a more typical eukaryotic translation initiation context. In other mRNAs, the SL contributes an upstream and out-of-frame AUG. The mean distance between the SL AUG and the predicted initiator AUG for the dominant ORF was 50 ± 50 (S.D.) nucleotides with a typical range of 6-150 (two mRNAs with 5′-untranslated regions over 500 bases were excluded from this analysis). Finally, computer-generated RNA secondary structure predictions for the 5′ ends of trans-spliced mRNAs (5′ terminus to 100 bases 3′ of the initiator methionine) did not show any consistent or common structural motifs in recipient mRNAs.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab One of the isolated trans-spliced schistosome mRNAs is predicted to encode the glycolytic enzyme enolase. Schistosomes exhibit an extremely high rate of glycolysis. Their energy metabolism is primarily homolactate fermentation, and the worms can consume glucose equivalent to 20% of their dry weight/h(36Bueding E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1950; 33: 475-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37Tielens A.G.M. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 346-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the high rate of glycolysis might be facilitated by trans-splicing of glycolytic mRNAs as a group. SL addition might then contribute to coordinate expression, enhanced translation, or subcellular localization of glycolytic mRNAs. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed several other glycolytic mRNAs for the presence of spliced leaders and investigated whether proteins in a common pathway might be derived from trans-spliced mRNAs. We used direct sequencing of 5′-RACE products to characterize the 5′-terminal sequences of the mRNAs coding for four other schistosome glycolytic enzymes (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, aldolase, and phosphofructokinase). Northern blot hybridization with probes derived from these 5′-terminal sequences was then used to determine if the mRNAs are trans-spliced. Control experiments on well characterized schistosome mRNAs and previous studies2 indicate that our 5′-RACE conditions consistently generate products that extend to the 5′ termini of mRNAs(14Davis R.E.

Shoemaker C.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). None of these four other glycolytic enzyme mRNAs exhibited the schistosome spliced leader nor did they have any 5′-terminal sequences in common (the TPI analysis was conducted simultaneously with these mRNAs and described previously(17Reis dos M.G. Davis R.E. Singh H. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). Northern blot hybridizations using antisense oligonucleotides to the 5′ termini of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase, and phosphofructokinase demonstrated hybridization only to discrete mRNAs of the predicted size for the corresponding eukaryotic glycolytic mRNA and not to a small RNA or a smear as would be expected if the 5′ terminus of the mRNA were a spliced leader. These data indicate that these other glycolytic enzyme mRNAs are not trans-spliced and that glycolytic mRNAs do not appear to be trans-spliced as a group in schistosomes. Genomic clones containing the trans-splice acceptor regions of several mRNAs processed by spliced leader addition were isolated and analyzed. The isolation of genomic clones corresponding to HMG-CoA reductase was described previously(11Rajkovic A. Davis R.E. Simonsen J.N. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two genes, enolase and L11, were sequenced in their entirety (Fig. 1), whereas only 5′ regions of synaptobrevin (exons 2-4 and ~400 bases upstream) and HMG-CoA reductase (exons 2-4 and ~400 bases of upstream) were characterized (Fig. 1). The L11 gene has no significant similarity with current sequences in data bases. All four genes appear to be single copy genes based on analysis of their corresponding genomic clones, Southern blots, and genomic titrations. General characteristics of all four genes include the presence of introns and both variable exon and intron size. In the L11 gene, intron sizes are all quite small including 31, 32, and 34 nucleotide introns, and an exon is present that is only 34 nucleotides. Small exons and introns can also be found in the other trans-spliced genes (Fig. 1) and have previously been described in several nontrans-spliced schistosome genes(15Davis R.E. Davis A.H.

We found that RPA interacts with xeroderma pigmentosum group A complementing protein (XPAC), a protein that specifically recognizes UV-damaged DNA. We examined the effect of this XPAC-RPA interaction on in vitro simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication catalyzed by the monopolymerase system. XPAC inhibited SV40 DNA replication in vitro, and this inhibition was reversed by the addition of RPA but not by the addition of DNA polymerase α-primase complex, SV40 large tumor antigen, or topoisomerase I. This inhibition did not result from an interaction between XPAC and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), or from competition between RPA and XPAC for DNA binding, because XPAC does not show any ssDNA binding activity and, in fact, stimulates RPA's ssDNA binding activity. Furthermore, XPAC inhibited DNA polymerase α activity in the presence of RPA but not in RPA's absence.

A plasmid pET-12a-UK(1-411)-PAP was also produced by transferring the expression unit between the NdeI and HindIII sites from pET-14b-UK(1-411)-PAP to the corresponding sites of pET-12a; this plasmid encodes the same protein except that it lacks the 20-amino acid polyhistidine-containing sequence present at the N terminus of the pET-14b product. Regions around the cloning sites in the final vectors were resequenced to verify that no undesired mutations had been inadvertently introduced. GenBank™ reference sequences were M18366 for the annexin V cDNA and M15476 for the prourokinase cDNA. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for large-scale expression. Cells were grown at 37°C with shaking in 2% LB broth base (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. When the turbidity (OD600) reached 0.4-0.5, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside was added to 1 mM, and growth was continued for 2 h; the final OD was about 1. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to give a pellet with wet weight of about 2 g per liter of culture, and stored frozen at −20°C. The inclusion body fraction was prepared according to Nagai and Thogersen (29Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) from the cells obtained from 3 liters of culture. The inclusion body fraction, which contained chimera with about 70% purity, was suspended in 5 ml of 8 M urea, 0.5 M NH4Cl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and shaken for 4 h at room temperature. Insoluble materials were then removed by centrifugation. The 82K chimera was purified as follows. The 8 M urea extract was applied to a Sephacryl S-400 gel filtration column (2.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 5 M urea, 0.5 M NH4Cl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The fractions that contained the chimera (based on SDS-PAGE) were pooled and stored frozen after adding 2-mercaptoethanol to 0.1 M. The sample was dialyzed overnight against 10 volumes of 5 M urea, 0.5 M NH4Cl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, to reduce 2-mercaptoethanol to 10 mM. Oxygen was removed from this buffer by degassing (10 min) followed by nitrogen flush (5 min), and the flask was sealed with parafilm during dialysis. Then, the sample was added dropwise to 100 volumes of 2 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NH4Cl, 10 mM benzamidine-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1.25 mM reduced glutathione, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione (protein concentration, ~0.02 mg/ml) and stirred slowly for 24 h at 4°C. Oxygen was removed from this buffer, and the flask was sealed as above. After 24 h, oxidized glutathione was added at 0.5 mM (total 1 mM), and the sample was stirred overnight open to the atmosphere. After Tween-20 (Bio-Rad) was added to the sample at 0.01%, it was extensively dialyzed against 12 volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with three buffer changes. After addition of Tween-20 to 0.01%, the sample was concentrated 60-fold by ultrafiltration with an Amicon XM-50 membrane. Ten ml of the sample was applied to an AP-1 column (Waters) packed with Protein-Pak DEAE 15HR, which was connected to a Waters advanced protein purification system, model 650E. The column was equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a salt gradient from 0 to 0.6 M in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions were assayed for prourokinase and anticoagulant activities as described below. Most of the unfolded proteins were found in nonadsorbed fractions, and the folded protein was eluted with a single peak at a salt concentration about 0.3 M. The yield of folded chimera was about 0.25 mg/liter of culture, or about 0.125 mg/g E. coli paste. To detect prourokinase, samples from column fractions (50 μl) were placed onto a microtiter plate with 1 μl of plasmin (3 units/ml, Sigma) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Five μl of aprotinin (1 mg/ml, gift from Novo) were added to inactivate plasmin, followed by 20 μl of 20 mM S-2444; absorbance at 405 nm was measured after a 20-min incubation at room temperature. The anticoagulant activity was determined with a partial thromboplastin time assay as described earlier(25Funakoshi T. Heimark R.L. Hendrickson L.E. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The 69K chimera was purified as follows. The unfolded protein was isolated from the 8 M urea extract of inclusion bodies by affinity chromatography on chelating Sepharose according to a manufacturer's protocol (His-bind buffer kit; Novagen, Madison, WI) except that all buffers contained 5 M urea. The extract was dialyzed overnight against binding buffer and applied to a chelating Sepharose column (2 ml). After the column was washed with 10 ml of wash buffer, the 69K protein was eluted with elution buffer. This sample (1 ml) was mixed with 10 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 6 M urea, 0.5 M NH4Cl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M β-mercaptoethanol and left 4 h at room temperature. The sample was then dialyzed at 4°C overnight successively against 250 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.5 M NH4Cl, 10 mM benzamidine, 1 mM EDTA containing different concentrations of urea and reducing or oxidizing reagents: first, 6 M urea; second, 2 M urea and 0.5 mM cysteine; third, 2 M urea; fourth, 2 M urea and 1 mM oxidized glutathione; fifth, 1 M urea and 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione. Finally it was dialyzed against 1 liter of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mM NaCl with one buffer change. The sample was then applied to the DEAE column and eluted as described above, with the 69K protein eluting at a slightly lower salt concentration. The affinity of chimeras for cell membranes containing exposed PS was determined by a modification of the binding assay of Tait and Gibson(30Tait J.F. Gibson D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar), using a commercial preparation of preserved blood in which the erythrocytes have high levels of exposed PS. Proteins to be tested were incubated at various concentrations with 5 nM125I-annexin V (30Tait J.F. Gibson D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar) and 5.3 × 106 erythocytes/ml in the presence of 2.5 mM calcium for 15 min at 37°C; the assay buffer consisted of 10 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 136 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM glucose, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty-acid free; Sigma). Bound and free ligand were then separated by centrifugation through a silicone-oil barrier as described previously. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 5 mM EDTA and was less than 1% of total binding. Where necessary, chimeras were first activated by incubation with 1 μg/ml plasmin for 60 min at 37°C. Samples were then added to a solution of chromogenic substrate S-2444 (1 mM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-80 in a final volume of 100 μl and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was then stopped with 500 μl of 10% acetic acid, and the absorbance was read against a substrate blank. Activity (expressed as equivalent concentration of urokinase) was calculated from a standard curve prepared using human urokinase (Green Cross), which was linear from 0 to 2.5 μg/ml. Control experiments showed that under these conditions the traces of plasmin present from the activation reaction had a negligible effect on the observed absorbance changes. Chimeras were first activated by incubation with 1 μg/ml plasmin for 60 min at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-80. The amount of urokinase activity generated was then quantitated by S-2444 assay as described above. Urokinase or activated chimera was then added at 1.85 nM final concentration to plasminogen (0-27 μM) at room temperature in the same buffer. Aliquots were then taken at 1, 2, and 3 min and diluted 25-fold at room temperature in the same buffer containing 0.5 mM of chromogenic substrate S-2251. The rate of absorbance change was measured over a 2-min period after dilution; under these conditions the rate of substrate hydrolysis was linear with time, indicating that no new plasmin was being generated during the S-2251 assay. The amount of plasmin present was determined by reference to a standard curve. The rate of plasmin generation at each concentration of plasminogen was then determined graphically from the values of plasmin present at 1, 2, and 3 min after addition of the activator to the plasminogen. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data to a standard Michaelis-Menten function by nonlinear least-squares analysis (RS/1 software, Bolt-Beranek-Newman, Cambridge, MA). Uncertainties of the parameters are given as standard deviations estimated by the curve-fitting program. Venous blood was drawn from healthy volunteer donors into 0.1 volume of 109 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.5, and platelet-rich plasma prepared by centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 450 × g; the platelet count ranged from 250,000 to 450,000/μl, depending on the donor. Individual clots were then formed from 100 μl of platelet-rich plasma by adding calcium chloride (10 mM), human thrombin (10 units/ml), and 125I-fibrinogen (0.8 μg/ml, 1 μCi/μg) and incubating for 10 min at room temperature in 12 × 75-mm glass test tubes. Clots were then washed for 5 min at room temperature in 200 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, transferred to fresh glass tubes, and total radioactivity present was determined. Clot lysis was then assayed by adding the urokinase or chimera (preactivated with plasmin as described above) at a concentration of 1.85 nM (determined by amidolytic assay) to the preformed clot in 0.4 ml of a solution containing 0.2 mg/ml plasminogen, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2. The plasminogen concentration was comparable to its normal level in human plasma; lysis was minimal in the absence of added plasminogen. The sample was incubated at room temperature; it was periodically mixed, and 20-μl aliquots were withdrawn to determine the amount of radioactivity released from the clot. Clot lysis was expressed as percentage of soluble radioactivity, corrected for the change in volume over the course of the experiment. Concentrations of refolded immunoreactive chimeras were determined by competitive fluorescence polarization immunoassay on a TDx Analyzer (Abbott Laboratories). Assays were performed at 34°C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 nM fluorescein-annexin V(14Tait J.F. Gibson D. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7944-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 200 nM of an IgG fraction of rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against placental annexin V, and placental annexin V as the standard. Western blotting was performed with the same polyclonal antiserum against annexin V, with detection based on alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated antibody. SDS-PAGE was performed with a Laemmli system with 12.5% gels; where necessary, samples were concentrated prior to electrophoresis with Microcon-30 concentrators (Amicon). Vectors were designed to produce two chimeras (Fig. 1). One chimera (82K) contains full-length prourokinase at the N terminus. The second chimera (69K) contains a truncated form of prourokinase beginning at amino acid 144; this derivative, although smaller than the full-length prourokinase, retains the full serine-protease domain as well as the plasmin activation site at Lys-158-Ile-159(24Holmes W.E. Pennica D. Blaber M. Rey M.W. Guenzler W.A. Steffens G.J. Heyneker H.L. Bio/Technology. 1985; 3: 923-929Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). At the C terminus, both chimeras contain the full annexin V sequence (amino acids 1-320, including initiator Met), separated from the prourokinase by a single Glu residue. The 69K chimera also has a 20-amino acid N-terminal extension with a polyhistidine sequence for use in purification by metal-ion-dependent affinity chromatography. The expression vectors included a provision for optional insertion of a spacer sequence at the unique XhoI site between the two protein units, although so far we have not used this feature because subsequent work showed no evidence for steric interference between the two functional protein units. Both expression constructs are placed in one of the pET series of vectors(31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), allowing for high level expression in E. coli under control of the T7 promoter. We chose to express the chimeras cytoplasmically in E. coli since previous work has shown that both prourokinase (32Winkler M.E. Blaber M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4041-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Orsini G. Brandazza A. Sarmientos P. Molinari A. Lansen J. Cauet G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and annexin V (34Iwasaki A. Suda M. Nakao H. Nagoya T. Saino Y. Arai K. Mizoguchi T. Sato F. Yoshizaki H. Hirata M. Miyata T. Shidara Y. Murata M. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) can be produced by this method. When expression was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” Western blot analysis indicated that greater than 95% of the 82K chimera was present in single-chain form in the insoluble fraction after cell lysis, indicating that it was being packaged in inclusion bodies. The initial yield of chimera was approximately 10-25 mg/liter of culture, based on Western blot analysis. The inclusion body fraction was therefore isolated and subjected to a variety of denaturation and refolding procedures. We varied the denaturant (urea or guanidine), its rate of removal, the pH, the salt concentration, the reducing agent (2-mercaptoethanol or glutathione), the presence or absence of protein-disulfide isomerase, and the protein concentration during refolding. The yield of renatured material was then determined by S-2444 assay and by solution-phase immunoassay for native annexin V; yields of active protein ranged from about 0.1 to 1 mg/liter of culture prior to purification, depending on the procedure followed. The yield of the 69K chimera after refolding was about 2-fold lower. No method gave a high absolute yield of active chimera (see “Discussion”). Once refolding had been optimized, the chimeric proteins were then purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified chimeras showed that both proteins were present in single-chain form, and their observed molecular weights were consistent with calculated values (Fig. 2). The purity of the 69K chimera was less than that of the 82K chimera due to lower initial yields and greater losses during refolding and purification. The affinity of the chimeras for cell membranes with exposed PS was determined by competition assay against 125I-annexin V (Fig. 3). Both chimeras were able to fully displace the 125I-annexin V with affinities identical to native annexin V, indicating that the membrane-binding activity of the annexin V moiety was fully retained in the chimeric proteins. The amidolytic activity of the chimeras before and after activation with plasmin was measured on substrate S-2444. The chimeras had virtually no amidolytic activity prior to activation with plasmin, consistent with the results of SDS-PAGE analysis indicating that both chimeras were present in proenzyme (single-chain) form. However, after activation with plasmin, the amidolytic activity of the chimeras increased approximately 100-fold. After activation with plasmin, the specific amidolytic activity of the 82K chimera was 9.5 ± 1.0 IU/pmol, while the 69K chimera had a specific activity of 4.9 ± 1.6 IU/pmol. These values are comparable to the specific activity of urokinase (9 IU/pmol). The chimeras were then tested on their intended physiological substrate, plasminogen (Fig. 4). Activation of plasminogen followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and both chimeras fully retained the ability to activate plasminogen compared to natural urokinase. In fact, there was a trend to lower Km values, indicating that the chimeras may have a slightly higher affinity for plasminogen than urokinase alone. Vmax values were comparable (Table 1). Thus, the presence of the annexin V moiety does not hinder the interaction of the urokinase moiety with its substrate, plasminogen.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The two chimeras were assayed for their ability to lyse a clot formed from human platelet-rich plasma in vitro (Fig. 5). Both the rate and extent of clot lysis were similar to urokinase, indicating that both chimeras were also able to activate plasminogen and promote clot lysis in a platelet-containing thrombus. This study shows the feasibility of producing hybrid thrombolytic agents in which annexin V provides the thrombus-targeting component. We have constructed two chimeric plasminogen activators that contain either full-length or truncated prourokinase attached to a membrane-targeting component, annexin V. In vitro assays show that these molecules fully retain the component activities of the parent molecules, i.e. membrane binding, activation of plasminogen, and in vitro fibrinolysis. This study and our related work using chemical conjugation procedures 2K. Tanaka, K. Einaga, H. Tsuchiyama, J. F. Tait, and K. Fujikawa, manuscript submitted for publication. provide the first example of the use of annexin V as an agent to target chimeric proteins to cell membranes that are rich in exposed PS, such as those on activated platelets. Our results indicate that the presence of the annexin V moiety does not prevent activation of the prourokinase moiety by plasmin, or decrease the activity of the urokinase moiety toward its physiological substrate, plasminogen. Likewise, the attachment of the large prourokinase moiety at the N terminus of the annexin V does not alter its affinity for cell membranes. This is consistent with the expectations used to design the chimera: structural evidence shows that the N terminus of annexin V is located at the surface of the protein and faces away from the membrane-binding side of the molecule(35Huber R. Berendes R. Burger A. Schneider M. Karshikov A. Luecke H. Romisch J. Paques E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 683-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 36Concha N.O. Head J.F.

Biol. 1994; 238: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus the two major functional units of the chimera are still able to act independently when attached to each other. We also saw no evidence that the annexin V moiety was degraded by plasmin or urokinase; this was expected from previous work, which has shown that native annexin V has a compact structure that is resistant to proteolysis. 3J. F. Tait and K. Fujikawa, unpublished observations. The functional properties of the 82K and the 69K chimeras appear to be equivalent in the assays tested so far. Thus, both molecules are candidates for further testing in vivo in animal models of clot lysis. The smaller size of the 69K chimera might be advantageous in facilitating penetration into the thrombus. However, this molecule was somewhat harder to produce and purify than the 82K chimera, perhaps because absence of the N-terminal 143 amino acids of prourokinase decreases protein stability. Despite initial production of relatively large amounts of insoluble protein after expression of the 82K chimera was induced, the final yield of folded, soluble, monomeric protein was rather low. The low yield probably reflects the difficulty of forming all the correct disulfide bonds in the serine-protease domain of the prourokinase moiety, since annexin V has no disulfide bonds. Consistent with this view, yields were lower for the 69K chimera, which retains the serine-protease domain but lacks the first 144 amino acids of prourokinase. Also, presence of the N-terminal 20-residue polyhistidine sequence did not affect yields, since removing it from the construct used to express the 82K chimera did not improve yield. Previous studies have also reported moderately low yields of active prourokinase (~0.15-0.3 mg of prourokinase per g of E. coli paste) after refolding of insoluble E. coli-derived material(32Winkler M.E. Blaber M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4041-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Orsini G. Brandazza A. Sarmientos P. Molinari A. Lansen J. Cauet G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We were not able to achieve production levels of active chimera as high as the levels reported for prourokinase alone. It is possible that presence of the annexin V moiety may further reduce the efficiency of folding and/or disulfide bond formation in the prourokinase moiety. Thus, while the present expression system produces adequate amounts of protein for in vitro characterization, production of large amounts of protein for animal studies will probably require an alternative expression host such as yeast or mammalian cells with naturally catalyzed disulfide bond formation, or production via chemical conjugation of separately produced proteins. The fact that the chimeras were similar to urokinase when tested for clot lysis activity in vitro (Fig. 5) might raise doubts about the practical value of such chimeras for potential clinical use. However, it is difficult to predict the in vivo potency of modified plasminogen activators from in vitro data, since factors such as blood flow past the thrombus and plasma clearance rate can greatly affect the results compared those obtained in static test-tube assays. In several instances, conjugates of urokinase with antiplatelet or antifibrin antibodies showed much higher in vivo potency than would be predicted from their in vitro potency(7Bode C. Runge M.S. Schonermark S. Eberle T. Newell J.B. Kubler W. Haber E. Circulation. 1990; 81: 1974-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Holvoet P. Laroche Y. Stassen J.M. Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B.

Plow E.F. Collen D. Blood. 1991; 78: 1005-1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But more importantly, preliminary animal studies with an annexin V-urokinase conjugate produced by chemical conjugation indicate that it has 3-4-fold higher in vivo thrombolytic potency than urokinase alone.2 Thus, although further animal studies will be needed to evaluate the efficacy of annexin V-prourokinase chimeras, these initial results, together with previous results showing accumulation of annexin V in thrombi in vivo(21Tait J.F.

Reno J.M. Cerqueira M.D. Baskin D.G. Tait J.F. Circulation. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), provide grounds for optimism that annexin V may be useful for targeting thrombolytic agents in vivo. Extracellular exposure of PS has long been recognized as an integral part of the platelet procoagulant response (11Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 736: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 12Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F.A. Blood Rev. 1991; 5: 147-154Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and may also be involved in augmenting the procoagulant potential of certain tumors (38Rao L.V. Tait J.F. Hoang A.D. Thromb. Res. 1992; 67: 517-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39Sugimura M. Donato R. Kakkar V.V. Scully M.F. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 365-373PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, increased exposure of PS has also been implicated in other physiological events, such as marking oxidatively damaged (40Sambrano G.R. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, annexin V may have broader uses as a targeting agent beyond the field of blood coagulation wherever diagnostic or therapeutic agents need to be targeted to cells undergoing events that increase extracellular exposure of PS.

A cDNA library prepared from HT-29-inosine cells was screened with a series of subtracted cDNA probes to identify proteins that regulate proliferation/differentiation along the crypt-villus axis. A cDNA was recovered that encodes a 202-amino acid protein with four predicted membrane spanning domains and two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. Levels of this new member of the superfamily of tetraspan membrane proteins (TMPs) increase dramatically as nondividing epithelial cells exit the proliferative compartment of the crypt-villus unit and migrate onto the villus.

Three sets of observations indicate that in the appropriate cellular context, intestinal and liver (il)-TMP can mediate density-associated inhibition of proliferation. (i) Accumulation of il-TMP glycoforms precedes terminal differentiation of HT-29-inosine cells and occurs as they undergo density-dependent cessation of growth. il-TMP levels are lower and glycosylation less extensive in HT-29-glucose cells, which do not undergo growth arrest at confluence. (ii) HeLa cells normally do not produce il-TMP. Forced expression of il-TMP inhibits proliferation as cells approach confluence. The extent of il-TMP glycosylation in the transfected cells is similar to that observed in HT-29-inosine cells and greater than in HT-29-glucose cells. (iii) SW480 cells are derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma and do not express il-TMP. Like nontransfected HeLa cells, they do not stop dividing at confluence, whether grown in medium containing glucose or inosine. Expression of il-TMP has no effect on the growth properties of SW480 cells. The extent of il-TMP glycosylation in SW480-glucose cells is similar to that noted in HT-29-glucose cells, lending further support to the notion that il-TMP's activity is related to its state of N-glycosylation.

(iii) SW480 cells are derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma and do not express il-TMP. Like nontransfected HeLa cells, they do not stop dividing at confluence, whether grown in medium containing glucose or inosine. Expression of il-TMP has no effect on the growth properties of SW480 cells. The extent of il-TMP glycosylation in SW480-glucose cells is similar to that noted in HT-29-glucose cells, lending further support to the notion that il-TMP's activity is related to its state of N-glycosylation. The lifespan of an epithelial cell encompasses a series of decisions. The cell must decide when to proliferate, to commit to a specific cell lineage, to terminally differentiate, and/or to undergo a programmed death. In the small intestine, proliferation, differentiation, and death programs are expressed along a geographically well defined pathway that extends from the crypt of Lieberkühn to the villus' apical extrusion zone(1Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The mouse and human intestinal epithelium are continuously and rapidly renewed (2Wright N.A. Irwin M. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1982; 15: 595-609PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kellett M. Potten C.S. Rew D.A. Epith. Cell Biol. 1992; 1: 147-155PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the crypt-villus axis represents a model of perpetual development in mammals and provides an opportunity to examine the molecular mechanisms that regulate decision making in epithelial cells. Most of what is known about intestinal epithelial renewal comes from studies of the mouse. The mouse small intestinal epithelium contains four principal terminally differentiated cell types. Absorptive enterocytes comprise >80% of its cells(4Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Members of the mucus-producing goblet and enteroendocrine cell lineages exhibit remarkable variations in their differentiation programs as a function of their location along the crypt-villus and duodenal-ileal axes (see, e.g., (5Roth K.A. Hertz J.M. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1791-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Aiken K.D. Kisslinger J.A. Roth K.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 201: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Falk P. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G987-G1003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Paneth cells secrete a variety of anti-microbial peptides, digestive enzymes, and growth factors(8Bry L. Falk P. Huttner K. Ouellette A. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10335-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These epithelial lineages arise from a multipotent stem cell located near the base of each crypt. Descendants of active multipotent stem cell(s) undergo several rounds of cell division in the mid-portion of each crypt(9Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Development. 1990; 110: 1001-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enterocytes, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells undergo terminal differentiation as they cease proliferating and migrate in vertical coherent bands from the crypt to the apex of a surrounding villus(10Schmidt G.H. Wilkinson M.M. Ponder B.A.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells are either phagocytosed or exfoliated into the intestinal lumen at the villus tip. Differentiation and removal is completed in 2-5 days depending upon the lineage and the location of crypt-villus units along the duodenal-to-ileal axis(2Wright N.A. Irwin M. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1982; 15: 595-609PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 11Cheng H. Am. J.

Members of the Paneth cell lineage complete their differentiation program as they migrate downward to the base of each small intestine crypt where they reside for several weeks(15Cheng H. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 521-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Given the spatial complexities of this epithelium, most analyses of the regulation of its proliferation and differentiation programs have used in vivo models (see, e.g., Refs. 1, 16, and 17). However, in vitro models would be useful for initially identifying gene products that may regulate these processes. HT-29 cells are derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma (18Fogh J. Trempe G. Fogh J. Human Tumor Cells in Vitro. Plenum Press, New York1975: 115-159Crossref Google Scholar) and represent one such model. If cultured in standard medium containing 25 mM glucose, they proliferate even after reaching confluence and do not produce proteins synthesized by terminally differentiated intestinal epithelial cells in vivo(19Pinto M. Appay M.-D. Simon-Assmann P. Chevalier G. Dracopoli N. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1982; 44: 193-196Google Scholar). If HT-29 cells are cultured in the absence of glucose, using galactose (19Pinto M. Appay M.-D. Simon-Assmann P. Chevalier G. Dracopoli N. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1982; 44: 193-196Google Scholar) or inosine (20Trugnan G. Rousset M. Chantret I. Barbat A. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Wice B.M. Trugnan G. Pinto M. Rousset M. Chevalier G. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 139-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the carbon source, they cease to proliferate once they reach confluence. If maintained in this confluent state for 10-14 days, most of the quiescent cells differentiate into enterocytes; they become polarized, form tight junctions, and elaborate an apical brush border membrane containing a variety of hydrolases(19Pinto M. Appay M.-D. Simon-Assmann P. Chevalier G. Dracopoli N. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1982; 44: 193-196Google Scholar, 21Wice B.M. Trugnan G. Pinto M. Rousset M. Chevalier G. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 139-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If glucose is added back to confluent cells that have been cultured for many generations in its absence, they will still terminally differentiate. This suggests that at some point during exponential growth in the absence of glucose, HT-29 cells make the decision to differentiate. Huet et al.(22Huet C. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Coudrier E. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) noted that ~10% of differentiated HT-29 cells synthesize and secrete intestinal mucins, indicative of a goblet cell-like phenotype. Importantly, they found that a single clone of HT-29-glucose cells can give rise to progeny with enterocyte- and goblet-like phenotypes when switched to media containing carbon sources other than glucose. These results indicate that (i) HT-29 cells cultured in glucose have properties of undifferentiated multipotent transit cells located in the lower half of intestinal crypts, (ii) proliferating HT-29 cells cultured in inosine resemble committed cells located in the upper half of the crypt, and (iii) confluent HT-29-inosine cells have features of terminally differentiating villus-associated enterocytes and goblet cells. Thus, HT-29 cells cultured in media with different carbon sources and/or at different growth phases make decisions that may resemble decisions that occur along the (human) crypt-villus axis. In this report we describe how subtracted cDNA probes were used to screen an HT-29-inosine cDNA library to identify an intestinal and liver tetraspan membrane protein (il-TMP). 1Abbreviations used include: il-TMPintestinal and liver tetraspan membrane proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineIRESinternal ribosome entry siteORFopen reading frameDPP-IVdipeptidylpeptidase IVPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIgimmunoglobulinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateCy3indocarbocyanineEndo Hendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase HmAbmonoclonal antibodyPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoride. il-TMP can mediate density-dependent cell proliferation.

HT-29, SW480, and HeLa cells were cultured at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; [glucose] = 25 mM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS)(23Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). “Inosine” cells were cultured for at least 20 generations in glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 2.5 mM inosine and 10% dialyzed FCS(21Wice B.M.

Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7812-7819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells harvested during early to mid-log phase of growth were defined as “proliferating.” Confluence was defined as the point when cells first cover the entire bottom of a T-flask. Cells maintained in a confluent state for 10-14 days were designated “postconfluent.” The protocols used for preparing, characterizing, and screening this library are described in (23Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, the library was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from proliferating HT-29-inosine cells. A 32P-labeled cDNA “plus” probe was generated from the same RNA preparation and subjected to subtractive hybridization with an excess of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from proliferating HeLa cells cultured in DMEM, 25 mM glucose. A “minus” cDNA probe was used to identify housekeeping sequences in the library. This probe was synthesized from proliferating HeLa-glucose cell RNA and subjected to subtractive hybridization with proliferating HT-29-inosine cell RNA. Phage that reacted with the “plus” probe AND failed to hybridize with the “minus” probe were characterized further. Tissues were obtained during elective surgical procedures and/or from adult organ donors according to guidelines and protocols approved by our University's Human Studies Committee. Some samples were obtained through the National Disease Research Interchange. All samples were snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. To determine if the steady state concentration of il-TMP mRNA varies along the duodenal-colonic axis, segments of intestine were recovered at defined points along this axis from three organ donors (age = 32, 36, and 72 years). The entire bowel of each donor was sampled: i.e. duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and proximal, middle, and/or distal colon (n = 2 separate full thickness samples/segment/donor). Total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cells and from human tissues(23Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), fractionated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with 32P-labeled EcoRI/EcoRI il-TMP fragment or a 650-base pair NcoI/NcoI fragment containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene from pControl/neo (see below). Hybridization and washing stringencies are described in (23Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some blots contained a range of concentrations of purified in vitro transcribed il-TMP mRNA standards. Blots were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Only signals in the linear range of sensitivity were used for calculating il-TMP mRNA levels in samples of total cellular RNA. Two different peptides, representing a portion of each of the two putative extracellular domains of il-TMP, were produced using an Applied Biosystems model 430 synthesizer. Peptide A (GDYLNDEALWNKC) encompasses amino acids 134-146. Peptide B (GKVIDDNDHLSQEIC) corresponds to residues 33-46 and includes an additional C-terminal cysteine. Both peptides were conjugated to Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin via their C-terminal cysteine(25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.S. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Each peptide-conjugate was used to immunize two New Zealand White rabbits. Each animal produced antibodies that recognize the corresponding unconjugated, immobilized peptide as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibodies were purified from serum by affinity chromatography using the ImmunoPure Ag/Ab Immobilization Kit 2 (Pierce). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before fixation. Frozen samples of human intestine or liver were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Miles), and 5-8-μm-thick sections were prepared. Cells or tissue sections were fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min at 0°C and incubated with (i) affinity-purified rabbit il-TMP peptide-specific antibodies (final concentration = 0.5 μg/ml blocking buffer (blocking buffer = PBS, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (w/v) nonfat powdered skim milk, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100) or (ii) mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb; HBB 3/775/42) raised against dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP-IV; (26Hauri H.-P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A.M. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar); obtained from H.P. Hauri, University of Basel; ascites fluid diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; diluted 1:1000 and 1:100, respectively). After removal of the secondary antibodies, nuclei were counterstained with bisbenzimine (Sigma). Cultured cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and stored at −80°C. Cells were thawed in RIPA buffer (PBS containing sodium deoxycholate (1%, w/v), Triton X-100 (1%, v/v), and SDS (0.1%, w/v)) supplemented with protease inhibitors (EDTA (10 mM), aprotinin (50 μg/ml; Sigma), leupeptin (50 μg/ml; Sigma), Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim; 500 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (10 μg/ml; Sigma)). Cellular DNA was sheared by passage through a 27-gauge needle. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample loading buffer was added to the lysates (final concentration of SDS = 2%, 2-mercaptoethanol = 5%; Tris-HCl = 50 mM, pH 6.8). For analysis of adult human tissue proteins, minced pieces of frozen tissue were lyophilized and then rehydrated in 20 ml of 2 × sample buffer plus protease inhibitors/mg dry weight tissue. The thawed, rehydrated tissue was then crushed with a glass rod, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation as above, and DNA was sheared by passage through a 27-gauge needle. To prevent aggregation of il-TMP, the final concentration of total cell protein in the sample loading buffer was kept below 300 μg/ml and the solution was not heated prior to SDS-PAGE(27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Corp.), and the membranes were probed with (i) affinity-purified, il-TMP peptide-specific antibodies (final concentration = 170 ng/ml of PBS containing gelatin (1%, w/v), Tween 20 (0.2%, v/v), and sodium azide (0.1%, w/v)), (ii) a mouse mAb directed against actin (C4; (28Lessard J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1988; 10: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar)), or (iii) a mouse mAb raised against human sucrase-isomaltase (mAb HSI 9, a gift from Andrea Quaroni, Cornell University; cf. (29Beaulieu J.-F. Nichols B. Quaroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20000-20011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). il-TMP-antibody complexes were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the Western Light™ kit (Tropix). Blots were stripped for reprobing with additional antibodies(30Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 203Google Scholar). Cleared cell lysates (3 mg of protein/ml of RIPA buffer) were diluted 10-fold in a solution containing 2% SDS, 5 mM dithiothreitol, plus the protease inhibitors listed above. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. To sequester the SDS added for protein denaturation, the mixture was diluted 10-fold in glycosidase reaction buffer (see below) and incubated at 37°C for 10 min before addition of glycosidase. Digestion with purified recombinant peptide N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim; 8 units/ml incubation) was performed in the presence of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, plus the mixture of protease inhibitors. Digestion with purified recombinant Streptomyces plicatus endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H; Boehringer Mannheim; 5 milliunits/ml incubation) was accomplished using a similar buffer except that 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) was substituted for sodium phosphate. Enzymatic digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C. Sample loading buffer was added, and the reaction products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE without prior heating. The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and processed as above. The vectors designed for these studies allow expression of two different gene products from a single mRNA transcript(31Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 32Ghattas I.R. Sanes J.R. Majors J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5848-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). An “upstream” reporter is synthesized following ribosome binding to the dicistronic mRNA's 5′-cap and subsequent scanning for the first Met codon with a favorable sequence for initiation of translation(33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4159) Google Scholar). The “downstream” reporter is translated by ribosomes that bind to an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) derived from the encephalomyocarditis viral genome(31Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All expression plasmids contained the EcoRI/XhoI fragment of pBluescript SK(+) plus a cytomegalovirus promoter (provided by John Majors, Washington University). pControl/neo was constructed by inserting two fragments into the vector: (i) an EcoRI/Rsr II fragment from pLZ1N(32Ghattas I.R. Sanes J.R. Majors J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5848-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which contains the encephalomyocarditis viral IRES plus the first portion of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (Neo); and (ii) a Rsr II/SalI fragment that contains the remaining portion of Neo plus SV40 splice and polyadenylation sequences from pSV2neo(34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 545Google Scholar). An il-TMP expression vector, pil-TMP/neo, was constructed by inserting the EcoRI/EcoRI fragment of il-TMP DNA into the unique EcoRI site of pControl/neo. HeLa and SW480 cells were plated at a density of ~1 × 105 in 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Costar) containing complete medium (DMEM/FCS) and refed the next day with 5 ml of fresh medium. After 1-2 h, calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitates were added (10 μg plasmid DNA/dish). Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37°C and then subjected to a 1-min shock with 15% dimethyl sulfoxide (prepared in HEPES-buffered saline; (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.S. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar)). Cells were washed with PBS, refed complete medium, incubated for another 36-48 h, and then (i) analyzed for il-TMP expression (defined in the text as “transiently transfected cells”) or (ii) subjected to selection with G418 to obtain pools of stably transfected cells. Selection in G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.; 400 μg/ml complete medium) was allowed to proceed until cell death was no longer apparent (typically 2-3 weeks). Cells were trypsinized and replated every 2-3 days during G418 selection to minimize cell-cell contacts. Stably transfected cells were plated at a density of 9 × 104 cells/25-cm2 T-flask in DMEM, 10% FCS, G418. Cells were refed daily with fresh medium. Cells contained in separate T-flasks were washed with PBS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 days after plating, and lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates were analyzed for total protein concentration according to Peterson(35Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7105) Google Scholar). Duplicate flasks of pControl/neo- or pil-TMP/neo-transfected cells were analyzed at each time point in each of three independent transfection experiments. Focus formation was assessed in parallel cultures of pControl/neo- and pil-TMP/neo-transfected HeLa cells. After 12-14 days of culture, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and stained for 15 min with a solution of 25% isopropanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.025% Coomassie Blue. Flasks were rinsed with 25% isopropanol, 10% acetic acid, allowed to air-dry, and viewed under a dissecting microscope. For each independently transfected pool of cells, focus formation was surveyed in two to three separate experiments. Cells were lysed at 0°C in PBS containing 0.1% SDS, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitors listed above. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated for 10 min at room temperature to reveal peptide epitopes recognized by the il-TMP antibodies. To sequester the SDS used for this denaturation step, a solution of PBS, 20% Triton X-100, 20% sodium deoxycholate was added to the lysate (1 ml/20 ml of lysate) and the mixture incubated for another 10 min at room temperature. Affinity-purified antibodies raised against each of the two il-TMP peptides were then added (2.5 μg of a given antibody preparation/50 μg of total cellular protein) and the solution was incubated overnight at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was introduced (50 μg/μg antibody) and the suspension incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The Protein A-Sepharose, containing bound antibodies and il-TMP, was harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA buffer and once with PBS. Following addition of sample loading buffer, the suspension was incubated for 10 min at 37°C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and il-TMP detected using the Western-Light™ immunoblotting kit. As noted in the Introduction, proliferating HT-29-inosine cells are committed to differentiate after they reach confluence. We reasoned that a cDNA library prepared from these cells encodes proteins that participate in regulating proliferation, allocation to the enterocytic and goblet cell lineages, and/or the differentiation programs of these cells. When this library was screened with cDNA probes that had been subtracted using a protocol described in an earlier report(23Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), 11 recombinant phage were recovered from 100,000 screened. These phage contained four unique cDNA inserts(23Wice B.M. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One of the cDNAs reacted with 1.0- and 1.4-kilobase mRNAs present in proliferating HT-29-inosine but not HeLa cells, thereby satisfying the initial selection criteria for the library screen. The two mRNA transcripts are also present in total cellular RNA isolated from adult human jejunum and liver. They are not detectable in adult human stomach, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, or placental RNAs or in RNAs prepared from human fibroblasts, peripheral blood macrophages, and splenic mononuclear cells (with or without mitogenic stimulation) (data not shown). Surveys of different regions of the entire intestine from each of three adult human organ donors revealed a distinct duodenal-colonic gradient in the concentration of the two transcripts (Fig. 1). Highest levels were noted in the jejunum (7 pg/μg of total cellular RNA). Concentrations in the duodenum, ileum, and colon were 2-4-, 5-10-, and 10-40-fold lower, respectively, than in jejunum. The steady state level of the transcripts in jejunum was 10-20-fold higher than in liver. Southern blots of h"

At high concentrations this renaturation also requires the substrate thiosulfate to have been present during GroEL-rhodanese complex formation. When thiosulfate is present the GroEL-rhodanese complex can be concentrated to greater than 1 mg/ml rhodanese with little effect on the efficiency of renaturation. However, if complex is formed in the absence of thiosulfate, renaturation of rhodanese in the presence of thiosulfate shows a critical concentration of approximately 0.4 mg/ml, above which renaturation yields drop dramatically. This critical concentration appears to be related to an aggregation event in the refolding of rhodanese. The nucleotide free or ADP-bound form of GroEL also binds to rhodanese that has been either already renatured or never denatured. The bound rhodanese has no activity but can be released from GroEL with ATP recovering 90% of control activity. The data presented herein support a release and rebinding mechanism for the GroE-assisted refolding of rhodanese.

In vivo, molecular chaperones such as hsp70/hsp40 and the chaperonins prevent the accumulation of inappropriate protein aggregates and enhance the acquisition of native protein structure. For instance in Escherichia coli, chaperonins are known to bind to a host of partially folded proteins (1Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 2Horwich A.L. Low K.B. Fenton W.A. Hirshfield I.N. Furtak K. Cell. 1993; 74: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and act in concert with the upstream (hsp70/40) molecular chaperones (3Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 4Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.-U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10229Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) to prevent misfolding and aggregation. While the mechanism through which this is accomplished has been the subject of intense research, it is still unclear exactly how chaperones assist protein folding. The most thoroughly studied chaperonin system is the GroE proteins (GroEL and GroES) isolated from E. coli. Results from in vitro protein folding experiments indicate that the GroE chaperonins inhibit protein misfolding and aggregation(5Goloubinoff P.A. Gatenby Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 6Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 7Martin J. Langer T. Beteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed to explain this observation. The first model suggests that the GroE system sequesters the folding protein inside a cavity of the GroEL chaperonin and allows the protein to fold in a shielded environment through repeated ATP-dependent release and rebinding reactions(7Martin J. Langer T. Beteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 10Agard D.A.

The second model suggests that the protein is released from GroEL and folds free in solution but will rebind to the chaperonin if it is not committed to fold to the native state. In this latter model, protein aggregation is prevented by decreasing the concentration of free, aggregation-prone, folding intermediates. Although early evidence suggested that the protein folding intermediates could bind and become sequestered inside the central cavity of GroEL(12Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.-U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 13Braig K. Simon M. Furuya F. Hainfeld J.F. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), later studies have indicated that the protein folding intermediate is easily accessible at the GroEL surface(14Ishii N. Taguchi H. Sasabe H. Yoshida M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, structural studies indicate that the central cavity is not continuous through the GroEL, and its volume may not be large enough to accommodate an expanded protein folding intermediate(15Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P. Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. Saibil H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 16Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). These structural constraints do not preclude the possibility that the protein folding intermediates undergo some folding while bound to GroEL. Gray and Fersht (17Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have suggested that some refolding of barnase can occur while it is in contact with GroEL. They found that an increase in the GroEL concentration alone slows the spontaneous folding rate of barnase to a constant non-zero level rather than producing a continuous decline as expected for a simple bimolecular reaction. In addition, GroEL has been found to induce formation of α-helices in small unstructured polypeptides(18Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7359-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has become clear that secondary structural elements are dictated by non-local as well as local interactions(19Dill K.A. Fiebig K.M. Chan H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1942-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 20Cohen B.I. Presnell S.R. Cohen F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2134-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rapid induction of defined secondary structural elements can arise from constraining conformational search space (21Goldberg M.E. Guillou Y. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and by increasing the concentration of the potential hydrophobic interactive surfaces(22Dado G.P. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12609-12610Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the folding pathways for unstructured polypeptides can be influenced by interaction with the hydrophobic peptide binding surface of the chaperonins(8Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 9Lin Z. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The complete release model also has experimental support. Numerous investigators have examined the lifetime of the protein folding intermediate-GroEL complex and have observed a rapid release of non-native intermediates following ATP addition(23Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 25Wiessman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In this model, the folding protein may still undergo a number of rebinding and release cycles but in contrast with the former hypothesis, released intermediates do not fold in a sequestered environment. The complete release and rebinding mechanism has been criticized on the grounds that the released protein would still have the tendency to aggregate. Since inappropriate aggregation is a concentration-dependent process, the complete release and rebinding mechanism predicts that at high concentrations, the released folding intermediates would aggregate before rebinding to the chaperonin. To determine if a critical aggregation concentration can be observed in a chaperonin-dependent folding reaction, the chaperonin-dependent refolding of rhodanese was monitored as a function of concentration. Rhodanese was used as a substrate for the following reasons: 1) it requires the entire chaperonin system throughout the refolding process to fold efficiently(28Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2) the GroEL-rhodanese complex is stable over time(26Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 266: 16973-16976Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and 3) GroEL-protein substrate complexes can be easily concentrated(27Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13777-13779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results presented herein indicate that concentration-dependent aggregation can be observed for the chaperonin-assisted folding of rhodanese. Under certain solution conditions, rhodanese exhibits a concentration-dependent decline in recovered activity and an increase in aggregation. Rhodanese was purchased from Sigma. Ultrapure urea was purchased from ICN. Centricon ultrafiltration units were from Amicon. Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent was from Pierce. All other chemicals and water were the best quality available. Chaperonin proteins GroEL and GroES were purified as described previously(27Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13777-13779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity of the chaperonin proteins was followed using second derivative spectral analysis(29Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13629-13636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein that had no detectable contribution from tryptophan (as determined by the 290-294 nm peak-trough value) was considered pure(27Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13777-13779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the reconstitutions were carried out in the presence of the complete GroE system containing equimolar amounts of GroEL and GroES oligomers (1 mol of GroE = 14 mol of groEL monomer + 7 mol of GroES monomer). Rhodanese was solubilized in Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. 0.5 mM EDTA) and its concentration determined spectroscopically using the extinction coefficient of 1.75 for a 0.1% solution(30Westley J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Rhodanese was denatured by dilution to concentrations between 0.5 and 10 mg/ml in 8 M urea, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA at 4°C. Denaturation was carried out in the presence or absence of 50 mM sodium thiosulfate. Rhodanese was allowed to incubate in the urea for 2-4 h. No detectable differences in the denaturation or percent recovery was noted within this time frame. dithiothreitol high performance liquid chromatography. Denatured rhodanese was rapidly diluted 1/100 into Buffer A containing either no additional protein or GroE at a 1:1 or 2:1 molar ratio with rhodanese. In some experiments the buffer also contained 50 mM sodium thiosulfate as explained in results. The buffers were pre-equilibrated to 37°C, and the complex was incubated at 37°C for 15 min before additional manipulations. The groE-rhodanese complexes formed as described above were concentrated using ultrafiltration units with a molecular weight cutoff of 30,000. The membranes of the ultrafiltration units were washed with deionized water prior to use, and the protein solutions were concentrated at room temperature in a bench-top centrifuge (1000 × g) for 15-45 min. The degree of concentration was determined by comparing protein concentration before and after centrifugation as determined using a colorimetric protein assay. The extent of concentration was also determined using 280 nm absorbance of the samples before and after concentration. Second derivative spectral analysis was also used to follow the rhodanese in the presence of large excesses of GroE proteins. Second derivative spectra of proteins can be used to measure the ratio of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan in a protein. Since the GroE proteins contain no tryptophan(33Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van-der-Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), we used the presence of a tryptophan spectral signature at 291-294 nm as an indication of the presence of rhodanese. In addition, we were able to use the ratio of the peak trough differences at 283-287 nm and 291-294 nm as a relative measure of the GroE to rhodanese ratio(34Ragone R. Colonna G. Balestrieri C. Servillo L. Irace G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This ratio was checked before and after concentration to assure that rhodanese and GroE concentrated uniformly. No significant change in the ratio of peak trough values were ever detected during the concentration. The presence of ATP, sodium thiosulfate, or DTT do not interfere with the second derivative peak-trough measurements. Rhodanese release and refolding was initiated by the addition of 5 mM ATP to the GroE-rhodanese complex at 37°C. All samples were supplemented to 50 mM sodium thiosulfate at the same time as ATP addition in order to stabilize the refolded rhodanese. At specified times after initiating refolding, aliquots were analyzed either by enzyme activity assay or gel filtration HPLC. Recovery of enzymatic activity was used as a measure of recovery of “native” rhodanese structure. Rhodanese activity was measured using a discontinuous assay as described by Westley(30Westley J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For determining the amount of interaction between rhodanese and groEL, proteins were separated by gel filtration HPLC on a TSK-3000SW gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA. The HPLC used was a Waters 600S controller 626 pump with in-line UV-Vis detection using a Waters 996 photodiode array. Spectral data from the photodiode diode array was collected and analyzed using Waters Millennium software. As has been shown previously(31Tandon S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9859-9866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when urea-denatured rhodanese was rapidly diluted 1/100 into Buffer A containing 50 mM sodium thiosulfate but no GroE, recovery of activity was consistently low and decreased as rhodanese concentration increased. However, in the presence of GroE chaperonins and ATP, high recoveries are possible (~100% at <30 μg/ml rhodanese). In spite of this enhancement in activity regain, a concentration-dependent decline in recoverable activity was observed when increasing concentrations of unfolded rhodanese were rapidly renatured in the presence of equimolar GroE (Fig. 1). The recovery of rhodanese activity in these experiments was not improved by increasing the GroE:rhodanese ratio from 1:1 to 2:1. When GroE-rhodanese complex was preformed in Buffer A plus 50 mM sodium thiosulfate at 30 μg/ml rhodanese (0.9 μM), the arrested complex could be concentrated to very high protein concentrations by centrifugal ultrafiltration. When this concentrate was diluted back to concentrations between 50 and 1200 μg/ml rhodanese and then initiated to refold by addition of ATP, recovery of activity was near 94 ± 11% and did not show a decline with increased protein concentration (Fig. 2). This is similar to what is seen with glutamine synthetase(27Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13777-13779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recovery of active rhodanese in these experiments was the same for 1:1 and 2:1 groE:rhodanese ratios. However, when the GroE-rhodanese complex was formed in the absence of sodium thiosulfate at a GroE:rhodanese ratio of 1:1 and then treated as described above, high recovery of activity was detected only for rhodanese concentrations less than 400 μg/ml. Above this concentration, the activity begins to plateau. Under these conditions, increasing the concentration of the GroEL-rhodanese complex above 500 μg/ml total rhodanese does not result in a significant increase in activity (Fig. 2). In an effort to determine the fate of the released rhodanese at high protein concentrations (2.5 mg/ml rhodanese), HPLC gel filtration was used to separate the GroEL, GroEL-rhodanese complex from free rhodanese (Fig. 3). On the TSK-3000SW column used, the free GroEL coelutes with groEL-rhodanese and groEL-groES complexes. However, rhodanese in the GroEL-rhodanese complex can be distinguished from GroEL and GroES by the tryptophan contribution to its second derivative spectra. Second derivative spectral analysis was performed on each peak eluting from the column (Fig. 3, A and B, inset). For complexes formed in the presence of sodium thiosulfate there is no significant difference between the chromatograms monitored at 280 nm before and after 15-min incubation with 5 mM ATP (Fig. 3A). This is probably due to the GroE proteins being present at 21-fold molar excess over rhodanese (14 GroEL and 7 GroES per complex). Under these conditions the released rhodanese is difficult to detect. However a difference can be seen in the second derivative spectral analysis of the GroEL/complex peak. For this peak, a significant decrease was seen in the tryptophan contribution indicated by the 290-294 nm peak-trough value after incubation with ATP (inset), indicative of a decrease in the amount of tryptophan containing rhodanese bound to the GroEL. When the GroE-rhodanese complex was formed in the absence of sodium thiosulfate and then analyzed as described above before and after incubation with 5 mM ATP for 15 min, a similar change in the second derivative of the GroEL/complex peak was observed. In addition, a peak eluting at the void volume of the column was also detected after incubation with ATP. The elution time and spectrum of this void volume peak mirrored that observed for aggregated rhodanese (urea denatured and diluted into Buffer A alone). The appearance of this peak in samples where the complex was formed without thiosulfate indicates that under these conditions GroE can no longer prevent inappropriate aggregation at high rhodanese concentrations. At final concentrations between 0.5 and 2.0 mg/ml rhodanese, this void volume peak was not observed even though activity recovery is low. Since aggregation is a concentration-dependent event, concentrations between 0.5 and 2.0 mg/ml may not be high enough to form an aggregate that is excluded from the TSK-3000SW column. Second derivative analysis of the base-line spectra in these chromatogram shows a very weak “protein signature” in the 280-300 nm region which suggests that ill-defined aggregates may spread out over the elution profile (data not shown). While characterizing the GroE-assisted rhodanese refolding reaction at 37°C, it was observed that activity versus refolding time was not a simple profile. There is both an activation and inactivation reaction occurring at the same time in these samples. In addition, when the GroE-rhodanese complex was formed in the presence of thiosulfate, concentrated, and then diluted to 100 μg/ml rhodanese in the presence of 5 mM ATP, the time course of activity regain was GroE concentration-dependent (Fig. 4A). At all GroE concentrations, the rhodanese activity increased to a maximum in 15-20 min and then decreased relative to control activity. However, the rate with which the rhodanese lost activity was dependent on the GroE concentration. As the GroE concentration increased, the rate of activity loss also increased. It should be noted that at all GroE concentrations the rate of activity loss was greater than that for rhodanese in the absence of GroE. The presence of an ATP regenerating system in these experiments delayed the onset of the activity decline, but did not prevent it (data not shown). With regards to the concentration experiments outlined in the previous section, it should be noted that losses in activity at 30 min for the 1:1 and 2:1 GroE-rhodanese complex ratios were not significant (Fig. 4A). When native, untreated rhodanese (100 μg/ml) was incubated at 37°C in Buffer A containing 50 mM sodium thiosulfate, enzyme activity decreases slowly (data not shown). When native rhodanese was incubated with GroE under the same conditions, initial activity was approximately 90% of control activity and decreased relative to control activity over the next hour (Fig. 4B). At all concentrations of GroE proteins we saw a decrease in activity relative to control. The rate and extent of decrease reached a maximum at a 10:1 molar excess of GroE over rhodanese. Addition of 5 mM ATP results in regain of 90% of the control activity within 15 min even at 10:1 molar excess of groE. HPLC analysis was performed on these native rhodanese GroE mixtures either immediately after mixing, after a 50-min incubation at 37°C or after a 50-min incubation at 37°C followed by a 15-min incubation in the presence of 5 mM ATP (Fig. 5). Integrating the area under the peaks in the 280 nm chromatogram shows a decrease in the area of the peak corresponding to native rhodanese after the initial 50-min incubation with GroE (Fig. 5A). In addition, the second derivative analysis of the GroEL/complex peak shows an increase in the 290-294 nm peak-trough value (Fig. 5B). These changes suggests that the rhodanese in these mixtures is binding to the GroEL over time and eluting from the gel filtration column as a GroEL-rhodanese complex. After a 15-min incubation with 5 mM ATP, there is a small increase in the area of the rhodanese peak in the 280 nm chromatogram and a complete loss of the 290-294 nm peak-trough in the second derivative spectra of the GroEL/complex peak, suggesting that the rhodanese has been released from the GroEL. The second derivative spectra in Fig. 5B have been normalized to emphasize the changes in the 290-294 nm region. There are also small changes in the absolute values at 283 and 287 nm resulting from an increase in the total amount of protein in the GroEL/complex peak as rhodanese and/or GroES bind to GroEL. The question of how chaperonins function to assist in the folding of nascent polypeptide is one of great complexity. Chaperonins are known to assist in the in vitro refolding of a variety of proteins of both procaryotic and eucaryotic origin. The requirements for efficient refolding vary from protein substrate to protein substrate such that some protein folding intermediates can be released from GroEL by the addition of the co-chaperonin GroES or ATP/ADP alone, whereas others require the presence of both GroES and ATP together. To test whether non-native folding intermediates were dissociating from GroEL, Wiessman et al.(25Wiessman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) used mutant non-functional forms of GroEL to trap folding intermediates that were released from the wild-type GroEL complexes. Results indicated that released folding intermediates of rhodanese and ornithine decarboxylase bind to and become trapped on the mutant GroEL. This mutant form cannot release the folding intermediates in the presence of ATP and inhibits the folding when the refolding was initiated from wild type GroEL-protein folding intermediate complexes. This suggests that the wild-type GroEL releases non-native folding intermediates that rebind to mutant GroEL and become trapped. These observations could not rule out the possibility that the protein folding intermediates shuttle between GroEL oligomers through a direct transfer mechanism. However, this latter mechanism is without experimental support and is simply speculative. Our initial finding that rhodanese can be refolded from a GroEL complex at concentrations as high as 2.5 mg/ml rhodanese is intriguing. If a release and rebinding mechanism is operative, the formation of a GroEL-rhodanese complex in the presence of thiosulfate may result in an intermediate that has either an extremely high or non-existent critical aggregation concentration. It is interesting to note that the total protein concentration in the refolding milieu (including rhodanese, GroEL, and GroES) is in excess of 30 mg/ml, and yet rhodanese recovery is near 100% of the control activity. However, when refolding is attempted with a slightly different form of protein folding intermediate that binds to GroEL in the absence of thiosulfate, there is a concentration above which the recovery of activity decreases significantly. This suggests that rhodanese may bind to GroEL in a minimum of two conformers whose bound structures depend on the absence or presence of thiosulfate in the complex. Upon release, these different intermediates appear to exhibit drastically different critical aggregation concentrations. The exact role of thiosulfate in these experiments is impossible to determine from these data, but it is fairly clear that thiosulfate influences the folding pathway of rhodanese. It is tempting to speculate that thiosulfate donates a sulfur that binds directly to rhodanese folding intermediates and shifts the intermediate population toward more native form, thereby decreasing the conformational space that rhodanese must search in order to fold correctly. Upon release from GroEL, this sulfur-bound form might obtain native structure more rapidly and therefore be less prone to aggregation. Goldberg and Guillou (21Goldberg M.E. Guillou Y. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) report that guanidine-denatured hen egg white lysozyme rapidly collapses into a compact intermediate upon dilution of the denaturant. The amount of secondary structure detectable in this intermediate differs greatly, depending on whether or not the unfolded protein has intact disulfide bridges. If the unfolded protein is reduced, this intermediate has much less secondary structure than when refolding is initiated from the non-reduced enzyme. The suggestion is that the disulfide bonds constrain the 3° structure of the protein folding intermediate and facilitate folding to the native structure by limiting the conformational search space. We suggest that thiosulfate has a similar effect on rhodanese. The fact that the crystal structure of rhodanese has been determined with a hetero-atom of sulfur bound and that thiosulfate is one of the substrates for the enzymatic reaction lend support to this speculation. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested. In the refolding experiments, the observed decline in rhodanese activity seen at long time periods could be due to thermal inactivation, aggregation, or covalent damage to the rhodanese conformation. However, if this were the case, GroEL would be expected to protect the rhodanese from conformational damage, at least in the case of thermal inactivation(26Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 266: 16973-16976Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In the experiments presented here, increasing the concentration of GroEL leads to a more rapid decrease in activity, suggesting that, in fact, the GroEL is sequestering the rhodanese in an inactive form. We have also demonstrated the binding of native rhodanese to GroEL under conditions which maintain rhodanese activity in the absence of GroEL. This bound form is released and reactivates after ATP addition. Although it is impossible to determine the structure of the bound rhodanese from these data, the form that binds must be in equilibrium with the native structure. Support for the existence of this equilibrium comes from the observation that there is GroEL concentration dependence in the rate of inactivation and that the released form regains native activity. We have yet to determine the lifetime of the complex at 37°C. Although these results appear to conflict with previous reports where no interactions between rhodanese and either wild-type or mutant GroEL were observed(25Wiessman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), the solution conditions used here were significantly different. The GroEL-native rhodanese interaction appears to be favored under our conditions of high protein concentrations, low ATP, and physiological temperatures. Martin et al.(32Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) report that addition of GroEL alone increases the rate of thermal inactivation of dihydrofolate reductase over that seen for dihydrofolate reductase alone or dihydrofolate reductase in the presence of GroEL, GroES, and MgATP. This is comparable with what we see with rhodanese at 37°C. Our results may also explain the decreased yield of active rhodanese seen by Mendoza et al.(26Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 266: 16973-16976Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) as the GroE:rhodanese ratio was increased from 2:1 to 8:1. The data presented here provides support for the complete release and rebinding model. This does not rule out the possibility that some folding may occur while the protein folding intermediate is bound directly to or sequestered by GroEL. For example, glutamine synthetase has a limited time of interaction with GroEL (28Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yet is released in a different conformation (i.e. not aggregation prone) as compared with the pre-groEL-influenced intermediate(27Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13777-13779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proportion of folding that is induced by direct interaction between folding intermediates and GroEL is probably dependent on the nature of the folding substrate. However, given the limited evidence for folding on GroEL (17Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7359-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) more data supporting protein folding in a sequestered environment is needed. We also present evidence of an interaction between GroEL and a native or near native form of rhodanese which suggests that GroEL binds to multiple intermediates in the path from unfolded rhodanese to native rhodanese. These individual intermediates may be free in solution at some time and have varying critical aggregation concentrations and folding properties.

Clone 9 cells express GLUT1 but not GLUT2, −3, and −4, and the azide effect was not accompanied by any increase in cellular or plasma membrane GLUT1 level. To identify the molecular event underlying this apparent increase in GLUT1 intrinsic activity, we studied the acute effects of azide on the substrate binding activity of GLUT1 in Clone 9 cells by measuring glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding. The glucose-displaceable, cytochalasin B binding activity was barely detectable in membranes isolated from Clone 9 cells under control conditions but was readily detectable after a 60-min incubation of cells in the presence of 5 mM azide showing a 3-fold increase in binding capacity with no change in binding affinity. Furthermore, the cytochalasin B binding activity of purified human erythrocyte GLUT1 reconstituted in liposomes was significantly reduced in the presence of cytosol derived from azide-treated Clone 9 cells but not in the presence of cytosol from control cells; this effect was heat-labile and abolished by the presence of the peptide corresponding to the GLUT1 COOH-terminal sequence. These results suggest that a cytosolic protein in Clone 9 cells binds to GLUT1 at its COOH-terminal domain and inhibits its substrate binding and that azide-induced metabolic alteration releases GLUT1 from this inhibitory interaction. Studying the binding of cytosolic proteins derived from 35S-labeled Clone 9 cells to glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing glucose transporter COOH-terminal sequences, we identified 28- and 70-kDa proteins that bind specifically to the cytoplasmic domain of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in vitro. We also found a 32P-labeled, 85-kDa protein that binds to GLUT4 but not to GLUT1 and only in cytosol derived from azide-treated cells. The roles, if any, of these glucose transporter-binding proteins in the azide-sensitive modulation of GLUT1 substrate binding activity in Clone 9 cells are yet to be determined.

A family of six distinct intrinsic membrane proteins (facilitative glucose transporters) catalyze the glucose uptake and release in animal cells(1Bell G.I. Burant C.F. Takeda J. Gould G.W. J. Biol.

GLUT1, the member (isoform) of this family that is abundant in human erythrocytes and transformed cell lines, catalyzes glucose uptake in Clone 9 cells(2Ismail-Beigi F. J. Membr.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6437-6444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mammalian muscle, and adipose cells(6Morgan H.E. Whitfield C.F. Curr. Top. Membr. 1973; 4: 255-303Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the glucose utilization in Clone 9 cells is rate-limited and metabolically regulated at the transport step(3Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Vikstrom K. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17225-17232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A brief (1-2 h) exposure to cyanide or azide, inhibitors of oxidation phosphorylation, stimulates glucose uptake in Clone 9 cells 6-8-fold (3Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Vikstrom K. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17225-17232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C527-C532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This acute effect of azide occurs without any increase in cellular GLUT1 content(3Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Vikstrom K. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17225-17232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it is due to a post-translational modulation. A longer (up to 24 h) incubation with azide causes an additional 2-fold stimulation of glucose uptake in these cells(7Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C527-C532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the acute effect, however, this later effect of azide is accompanied by 2- and 8-fold increases in GLUT1 and GLUT1 mRNA cellular content, respectively(8Shetty M. Ismail-Beigi N. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1224-CC229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it is largely due to a pretranslational modulation. The two well known post-translational mechanisms for glucose transport regulation in animal cells include changes in transporter intrinsic activity (2Ismail-Beigi F. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and transporter redistribution from a microsomal storage pool to the cell surface (recruitment)(9Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). A 2-h incubation with azide only slightly increases plasma membrane GLUT1 levels in Clone 9 cells(3Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Vikstrom K. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17225-17232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the acute effect of azide on glucose transport is due to an increased GLUT1 intrinsic activity rather than GLUT1 recruitment. Furthermore, kinetic studies have shown that the acute glucose transport stimulation by azide is due to an increased Vmax with no change in Km for glucose(4Mercado C.L. Leob J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C19-C28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that azide most likely increases GLUT1 catalytic turnover. Alternatively, however, it is also possible that azide converts GLUT1 from an inactive state to an active state in terms of substrate binding; GLUT1 in Clone 9 cells may be largely kept in an inactive state where it cannot bind substrate, and an azide-induced metabolic alteration may convert this inactive GLUT1 to an active (unmasked) state where it can now bind glucose with a given affinity and is hence functional. In the present study, we tested the alternative possibility discussed above. We studied the substrate binding capacity of GLUT1 in Clone 9 cells by measuring D-glucose-sensitive CB 1The abbreviations used are: CBcytochalasin BCEcytochalasin EGSTglutathione S-transferaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumTLCKNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketoneTPCKN-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketoneIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosidePBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. binding and examined if it is increased after azide treatment in association with the transport stimulation. CB, a well known inhibitor of facilitative glucose transporters, binds to GLUT1, and this binding is readily and specifically displaced by D-glucose but not by L-glucose(11Jung C.Y. Rampal A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5456-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This D-glucose-induced cytochalasin B displacement has been used extensively as an assay for substrate binding activity of GLUT1(12Sogin D.C. Hinkle P.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5417-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the glucose-displaceable cytochalasin B binding activity is barely detectable in membranes isolated from control Clone 9 cells, but it is increased greatly after a 1-h incubation with azide. We further show that the glucose-displaceable cytochalasin B binding capacity of GLUT1 purified from human erythrocytes and reconstituted as proteoliposomes is significantly reduced in the presence of cytosol isolated from azide-treated Clone 9 cells but not from untreated Clone 9 cells. We also describe three distinct cytosolic proteins that bind to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT1 and GLUT4 but not to irrelevant fusion proteins. Possible roles of these putative glucose transporter-binding proteins in the regulation of glucose transporter function in response to metabolic alteration are discussed. cytochalasin B cytochalasin E glutathione S-transferase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Clone 9 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and used between the 24th and 34th passages.

Untreated plastic culture dishes were from Corning Glass Works (Medfield, MA). Cytochalasin B Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Life Science (Chicago, IL).

Human GLUT1 and GLUT4 cDNA plasmids were obtained from Dr. Graeme I. Bell of HHMI at the University of Chicago. Synthetic peptide of the GLUT1 cytosolic COOH-terminal sequence (KVPETKGRTFDEIASGFRQGGASQSDKTPEELFHPLGADSQV) was obtained from Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc. (Hopkins, MD). Clone 9 cells were maintained on plastic culture dishes in DMEM containing 5.6 mMD-glucose supplemented with 10% calf serum at 37°C in a 9% CO2-humidified atmosphere (pH 7.4). These cells formed confluent monolayers and exhibited density-dependent (contact) growth inhibition. For each experiment, cells were passaged at 1:8 dilution and seeded on 100-mm culture dishes in 8 ml of medium containing 10% calf serum. When the cells reached confluence (at 3-4 days), the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% calf serum and used after 16-18 h of culture. Cells were treated with diluent (80 μl of DMEM) or 5 mM azide (dissolved in 80 μl of DMEM) for 1 h prior to use. Clone 9 cells cultured to confluency on ten 100-mm plates were rinsed twice with 8 ml of PBS, harvested in PBS, and pooled in 3 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mM each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, TLCK, and TPCK. After 10 min of cell swelling on ice, cells were homogenized with 20 strokes by employing a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The resulting lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min to pellet the nuclei, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged for 60 min at 185,000 × g at 4°C. The pellets (total membranes) were resuspended in 1 ml of the above lysis buffer, and the supernatants (cytosols) were partially lyophilized to minimize overall dilution (1000-fold or less). Both total membranes and cytosols were stored at −70°C and used within 2 weeks of preparation. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard. Azide at the concentrations present was shown to have no effect on the assay(7Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C527-C532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For 35S labeling, Clone 9 cells grown in twenty 100-mm culture plates were rinsed twice with methionine-free DMEM and reincubated for 6 h in 8 ml of methionine-free DMEM. Then the cells on each plate were incubated in 2.5 ml of methionine-free DMEM containing 80 μCi of TRAN-35S label. After 16 h of incubation, cells were treated with diluent or 5 mM azide (dissolved in methionine-free DMEM) for 1 h prior to harvest. Cells were then fractionated to total membrane and cytosol as described above. Radioactivity of protein labeling was measured by scintillation counting, and the efficiency of labeling was expressed as cpm/mg of protein. For 32P labeling, four 100-mm confluent plates of cells were rinsed four times with sodium phosphate-free DMEM and incubated for 2 h with 2.5 ml of sodium phosphate-free DMEM containing 3.5 μl of 5 M NaCl and 1.25 mCi of 32P (9,000 Ci/mmol). After 2 h, cells were treated with diluent or azide (dissolved in sodium phosphate-free DMEM) for 1 additional hour prior to harvest. All subsequent steps were as described above except that 1 ml of lysis buffer was used per two plates of cells. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Cell fractions containing equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethamol and incubated in 60°C water bath for 30 min. Solubilized protein samples were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted on the nitrocellulose paper according to the standard methods(15Davis L.G. Dihner M.D. Battev J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). Blots were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with antibodies specific to GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, or GLUT4 at 1:500 dilution. The antigen-antibody complexes were recognized using horseradish peroxidase-protein A diluted 1:4000 and then developed by Western blotting detection reagents. In experiments analyzing the GST fusion protein, 2 μg of each fusion protein eluted from 10 mM of glutathione was used. Equilibrium cytochalasin B binding was measured by a centrifugation method as described previously (11Jung C.Y. Rampal A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5456-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Total membranes (100 μg of protein) isolated from control and azide-treated cells were suspended in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris buffer containing a tracer amount (0.02 μCi) of [3H]cytochalasin B with a varying concentration (0-10 μM) of unlabeled cytochalasin B and 1.5% ethanol (pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 185,000 × g at 4°C for 60 min, and aliquots (0.3 ml) of the supernatant were removed for radioactivity measurement. The supernatant remaining in the tube was aspirated completely, and the inner wall of the tube was wiped with cotton swabs to remove any residual medium. Pellets thus obtained were dissolved in 400 μl of 1% SDS for 2 h and used for radioactivity measurement for bound ligand. Radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using 3 ml of Ecoscint as counting fluid. D-Glucose displaceable cytochalasin B binding was quantitated by calculating the difference in CB binding measured in the presence of 500 mMD-glucose and L-glucose. In experiments where the effects of Clone 9 cell cytosol on D-glucose-sensitive CB binding activity of purified GLUT1 were measured, purified GLUT1 (5 μg of protein) was preincubated with 0.5-1 ml of 10 mM Tris/150 mM NaCl buffer alone or the same buffer containing 150-200 μg of cytosol proteins for 1-2 h in room temperature. Samples were then subjected to D-glucose-sensitive CB binding assay as described above. The procedure of expression and purification of GST fusion proteins was essentially as described(16Liu H. Xiong S. Shi Y. Samuel S.J. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7869-7875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The fragments of DNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT1 and GLUT4 were produced by PCR methods(17Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocol: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1993: 3-12Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed according to the human cDNA sequence. For the needs of ligation, BamHI restriction site was added at the sense primer, and EcoRI restriction site was added at the antisense primer. A nonsense fusion protein whose open reading frame encoding from the 3′ end to the 5′ end of GLUT4 cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain was also made and used as a negative control. In this case, BamHI was added at the antisense primer while the EcoRI was added at the sense primer. The DNA fragments produced by PCR were then ligated into pGEX.3X vector and introduced into E. coli (DH5α) by transformation. A small number of transformants were grown in liquid culture in the presence of IPTG to induce expression of the fusion protein and were screened for expression of the expected fusion protein by SDS-PAGE of total cell lysates and for the ability of the soluble fusion protein to bind to glutathione-agarose. The GST fusion proteins corresponding to the COOH-terminal of GLUT1 and GLUT4 were further confirmed by PCR methods and Western blotting. A suitable transformant was then grown on a large scale, and fusion proteins were purified by incubating soluble materials from lysed cells with glutathione-agarose beads. When specified, the fusion proteins were eluted from washed beads by 5-10 mM glutathione based on competition with free glutathione. 75 μg of each purified GST fusion protein was used for specific binding. GST fusion proteins coupled with glutathione beads were incubated with 35S-labeled control or azide-treated cytosol (150 μg in 2 ml of PBS) for 5 h at 4°C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with PBS containing 150 mM NaCl. Proteins bound to GST fusion proteins were eluted by 150 μl of 10 mM glutathione for 30 min. The eluates were applied on a 150-mm slab gel and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE as described(18Lachaal M. Berenski C.J. Kim J. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15449-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were incubated in EN3HANCE for 1 h and tap water for 0.5 h. They were then dried and autophotographed on film for 2-7 days at −70°C. Clone 9 cells were incubated in the absence and presence of 5 mM sodium azide for 60 min, and the equilibrium binding of cytochalasin B to the total membranes prepared from these cells was measured as a function of cytochalasin B concentration in the absence and the presence of an excess of cytochalasin E and/or D-glucose (Fig. 1). With ligand concentrations up to 10-5 M, there was saturable and linear binding of cytochalasin B to the membranes of both control and azide-treated cells. An excess (0.1 mM) of cytochalasin E, the cytochalasin B analog that binds to cytoskeletal proteins with an high affinity but does not bind to GLUT1 in human erythrocytes(11Jung C.Y. Rampal A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5456-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pinkofsky H.B. Rampal A.L. Cowden M.A. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4930-4937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), greatly inhibited the saturable binding of the ligand to membranes of both control and azide-treated cells (Fig. 1). An excess (500 mM) of D-glucose, on the other hand, affected the saturable CB binding very little if at all in membranes isolated from control cells, although this glucose effect was slightly but significantly greater in the presence of an excess of CE (Fig. 1A). More importantly, this glucose effect was clearly demonstrable in membranes of azide-treated cells even in the absence of CE (Fig. 1B), and an excess of CE did not affect this glucose effect. For both control and azide-treated cells, a significant portion of the saturable, cytochalasin B binding was seen even in the presence of both D-glucose and cytochalasin E in excess (Fig. 1). These findings indicate that there are at least three distinct, membrane-associated, saturable CB binding components in Clone 9 cells, namely, a glucose-sensitive component, a cytochalasin E-sensitive component, and a component that is insensitive to both glucose and CE. Of importance is the finding that the acute azide treatment increases the glucose-sensitive, CB binding component. The apparent increase in the glucose-sensitive CB binding to control cell membranes by an excess of CE observed (Fig. 1A) is intriguing; it is reminiscent of our previous observation (19Pinkofsky H.B. Rampal A.L. Cowden M.A. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4930-4937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that in human erythrocyte membranes the displacement of CB by glucose plus CE exceeds the sum of their independent displacements. The CE-sensitive and CE-insensitive CB binding components mentioned above were analyzed (not illustrated) according to Scatchard(20Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). The CE-sensitive CB binding was estimated by measuring the difference in ligand binding observed in the presence and in the absence of 10-4 M CE. The CE-insensitive binding component was estimated by measuring CB binding in the presence of 10-4 M CE and substracting linear binding component. The CE-sensitive binding in Scatchard plot revealed a single binding component with apparent KD and BT (total binding capacity) of approximately 2 μM and 80 pmol/mg protein, respectively, for both control and azide-treated cells. The CE-insensitive CB binding also revealed an apparent linearity in Scatchard plot, yielding an apparent KD of 0.2 μM for both control and azide-treated cells. The plot, however, gave BT values of approximately 15 and 20 pmol/mg protein for control and azide-treated cells, respectively, indicating that azide treatment selectively increases the high affinity, CE-insensitive CB binding in Clone 9 cell membranes. It should be noted that the KD value for this apparently azide-sensitive, high affinity binding component is similar to the KD value known for cytochalasin B binding to GLUT1 (11Jung C.Y. Rampal A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5456-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next quantitated the glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding to Clone 9 cell membranes that is stereospecifically displaced by D-glucose, the physiological substrate of GLUT1, by quantitating difference in cytochalasin B binding observed between the presence of 500 mMD- and L-glucose (Fig. 2). For control cells, CB bound less in the presence of D-glucose than in the presence of L-glucose, but the difference was so slight that exact quantitation was rather difficult (Fig. 2). However, when we repeated these measurements with membranes derived from azide-treated cells, cytochalasin B binding was clearly less in the presence of D-glucose compared with that in the presence of L-glucose (Fig. 2), demonstrating that a significant portion of the ligand bound to membranes derived from azide-treated cells is readily displaceable by D-glucose but not by L-glucose. This D-glucose-sensitive CB binding was a saturable function of CB concentrations for both control and azide-treated cells (Fig. 2). Scatchard analysis of the D-glucose-sensitive, CB binding data (not illustrated) revealed a single CB binding component with an apparent KD and BT value of 0.26 ± 0.03 μM and 1.8 ± 1.6 pmol/mg protein for control cells (n = 3) and 0.25 ± 0.03 μM and 6.7 ± 1.2 pmol/mg protein for azide-treated cells (n = 4), respectively. These KD values are similar to the KD values of the CE-insensitive, CB binding component, but an order of magnitude smaller than that of the CE-sensitive, CB binding component discussed above. Data of the D-glucose-displaceable CB binding to membranes of azide-treated Clone 9 cells measured in the presence of 10-4 M CE (not illustrated) gave KD and BT of 0.31 μM and 6.1 pmol/mg protein, respectively, indicating that the glucose effect was not affected in the presence of an excess of CE. We next examined expression of glucose transporter isoforms in Clone 9 cells. GLUT1 is the only isoform detectable in Northern blot of Clone 9 cells(7Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C527-C532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our Western blot analysis shows that Clone 9 cells express GLUT1 protein in abundance without any detectable amounts of GLUT2, GLUT4 (Fig. 3), or GLUT3 (not illustrated). Again, the acute treatment (2 h) with azide did not affect Clone 9 cell GLUT1 content to any significant degree (Fig. 3). These findings strongly suggest that the D-glucose-sensitive portion of the saturable CB binding is due to GLUT1 and that the acute azide treatment increases the GLUT1 CB binding capacity without GLUT1 content in Clone 9 cells. The exact nature of this azide-induced apparent increase in GLUT1 CB binding, particularly its relevance to GLUT1 substrate (glucose) binding function, can only be speculated at this time. An interesting possibility for the observed increase in glucose-sensitive CB binding in azide-treated cells is that GLUT1 in Clone 9 cells may largely be kept in such a (masked) state that it can not bind glucose and CB and that azide treatment converts this inactive GLUT1 to functional GLUT1 in terms of both the substrate and CB binding activities. A certain cytosolic factor or factors may be responsible for this azide-induced modulation of GLUT1 glucose and CB binding activities. To test this possibility, we examined whether the cytochalasin B binding activity of purified GLUT1 and/or its sensitivity to D-glucose are affected by cytosol derived from basal and azide-treated Clone 9 cells (Fig. 4). Human erythrocyte GLUT1 was purified and reconstituted in liposomes(18Lachaal M. Berenski C.J. Kim J. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15449-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding of cytochalasin B to this preparation was measured as a function of CB concentrations and analyzed in Scatchard plot. When suspended in Tris buffer, purified GLUT1 typically bound CB with KD and BT of 0.2-0.4 μM and 14-16 nmol/mg protein, respectively (Fig. 4A). The incubation of purified GLUT1 in Tris buffer containing 5 mM azide for up to 60 min prior to measurement did not affect its CB binding activity (not illustrated). When suspended in cytosol of control Clone 9 cells, GLUT1 bound CB equally well, showing apparent KD and BT values that were practically identical to those measured in buffer alone (Fig. 4A, inset). In the presence of the cytosol derived from azide-treated cells, however, CB binding was significantly reduced compared with those in buffer or in the presence of the cytosol derived from control cells (Fig. 4A), and this reduction was due to a decrease in BT without any significant change in KD (Fig. 4, A (inset) and C). Furthermore, this reduction in BT by azide-treated cytosol was largely (50% or more) abolished in the presence of the peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of GLUT1 (Fig. 4C). These findings suggest the presence of a factor in azide-treated cell cytosol that interacts with purified GLUT1 at its COOH-terminal domain and inhibits its CB binding activity and that this factor is virtually missing in cytosol obtained from control cells. There was no reduction in CB binding when this experiment was repeated using azide-treated cytosol preheated for 15 min at 70°C (Fig. 4B), indicating that the factor is heat-labile, thus most likely a protein. To identify this putative, GLUT1-binding protein proposed above, we studied possible binding of Clone 9 cell cytosol proteins to GLUT1 GST fusion proteins (Fig. 5). The peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of GLUT1 and GLUT4 (amino acid sequences of 427-492 and 428-493, respectively) were fused with GST (GST-G1C and GST-G4C, respectively) by molecular cloning. For negative control, a “nonsense” fusion protein whose open reading frame encodes the COOH-terminal portion of GLUT4 in the 3′ to 5′ direction (GST-G4CR) was also prepared. The GST fusion proteins were then purified from bacterial lysates based on their ability to bind to glutathione-agarose beads. The GST-G1C and GST-G4C were 85 and 95% pure, respectively, with apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa as revealed by protein staining in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5), and their identities were further confirmed by Western blotting (not illustrated) using appropriate antibodies (specific to a COOH-terminal 13 amino-acid sequence of GLUT1 and GLUT4, respectively). The Clone 9 cells were metabolically labeled with 35S, and labeled cytosolic proteins were separated free of membrane proteins by centrifugation at 185,000 × g for 60 min. The cytosol were then incubated with purified GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-agarose beads. The bound cytosolic proteins were separated from unbound ones by centrifugation. To prevent nonspecific binding, the GST fusion protein beads were washed three times with PBS before use. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by adding 5 mM glutathione. The eluted proteins were then separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. A typical result of such an experiment revealed two cytosolic proteins with apparent molecular masses of 70 and 28 kDa that bind to GLUT1 and GLUT4 GST fusion proteins but not to GST (Fig. 6) or to the GST fusion protein of “incorrectly orientated GLUT4 COOH terminus” (not illustrated). The 70-kDa protein binding was much more intense for GLUT4 fusion protein than for GLUT1 fusion protein (Fig. 6). Azide treatment (5 mM for 1 h) did not reproducibly affect either the 28- or the 70-kDa protein binding appreciably in these experiments. It is interesting to note that there is a 70-kDa protein in rat adipocyte cytosol that binds to the GST fusion proteins of GLUT1 and 4, although the relationship if any of this adipocyte protein to the 70-kDa Clone 9 cell protein is yet to be determined. The 28-kDa protein binding, on the other hand, appeared unique to Clone 9 cells; no 28-kDa protein binding to GLUT1 or GLUT4 fusion proteins was detectable when rat adipocyte or hepatocyte cytosols were employed in these experiments (not illustrated). To test if either the 70- or the 28-kDa GLUT1-binding protein is a phosphoprotein, we repeated these experiments using 32P-labeled Clone 9 cell cytosol (Fig. 7). Neither 70- nor 28-kDa protein binding was detected with 32P-labeled cytosols for GLUT1 and GLUT4 fusion proteins, indicating that the 70- and 28-kDa GLUT1-binding protein are not phosphoproteins. Instead, there was a 32P-labeled, 85-kDa protein that bound to GLUT4 fusion protein but not to GLUT1 fusion protein. Furthermore, this 85-kDa phosphoprotein binding was seen only in cytosol of azide-treated cells and not of control cells (Fig. 7). The 85-kDa binding was not always (two in four independent experiments) reproducible. The failure in detection of this protein by 35S-labeled cytosol would suggest that its metabolic turnover is rather slow. It is known that anaerobic glycolysis in many animal cells is physiologically suppressed under normal aerobic conditions and that this suppression is released when oxidative metabolism is inhibited (21Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.A. Hasselberger F.X. Schulz D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 18-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reversible activation of phosphofructokinase, a major rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, has been shown to be important in this regulation(22Passonneau J.A. Lowry O.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, an intrinsic facilitation of glycolysis itself would provide little protection against a reduced oxidative pathway unless sufficient intracellular glucose is available to support the increased need of glucose consumption by glycolysis. Thus, for many mammalian cells where glucose entry is rate-limited under basal condition and glycogen storage is minimal(23Elbrink J. Bihler I. Science. 1975; 188: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the adaptive response to a reduction in oxidative metabolism must include a substantial enhancement of glucose transport(4Mercado C.L. Leob J.N. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C19-C28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such an adaptive response has been described not only in the Clone 9 cells studied here, but also in rat myocardial cells(24Morgan H.E. Henderson M.J. Regen D.M. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), muscle cells(25Randle P.J. Smith G.H. Biochem. J. 1958; 70: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), avian erythrocytes(3Shetty M. Loeb J.N. Vikstrom K. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17225-17232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wood R.E. Morgan H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1451-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and yeast (27Kleinzeller, A., Kotyk, A., (1965) in Mecanismes de Regulation des Activités Cellulaires chez les Microorganismes, pp. 371-377, Editions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris.Google Scholar) as well. Our results in the present study revealed that cytochalasin B, a potent inhibitor of GLUT1 function, binds to Clone 9 cell membranes at three distinct classes of saturable binding sites, namely, a cytochalasin E-sensitive site, a D-glucose-sensitive site, and a site insensitive to both D-glucose and cytochalasin E. Our data also show that the D-glucose-sensitive site is a glucose transporter; the KD for CB binding to this site is practically identical to the KD for CB binding to GLUT1 and also to the KI value for CB as an inhibitor of GLUT1 transport activity. These findings are reminiscent of the characteristics of the CB binding sites in human erythrocyte membranes(19Pinkofsky H.B. Rampal A.L. Cowden M.A. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4930-4937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where a D-glucose-sensitive site (site I), a CE-sensitive site (site II), and a site (site III) insensitive to both D-glucose and CE exist and where site I is GLUT1 and site II is cytoskeletal. We have shown in the present study that the amount of the CE-insensitive, D-glucose-sensitive CB binding site, presumably GLUT1 (GLUT2, 3, and 4 were not detectable in Western blots), is very small in Clone 9 cells, amounting to a low percentage of the total CB binding sites in membranes and thus barely detectable. This corresponds to 1-2 pmol/mg membrane protein. The GLUT1 content in human erythrocyte membranes has been estimated to be 300 pmol/mg protein(19Pinkofsky H.B. Rampal A.L. Cowden M.A. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4930-4937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding capacity of this site, however, increased in Clone 9 cells after acute treatment with azide to 5-7 pmol/mg membrane protein. This increase is large enough to account for most of the acute increase in glucose transport by azide(5Diamond D.L. Carruthers A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6437-6444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incidentally, the azide treatment also increases CE-insensitive CB binding capacity, and this increase is almost stoichiometric to the increase in glucose-sensitive CB binding capacity. It is interesting in this regard to recall that in human erythrocytes CB binding to site III becomes glucose-sensitive when site II is saturated or selectively removed by extraction with EDTA(18Lachaal M. Berenski C.J. Kim J. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15449-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that site III is an altered form of GLUT1 inactivated by molecular association with a cytoskeletal component. Most revealing and intriguing in the present study is the finding that the CB binding activity of purified GLUT1 is inhibited by cytosol of azide-treated Clone 9 cells. This effect is specific to the cytosol isolated from azide-treated cells and was absent in cytosol from control cells. This effect was largely abolished by the peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT1. This effect was lost after heat-treatment, suggesting that it is due to protein. One simple interpretation of these observations is that there is a cytosolic protein, X, in Clone 9 cells that interacts with the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GLUT1 to form a reversible X-GLUT1 complex where GLUT1 is incompetent to bind CB and glucose. It is further possible that the total amount of X in Clone 9 cells is rather limited and is available in copy number similar to that of GLUT1, such that practically all of X are in complex with GLUT1 in control cells and that azide treatment effectively dissociates X-GLUT1 complex releasing X almost quantitatively to the cytosol. The biochemical or physicochemical basis of the “masking” and “unmasking” of GLUT1 by X proposed above is unknown. X could be an adaptor protein whose physical interaction with GLUT1 makes GLUT1 sterically unable to bind substrate. Alternatively, X could be an enzyme that modulates GLUT1 activity via a covalent change such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation(28Reusch J.E. Sussman K.E. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3348-3351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chemical identity of X is unknown at present. It could be an intermediate of glucose metabolism that responds to the metabolic alteration secondary to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation. We have identified three proteins with apparent molecular masses of 28, 70, and 85 kDa in Clone 9 cell cytosol that bind to the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains of glucose transporters expressed as GST fusion proteins. They did not bind to irrelevant fusion proteins, indicating that the binding is specific to glucose transporters. The 28- and 70-kDa proteins were labeled by 35S but not by 32P, suggesting they are not phosphoproteins. The 28-kDa protein bound more to GLUT1 than GLUT4, whereas the 70-kDa protein binding was more intense to GLUT4. Azide treatment did not affect these protein bindings significantly. The 85-kDa protein was labeled by 32P, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. The 85-kDa protein bound only to GLUT4 fusion protein but not to GLUT1 fusion protein. One cannot rule out the possibility, however, that this protein may bind to the GLUT1 fusion protein under more appropriate experimental conditions or that it may bind to intact GLUT1. The 32P-labeling of this 85-kDa protein is seen only in azide-treated cytosol but not in control cytosol, strongly suggesting that the binding is sensitive to metabolic alteration induced by azide treatment. This is particularly interesting because the putative inhibitory factor that inactivates purified GLUT1 glucose binding is seen only in azide-treated cytosol. More experiments are needed to establish the functional significance, if any, of these glucose transporter-binding proteins. These would include purification, partial sequencing, and cloning of this protein. Once purified protein is available in a large quantity, its role in GLUT1 modulation would be directly studied by injecting the protein into Clone 9 cells"

Laminin-adherent adult feline cardiocytes were maintained in a serum-free medium and induced to contract at 1 Hz via electrical field stimulation. Electrical stimulation of contraction accelerated rates of MHC synthesis 28%, p < 0.05 by 4 h as determined by incorporation of phenylalanine into MHC. MHC mRNA expression as measured by RNase protection was unchanged after 4 h of electrical stimulation. MHC mRNA levels in messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes and translating polysomes were examined by sucrose gradient fractionation. The relative percentage of polysome-bound MHC mRNA was equal at 47% in both electrically stimulated and control cardiocytes. However, electrical stimulation of contraction resulted in a reproducible shift of MHC mRNA from smaller polysomes into larger polysomes, indicating an increased rate of initiation. This shift resulted in significant increases in MHC mRNA levels in the fractions containing the larger polysomes of electrically stimulated cardiocytes as compared with nonstimulated controls. These data indicate that the rate of MHC synthesis is accelerated in contracting cardiocytes via an increase in translational efficiency.

INTRODUCTIONHypertrophic growth occurs in terminally differentiated adult cardiocytes by an increase in cellular mass via a relatively coordinate increase in the proteins comprising each of the cellular components (1Marino T.A. Kent R.L. Uboh C.E. Fernandez E. Thompson E.W. Cooper G. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: H371-H379PubMed Google Scholar). This accumulation of cardiocyte proteins occurs by an increase in rates of protein synthesis relative to rates of protein degradation (2Morgan H.E. Gordon E.E. Kira Y. Chua B.H.L. Russo L.A. Peterson C.J. McDermott P.J. Watson P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anabolic changes that occur during hypertrophy of the adult myocardium are generally considered to be a compensatory response to an increase in hemodynamic load(3Cooper IV, G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 501-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated in studies employing isolated papillary muscle preparations, both the active tension and passive strain components of load have been identified as mechanical stimuli for accelerating protein synthesis rates in adult myocardium (4Peterson M.B. Lesch M. Circ. Res. 1972; 31: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Kent R.L. Hoober J.K. Cooper IV, G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These findings have been extended to isolated adult cardiocytes in culture. Rates of protein synthesis were accelerated in response to electrically stimulated cardiocyte contraction(6Ivester C.T. Kent R.L. Tagawa H. Tsutsui H. Imamura T. Cooper IV, G. McDermott P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H666-H674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kato S. Ivester C.T. Cooper IV, G. Zile M.R. McDermott P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H2495-H2504PubMed Google Scholar), in response to a basal load as defined by adherence of the cardiocytes to the culture dish and establishment of a resting length (8Cooper IV, G. Mercer W.E. Hoober J.K. Gordon P.R. Kent R.L. Lauva I.K. Marino T.A. Circ. Res. 1986; 58: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and in response to passive stretch of cardiocytes adherent to a deformable membrane(9Mann D.L. Kent R.L. Cooper IV, G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, the integrity of adult cardiocytes in primary culture is maintained with respect to the ability to transduce changes in mechanical load into an anabolic response such as accelerated protein synthesis rate.The specific mechanisms by which cardiocyte protein synthesis is regulated probably occur at many levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational processes(10Weisner R.J. Zak R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L179-L188PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established, for example, that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate steady state mRNA levels and are responsible for qualitative changes in gene expression during cardiac hypertrophy (11Boheler K.R. Schwartz K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1992; 2: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Ojamaa K. Petrie J.F. Balkman C. Hong C. Klein I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3468-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At the translational level, protein synthesis rates can be accelerated by changes in efficiency or capacity(2Morgan H.E. Gordon E.E. Kira Y. Chua B.H.L. Russo L.A. Peterson C.J. McDermott P.J. Watson P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nagai R. Low R.B. Stirewalt W.S. Alpert N.R. Litten R.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H325-H328PubMed Google Scholar). Translational efficiency refers to the efficiency with which the cardiocyte utilizes translational machinery such as mRNA, ribosomes, initiation factors, and elongation factors; whereas, translational capacity refers to the relative abundance of these translational components in the cardiocyte, in particular the ribosome and translation factor pools. Protein synthesis rates are accelerated by an increased translational capacity during sustained hypertrophic growth of the myocardium(2Morgan H.E. Gordon E.E. Kira Y. Chua B.H.L. Russo L.A. Peterson C.J. McDermott P.J. Watson P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Morgan H.E. Siehl D. Chua B.H.L. Lautensack-Belser N. Basic Res.

In contrast, most of the evidence for changes in translational efficiency is found in acute studies in which protein synthesis rates increased within hours after a load was imposed(5Kent R.L. Hoober J.K. Cooper IV, G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Kira Y. Kochel P.J. Gordon E.E. Morgan H.E. Am. J.

These studies suggest that cardiocyte protein synthesis could be regulated by a temporal sequence in which changes in translational efficiency are followed by sustained changes in translational capacity. In skeletal muscle, alterations in load have a marked effect on translational efficiency, particularly in the acute phase(19Booth F.W. Kirby C.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 20Booth F.W. Kirby C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: R329-R332PubMed Google Scholar, 21Thomason D.B. Biggs R.B. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: R300-R305PubMed Google Scholar). For example, unweighting of the soleus muscle in rats results in a reduction in MHC 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmyosin heavy chainPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. synthesis which has been attributed to a decrease in translational activity(21Thomason D.B. Biggs R.B. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: R300-R305PubMed Google Scholar).In previous studies employing adult feline cardiocytes in primary culture, we demonstrated that electrically stimulated contraction resulted in an acute acceleration of both total protein synthesis and MHC synthesis rates(6Ivester C.T. Kent R.L. Tagawa H. Tsutsui H. Imamura T. Cooper IV, G. McDermott P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H666-H674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence suggested that this acceleration occurred via a mechanism involving an increase in translational activity. First, protein synthesis rates were accelerated by contraction, even when transcription was blocked with actinomycin D. Second, because the effects of electrical stimulation were observed by 1 h, the acceleration of protein synthesis preceded any measurable changes in the amount of translational machinery as reflected by an increase in the ribosomal pool. In this study, MHC was used as a cardiocyte-specific marker to determine whether translational mechanisms are involved in the acute acceleration of the rate of protein synthesis in response to electrically stimulated contraction of adult cardiocytes. Comparisons were made between quiescent cardiocytes and cardiocytes electrically stimulated to contract by measuring the synthesis rate of MHC protein, the size of the MHC mRNA pool, and the translational efficiency of MHC mRNA. These studies demonstrated that: 1) rates of MHC synthesis are accelerated by electrical stimulation without a corresponding change in steady state mRNA levels, and 2) the mechanism for accelerating MHC synthesis in contracting cardiocytes is an increase in translational efficiency as reflected by a shift of MHC mRNA into larger polysomes.MATERIALS AND METHODSElectrical Stimulation ModelAdult feline cardiocytes were obtained by collagenase digestion in combination with mechanical agitation as described previously(6Ivester C.T. Kent R.L. Tagawa H. Tsutsui H. Imamura T. Cooper IV, G. McDermott P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H666-H674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cooper IV, G. Mercer W.E. Hoober J.K. Gordon P.R. Kent R.L. Lauva I.K. Marino T.A. Circ. Res. 1986; 58: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Mann D.L. Kent R.L. Cooper IV, G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Following cell isolation, the Ca2+-tolerant cardiocytes were placed in Life Technologies, Inc. M199 serum-free medium with Earle's salts at a concentration of 50,000 rod-shaped cells/ml. The cells were plated on 245 × 245-mm culture trays (Nunclone) coated with 20 μg/ml laminin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) to facilitate cell adhesion. After an overnight incubation, the medium was changed to remove nonadherent cells. The M199 medium was modified as before, and adult feline cardiocytes, which are normally quiescent in culture, were induced to contract synchronously via electrical field stimulation as described previously with modification(6Ivester C.T. Kent R.L. Tagawa H. Tsutsui H. Imamura T. Cooper IV, G. McDermott P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H666-H674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to stimulate a larger number of cardiocytes, the system was adapted according to the method of Berger et al.(22Berger H.J. Prasad S.K. Davidoff A.J. Pimental D. Ellingsen O. Marsh J.D. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H341-H349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for use with large culture trays in which electrical pulses were delivered to the medium via carbon electrodes submersed at the opposite ends of each tray (Fig. 1). The distance between electrodes was 23 cm. The polarity of the electrodes was alternated with each electrical pulse to minimize electrolysis at the electrodes. In order to set the threshold voltage for contraction, the lowest voltage required to stimulate greater than 50% of the cells was determined and then exceeded by 10%, resulting in an approximate response ratio of 70%. The resultant pulses of approximately 6 volts/cm between electrodes were delivered as a square wave for a duration of 5 ms at 1 Hz for 4 h.Measurement of Myosin Heavy Chain Synthesis RatesRates of MHC synthesis were determined by measuring incorporation of [3H]Phe into electrophoretically purified MHC. Cells were radiolabeled with 0.4 mM [3H]Phe (20 μCi/ml, Amersham Corp.) over the entire 4 h of electrical stimulation. Total cell protein was scraped in a lysis buffer consisting of: 0.4 M Trizma (Tris base) glycine, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 20% glycerol, 0.5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were boiled for 5 min and cooled to room temperature. The samples were electrophoresed on 3-mm polyacrylamide-N,N‘-diallyltartardiamide 10-13% gradient gels for 24 h at 10 V/cm. The MHC band was identified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) staining and excised. The band was solubilized in 2% periodic acid, 4% lactic acid, pH adjusted to 3.0 with NH4OH. The protein was precipitated by adding 70% HClO4 to a final concentration of 6% and centrifuged 15 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet was washed twice with 6% HClO4 and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The pellet was solubilized in 0.3 N NaOH by heating to 60°C for 1 h. Aliquots were assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting and for MHC protein by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The specific radioactivity of Phe in the medium was determined by scintillation counting of aliquots of culture medium. Previous studies have shown that the Phe-tRNA pools equilibrate to 80% of medium Phe-specific radioactivity in both electrically stimulated and quiescent cardiocytes(6Ivester C.T. Kent R.L. Tagawa H. Tsutsui H. Imamura T. Cooper IV, G. McDermott P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H666-H674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Probes for MHC mRNATwo probes were used to measure MHC mRNA levels. For RNase protection assays, [32P]UTP-labeled antisense cRNA probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription from a 436-base pair fragment (p-MHC-5) of the rat α-MHC cDNA inserted into a pGEM-3Zf(+) plasmid(23Dillmann W.H. Barrieux A. Shanker R. Endocr. Res. 1989; 15: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This region of α-MHC mRNA extends from nucleotides 3459 through 3895 of the coding sequence and is highly conserved as indicated by a 90% sequence similarity to rat β-MHC mRNA and an 89% sequence similarity to human β-MHC mRNA. In the ventricle of adult cat, it has been demonstrated that the β-MHC isoform is expressed exclusively(24Wisenbaugh T. Allen P. Cooper IV, G. O'Connor W.N. Mezaros L. Streter F. Bahinski A. Houser S. Spann J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: H146-H154PubMed Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the degree of homology of the probe was the same for feline β-MHC mRNA, a partial cDNA clone for feline β-MHC was isolated from an adult feline cardiocyte cDNA library. The identity of the cDNA clone as the β-MHC isoform was based upon the high degree of sequence similarity to the 3′-untranslated regions of the rat and human β-MHC mRNA isoforms. Sequence analysis of the region extending between nucleotides 3459-3714 revealed that the degree of homology of feline β-MHC to rat α-MHC is 92%, the same as for rat β-MHC. 2W. J. Tuxworth and P. J. McDermott, unpublished data. RNase protection using total RNA extracted from adult cardiocytes yielded a protected band of approximately 83 nucleotides, the same size band observed for rat β-MHC mRNA.For the slot-blotting analyses, a 215-base pair cDNA clone of feline cardiac β-MHC mRNA was employed. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the feline species was greater than 92% similar to rat β-MHC mRNA in the region between nucleotides 4028 and 4243 and to human β-MHC in the region between 4017 and 4232. The cDNA insert was subsequently subcloned into a pGEM-3Zf(+) plasmid. [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers complementary to the T7 and SP6 promoter regions flanking either side of the cDNA insert.Quantitation of MHC mRNA ExpressionTotal cellular RNA was extracted from cell cultures via the RNAzol method (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.), and MHC mRNA was quantified by an RNase protection assay as follows. The RNA was resuspended in hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 40 mM Pipes, pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 400 mM NaCl. Aliquots were taken for determination of 28 S rRNA by slot blotting as described previously(25Johnson T.B. Kent R.L. Bubolz B.A. McDermott P.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 448-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Antisense cRNA probe was added in excess, and the samples were denatured 15 min at 85°C. RNA was solution hybridized 18 h at 47°C followed by S1 nuclease digestion of nonhybridized RNA for 2 h with 300 μl of digestion buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 280 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM ZnSO4, 250 units/ml S1 nuclease (Promega)). Reactions were terminated with 50 μl of stop buffer (4 M ammonium acetate, 100 mM EDTA). The samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted and precipitated in ethanol with 20 μg of Escherichia coli tRNA as carrier. The samples were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 80% formamide, 10 mM EDTA. Samples were denatured for 10 min at 65°C and electrophoresed on 8 M urea, 4% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were washed, dried, and processed for autoradiography. The protected MHC mRNA band was quantified by computer-assisted image analysis of autoradiograms and normalized to the corresponding amount of 28 S rRNA/sample as determined by slot blotting.Quantitation of MHC mRNA in Polysome FractionsCardiocyte cultures were rinsed three times on ice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to which 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to arrest polypeptide chain elongation. Cardiocytes were scraped from the culture trays twice in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/cycloheximide, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1 ml of resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100). The resuspended cells were homogenized with 18 strokes of a glass A pestle Dounce homogenizer and transferred to a chilled 1.5-ml microtube. 150 μl of a solution containing 10% (v/v) Tween 80, 5% (w/v) deoxycholate was added, and the homogenate was vortexed and incubated on ice for 15 min. Homogenates were centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 × g to pellet nuclei, mitochondria, and insoluble proteins. The polysome distribution of MHC mRNA was measured by two methods, RNase protection and slot blotting.To prepare polysomes for RNase protection assays, post-mitochondrial supernatants were layered onto 15-50% linear sucrose gradients and centrifuged for 95 min at 32,000 rpm in an SW-41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Gradients were fractionated into seven fractions of 1.2 ml each, starting with the 40 S subunit peak, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation using tRNA as carrier. MHC mRNA levels in each fraction were determined by the RNase protection assay as described above. Prior to hybridization, aliquots were taken to measure 28 S rRNA by slot blotting.Polysomes were prepared for the slot blotting method by layering the post-mitochondrial supernatants on sucrose gradients and centrifuging for 95 min at 35,000 rpm in an SW-41 rotor. The gradients were fractionated into eight fractions of 1.2 ml each starting with the top of the gradient. The samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The RNA was resuspended in 67% formamide, 7% (v/v) formaldehyde, 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 3 mM EDTA, 0.8 mM sodium acetate and heated at 60°C for 10 min. The RNA was immobilized on Hybond-N membranes (Amersham) by means of a slot blotting apparatus and UV cross-linked. The blots were hybridized at 42°C in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Na4P2O7, 1% SDS, 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA/ml and 32P-labeled feline MHC cDNA probe in excess. The blots were washed three times over 1 h with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C, followed by three more washes over 1 h at 70°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The membranes were processed for autoradiography and the optical density of the hybridization signals were measured by computer-assisted image analysis. In order to normalize the MHC signal to the amount of RNA recovered in the polysome fractions, the blots were stripped and hybridized to the 28 S rDNA probe. The 28 S rRNA signal was processed for autoradiography and measured by computer-assisted image analysis.Quantitation of Subunit RNAPost-mitochondrial supernatants were prepared from electrically stimulated and quiescent cultures as described above for polysomes. A 150-μl aliquot of the post-mitochondrial supernatant was removed to assay for total RNA and a 900-μl aliquot was layered onto 10 ml of 15-68% exponential sucrose gradients. Gradients were centrifuged 18 h in a Sorvall SW-41 rotor at 37,000 rpm, and 40 and 60 S subunit peaks were collected by gradient fractionation and pooled. Total RNA and RNA in subunits were assayed by the method of Munro and Fleck(26Munro H. Fleck A. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1966; 14: 113-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and RNA in subunits was calculated as a percentage of total RNA(15Siehl D. Chua B.H.L. Lautensack-Belser N. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: C309-C319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Munro H. Fleck A. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1966; 14: 113-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using Stat-View 4.0 software (Abacus Concepts Inc.). Because the two experimental groups of cardiocytes were derived from the same preparation, differences between nonstimulated and electrically stimulated groups were determined using a paired Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be a significant difference.RESULTSWe have demonstrated previously that contraction induced by electrical stimulation accelerated rates of total protein synthesis and fractional rates of MHC synthesis. In the present studies, relatively large numbers of cardiocytes were needed for the preparation of polysomes and RNA. The system was adapted to electrically stimulate large trays of cardiocytes with the use of carbon electrodes (Fig. 1). In order to validate that the same acute anabolic response as observed before (6Ivester C.T. Kent R.L. Tagawa H. Tsutsui H. Imamura T. Cooper IV, G. McDermott P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H666-H674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was elicited in cardiocytes using this system, rates of MHC synthesis were measured over 4 h of electrically stimulated contraction and compared with nonstimulated controls. In agreement with previous studies, contraction acutely accelerated the rate of MHC synthesis as compared with nonstimulated controls (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Effect of contraction on MHC synthesis rates. Rates of MHC synthesis were determined after 4 h of labeling in electrically stimulated and quiescent cardiocytes. Asterisk, significant difference, p < 0.05 as determined by a paired Student's t test. Values are mean ± S.E., n = 8 cardiocyte preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to determine whether the acceleration of MHC synthesis was due to an increase in MHC mRNA levels, MHC mRNA expression was quantified using an RNase protection assay. In Fig. 3, two controls for the RNase protection assay are shown. In Fig. 3A (lane 1), it is demonstrated that the antisense cRNA probe derived from rat α-MHC cDNA hybridized specifically to feline β-MHC mRNA, the isoform expressed in adult feline cardiocytes. As indicated under “Materials and Methods,” this reflects the fact that the probe is derived from a region that is highly conserved between α- and β-MHC isoforms. In lane 2, the specificity of the feline β-MHC cDNA probe used for slot-blot analysis is shown. In Fig. 3B, the linearity of the RNase protection assay is demonstrated by plotting the hybridization signal of the protected MHC band as a function of the amount of total feline cardiocyte RNA added to the assay. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of the assay for detecting changes in MHC mRNA levels in feline cardiocyte mRNA.Figure 3:Specificity of probes for feline cardiac MHC mRNA. A, Northern blots showing the specificity of the rat α-MHC cRNA probe (lane 1) and the feline β-MHC cDNA probe (lane 2). 15 μg of total RNA extracted from adult cat ventricle was run per lane. B, linearity of the RNase protection assay for MHC mRNA levels in adult feline cardiocytes. Total RNA was extracted from quiescent cardiocytes and added to the assay in the indicated amounts. The optical density of the protected MHC band on the autoradiogram was measured by computer-assisted digital image analysis. R2 = 0.99.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Fig. 4, MHC mRNA levels were compared between electrically stimulated (S) and nonstimulated controls (C) in each of six experiments. Fig. 4A is an autoradiogram showing the MHC bands following RNase protection. In order to normalize for the amount of total RNA that was recovered and added to the assay, aliquots of each diluted sample were slot-blotted and probed for 28 S rRNA. The summary data of MHC mRNA normalized to 28 S rRNA are shown in Fig. 4B. These data demonstrate that electrically stimulated contraction did not significantly alter MHC mRNA levels. A difference in the MHC signal, such as that observed in experiment number 2, was the result of a differential recovery of total RNA extracted from the cardiocytes. There was not a difference in MHC levels in this particular experiment when corrected for the amount of 28 S rRNA added to the assay. Thus, the acceleration of MHC synthesis measured after 4 h of electrical stimulation occurred without any significant changes in MHC mRNA levels.Figure 4:MHC mRNA content in quiescent and electrically stimulated cardiocytes. A, a representative autoradiogram of an RNase protection assay for MHC. Total RNA in stimulated (S) and control (C) cultures from six different experimental preparations was assayed. B, summary data of digital image analysis of the autoradiogram in A. Optical densities were normalized to 28 S rRNA in each sample. There was no significant difference between the two groups as determined by a Student's t test. Values are the mean ± S.E., n = 6 cardiocyte preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because rates of MHC synthesis were accelerated without a change in MHC mRNA, we examined whether the existing MHC mRNA pool was utilized more efficiently for protein synthesis in electrically stimulated cardiocytes. In order to determine the relative amount of the MHC mRNA pool active in translation, we quantified the amount of MHC mRNA that was located in the bound, polysome fractions and in the free, non-polysome fractions of the gradients. Post-mitochondrial supernatants prepared from whole cell extracts were layered onto 15-50% linear sucrose gradients and centrifuged. The gradients were fractionated into a lighter fraction containing mRNP particles, 40 S and 60 S subunits and 80 S ribosomes, and a heavier fraction containing polysomes (refer to absorbance tracing in Fig. 6A). As demonstrated in Fig. 5A, the amounts of MHC mRNA recovered in the free (F) and polysome-bound (B) fractions were the same in electrically stimulated and nonstimulated cardiocytes. Summary data from four experiments are shown in Fig. 5B, confirming that approximately equal amounts of total MHC mRNA were present in the actively translating polysome region of the gradients in both electrically stimulated and nonstimulated cardiocytes. The same results were obtained when MHC mRNA levels were normalized to recovered 28 S rRNA (data not shown). Thus, the acceleration of MHC synthesis was not accounted for by a significant mobilization of MHC mRNA into polysomes.Figure 6:Effects of electrically stimulated contraction on the distribution of MHC mRNA in polysome gradients.

A cis-acting element, located 3646 base pairs upstream of the start of tyrosine aminotransferase gene transcription, has been found to be sufficient to reproduce these variations with heterologous genes and promoters (Oshima, H., and Simons, S. S., Jr.(1992) Mol. Endocrinol. 6, 416-428). This element has been called a glucocorticoid modulatory element, or GME. Others have called this sequence a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) due to the binding of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). We now report the partial purification and characterization of two new proteins (GMEB1 and −2) of 88 and 67 kDa that bind to the GME/CRE as a heteromeric complex. This purification was followed by the formation of a previously characterized, biologically relevant band in gel shift assays. By several biochemical criteria, the GMEBs differed from many of the previously described CREB/CREM/ATF family members. Partial peptide sequencing revealed that the sequences of these two proteins have not yet been described. Size exclusion chromatography and molecular weight measurements of the gel-shifted band demonstrated that the GMEBs bound to the GME as a macromolecular complex of about 550 kDa that could be dissociated by deoxycholate. Similar experiments showed that CREB bound to the GME as heteromeric complexes of about 310 and 360 kDa. As determined from gel shift assays, GMEB1 and −2 are not restricted to rat liver cells but appear to be ubiquitous. Thus, these novel GMEBs may participate in a similar modulation of other glucocorticoid-inducible genes in a variety of cells.

INTRODUCTIONFor many years, the accepted model of steroid hormone action predicted that the responses of all regulated genes were a property of the steroid used. Thus, a gene is induced, or repressed, by agonists, and the action of agonists is prevented by antisteroids. Furthermore, the concentration of steroid required for half-maximal induction by an agonist and the amount of agonist activity possessed by a given antisteroid should be constant for each steroid and independent of the gene examined (reviewed in (1Simons Jr., S.S. Mercier L. Miller N.R. Miller P.A. Oshima H. Sistare F.D. Thompson E.B. Wasner G. Yen P.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2244-2252PubMed Google Scholar) and (2Simons Jr., S.S. Oshima H. Szapary D. Mol.

Thus, jun•fos heterodimers (AP-1), and AP-1 inducers such as phorbol esters block steroid induction (3Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K-K. Cato A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P.

Shen P. Greene M.J. Housley P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 408-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), while the immunosuppressive agent FK506 augmented the activity of subsaturating concentrations of glucocorticoids(14Ning Y-M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6073-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, dopamine can cause ligand-independent gene activation of some receptors(15Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). None of the above agents effected any shift in the dose-response curve for agonists except for FK506, which was postulated to increase the nuclear binding of activated complexes(14Ning Y-M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6073-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Other observations that did not appear to fit with the conventional model of steroid hormone action originated from studies on glucocorticoid induction of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) 1The abbreviations used are: TATtyrosine aminotransferasebpbase pair(s)CREBcyclic AMP response element binding proteinGMEglucocorticoid modulatory elementHTChepatoma tissue cultureCREcyclic AMP-responsive elementFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyCBPCREB binding proteinGREglucocorticoid response elementCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. gene in rat hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells, which had become a paradigm for steroid-inducible genes. We found that the dose-response curve for dexamethasone induction of TAT gene expression in the related Fu5-5 rat hepatoma cell line was left shifted compared to that in HTC cells(16Mercier L. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similarly, TAT enzyme activity was induced at lower cAMP concentrations in Fu5-5 cells than in HTC cells(7Wasner G. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all antiglucocorticoids examined displayed a higher percentage of agonist activity for TAT gene expression in Fu5-5 than in HTC cells(16Mercier L. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Mercier L. Miller P.A. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Simons Jr., S.S. Yen P.M. Spelsberg T.C. Kumar R. Steroid and Sterol Hormone Action. M. Nijhoff, Boston1987: 251-268Crossref Google Scholar). This left shift in the TAT dose-response curve, and increased agonist activity with antisteroids, was not a general response of all glucocorticoid-inducible genes in Fu5-5 cells (19Wasner G. Oshima H. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and occurred at the level of correctly initiated transcripts(7Wasner G. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 19Wasner G. Oshima H. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the magnitudes both of the left shift in the dose-response curve and of the increased amount of agonist activity were not constant but varied slowly over time (17Mercier L. Miller P.A. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Simons Jr., S.S. Miller P.A. Wasner G. Miller N.R. Mercier L. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in a manner that was eventually found to be related to the density of the cells in culture(21Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appeared that some event downstream of steroid binding to the glucocorticoid receptor selectively modulated the properties of TAT gene induction by glucocorticoid agonists and antagonists.We previously proposed that this modulation of TAT gene induction in rat hepatoma cells occurred via the binding of a trans-acting factor to a cis-acting element of the TAT gene(1Simons Jr., S.S. Mercier L. Miller N.R. Miller P.A. Oshima H. Sistare F.D. Thompson E.B. Wasner G. Yen P.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2244-2252PubMed Google Scholar). Stable (22Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3492-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and transient (23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar) transfection assays succeeded in identifying such a cis-acting element, at about −3646 bp of the rat TAT gene, that conveyed all of the glucocorticoid induction properties of the endogenous TAT gene to heterologous genes and promoters. This cis-acting element was called a glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME) and was found to bind a trans-acting factor(s)(23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of the GME, unlike that of the commonly discussed transcription factor binding sites, does not involve synergism with the glucocorticoid response element, or GRE(24Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the GME-bound factor(s) (GMEB) might be a novel protein.The binding site of the GMEB has also been identified as a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)(25Boshart M. Weih F. Schimdt A. Fournier R.E.K. Schutz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M.

A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but several lines of evidence indicate that two different sets of proteins are responsible for GME and CRE activity. First, the biological activities mediated by GMEB and the CRE binding protein (CREB) are quite dissimilar ((21Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 22Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3492-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar) versus 25, 28). Second, no additional element is needed for GME biological activity, while a functional CRE requires a second TAT gene sequence, initially called BIII (25Boshart M. Weih F. Schimdt A. Fournier R.E.K. Schutz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and more recently found to bind HNF-4(27Nitsch D. Boshart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Third, both the GME (23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar) and the CRE (28Weih F. Stewart A.F. Boshart M. Nitsch D. Schutz G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) give a closely spaced, three-band pattern in gel shift assays. However, the GMEB is responsible for slowest migrating of the three bands (23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown not to contain CREB(26Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).The GME contains the sequence CGTCA, which is a common CRE element that binds homo- and heterodimers of CREB/ATF along with other family members or unrelated proteins (29Shepard A.R. Zhang W. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1804-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such as AP-1(30Ray A. Sassone-Corsi P. Sehgal P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5537-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, many known and unknown trans-acting factors could bind to the GME/CRE site at −3646 bp of the TAT gene. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to characterize and purify the binding protein(s) proposed to be responsible for the GME activity of modulating glucocorticoid receptor function.DISCUSSIONWe have called the element at −3.6 kilobases of the rat TAT gene a glucocorticoid modulatory element, or GME, because it modulates the induction properties of both subsaturating concentrations of agonists and saturating concentrations of antagonists(23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of a protein(s) to the GME was observed that was directly related to the biological activity of the GME oligonucleotide(23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar, 24Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was different from synergism(24Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that the GMEB appears to be a heterooligomer of two previously unsequenced proteins, GMEB1 and GMEB2, of apparent molecular masses of 88 and 67 kDa, respectively. However, conclusive identification must await the cloning of both proteins and a demonstration of biological activity with the cloned proteins in cells lacking GMEBs.Several properties of the GMEBs emerged during their purification that pertain to the mechanism of GME action. First, although the DNA sequence to which the GMEBs bind is very similar to that for the CREB/CREM/ATF and the Jun/Fos/AP-1 superfamilies, and CREB even binds to a non-consensus CRE at the same position as the GME at −3646 bp of the TAT gene(25Boshart M. Weih F. Schimdt A. Fournier R.E.K. Schutz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B.

A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), there is little similarity between the GMEBs and these other proteins. The GMEBs are not related to CREB by the criteria of size, biological activity(23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar, 24Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), antibody reactivity, methylation interference patterns for protein binding (Fig. 2A versus Fig. 7 of (28Weih F. Stewart A.F. Boshart M. Nitsch D. Schutz G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)), or amino acid sequence (Table 3). Some AP-1 sites contain the CGTC of the GME, and AP-1 may bind to the GME/CRE, as it has recently been reported that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate both inhibited glucocorticoid (and cAMP) induction of TAT and caused a decreased protein occupancy of the CRE at −3646 bp(45Reik A. Stewart A.F. Schutz G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 490-497PubMed Google Scholar). However, again there was no similarity between the peptide sequences of the GMEBs and AP-1, an anti-AP-1 antibody did not cause a supershift of GMEB-GME complexes, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate alone did not elicit any response from GME-containing constructs (data not shown). Thus, there is little physical or biological similarity between the GMEBs and the other factors binding to the same DNA sequence. This, then, is an additional example of different proteins that bind to the same DNA region(46Steitz T.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 205-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 47Harrison S.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).Second, we do not know if GMEB and CREB can both bind to the GME/CRE at the same time. However, it seems that CREB is unable to block GMEB action. The low levels of the protein kinase A regulatory subunit (Tse-1) in liver cells are thought to result in high amounts of active CREB that would bind to the GME/CRE(48Jones K.W. Shapero M.H. Chevrette M. Fournier R.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, reporter constructs containing either a single GME (GMEGREtkCAT) or other elements that are needed for CRE activity, such as multiple tandem repeats of the GME or the GME plus the downstream BIII sequence(25Boshart M. Weih F. Schimdt A. Fournier R.E.K. Schutz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), show full GME activity in Fu5-5 rat hepatoma cells(23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, conditions that elevate protein kinase A activity, such as forskolin treatment, did not inhibit GME activity. Thus, while CREB binds to the same DNA sequence as GMEB, CREB does not appear to competitively inhibit GMEB binding in intact cells.Third, GME activity is not limited to rat liver cells (Table 1), and the GMEBs are not tissue-specific proteins (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the fact that the GME was active with synthetic GREs and a variety of promoters, including a minimum thymidine kinase promoter (23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that no tissue-specific DNA binding factors are required for GME activity.Fourth, the GMEBs are clearly of nuclear origin but can be readily extracted from nuclei under conditions where other factors, such as CREB, stay in the nucleus. This is reminiscent of several other nuclear proteins(49Guiochon-Mantel A. Delabre K. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7179-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), including the progesterone and estrogen receptors, which are predominantly nuclear but appear in most cytosolic preparations. The cytosolic appearance of the GMEBs could be indicative of a dynamic equilibrium between the two cellular compartments, as established for the progesterone receptors(49Guiochon-Mantel A. Delabre K. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7179-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 50Guiochon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Martre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 51Chandran U.R. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 837-844PubMed Google Scholar), or may simply reflect a repartitioning of the GMEBs in the lysis buffer.Fifth, the mass and stability of the GMEB complex are notable. The 550-600-kDa size of the protein complex seen in both gel shift assays and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3, A and B) argue against a nonspecific aggregate. Involvement of the 265-kDa protein CBP that binds phosphorylated CREB (52Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar) was discounted by the observed sizes of GMEB1 and −2 and their lack of immunoreactivity with anti-CBP antibody. The most purified preparation of GMEB appeared to contain about equal amounts of GMEB1 and −2 (Fig. 5A), which would require three or four molecules of each protein in the final complex to achieve a molecular mass of 550-600 kDa. Such a massive complex is probably not too large to be extracted intact from HTC cell nuclei because identically prepared nuclei were found to be permeable to molecules as large as the 240-kDa protein complex of phycoerythrin(53Miyashita Y. Miller M. Yen P.M. Harmon J.M. Hanover J.A. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the GMEB complex must be quite stable to retain specific binding to the GME after extraction from the nucleus (Fig. 1), even in the presence of up to 2.7 M guanidinium hydrochloride and after various degrees of purification (Table 2). Despite the stability of the GMEB complex with regard to dissociation, the rate of reassociation of the separated components was relatively slow (Fig. 4).Finally, from the yield of purified GMEB1 and −2 in Table 3, it can be calculated that there are about 40,000 molecules of each GMEB per HTC cell. This is similar to the approximately 80,000 molecules of glucocorticoid receptor that are present in an HTC cell(16Mercier L. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Considering the fact that most glucocorticoid-responsive genes contain two GREs, each of which binds a dimer of the receptor, the ratio of GME-bound GMEB complexes to GRE-bound receptors is about 1:2. Given the facts that the GMEBs are not limited to rat liver cells and that GME-like modulation has been observed with several other glucocorticoid regulated genes(2Simons Jr., S.S. Oshima H. Szapary D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar), it will be interesting to pursue the possible role of a GME and its heteromeric binding complex in the transcription of genes other than TAT.While CREB has been identified as a component that also binds to the DNA sequence of the GME/CRE(26Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), it is not known if it is the only protein in the complex. Several lines of evidence argue that the CREB-containing complexes bound to the GME are also multimeric. Most obvious is the size of the CREB-containing complexes, which were ~310-360 kDa in gel shift assays and 400 kDa on size exclusion columns (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Deoxycholate blocked the formation of the CREB-containing bands in gel shift assays, just as was observed for GMEB (Fig. 3B). Given the fact that CREB is relatively small (~42 kDa), it would seem that the CREB complexes must contain either multiple copies of CREB or other proteins. CREB will bind to the GME-containing oligonucleotide in Southwestern blots (see “Results”) and will afford gel-shifted bands with a CRE-containing oligonucleotide (26Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) so that homooligomeric complexes of CREB may form. However, the gel-shifted band that the somatostatin CRE formed with purified CREB exhibited a faster migration than that with crude nuclear extracts(26Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, the CREB-containing complex from nuclear extracts probably is not the same as that formed just from CREB and would contain some other protein(s). Further experiments are required to determine whether the suspected additional proteins are CBP (52Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), other members of the CREB/CREM/ATF superfamily that can heterodimerize with CREB(39Hummler E. Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Ganss R. Aguzzi A. Schmid W. Beermann F. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), or even GMEB1 or −2.In summary, we have found that a heteromeric complex of two potentially new proteins binds to a cis-acting element of the TAT gene. These two proteins, GMEB1 and GMEB2, are associated with changes in the transcriptional activity of antiglucocorticoids and low concentrations of glucocorticoids. These are phenomena that have not been previously described for steroid receptors and thus are of considerable mechanistic interest. It remains to be seen whether the GMEBs interact with glucocorticoid receptors and the transcriptional machinery in the manner that we have proposed(2Simons Jr., S.S. Oshima H. Szapary D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar, 23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of GMEB1 and GMEB2 and the production of specific antibodies will be of major assistance in understanding the mechanistic details of this interesting system. INTRODUCTIONFor many years, the accepted model of steroid hormone action predicted that the responses of all regulated genes were a property of the steroid used. Thus, a gene is induced, or repressed, by agonists, and the action of agonists is prevented by antisteroids. Furthermore, the concentration of steroid required for half-maximal induction by an agonist and the amount of agonist activity possessed by a given antisteroid should be constant for each steroid and independent of the gene examined (reviewed in (1Simons Jr., S.S. Mercier L. Miller N.R. Miller P.A. Oshima H. Sistare F.D. Thompson E.B. Wasner G. Yen P.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2244-2252PubMed Google Scholar) and (2Simons Jr., S.S. Oshima H. Szapary D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar)).Recently, this model has had to be modified as exceptions were defined. Thus, jun•fos heterodimers (AP-1), and AP-1 inducers such as phorbol esters block steroid induction (3Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K-K. Cato A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increased percentages of agonist activity for antisteroids(11Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Heat shock, or chemical shock, afforded a synergistic increase in glucocorticoid inducibility(13Sanchez E.R. Hu J-L. Zhong S. Shen P. Greene M.J. Housley P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 408-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), while the immunosuppressive agent FK506 augmented the activity of subsaturating concentrations of glucocorticoids(14Ning Y-M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6073-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, dopamine can cause ligand-independent gene activation of some receptors(15Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). None of the above agents effected any shift in the dose-response curve for agonists except for FK506, which was postulated to increase the nuclear binding of activated complexes(14Ning Y-M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6073-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Other observations that did not appear to fit with the conventional model of steroid hormone action originated from studies on glucocorticoid induction of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) 1The abbreviations used are: TATtyrosine aminotransferasebpbase pair(s)CREBcyclic AMP response element binding proteinGMEglucocorticoid modulatory elementHTChepatoma tissue cultureCREcyclic AMP-responsive elementFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyCBPCREB binding proteinGREglucocorticoid response elementCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. gene in rat hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells, which had become a paradigm for steroid-inducible genes. We found that the dose-response curve for dexamethasone induction of TAT gene expression in the related Fu5-5 rat hepatoma cell line was left shifted compared to that in HTC cells(16Mercier L. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similarly, TAT enzyme activity was induced at lower cAMP concentrations in Fu5-5 cells than in HTC cells(7Wasner G. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all antiglucocorticoids examined displayed a higher percentage of agonist activity for TAT gene expression in Fu5-5 than in HTC cells(16Mercier L. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Mercier L. Miller P.A. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Simons Jr., S.S. Yen P.M. Spelsberg T.C. Kumar R. Steroid and Sterol Hormone Action. M. Nijhoff, Boston1987: 251-268Crossref Google Scholar). This left shift in the TAT dose-response curve, and increased agonist activity with antisteroids, was not a general response of all glucocorticoid-inducible genes in Fu5-5 cells (19Wasner G. Oshima H. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and occurred at the level of correctly initiated transcripts(7Wasner G. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 19Wasner G. Oshima H. Thompson E.B. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the magnitudes both of the left shift in the dose-response curve and of the increased amount of agonist activity were not constant but varied slowly over time (17Mercier L. Miller P.A. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Simons Jr., S.S. Miller P.A. Wasner G. Miller N.R. Mercier L. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in a manner that was eventually found to be related to the density of the cells in culture(21Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appeared that some event downstream of steroid binding to the glucocorticoid receptor selectively modulated the properties of TAT gene induction by glucocorticoid agonists and antagonists.We previously proposed that this modulation of TAT gene induction in rat hepatoma cells occurred via the binding of a trans-acting factor to a cis-acting element of the TAT gene(1Simons Jr., S.S. Mercier L. Miller N.R. Miller P.A. Oshima H. Sistare F.D. Thompson E.B. Wasner G. Yen P.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2244-2252PubMed Google Scholar). Stable (22Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3492-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and transient (23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar) transfection assays succeeded in identifying such a cis-acting element, at about −3646 bp of the rat TAT gene, that conveyed all of the glucocorticoid induction properties of the endogenous TAT gene to heterologous genes and promoters. This cis-acting element was called a glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME) and was found to bind a trans-acting factor(s)(23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of the GME, unlike that of the commonly discussed transcription factor binding sites, does not involve synergism with the glucocorticoid response element, or GRE(24Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26858-26865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the GME-bound factor(s) (GMEB) might be a novel protein.The binding site of the GMEB has also been identified as a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)(25Boshart M. Weih F. Schimdt A. Fournier R.E.K. Schutz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 27Nitsch D. Boshart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but several lines of evidence indicate that two different sets of proteins are responsible for GME and CRE activity. First, the biological activities mediated by GMEB and the CRE binding protein (CREB) are quite dissimilar ((21Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2106-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 22Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3492-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar) versus 25, 28). Second, no additional element is needed for GME biological activity, while a functional CRE requires a second TAT gene sequence, initially called BIII (25Boshart M. Weih F. Schimdt A. Fournier R.E.K. Schutz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and more recently found to bind HNF-4(27Nitsch D. Boshart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Third, both the GME (23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar) and the CRE (28Weih F. Stewart A.F. Boshart M. Nitsch D. Schutz G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) give a closely spaced, three-band pattern in gel shift assays. However, the GMEB is responsible for slowest migrating of the three bands (23Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown not to contain CREB(26Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).The GME contains the sequence CGTCA, which is a common CRE element that binds homo- and heterodimers of CREB/ATF along with other family members or unrelated proteins (29Shepard A.R. Zhang W. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1804-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such as AP-1(30Ray A. Sassone-Corsi P. Sehgal P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5537-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, many known and unknown trans-acting factors could bind to the GME/CRE site at −3646 bp of the TAT gene. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to characterize and purify the binding protein(s) proposed to be responsible for the GME activity of modulating glucocorticoid receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2066904649,"We recently reported that Δ12-prostaglandin (PG) J2 caused various cells to synthesize heme oxygenase, HO-1 (Koizumi, T., Negishi, M., and Ichikawa, A.(1992) Prostaglandins 43, 121-131). Here we examined the molecular mechanism underlying the Δ12-PGJ2-induced HO-1 synthesis. Δ12-PGJ2 markedly stimulated the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the rat HO-1 gene from −810 to +101 in rat basophilic leukemia cells. From functional analysis of various deletion mutant genes we found that the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element was localized in a region from −690 to −660, containing an E-box motif, which was essential for the Δ12-PGJ2-stimulated promoter activity. When the region containing the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element was combined with a heterologous promoter, SV40 promoter, in the sense and antisense direction, the element showed an enhancer activity in response to Δ12-PGJ2. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that Δ12-PGJ2 specifically stimulated the binding of two nuclear proteins to the E-box motif of this region. These results indicate that Δ12-PGJ2 induces the expression of the rat HO-1 gene through nuclear protein binding to a specific element having an E-box motif.

Eicosanoids are divided into two groups, conventional eicosanoids and cyclopentenone-type prostaglandins (PGs) 1The abbreviations used are: PGprostaglandinRBLrat basophilic leukemiaPCRpolymerase chain reactionCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseHSEheat-shock elementMREmetal-responsive elementHSFheat shock factorHSPheat shock proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. according to their mechanisms of action. Conventional eicosanoids, such as PGE2 and PGD2, act on a cell surface receptor to exert their actions, and the molecular structures of their receptors have been revealed recently(2Negishi M. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cyclopentenone PGs, such as Δ12-PGJ2 and PGA2, have no cell surface receptor, but are actively transported into cells and accumulated in nuclei, where they act as potent inducers of cell growth inhibition and cell differentiation(3Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The actions of cyclopentenone PGs are attributed to the synthesis of the various proteins induced by them, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs)(4Ohno K. Fukushima M. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19764-19770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heme oxygenase is one of the most prominent proteins induced by Δ12-PGJ2, and it is a key enzyme in heme catabolism, oxidatively clearing heme to yield biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide(10Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological functions of this enzyme are the production of biliverdin as a physiological antioxidant and the conservation of the iron(11Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). Furthermore, carbon monoxide produced on the enzymatic degradation of heme has been suggested to function as a neural messenger(12Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Two isozymes of heme oxygenase, HO-1 and HO-2, have been identified(13Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). HO-2 is constitutively expressed, while HO-1 is drastically induced in response to a variety of stresses, including heavy metals, heat shock, and UV irradiation(14Kikuchi G. Yoshida T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 53/54: 163-183Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We previously found that Δ12-PGJ2 preferentially induced the synthesis of HO-1 in various cells involved in the reticuloendothelial system, in which active degradation of heme by HO-1 takes place during inflammation(9Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Prostaglandins. 1992; 43: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Koizumi T. Yamauchi R. Irie A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying Δ12-PGJ2-induced protein synthesis, we examined the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 on the promoter activity of the HO-1 gene. We report here that Δ12-PGJ2 induces the expression of the rat HO-1 gene through nuclear protein binding to a specific Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element, located 660 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site. Δ12-PGJ2 was a generous gift from Teijin Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Δ7-PGA1 was kindly supplied by Dr. M. Suzuki of Gifu University. pUC00CAT was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Other agents were obtained from commercial sources, as follows: [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), DuPont NEN; [14C]1-deoxychloramphenicol (54 mCi/mmol), Amersham; PGE2, PGE1, PGF2α, PGI2, PGD2, PGA1, and PGA2, Funakoshi Pharmaceuticals (Tokyo, Japan); and staurosporine, acetyl-CoA, and hemin, Sigma. The sources of other materials are given in the text. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM glutamine, 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. Total RNA from RBL-2H3 cells was isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method(16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and 5 μg of each RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled fragment, corresponding to exon 3 of the rat HO-1 gene. The same filter was rehybridized with 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (Clontech). Hybridization was carried out at 68°C in 6 × SSC, and the filter was washed at 68°C in 2 × SSC. The filter was autoradiographed with x-ray film (Fuji RX). The radioactivity was determined with a Fuji BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo). The 5′-flanking region of the rat HO-1 gene (nucleotide residues −810 to +101, relative to the transcription start site) was obtained by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA prepared from RBL-2H3 cells, as described previously(17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.30Google Scholar). The PCR primers with restriction enzyme sites (BamHI for the forward primer and SalI for the reverse one) were designed according to the published sequence of the rat HO-1 gene(18Müller R.M. Taguchi H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BamHI/SalI fragment of the PCR product was first constructed into pBluescript II (Stratagene), and then the SacI/KpnI insert was constructed into pUC00CAT to generate plasmid RHO810, containing the 5′-flanking region of the HO-1 gene, upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. The sequence of the cloned 5′-flanking region was confirmed by sequence analysis using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Successive deletion plasmids as to the 5′-flanking region, RHO600 (−600 to +101), RHO320 (−320 to +101), RHO270 (−270 to +101), RHO-0 (+1 to +101), and RHO810-600 (−810 to −600), were also generated by PCR using the respective forward primers with a BamHI site. To prepare a deletion plasmid without region (−600 to −270), two DNA fragments (−810 to −600, and −270 to +101) were prepared by PCR and tandemly constructed into pUC00CAT. For the functional analysis using a heterologous promoter, the 5′-flanking region from −810 to −600 was inserted into pCAT promoter vector (Promega), which carries the SV40 promoter upstream from the CAT gene, and the DNA fragment from −810 to −600 was located upstream from the SV40 promoter, in the sense (pCAT-HOs) and antisense direction (pCAT-HOa). RBL-2H3 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid DNA constructs by the DEAE-dextran method (19Lopata M.A. Cleaveland D.W. Soller-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). After the cells (4 × 106 cells/assay) had been incubated for 30 min at 37°C in 0.5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μg of DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), they were incubated for 10 min at 37°C with a dimethyl sulfoxide-hypertonic solution (28 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.4 M sucrose, 8% polyethylene glycol 4000, 84 mM NaCl, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide). They were then cultured for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Reactions were started by the addition of the test agents. After incubation for the indicated times, cellular extracts were prepared by four cycles of freezing and thawing. The CAT assay was performed as described previously(20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.60-16.66Google Scholar). Cellular extracts containing equal amounts of protein were treated at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate deacetylase, and then incubated for 4 h at 37°C with [14C]1-deoxychloramphenicol (50 nCi) and 0.1 mg/ml acetyl-CoA. The reaction mixtures were extracted with ethyl acetate, and then separated on a silica TLC plate (F1500, Schleicher & Schnell). After development of the TLC plate, the radioactivity was quantitated with a Fuji BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Co., Tokyo). CAT activity was normalized as to β-galactosidase activity due to co-transfected Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase, which was assayed as described previously(20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.60-16.66Google Scholar). A complementary pair of DNA fragments encoding region, −690 to −660, was synthesized with an ABI 391 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., CA), and then annealed as a probe. The fragment was radiolabeled at the 5′ ends with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts were prepared by detergent lysis method of Block et al.(21Brock T.G. Paine III, R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts (2 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 1 ng of a 32P-labeled probe (10,000 cpm) for 30 min at 30°C in 25 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), containing 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on native 4% polyacrylamide gels at 4°C at 150 V for 2 h in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), containing 380 mM glycine and 2 mM EDTA. The gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper and then autoradiographed with x-ray film (Fuji RX). A complementary pair of DNA fragments (−690 to −660) point-mutated at the E-box motif were synthesized with an ABI 391 DNA synthesizer. The sequences were as follows: 690F, 5′-ATAGATGTGTCAGAGCCCCGGGTCCTGAC-3′; 660R, 5′-AAGTCAGGACCCGGGGCTCTGACACATCT-3′. The mutated sites are underlined. They were annealed as the competitor for the gel mobility shift assay. A mutated plasmid as to the E-box motif was constructed by Kunkel's method(22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), using RHO810 as a template and 690F as a mutated primer. The mutation in the plasmid was confirmed by sequence analysis. The 5′-end-labeled fragment from −690 to −660 was incubated with the nuclear extract under standard gel mobility shift assay condition. Following electrophoresis, the wet gel was irradiated for 20 min using a UV transilluminator (254 nm; 1780 microwatts/cm2) at a distance of 12 cm of the UV source. Radioactive bands corresponding to protein-DNA complexes, I and II, were separately eluted by electroelution using Electro-elutor (Bio-Rad Model 422), and the eluate was subjected to SDS-12.5% PAGE, followed by autoradiography. We examined the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 on the expression of the HO-1 gene in RBL-2H3 cells by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, after a 0.5-h lag time, Δ12-PGJ2 gradually increased the mRNA level of HO-1. This stimulation of expression of HO-1 mRNA preceded the Δ12-PGJ2-induced HO-1 protein synthesis and HO-1 activity(9Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Prostaglandins. 1992; 43: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Δ12-PGJ2 concentration dependence caused marked accumulation of the mRNA, the maximum being reached at 10 μM (Fig. 1B), and this concentration dependence was consistent with those of Δ12-PGJ2-induced HO-1 protein synthesis and HO-1 activity(9Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Prostaglandins. 1992; 43: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mRNA level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase did not change. To identify the cis-regulatory element for Δ12-PGJ2-induced expression of the HO-1 gene, we isolated the 5′-flanking region of the HO-1 gene by PCR amplification, which included the 810 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site, containing two known cis-acting elements, the heat shock element (HSE) and the metal-responsive element (MRE). To determine whether or not Δ12-PGJ2 stimulates the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region, we examined the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 on the transient expression of the bacterial CAT reporter gene harboring the 5′-flanking region (−810 to +101) in RBL-2H3 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, RHO810 containing the 5′-flanking region gave low but detectable CAT activity, and Δ12-PGJ2 markedly stimulated it by about 5-fold, indicating that the region contains an element responsible for Δ12-PGJ2. Fig. 3 shows the time course and concentration dependence of the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 on the promoter activity of RHO810. Δ12-PGJ2 stimulated the promoter activity in a time-dependent manner, the time course being consistent with those of the Δ12-PGJ2-induced HO-1 protein synthesis and HO-1 activity(9Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Prostaglandins. 1992; 43: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Δ12-PGJ2 concentration-dependently stimulated it, the maximum being reached at 10 μM (Fig. 3B). This concentration dependence was consistent with that of the mRNA induction by Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig. 1B). We next examined the specificity of stimulation of the promoter activity for various PGs. As shown in Fig. 4A, Δ12-PGJ2 and Δ7-PGA1 markedly stimulated the activity, but the other PGs did not significantly stimulate it. HO-1 synthesis is known to be induced by other stimuli, such as heat shock, thiol-reactive agents, arsenite and diethylmaleate, and hemin, which is the substrate of heme oxygenase and a known strong inducer of HO-1 (23Ishizawa S. Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4220-4225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Taketani S. Sato H. Yoshinaga T. Tokunaga R. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biochem.

Thus, we examined the effects of these agents on the promoter activity of RHO810. As shown in Fig. 4B, heat shock strongly stimulated the promoter activity, while hemin did not stimulate it at all. Arsenite and diethylmaleate only slightly stimulated it.Figure 3:Time course and concentration dependence of the Δ12-PGJ2-stimulated promoter activity of RHO810. After cells (4 × 106 cells) had been transiently transfected with RHO810, they were treated with 10 μM Δ12-PGJ2 for the indicated times (A), or with the indicated concentrations of Δ12-PGJ2 for 9 h (B). The CAT assay was performed for cellular extracts, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are expressed as fold of the untreated cell value, and are the means for three independent experiments, which varied by less than 10%.

Taguchi H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, Δ12-PGJ2 was shown to activate a heat shock factor (HSF), which binds to HSE upstream of the HSP gene promoter, and to induce the transcription of HSP(26Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2457-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To identify the element responsible for the Δ12-PGJ2-stimulated promoter activity, we constructed a series of deletion plasmids as to the 5′-flanking region fused to the CAT gene, and then examined the effects of Δ12-PGJ2 on the promoter activity of the mutant genes. As shown in Fig. 5, RHO600, containing MRE and HSE, or RHO320, containing only HSE, had completely lost the Δ12-PGJ2 responsiveness, indicating that HSE or MRE is not the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element. RHO270, without either HSE or MRE, showed basal promoter activity without Δ12-PGJ2 responsiveness, but RHO-0, without the 5′-flanking region, lost basal promoter activity, indicating that the region from −270 to 0 is required for the basal promoter activity of HO-1 gene. Whereas the region (−810 to −600) itself did not show the basal promoter activity, this region (−810 to −600) combined with the region (−270 to +101) regained the Δ12-PGJ2-stimulated promoter activity, suggesting that this region contains an enhancer-like element. These results indicate that Δ12-PGJ2 stimulates the expression of the HO-1 gene through neither HSE nor MRE, but through an element located between −810 and −600. On the other hand, heat shock stimulated the promoter activity of either RHO600 or RHO320, but failed to stimulate the activity of the HSE-deleted mutant gene, RHO270 (data not shown). To examine whether the region from −810 to −600 has an enhancer function, we constructed another fusion gene with a heterologous promoter, SV40 promoter (Fig. 6). Δ12-PGJ2 stimulated the CAT activity by about 6-fold in the cells transfected with pCAT-HOs or pCAT-HOa containing the region from −810 to −600 in the sense or antisense orientation upstream from the SV40 promoter. This establishes that the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element has an enhancer function. To identify more precisely the region responsible for the stimulation by Δ12-PGJ2 and to detect nuclear protein binding to the region, we performed a gel mobility shift assay using various sized DNA fragments, from −810 to −600. We could not find potential binding sites for so far known transcription factors in the region from −810 to −600, but this region contained the consensus E-box motif, CANNTG (−673 to −668), for a large family of putative transcription factors, containing a basic helix-loop-helix domain(28Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Fig. 7A shows the result of protein-DNA complex formation using a DNA fragment of the region from −690 to −660, containing the E-box motif. Δ12-PGJ2 markedly induced two nuclear protein-DNA complexes with different mobilities (I and II). These complexes were displaced by double-stranded DNA fragments of −690 to −660, but not by either the single-stranded fragments or the E-box motif-mutated fragment, indicating that the nuclear proteins specifically recognize the E-box motif in this region. DNA fragments other than the region (−690 to −660) did not form complexes with nuclear proteins in response to Δ12-PGJ2 (data not shown). To identify the nuclear proteins, which bind to the region from −690 to −660, the complexes of nuclear proteins and the −690 to −660 DNA fragment were photolabeled by UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7B, subsequent SDS-12.5% PAGE analysis of the photolabeled complexes showed radioactive bands with different molecular weight, 80,000 and 24,000, as DNA complex form, respectively. We further examined the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 on the promoter activity of RHO810 point-mutated at the E-box motif. As shown in Fig. 7C, this point mutation completely abolished the Δ12-PGJ2-induced stimulation of the promoter activity of RHO810. These results indicate that the region (−690 to −660) contains the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element and that the E-box motif in this element is essential for this stimulation of the promoter activity. We demonstrated here that Δ12-PGJ2 drastically induced HO-1 mRNA through a Δ12-PGJ2-specific cis-regulatory element, containing a E-box motif, in RBL-2H3 cells. Δ12-PGJ2 induces the syntheses of a variety of proteins(3Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Among the Δ12-PGJ2-induced protein syntheses, the mechanism for the synthesis of HSP has been well characterized. A wide range of external stress stimuli, including heat shock, heavy metals, amino acid analogues, and oxidizing agents, drastically induce the expression of the HSP gene through activation of HSF, which binds to HSE located in the 5′-flanking sequence of the HSP gene(29Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Δ12-PGJ2 induces the expression of the HSP gene, and this induction is also mediated by HSF activation, as well as the above mentioned stimuli(26Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2457-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We here showed that Δ12-PGJ2 stimulated the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the HO-1 gene and then induced HO-1 mRNA in RBL-2H3 cells (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Although the 5′-flanking region contains HSE, HSE is not necessary for the Δ12-PGJ2-stimulated promoter activity (Fig. 5), but this stimulation requires the specific region (−690 to −660) containing the E-box motif (Fig. 7), indicating that Δ12-PGJ2 induces the gene expression through a specific element other than HSE. On the other hand, heat shock stimulated the promoter activity of RHO810, but this stimulation was completely abolished on removal of HSE, indicating that heat shock induces this gene expression through HSE. Furthermore, other stimuli, such as hemin and arsenite, did not stimulate the promoter activity of RHO810 or showed only very low stimulation (Fig. 4B). These findings demonstrate that this element specifically responds to Δ12-PGJ2 activation. Thus, the element could be referred to as the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element, and this is the first example of a cis-regulatory element showing a Δ12-PGJ2-specific response. Among various PGs, the stimulation of the promoter activity of HO-1 is specific for Δ12-PGJ2 and Δ7-PGA1 (Fig. 4A). The stimulation was not observed with A type cyclopentenone PGs as well as conventional PGs. Generally, the biological actions of PGA1 and PGA2 are much weaker than those of Δ12-PGJ2 and Δ7-PGA1(3Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A characteristic of cyclopentenone PGs, such as Δ12-PGJ2 and PGA2, is that they contain α,β-unsaturated ketones, which are very susceptible to nucleophilic addition reactions with thiols, and are essential for the actions of the PGs(30Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts Jr., L.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Atsmon J. Freeman M.L. Meredith M.J. Sweetman B.J. Roberts Jr., L.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1879-1885PubMed Google Scholar). PGA1 or PGA2 forms a monoconjugate with a thiol (32Cagen L.M. Fales H.M. Pisano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6550-6554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Parker J. Ankel H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but Δ12-PGJ2 or Δ7-PGA1 can form a bisconjugate with two thiols(30Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts Jr., L.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of PGA1 to synthetic polymer-supported thiols as the model of thiol-containing proteins is reversible, but that of Δ12-PGJ2 or Δ7-PGA1 is irreversible(34Noyori R. Suzuki M. Science. 1993; 259: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An irreversible bisconjugate with thiol groups of proteins may be required for the stimulation of the HO-1 promoter activity, or the stimulation by PGA1 or PGA2 might be marginal in the detection of the stimulation of the activity of CAT. The 5′-flanking region of the HO-1 gene contains a number of DNA sequences of potential regulatory elements. The 5′-flanking region of the rat HO-1 gene up to position −600 contains several potential binding sites for different transcription factors: a transcription factor, Sp1, a positive regulator for the control of amino acid synthesis (GCN4), a heat shock transcription factor, and a metal-dependent transcription factor(18Müller R.M. Taguchi H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal promoter region within 149 base pairs of the upstream sequence of the mouse HO-1 gene contains several sequence elements for AP-1, AP-4, C/EBP, and c-Myc:Max/USF, and is required for basal promoter activity (35Alam J. Cai J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several NFκB and AP-2-like binding sites have been found in the 5′-flanking region of the human HO-1 gene up to position −500(36Lavrovsky Y. Schwartzman M.L. Abraham N.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the more upstream region of rat HO-1 (−810 to −600), containing the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element, has not yet been reported to contain potential binding sites for so far known transcription factors. Thus, the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element is a novel cis-regulatory element and plays an important role in HO-1 gene expression. Recently, the heme oxygenase transcription factor, an essential transcription factor, was shown to interact with the cis-acting element (−51 to −35), located just upstream of the TATA box of the rat HO-1 gene, and this binding is essential for the basal expression of the HO-1 gene in rat glioma cells(37Sato M. Fukushi Y. Ishizawa S. Okinaga S. Müller R.M. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10251-10260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In RBL-2H3 cells, the proximal 5′-flanking region (−270 to +101) containing the heme oxygenase transcription factor binding element and TATA box showed the basal promoter activity. The proximal promoter region, containing the heme oxygenase transcription factor binding element and TATA box, is essential for the basal promoter activity. Whereas the region (−810 to −600) containing the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element itself did not show the basal promoter activity, this region (−810 to −600), when combined with the proximal 5′-flanking region (−270 to +101), enhanced the promoter activity of the region (−270 to +101) in a Δ12-PGJ2-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Furthermore, this region (−810 to −600) enhanced activity of the exogenous promoter, SV40 promoter (Fig. 6). The Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element thus appears to act as an enhancer. HO-1 mRNA was increased more than 30-fold by Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig. 1), although the magnitude of stimulation of CAT activity was 5-fold (Fig. 3). Such a difference may simply represent that the fusion genes lack the additional element required for the maximal stimulation by Δ12-PGJ2. Alternatively, this may be due to a limitation of transient expression assays; namely, integration of the fusion genes into the genomic DNA is required for the maximal stimulation. Using UV cross-linking, we identified two nuclear proteins, the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive factors, which specifically bind to the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element, their apparent molecular weight being 80,000 and 24,000 as DNA complex form, indicating that two different proteins bind to the element in response to Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig. 7B). The Δ12-PGJ2-responsive element contains an E-box motif, and this motif is essential for the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive factor binding to this element and for the Δ12-PGJ2-stimulated promoter activity (Fig. 7, A and C). The transcription factors which bind to the E-box motif contain a helix-loop-helix domain and an adjacent basic amino acid region, and a variety of transcription factors, such as MyoD, c-myc, and Myf-5, belong to this family(38Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). In RBL-2H3 cells, the Δ12-PGJ2-responsive factors appear to belong to a family of basic helix-loop-helix type transcription factors. Mast cells synthesize and subsequently release PGD2, which is converted into Δ12-PGJ2 by serum albumin during the process of inflammation(39Ito S. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1989; 37: 219-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The Δ12-PGJ2 produced stimulates the transcription of the HO-1 gene in various cells, such as basophils, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells, which are actively involved in the inflammatory response, and the reticuloendothelial system is the site at which the active degradation of heme by HO-1 may take place during inflammation. The induction of HO-1 by Δ12-PGJ2 may play an important role in the fate of heme liberated during inflammation. In summary, we here identified the Δ12-PGJ2-specific cis-regulatory element responsible for the expression of the rat HO-1 gene. This study will contribute not only to understanding of the HO-1 gene expression mechanism but will also facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of cyclopentenone PG actions We thank Dr. M. Suzuki of Gifu University for supplying Δ7-PGA1, and Drs. Y. Sugimoto and S.

Previous reports have characterized properties of a growth inhibitory activity (to bladder and prostatic epithelial cells), secreted by U4F fetal rat urogenital sinus mesenchymal cells, not cross-reactive with antibodies to known cytokines, and provisionally termed UGIF. The present study reports the characterization, purification, and biological properties of a 20-21-kDa protein responsible for UGIF activity. The 20-21-kDa protein (termed ps20) was purified to near homogeneity, the amino-terminal sequence was determined, and biological properties were characterized in vitro. Amino-terminal sequence analysis indicated no direct matches or regions of homology with known proteins. Purified ps20 induced a linear and saturable inhibition of thymidine incorporation in PC-3 prostatic carcinoma cells (half-maximal activity at 2.6 nM), inhibited cell proliferation (increased population doubling time from 19.8 to 25.8 h), and induced a 210% stimulation in the synthesis of secreted proteins. These data suggest that ps20 may be a candidate paracrine effector protein and may play a role in stromal-epithelial cell interactions in the prostate gland.

INTRODUCTIONThe induction of epithelial cell growth and differentiation patterns by adjacent mesenchymal cells is a common feature in the organogenesis of many tissues. Such interactions occur in reproductive tissues including seminal vesicle development(1Higgins S.J. Young P. Brody J.R. Cunha G.R. Development. 1989; 106: 219-234PubMed Google Scholar, 2Higgins S.J. Young P. Cunha G.R. Development. 1989; 106: 235-250PubMed Google Scholar), in the androgen-induced regression of male mammary gland(3Drews U. Cell. 1977; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and in estrogen-induced proliferation of mammary gland epithelial(4McGrath C.M. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1355-1360PubMed Google Scholar), vaginal epithelial, and uterine epithelial cells(5Cooke P.S. Uchima F.-D.A. Fujii D.K. Bern H.A. Cunha G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2109-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Stromal-epithelial interactions have been particularly well studied in the morphogenesis of fetal urogenital sinus (UGS) 1The abbreviations used are: UGSurogenital sinusUGIFurogenital sinus-derived growth inhibitory factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideps2020-kDa prostate stromal protein. to mature prostate gland(6Cunha G.R.

Androl. 1992; 13: 465-475PubMed Google Scholar). UGS epithelial cells progress through a specific morphogenesis pattern (prostatic glandular acini) only when recombined with UGS mesenchymal cells(8Cunha G.R. Anat. Rec. 1972; 172: 179-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Cunha G.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1976; 47: 137-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10Cunha G.R. Chung L.W.K. Shannon J.M. Reese B.A. Biol. Reprod. 1980; 22: 19-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Similar studies addressing the development of differentiated epithelium in skin(11Jahoda C.A.B. Horne K.A. Oliver R.F. Nature. 1984; 311: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), gut(12Lacroix B. Kedinger M. Simon-Assmann P. Haffen K. Biol. Cell. 1985; 54: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and lung (13Smith B.T. Sabry K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1951-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown a likewise potent inductive nature of stromal cells in directing tissue-specific epithelial growth and differentiation patterns.In postnatal and fully differentiated adult tissues, stromal-epithelial interactions likely maintain histological architecture and differentiated phenotype relative to ongoing modeling and remodeling processes(6Cunha G.R. Bigsby R.M. Cooke P.S. Sugimura Y. Cell Differ. 1985; 17: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Fully differentiated adult epithelial cells are capable of responding to a heterotypical (different) stroma. In this regard, adult bladder transitional epithelium can be induced by urogenital sinus mesenchyme to change to a prostate-specific epithelial cell phenotype including the expression of prostate-specific proteins, including androgen receptor(14Cunha G.R. Fujii H. Neubauer B.L. Shannon J.M. Sawyer L. Reese B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15Neubauer B.L. Chung L.W.K. McCormick K.A. Taguchi O. Thompson T.C. Cunha G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, abnormal patterns of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation in neoplastic disease progression are also affected by the origin and type of adjacent stroma. The growth of prostatic Dunning tumor adenocarcinoma was inhibited by 7-fold, and the morphology was altered to a more normal phenotype when recombined with UGS mesenchyme and grown in vivo(16Hayashi N. Cunha G.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4924-4930PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the recombination of normal UGS mesenchyme with bladder transitional cell carcinoma resulted in a change of tumor histopathology to an adenocarcinoma phenotype(17Fujii H. Cunha G.R. Norman J.T. J. Urol. 1982; 128: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, the implantation of UGS mesenchyme directly into the adult mouse prostate gland resulted in an induced hyperplastic phenotype typical of benign prostatic hyperplasia(18Chung L.W.K. Auble K. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These studies together support the suggestion that stromal-epithelial interactions are likely to be central in modulating the progression and histopathology of epithelial cells in proliferation- and differentiation-related diseases such as cancer and benign hyperplasia(19Chung L.W.K. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar).Although stromal cell induction of epithelium is critical for organogenesis and growth control in adult tissues, little is understood regarding paracrine effector molecules, fundamental molecular mechanisms of stromal-epithelial interactions, and the basic biology of UGS mesenchymal cells. Indeed, there is currently no well defined set of parameters or markers to clearly identify the stages of mesenchymal cell differentiation to adult stromal cells (fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, or smooth muscle), or the specific roles of these cell types in continued stromal-epithelial interactions. To identify putative mediators and markers of UGS mesenchymal cell action, we have reported previously the development of organ cultures and mesenchymal cell lines from fetal rat urogential sinus(20Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Rowley D.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 471-478Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Urogential sinus mesenchymal cell lines (U4F and U4F1) were adapted into chemically defined medium and characterized for stromal marker proteins(21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Rowley D.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 471-478Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Initial studies identified in U4F cell-conditioned medium, a growth inhibitory activity to PC-3 prostatic carcinoma epithelial cells, NBT-II bladder epithelial cells, and Mv-Lu-1 mink lung epithelial cells in vitro(20Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This activity did not cross-react with a battery of neutralizing antibodies to cytokines (including transforming growth factor-βs, interferons, and interleukins) and was provisionally termed urogenital sinus-derived growth inhibitory factor (UGIF) pending identification of biologically active components(21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Crude UGIF activity acted to inhibit epithelial cell proliferation in a linear and saturable manner, stimulate synthesis of secretory proteins, and alter epithelial phenotypic morphology in vitro, and it was nontoxic/reversible in mechanisms of action(20Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography analyses of crude UGIF activity showed a consistent elution pattern (peak of activity) assigned to the 18-22-kDa calculated size range(21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on additional physicochemical, biological, and immunological properties, UGIF activity could not be ascribed to a previously identified protein or factor(20Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The present study was conducted to characterize, identify, and purify the protein(s) primarily responsible for the previously described UGIF activity and characterize biological activity in vitro.We report here the identification and purification of a 20-21-kDa protein secreted from U4F mesenchymal cells in chemically defined conditioned medium, having biological properties identical to the previously characterized UGIF activity. Based on the cell type of origin and the biological activity in vitro, this protein may be relevant to growth and differentiation mechanisms of stromal-epithelial interactions and may serve as a useful marker for the study of mesenchymal cell ontogeny.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following materials were purchased: DMEM, Ham's F-12 medium, Hanks' solution, penicillin, and streptomycin from Life Technologies, Inc.; Nu-Serum and epidermal growth factor from Collaborative Research (Lexington, MA); fetal bovine serum from HyClone (Logan UT); MCDB-110 basal medium, insulin, trypsin type II, crystal violet dye, trypan blue dye, testosterone, and sodium lauryl sulfate from Sigma; methanol, trichloroacetic acid, EDTA, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium sulfate from Fisher; glacial acetic acid from Chempure (Curtin Matheson, Houston, TX); [methyl-3H]thymidine and [35S]methionine from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA); aqueous counting scintillant (BCS, no.

Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar), was cultured in medium Bfs (90% DMEM, 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% Nu-Serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml testosterone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), which was replaced every 48 h as previously reported(21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Upon confluence, U4F cultures typically formed multicellular spheroids (multicellular, spherical domes) after 20-30 days in culture, with UGIF activity first detectable in conditioned medium from spheroid-containing cultures(21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To generate sufficient quantities of conditioned medium for analysis of UGIF activity, 75-cm2 culture flasks were seeded with U4F cells yielding 100-200 spheroids per flask by 30 days in culture. U4F spheroid cultures were maintained for approximately 3-6 months in this manner with conditioned media collected every 48 h, pooled, quick frozen, and used as starting material for analysis of UGIF activity. For preparative purification of UGIF protein(s), spheroid cultures were switched to serum-free, chemically defined medium M2 (MCDB-110 basal medium plus 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 0.1 μg/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.5 μg/ml testosterone), formulated empirically to support U4F proliferation and secretion of UGIF activity as reported elsewhere(21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected every 48 h, clarified by centrifugation, and either used immediately, or stored at −20°C until subsequent use.The PC-3 cell line (ATCC CRL 1435, prostatic carcinoma epithelial) and Mv-Lu-1 cell line (ATCC CCL 64, mink lung epithelial) were received from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). PC-3 cells were cultured in 93% DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum, and Mv-Lu-1 cells in 90% DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, with each containing penicillin (25 units/ml) and streptomycin (25 μg/ml). Medium was replaced every 2-3 days. Cultures were passaged at confluence by brief exposure to trypsin-EDTA (0.25% trypsin, 0.025% EDTA in calcium, magnesium-free Hanks' salt solution). Cell viability was established by trypan blue dye exclusion and cells counted with an improved Neubauer type hemocytometer. All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination (MycoTect Kit, Life Technologies, Inc.).Cell Proliferation AssaysCell proliferation was determined by direct cell counting of viable cells and with a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay following minor modifications of procedures we reported previously(20Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Rowley D.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 471-478Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Rowley D.R. Dang T.D. McBride L. Gerdes M.J. Lu B. Larsen M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 781-786PubMed Google Scholar). For the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, PC-3 or Mv-Lu-1 target epithelial cells were seeded at 8.1 × 103 cells/148 μl/well in 96-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. Wells received a 52-μl aliquot of sample to be tested (previously vacuum dried and resolubilized in growth medium in sterile conditions) (200 μl/well final total volume) and were allowed to incubate for an additional 24 h. Cultures were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml) during the final 3 h. of incubation. The assay was terminated by fixing cell monolayers in situ with methanol:acetic acid (3:1) (200 μl/well) for 10 min (22°C), washing with 100% methanol (5 min, 22°C) followed by a wash with 5% trichloroacetic acid (5 min, 22°C), and a three times sequential wash with methanol (22°C, 200 μl/well). Plates were then allowed to air dry for 5-10 min under a heat lamp. Plates could either be stored indefinitely at 22°C or processed immediately. For processing, monolayers were hydrolyzed by 1 N NaOH (200 μl/well, 5 min, 22°C), and aliquots (180 μl) were added to scintillation vials containing 180 μl of 1 N HCl to neutralize pH. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Results are presented as the reciprocal of incorporated counts/min (1/cpm) where indicated in the figure legends, to reflect inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation as a peak of activity. Results from all comparative assays are presented as the mean of n ≥3 tests ± S.E. (error bars), and results were analyzed for significance using Student's t test.For direct cell counting, PC-3 cells were seeded at 4.0 × 103 cells/148 μl/well in 96-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. Wells received 52-μl aliquots of test sample and were allowed to incubate for 5 days. Cultures received fresh medium plus/minus test sample every 48 h. At each 24-h interval, cells were released by exposure to 0.25% trypsin, 0.025% EDTA in calcium, magnesium-free Hanks' solution (30 μl/well) for 4 min. To each well were added 70 μl of PC-3 cell growth medium plus 7% v/v fetal bovine serum, 40 μl of the cell suspension were incubated with trypan blue (4 min, 22°C), and total and viable cells were counted as described previously(20Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Synthesis AssayProtein synthesis was assayed by incorporation of [35S]methionine according to procedures published previously(20Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar). PC-3 cells were seeded and processed identically to the cell counting procedure. On day 2-4 of exposure to test samples, wells received [35S]methionine (10 μCi/ml) for 24 h. The medium (200 μl) was harvested and added to an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 2°C to precipitate proteins. Aliquots (350 μl) from each sample were added to glass fiber filters (934-AH, 2.4 cm, Whatman) fitted to a filter vacuum manifold (Millipore). Filters were washed sequentially three times with 2 ml of EtOH (−20°C) to remove unincorporated label, filters were added to scintillation vials, and incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Cell number was counted from each corresponding set of wells using the direct cell counting method, and results were expressed as disintegrations/min [35S]methionine incorporation/104 cells to standardize results to cell number.Ion Exchange ChromatographySamples were dialyzed (Spectrapore no. 3, Mr cutoff = 3,500) with 20 mM ammonium carbonate buffer (pH 8.85, 4°C) overnight, and applied directly to a DE-52 anion exchange column (1.5 × 9.5 cm, hydrostatic pressure = 30 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium carbonate (20-300 mM, pH 8.89, 150 ml) and 5 ml/fraction collected. Absorbance at 280 nm (A280) and conductivity were determined for each fraction. Aliquots (25 μl) of each fraction were directly vacuum-dried in sterile microcentrifuge tubes and resolubilized in sterile growth medium Bfs (65 μl), and 52-μl aliquots/well were assayed directly for PC-3 cell growth activity using the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay.Gel Filtration ChromatographyFor analytical studies to assign a protein species to the peak of biological activity, 50-200 ml of U4F conditioned medium Bfs (serum-containing) were dialyzed against 1 M acetic acid (pH 2.25) and lyophilized. Lyophilized proteins were resolubilized in 1 M acetic acid (1-3 ml) and chromatographed through a Bio-Gel P-200 or P-100 gel filtration column (2.5 × 70 cm), equilibrated in 1 M acetic acid, by gravity flow (45 cm), and 3-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots (100 μl) were vacuum-dried and resolubilized in 65 μl of Bfs growth medium, and 52-μl aliquots were added to PC-3 cells for [3H]thymidine incorporation assay.For additional analytical studies and for scaled-up preparative purification of ps20, samples derived from serum-free, chemically defined conditioned medium M2 were processed through the ion exchange chromatography step as described. Pooled fractions from the biologically active peak were prepared by dialysis (Spectrapore no. 3 tubing, 3,500 Mr cutoff) against 4 liters of 1 M acetic acid (pH 2.25) overnight at 4°C. Dialyzed samples were frozen and lyophilized and either used immediately or stored at −20°C until use. Lyophilized samples were solubilized in 1 M acetic acid (1 ml) and applied to either a Bio-Gel P-100 column or P-30 column (1.4 × 70 cm) equilibrated in 1 M acetic acid (pH 2.25). Proteins were eluted with a hydrostatic pressure of 55 cm, and 1.4-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots (100 μl) from each fraction were vacuum-dried in sterile microcentrifuge tubes and resolubilized in 65 μl of medium Bfs, and 52-μl aliquots were added to PC-3 cultures for [3H]thymidine incorporation assay.Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid ChromatographyAll samples for HPLC were first chromatographed through either ion exchange chromatography and/or gel filtration chromatography prior to HPLC analysis. Samples (pooled fractions from bioactivity peak) were either vacuum dried or lyophilized and solubilized in 50% formic acid (0.5 ml). Samples were applied (three consecutive 150-μl applications) to a Waters C-18 reverse phase column fitted to an HPLC system composed of a Waters 712 WISP automatic injector, and Beckman 412 controller, 110A pumps, and 165 variable wavelength detector. Proteins were eluted with a 1.0 ml/min/fraction flow rate with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a linear acetonitrile gradient as indicated in the text. Aliquots (100 μl) from each fraction were vacuum-dried, resolubilized in 65 μl of medium Bfs, and 52-μl aliquots added to either PC-3 cells or Mv-Lu-1 cultures for the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay.SDS-PAGE ElectrophoresisSamples were vacuum-dried, resolubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) following the procedures of Laemmli(24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar). Samples were heated (5-10 min, 95°C), 60-100-μl sample aliquots loaded per lane, and electrophoresed through the stacking gel at 40 mAmp and through the running gel (15% acrylamide) at 70-mAmp continuous current. Proteins were visualized using silver staining procedures as described previously(22Rowley D.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 471-478Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein determinations of highly purified samples below detectable range with Bradford analysis (<1 μg) were determined by comparative analysis of sample lanes with sets of protein standards 50-500 ng/lane in SDS-PAGE gels and an assignment was made based on relative staining density after silver staining. For renaturation of activity after SDS-PAGE, gels were washed in double-distilled water, protein standards position was determined by incubation in 1 M KCl at 4°C for visualization of opaque bands, and protein bands of interest were precisely excised in 1-2-mm slices. Excised proteins were renatured following minor modifications of the guanidine-HCl method (25Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) or were directly eluted from gels with 1 M acetic acid overnight (agitation, 22°C), vacuum-dried, and processed for biological assay as described.Protein SequencingSubstantially purified ps20 protein samples were electrophoresed through SDS-PAGE gels as described, except 100 mM thioglycolic acid was added to the cathode buffer, and gels were preelectrophoresed for 20 min at 50 V to reduce amino-terminal blockage. The gel was incubated in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-base, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.5) for 5 min and assembled with Immobilon-P or Pro-Blott PVDF membranes in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot cell apparatus according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proteins were electroblotted using 30 V for 18 h at 4°C. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining, the ps20 protein bands were excised, and the sequence was determined using Applied Biosystems 477A and 773A protein sequencers.RESULTSAssignment of UGIF Activity to a Protein SpeciesInitial studies were conducted to determine whether a putative protein species or set of proteins could be assigned to the peak or peaks of UGIF biological activity in order to assess feasibility of purification and focus on a particular protein for preparative purification. Accordingly, gel filtration chromatography and reverse phase HPLC were used to analyze UGIF activity, and eluted proteins were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. UGIF activity was harvested from U4F mesenchymal cell-conditioned medium following conditions reported previously(20Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). UGIF activity in conditioned medium was first detectable from confluent U4F cultures having small multicellular spheroids, which formed at approximately 25 days of culture, and activity continued to increase with the development of larger U4F cell spheroids as reported previously(21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Identical to previous reports, UGIF activity in CM collected from these long term cultures did not cross-react with neutralizing antibodies to a variety of cytokines including transforming growth factor-βs, interleukin-6, and interferons(21Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Ammonium sulfate precipitation of proteins from conditioned medium was used as a first step to concentrate samples. Approximately 90% of growth inhibitory activity precipitated within the 20-40% saturation range of ammonium sulfate (data not shown), which was then used for subsequent procedures. For analysis of UGIF bioactive proteins, all chromatography buffers were formulated to be both volatile (no salt residues upon vacuum drying) and bacteriostatic (sterile, nonsupportive of bacterial growth) so that aliquots from gel filtration or HPLC columns could be vacuum-dried in sterile vials and used directly for biological assay (addition to target epithelial cells in culture) without additional steps of dialysis and sterilization of sample. This strategy allowed for the biological assay of hundreds of fractions per day. For initial analysis of UGIF biological activity, precipitated proteins from conditioned Bfs medium (conditioned by U4F cells for 48 h) and unconditioned control Bfs medium were resolubilized in ammonium carbonate buffer. The initial chromatography step to analyze biological activity utilized ion exchange chromatography. Samples were dialyzed against 20 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 8.85), applied to and eluted from a DE-52 anion-exchange column according to the methods under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 1 shows the biological activity and A280 protein elution profiles. The elution of a major growth inhibitory peak was observed from the 48-h conditioned medium preparations. In comparison, the control (fresh medium) sample did not produce a growth inhibitory peak and exhibited an otherwise similar baseline activity and A280 elution pattern. These studies indicated the UGIF activity peak was produced by U4F cells and was not a constitutive component of fresh Bfs medium.Fractions from ion exchange representing the major peak of eluted biological activity (delineated by the bar underlining fractions in Fig. 1) were collected and pooled. The pooled sample was dialyzed against 1 M acetic acid (pH 2.5, 4 liters) overnight at 4°C. Dialyzed samples were quick frozen, lyophilized, and used either directly or stored at −20°C. UGIF activity prepared in this manner was further analyzed by gel filtration chromatography for assignment of size using a variety of buffer conditions including 1 M acetic acid, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium acetate. Of these conditions, gel filtration chromatography in 1 M acetic acid reduced the interaction with column matrix optimally and allowed for a reproducible recovery of an activity peak as shown in Fig. 2. Biological activity was detected as a single major peak, eluting consistently in the calculated 18-20-kDa size range (position of molecular mass markers is shown across the top of graph, Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE analysis of eluted fractions (Fig. 2, lower panel) showed the elution pattern of a 20-21-kDa protein to be directly correlated with the elution peak of biological activity (fraction 56,"
https://openalex.org/W2112549075,"Constituents of the Type 1 interferon (IFN) receptor (IFNABR) identified to date include the alpha and beta transmembrane subunits and the associated intracellular kinases, Jak 1 and Tyk 2. In this report, we demonstrate that a human cell type that expresses both subunits of IFNABR, together with Jak 1 and Tyk 2, exhibits a limited binding capacity for and is only partially sensitive to the effects of IFN-alpha/beta, despite adequate levels of the cytoplasmic transcription factors Stat1, Stat2, and Stat3. Specifically, a low affinity interaction between IFN-alpha/beta and cell surface receptors results in ISGF3 (Stat1:2) activation and an antiviral response, yet no IFN-inducible growth inhibition. Using a panel of murine cells that are variably configured with respect to the human IFNABR-alpha/beta subunits, we provide evidence that an additional component(s) encoded on human chromosome 21 is required to confer high affinity binding and IFN-inducible growth inhibition to cells that express the alpha and beta subunits of the IFNABR. The data indicate that transcriptional activation that leads to an antiviral response is mediated by IFN-alpha/beta activation of IFNABR-alpha and IFNABR-beta in the context of a low affinity interaction, yet a high affinity interaction is necessary for signal transducing events that mediate growth inhibition. We provide evidence that the extent of ISGF3 activation correlates directly with the magnitude of an antiviral but not a growth inhibitory response."

https://openalex.org/W2012569445,"The reaction of Factor XIII<sub>a</sub> with fibrin is the last enzyme-catalyzed step on the coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of a normal blood clot. The finding that fibrin is preferred by the cross-linking enzyme about 10-fold over the circulating fibrinogen suggests the operation of a unique substrate-level control for the orderly functioning of the physiological process in the forward direction. An important task is to elucidate the molecular mechanism for the transmission of the signal generated by the thrombin-catalyzed cleavage in the central E domain of fibrin to the distant Factor XIII<sub>a</sub>-reactive glutamine residues. By focusing on the substrate sites present in γ chain remnants of D type domains of fibrinogen and by employing the approach of fragment complementation with the regulatory E domain, which represents the thrombin-modified portion of fibrin, we have now succeeded in reconstructing in solution the phenomenon of kinetic enhancement for the reaction with Factor XIII<sub>a</sub>. Two D type preparations (truncated fibrinogen, ~250 kDa and D‘, ~105 kDa) were obtained by digestion of human fibrinogen with endo Lys-C. Neither product could be cross-linked by Factor XIII<sub>a</sub>, but as shown by the incorporation of dansylcadaverine, both were acceptor substrates for the enzyme. The plasmin-derived D (~105-kDa) product, however, could be cross-linked into DD dimers. In all cases, the admixture of E fragments exerted a remarkable boosting effect on the reactions with Factor XIII<sub>a</sub>. Even with native fibrinogen as substrate, cross-linking of γ chains was enhanced in the presence of E. Nondenaturing electrophoresis was used to demonstrate the complex forming potential of E fragments with fibrinogen, truncated fibrinogen, D‘, or D. The GPRP tetrapeptide mimic of the GPRV N-terminal sequence of the α chains in the E fragments, abolished both complex formation and the kinetic boosting effect of E on the reactions of substrates with Factor XIII<sub>a</sub>. Thus, the N-terminal α chain sequences seem to act as organizing templates for spatially orienting the D domains, probably during the protofibrillar assembly of the fibrin units, for favorable reaction with Factor XIII<sub>a</sub>."
https://openalex.org/W2123272610,"In order to examine metabolic zonation in human liver, glycerol, which labels carbons 2 and 5 of glucose-6-P, and [1-14C]lactate, which labels carbons 3 and 4 of glucose-6-P, in the process of gluconeogenesis, were infused intravenously into healthy subjects who ingested acetaminophen and had fasted 36 h. Distributions of 14C were determined in glucose in blood and in the glucuronic acid moiety of acetaminophen glucuronide excreted in urine. Ratios of 14C in carbons 2 and 5 to 14C in carbons 3 and 4 were significantly higher in blood glucose than in glucuronide. Since glucose and glucuronic acid are formed from glucose-6-P in liver without randomization of carbon, the differences in the ratios indicate that the pool of glucose-6-P in liver is not homogeneous. The glucuronide sampled glucose-6-P with more label from lactate than glycerol compared to the glucose-6-P sampled by the glucose. The apparent explanation is the greater decrease in glycerol compared with lactate concentration as blood streams from the periportal to the perivenous zones of the liver lobule. Glucuronidation is then expressed in humans relatively more in the perivenous than periportal zones and gluconeogenesis from glycerol more in the periportal than perivenous zones. In order to examine metabolic zonation in human liver, glycerol, which labels carbons 2 and 5 of glucose-6-P, and [1-14C]lactate, which labels carbons 3 and 4 of glucose-6-P, in the process of gluconeogenesis, were infused intravenously into healthy subjects who ingested acetaminophen and had fasted 36 h.

Glucuronidation is then expressed in humans relatively more in the perivenous than periportal zones and gluconeogenesis from glycerol more in the periportal than perivenous zones. Hepatocytes from the periportal and perivenous zones of livers of animals have been found by in vitro techniques to have differing metabolic capacities(1Jungermann K. Katz N. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 708-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 2Wals P.A. Palacin M. Katz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4876-4881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In gluconeogenesis, glucose-6-P formed from gluconeogenic substrates is hydrolyzed to glucose. In glucuronidation, glucuronic acid from UDP-glucuronic acid is conjugated. The UDP-glucuronic acid is formed from glucose-6-P with glucose-1-P and UDP-glucose as intermediates. Thus, both glucose and glucuronic acid are formed from glucose-6-P with carbon skeletons unchanged. In humans fasted for 12 h and 60 h, the concentration of glycerol, but not lactate, is much lower in hepatic vein than arterial blood(3Wahren J. Efendic S. Luft R. Hagenfeldt L. Bjorkman O. Felig P. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 59: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Bjorkman O. Felig P. Wahren J. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Bjorkman O. Felig P. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 516-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This means that during fasting periportal, as compared to perivenous, cells of human liver are exposed to relatively higher glycerol than lactate concentrations. Since a higher capacity for gluconeogenesis is reported to exist in periportal than perivenous cells of animals and for glucuronidation in perivenous than periportal cells(1Jungermann K. Katz N. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 708-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 2Wals P.A. Palacin M. Katz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4876-4881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that if carbon-labeled lactate and glycerol were administered to humans and metabolic zonation similarly exists in human liver in vivo, more label from the glycerol would be found in glucose than in a glucuronide relative to label from the lactate. We infused into fasted normal subjects, given acetaminophen, [2-14C]glycerol, which labels carbons 2 and 5 of glucose-6-P, and [1-14C]lactate, which labels carbons 3 and 4 of glucose-6-P (Fig. 1). The ratios of the 14C in carbons 2 and 5 to the 14C in carbons 3 and 4 of blood glucose were compared with the ratios in the acetaminophen glucuronide excreted in urine. The subjects were four healthy women volunteers, ages 26-44 years, on weight-maintaining diets, and with a mean body mass index (kg/m2) of 19.8 (range 19.4-20.1). The experimental protocol was approved by the Human Investigation Committees at the Karolinska Hospital and University Hospitals of Cleveland. Informed consent was obtained from each subject. The subjects fasted for 36 h. A catheter was then inserted into a peripheral vein of one arm for blood sampling and into a peripheral vein of the other arm for infusion. In the first subject we infused 10 μCi of [2-14C]glycerol, and in each of the other three subjects 25 μCi, in trace quantity (specific activity 40 mCi/mmol; purchased from ICN Biomedical Inc., Irvine, CA). In the first subject we also infused 60 μCi of [1-14C]lactate, and in each of the other three subjects 55 μCi (10 μCi as a bolus), again in trace quantity (specific activity 61 mCi/mmol; also purchased from ICN Biomedical Inc.). The labeled glycerol and lactate were in solution in sterile isotonic saline, shown to be pyrogen-free, and the infusion rate was constant at between 10 and 15 ml/h. Duration of infusion in the first two subjects was 5 h and in the other two subjects 8 h. The first two subjects ingested 0.5 g of acetaminophen at the beginning and at 1 and 2 h into the infusion, the other two subjects at 3, 4, and 5 h into the infusion. Blood samples, each 75 ml, were drawn between 3 and 5 h in the first two subjects and between 5 and 8 h in the other two subjects. Subjects were encouraged during the infusions to drink about 240 ml of water/h. Urine was collected from the first two subjects between 2-3.5 h and 3.5-5 h and in the other two between 5-6.5 h and 6.5-8 h. One ml blood samples were collected at the beginning and end of each infusion for determination of plasma glucose concentration. Glucose concentration in plasma was determined using glucose oxidase. Glucose was isolated from blood as described previously(6Landau B.R. Schumann W.C. Chandramouli V. Magnusson I. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E636-E647PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the blood at the time of collection was deproteinized by the addition of ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant frozen until it could be processed. It was deionized by passage through a column of ion exchange resins. Glucose in the effluent was isolated using preparative paper chromatography followed by high pressure liquid chromatography. The acetaminophen glucuronide was isolated, reduced to its glucoside, and glucose isolated from the glucoside as described previously(7Magnusson I. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4682-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Landau B.R. Fernandez C.A. Previs S.F. Ekberg K. Chandramouli V. Wahren J. Kalhan S.C. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E18-E26PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, urine at the time of collection was taken to pH 4.5 and frozen until processed further. The urine was concentrated, then brought to its original volume with methanol, and the precipitate that formed was discarded. The methanol was evaporated and the resulting concentrate made basic and applied to a column of AG1-X8 in the acetate form (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with water and then increasing concentrations of acetic acid. The fraction eluted containing the glucuronide, identified using carbazole(7Magnusson I. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4682-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was evaporated to dryness. The glucuronide was reduced with diborane to acetaminophen glucoside and the glucoside hydrolyzed with β-glucosidase. Glucose from the deionized hydrolysate was isolated as just described for glucose from blood. A portion of each glucose from blood and urine was combusted to CO2. The remainder of each glucose was degraded to yield each of its six carbons as CO2. Each CO2 was assayed for 14C specific activity(6Landau B.R. Schumann W.C. Chandramouli V. Magnusson I. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E636-E647PubMed Google Scholar, 7Magnusson I. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4682-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The specific activity of each carbon of glucose divided by the sum of the specific activities of the six carbons of glucose time 100 is recorded as the percentage of 14C in that carbon. The sum of the six specific activities divided by the specific activity of the glucose carbons, determined by the combustion of the glucose to CO2, × 100, is recorded as percentage of recovery. That provides a measure of the adequacy of the degradation. The significance of the differences in the ratios of incorporations of 14C in blood glucose to those in urinary glucuronide and other differences were assessed by a two-tailed paired t test(9Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. 7th Ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1980: 54-63Google Scholar). Plasma glucose concentrations at the beginning of the infusions ranged from 3.9 to 5.1 mM. Over the duration of the infusions concentrations declined by 0.5-0.7 mM. Amounts of 14C in glucoses isolated from some blood samples were small, and therefore degradations of those glucoses were not done. 14C was in greatest percentages in carbons 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Table 1) in accord with the pathways followed by the labeled carbons of the glycerol and lactate (Fig. 1). Recoveries were good. There was only about one-third as much 14C in carbons 2 and 5 as carbons 3 and 4 of glucose from the first subject, AD. This was the reason for giving 25 μCi rather than 10 μCi of [2-14C]glycerol to the other three subjects, since the lower the amount of 14C in a carbon, the more likely an error in the determination of the amount.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab 14C in carbon 2 was more than in carbon 5 (p < 0.001), and 14C in carbon 4 was more than in carbon 3 (p < 0.001). This result is in accord with glycerol's entrance into the triose-P pool via dihydroxylacetone-3-P and lactate's via glyceraldehyde-3-P and incomplete isotopic equilibration of the triose phosphates. Distributions in the glucose from blood and from glucuronide in the periods of collection were remarkably similar. The ratios of 14C in carbons 2 and 5 to 14C in carbons 3 and 4 were significantly different in blood glucose and in glucose from glucuronide (p < 0.005), being higher by an average of 30% (range from 26 to 37%). Incorporations into carbons 1 and 6 occur in the formation of glucose-6-P from [2-14C]lactate formed from the [2-14C]glycerol. Subtraction of the incorporations of 14C from the [2-14C]lactate into carbons 2 through 5 (10Magnusson I. Schumann W.C. Bartsch G.E. Chandramouli V. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6975-6984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hostetler K.Y. Williams H.R. Shreeve W.W. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2075-2077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) will give a still greater difference in the carbons 2 and 5 to carbons 3 and 4 ratios. The duration of infusion was increased from 5 to 8 h, with sampling during the last 3 h of infusion, to assure a steady state. However, just the very similar distributions at different times of blood and urine collections for each subject provide that assurance. Since glucose and glucuronic acid are both formed from glucose-6-P without randomization of carbon, the differences in the distributions, reflected in the differing C2 + C5/C3 + C4 ratios, mean there was not a homogeneous pool of glucose-6-P in liver. The glucuronide sampled glucose-6-P in hepatocytes where there was overall more label from lactate than glycerol, than was the case for the glucose-6-P the glucose sampled. The approach we introduce here for testing for metabolic heterogeneity in liver demonstrates differing metabolism in hepatocytes in humans in vivo. That conclusion rests on two assumptions. First, that the distribution of 14C in blood glucose reflects distribution in glucose-6-P in liver. Liver is the major source of blood glucose, but there is a report of a significant contribution of kidney to glucose production in dogs fasted overnight(12Cersosimo E. Judd R.L. Miles J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2584-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Second, that the distribution of 14C in the glucuronide reflects distribution in glucose-6-P in liver. Liver is the major site of glucuronidation, although glucuronidation can occur in other tissues (13Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980: 149-158Google Scholar). The present results are in accord with our previous finding that when [U-13C]glycerol and acetaminophen are given to fasted subjects isotopomer patterns are different in blood glucose and glucuronic acid from urinary acetaminophen glucuronide(8Landau B.R. Fernandez C.A. Previs S.F. Ekberg K. Chandramouli V. Wahren J. Kalhan S.C. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E18-E26PubMed Google Scholar). Neese et al. recently reported (14Neese R.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14452-14463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that rats infused with [2-13C]glycerol and acetaminophen, and fasted 24 h or infused with fructose, formed glucose and acetaminophen glucuronide from triose-P of the same enrichment. This seeming difference from our findings may be related to the difference in species, a quantity of glycerol rather than a trace amount being given to the rats, the conversion of glycerol to lactate, and the effect of the fructose load when that was also given. A different gradient in the concentrations of glycerol and lactate along the liver lobule (3Wahren J. Efendic S. Luft R. Hagenfeldt L. Bjorkman O. Felig P. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 59: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Bjorkman O. Felig P. Wahren J. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Bjorkman O. Felig P. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 516-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is an apparent major reason for the differing distributions we observe. Other factors, such as differences in the activity of glycerokinase along the liver lobule, could play a role. Hence, hepatocytes in the hepatic vein zone were presumably exposed to more label from the lactate than glycerol compared to hepatocytes in the periportal zone. The glucuronide compared to the glucose then sampled glucose-6-P to a greater extent in the hepatic venous than periportal zone. That conclusion is in accord with a higher capacity for glucuronidation found in rat liver in vitro in hepatic venous than periportal zones We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Dr. Paul K. Jones in the statistical analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1997872681,"In previous work we suggested that a kidney-specific transcription factor LFB3 cooperates with cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding proteins within a cAMP regulatory unit comprised of three protein-binding domains and located 3.4 kilobase pairs upstream of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene in LLC-PK1 cells (Menoud, P.-A., Matthies, R., Hofsteenge, J., and Nagamine, Y.(1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 1845-1852). The two domains contain a CRE-like sequence, and the third domain is recognized by LFB3. The absolute requirement of LFB3 as well as the cooperation among the three domains for cAMP regulation were confirmed by transient transfection assays in F9 teratocarcinoma cells, in which the level of LFB3 was negligible. Suspecting a possible feedback regulation of LFB3 mRNA expression during cAMP-dependent uPA gene induction in LLC-PK1 cells, we measured LFB3 mRNA levels after cAMP treatment and found a strong reduction. This reduction was not due to a change in template activity of the LFB3 gene because run-on transcription showed no significant change in LFB3 gene transcription. RNA synthesis inhibitor-chase experiments indicated that the down-regulation was post-transcriptional. Interestingly, when the inhibitor was added at the same time as cAMP, the cAMP-induced decrease in LFB3 mRNA levels was abrogated, suggesting that on-going RNA synthesis is required for the decrease. Similar effects on LFB3 mRNA metabolism were observed with all agents that induce uPA mRNA in LLC-PK1 cells, including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, okadaic acid, colchicine, and cytochalasin. We discuss the significance of this regulation in uPA gene expression. In previous work we suggested that a kidney-specific transcription factor LFB3 cooperates with cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding proteins within a cAMP regulatory unit comprised of three protein-binding domains and located 3.4 kilobase pairs upstream of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene in LLC-PK1 cells (Menoud, P.-A., Matthies, R., Hofsteenge, J., and Nagamine, Y.(1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 1845-1852). The two domains contain a CRE-like sequence, and the third domain is recognized by LFB3. The absolute requirement of LFB3 as well as the cooperation among the three domains for cAMP regulation were confirmed by transient transfection assays in F9 teratocarcinoma cells, in which the level of LFB3 was negligible. Suspecting a possible feedback regulation of LFB3 mRNA expression during cAMP-dependent uPA gene induction in LLC-PK1 cells, we measured LFB3 mRNA levels after cAMP treatment and found a strong reduction. This reduction was not due to a change in template activity of the LFB3 gene because run-on transcription showed no significant change in LFB3 gene transcription.

We discuss the significance of this regulation in uPA gene expression. Signal transduction, a process of successive activation of various molecules, is subject to various levels of regulation. In many cases, for the sake of homeostasis, activated molecules are sequestered from the pathway by desensitization of membrane-bound receptors(1Soderquist A.M. Carpenter G. J. Membr.

Cross-talk between different signaling pathways is also an important mechanism for bestowing flexible and versatile regulation on a given pathway. This can be either positive or negative and occurs at various steps in the pathway in a cell-specific manner (for reviews, see (8Delmas V. Molina C.A. Lalli E. de Groot R. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D.

Therefore, in addition to the identification of successively activated components of a signaling pathway and the elucidation of the mechanism of activation of each component, it is also very important to know how the activity of each component is modulated by molecules not immediately upstream in the pathway. In this way, the nature of a signaling pathway may be understood in a more physiologically relevant context. We have been studying urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateCREcAMP response elementDRB5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazoleBr-cAMP8-bromo-cAMPUTRuntranslated regionkbkilobase pair(s). gene regulation in LLC-PK1 cells, a cell line derived from pig kidney epithelia(11Hull R.N.

In these cells, the uPA gene is induced through independent signaling pathways by various signals such as cAMP(12von der Ahe D. Pearson D. Nagamine Y.

Pearson D. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1991-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This enhancer is comprised of three protein-binding domains, A, B, and C. Domains A and B contain a core sequence of the cAMP response element (CRE) but require the adjoining C domain to confer full cAMP responsiveness on a heterologous promoter(12von der Ahe D. Pearson D. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1991-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The C domain has no CRE and cannot mediate cAMP responsiveness when used in isolation. We have purified the protein binding to the C domain (17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and found it to be the pig equivalent of mouse LFB3(18De Simone V. de Magistris L. Lazzaro D. Gerstner J. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It is also known as HNF1β (19Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) or vHNF1(20Rey-Campos J. Chouard T. Yaniv M. Cereghini S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). LFB3 is a tissue-specific transcription factor highly expressed in kidney cells (18De Simone V. de Magistris L. Lazzaro D. Gerstner J. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with a structure closely related to the liver-specific transcription factor HNF1α. Both HNF1α and LFB3 recognize the same DNA sequence, at least in vitro(17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Bach I. Mattei M.G. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 13: 3553-3559Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although the domain C sequence is quite different from the consensus HNF1α recognition sequence. It is still not known which genes besides the uPA gene are the targets of LFB3 in kidney cells, or how the expression of LFB3 is regulated. As LFB3 is apparently involved in cAMP-dependent uPA gene regulation in LLC-PK1 cells, we were interested to know whether cAMP-evoked signaling affected the expression of LFB3 in these cells. Indeed, we have shown that cAMP treatment strongly reduces LFB3 mRNA levels, suggesting a feedback mechanism via LFB3 in cAMP-dependent uPA gene regulation in LLC-PK1 cells(17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, we verify the involvement of LFB3 in cAMP-induction of the uPA gene and show that not only cAMP but also other agents that induce uPA gene expression strongly reduce the amount of LFB3 mRNA. These agents are 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, okadaic acid, colchicine, and cytochalasin B. Our results suggest the involvement of LFB3 in uPA gene regulation by cAMP at different levels. urokinase-type plasminogen activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate cAMP response element 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole 8-bromo-cAMP untranslated region kilobase pair(s). TPA, colchicine, and cytochalasin B were obtained from Sigma; 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) from Fluka; 8-bromo-cAMP (Br-cAMP) from Boehringer Mannheim; and okadaic acid from Anawa. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. The oligonucleotides used for electromobility shift assays were (only upper strands given): domain A, 5′-AATTCTGTGCCTGACGCACAG-3′; domain B, 5′-AATTCGCCCATGACGAACACTGGG-3′; domain C, 5′-GTGAATGAATAAAGGAATAAATGAATGATTTCACA-3′; mPEA3/AP1, 5′GATCCGTCCAAGGAATTCATGAGGTCATCCTG3′; and SP1, 5′-GATCCAGCCCTGGCCCCGCCCTAGCCTG-3′. The mPEA3/AP1 sequence is derived from the PEA3/AP1 site of the uPA gene, and its PEA3 site is mutated (17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The sequences of oligonucleotides used for the construction of templates are shown in Fig. 1a. LLC-PK1(11Hull R.N. Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and F9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10 and 5% (v/v), respectively, fetal calf serum (AMIMED), 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin at 37°C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. LLC-PK1 cells were plated on plastic dishes and F9 cells on gelatin-coated plastic dishes. In pTATA (constructed and provided by A. E. Sippel) the firefly luciferase gene is linked to a minimal promoter of the thymidine kinase gene (−46 to +52) containing only the TATA box and the transcription initiation site. Mutated and nonmutated sequences derived from the cAMP-responsive enhancer ABC site, which is located 3.4 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of the uPA gene, were inserted immediately 5′ of the TATA box of pTATA (Fig. 1a). Similar constructs with nonmutated sequences, but with the SV40 early gene promoter, and the pig LFB3 expression vector have been described previously(17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cDNA clones for pig uPA, pYN15 (22Nagamine Y. Pearson D. Altus M.S. Reich E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9525-9541Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), for pig actin, pACT4(23Ziegler A. Knesel J. Fabbro D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21067-21074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for pig LFB3 (17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have been described. The DNA insert from each plasmid was labeled with [α-32P]dATP using a random oligo-primed reaction(24Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 3 × 105 (LLC-PK1) or 2 × 105 (F9) per 35-mm plate the day before transfection. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate-mediated precipitation with 1-3 μg of DNA. When cells were to be induced, cells were treated 20 h after transfection with 1 mM Br-cAMP for 6 h. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity as described elsewhere (17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using a Lumiometer (Autolumat LB 953, Berthold). Total RNA was isolated according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar) and analyzed for levels of specific mRNAs by Northern blot hybridization as described(23Ziegler A. Knesel J. Fabbro D. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21067-21074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the loading and transfer of similar amounts of RNA, ribosomal RNA was visualized on nylon filters by staining with methylene blue(26Herrin D.L. Schmidt G.W. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 196-200PubMed Google Scholar). After hybridization, filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film with an intensifying screen at −70°C. Levels of specific RNA were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. RNA stability was measured by the RNA synthesis inhibitor-chase method as described(27Ziegler A. Hagmann J. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21194-21201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with DRB (20 μg/ml) to inhibit transcription, and total RNA was isolated at several subsequent time points. RNA was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. mRNA levels were plotted using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) and subjected to linear regression. The isolation of nuclei, nuclear run-on transcription, and quantitation of specific transcripts by hybridization were performed as described previously(28Andrus L. Altus M.S. Pearson D. Grattan M. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6183-6187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from LLC-PK1 cells and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously(13Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A cAMP-inducible enhancer located 3.4 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of the uPA gene is composed of three protein binding domains, A, B, and C; domain C lacks a CRE sequence and is necessary together with domains A and B for full cAMP-inducible activity(12von der Ahe D. Pearson D. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1991-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cooperation between domains A and B and domain C was reevaluated in the context of the minimum thymidine kinase gene promoter containing only a TATA box by transient transfection assays (Fig. 1b). To activate cAMP-dependent signaling, we used Br-cAMP or an expression vector of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. As shown in Fig. 1b, templates with domains A and B alone or domain C alone did not exhibit significant inducibility compared with the control template, while the template with all three domains (pABC-TATA) showed strong inducibility. This inducibility was strongly reduced when the template pABC-TATA was mutated in any of the three domains. The mutations were introduced to the sites that had been shown to interact with nuclear proteins by methylation interference experiments(12von der Ahe D. Pearson D. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1991-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The induction with Br-cAMP elicited a stronger response than with the catalytic subunit, which may be due to a high concentration of free regulatory subunits in LLC-PK1 cells. We previously cloned the domain C-binding protein and found it to be the pig equivalent of mouse LFB3(17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of LFB3 on the above templates by transient coexpression assays in F9 cells, which have a negligible level of endogenous LFB3. We used only the catalytic subunit to activate the signaling because endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase is not responsive to cAMP in F9 cells by an unknown mechanism(29Masson N. Ellis M. Goodbourn S. Lee K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 1c shows that in F9 cells pABC-TATA was strongly induced by the catalytic subunit only when LFB3 was coexpressed. The control pTATA was not affected. These results unambiguously indicate the cooperation among three protein-binding domains and the involvement of LFB3 in cAMP regulation through the ABC site. To confirm the previous observation that cAMP treatment reduces LFB3 mRNA in LLC-PK1 cells, we compared Br-cAMP to other agents shown to induce uPA mRNA in the same cells, TPA, colchicine, cytochalasin B, and okadaic acid. The cells were incubated for the time optimal for uPA mRNA induction, i.e. 2 h for Br-cAMP and TPA and 4 h for the rest. As shown in Fig. 2, Br-cAMP as well as other agents strongly reduced LFB3 mRNA levels; all of them induced uPA mRNA. The greatest reduction in LFB3 mRNA levels was obtained with TPA and okadaic acid (85% by 2 and 4 h) and the least with cytochalasin B (60% by 4 h). With the exception of Br-cAMP, all the other agents induce uPA gene via the activation of AP1, acting on the PEA3/AP1 site located 2 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site(13Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Lee J.S. Favre B. Hemmings B.A. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2887-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in the following experiments we compared in particular Br-cAMP and TPA. We tested whether the reduction of LFB3 mRNA levels after treatment with uPA inducers was reflected at the protein level. As specific antibodies against pig LFB3 were not available, we measured domain C binding activity in nuclear extracts. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using crude nuclear extracts prepared from LLC-PK1 cells pretreated for 7 h with Br-cAMP or TPA. Using a 32P-labeled domain C oligonucleotide as a probe, we observed a single distinct band (Fig. 3), which could be competed by excess of the identical unlabeled oligonucleotide but not by an oligonucleotide carrying the same mutations as shown in Fig. 1a (data not shown). After treatment of the cells with TPA, the binding activity was reduced to about 50%, with Br-cAMP to 40% and with TPA and Br-cAMP added together to about 30%. These data indicate that the LFB3 binding activity is reduced by Br-cAMP or TPA treatment, suggesting that the reduced mRNA level affects the protein level. To see whether the observed reduction is specific for domain C binding, we tested other oligonucleotides recognized by different transcription factors using the same nuclear extracts. Although domains A and B were required for cAMP induction, proteins binding to these sites were not affected by treatment of the cells with Br-cAMP or TPA. With the SP1 oligonucleotide, two major specific bands were detected, but they did not change in intensity after this treatment. In contrast, with the mPEA3/AP1 oligonucleotide, which binds transcription factor AP1(13Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the intensity of the shifted band markedly increased on treatment with TPA and even more with Br-cAMP. The mechanism leading to the reduction of LFB3 mRNA by uPA inducers may involve either transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of the LFB3 gene. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we first performed nuclear run-on transcription to assess changes in the LFB3 gene transcription rate. The results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the transcription rate of the LFB3 gene did not change when cells were treated with TPA, Br-cAMP, colchicine, or cytochalasin B. As expected, these agents significantly enhanced the uPA gene transcription rate. Thus, the decrease in LFB3 mRNA levels seems not to be due to decreased de novo synthesis of LFB3 mRNA, suggesting that the reduction of LFB3 mRNA is a post-transcriptional event. If a post-transcriptional step is responsible for the induced decrease in LFB3 mRNA level, the most obvious mechanism could be an effect on mRNA stability. The stability of LFB3 mRNA was assessed by DRB-chase experiments. Since DRB specifically inhibits the synthesis of eukaryotic heterogeneous nuclear RNA and mRNA(30Tamm I. Sehgal P.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1978; 22: 187-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), chase of mRNA levels after its addition allows estimation of the decay rate of the mRNA. Because inhibition of mRNA synthesis may have some indirect influence on mRNA stability(31Nanbu R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we did chase experiments using two different schemes: in one experiment DRB was added at the same time as Br-cAMP or TPA, and in the other DRB was added 1 h after Br-cAMP or TPA treatment. The effect on LFB3 mRNA was independent of the presence of Br-cAMP when DRB was added at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 5a). However, LFB3 mRNA decayed faster in the presence of Br-cAMP when DRB was added 1 h after Br-cAMP (Fig. 5b). Similar results were obtained using TPA (Fig. 5, c and d). These results indicate that the stability of LFB3 mRNA is reduced by uPA inducers, and that this requires on-going RNA synthesis for at least 1 h at the beginning of the treatment. TPA and cAMP treatment reduced the DNA binding activity of LFB3. To test the biological relevance of this decrease in cAMP induction we asked whether TPA pretreatment could affect the cAMP-induction of pABC-TATA. As shown in Fig. 6, TPA pretreatment by itself had little effect on basal expression but significantly reduced cAMP induction of the luciferase gene driven by ABC sites. LFB3 is an enhancer-binding protein augmenting basal expression of a gene that contains its cognate cis-element. We found in the induction of the uPA gene by cAMP in LLC-PK1 cells that LFB3 is a positive regulator cooperating with CRE-binding proteins within a composite cAMP-responsive enhancer (17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (this work). Our results also suggest that LFB3 is involved in a down-regulating phase of cAMP-induced uPA gene expression. We have previously shown that uPA gene induction by cAMP is transient; the rate of uPA gene transcription reaches optimal after 2-4 h of cAMP treatment but declines thereafter (32Degen J.L. Estensen R.D. Nagamine Y. Reich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12426-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may be that in uPA gene regulation LFB3 acts as a negative feedback regulator by decreasing its own concentration in response to cAMP. This throws new light on LFB3, which has been implicated as a factor coupling hormonal regulation and tissue-specific regulation of uPA gene expression in kidney epithelial cells(17Menoud P.-A. Matthies R. Hofsteenge J. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The decrease in domain C binding activity seems to be due to a decrease in LFB3 protein levels. The decrease was also observed with TPA, and it may also be the case for colchicine, cytochalasin B, and okadaic acid, which all decreased LFB3 mRNA levels (see below). These agents induce uPA gene expression in LLC-PK1 cells via activation of the transcription factor AP1, although the mechanism of AP1 activation by each agent is different(13Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Nagamine Y. Ziegler A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Lee J.S. Favre B. Hemmings B.A. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2887-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the features mentioned above, LFB3 may mediate negative cross-talk between cAMP-dependent signaling and AP1-activating signaling pathways in uPA gene regulation. Indeed, pretreatment with TPA significantly reduced cAMP induction of the luciferase gene driven by an enhancer consisting of domains A, B, and C. The decrease in DNA binding by LFB3 in the cells seems to be due to the reduction in the protein levels. We cannot formally exclude the possibility that the decrease is due to a post-translational modification of the protein; however, this is in any case not the main cause because we also detected a strong reduction in LFB3 mRNA levels. The possible role of LFB3 in cAMP-dependent uPA gene regulation through the ABC site revealed by this work is summarized in Fig. 7. The decrease in DNA-binding activity evoked by treatment with the uPA inducers in these cells was specific to the domain C binding protein, LFB3, and not a general effect, because DNA binding of the proteins recognizing domains A and B and of the ubiquitous transcription factor SP1 remained constant. Furthermore, the DNA-binding activity to the mutated PEA3/AP1-oligonucleotide, which contains an active AP1 site mediating the action of TPA, colchicine, cytochalasin and okadaic acid, was increased by Br-cAMP as well as by TPA. We have not elaborated the mechanism of the increase in PEA3/AP1-binding activity, i.e. whether it is transcriptional or post-transcriptional. It is worthwhile to mention that the peptide hormone calcitonin, which raises intracellular cAMP concentrations, strongly enhances de novo synthesis of c-Fos and c-Jun(13Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), raising the interesting possibility of a cross-regulation of the TPA-dependent signaling pathway by the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway at the transcription step. The cAMP signal by itself does not utilize the PEA3/AP1 site to increase uPA gene expression(13Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We do not know yet whether the enhancement of c-Fos together with c-Jun levels exerts positive effects on PEA3/AP1 site-mediated uPA gene expression, because the overexpression of c-Fos had no effect on uPA gene induction in NIH3T3 cells(33Besser D. Presta M. Nagamine Y. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in LFB3 mRNA levels is mainly attributable to induced mRNA instability. We did not detect changes in the LFB3 gene transcription rate, but we did observe that LFB3 mRNA degradation increased in the presence of TPA or Br-cAMP. Interestingly, however, enhanced instability was observed only when DRB was added 1 h after TPA or Br-cAMP treatment, suggesting that some RNA transcripts or their translation products are involved in LFB3 mRNA metabolism. It may be that TPA or Br-cAMP induces a factor, RNA or protein essential for LFB3 mRNA degradation, or that an RNA or a protein of short half-life is involved in LFB3 mRNA degradation, at least at an early stage. A requirement for on-going RNA synthesis in mRNA degradation has been reported for several mRNAs, such as those for c-fos,(34Shyu A.-B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), c-myc(35Wisdom R. Lee W. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), collagenase(36Delany A.M. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the transferrin receptor(37Heckel J.L. Sandgren E.P. Degen J.L. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 447-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have shown that an RNA instability-regulating site in the 3′-UTR of uPA mRNA requires on-going RNA synthesis for its activity (31Nanbu R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the importance of this site in overall uPA mRNA degradation may depend on cell type (38Stacey K.J. Nagamine Y. Hume D.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In none of these cases is it known how on-going RNA synthesis contributes to mRNA degradation. Several instability-determining sequences have been identified in many mRNAs. These include sequences located in the 3′-untranslated region, such as the iron-responsive element in the transferrin receptor mRNA(37Heckel J.L. Sandgren E.P. Degen J.L. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and AU-rich sequences in various oncogene and lymphokine mRNAs (40Caput D. Beutler B. Hortog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S.

But instability-determining elements have also been identified in coding regions, e.g. c-myc(35Wisdom R. Lee W. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and c-fos(45Shyu A.B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) mRNAs. We tested the 3′-UTR and protein-coding regions of LFB3 mRNA in a system developed for the study of uPA mRNA degradation by inserting these sequences in an otherwise stable globin mRNA(31Nanbu R. Menoud P.-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the stability of recombinant globin mRNAs was not affected by TPA or Br-cAMP. 2R. Marksitzer, A. Stief, P.-A. Menoud, and Y. Nagamine, unpublished data. It may be that regulatory sequences reside in 5′-UTR or the 3′ extreme which we have not tested or that the globin mRNA context interfered with TPA- and Br-cAMP-induced mRNA degradation. Whether the cAMP and TPA signals utilize the same mechanism to induce LFB3 mRNA destabilization is not yet established, although it is plausible considering that induced LFB3 mRNA instability by either agent requires ongoing RNA synthesis and that signal transductions induced by the two agents are related. In the cell, cAMP and TPA activate distinct signaling pathways but are otherwise quite related. Both agents trigger signaling by activating serine/threonine kinases, and the transcription factors that are eventually activated by these signals are also related; the cAMP and TPA signals activate CREB/ATF and AP1, respectively, which are highly related transcription factors containing basic/leucine zipper domains, recognize highly similar sequences, and can cross-dimerize (for reviews, see (8Delmas V. Molina C.A. Lalli E. de Groot R. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. Sassone Corsi P. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (46Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar)). A protein responsible for induced LFB3 mRNA degradation could be phosphorylated and regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase as well as by protein kinase C. Alternatively, the two different but related transcription factors may exert their effects at a post-transcriptional step by interacting with the same RNA sequence or RNA-binding protein. It should be remembered that colchicine, cytochalasin B, and okadaic acid also reduce LFB3 mRNA (Fig. 2) and that these agents do not require protein kinase C to activate AP1 and induce the uPA gene(13Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Lee J.S. Favre B. Hemmings B.A. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2887-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of regulatory sequences in LFB3 mRNA and the corresponding binding proteins should help answer these questions. We have shown that uPA inducers reduce LFB3 mRNA levels. Is there any physiological significance in this apparent linkage, or is this reverse regulation fortuitous, using very common signaling pathways? uPA is a secreted protease which plays an important role in various extracellular proteolytic processes (for reviews, see (47Dano K.

The triplet state lifetime shows that whereas nucleoside triphosphate binding to the enzyme in the presence of Mg2+ increases the flexibility of the protein structure surrounding the chromophore, nucleoside diphosphate acts in an opposite manner, enhancing the rigidity of this region of the macromolecule. Such changes in dynamic structure of the ε-subunit are evident at high ligand concentration added to both the nucleotide-depleted F1 (Nd-F1) and the F1 preparation containing the three tightly bound nucleotides (F1(2,1)). Since the effects observed are similar in both the F1 forms, the binding to the low affinity sites must be responsible for the conformational changes induced in the ε-subunit. This is partially supported by the observation that the Trp lifetime is not significantly affected by adding an equimolar concentration of adenine nucleotide to Nd-F1. The effects on protein structure of nucleotide binding to either catalytic or noncatalytic sites have been distinguished by studying the phosphorescence emission of the F1 complex prepared with the three noncatalytic sites filled and the three catalytic sites vacant (F1(3,0)). Phosphorescence lifetime measurements on this F1 form demonstrate that the binding of Mg-NTP to catalytic sites induces a slight enhancement of the rigidity of the ε-subunit. This implies that the binding to the vacant noncatalytic site of F1(2,1) must exert the opposite and larger effect of enhancing the flexibility of the protein structure observed in both Nd-F1 and F1(2,1). The observation that enhanced flexibility of the protein occurs upon addition of adenine nucleotides to F1(2,1) in the absence of Mg2+ provides direct support for this suggestion.

The ATPase (ATP synthase) is the enzyme responsible for ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation in all energy-transducing membranes. It is composed of two main parts: F0, capable of proton transport across the membrane and the catalytic part; F1, bound to F0 through a “stalk” segment (for reviews see (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys.

However, these enzymes are not identical mainly because of differences in two of the subunits; δ- and ε-subunits of bacteria (and chloroplasts) are homologous to oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein and δ of beef heart, respectively. Therefore, the ε-subunit of mitochondria lacks a counterpart in bacteria and chloroplasts. The two major subunits α and β of F1 contain at their interfaces a total of six nucleotide binding sites, which are characterized by different properties(7Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Methods are needed to selectively monitor conformational changes of specific domains or subunits of the unmodified protein. Trp phosphorescence measured at room temperature has shown considerable potential for the study of protein structure in solution(33Strambini G.B. J. Mol.

Gonnelli M. Chem. Phys.

We have recently used the phosphorescence of the sole tryptophan residue of the mitochondrial F1 complex as an internal probe of the ε-subunit(38Solaini G. Baracca A. Parenti-Castelli G. Strambini G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Baracca A. Barogi S. Gabellieri E. Lenaz G. Solaini G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and the lifetime (τ) measurements have revealed conformational changes of the nucleotide-depleted enzyme as a consequence of Mg-ATP binding at low temperature. The high complexity of nucleotide binding sites of F1 and the existence of temperature-dependent conformational states of the enzyme prompted us to further investigate on possible alterations in the dynamic structure of the ε-subunit induced by selective nucleotide-site occupancy. We have analyzed the phosphorescence decay kinetics of F1 at room temperature in the presence or absence of nucleoside di- and triphosphates associated with loose or tight, catalytic and noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites. These noninvasive studies of intrinsic phosphorescence provide evidence that the conformation of the ε-subunit in situ is affected differently by the binding of nucleoside di- or triphosphates to the various nucleotide binding sites of F1. ATP, ADP, GTP, GDP, phosphoenolpyruvate, Hepes, Tris, and NADH were obtained from Sigma as were pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in glycerol-containing buffers. Sephadex G-50, Sephacryl S-300, Blue Sepharose CL-6B, and standard marker proteins were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. F1 was prepared from bovine heart mitochondria according to Penefsky(40Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 55: 304-308Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have observed that at this stage the enzyme preparation contained minor contaminants: a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 48 kDa and the ATPase inhibitor protein. All of the contaminants were removed as follows. By affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose CL-6B, 16 mg of protein was loaded onto a column (4 cm × 1 cm, inner diameter) in 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP, and 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8(41Lutter R. Abrahams J.P. Van Raaij M.J. Todd R.J. Lundqvist T. Buchanan S.K. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), at a 4 ml/h flow rate. 13 mg of the non-retained protein were concentrated to 15 mg/ml by ultrafiltration with a Diaflo XM-300 (Amicon) membrane. The concentrate was then chromatographed on Sephacryl S-300 (40 cm × 1.6 cm, inner diameter) in 25 mM Tris-Cl, 0.25 M sucrose, and 1 mM ATP, pH 8; a typical elution profile is shown in Fig. 1A. Fractions containing the 32-40-ml elution volume (9 mg of protein) were characterized by a constant specific activity, indicating the presence of a single molecular species that was used in the experiments. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed this assertion since even overloading the gel, the typical five-subunit pattern of F1 was observed (Fig. 1B). The enzyme solution was stored at 5°C as a suspension at 50% ammonium sulfate saturation in the presence of 4 mM ATP (pH 8). The enzyme activity was stable for several weeks in this state. Since the technique used in our experiments evaluates the single Trp of F1, it is extremely important that no contaminating protein is present in the enzyme preparation to avoid Trp signals other than that of F1. F1(2,1) was obtained from the above enzyme suspension by centrifugation, and the sedimented enzyme was dissolved at 4-6 μM in a buffer containing 150 mM sucrose, 1 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM K+-Hepes, pH 8; it was desalted on a Sephadex G-50 centrifuge column (42Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) equilibrated with the same buffer. F1(3,0) was prepared from the ammonium sulfate suspension removing unbound nucleotide and desalting by passage through a centrifuge column equilibrated with 150 mM sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 8; it was then followed by a procedure based on the displacement of nucleotides from the catalytic sites by a brief exposure (1 min) to pyrophosphate and removal of unbound nucleotides by gel filtration(20Kironde F.A.S. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12544-12549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F1(3,0) was also prepared from F1(2,1) by substituting pyrophosphate with Mg-GDP, according to (43Peinnequin A. Issartel J.P. Lunardi J. Vignais P.V.

Nd-F1 was prepared from submitochondrial particles by gel permeation chromatography in the presence of 50% glycerol (v/v) as previously described(38Solaini G. Baracca A. Parenti-Castelli G.

All of the F1 preparations were pure and had the typical subunit stoichiometry as evidenced from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). This is of particular importance, since it has been hypothesized that the ε-subunit might be substoichiometric with respect to the rest of the protein(12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), which could result in misinterpretation of the phosphorescence data. The percent volume calculated for the protein bands of a typical F1, using the Molecular Analyst PC image analysis software for the Bio-Rad densitometer (model GS-670) was α+β = 85.81, γ = 9.49, δ = 3.41, and ε = 1.29. The nucleotide content of each enzyme preparation was determined by reverse-phase HPLC, following nucleotide extraction according to Di Pietro et al.(44Di Pietro A. Penin F. Julliard H.J. Godinot C. Gautheron D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The HPLC analysis of the extracts was performed on a Nova-PakTM C18 column (150 × 3.9 mm, 4-μm Nova-PakTM packing material, Waters) equilibrated in 30 mM KH2PO4, pH 5.4, containing 3 mM tetrabuthylammonium sulfate. Nucleotides were eluted with a 0-30% acetonitrile gradient over 25 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Detection was by absorbance at 260 nm. The nucleotide/F1 molar ratios observed were 0.4 ± 0.1 for Nd-F1, 2.8 ± 0.4 for F1(2,1), and 2.6 ± 0.5 for F1(3,0) using a molecular mass of 370 kDa- for the enzyme (6Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Mol.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a polyacrylamide gradient from 14 to 25% containing 0.1% SDS. The procedure has been previously described in detail(46Baracca A. Degli Esposti M. Parenti-Castelli G. Solaini G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 101B: 421-426Google Scholar). The ATPase activity was determined with an ATP regenerating system by following the decrease of NADH absorption at 340 nm in a 7850 model Jasco spectrophotometer. The assay was carried out at substrate-saturating concentration (steady state) as previously reported(38Solaini G. Baracca A. Parenti-Castelli G. Strambini G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the enzyme was 80-100 units/mg protein at 20°C. Protein concentrations of enzyme solutions were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(47Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorescence spectra and decay measurements were obtained with a phosphorimeter, constructed in this institution, as previously described(48Strambini G.B. Biophys. J. 1983; 43: 127-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The photons were generated by a Cernax xenon lamp (LX 150UV, ILC Technology), and the wavelength was set with a 250-nm grating monochromator (Jobin-Yvon, H25). The emission was detected with an EMI 9635 QB photomultiplier. Phosphorescence decay in fluid solution at room temperature was monitored with a homemade apparatus suitable for lifetime measurements in the μs-ms range described in detail elsewhere(75Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Pulsed excitation(λex = 292 nm) was generated by a frequency-doubled flash-pumped dye laser (UV500 M Candela) with a pulse duration of 1 μs and an energy/pulse typically of 1-10 mJ. The sample, placed in a vacuum-proof quartz cuvette that allows excitation of the solution from above, is extensively deoxygenated prior to analysis. The emitted light is measured at 90° from the excitation light and selected by a filter combination in the window between 420 and 480 nm. The photomultipliers are protected from the intense excitation light and fluorescence pulse by a high speed chopper blade that closes the slits during laser excitation. The minimum lag time of the apparatus is about 10 μs. The decay signal was digitized by a computerscope system (ISC-16, RC Electronics) capable of averaging multiple sweeps. Subsequent analysis of decay curves in terms of the sum of exponential components was carried out by a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm implemented by the program Global Analysis (Global Unlimited, LFD University of Illinois, Urbana). For each sample, the phosphorescence decay was measured three times, and samples were prepared at least four times. The standard error of preexponential terms and lifetime components are better than ± 10%. It should be noted, however, that the variability of these parameters can be even somewhat greater when one compares different preparations of the protein. Such variability in the decay kinetics can be traced down to different amounts of quenching impurities present in organic solvents (glycerol), and glasswares(75Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). For this reason, comparisons are always made between samples obtained from the same enzyme preparation. Fig. 2 shows the selected examples of phosphorescence intensity decay of Nd-F1 incubated with adenine nucleotides 1 mM at 293 K. The lifetimes (τ) and the preexponential parameters (α) derived from a biexponential curve fitting are shown in Table 1. Incubation of Nd-F1 with adenine nucleotides at 1 mM in the presence of magnesium changes the intrinsic phosphorescence decay parameters of Nd-F1. ATP decreases the average phosphorescence lifetime from 2.8 to 1.9 ms. This lifetime decrease indicates an enhanced flexibility of the polypeptide chain surrounding the chromophore(35Cioni P. Strambini G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 49Cioni P. Piras L. Strambini G.B. Eur. J.

Thus, the addition of ATP to Nd-F1 induces conformational changes of the protein, resulting in a more flexible environment for the N-terminal segment of the ε-subunit, where Trp is located at position 4(6Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab ADP has an effect opposite that of ATP; it enhances the protein rigidity since the intrinsic τav of the protein increases from 2.8 of Nd-F1 to 3.4 ms upon nucleotide binding. The opposite effect induced on the ε-subunit conformation by ATP and ADP binding suggests that different conformations of the nucleotide binding sites are induced by the two nucleotides and that different allosteric effects are then transmitted to the Trp environment of the ε-subunit. This would be consistent with the idea of several authors who, on the basis of inhibition studies(18Jault J-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 319-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 52Drobinskaya I.Y. Kozlov I.A. Murataliev M.B. Vulfson E.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), speculated that the F1-ATPase complex may exist into two different conformations, Es and Eh, favored by ADP and ATP binding, respectively. When Nd-F1 is incubated with stoichiometric amounts of ADP in the presence of Mg2+, it results in inhibition. It has been shown that the inhibitory ADP is bound in a catalytic site (52Drobinskaya I.Y. Kozlov I.A. Murataliev M.B. Vulfson E.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 53Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 54Chernyak B.V. Cross R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To establish whether the binding of ADP to this high affinity catalytic site affects the conformation of the ε-subunit, ADP has been added stoichiometrically to Nd-F1. The decay parameters (Table 1) do not change significantly with respect to control, indicating a lack of influence of ADP filling the high affinity catalytic site on the conformation of the protein at the ε-subunit level. Also, the addition of stoichiometric ATP to Nd-F1 (i.e. conditions for unisite catalysis as in (55Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) does not affect the Trp phosphorescence decay. Therefore, independent of the adenine nucleotide tested, it would appear reasonable to conclude that filling the high affinity catalytic site does not result in conformational changes of the protein involving the N-terminal segment of the ε-subunit. To further investigate which nucleotide site(s) of F1 have to be occupied to induce ε-subunit conformational changes, preparations of F1 at different levels of nucleotide occupancy of sites have been studied. Preliminarily, we obtained the phosphorescence spectra of the F1(2,1) form in glycerol-phosphate buffer glass at 140 K (not shown), and we observed that the spectra are essentially identical to that of Nd-F1 previously reported (38Solaini G. Baracca A. Parenti-Castelli G. Strambini G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This implies that the nucleotide binding to the high affinity sites does not change the physico-chemical environment of the ε-subunit Trp. Incubation of F1(2,1) with 1 mM Mg-ADP, 1 mM Mg-ATP, or 0.5 mM Mg-GTP at 293 K in 150 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM Hepes, pH 8, induces consistent changes of the phosphorescence decay (Fig. 3). Table 1 shows the phosphorescence decay parameters of a typical experiment. The data clearly display a significant decrease of the average lifetime from 4.3 to 3.3 and 3.5 ms when ATP or GTP are bound, respectively. This indicates an increased flexibility of the chromophore environment upon occupancy of the vacant nucleotide binding sites by NTP, whereas ADP has an opposite effect since it enhances τav to 4.6 ms (Table 1). Thus, the results are similar to those observed on Nd-F1, providing further support to the conclusion that 1) occupation of loose binding site(s) is responsible for the ε-subunit structural change and 2) binding of the nucleoside triphosphate increases the flexibility of the Trp environment, whereas the binding of nucleoside diphosphate enhances its rigidity (Mg2+ present). It has been shown that addition of ATP or ADP plus Pi in the presence of magnesium results in a reactivation of the AMP-PNP-inhibited ATP hydrolysis activity of the enzyme(56Nalin C.M. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8055-8060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similar behavior of ATP or ADP plus Pi has prompted investigation with respect to similar effect of the ligands on the F1 conformation. Thus, experiments designed to determine whether inorganic phosphate added together with ADP might have the capability to influence the ε-subunit conformation similarly to ATP were initiated. For this purpose, F1 was incubated in the presence of ADP + Mg2+ over a range of 0.1-10 mM Pi (i.e. the physiological range, according to (57Kamp G. Juretschke H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 929: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and (58Kawano Y. Tanokura M. Yamada K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 407: 243-261Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), with care being taken to exclude adventitious Pi from enzyme and buffers. This treatment did not alter significantly the effect of ADP alone on the phosphorescence decay parameters of the enzyme (Table 1), indicating that the activation"
