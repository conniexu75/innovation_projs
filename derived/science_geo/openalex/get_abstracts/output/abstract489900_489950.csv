https://openalex.org/W2056219686,"Three neonicotinoids, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiacloprid, agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the central brain of insects, were applied at non-lethal doses in order to test their effects on honeybee navigation. A catch-and-release experimental design was applied in which feeder trained bees were caught when arriving at the feeder, treated with one of the neonicotinoids, and released 1.5 hours later at a remote site. The flight paths of individual bees were tracked with harmonic radar. The initial flight phase controlled by the recently acquired navigation memory (vector memory) was less compromised than the second phase that leads the animal back to the hive (homing flight). The rate of successful return was significantly lower in treated bees, the probability of a correct turn at a salient landscape structure was reduced, and less directed flights during homing flights were performed. Since the homing phase in catch-and-release experiments documents the ability of a foraging honeybee to activate a remote memory acquired during its exploratory orientation flights, we conclude that non-lethal doses of the three neonicotinoids tested either block the retrieval of exploratory navigation memory or alter this form of navigation memory. These findings are discussed in the context of the application of neonicotinoids in plant protection."
https://openalex.org/W2037871836,"Mitochondrial dysfunction plays important roles in many diseases, but there is no satisfactory method to assess mitochondrial health in vivo. Here, we engineered a MitoTimer reporter gene from the existing Timer reporter gene. MitoTimer encodes a mitochondria-targeted green fluorescent protein when newly synthesized, which shifts irreversibly to red fluorescence when oxidized. Confocal microscopy confirmed targeting of the MitoTimer protein to mitochondria in cultured cells, Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons, Drosophila melanogaster heart and indirect flight muscle, and mouse skeletal muscle. A ratiometric algorithm revealed that conditions that cause mitochondrial stress led to a significant shift toward red fluorescence as well as accumulation of pure red fluorescent puncta of damaged mitochondria targeted for mitophagy. Long term voluntary exercise resulted in a significant fluorescence shift toward green, in mice and D. melanogaster, as well as significantly improved structure and increased content in mouse FDB muscle. In contrast, high-fat feeding in mice resulted in a significant shift toward red fluorescence and accumulation of pure red puncta in skeletal muscle, which were completely ameliorated by voluntary wheel running. Hence, MitoTimer allows for robust analysis of multiple parameters of mitochondrial health under both physiological and pathological conditions and will be highly useful for future research of mitochondrial health in multiple disciplines in vivo.

Despite the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in a myriad of pathological conditions, very few effective drugs and interventions are available for their prevention and treatment.

Two other reporter genes, HyPer and mt-cpYFP, have also been developed to detect H2O2 and superoxide in mitochondria, respectively (16.Roma L.P. Duprez J. Takahashi H.K. Gilon P. Wiederkehr A.

These reagents are extremely useful for real-time measurement in cultured cells as they report instant changes in ROS production and redox state, but cannot be readily used for in vivo measurements because the readouts change instantaneously. Transmission electron microscopy is currently used for assessing mitochondrial quantity and structural integrity in whole organisms; however, the use of transmission electron microscopy is limited due to the high monetary and labor costs and the contingency on specialized equipment. It is therefore of great value to develop tools for assessing mitochondrial health with the ability to trace their history. To this end we engineered a pMitoTimer reporter gene by targeting a fluorescent Timer protein to mitochondria by adding the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII gene to the N terminus of the coding region of Timer, under control of the constitutive CMV promoter. Timer encodes a DsRed mutant (DsRed1-E5) that fluoresces like green fluorescence protein when newly synthesized, and shifts the fluorescent spectrum irreversibly to red (18.Terskikh A. Fradkov A.

This physical property in a biological environment makes it suitable for reporting the age of proteins and cells (18.Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X.

Siebert P. “Fluorescent timer”: protein that changes color with time.Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and thus was named “Timer.” Recently, Ferree et al. (21.Ferree A.W. Trudeau K. Zik E. Benador I.Y. Twig G. Gottlieb R.A. Shirihai O.S.

(22.Hernandez G. Thornton C. Stotland A. Lui D. Sin J. Ramil J. Magee N. Andres A. Quarato G. Carreira R.S. Sayen M.R. Wolkowicz R. Gottlieb R.A.

Because the fluorescence spectrum shifts upon oxidation, we predicted that MitoTimer driven by a constitutively active promoter would report cumulative redox history of the labeled mitochondria. We also provide additional value by using MitoTimer in vivo in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster as well as following somatic gene transfer in adult mouse skeletal muscle. Here we have validated the reporter properties and confirmed that MitoTimer could be used to report mitochondrial content, structure, stress, and damage in vivo under physiological and pathological conditions. We also used MitoTimer to address a biological question of whether exercise training was protective against HFD-induced mitochondrial damage in mouse skeletal muscle. Our findings provide morphological evidence demonstrating HFD-induced mitochondrial defects in vivo using two independent methods (transmission electron microscopy and MitoTimer fluorescence), and the benefits of exercise training for mitochondrial health. This reporter gene can be potentially used in multiple disease models, and its applications, beyond this study, will likely lead to advancement in multiple disciplines of mitochondrial health research. We constructed pMitoTimer by inserting the BamHI-NotI fragments of pTimer-1 (Clontech) into pDsRed2-Mito (Clontech) vector digested with BamHI and NotI using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) following DNA isolation by using the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The mitochondrial targeting sequence of the human cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII gene from pDsRed2-Mito was then fused to the mutant DsRed1-E5 on the N terminus. Bacterial colonies were screened using a Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) with restriction mapping and transfection in C2C12 myoblasts to confirm the correct construction of the plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA pLamp1-YFP was purchased (Addgene). Mouse C2C12 myoblasts were cultured on glass coverslips in normal growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose containing 20% fetal bovine serum) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were transfected with pMitoTimer, pTimer, pDsRed-Mito, pGFP3, or the empty vector, pCI-neo (Promega). Briefly, the cells were incubated with a mixture of 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM media for 5 h at 37 °C before changing to normal growth medium with an overnight incubation. The cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed with 4% paraformaldhyde for 15 min on ice followed by 2 × 5-min washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides, and images were acquired by confocal microscopy (Olympus) for both green (excitation/emission 488/518 nm) and red (excitation/emission 543/572 nm) channels. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were isolated from transfected C2C12 myoblasts using a mitochondrial isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). These fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-DsRed (Clontech), mouse anti-COX IV (Invitrogen), and mouse anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse IR680 and goat anti-rabbit IR800 (LICOR). Membranes were scanned using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR). pMitoTimer-transfected C2C12 myoblasts were treated with 10 μm rotenone (electron transport chain complex I inhibitor; Sigma), 100 nm antimycin A (complex III inhibitor; Sigma), or 100 μm paraquat (mitochondrial ROS producer primarily through complex I) in normal growth medium for 6 h. In experiments using diethylenetriamine-nitric oxide, cells were pre-treated with 200 μm diethylenetriamine-NO for 1 h prior to co-treatment with either antimycin A or dimethyl sulfoxide for 6 h. Cells were fixed and mounted immediately following drug treatment for confocal microscopy analysis. To assess the effect of the drug treatment to mitochondrial function, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with the same drugs for 6 h prior to measurement of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using a Seahorse XF-24 Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, Billerica, MA). Briefly, prior to the assay, the media was changed to 5 mm HEPES-buffered Seahorse medium (Invitrogen) (pH 7.4) and equilibrated for 30 min at 37 °C. Oligomycin (Oligo, 1 μm), BAM15 (23.Kenwood B.M.

Metab. 2014; 3: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (2 μm), and rotenone and antimycin A (1 and 10 μm, respectively) were injected sequentially during the assay, whereas OCR was measured at 3-min intervals. OCR was normalized to α-Tubulin protein abundance in harvested cells following completion of the assay. Basal mitochondrial OCR, ATP-linked OCR, and reserve capacity were calculated. Wild type (w1118) and Mef2-Gal4 fly lines were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (Indiana University, IN). Flies were housed in a humidified, temperature-controlled incubator at 25 °C on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. To generate the MitoTimer transgenic fly line, the coding region of MitoTimer was subcloned into pUAS vector. A UAS-MitoTimer transgenic fly line was established commercially (Genetic Services, Inc.). UAS-MitoTimer flies were crossed with Mef2-Gal4 to obtain Mef2-Gal4>UAS-MitoTimer flies. Adult female flies were collected under light CO2 anesthesia and transferred to fresh medium every 2–3 days (20 per vial). To induce oxidative stress in Drosophila, we prepared the drugs as following. Antimycin A was dissolved in 100% ethanol at 1 mm and then added to 5% sucrose at 0.1 mm. Paraquat was dissolved in water at 100 mm and added to 5% sucrose at 10 mm. These two drugs were administered to adult flies (20 days old) 24 h after 6 h of fasting as described by Lee et al. (24.Lee K.S. Iijima-Ando K. Iijima K. Lee W.J. Lee J.H. Yu K. Lee D.S. JNK/FOXO-mediated neuronal expression of fly homologue of peroxiredoxin II reduces oxidative stress and extends life span.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29454-29461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Rotenone was first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 4 mm, added to freshly made fly food at 60 °C at 0.4 mm, and used to feed the flies for 4 days after 6 h of fasting (25.Coulom H. Birman S. Chronic exposure to rotenone models sporadic Parkinson's disease in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10993-10998Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Exercise training of UAS-MitoTimer:Mef2-Gal4 flies were performed according to a previously reported method (26.Piazza N. Gosangi B. Devilla S. Arking R. Wessells R. Exercise-training in young Drosophila melanogaster reduces age-related decline in mobility and cardiac performance.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Negative geotaxis was assessed in Rapid Negative Geotaxis (RING) assays in groups of 100 flies as described (27.Gargano J.W. Martin I. Bhandari P. Grotewiel M.S. Rapid iterative negative geotaxis (RING): a new method for assessing age-related locomotor decline in Drosophila.Exp. Gerontol. 2005; 40: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Flies were tested 5 times per week for 5 weeks to assess the decline in negative geotaxis speed with age. Climbing endurance was measured using the fatigue assay as previously described (28.Tinkerhess M.J. Ginzberg S. Piazza N. Wessells R.J. Endurance training protocol and longitudinal performance assays for Drosophila melanogaster.J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 61: e3786Google Scholar). Adult fly hearts were dissected according to an established method (29.Vogler G. Ocorr K. Visualizing the beating heart in Drosophila.J. Vis. Exp. 2009; 31: e1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Confocal Z-stack images were obtained within abdominal segment A1 with a set of fixed acquisition parameters. One set of images per heart, both green (excitation/emission 488/518 nm) and red (excitation/emission 543/572 nm) channels, were selected for analysis that was 6–8 nm from the top section. Pmec-3MitoTimer was constructed by digesting pPD57.56 with BamHI and NheI and inserting a PCR fragment that contained the DsRed-2 mitochondrial portion of pTimer-1 also cut with BamHI and NheI. The sequence-confirmed plasmid was injected into wild type C. elegans to generate strain ZB4043 bzEx217[Pttx-3mCherry; Pmec-3MitoTimer] in which MitoTimer was expressed in 10 neurons including the touch receptor neurons. We imaged using a Zeiss Axoivert 200M upright microscope with deconvolution. Male C57BL/6J mice (7–8 weeks old) were obtained commercially (Jackson Laboratory) and housed in temperature-controlled (21 °C) quarters with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and water and chow (Purina) provided ad libitum. All experimental protocols were approved by the University of Virginia, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. pMitoTimer and pLamp1-YFP transfection by somatic gene transfer in the adult mouse FDB muscle was performed as previously published (30.DiFranco M. Quinonez M. Capote J. Vergara J. DNA transfection of mammalian skeletal muscles using in vivo electroporation.J. Vis. Exp. 2009; 32: e1520PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized (isofluorane) and the base of each hind limb foot, where the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle is located, was injected with 10 μl of hyaluronidase (0.36 mg/ml; Sigma) subcutaneously. One h later, the mice were anesthetized a second time and the FDB injected with 20 μg of pMitoTimer in saline. In the case of co-transfection, pMitoTimer and pLamp1-YFP were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and 20 μg of plasmid DNA was injected. Following another 10 min, a pair of gold-plated acupuncture needles were inserted under the skin at the heel of the foot and the base of the toes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the long axis of the foot. Ten pulses with 20 ms duration at 1 Hz and 75 V/cm were applied to each foot. Following somatic gene transfer, the mice were allowed to recover for 10 days and were then allocated to one of the following groups (n = 6); sedentary normal chow (NC-Sed), sedentary with 60% high-fat diet (HFD-Sed); Research Diets Inc.), voluntary wheel running with NC (NC-Ex), or voluntary wheel running with 60% HFD (HFD-Ex) for 3 weeks. In a separate experiment, the mice (n = 6) were allocated to either sedentary (Sed) or voluntary wheel running (Ex) for 6 weeks. All mice were housed individually in cages with running wheels, and the running wheels were locked for the mice allocated to the sedentary groups. At the end of the studies, all mice were humanely sacrificed under anesthesia, and FDB muscles were carefully excised and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. For detection of Cox4, pMitoTimer-transfected FDB muscles were processed for paraffin embedding as described (31.Gomez D. Shankman L.S. Nguyen A.T. Owens G.K. Detection of histone modifications at specific gene loci in single cells in histological sections.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested muscles were placed in 10% formalin at room temperature overnight. Samples were transferred to 70% ethanol before being paraffin-embedded and sectioned by a microtome. The sections were incubated in a dry 37 °C incubator overnight before being deparaffinized and rehydrated in a series of xylene and ethanol washes. Muscle sections (5 μm) were then washed for 10 min in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween 20, followed by incubating with blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum in TBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with mouse anti-Cox4 antibody (Invitrogen A21348, 1:100) in TBS overnight at 4 °C, washed for 10 min in 0.1% Tween 20 TBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse Cy5 antibody (Jackson 115-175-146, 1:50) followed by mounting with Pro-Long Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen) for confocal microscopy. For detections of LC3, pMitoTimer-transfected FDB muscles were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and incubated overnight in PBS with 0.2% saponin at 4 °C. Muscles were then incubated in blocking solution (PBS with 0.5% BSA, 0.2% saponin, 3% normal goat serum, and 3% normal rat serum) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with rabbit anit-LC3 (Novus Biologics, NB100-2220; 1:300) in blocking solution at 4 °C. Following 5 × 20-min washes in PBS with 0.2% saponin, muscles were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Cy5 antibody (Jackson 111-175-144, 1:200) for 2 h at room temperature and washes were repeated. Muscles were then whole mounted and imaged by confocal microscopy as described. Immediately following fixation (described above) the muscles were whole mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides with 50% glycerol in PBS with a coverslip. MitoTimer images were acquired at ×100 magnification under a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV1000) using the green (excitation/emission 488/518 nm) and red (excitation/emission 543/572 nm) channels with identical predetermined acquisition parameters for all samples to ensure no saturation of the signals and similar intensity of the green and red channels in control samples. Lamp1-YFP images were acquired using the yellow channel (excitation/emission 515/527 nm), whereas LC3 and Cox4 immunofluorescence (Cy5) was detected in the far-red spectrum (excitation/emission 635/672 nm). MitoTimer signals were analyzed using our custom-designed Matlab-based algorithm. Briefly, positive pixels were thresholded at a value of 1.5 times the mean gray value of the above background pixels for each channel. This made the threshold robust against differences in fiber size between images. Saturated pixels (gray level = 255) were removed from analysis. In addition, the pixels with a red to green ratio of >2.5 were removed for the ratiometric analysis. The ratio of red to green was calculated as a mean value of red to green ratio for all the remaining positive pixels in the image (Fig. 2c). The number of red dots in the images was calculated by counting areas with clusters of ≥5 pixels with high fluorescence signal (>175) and a red to green ratio of >2.5. The red dot counting was done on images including saturated pixels (Fig. 2d). Transmission electron microscopy was performed as previously described (32.Miller S.E. Howell D.N. Viral infections in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1988; 8: 41-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed using a t test or one-way analysis of variance with Student's Newman-Kuels post hoc where appropriate. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We engineered the MitoTimer reporter gene to target the oxidation-sensitive Timer protein to mitochondria. To confirm the subcellular location, we transiently transfected C2C12 myoblasts with plasmid pMitoTimer (Fig. 1a) and compared the expression pattern with those of pGFP3, pDsRed-Mito, and pTimer-1 (Fig. 1b). Cells transfected with pMitoTimer showed typical mitochondrial network structures (Fig. 1a) identical to those transfected with pDsRed-Mito (Fig. 1b). Cells transfected with pMitoTimer also showed heterogeneous green and red fluorescence (Fig. 1a, panel labeled Merge), similar to that of pTimer-1 (Fig. 1b). Mitochondrial targeting of the protein was further confirmed by Western blot of the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of C2C12 myoblasts transiently transfected with pMitoTimer compared with cells transfected with an empty vector, pCI-neo (Fig. 1c). MitoTimer protein was highly enriched in the mitochondrial fraction as probed by anti-DsRed antibodies (Fig. 1c). To validate these findings in vivo, we generated transgenic C. elegans with touch neuron-specific expression under control of the neuron-specific promoter mec-4 and observed green and red mitochondria in the soma and distributed through the sensory neuron process (Fig. 1d), which is similar to mitochondrial targeted standard GFP as reported"

This cluster was found to facilitate T cell proliferation, enhance antitumor activities and promote T cell-dependent antibody responses. However, little is known about the role of this miRNA cluster in the development of autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis is a neuro-destructive autoimmune disease caused by the pathogenicity of TH17 cells, whose differentiation is tightly controlled by a variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators. Our study unveils the critical role of miR-17-92 in TH17 differentiation: T cell-specific miR-17-92 deficiency reduced TH17 differentiation and ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) symptoms. We demonstrated that miR-17 and miR-19b are the two miRNAs in this cluster responsible for promoting TH17 responses. MiR-19b represses the expression of Phosphatase and Tensin Homology (PTEN), thereby augmenting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis essential for proper TH17 differentiation. Meanwhile, miR-17 enhances TH17 polarization by inhibiting a novel target, Ikaros Family Zinc Finger 4 (IKZF4). By establishing the miR-17-92 cluster as a key driver of TH17 responses, our data identify this miRNA cluster as a potential therapeutic target for the clinical intervention of multiple sclerosis.

Mature miRNAs are mounted onto the RNA-induced silencing complex which interacts with a particular mRNA molecule. This process leads to translational repression and/or RNA decay of target mRNA (1.Fabian M.R. Sonenberg N. Filipowicz W. Regulation of mRNA translation and stability by microRNAs.Annu. Rev.

As a critical compartment of the adaptive immune system, CD4+ T cells are well recognized by their capability of differentiating into various T cell subtypes to accomplish different tasks: TH1 cells secrete IFNγ and are involved in anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity; TH2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 to defend against helminth infection; TH17 cells can produce IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23 and controls fungi invasion; T follicular helper cells (TFH) supports B cell affinity maturation to elicit proper humoral immunity; Tregs, on the other hand, downscale immune responses to prevent excessive inflammation (6.Zhu J.F. Yamane H. Paul W.E. Differentiation of Effector CD4 T Cell Populations.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 445-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). Among the numerous immunoregulatory miRNA species, the miR-17-92 cluster had been suggested to play pivotal roles in the regulation of immune responses, including CD4+ T cell differentiation. MiR-17-92 was the first “oncomiR” ever identified: its expression was highly elevated in lymphoma B cell from cancer patients and its overexpression accelerated tumorigenesis (7.He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Hannon G.J. Hammond S.M. A microRNA polycistron as a potential human oncogene.Nature. 2005; 435: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar); on the other hand, in the immune system, our group demonstrated that miR-17-92 is indispensable for anti-tumor CD4+ T cell responses by enhancing IFNγ-secreting TH1 differentiation and by supporting tumor-specific T cell survival and proliferation (8.Jiang S. Li C. Olive V. Lykken E. Feng F. Sevilla J. Wan Y. He L. Li Q.J. Molecular dissection of the miR-17-92 cluster's critical dual roles in promoting Th1 responses and preventing inducible Treg differentiation.Blood. 2011; 118: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These pro-inflammatory functions of this unique cluster were complemented by recent reports that miR-17-92 is essential for eliciting optimal antibody responses by affecting TFH differentiation (9.Baumjohann D. Kageyama R. Clingan J.M. Morar M.M. Patel S. de Kouchkovsky D. Bannard O. Bluestone J.A. Matloubian M. Ansel K.M. Jeker L.T.

MicroRNAs of the miR-17 approximately 92 family are critical regulators of T(FH) differentiation.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, miR-17-92 also carries a mechanism that biases CD4+ T cells away from immune tolerant Treg induction. In the absence of miR-17-92, CD4+ T cells were poised for strong iTreg differentiation (8.Jiang S. Li C. Olive V. Lykken E. Feng F. Sevilla J. Wan Y. He L. Li Q.J. Molecular dissection of the miR-17-92 cluster's critical dual roles in promoting Th1 responses and preventing inducible Treg differentiation.Blood. 2011; 118: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar); and, thymic-derived Tregs critically rely on miR-17-92 for their IL-10 production and immune suppressive functions (11.de Kouchkovsky D. Esensten J.H. Rosenthal W.L. Morar M.M. Bluestone J.A. Jeker L.T. microRNA-17-92 regulates IL-10 production by regulatory T cells and control of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 2013; 191: 1594-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although miR-17-92's regulatory functions have been elaborated in a variety of immunological responses, its effect in autoimmunity was not well established. Some evidence suggests this cluster may be involved in multiple sclerosis (MS), as one member of miR-17-92, miR-17 was shown to be up-regulated in MS patients (12.Lindberg R.L. Hoffmann F. Mehling M. Kuhle J. Kappos L. Altered expression of miR-17-5p in CD4+ lymphocytes of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients.Eur. J. Immunol. 2010; 40: 888-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). MS is an autoimmunity-mediated neuro-demyelination disease elicited by the activation of TH17 cells. Besides its pivotal role in anti-fungal responses, TH17 is also a pathogenic branch of CD4+ T cells contributing to the onset of various autoimmune diseases, including MS (13.Korn T. Bettelli E.

In MS patients, myelin specific TH17 cells infiltrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-17 (16.Chung Y. Yang X. Chang S.H. Ma L.

IL-17 was also shown to directly target glial cells, which potentially impedes myelin repair and aggravates disease progression (19.Kang Z. Wang C. Zepp J. Wu L. Sun K. Zhao J. Chandrasekharan U.

Because of the importance of TH17-mediated pathogenesis in MS, key regulators of TH17 differentiation have been extensively studied (20.Ivanov II McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A.

Dynamic regulatory network controlling TH17 cell differentiation.Nature. 2013; 496: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, since the role of miR-17-92 in TH17 lineage is yet to be investigated, it is unclear whether this transcription factor network relates to the post-transcriptional regulatory network of miR-17-92. In this study, we utilized a mouse strain in which miR-17-92 was specifically depleted in T cells. In combination with the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, we showed that loss of miR-17-92 resulted in impaired TH17 differentiation, which consequently reduced EAE pathogenesis. We further dissected this cluster and identified specific miRNAs executing the whole cluster's function. Through identification of their functionally relevant gene targets, we elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying these regulatory miRNAs. miR-17-92f/f and Rag2−/− mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. CD4-Cre mice were purchased from Taconic. CD4+ T cell conditional miR-17-92 knock-out mice were generated by mating miR-17-92f/f and CD4-Cre mice and back-crossing to the C57BL/6 background. All animal-related procedures were conducted with the approval from the Duke University Animal Care and Use Committee. For in vitro cultures, total lymph nodes or spleen were collected from mice and single cell suspension was prepared. CD4+ Cells were then purified with Dynabeads® UntouchedTM Mouse CD4 Cells kit (Invitrogen). Cells were stimulated by 1 μg/ml plate-bond α-CD3 and α-CD28antibodies. 10 μg/ml α-IFNγ, 10 μg/ml α-IL-4, 50 ng/ml mouse IL-6, 4 ng/ml human TGFβ, 20 ng/ml mouse IL-1β, and 50 ng/ml IL-23 were added in the culture for TH17 polarization. Antibodies described above were purchased from BioXCell, and cytokines from Biolegend. PIK-75 (PI3K inhibitor) was purchased from EMD Biosciences (#528116) and was applied at the concentration of 25 nm. miRNA overexpression vectors were constructed with MSCV retrovirus backbone, and retroviruses were generated by transfecting the BOSC 23 packaging cell line. Viruses were harvested from the supernatant 48 h post-transfection. Retroviruses were then used to infect activated T cells by centrifugation at 1258 × g at 37 °C. RNA was extracted from cells by mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using qScriptTM Flex cDNA kit (Quanta Biosciences). Quantitative PCR was conducted with PerfeCTa® SYBR® Green FastMix® (Quanta). 96-well qPCR array primers were synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies. miRNA-target binding was predicted using online algorithm TargetScan. Luciferase reporter vector was constructed by cloning target 3′-UTR downstream of firefly luciferase. This vector also contains Renilla luciferase transcribed from a separate promoter. By normalizing firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase, the repression efficacy of miRNA was assessed. Western blot was performed using Novex® 10% Tris-Glycin Gel (Invitrogen). Primary antibody α-IKZF4 was acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-292209), α-Actinβ from Sigma-Aldrich. Secondary antibody α-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 680 was purchased from Invitrogen. Flow cytometry antibodies were purchased from Biologend. For surface staining, the cells were harvested and stained in FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS and 2 mm EDTA). For intracellular cytokine staining, the cells were harvested and further stimulated with 500 ng/ml Ionomycin and 1 μm PdBU (Sigma Aldrich) in the presence of Golgi block Monensin and Brefeldin A (eBioscience) for 4 h, followed by fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS and permeabilization in 0.1% Saponin-FACS buffer. For Foxp3 stanining, cells were processed and stained with Foxp3 staining buffer kit (eBioscience). For intracellular IKZF4 staining, the cells were first fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS and permeabilized in 90% methanol-PBS. Subsequently, cells were subjected to primary rabbit-α-mouse IKZF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and secondary antibody staining (Jackson Immunoresearch). Flow cytometry was conducted with BD FACSCantoTM II analyzer. 125 μg of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35–55 peptide was emulsified in complete freund's adjuvant (CFA). The mix was injected into the mouse subcutaneously. 200 ng/mouse of pertussis toxin was injected intravenously on day 0 and day 2 postimmunization. Clinical score was assessed on a daily basis according to the extent of paralysis: no clinical symptoms (0); limp tail (1); weak paralysis of two hind limbs (2); complete paralysis of two hind limbs (3); paralysis of both hind and fore limbs (4); death (5). Mouse CD4+CD25−CD45RBHi naïve T cells were sorted from donor mice and 0.5 million cells were injected into recipient mice intraperitoneally. Mouse body weights were monitored on a daily basis. At the experiment end-point, mice were sacrificed and the colon weight/length ratios were measured. Mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were collected, and T cells were analyzed for intracellular expression of IL-17A and IFNγ expression by flow cytometry. Two-tailed Student's t tests were used to determine whether the means from two experimental groups were significantly different. p values of <0.05 was indicative of significant difference. In certain time-course studies, the difference between two groups were accessed via testing whether the regression slope were significantly different. p value of <0.05 indicates the samples of interest do not derive from a single population. To investigate the role of miR-17-92 cluster in the differentiation of TH17 cells, we employed the miR-17-92f/f-CD4-Cre conditional knock-out mouse as previously described (8.Jiang S. Li C. Olive V. Lykken E. Feng F. Sevilla J. Wan Y. He L. Li Q.J. Molecular dissection of the miR-17-92 cluster's critical dual roles in promoting Th1 responses and preventing inducible Treg differentiation.Blood. 2011; 118: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This mouse line features two loxp sites flanking the whole miRNA cluster (24.Ventura A. Young A.G. Winslow M.M. Lintault L. Meissner A. Erkeland S.J. Newman J. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Stone J.R. Jaenisch R. Sharp P.A. Jacks T. Targeted deletion reveals essential and overlapping functions of the miR-17 similar to 92 family of miRNA clusters.Cell. 2008; 132: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar), together with Cre expression under the control of CD4 promoter to ensure T cell-specific miR-17-92 depletion. With these mice, we first tested whether miR-17-92 cluster affects TH17 differentiation in vitro. Using plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, CD4+ T cells from total lymph nodes of either wild type (WT), miR-17-92 heterozygotes (f/+) or miR-17-92 knock-out (f/f) mouse were stimulated through their antigen receptors. The cells were cultured under TH17 polarization conditions to assess their differentiation capacity. TH17 differentiation of miR-17-92-deficient T cells was markedly decreased in vitro, as identified by reduced IL-17A production (Fig. 1A). We next studied the impact of this impaired TH17 differentiation in vivo using the EAE mouse model of MS. Since TH17 cells are known to be the critical mediators of MS in human patients, we induced EAE in either wild-type (WT) mice or miR-17-92f/f-CD4-Cre (KO) mice. In KO mice, we observed alleviation in EAE symptoms, as indicated by reduced clinical scores (Fig. 1B). We found no significant differences in the numbers of pathological CD4+ T cells infiltrating the central nervous system (Fig. 1C). However, a closer examination at the effector function of these CD4+ T cells revealed that KO cells collected from the spinal cords and spleens of EAE mice had significantly diminished IL-17 expression (Fig. 1, D and E), together, the IL-17 producing cell number was also significantly decreased (supplemental Fig. S1). Consistent with our previous findings that miR-17-92 facilitates IFNγ production (8.Jiang S. Li C. Olive V. Lykken E. Feng F. Sevilla J. Wan Y. He L. Li Q.J. Molecular dissection of the miR-17-92 cluster's critical dual roles in promoting Th1 responses and preventing inducible Treg differentiation.Blood. 2011; 118: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), we also observed a significant decrease in IFNγ producing T cells in the spinal cord. However, although the loss of miR-17-92 enhanced iTreg induction in vitro and within the tumor microenvironment (8.Jiang S. Li C. Olive V. Lykken E. Feng F. Sevilla J. Wan Y. He L. Li Q.J. Molecular dissection of the miR-17-92 cluster's critical dual roles in promoting Th1 responses and preventing inducible Treg differentiation.Blood. 2011; 118: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), under our EAE inducing condition, we were unable to identify differences in Treg percentages between WT and KO mice, in both the spinal cords and spleens (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our data suggest that miR-17-92 is important for TH17 differentiation in vitro and TH17 responses in vivo and the ablation of this cluster mitigates EAE progression. We next validated the function of miR-17-92 in TH17 induction using the colitis model. In lymphopenic Rag2−/− mouse, the adoptively transferred naïve CD4+ T cells become activated and differentiate into TH1 and TH17 lineages to induce colitis (25.Hue S. Ahern P. Buonocore S. Kullberg M.C. Cua D.J. McKenzie B.S. Powrie F. Maloy K.J. Interleukin-23 drives innate and T cell-mediated intestinal inflammation.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2473-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). We adoptively transferred CD4+CD25−CD45RBHi naïve WT or KO T cells into the Rag2−/− hosts, and monitored their body weights daily. Compared with WT T cells, we found that KO T cells were ineffectual at eliciting colitis-induced weight loss: in recipients of KO T cells, weight loss was significantly retarded (Fig. 2A). In addition, the colon weight/length ratio, an indicator of colon inflammation severity, was significantly reduced in mice receiving KO T cells (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, H&E staining of the colon sections revealed stark differences between the two groups of recipient mice: in the colons of mice receiving WT T cells, there was drastic loss of villus integrity, together with substantial infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells into the villi, and, severe depletion of goblet cells; In the colons of mice receiving KO T cells, while mononuclear infiltration was present, the gross architecture of both villi and goblet cells remained intact (Fig. 2C). Further analysis revealed that miR-17-92 deletion results in significantly reduced accumulation of CD4+ cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 2D), which is likely a consequence of reduced proliferation and increased activation-induced apoptosis associated with miR-17-92 deletion (8.Jiang S. Li C. Olive V. Lykken E. Feng F. Sevilla J. Wan Y. He L. Li Q.J. Molecular dissection of the miR-17-92 cluster's critical dual roles in promoting Th1 responses and preventing inducible Treg differentiation.Blood. 2011; 118: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). More importantly, while IFNγ production was comparable between two groups in this disease model (Fig. 2E), we observed suppressed IL-17A expression in transferred KO T cells (Fig. 2F). Notably, in our colitis model, iTreg differentiation was negligible in either WT or KO CD4+ T cell transfer (supplemental Fig. S2). Our data imply that miR-17-92 deficiency hinders the CD4+ cells' ability to induce colitis, potentially by reducing TH17 responses. To better understand the mechanism by which miR-17-92 cluster regulates TH17 differentiation, we dissected the contribution from individual miRNAs in this cluster. By utilizing retroviral vectors to overexpress individual miRNAs in miR-17-92 knock-out T cells, we were able to achieve miRNA expression above the wild type level (supplemental Fig. S3). We then found that two miRNAs, miR-17 and miR-19b, were most potent in rescuing the TH17 differentiation defect (Fig. 3, A and B). We then asked if miR-17 and miR-19b promotes TH17 differentiation in an additive or synergistic manner. To examine their combinatory effects, we designed a retroviral vector that expresses a miR-17-92 mutant, miR-1719b. miR-1719b harbors deletions of the miR-19a and miR-20a guide strands, and contains mutations covering the whole seed regions of miR-18 and miR-92. This allows us to overexpress miR-17 and miR-19b simultaneously in the context of their original cluster (Fig. 3C). Combined miR-17 and miR-19b expression demonstrated an additive effect in driving TH17 differentiation of KO CD4+ T cells in comparison to those cells expressing miR-17 or miR-19b alone (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, the transcription of il17a, il17f, and master regulator rorc were also highly induced by concurrent expression of miR-17 and miR-19b (Fig. 3D). Collectively, by breaking down the miR-17-92 cluster into individual miRNAs, we demonstrated that miR-17 and miR-19b are potentially the major players in promoting TH17 differentiation. We then examined how miR-19b functions to foster TH17 differentiation. We and others have validated phosphatase and tensin homology (PTEN) as a target of miR-19b in tumor cells, B cells, and CD4+ T cells (8.Jiang S. Li C. Olive V. Lykken E. Feng F. Sevilla J. Wan Y.

By dephosphorylating PIP3, PTEN is well recognized as a negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (27.Carracedo A. Pandolfi P.P. The PTEN-PI3K pathway: of feedbacks and cross-talks.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5527-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Importantly, recent studies imply that activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the induction of TH17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo (28.Nagai S. Kurebayashi Y. Koyasu S. Role of PI3K/Akt and mTOR complexes in Th17 cell differentiation.Ann. NY Acad Sci. 2013; 1280: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that miR-19b promotes TH17 response through the inhibition of PTEN to enhance the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. We first confirmed that miR-19b overexpression is capable of down-regulating PTEN during the differentiation of TH17 cells (Fig. 4A). One direct consequence of PTEN dysregulation is the alteration of AKT activation, marked by the phosphorylation of two critical residues on AKT: threonine 308 (T308) and serine 473 (S473) (29.Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J.N. Tsichlis P. Akt activation by growth factors is a multiple-step process: the role of the PH domain.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). When we activated WT and KO CD4+ T cells via TCR stimulation under the TH17-differentiating conditions, we observed that both T308 and S473 phosphorylation were significantly retarded in KO cells (Fig. 4B). We then examined whether this miR-19b-mediated PTEN down-regulation is sufficient to influence TH17 differentiation. With a low dose of the selective inhibitor PIK-75, we specifically blocked the activity of p110α subunit of PI3 kinase to assess the contribution of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway for TH17 differentiation in miR-17-92 KO CD4+ T cells (30.Knight Z.A.

We demonstrated endothelial dysfunction with vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients; however the impact of cholecalciferol supplementation on vascular stiffness and vasomotor function, endothelial and bone biomarkers in CKD patients with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] is unknown, which this study investigated. Methods We assessed non-diabetic patients with CKD stage 3/4, age 17–80 years and serum 25(OH)D <75 nmol/L. Brachial artery Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD), Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV), Augmentation Index (AI) and circulating blood biomarkers were evaluated at baseline and at 16 weeks. Oral 300,000 units cholecalciferol was administered at baseline and 8-weeks. Results Clinical characteristics of 26 patients were: age 50±14 (mean±1SD) years, eGFR 41±11 ml/min/1.73 m2, males 73%, dyslipidaemia 36%, smokers 23% and hypertensives 87%. At 16-week serum 25(OH)D and calcium increased (43±16 to 84±29 nmol/L, p<0.001 and 2.37±0.09 to 2.42±0.09 mmol/L; p = 0.004, respectively) and parathyroid hormone decreased (10.8±8.6 to 7.4±4.4; p = 0.001). FMD improved from 3.1±3.3% to 6.1±3.7%, p = 0.001. Endothelial biomarker concentrations decreased: E-Selectin from 5666±2123 to 5256±2058 pg/mL; p = 0.032, ICAM-1, 3.45±0.01 to 3.10±1.04 ng/mL; p = 0.038 and VCAM-1, 54±33 to 42±33 ng/mL; p = 0.006. eGFR, BP, PWV, AI, hsCRP, von Willebrand factor and Fibroblast Growth Factor-23, remained unchanged.

https://openalex.org/W1991975449,"Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are customizable fusion proteins able to cleave virtually any genomic DNA sequence of choice, and thereby to generate site-directed genetic modifications in a wide range of cells and organisms. In the present study, we expressed TALENs in pollen-derived, regenerable cells to establish the generation of instantly true-breeding mutant plants. A gfp-specific TALEN pair was expressed via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in embryogenic pollen of transgenic barley harboring a functional copy of gfp. Thanks to the haploid nature of the target cells, knock-out mutations were readily detected, and homozygous primary mutant plants obtained following genome duplication. In all, 22% of the TALEN transgenics proved knocked out with respect to gfp, and the loss of function could be ascribed to the deletions of between four and 36 nucleotides in length. The altered gfp alleles were transmitted normally through meiosis, and the knock-out phenotype was consistently shown by the offspring of two independent mutants. Thus, here we describe the efficient production of TALEN-mediated gene knock-outs in barley that are instantaneously homozygous and non-chimeric in regard to the site-directed mutations induced. This TALEN approach has broad applicability for both elucidating gene function and tailoring the phenotype of barley and other crop species."
https://openalex.org/W2132391718,"Background Decision-makers in organizations providing continuing professional development (CPD) have identified the need for routine assessment of its impact on practice. We sought to develop a theory-based instrument for evaluating the impact of CPD activities on health professionals' clinical behavioral intentions. Methods and Findings Our multipronged study had four phases. 1) We systematically reviewed the literature for instruments that used socio-cognitive theories to assess healthcare professionals' clinically-oriented behavioral intentions and/or behaviors; we extracted items relating to the theoretical constructs of an integrated model of healthcare professionals' behaviors and removed duplicates. 2) A committee of researchers and CPD decision-makers selected a pool of items relevant to CPD. 3) An international group of experts (n = 70) reached consensus on the most relevant items using electronic Delphi surveys. 4) We created a preliminary instrument with the items found most relevant and assessed its factorial validity, internal consistency and reliability (weighted kappa) over a two-week period among 138 physicians attending a CPD activity. Out of 72 potentially relevant instruments, 47 were analyzed. Of the 1218 items extracted from these, 16% were discarded as improperly phrased and 70% discarded as duplicates. Mapping the remaining items onto the constructs of the integrated model of healthcare professionals' behaviors yielded a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 275 items per construct. The partnership committee retained 61 items covering all seven constructs. Two iterations of the Delphi process produced consensus on a provisional 40-item questionnaire. Exploratory factorial analysis following test-retest resulted in a 12-item questionnaire. Cronbach's coefficients for the constructs varied from 0.77 to 0.85. Conclusion A 12-item theory-based instrument for assessing the impact of CPD activities on health professionals' clinical behavioral intentions showed adequate validity and reliability. Further studies could assess its responsiveness to behavior change following CPD activities and its capacity to predict health professionals' clinical performance."
https://openalex.org/W1966748794,"Endocannabinoids modulate multiple behaviors, including learning and memory. We show that the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) can alter neuronal cell function both through its established role in activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor CB1, and by serving as a precursor for a potent agonist of the nuclear receptor PPARβ/δ, in turn up-regulating multiple cognition-associated genes. We show further that the fatty acid-binding protein FABP5 controls both of these functions in vivo. FABP5 both promotes the hydrolysis of AEA into arachidonic acid and thus reduces brain endocannabinoid levels, and directly shuttles arachidonic acid to the nucleus where it delivers it to PPARβ/δ, enabling its activation. In accordance, ablation of FABP5 in mice results in excess accumulation of AEA, abolishes PPARβ/δ activation in the brain, and markedly impairs hippocampus-based learning and memory. The data indicate that, by controlling anandamide disposition and activities, FABP5 plays a key role in regulating hippocampal cognitive function."

GP recruitment was stratified by self-declared homeopathic prescribing preferences. Adults and children with confirmed URTI were asked to participate in a standardized telephone interview at inclusion, one-, three- and twelve-month follow up. Study outcomes included medication consumption, URTI symptoms' resolution and potentially-associated infections (sinusitis or otitis media/externa) as reported by patients. Analyses included calibration to account for non-respondents and groups were compared using multivate analyses adjusting for baseline differences with a propensity score.518 adults and children with URTI (79.3% rhinopharyngitis) were included (36.9% response rate comparable between groups). As opposed to GP-CM patients, patients in the GP-Ho group showed significantly lower consumption of antibiotics (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27-0.68) and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.38-0.76) with similar evolution in related symptoms (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.64-2.10). An excess of potentially-associated infections (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 0.90-3.20) was observed in the GP-Ho group (not statistically significant). No difference was found between GP-CM and GP-Mx patients.Patients who chose to consult GPs certified in homeopathy used less antibiotics and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs for URTI than those seen by GPs prescribing conventional medications. No difference was observed in patients consulting GPs within mixed-practice. A non-statistically significant excess was estimated through modelling for associated infections in the GP-Ho group and needs to be further studied."
https://openalex.org/W2167946619,"WHO recommendations for dengue diagnosis require laboratory facilities. Antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have performed poorly, and clinical diagnosis remains the mainstay in dengue-endemic countries. We evaluated a combination antigen-antibody RDT for point-of-care testing in a high-prevalence setting. In this prospective cohort study, adults were enrolled from a tertiary infectious disease centre for evaluation of undifferentiated febrile illness from October 2011 to May 2012. SD Bioline Dengue Duo was evaluated at point-of-care against a WHO-based reference standard of viral isolation, RT-PCR, NS1-, IgM-, and IgG-ELISA. 246 adults were enrolled (median age 34 years, range 18–69), of which 197 could be confirmed definitively as either dengue or non-dengue. DENV-2 was the predominant serotype (79.5%) and the ratio of primary to secondary cases was 1∶1.1. There were no test failures and minimal interobserver variation with a Fleiss’ kappa of 0.983 (95% CI 0.827–1.00). Overall sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% (95% CI 88.8–96.8%) and 92.0% (95% CI 81.2–96.9%) respectively. Using WHO clinical criteria alone for diagnosis had similar sensitivities (95.9%, 95% CI 91.4–98.1%) and lower specificities (20.0%, 95% CI 11.2–33.0%). No significant difference in performance was found when testing early versus late presenters, primary versus secondary cases, or DENV-1 versus DENV-2 infections. The use of a combination RDT fulfills WHO ASSURED criteria for point-of-care testing and can enhance dengue diagnosis in an endemic setting. This has the potential to markedly improve clinical management of dengue in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2115161427,"Objectives Accurate, objective measurement is important for understanding adolescents' physical activity (PA) behaviour. When using accelerometry to objectively measure PA, a decision must be made regarding how frequently data is recorded (i.e., epoch length). The purpose of this study was to examine i) PA bout length, and ii) the effect of variations in accelerometer epoch length on PA estimates during physical education (PE) and leisure time in adolescent boys. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Year 9 boys (N = 133; mean age ±SD = 14.36±0.48 years) wore accelerometers during two PE lessons, and for a period of seven consecutive days. Data were reintegrated from 1s into longer periods of 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 seconds. ANOVAs were used to test for differences in PA estimates between epochs in leisure time and PE. Results The mean length of vigorous PA (VPA) bouts was 3.5±2.0 seconds for PE and 2.5±1.7 seconds for leisure time, and mean length of moderate PA (MPA) bouts was 2.3±0.5 seconds for PE and 2.9±0.5 seconds for leisure time. During PE, estimates of MVPA, MPA, and light PA (LPA) increased as epoch increased from 1 second to 60 seconds, while VPA and sedentary behaviour estimates decreased. During leisure time, estimates of all PA intensities decreased as epoch increased from 1 second to 60 seconds, with the exception of sedentary behaviour, which increased as epoch length increased. Conclusion The context in which PA occurs can influence PA bout length measurement and the effect of variations in epoch length on PA estimates. Researchers measuring PA with accelerometry should be conscious of the possible influence of context on PA estimates."

Relationships with body fat compartments, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were studied in the Tübingen Lifestyle Intervention Program (TULIP; N = 358).Circulating adiponectin and fetuin-A, independently of several confounders and of each other, associated with risk of diabetes in EPIC-Potsdam (RR for 1 SD: adiponectin: 0.45 [95% CI 0.37-0.54], fetuin-A: 1.18 [1.05-1.32]) and the NHS (0.51 [0.42-0.62], 1.35 [1.16-1.58]). Obesity measures considerably attenuated the association of adiponectin, but not of fetuin-A. Subjects with low adiponectin and concomitantly high fetuin-A had the highest risk. Whereas both proteins were independently (both p<1.8×10(-7)) associated with insulin sensitivity, circulating fetuin-A (r = -0.37, p = 0.0004), but not adiponectin, associated with insulin secretion in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.We provide novel information that adiponectin and fetuin-A independently of each other associate with the diabetes risk. Furthermore, we suggest that they are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes via different mechanisms, possibly by mediating effects of their source tissues, expanded adipose tissue and nonalcoholic fatty liver."
https://openalex.org/W1986267285,"Salmon calcitonin (sCT) and human calcitonin (hCT) are pharmacologically distinct. However, the reason for the differences is unclear. Here we analyze the differences between sCT and hCT on the human calcitonin receptor (CT(a)R) with respect to activation of cAMP signaling, β-arrestin recruitment, ligand binding kinetics and internalization. The study was conducted using mammalian cell lines heterologously expressing the human CT(a) receptor. CT(a)R downstream signaling was investigated with dose response profiles for cAMP production and β-arrestin recruitment for sCT and hCT during short term (<2 hours) and prolonged (up to 72 hours) stimulation. CT(a)R kinetics and internalization was investigated with radio-labeled sCT and hCT ligands on cultured cells and isolated membrane preparations from the same cell line. We found that sCT and hCT are equipotent during short-term stimulations with differences manifesting themselves only during long-term stimulation with sCT inducing a prolonged activation up to 72 hours, while hCT loses activity markedly earlier. The prolonged sCT stimulation of both cAMP accumulation and β-arrestin recruitment was attenuated, but not abrogated by acid wash, suggesting a role for sCT activated internalized receptors. We have demonstrated a novel phenomenon, namely that two distinct CT(a)R downstream signaling activation patterns are activated by two related ligands, thereby highlighting qualitatively different signaling responses in vitro that could have implications for sCT use in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2039707738,"Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Of the different lower airway-infiltrating immune cells that participate in asthma, T lymphocytes that produce Th2 cytokines play important roles in pathogenesis. These T cells are mainly fully differentiated CCR7(-) effector memory T (TEM) cells. Targeting TEM cells without affecting CCR7(+) naïve and central memory (TCM) cells has the potential of treating TEM-mediated diseases, such as asthma, without inducing generalized immunosuppression. The voltage-gated KV1.3 potassium channel is a target for preferential inhibition of TEM cells. Here, we investigated the effects of ShK-186, a selective KV1.3 channel blocker, for the treatment of asthma. A significant proportion of T lymphocytes in the lower airways of subjects with asthma expressed high levels of KV1.3 channels. ShK-186 inhibited the allergen-induced activation of peripheral blood T cells from those subjects. Immunization of F344 rats against ovalbumin followed by intranasal challenges with ovalbumin induced airway hyper-reactivity, which was reduced by the administration of ShK-186. ShK-186 also reduced total immune infiltrates in the bronchoalveolar lavage and number of infiltrating lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils assessed by differential counts. Rats with the ovalbumin-induced model of asthma had elevated levels of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 measured by ELISA in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. ShK-186 administration reduced levels of IL-4 and IL-5 and induced an increase in the production of IL-10. Finally, ShK-186 inhibited the proliferation of lung-infiltrating ovalbumin-specific T cells.

N-terminal region Reelin repeat very low density lipoprotein receptor a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs. The exact N-t cleavage site is unknown. We reasoned that precise determination of the cleavage site has at least four implications. First, analysis of the primary sequence surrounding the cleavage site may be helpful in identifying the protease(s) mediating N-t cleavage. Second, introducing point mutations at the cleavage site may produce an “uncleavable” Reelin mutant, which would be an indispensable tool for investigating the physiological significance of N-t cleavage. Third, it may be possible to produce antibodies capable of recognizing either the uncleaved or cleaved forms of Reelin. Such antibodies would be necessary to clarify the localization of full-length Reelin or its cleaved fragments in situ. Fourth, comparison of the primary sequence surrounding the cleavage site with other species may reveal whether or not N-t cleavage is evolutionarily conserved, which may shed light on the evolutionary changes in the function of Reelin in the brain. Therefore, we aimed to determine the exact site of N-t cleavage and found that it occurs within RR3 between Pro-1244 and Ala-1245. We then produced an uncleavable Reelin mutant and a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes uncleaved Reelin protein. Analyses using these tools clearly showed that N-t cleavage plays important roles in regulating the duration and range of Reelin signaling. Most importantly, N-t cleavage is a prerequisite for the clearance of internalized Reelin from the endosome, which is required for halting the Dab1-phosphorylating machinery. The following antibodies were purchased: anti-Reelin G10 and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 from Millipore, anti-Reelin AF3820 from R&D Systems, anti-Myc (clone 9E10) and anti-β-actin (clone AC-15) from Sigma, and anti-Rab11 antiserum from Abcam.

Briefly, 24- or 12-well polystyrene dishes or glass coverslips were coated with 0.005% poly-l-lysine overnight and subsequently washed with water. Cerebral cortices were removed from embryonic day 15 mice, incubated with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) and 0.1% DNase I (Roche), and triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen). For preparation of reeler cortical neurons, reeler heterozygous male and female mice were mated, and, 14–16 days after the first mating day, the female mouse was sacrificed for removal of the embryos. Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (46.Truett G.E. Heeger P. Mynatt R.L. Truett A.A. Walker J.A. Warman M.L.

A small section of the tail of each embryo was removed and boiled in 40 mm NaOH/1 mm EDTA for 30 min and subsequently neutralized with an equal amount of 50 mm Tris (pH 4.5). An aliquot (1 μl) of this solution was used as a template for a PCR (33 cycles of 96 °C for 15 s, 57 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s) using the primers AGAATAAATCATACGTTCATTGGTG and CGTGAAGACATTTACTTATGTCAG. The embryos were maintained at 4 °C until their genotypes were determined. NR3-MycHis protein (18 μg) was incubated with the N-t protease that had been partially purified from the culture supernatant of primary cultured cortical neurons for 24 h. The reaction mixture was applied to a nickel-agarose column chromatography setup in an ÄKTA purification system (GE Healthcare), and the cleaved product was purified according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The purified fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the bands of cleaved product were excised. The primary sequence of N terminus was determined using automatic Edman sequencing with a Procise 494 HT protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). The amount of Dab1 and its phosphorylation state were measured as described previously (29.Nakano Y. Kohno T. Hibi T. Kohno S. Baba A. Mikoshiba K. Nakajima K. Hattori M.

After culturing for 4 days, cortical neurons were incubated with Reelin-containing medium for various durations and subsequently lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Dab1 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Western blotting with anti-β-actin antibody was performed as a loading control. A synthesized peptide (YEKPAFDYC, the cysteine residue was for conjugation) was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, dissolved in water (0.8 mg/ml), mixed with an equal amount of Freund adjuvant (Sigma), and emulsified using a sonicator (Branson). A female reeler mouse was immunized intraperitoneally with the antigen twice with a 2-week interval. The spleen was removed after 2 weeks of final immunization, and lymphocytes were prepared and fused with PAI myeloma cells. The resultant cells were cultured in 96-well plates with GIT medium (Wako, Japan) in the presence of hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine. ELISA and Western blotting were employed to screen for monoclonal antibodies against full-length Reelin protein. Cortical neurons cultured on the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. For staining without membrane permeabilization, cells were incubated with anti-Reelin AF3820 (×1000) and biotinylated cholera toxin B subunit (2 μg/ml) in PBS for 2 h, washed with PBS four times, incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-goat IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) for 1 h, washed with PBS four times, and mounted.

https://openalex.org/W2152107254,"Background High functioning autism is an autism spectrum disorder that is characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as repetitive and restrictive behavior while intelligence and general cognitive functioning are preserved. According to the weak central coherence account, individuals with autism tend to process information detail-focused at the expense of global form. This processing bias might be reflected by deficits in sensorimotor gating, a mechanism that prevents overstimulation during the transformation of sensory input into motor action. Prepulse inhibition is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, which indicates an extensive attenuation of the startle reflex that occurs when a startling pulse is preceded by a weaker stimulus, the prepulse. Methods In the present study, prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle was compared between 17 adults with high functioning autism and 17 sex-, age-, and intelligence-matched controls by means of electromyography. Results Results indicate that participants with high functioning autism exhibited significantly higher startle amplitudes than the control group. However, groups did not differ with regard to PPI or habituation of startle. Discussion These findings challenge the results of two previous studies that reported prepulse inhibition deficits in high-functioning autism and suggest that sensorimotor gating is only impaired in certain subgroups with autism spectrum disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1971575021,"Background The systemic inflammatory response to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is incompletely defined, particularly for patients with severe disease. Methods Analysis of 315 blood samples from 78 inpatients with CDI (cases), 100 inpatients with diarrhea without CDI (inpatient controls), and 137 asymptomatic outpatient controls without CDI was performed. Serum or plasma was obtained from subjects at the time of CDI testing or shortly thereafter. Severe cases had intensive care unit admission, colectomy, or death due to CDI within 30 days after diagnosis. Thirty different circulating inflammatory mediators were quantified using an antibody-linked bead array. Principal component analysis (PCA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and logistic regression were used for analysis. Results Based on MANOVA, cases had a significantly different inflammatory profile from outpatient controls but not from inpatient controls. In logistic regression, only chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) levels were associated with cases vs. inpatient controls. Several mediators were associated with cases vs. outpatient controls, especially hepatocyte growth factor, CCL5, and epithelial growth factor (inversely associated). Eight cases were severe and associated with elevations in IL-8, IL-6, and eotaxin. Conclusions A broad systemic inflammatory response occurs during CDI and severe cases appear to differ from non-severe infections."
https://openalex.org/W1974363838,"Although cannabinoids, such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, have been studied extensively for their psychoactive effects, it has become apparent that certain cannabinoids possess immunomodulatory activity. Endothelial cells (ECs) are centrally involved in the pathogenesis of organ injury in acute inflammatory disorders, such as sepsis, because they express cytokines and chemokines, which facilitate the trafficking of leukocytes to organs, and they modulate vascular barrier function. In this study, we find that primary human ECs from multiple organs express the cannabinoid receptors CB1R, GPR18, and GPR55, as well as the ion channel transient receptor potential cation channel vanilloid type 1. In contrast to leukocytes, CB2R is only minimally expressed in some EC populations. Furthermore, we show that ECs express all of the known endocannabinoid (eCB) metabolic enzymes. Examining a panel of cannabinoids, we demonstrate that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 and the eCB N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA), but neither anandamide nor 2-arachidonoylglycerol, reduce EC inflammatory responses induced by bacterial lipopeptide, LPS, and TNFα. We find that endothelial CB1R/CB2R are necessary for the effects of NADA, but not those of WIN55,212-2. Furthermore, transient receptor potential cation channel vanilloid type 1 appears to counter the anti-inflammatory properties of WIN55,212-2 and NADA, but conversely, in the absence of these cannabinoids, its inhibition exacerbates the inflammatory response in ECs activated with LPS.

https://openalex.org/W2035905798,"The mRNA-binding protein, Musashi, has been shown to regulate translation of select mRNAs and to control cellular identity in both stem cells and cancer cells. Within the mammalian cells, Musashi has traditionally been characterized as a repressor of translation. However, we have demonstrated that Musashi is an activator of translation in progesterone-stimulated oocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis, and recent evidence has revealed Musashi's capability to function as an activator of translation in mammalian systems. The molecular mechanism by which Musashi directs activation of target mRNAs has not been elucidated. Here, we report a specific association of Musashi with the noncanonical poly(A) polymerase germ line development defective-2 (GLD2) and map the association domain to 31 amino acids within the C-terminal domain of Musashi. We show that loss of GLD2 interaction through deletion of the binding domain or treatment with antisense oligonucleotides compromises Musashi function. Additionally, we demonstrate that overexpression of both Musashi and GLD2 significantly enhances Musashi function. Finally, we report a similar co-association also occurs between murine Musashi and GLD2 orthologs, suggesting that coupling of Musashi to the polyadenylation apparatus is a conserved mechanism to promote target mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W2044601342,"The amyloid-β (Aβ) protein is diurnally regulated in both the cerebrospinal fluid and blood in healthy adults; circadian amplitudes decrease with aging and the presence of cerebral Aβ deposits. The cause of the Aβ diurnal pattern is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is diurnally regulated, leading to APP product diurnal patterns. APP in the central nervous system is processed either via the β-pathway (amyloidogenic), generating soluble APP-β (sAPPβ) and Aβ, or the α-pathway (non-amyloidogenic), releasing soluble APP-α (sAPPα). To elucidate the potential contributions of APP to the Aβ diurnal pattern and the balance of the α- and β- pathways in APP processing, we measured APP proteolytic products over 36 hours in human cerebrospinal fluid from cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease participants. We found diurnal patterns in sAPPα, sAPPβ, Aβ40, and Aβ42, which diminish with increased age, that support the hypothesis that APP is diurnally regulated in the human central nervous system and thus results in Aβ diurnal patterns. We also found that the four APP metabolites were positively correlated in all participants without cerebral Aβ deposits. This positive correlation suggests that the α- and β- APP pathways are non-competitive under normal physiologic conditions where APP availability may be the limiting factor that determines sAPPα and sAPPβ production. However, in participants with cerebral Aβ deposits, there was no correlation of Aβ to sAPP metabolites, suggesting that normal physiologic regulation of cerebrospinal fluid Aβ is impaired in the presence of amyloidosis. Lastly, we found that the ratio of sAPPβ to sAPPα was significantly higher in participants with cerebral Aβ deposits versus those without deposits. Therefore, the sAPPβ to sAPPα ratio may be a useful biomarker for cerebral amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2045880562,"Robot learning by imitation requires the detection of a tutor's action demonstration and its relevant parts. Current approaches implicitly assume a unidirectional transfer of knowledge from tutor to learner. The presented work challenges this predominant assumption based on an extensive user study with an autonomously interacting robot. We show that by providing feedback, a robot learner influences the human tutor's movement demonstrations in the process of action learning. We argue that the robot's feedback strongly shapes how tutors signal what is relevant to an action and thus advocate a paradigm shift in robot action learning research toward truly interactive systems learning in and benefiting from interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2044484725,"Objective Immune dysregulation during sepsis is poorly understood, however, lymphocyte apoptosis has been shown to correlate with poor outcomes in septic patients. The inflammasome, a molecular complex which includes caspase-1, is essential to the innate immune response to infection and also important in sepsis induced apoptosis. Our group has recently demonstrated that endotoxin-stimulated monocytes release microvesicles (MVs) containing caspase-1 that are capable of inducing apoptosis. We sought to determine if MVs containing caspase-1 are being released into the blood during human sepsis and induce apoptosis.. Design Single-center cohort study Measurements 50 critically ill patients were screened within 24 hours of admission to the intensive care unit and classified as either a septic or a critically ill control. Circulatory MVs were isolated and analyzed for the presence of caspase-1 and the ability to induce lymphocyte apoptosis. Patients remaining in the ICU for 48 hours had repeated measurement of caspase-1 activity on ICU day 3. Main Results Septic patients had higher microvesicular caspase-1 activity 0.05 (0.04, 0.07) AFU versus 0.0 AFU (0, 0.02) (p<0.001) on day 1 and this persisted on day 3, 0.12 (0.1, 0.2) versus 0.02 (0, 0.1) (p<0.001). MVs isolated from septic patients on day 1 were able to induce apoptosis in healthy donor lymphocytes compared with critically ill control patients (17.8±9.2% versus 4.3±2.6% apoptotic cells, p<0.001) and depletion of MVs greatly diminished this apoptotic signal. Inhibition of caspase-1 or the disruption of MV integrity abolished the ability to induce apoptosis. Conclusion These findings suggest that microvesicular caspase-1 is important in the host response to sepsis, at least in part, via its ability to induce lymphocyte apoptosis. The ability of microvesicles to induce apoptosis requires active caspase-1 and intact microvesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2034851413,"The extant snake fauna has its roots in faunal upheaval occurring across the Paleogene-Neogene transition. On northern continents, this turnover is well established by the late early Miocene. However, this transition is poorly documented on southern landmasses, particularly on continental Africa, where no late Paleogene terrestrial snake assemblages are documented south of the equator. Here we describe a newly discovered snake fauna from the Late Oligocene Nsungwe Formation in the Rukwa Rift Basin of Tanzania. The fauna is small but diverse with eight identifiable morphotypes, comprised of three booids and five colubroids. This fauna includes Rukwanyoka holmani gen. et sp. nov., the oldest boid known from mainland Africa. It also provides the oldest fossil evidence for the African colubroid clade Elapidae. Colubroids dominate the fauna, comprising more than 75% of the recovered material. This is likely tied to local aridification and/or seasonality and mirrors the pattern of overturn in later snake faunas inhabiting the emerging grassland environments of Europe and North America. The early emergence of colubroid dominance in the Rukwa Rift Basin relative to northern continents suggests that the pattern of overturn that resulted in extant faunas happened in a more complex fashion on continental Africa than was previously realized, with African colubroids becoming at least locally important in the late Paleogene, either ahead of or as a consequence of the invasion of colubrids. The early occurrence of elapid snakes in the latest Oligocene of Africa suggests the clade rapidly spread from Asia to Africa, or arose in Africa, before invading Europe."
https://openalex.org/W1992053703,"Na+/H+ exchangers are essential for regulation of intracellular proton and sodium concentrations in all living organisms. We examined and experimentally verified a kinetic model for Na+/H+ exchangers, where a single binding site is alternatively occupied by Na+ or one or two H+ ions. The proposed transport mechanism inherently down-regulates Na+/H+ exchangers at extreme pH, preventing excessive cytoplasmic acidification or alkalinization. As an experimental test system we present the first electrophysiological investigation of an electroneutral Na+/H+ exchanger, NhaP1 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjNhaP1), a close homologue of the medically important eukaryotic NHE Na+/H+ exchangers. The kinetic model describes the experimentally observed substrate dependences of MjNhaP1, and the transport mechanism explains alkaline down-regulation of MjNhaP1. Because this model also accounts for acidic down-regulation of the electrogenic NhaA Na+/H+ exchanger from Escherichia coli (EcNhaA, shown in a previous publication) we conclude that it applies generally to all Na+/H+ exchangers, electrogenic as well as electroneutral, and elegantly explains their pH regulation.

Furthermore, the electrophysiological analysis allows insight into the electrostatic structure of the translocation complex in electroneutral and electrogenic Na+/H+ exchangers. Na+/H+ antiporters are crucial for survival in all organisms because they control the intracellular sodium and proton concentrations (1Brett C.L. Donowitz M. Rao R.

CPA1 transporters couple the transport of n protons to that of n Na+ ions across the membrane and are electroneutral, whereas the CPA2 subfamily includes electrogenic Na+/H+ exchangers, such as NhaA from Escherichia coli (EcNhaA) (1Brett C.L.

NhaP1 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjNhaP1) is currently the only CPA1 exchanger for which structural information is available (3Vinothkumar K.R. Smits S.H.

It is therefore an important prototype for the CPA1 subfamily, which includes the medically important eukaryotic NHEs. cation/proton antiporter family NhaA antiporter from E. coli NhaP1 antiporter from M. jannaschii sodium/hydrogen exchanger solid-supported membrane. There is general agreement that most transporters function according to the alternate access principle (5Jardetzky O. Simple allosteric model for membrane pumps.Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), where the substrate binding sites are alternatively exposed to the cytoplasmic and the extracellular sides of the membrane. However, the structural elements and conformational transitions vary considerably between transporter families (for reviews, see Refs. 6Shi Y. Common folds and transport mechanisms of secondary active transporters.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2013; 42: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7Forrest L.R. Krämer R. Ziegler C. The structural basis of secondary active transport mechanisms.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 167-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The mechanism of an exchanger or antiporter is in principle explained very simply (8Klingenberg M. Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 367-390Google Scholar, 9Stein W.D. Honig B. Models for active transport of cations: steady-state analysis.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1977; 15: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in terms of a flexible membrane-spanning macromolecule with a common binding site for both substrates, known as a transporter. The transporter alternates between a cytoplasmically (inward) and an extracellularly (outward) open conformation if and only if the binding site is occupied. A transition between the two conformations of the empty transporter would create a “leak” that has to be avoided. The condition that forbids a transition of the empty carrier can also be expressed in terms of thermodynamics. The energy barrier between the inward and the outward open forms of the transporter is low when the substrate is bound but high in its absence. This is a well known principle in enzyme catalysis (8Klingenberg M. Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 367-390Google Scholar, 10Klingenberg M. Ligand-protein interaction in biomembrane carriers: the induced transition fit of transport catalysis.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8563-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), where substrate binding lowers the barrier. In a conventional enzyme the barrier applies to substrate conversion. In a transporter the barrier applies to the conversion of (at least two) different conformational states. Indeed, the question of how substrate binding lowers the barrier for the conformational transition is central to an understanding of membrane transport and remains yet to be answered. A striking feature of all Na+/H+ exchangers is their pronounced pH dependence. Specialized protein regions, referred to as “pH sensors” or “proton modifiers” have been suggested to account for the strong pH dependence (2Padan E. Kozachkov L. Herz K. Rimon A. NhaA crystal structure: functional-structural insights.J. Exp. Biol. 2009; 212: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This concept has recently been challenged by the finding that EcNhaA is active at cytoplasmic pH 5 (11Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: an electrophysiological study.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was shown that the substrate dependence of EcNhaA is explained by a simple kinetic model with a single substrate binding site, which is alternatively occupied by one Na+ or two H+ (11Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: an electrophysiological study.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23570-23581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On this basis it was proposed that the pH dependence of Na+/H+ exchangers is a unique property of their transport mechanism. An attractive feature of the model is that Na+/H+ exchangers (Fig. 1A) are inherently down-regulated at alkaline or acidic pH (Fig. 1B) and that there is no intrinsic requirement of any “pH sensing” regions other than the substrate binding site. This mechanism prevents excessive acidification of the cytoplasm in the case of the CPA2 exchanger EcNhaA as well as excessive alkalinization in the case of the CPA1 transporter MjNhaP1. To investigate the pH regulation of CPA1 exchangers we have undertaken an electrophysiological analysis of MjNhaP1. CPA1 Na+/H+ exchangers have so far not been characterized by such methods because their net transport reaction is electroneutral so that steady-state currents cannot be recorded. However, we were able to capture the Na+ translocation step by solid-supported membrane (SSM)-based electrophysiology under conditions where the compensating H+ transport step does not occur. In this way, we tested and verified the previously described kinetic model for Na+/H+ antiporters for a CPA1 antiporter and obtained new insights into the substrate translocation complex and the electrogenic nature of partial reactions in the MjNhaP1 transport cycle. A MjNhaP1 construct containing C-terminal Myc and His tags in the pTrcHis2-Topo vector was used (4Goswami P. Paulino C. Hizlan D. Vonck J. Yildiz O. Kühlbrandt W. Structure of the archaeal Na+/H+ antiporter NhaP1 and functional role of transmembrane helix 1.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) and the following mutagenic primers: MjNhaP1_N160A_s (GTTAGAGGCGGAGAGTATCTTTgcCGACCCATTGGGAATAGTTTC) and MjNhaP1_N160A_as (GAAACTATTCCCAATGGGTCGgcAAAGATACTCTCCGCCTCTAAC). The MjNhaP1 D161A mutant was kindly provided by Prof. Zeilinger (12Hellmer J. Teubner A. Zeilinger C. Conserved arginine and aspartate residues are critical for function of MjNhaP1, a Na+/H+ antiporter of M. jannaschii.FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was obtained using the primers with MjNhaP1_D161A_s (TATTCCCAATGGGgCGTTAAAGATA) and MjNhaP1_D161A_as (TATCTTTAACGcCCCATTGGGAATA). For protein production, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were used. MjNhaP1 WT and mutants were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described previously (4Goswami P. Paulino C. Hizlan D. Vonck J. Yildiz O.

Reconstitution of purified protein was performed essentially as described previously (4Goswami P. Paulino C. Hizlan D. Vonck J. Yildiz O. Kühlbrandt W. Structure of the archaeal Na+/H+ antiporter NhaP1 and functional role of transmembrane helix 1.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) at lipid to protein ratios of 10 or 50 (w/w) and to the indicated lipid concentration. MjNhaP1 proteoliposomes were prepared at lipid to protein ratios of 50 and resuspended in Na+ loading buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) at 15 mg/ml lipid concentration. 10 μl of liposomes was diluted in efflux buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm Tris, 600 mm mannitol, 5 mm MgCl2) titrated to various pH values with Tris or HCl, and mixed using magnetic stirring for 20 s. The suspension was added to a chromatographic column containing 0.5 ml of the strong cation exchange resin Dowex 50WX8 (N-methyl-d-glucamine+) (Dow Chemical Company) and passed through the column using a flow rate of 12 ml/min generated by a HiLoad Pump P-50 (GE Healthcare) to remove sodium that was transported out of the liposomes. Proteoliposomes were eluted by addition of water, and the eluate was diluted to 5 ml. Na+ concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy using an AAnalyst 100 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To verify that determined concentrations corresponded to Na+ concentrations inside the proteoliposomes, proteoliposomes solubilized in 0.05% Triton X-100 were subjected to the same treatment. The Na+ concentrations determined with solubilized proteoliposomes were indicative of the amount of Na+ that could not be removed by the ion exchanger and were subtracted from all measured values. A base level of Na+ at which the efflux of Na+ through MjNhaP1 is considered 0 was taken for the efflux at pH 8. The efflux was considered 100% at outside pH 5, and all measurements were normalized to this value. SSM measurements were performed as described previously (13Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology.Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Bazzone A. Costa W.S. Braner M. Cǎlinescu O. Hatahet L. Fendler K. Introduction to solid supported membrane-based electrophysiology.J. Vis. Exp. 2013; 75: e50230Google Scholar). 27.5 μl of lipid to protein ratios of 10 proteoliposomes (at 3.33 mg/ml lipid concentration) were added to the SSM sensor containing an octadecanethiol/phospholipid hybrid bilayer adsorbed on a gold surface and allowed to incubate for at least 1 h. SSM measurements were performed according to a single solution exchange protocol (nonactivating solution, 0.5 s; activating solution, 0.5 s). Currents were amplified with a current amplifier set to a gain of 109 V/A and a rise time of 10 ms. All measurement solutions for Na+ and Li+ concentration jumps contained 50 mm MES, 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm Tris, 200 mm choline chloride, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and were titrated to the desired pH with Tris or HCl. In addition, nonactivating solutions contained a further 100 mm choline chloride, whereas activating solutions contained x mm NaCl (or LiCl) and (100 − x) mm choline chloride. The measurement solutions for pH jumps all contained 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm choline chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol and were titrated to the desired pH with Tris. Additionally, solutions contained either a further 100 mm choline chloride or 100 mm NaCl. Two methods were used to correct the recorded SSM transient currents for effects due to the interaction of the substrate concentration jumps with the lipid membrane. First, transient currents recorded for the same substrate concentration jumps on empty liposomes were subtracted from the transient currents recorded on MjNhaP1 proteoliposomes. For pH jumps the solution exchange effect was recorded on the same sensor by adding 100 mm Na+ to the activating and nonactivating solutions to block the exchanger in the Na+-bound form. Alternatively, amplitudes of the transient currents for Na+ and Li+ concentration jumps could be corrected directly by subtraction of the amplitudes of the same substrate concentration jump on empty liposomes, yielding results comparable with the subtraction of the current traces. Based on the kinetic model shown in Fig. 1A steady-state and pre-steady-state solutions were determined. An analytical steady-state solution was calculated as described previously (11Mager T. Rimon A. Padan E. Fendler K. Transport mechanism and pH regulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Escherichia coli: an electrophysiological study.J. Biol.

The turnover calculated by this approach was used for the simulations in Fig. 6. For the fit in Fig. 4 a numerical solution was determined by solving the defining differential equations of the kinetic model shown in Fig. 1 using Berkeley Madonna (version 8.3.18; Berkeley Madonna Inc., University of California, Berkeley, CA).FIGURE 4The kinetic model of antiport describes the properties of MjNhaP1.

In the case of the conformational transitions (k1, k2) forward (+) was arbitrarily chosen as the physiological forward transport direction of EcNhaA.

Solution exchange on the surface of the SSM has a time constant of ∼ 5–15 ms (13Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology.Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This affects the time course of the transient current. To take into account the limited speed of solution exchange we used a third-order low pass filter with a time constant of 2.2 ms. This reproduced the transient currents measured on the SSM and corresponds to a time constant of the solution exchange of 6 ms. This yields the measured current I(t). ddtI1=(IT(t)−I1)1τddtI2=(I1−I2)1τddtI(t)=(I2−I(t))1τ(Eq. 5) The substrate binding and release rate constants are chosen in a way to ensure fast (<0.1 ms) relaxation of the binding equilibria. In addition they have to satisfy the relationships defining the preset pK and KD values (x = o or i). pKx=−loghx−hx+KD,xNa=nx−nx+(Eq. 6) A symmetrical kinetic model was chosen throughout this report. k1+=k1−=k1k2+=k2−=k2pKo=pKi=pKKD,oNa=KD,iNa=KDNa(Eq. 7) The displaced charge for MjNhaP1 was set to e1=e2=1.(Eq. 8) This may be obtained using the same system of differential equations by calculating the current at sufficiently large time values. In this case the charge parameters were set to e1=1, e2=0.(Eq. 9) The results of this calculation represent steady-state activity or turnover of the transporter and were used in Fig. 4C. Although the overall transport cycle of MjNhaP1 is electroneutral, the partial reactions of Na+ or H+ translocation (depicted in the insets in Fig. 2, A and B) are electrogenic. We were able to separate the Na+ and H+ translocation reactions by SSM-based electrophysiology and thus to analyze the transport mechanism by monitoring the two partial ion translocation steps of MjNhaP1. Reconstituted MjNhaP1 was activated by fast Na+, Li+, or H+ concentration jumps. MjNhaP1 has been found to be inactive at pH above 7.5 (4Goswami P. Paulino C. Hizlan D. Vonck J. Yildiz O.

Pätzold R. Zeilinger C. Identification of a pH-regulated Na+/H+ antiporter of Methanococcus jannaschii.FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using conditions where the pH was kept at 7.5 on both sides of the membrane, proteoliposomes adsorbed to the SSM gave rise to a fast positive transient current in response to Na+ (ΔNa) or Li+ (ΔLi) concentration jumps (Fig. 2A). To correct for the solution exchange effect due to unspecific interactions between cations and the lipid surface of the SSM (16Garcia-Celma J.J. Hatahet L. Kunz W. Fendler K. Specific anion and cation binding to lipid membranes investigated on a solid supported membrane.Langmuir. 2007; 23: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), control experiments were conducted with empty liposomes. The transient currents obtained with empty liposomes showed a 4–10-fold lower signal, which could be subtracted from the currents measured with proteoliposomes. The resulting protein-dependent currents had high amplitudes ranging between 0.4 and 0.75 nA (Fig. 2A). At saturating substrate concentrations, the amplitudes of the currents recorded for Na+ and Li+ on the same sensor were similar, indicating that the same charge was being displaced in both cases. A transient current was also recorded upon a pH jump (ΔpH) in the absence of sodium using an SSM sensor with adsorbed MjNhaP1 proteoliposomes (Fig. 2B). Because the pH jump effects varied significantly between different sensors, we applied a different correction method. To block the transporter in a Na+-bound form, 100 mm choline+ in both activating and nonactivating solutions was replaced by 100 mm Na+. By this approach the solution exchange effect for the respective pH jump was recorded for each individual sensor. This was then subtracted from the transient currents recorded for pH jumps in the absence of Na+. As observed for Na+ and Li+ concentration jumps (Fig. 2A), a pH jump from pH 7.5 to pH 6.5 resulted in a positive transient current (Fig. 2B). The recorded transients indicated that in MjNhaP1, translocation of H+ is slower than for Na+ or Li+. For a pH jump from pH 9.5 to pH 8.5 (data not shown), identical currents were recorded in the absence or presence of Na+ ions, indicating that no H+ are translocated. This is consistent with a pK of 6.8 as determined in our kinetic analysis (see below), which predicts a fully deprotonated binding site in the pH range from 8.5 to 9.5. The experiments shown in Fig. 2 characterize the partial Na+ and H+ translocation steps as electrogenic, revealing a positive charge displacement. Integration of the corrected currents allowed calculation of the displaced charge and the comparison between the charge displaced in Na+ concentration jumps and pH jumps performed on the same SSM sensor. In an electroneutral transporter, an equal charge is expected to be displaced in the Na+ and H+ translocation steps. However, the displaced charge observed for a pH jump was only 48 ± 14% of the charge displaced in the Na+ jump experiment. We ascribe this to insufficient saturation of the H+ binding site in the pH jump from 7.5 to 6.5. Indeed, a control calculation using the kinetic model for these experimental conditions yielded a similar result of 64%. The pH dependence of MjNhaP1 transport has previously been investigated in everted vesicles by acridine orange dequenching (15Hellmer J. Pätzold R. Zeilinger C. Identification of a pH-regulated Na+/H+ antiporter of Methanococcus jannaschii.FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), an assay that only works above pH 6. To examine transport activity in the pH range 5–8 (as for the SSM experiments), we monitored Na+ efflux by atomic absorption spectroscopy. MjNhaP1 was reconstituted into proteoliposomes containing 300 mm Na+ at pH 8. Transport was initiated by adding proteoliposomes to Na+-free buffer at a defined pH (Figs. 3A and 4C). Note that in the acridine orange assay the pH in everted vesicles was adjusted at the Na+ uptake side (outside), whereas in our experiments the pH remained unchanged at the Na+ uptake side (pH 8 inside), preventing substrate competition for the same binding site. The measured pH profile indicated a plateau of high Na+/H+ exchange activity at pH ≤5.5. Transport decreased with increasing outside pH, with the lowest observed transport activity at pH 8. As pointed out above, the full steady-state turnover cycle of an electroneutral transporter cannot be monitored by electrophysiology. Thus, SSM-based electrophysiological measurements with the electroneutral MjNhaP1 cannot yield a pH profile of steady-state transport activity as shown in Fig. 3A. However, under conditions where the H+ translocation step is slowed down or absent, for example at high pH, the partial electrogenic Na+ or Li+ translocation step can be monitored and analyzed by SSM-based electrophysiology (Fig. 3, B and C). The resulting transient currents recorded upon Na+ or Li+ concentration jumps on the SSM sensor (Fig. 3, B and C) show an inverse pH profile compared with Fig. 3A. Hence, at low pH, where transport activity is high and substrate competition takes effect, transient currents are small, whereas strong currents are recorded at high pH, due to H+ depletion. For the Na+ and Li+ concentration jumps shown in Fig. 3, B and C, currents reached a plateau level at pH ≥7.5. CPA1 antiporters contain an Asn-Asp (ND motif) at the putative binding site, whereas the electrogenic CPA2 transporters have two Asp residues (DD motif) instead. It has been shown that mutation of the aspartates results in complete loss of activity, indicating that they are essential for transport in EcNhaA (2Padan E. Kozachkov L. Herz K. Rimon A.

We confirmed that replacement of Asp-161 in MjNhaP1 with alanine abolished the MjNhaP1-specific transient currents. Following either Na+ or Li+ concentration jumps performed using MjNhaP1 D161A proteoliposomes, the currents recorded were similar in amplitude and shape to those recorded for empty liposomes (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, a similar effect was found following replacement of Asn-160 with alanine (Fig. 3D). Thus, we were able to show that this highly conserved Asn residue found in CPA1 members (4Goswami P. Paulino C. Hizlan D. Vonck J. Yildiz O. Kühlbrandt W. Structure of the archaeal Na+/H+ antiporter NhaP1 and functional role of transmembrane helix 1.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is equally essential for Na+ translocation in MjNhaP1. Note that both investigated mutants correctly assembled into dimers as observed by Western blotting (data not shown). This confirmed that the observed lack of Na+-dependent currents in these mutants is caused by disruption of the substrate binding site and not misfolding of the mutant proteins. Transient currents were recorded for MjNhaP1 proteoliposomes in response to a range of Na+ and Li+ concentration jumps at pH 7.5, where the currents were high (Figs. 4B and Fig. 2, C and D). Peak currents increased rapidly with substrate concentration, indicating a hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten-type response. Apparent affinity values of the cation binding site were determined by a hyperbolic fit of the Na+- and Li+-dependent peak currents (Table 1 and Fig. 2, C and D). The 20-fold increase in affinity for Li+ over Na+ is in line with other Na+/H+ exchangers, which have likewise higher affinity for Li+ than for Na+ (17Lee C. Kang H.J. von Ballmoos C. Newstead S.

https://openalex.org/W2089101931,"Rab31 is a member of the Rab5 subfamily of Rab GTPases. Although localized largely to the trans-Golgi network, it shares common guanine nucleotide exchange factors and effectors with other Rab5 subfamily members that have been implicated in endocytic membrane traffic. We investigated whether Rab31 also has a role in the trafficking of the ligand-bound EGF receptor (EGFR) internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis. We found that loss of Rab31 inhibits, but overexpression enhances, EGFR trafficking to the late endosomes and that the effect of Rab31 silencing could be specifically rescued by overexpression of a silencing-resistant form of Rab31. Rab31 was found to interact with the EGFR by coimmunoprecipitation and affinity pulldown analyses, and the primarily trans-Golgi network-localized Rab31 has increased colocalization with the EGFR in A431 cells 30 min after pulsing with EGF. A glycerol gradient sedimentation assay suggested that Rab31 is sequestered into a high molecular weight complex after stimulation with EGF, as was early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), a factor responsible for endosomal tethering and fusion events. We found that loss of EEA1 reduced the interaction between Rab31 and the EGFR and abrogated the effect of Rab31 overexpression on the trafficking of the EGFR. Likewise, loss of GAPex5, a Rab31 guanine nucleotide exchange factor that has a role in ubiquitination and degradation of the EGFR, reduced the interaction of Rab31 with the EGFR and its effect on EGFR trafficking. Taken together, our results suggest that Rab31 is an important regulator of endocytic trafficking of the EGFR and functions in an EGFR trafficking complex that includes EEA1 and GAPex5."
https://openalex.org/W2025321485,"In daily life, we often need to remember to perform an action after, or at, a specific period of time (e.g., take pizza out of oven in 15 minutes). Surprisingly, little is known about the neural mechanisms that support this form of memory, termed time-based prospective memory (PM). Here we pioneer an fMRI paradigm that enables examination of both sustained and transient processes engaged during time-based PM. Participants were scanned while performing a demanding on-going task (n-back working memory), with and without an additional time-based PM demand. During the PM condition participants could access a hidden clock with a specific button-press response, while in the control condition, pseudo-clocks randomly appeared and were removed via the same response. Analyses tested for sustained activation associated with the PM condition, and also transient activation associated with clock-checks and the PM target response. Contrary to prior findings with event-based PM (i.e., remembering to perform a future action when a specific event occurs), no sustained PM-related activity was observed in anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) or elsewhere in the brain; instead, transient clock-related activity was observed in this region. Critically, the activation was anticipatory, increasing before clock-check responses. Anticipatory activity prior to the PM target response was weaker in aPFC, but strong in pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA; relative to clock-check responses), suggesting a functional double dissociation related to volitional decision-making. Together, the results suggest that aPFC-activity dynamics during time-based PM reflect a distinct transient monitoring process, enabling integration of the PM intention with current temporal information to facilitate scheduling of upcoming PM-related actions."
https://openalex.org/W2051577349,"Tropomodulins (Tmods) are F-actin pointed end capping proteins that interact with tropomyosins (TMs) and cap TM-coated filaments with higher affinity than TM-free filaments. Here, we tested whether differences in recognition of TM or actin isoforms by Tmod1 and Tmod3 contribute to the distinct cellular functions of these Tmods. We found that Tmod3 bound ~5-fold more weakly than Tmod1 to α/βTM, TM5b, and TM5NM1. However, surprisingly, Tmod3 was as effective as Tmod1 at capping pointed ends of skeletal muscle α-actin (αsk-actin) filaments coated with α/βTM, TM5b, or TM5NM1. Tmod3 only capped TM-coated αsk-actin filaments more weakly than Tmod1 in the presence of recombinant αTM2, which is unacetylated at its NH2 terminus, binds F-actin weakly, and has a disabled Tmod-binding site. Moreover, both Tmod1 and Tmod3 were similarly effective at capping pointed ends of platelet β/cytoplasmic γ (γcyto)-actin filaments coated with TM5NM1. In the absence of TMs, both Tmod1 and Tmod3 had similarly weak abilities to nucleate β/γcyto-actin filament assembly, but only Tmod3 could sequester cytoplasmic β- and γcyto-actin (but not αsk-actin) monomers and prevent polymerization under physiological conditions. Thus, differences in TM binding by Tmod1 and Tmod3 do not appear to regulate the abilities of these Tmods to cap TM-αsk-actin or TM-β/γcyto-actin pointed ends and, thus, are unlikely to determine selective co-assembly of Tmod, TM, and actin isoforms in different cell types and cytoskeletal structures. The ability of Tmod3 to sequester β- and γcyto-actin (but not αsk-actin) monomers in the absence of TMs suggests a novel function for Tmod3 in regulating actin remodeling or turnover in cells."

Our laboratory and others have documented that lung fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) exhibit a hypermotile phenotype. This study was undertaken to elucidate the molecular mechanism whereby uPAR ligation with its cognate ligand, urokinase, induces a motile phenotype in human lung fibroblasts. We found that uPAR ligation with the urokinase receptor binding domain (amino-terminal fragment) leads to enhanced migration of fibroblasts on fibronectin in a protease-independent, lipid raft-dependent manner. Ligation of uPAR with the amino-terminal fragment recruited α5β1 integrin and the acylated form of the Src family kinase, Fyn, to lipid rafts. The biological consequences of this translocation were an increase in fibroblast motility and a switch of the integrin-initiated signal pathway for migration away from the lipid raft-independent focal adhesion kinase pathway and toward a lipid raft-dependent caveolin-Fyn-Shc pathway. Furthermore, an integrin homologous peptide as well as an antibody that competes with β1 for uPAR binding have the ability to block this effect. In addition, its relative insensitivity to cholesterol depletion suggests that the interactions of α5β1 integrin and uPAR drive the translocation of α5β1 integrin-acylated Fyn signaling complexes into lipid rafts upon uPAR ligation through protein-protein interactions. This signal switch is a novel pathway leading to the hypermotile phenotype of IPF patient-derived fibroblasts, seen with uPAR ligation.

https://openalex.org/W2020445888,"Rotavirus is the single, most important agent of infantile gastroenteritis in many animal species, including humans. In developing countries, rotavirus infection attributes approximately 500,000 deaths annually. Like other viruses it establishes an intimate and complex interaction with the host cell to counteract the antiviral responses elicited by the cell. Among various pattern recognition receptors (PAMPs) of the host, the cytosolic RNA helicases interact with viral RNA to activate the Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling protein (MAVS), which regulates cellular interferon response. With an aim to identify the role of different PAMPs in rotavirus infected cell, MAVS was found to degrade in a time dependent and strain independent manner. Rotavirus non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) which is a known IFN antagonist, interacted with MAVS and degraded it in a strain independent manner, resulting in a complete loss of RNA sensing machinery in the infected cell. To best of our knowledge, this is the first report on NSP1 functionality where a signaling protein is targeted unanimously in all strains. In addition NSP1 inhibited the formation of detergent resistant MAVS aggregates, thereby averting the antiviral signaling cascade. The present study highlights the multifunctional role of rotavirus NSP1 and reinforces the fact that the virus orchestrates the cellular antiviral response to its own benefit by various back up strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1965686461,"Introduction Blood-stream infection (BSI) is one of the principle determinants of the morbidity and mortality associated with advanced HIV infection, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last 10 years, there has been rapid roll-out of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and cotrimoxazole prophylactic therapy (CPT) in many high HIV prevalence African countries. Methods A prospective cohort of adults with suspected BSI presenting to Queen's Hospital, Malawi was recruited between 2009 and 2010 to describe causes of and outcomes from BSI. Comparison was made with a cohort pre-dating ART roll-out to investigate whether and how ART and CPT have affected BSI. Malawian census and Ministry of Health ART data were used to estimate minimum incidence of BSI in Blantyre district. Results 2,007 patients were recruited, 90% were HIV infected. Since 1997/8, culture-confirmed BSI has fallen from 16% of suspected cases to 10% (p<0.001) and case fatality rate from confirmed BSI has fallen from 40% to 14% (p<0.001). Minimum incidence of BSI was estimated at 0.03/1000 years in HIV uninfected vs. 2.16/1000 years in HIV infected adults. Compared to HIV seronegative patients, the estimated incidence rate-ratio for BSI was 80 (95% CI:46–139) in HIV-infected/untreated adults, 568 (95% CI:302–1069) during the first 3 months of ART and 30 (95% CI:16–59) after 3 months of ART. Conclusions Following ART roll-out, the incidence of BSI has fallen and clinical outcomes have improved markedly. Nonetheless, BSI incidence remains high in the first 3 months of ART despite CPT. Further interventions to reduce BSI-associated mortality in the first 3 months of ART require urgent evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2007936548,"Dynamin 1-3 isoforms are known to be involved in endocytotic processes occurring during synaptic transmission. No data has directly linked dynamins yet with normal animal behavior. Here we show that dynamin pharmacologic inhibition markedly impairs hippocampal-dependent associative memory. Memory loss was associated with changes in synaptic function occurring during repetitive stimulation that is thought to be linked with memory induction. Synaptic fatigue was accentuated by dynamin inhibition. Moreover, dynamin inhibition markedly reduced long-term potentiation, post-tetanic potentiation, and neurotransmitter released during repetitive stimulation. Most importantly, the effect of dynamin inhibition onto memory and synaptic plasticity was due to a specific involvement of the dynamin 1 isoform, as demonstrated through a genetic approach with siRNA against this isoform to temporally block it. Taken together, these findings identify dynamin 1 as a key protein for modulation of memory and release evoked by repetitive activity."
https://openalex.org/W1991234390,"Despite recent advances in molecular classification, surgery, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies, the clinical outcome of patients with malignant brain tumors remains extremely poor. In this study, we have identified the tetraspan protein epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) as a potential target for glioblastoma (GBM) killing. EMP2 had low or undetectable expression in normal brain but was highly expressed in GBM as 95% of patients showed some expression of the protein. In GBM cells, EMP2 enhanced tumor growth in vivo in part by up-regulating αvβ3 integrin surface expression, activating focal adhesion kinase and Src kinases, and promoting cell migration and invasion. Consistent with these findings, EMP2 expression significantly correlated with activated Src kinase in patient samples and promoted tumor cell invasion using intracranial mouse models. As a proof of principle to determine whether EMP2 could serve as a target for therapy, cells were treated using specific anti-EMP2 antibody reagents. These reagents were effective in killing GBM cells in vitro and in reducing tumor load in subcutaneous mouse models. These results support the role of EMP2 in the pathogenesis of GBM and suggest that anti-EMP2 treatment may be a novel therapeutic treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2025439958,"The apolipoprotein (apo) E4 isoform has consistently emerged as a susceptibility factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), although the exact mechanism is not clear. A rare apoE4 mutant, apoE4[L28P] Pittsburgh, burdens carriers with an added risk for late-onset AD and may be a useful tool for gaining insights into the role of apoE4 in disease pathogenesis. Toward this end, we evaluated the effect of the L28P mutation on the structural and functional properties of apoE4. ApoE4[L28P] was found to have significantly perturbed thermodynamic properties, to have reduced helical content, and to expose a larger portion of the hydrophobic surface to the solvent. Furthermore, this mutant is thermodynamically destabilized and more prone to proteolysis. When interacting with lipids, apoE4[L28P] formed populations of lipoprotein particles with structural defects. The structural perturbations brought about by the mutation were accompanied by aberrant functions associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Specifically, apoE4[L28P] promoted the cellular uptake of extracellular amyloid β peptide 42 (Aβ42) by human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells as well as by primary mouse neuronal cells and led to increased formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species that persisted for at least 24 h. Furthermore, lipoprotein particles containing apoE4[L28P] induced intracellular reactive oxygen species formation and reduced SK-N-SH cell viability. Overall, our findings suggest that the L28P mutation leads to significant structural and conformational perturbations in apoE4 and can induce functional defects associated with neuronal Aβ42 accumulation and oxidative stress. We propose that these structural and functional changes underlie the observed added risk for AD development in carriers of apoE4[L28P]."
https://openalex.org/W2062011860,"Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) were not known to live on Tiburón Island, the largest island in the Gulf of California and Mexico, prior to the surprisingly successful introduction of 20 individuals as a conservation measure in 1975. Today, a stable island population of ∼500 sheep supports limited big game hunting and restocking of depleted areas on the Mexican mainland. We discovered fossil dung morphologically similar to that of bighorn sheep in a dung mat deposit from Mojet Cave, in the mountains of Tiburón Island. To determine the origin of this cave deposit we compared pellet shape to fecal pellets of other large mammals, and extracted DNA to sequence mitochondrial DNA fragments at the 12S ribosomal RNA and control regions. The fossil dung was 14C-dated to 1476-1632 calendar years before present and was confirmed as bighorn sheep by morphological and ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis. 12S sequences closely or exactly matched known bighorn sheep sequences; control region sequences exactly matched a haplotype described in desert bighorn sheep populations in southwest Arizona and southern California and showed subtle differentiation from the extant Tiburón population. Native desert bighorn sheep previously colonized this land-bridge island, most likely during the Pleistocene, when lower sea levels connected Tiburón to the mainland. They were extirpated sometime in the last ∼1500 years, probably due to inherent dynamics of isolated populations, prolonged drought, and (or) human overkill. The reintroduced population is vulnerable to similar extinction risks. The discovery presented here refutes conventional wisdom that bighorn sheep are not native to Tiburón Island, and establishes its recent introduction as an example of unintentional rewilding, defined here as the introduction of a species without knowledge that it was once native and has since gone locally extinct."
https://openalex.org/W2053117698,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a potentially lethal disease characterized by inflammation and parenchymal cell death; also, the severity of AP correlates directly with necrosis and inversely with apoptosis. However, mechanisms of regulating cell death in AP remain unclear. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein GRP78 has anti-apoptotic properties, in addition to modulating ER stress responses. This study used RNA interference (RNAi) approach to investigate the potential role of GRP78 in regulating apoptosis during AP. In vitro models of AP were successfully developed by treating AR42J cells with cerulein or cerulein plus lipoplysaccharide (LPS). There was more pancreatic inflammation and less apoptosis with the cerulein plus LPS treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of GRP78 expression markedly promoted apoptosis and reduced necrosis in pancreatic acinar cells. This was accomplished by enhancing the activation of caspases and inhibiting the activity of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), as well as a receptor interacting protein kinase-1(RIPK1), which is a key mediator of necrosis. This attenuated the severity of pancreatic inflammation, especially after cerulein plus LPS treatment. In conclusion, these findings indicate that GRP78 plays an anti-apoptotic role in regulating the cell death response during AP. Therefore, GRP78 is a potential therapeutic target for AP."

Fluorescence quantitative FQ- PCR and western blot results showed that G2/M-phase arrest was correlated with up-regulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21, Chk2 and CyclinB1, whereas the expressions of other G2/M regulatory check-point protein, Cdc2, and feedback loop protein Cdc25C were obviously down-regulated in a p53-independent manner after the SGC-7901 cells were treated with DBDFT (2.5, 5.0, 7.5 µmol·L−1) compared with the control. Furthermore, the up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 as well as the activation of caspase-3 were observed, which indicated that DBDFT treatment triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway with an increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratios, resulting in mitochondrial membrane potential loss and caspase-9 activation in DBDFT treated SGC-7901 cells. In summary, the results illustrated the involvement of multiple signaling pathways targeted by DBDFT in mediating G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells, which suggested that DBDFT might have therapeutic potential against gastric carcinoma as an effective compound."
https://openalex.org/W2040297694,"Introduction There has been insufficient attention to long-term care and treatment for pregnant women diagnosed with HIV. Objective and Methods This prospective cohort study of 100 HIV-positive women recruited within pregnancy-related services in a district hospital in Kenya employed quantitative methods to assess attrition between women testing HIV-positive in pregnancy-related services and accessing long-term HIV care and treatment services. Qualitative methods were used to explore barriers and facilitators to navigating these services. Structured questionnaires were administered to cohort participants at enrolment and 90+ days later. Participants’ medical records were monitored prospectively. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were carried out with a sub-set of 19 participants. Findings Only 53/100 (53%) women registered at an HIV clinic within 90 days of HIV diagnosis, of whom 27/53 (51%) had a CD4 count result in their file. 11/27 (41%) women were eligible for immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART); only 6/11 (55%) started ART during study follow-up. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors associated with registration at the HIV clinic within 90 days of HIV diagnosis were: having cared for someone with HIV (aOR:3.67(95%CI:1.22, 11.09)), not having to pay for transport to the hospital (aOR:2.73(95%CI:1.09, 6.84)), and having received enough information to decide to have an HIV test (aOR:3.61(95%CI:0.83, 15.71)). Qualitative data revealed multiple factors underlying high patient drop-out related to women’s social support networks (e.g. partner’s attitude to HIV status), interactions with health workers (e.g. being given unclear/incorrect HIV-related information) and health services characteristics (e.g. restricted opening hours, long waiting times). Conclusion HIV testing within pregnancy-related services is an important entry point to HIV care and treatment services, but few women successfully completed the steps needed for assessment of their treatment needs within three months of diagnosis. Programmatic recommendations include simplified pathways to care, better-tailored counselling, integration of ART into antenatal services, and facilitation of social support."

Electric field (EF)-induced effects on cellular behaviors have been observed in many cell types. This study was to investigate the effect of physiological direct current EF (dc EF) on cellular responses such as elongation, orientation and motility of trophoblast cells. Immortalized first trimester extravillous trophoblast cells (HTR-8/SVneo) were exposed to the dc EF at physiological magnitude. Cell images were recorded and analyzed by image analyzer. Cell lysates were used to detect protein expression by Western blot. Cultured in the dc EFs the cells showed elongation, orientation and enhanced migration rate compared with non-EF stimulated cells at field strengths of 100 mV/mm to 200 mV/mm. EF exposure increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner and increased expression levels of MMP-2. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK impaired the EF-induced responses including motility and abrogated the elevation of MMP-2 expression. However, the expression levels of integrins like integrin α1, α5, αV and β1 were not affected by EF stimulation. Our results demonstrate the importance of FAK activation in migration/motility of trophobalst cells driven by EFs. In addition, it raises the feasibility of using applied EFs to promote placentation through effects on trophoblast cells."

https://openalex.org/W2039868864,"Objectives Reduced number and impaired function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in patients with chronic kidney disease have been reported. However, there is little data about the association between circulating EPC levels and risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between circulating EPCs and CIN in patients after angiography. Methods and Results A total of 77 consecutive patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) were enrolled. Flow cytometry with quantification of EPC markers (defined as CD34+, CD34+KDR+, and CD34+KDR+CD133+) in peripheral blood samples was used to assess EPC number before the procedure. CIN was defined as an absolute increase ≧0.5 mg/dl or a relative increase ≧25% in the serum creatinine level at 48 hours after the procedure. Eighteen (24%) of the study subjects developed CIN. Circulating EPC levels were significantly lower in patients who developed CIN than in those without CIN (CD34+KDR+, 4.11±2.59 vs. 9.25±6.30 cells/105 events, P<0.001). The incidence of CIN was significantly greater in patients in the lowest EPC tertile (CD34+KDR+; from lowest to highest, 52%, 15%, and 4%, P<0.001). Using univariate logistic regression, circulating EPC number (CD34+KDR+) was a significant negative predictor for development of CIN (odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.54–0.87, P = 0.002). Over a two-year follow-up, patients with CIN had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization of treated vessels, and death (66.7% vs. 25.4%, P = 0.004) than did patients without CIN. Conclusions Decreased EPC level is associated with a greater risk of CIN, which may explain part of the pathophysiology of CIN and the poor prognosis in CIN patients."
https://openalex.org/W2075776964,"Thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) is critical to postnatal pancreatic β-cell maintenance. To investigate the association between TRα and the survival of pancreatic β-cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the expression of endogenous TRα was inhibited by infection with an adenovirus expressing double-stranded short hairpin RNA against TRα (AdshTRα). In control adenovirus-infected pancreatic β-cells, palmitate enhanced the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and heme oxygenase 1, which facilitates adaptation to oxidative ER stress. However, in AdshTRα-infected pancreatic β-cells, palmitate did not induce ATF4-mediated integrated stress response, and oxidative stress-associated apoptotic cell death was significantly enhanced. TRα-deficient mice or wild-type mice (WT) were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, and the effect of oxidative ER stress on pancreatic β-cells was analyzed. HFD-treated TRα-deficient mice had high blood glucose levels and low plasma insulin levels. In HFD-treated TRα-deficient mice, ATF4 was not induced, and apoptosis was enhanced compared with HFD-treated WT mice. Furthermore, the expression level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, an oxidative stress marker, was enhanced in the β-cells of HFD-treated TRα-deficient mice. These results indicate that endogenous TRα plays an important role for the expression of ATF4 and facilitates reduced apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells under ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2120855144,"The atypical chemokine receptor, ACKR2 is a pivotal regulator of chemokine-driven inflammatory responses and works by binding, internalizing, and degrading inflammatory CC-chemokines. ACKR2 displays promiscuity of ligand binding and is capable of interacting with up to 14 different inflammatory CC-chemokines. Despite its prominent biological role, little is known about the structure/function relationship within ACKR2, which regulates ligand binding. Here we demonstrate that a conserved tyrosine motif at the N terminus of ACKR2 is essential for ligand binding, internalization, and scavenging. In addition we demonstrate that sulfation of this motif contributes to ligand internalization. Furthermore, a peptide derived from this region is capable of binding inflammatory chemokines and inhibits their interaction with their cognate signaling receptors. Importantly, the peptide is only active in the sulfated form, further confirming the importance of the sulfated tyrosines for function. Finally, we demonstrate that the bacterial protease, staphopain A, can cleave the N terminus of ACKR2 and suppress its ligand internalization activity. Overall, these results shed new light on the nature of the structural motifs in ACKR2 that are responsible for ligand binding. The study also highlights ACKR2-derived N-terminal peptides as being of potential therapeutic significance."
https://openalex.org/W1987680520,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a known causative agent of diarrhea in children. In the process of colonization of the small intestine, EPEC synthesizes two types of adhesins, the bundle-forming pilus (BFP) and intimin. The BFP pilus is an adhesin associated with the initial stages of adherence of EPEC to epithelial cells, while the outer membrane protein intimin carries out the intimate adherence that takes place at the third stage of infection. BFP is encoded by the bfp operon located in plasmid EAF, present only in typical EPEC isolates, while eae, the gene that encodes intimin is situated in the LEE, a chromosomal pathogenicity island. Transcription of bfp and eae is regulated by the products of the perABC operon, also present in plasmid EAF. Here we show that deletion of relA, that encodes a guanosine penta and tetraphosphate synthetase impairs EPEC adherence to epithelial cells in vitro. In the absence of relA, the transcription of the regulatory operon perABC is reduced, resulting in lower levels of BFP and intimin. Bacterial adherence, BFP and intimin synthesis and perABC expression are restored upon complementation with the wild-type relA allele."
https://openalex.org/W2078934457,"In contrast with the wealth of data involving bHLH and homeodomain transcription factors in retinal cell type determination, the molecular bases underlying neurotransmitter subtype specification is far less understood. Using both gain and loss of function analyses in Xenopus, we investigated the putative implication of the bHLH factor Ascl1 in this process. We found that in addition to its previously characterized proneural function, Ascl1 also contributes to the specification of the GABAergic phenotype. We showed that it is necessary for retinal GABAergic cell genesis and sufficient in overexpression experiments to bias a subset of retinal precursor cells towards a GABAergic fate. We also analysed the relationships between Ascl1 and a set of other bHLH factors using an in vivo ectopic neurogenic assay. We demonstrated that Ascl1 has unique features as a GABAergic inducer and is epistatic over factors endowed with glutamatergic potentialities such as Neurog2, NeuroD1 or Atoh7. This functional specificity is conferred by the basic DNA binding domain of Ascl1 and involves a specific genetic network, distinct from that underlying its previously demonstrated effects on catecholaminergic differentiation. Our data show that GABAergic inducing activity of Ascl1 requires the direct transcriptional regulation of Ptf1a, providing therefore a new piece of the network governing neurotransmitter subtype specification during retinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047297257,"The plasma membrane contains discrete nanometer-sized domains that are resistant to non-ionic detergents, and which are called detergent resistant membrane domains (DRMDs) or lipid rafts. Exposure of host cells to pathogenic bacteria has been shown to induce the re-distribution of specific host proteins between DRMDs and detergent soluble membranes, which leads to the initiation of cell signaling that enable pathogens to access host cells. DRMDs have been shown to play a role in the invasion of Brucella into host macrophages and the formation of replicative phagosomes called Brucella-containing vacuoles (BCVs). In this study we sought to characterize changes to the protein expression profiles in DRMDs and to respective cellular pathways and networks of Mono Mac 6 cells in response to the adherence of rough VTRM1 and smooth 16 M B. melitensis strains. DRMDs were extracted from Mono Mac 6 cells exposed for 2 minutes at 4°C to Brucella (no infection occurs) and from unexposed control cells. Protein expression was determined using the non-gel based quantitative iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) mass spectrometry technique. Using the identified iTRAQ proteins we performed enrichment analyses and probed constructed human biochemical networks for interactions and metabolic reactions. We identified 149 proteins, which either became enriched, depleted or whose amounts did not change in DRMDs upon Brucella exposure. Several of these proteins were distinctly enriched or depleted in DRMDs upon exposure to rough and smooth B. melitensis strains which results in the differential engagement of cellular pathways and networks immediately upon Brucella encounter. For some of the proteins such as myosin 9, small G protein signaling modulator 3, lysine-specific demethylase 5D, erlin-2, and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2, we observed extreme differential depletion or enrichment in DRMDs. The identified proteins and pathways could provide the basis for novel ways of treating or diagnosing Brucellosis."
https://openalex.org/W2061956052,"Epigenetics are thought to play a major role in the carcinogenesis of multiple sporadic colorectal cancers (CRC). Previous studies have suggested concordant DNA hypermethylation between tumor pairs. However, only a few methylation markers have been analyzed. This study was aimed at describing the epigenetic signature of multiple CRC using a genome-scale DNA methylation profiling. We analyzed 12 patients with synchronous CRC and 29 age-, sex-, and tumor location-paired patients with solitary tumors from the EPICOLON II cohort. DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina Infinium HM27 DNA methylation assay. The most significant results were validated by Methylight. Tumors samples were also analyzed for the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP); KRAS and BRAF mutations and mismatch repair deficiency status. Functional annotation clustering was performed. We identified 102 CpG sites that showed significant DNA hypermethylation in multiple tumors with respect to the solitary counterparts (difference in β value ≥0.1). Methylight assays validated the results for 4 selected genes (p = 0.0002). Eight out of 12(66.6%) multiple tumors were classified as CIMP-high, as compared to 5 out of 29(17.2%) solitary tumors (p = 0.004). Interestingly, 76 out of the 102 (74.5%) hypermethylated CpG sites found in multiple tumors were also seen in CIMP-high tumors. Functional analysis of hypermethylated genes found in multiple tumors showed enrichment of genes involved in different tumorigenic functions. In conclusion, multiple CRC are associated with a distinct methylation phenotype, with a close association between tumor multiplicity and CIMP-high. Our results may be important to unravel the underlying mechanism of tumor multiplicity."
https://openalex.org/W2076525254,"Methodological variations in experimental conditions can strongly influence animals' performances in cognitive tests. Specifically, the procedure of the so-called object-choice task has been controversially discussed; here, a human experimenter indicates the location of hidden food by pointing or gazing at one of two or more containers. Whereas dogs usually succeed, results for nonhuman primates are ambiguous. In the standard version of the task the majority of subjects do not respond appropriately to human pointing. However, modifying the task setup, such as placing the containers further apart, seems to improve subjects' performances, suggesting that cue salience may be an important variable. Here we investigated whether the visibility of the experimenter inhibits long-tailed macaques' (Macaca fascicularis) usage of the pointing cue. In our baseline condition, with the experimenter fully visible, the monkeys chose the correct container in 61% of the trials. The performance increased significantly, however, when the experimenter was hidden behind a curtain and only the arm of the experimenter, a doll's arm, or a stick was visible. Furthermore, the monkeys performed significantly better when the tip of the pointing finger or device was close to the target compared to the more distant condition. Intriguingly, after these experiments the monkeys' performance was also significantly improved in the baseline condition (70%). Apparently, the monkeys were first distracted by the presence of the experimenter, but then learned to use the cue. These findings highlight the importance of the test conditions, and question some of the assumptions about species-specific differences in the object-choice task."
https://openalex.org/W1978229208,"The armadillo repeat protein ARVCF is a component of adherens junctions. Similar to related proteins, such as p120-catenin and β-catenin, with known signaling functions, localization studies indicate a cytoplasmic and a nuclear pool of ARVCF. We find that ARVCF interacts with different proteins involved in mRNA-processing: the splicing factor SRSF1 (SF2/ASF), the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5), and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP H2. All three proteins bind to ARVCF in an RNA-independent manner. Furthermore, ARVCF occurs in large RNA-containing complexes that contain both spliced and unspliced mRNAs of housekeeping genes. By domain analysis, we show that interactions occur via the ARVCF C terminus. Overexpression of ARVCF, p68, SRSF1, and hnRNP H2 induces a significant increase in splicing activity of a reporter mRNA. Upon depletion of ARVCF followed by RNA sequence analysis, several alternatively spliced transcripts are significantly changed. Therefore, we conclude that nuclear ARVCF influences splicing of pre-mRNAs. We hypothesize that ARVCF is involved in alternative splicing, generating proteomic diversity, and its deregulation may contribute to diseased states, such as cancer and neurological disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2058028273,"Gene expression profiles have drawn broad attention in deciphering the pathogenesis of human cancers. Cancer-related gene modules could be identified in co-expression networks and be applied to facilitate cancer research and clinical diagnosis. In this paper, a new method was proposed to identify lung cancer-risk modules and evaluate the module-based disease risks of samples. The results showed that thirty one cancer-risk modules were closely related to the lung cancer genes at the functional level and interactional level, indicating that these modules and genes might synergistically lead to the occurrence of lung cancer. Our method was proved to have good robustness by evaluating the disease risk of samples in eight cancer expression profiles (four for lung cancer and four for other cancers), and had better performance than the WGCNA method. This method could provide assistance to the diagnosis and treatment of cancers and a new clue for explaining cancer mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2069861418,"The protein of retroviral origin ENS-1/ERNI plays a major role during neural plate development in chick embryos by controlling the activity of the epigenetic regulator HP1γ, but its function in the earlier developmental stages is still unknown. ENS-1/ERNI promoter activity is down-regulated upon differentiation but the resulting protein expression has never been examined. In this study, we present the results obtained with custom-made antibodies to gain further insights into ENS-1 protein expression in Chicken embryonic stem cells (CES) and during their differentiation. First, we show that ENS-1 controls the activity of HP1γ in CES and we examined the context of its interaction with HP1γ. By combining immunofluorescence and western blot analysis we show that ENS-1 is localized in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, in agreement with its role on gene's promoter activity. During differentiation, ENS-1 decreases in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. More precisely, three distinct forms of the ENS-1 protein co-exist in the nucleus and are differently regulated during differentiation, revealing a new level of control of the protein ENS-1. In silico analysis of the Ens-1 gene copies and the sequence of their corresponding proteins indicate that this pattern is compatible with at least three potential regulation mechanisms, each accounting only partially. The results obtained with the anti-ENS-1 antibodies presented here reveal that the regulation of ENS-1 expression in CES is more complex than expected, providing new tracks to explore the integration of ENS-1 in CES cells regulatory networks."
