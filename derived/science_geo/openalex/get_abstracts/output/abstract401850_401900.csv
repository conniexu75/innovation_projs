https://openalex.org/W2018258390,"Now that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to be perivascular in vivo, the existing traditional view that focuses on the multipotent differentiation capacity of these cells should be expanded to include their equally interesting role as cellular modulators that brings them into a broader therapeutic scenario. We discuss existing evidence that leads us to propose that during local injury, MSCs are released from their perivascular location, become activated, and establish a regenerative microenvironment by secreting bioactive molecules and regulating the local immune response. These trophic and immunomodulatory activities suggest that MSCs may serve as site-regulated ""drugstores"" in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2044339772,"Mechanotransduction is a key determinant of tissue homeostasis and tumor progression. It is driven by intercellular adhesions, cell contractility, and forces generated within the microenvironment and is dependent on extracellular matrix composition, organization, and compliance. We show that caveolin-1 (Cav1) favors cell elongation in three-dimensional cultures and promotes Rho- and force-dependent contraction, matrix alignment, and microenvironment stiffening through regulation of p190RhoGAP. In turn, microenvironment remodeling by Cav1 fibroblasts forces cell elongation. Cav1-deficient mice have disorganized stromal tissue architecture. Stroma associated with human carcinomas and melanoma metastases is enriched in Cav1-expressing carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Cav1 expression in breast CAFs correlates with low survival, and Cav1 depletion in CAFs decreases CAF contractility. Consistently, fibroblast expression of Cav1, through p190RhoGAP regulation, favors directional migration and invasiveness of carcinoma cells in vitro. In vivo, stromal Cav1 remodels peri- and intratumoral microenvironments to facilitate tumor invasion, correlating with increased metastatic potency. Thus, Cav1 modulates tissue responses through force-dependent architectural regulation of the microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2041964741,"Jeremy Reiter and colleagues show that Tctn1 is a component of a transition zone complex that regulates ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition. They also identify a likely causal mutation in TCTN1 in two siblings with Joubert syndrome. Mutations affecting ciliary components cause ciliopathies. As described here, we investigated Tectonic1 (Tctn1), a regulator of mouse Hedgehog signaling, and found that it is essential for ciliogenesis in some, but not all, tissues. Cell types that do not require Tctn1 for ciliogenesis require it to localize select membrane-associated proteins to the cilium, including Arl13b, AC3, Smoothened and Pkd2. Tctn1 forms a complex with multiple ciliopathy proteins associated with Meckel and Joubert syndromes, including Mks1, Tmem216, Tmem67, Cep290, B9d1, Tctn2 and Cc2d2a. Components of this complex co-localize at the transition zone, a region between the basal body and ciliary axoneme. Like Tctn1, loss of Tctn2, Tmem67 or Cc2d2a causes tissue-specific defects in ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition. Consistent with a shared function for complex components, we identified a mutation in TCTN1 that causes Joubert syndrome. Thus, a transition zone complex of Meckel and Joubert syndrome proteins regulates ciliary assembly and trafficking, suggesting that transition zone dysfunction is the cause of these ciliopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2081628067,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs) appear to be highly similar to human embryonic stem cells (HESCs). Using two genetic lineage-tracing systems, we demonstrate the generation of iPSC lines from human pancreatic islet beta cells. These reprogrammed cells acquired markers of pluripotent cells and differentiated into the three embryonic germ layers. However, the beta cell-derived iPSCs (BiPSCs) maintained open chromatin structure at key beta-cell genes, together with a unique DNA methylation signature that distinguishes them from other PSCs. BiPSCs also demonstrated an increased ability to differentiate into insulin-producing cells both in vitro and in vivo, compared with ESCs and isogenic non-beta iPSCs. Our results suggest that the epigenetic memory may predispose BiPSCs to differentiate more readily into insulin producing cells. These findings demonstrate that HiPSC phenotype may be influenced by their cells of origin, and suggest that their skewed differentiation potential may be advantageous for cell replacement therapy."

Identification of T-ICs and their related pathways are therefore priorities for the development of new therapeutic paradigms. We established chemoresistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice in which an enriched T-IC population was capable of tumor initiation and self-renewal. With this model, we found CD24 to be upregulated in residual chemoresistant tumors when compared with bulk tumor upon cisplatin treatment. CD24+ HCC cells were found to be critical for the maintenance, self-renewal, differentiation, and metastasis of tumors and to significantly impact patients' clinical outcome. With a lentiviral-based knockdown approach, CD24 was found to be a functional liver T-IC marker that drives T-IC genesis through STAT3-mediated NANOG regulation.

Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Murray T. Thun M.J. Cancer statistics, 2008.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2008; 58: 71-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9959) Google Scholar). The first-line treatment for HCC is liver transplantation or surgical resection (Carr, 2004Carr B.I. Hepatocellular carcinoma: Current management and future trends.Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: S218-S224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, Kassahun et al., 2006Kassahun W.T. Fangmann J. Harms J. Hauss J. Bartels M. Liver resection and transplantation in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma: A review.Exp. Clin. Transplant. 2006; 4: 549-558PubMed Google Scholar). However, most HCCs are inoperable because patients present at advanced stages. Even after surgical resection, the long-term prognosis of HCC remains unsatisfactory due to high recurrence rates. For HCC patients in advanced stages, chemotherapy via either transarterial chemoembolization or a systemic route is the second-line treatment. Unfortunately, the overall response rate is unsatisfactory due to the highly chemoresistant nature of the tumor and the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents (Aguayo and Patt, 2001Aguayo A.

Further investigation into the mechanism of chemoresistance of HCCs is needed to improve the survival rate. The cancer stem cell hypothesis posits that cancers are maintained in a hierarchical organization of rare “cancer stem cells” (or tumor-initiating cells, T-ICs), which divide rapidly into amplifying cells and differentiated tumor cells (Dalerba et al., 2007Dalerba P. Cho R.W. Clarke M.F. Cancer stem cells: Models and concepts.Annu. Rev. Med. 2007; 58: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Owing to this unique survival mechanism, this rare population of cells is resistant to the current chemotherapies (Al-Hajj, 2007Al-Hajj M. Cancer stem cells and oncology therapeutics.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2007; 19: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This hypothesis also provides an explanation for the failure of current treatment regimes due to the fact that they are largely targeted at eradicating the rapidly proliferating tumor bulk. The existence of T-ICs was first evidenced in acute myeloid leukemia (Lapidot et al., 1994Lapidot T. Sirard C. Vormoor J. Murdoch B. Hoang T. Caceres-Cortes J. Minden M. Paterson B.

Integrative comparative genomic analysis has established molecular similarities between T-ICs and normal tissue stem cells, suggesting a role for liver T-ICs in hepatocarcinogenesis (Marquardt and Thorgeirsson, 2010Marquardt J.U. Thorgeirsson S.S. Stem cells in hepatocarcinogenesis: Evidence from genomic data.Semin. Liver Dis. 2010; 30: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, liver T-ICs have been identified by several cell surface antigens such as CD133 (Ma et al., 2007Ma S. Chan K.W. Hu L. Lee T.K. Wo J.Y. Ng I.O. Zheng B.J. Guan X.Y.

Significance of CD90+ cancer stem cells in human liver cancer.Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), and EpCAM (Yamashita et al., 2009Yamashita T. Ji J. Budhu A. Forgues M. Yang W. Wang H.Y. Jia H. Ye Q. Qin L.X. Wauthier E. et al.EpCAM-positive hepatocellular carcinoma cells are tumor-initiating cells with stem/progenitor cell features.Gastroenterology. 2009; 136: 1012-1024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), and these T-ICs are capable of self-renewal and were found to be resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs (Ma et al., 2008Ma S. Lee T.K. Zheng B.J. Chan K.W. Guan X.Y. CD133+ HCC cancer stem cells confer chemoresistance by preferential expression of the Akt/PKB survival pathway.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Because T-ICs are relatively resistant to chemotherapy, we enriched for liver T-ICs by establishing chemoresistant HCC xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice, mimicking the clinical situation under which HCC patients receive chemotherapy. With this model, we identified CD24, a mucin-like cell surface glycoprotein, to be upregulated in residual chemoresistant tumors upon cisplatin treatment when compared with untreated tumors. To further investigate the role of CD24+ cells in HCC, we isolated these cells from the HCC cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and HLE and HCC clinical samples. Freshly isolated CD24+ cells were found to be more quiescent, with a greater ability to form tumors in NOD/SCID mice, and an ability to self-renew, differentiation, and metastasis. The clinical impact of CD24 was also addressed, and it was found to significantly correlate with aggressive tumor behavior. Knockdown of CD24 by a lentiviral-based shRNA approach suppressed the stem/progenitor cell characteristics, suggesting that CD24 is a functional marker of liver T-ICs. Furthermore, we identified NANOG to be an important downstream effector of CD24-mediated HCC tumorigenicity and self-renewal. cDNA microarray analysis revealed that regulation of NANOG by CD24 was STAT3 dependent. Our findings may provide an attractive therapeutic approach of targeting the CD24 cascade in liver T-ICs to achieve better clinical outcomes for HCC patients. According to the “cancer stem cell” hypothesis, chemotherapy reduces the tumor burden while sparing a T-IC population endowed with drug-resistant properties (Ma et al., 2008Ma S. Lee T.K. Zheng B.J. Chan K.W. Guan X.Y. CD133+ HCC cancer stem cells confer chemoresistance by preferential expression of the Akt/PKB survival pathway.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, Pardal et al., 2003Pardal R. Clarke M.F. Morrison S.J. Applying the principles of stem-cell biology to cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether liver T-ICs are enriched upon chemotherapy, a chemoresistant xenograft model derived from HCC cell lines was established that mimics the heterogeneity observed in patients' tumors. Tumor xenografts derived from PLC/PRF/5 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice. When the tumors reached 4 mm in diameter, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with various doses of cisplatin. Such treatment resulted in variable tumor inhibition among the xenografts (Figure 1A ). The dosage of cisplatin for establishment of chemoresistant tumor was determined experimentally by comparing the tumor response to several different dosages ranging from 1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg. From the dose response curve, 5 mg/kg was chosen as the level at which further increase of cisplatin concentration did not further reduce the tumor size (Figure 1B). To verify whether cisplatin at 5 mg/kg enriched the proportion of T-ICs in the residual chemoresistant tumor, single HCC cells derived from untreated (control group) and chemoresistant residual (chemoresistant group) tumors were isolated. The tumorigenicity of the HCC cells derived from these two groups was compared after serial orthotopic transplantation of 5 × 104 corresponding cells into SCID mice. Because the PLC/PRF/5 cells were labeled with the luciferase gene, the tumorigenicity was evaluated with a xenogen imaging system. Compared with HCC cells from untreated tumor, enhanced tumor-forming and self-renewal abilities were observed in chemoresistant residual HCC cells, indicating successful enrichment for liver T-ICs in this chemoresistant HCC xenograft model derived from PLC/PRF/5 cells (Figure 1C). To further determine which markers are elevated in self-renewing chemoresistant HCC cells, the messenger RNA profiles from tumors derived from the untreated and chemoresistant groups (5 mg/kg) were compared with a cDNA microarray containing 34,000 genes (data not shown). CD24, but not other currently known liver T-IC markers (CD133, CD90, and EpCAM), was found to be upregulated by 2-fold in the chemoresistant group compared to the control group. To validate this observation, we studied the expression of CD24 by qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the tumors. Consistent with the cDNA microarray data, CD24 was found to be upregulated by 3-fold by qPCR (Figure 1D). Similarly, IHC studies also showed that CD24 expression was dramatically higher in the chemoresistant group relative to the control group (Figure 1E). To exclude the possibility of a cell type-specific effect, CD24 expression was further evaluated in the same chemoresistant model with another HCC cell line, Huh-7. By IHC staining, CD24 expression was dramatically higher in the chemoresistant group (see Figure S1 available online). To determine whether CD24 marks more tumorigenic liver cells, we examined its expression by flow cytometry (FACS) analysis in a panel of liver cell lines, including the nontumorigenic immortalized cell line MIHA and the HCC cell lines Huh-7, Hep3B, BEL7402, PLC/PRF/5, HLE, BEL7402, MHCC-97L, MHCC-97H, and MHCC-LM3. Variable expression of CD24 was found in the HCC cell lines with in vivo tumor forming ability. In contrast, the immortalized nontumorigenic cell line MIHA, which is incapable of tumor formation in vivo, showed no CD24 expression (Figure 1F). These results suggest that CD24 expression might play a role in tumor development in vivo. Next, we asked whether CD24 was overexpressed in patient HCC specimens when compared with nontumor counterparts. We performed IHC staining for CD24 on 41 human HCC tissue samples as well as their nontumor counterparts. The percentage of CD24+ cells in the HCC specimens ranged from 0% to 16%, whereas there was no CD24 expression in the nontumor counterparts. Among all HCC specimens, more than 70% (29/41) of the cases showed CD24 expression in less than 2% of cells (Figures 1G and 1H). Thus, CD24 was expressed sporadically in human HCC specimens. T-ICs are believed to possess the stem/progenitor properties of relative quiescence (Friel et al., 2008Friel A.M. Sergent P.A. Patnaude C. Szotek P.P. Oliva E. Scadden D.T. Seiden M.V. Foster R. Rueda B.R. Functional analyses of the cancer stem cell-like properties of human endometrial tumor initiating cells.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), self-renewal (Patrawala et al., 2005Patrawala L. Calhoun T. Schneider-Broussard R. Zhou J. Claypool K. Tang D.G. Side population is enriched in tumorigenic, stem-like cancer cells, whereas ABCG2+ and ABCG2- cancer cells are similarly tumorigenic.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6207-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), and tumorigenicity (Li et al., 2007Li C. Heidt D.G. Dalerba P. Burant C.F. Zhang L. Adsay V. Wicha M. Clarke M.F. Simeone D.M. Identification of pancreatic cancer stem cells.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar) in immunodeficient mice. First, we determined whether CD24+ HCC cells were more tumorigenic than their CD24− counterparts in vivo by tumor-forming assay with CD24+ and CD24− cells purified from PLC/PRF/5 and HLE cell lines. Purified cells were inoculated subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice. A significant difference in tumor incidence was observed between CD24+ and CD24− cells (Figures 2A and 2B ). As few as 500 CD24+ cells were sufficient for consistent tumor development in NOD/SCID mice (Tables S1A and S1B). A key property of stem cells, including T-ICs, is their unique ability to undergo self-renewal (Patrawala et al., 2005Patrawala L. Calhoun T. Schneider-Broussard R. Zhou J. Claypool K. Tang D.G. Side population is enriched in tumorigenic, stem-like cancer cells, whereas ABCG2+ and ABCG2- cancer cells are similarly tumorigenic.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6207-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). One method of evaluating self-renewal capacity is by testing serial passage ability. After xenografts derived from sorted PLC/PRF/5 cells formed, the corresponding tumors were excised from the primary recipients, dissociated into a single-cell suspension, grown in culture for approximately 1 week, resorted into CD24+ and CD24− cells using an antibody specific to human CD24, and then reinjected into secondary mouse recipients. After 3 weeks, all the secondarily xenografted mice injected with CD24+ cells showed tumor formation that reconstituted the phenotypic heterogeneity of the primary xenografts (Figures 2A and 2B), providing direct evidence of the self-renewal ability of the cell population. Consistently, as few as 500 CD24+ cells were sufficient for tumor formation (Table S1C). In addition, all secondary xenografts formed around 3 weeks, a significantly shorter tumor latency period than for the primary xenografts. Normal and neoplastic stem-like cells from epithelial organs can be expanded as sphere-like aggregates in serum-free EGF-bFGF-supplemented medium and undergo serial passage (Liu et al., 2005Liu S. Dontu G. Wicha M.S. Mammary stem cells, self-renewal pathways, and carcinogenesis.Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To obtain further evidence for the self-renewal ability of CD24+ cells, we performed a sphere formation assay. Compared with CD24− cells, significantly larger and more hepatospheres were observed in CD24+ cells isolated from both PLC/PRF/5 and HLE cells (Figure 2C), which supports the greater self-renewal capability of CD24+ HCC cells. It is believed that quiescence is one of the characteristics of stem cells (Friel et al., 2008Friel A.M. Sergent P.A. Patnaude C. Szotek P.P. Oliva E. Scadden D.T. Seiden M.V. Foster R. Rueda B.R. Functional analyses of the cancer stem cell-like properties of human endometrial tumor initiating cells.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To compare the relative quiescence of CD24+ and CD24− cell fractions, cell proliferation rate was measured. Colony formation assay revealed that CD24+ cells derived from PLC/PRF/5 and HLE proliferated at a significantly lower rate than CD24− cells (p < 0.010 and p < 0.001, respectively, t test, Figure 2D). Finally, we addressed whether CD24+ cells had other intrinsic properties of stem cells by examining the expression of certain “stemness”-associated genes that are crucial in pathways and programs that establish and maintain stem cell-like characteristics. With qPCR analysis, we found that CD24+ fractions purified from both PLC/PRF/5 and HLE cells had a general overexpression of these genes (Figure 2E). We have demonstrated that sorted CD24+ cells derived from HCC cell lines possess stem/progenitor characteristics (Figure 2). To examine the role of CD24+ HCC cells in HCC patients, we isolated single HCC cells from fresh HCC clinical samples and separated them into CD24+ and CD24− cell populations. We examined whether CD24+ HCC cells derived from HCC clinical samples also possessed tumorigenicity and self-renewal ability. In colony formation assays, CD24+ HCC cells were able to induce more and larger tumor colonies than their CD24− counterparts (p < 0.001, t test) (Figure 3A ), and this showed that CD24+ HCC cells were more tumorigenic than CD24− cells in vitro. To evaluate the in vivo tumorigenicity, two fresh HCC patient samples were used. By flow cytometry, corresponding CD24+ and CD24− cells were sorted from patient #71 and patient #73, and their CD24 expression was found to be 15% and 2%, respectively. As few as 4000 CD24+ HCC cells are able to develop a tumor in NOD/SCID mice, while there was no tumor formation with CD24− cells after 70 days of tumor inoculation (Figures 3B and 3C). The capacity of CD24+ cells for self-renewal was also evidenced by sphere formation assays and evaluation of stemness genes by quantitative PCR. CD24+ HCC cells preferentially expressed stemness genes and were able to survive in anchorage-independent serum-free EFG-FGF supplemented medium (Figures 3D and 3E). CD24 expression was previously found to be overexpressed in HCC and has prognostic significance (Huang and Hsu, 1995Huang L.R. Hsu H.C. Cloning and expression of CD24 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma: A potential early tumor marker gene correlates with p53 mutation and tumor differentiation.Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4717-4721PubMed Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2009Yang X.R. Xu Y. Yu B. Zhou J. Li J.C. Qiu S.J. Shi Y.H. Wang X.Y. Dai Z. Shi G.M. et al.CD24 is a novel predictor for poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma after surgery.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 5518-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated the potential relationship between CD24 expression and the clinical outcome of HCC patients. We retrospectively analyzed the CD24 expression in 46 HCC patients by quantitative PCR. The cut-off value of T/N > 3 was used to determine CD24 expression in HCC patients. Eighteen (39.1%) of the 46 cases showed more than 3-fold CD24 overexpression in the HCC tumor tissues as compared with the corresponding nontumorous liver tissues, and th ese were considered the high CD24 expression group. The correlation between CD24 overexpression and the clinico-pathologic features is summarized in Table 1. Patients whose tumors had high CD24 expression had a significantly higher risk of tumor recurrence in the first year after surgery (p = 0.002, χ2 test) and higher serum AFP level (p = 0.009, χ2 test). Their tumors more frequently had venous infiltration (p = 0.003, χ2 test) and they presented at advanced tumor stages (p = 0.010, χ2 test). Patients with CD24 overexpression in their tumors had significantly shorter disease-free survival than those with low CD24 expression (p = 0.002, log-rank test) (Figure 3F). Consistently, patients with CD24 overexpression had shorter overall survival, though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.113, log-rank test) (Figure 3F). All in all, CD24 overexpression in HCC correlated with more aggressive tumor behavior and worse clinical outcome.Table 1Clinico-Pathologic Correlation of CD24 Expression in HCC PatientsCD24 OverexpressionClinico-Pathological Variables≤3-fold>3-foldp ValueRecurrence in the First Year (n = 46)No2260.002aSignificant difference., bχ2 test.Yes612Venous Infiltration (n = 43)Absence1930.003aSignificant difference., bχ2 test., cTotal number < 46 due to missing data.Presence912Serum AFP Level (n = 36)Low (≤20 ng/ml)1640.009aSignificant difference., bχ2 test., cTotal number < 46 due to missing data.High (>20 ng/ml)610TNM Stage (n = 43)Early stage (I-II)1520.010aSignificant difference., bχ2 test., cTotal number < 46 due to missing data.Late stage (III-IV)1313Microsatellites (n = 46)Absence23100.051bχ2 test.Presence58Age (n = 46)Young (≤median, 54)13120.179bχ2 test.Old (>median, 54)156Differentiation Status (n = 36)Well differentiated730.456cTotal number < 46 due to missing data., dFisher's exact test.Moderately to poorly differentiated1313Tumor Size (n = 45)Small (≤5 cm)1470.565bχ2 test., cTotal number < 46 due to missing data.Large (>5 cm)1410HBV Association (n = 46)Negative of HBsAg1180.729bχ2 test.Positive of HBsAg1710a Significant difference.b χ2 test.c Total number < 46 due to missing data.d Fisher's exact test.

Predictive factors for intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after partial hepatectomy.Cancer. 1992; 69: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, high CD24 expression significantly correlated with venous infiltration. This finding suggests that CD24+ cells are endowed with metastatic features. To test this hypothesis, we first isolated CD24+ and CD24− cells from PLC/PRF/5 and examined their invasive and migratory abilities by using matrigel invasion and transwell migration assay, respectively. Prior to each experiment, trypan blue assay was performed to show that cell viability of sorted cells from both subpopulations was greater than 90% (data not shown). As compared to CD24− cells, CD24+ cells displayed approximately 3.7-fold and 5-fold higher cell migration and invasion efficiency, respectively (p < 0.001, t test) (Figures 4A and 4B ). To test the in vivo metastatic role of CD24+ cells, an experimental metastasis model was employed in which 1 × 105 CD24+ or CD24− cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice through tail vein injection. After 40 days, the formation of tumor foci in the lungs was evaluated with a xenogen imaging system. Three out of five (60%) mice injected with CD24+ cells showed tumor formation in the lungs, whereas none of the mice injected with CD24− cells showed tumor formation in the lungs (Figures 4C and 4D). In addition, lung metastasis was also observed in NOD/SCID mice after subcutaneous injection of CD24+ derived from patients #71 and #73 (Figure S2A). Histological evidence for the lack of tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice inoculated with CD24− cells is shown in Figure S2B. These data support the hypothesis that CD24+ T-ICs represent a distinct invasive T-IC population that contributes to tumor metastasis. Recent studies have suggested that CD133 and EpCAM are putative T-IC markers for HCC (Ma et al., 2007Ma S. Chan K.W. Hu L. Lee T.K. Wo J.Y. Ng I.O. Zheng B.J. Guan X.Y.

By flow cytometric analysis, we examined and compared the expression of each marker in Huh-7 cells. CD24 expression was found to overlap with that of CD133 and EpCAM, suggesting that these three markers share similar self-renewal pathways (Figure S3A). Contrary to CD133 and EpCAM, we observed only a very low, if at all, overlapping expression between CD24 and CD90 (∼1%) (data not shown). In view of this, we proceeded to examine whether CD24 serves a unique function of liver T-IC over CD90 by using a CD90 lentiviral based shRNA knockdown approach in MHCC97H cells, which was found to contain the highest CD24 expression among a panel of liver cell lines tested (Yang et al., 2008Yang Z.F. Ho D.W. Ng M.N. Lau C.K. Yu W.C. Ngai P. Chu P.W. Lam C.T. Poon R.T. Fan S.T. Significance of CD90+ cancer stem cells in human liver cancer.Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). CD90-repressed clones (shRNA CD90) or CD90-expressing clones (nontarget control) were first sorted for CD24+ and CD24− cells and then examined for differential tumorigenic capacity (Figure S3B). CD24+ liver T-ICs were found to be more tumorigenic than CD24− non-T-ICs. Further, the ability of CD24+ CD90-expressing or knockdown cells to initiate tumor formation were very similar, with a tumor initiation rate of 83.3% and 75%, respectively (Figure S3C). Thus, we concluded that CD24 do serve as a unique function in the T-ICs of HCC. To investigate the differentiation capacity of CD24+ cells, we first cultivated the cells dissociated from fresh HCC clinical tissues in such specified medium as “hepatospheres” to obtain undifferentiated cells. These hepatospheres were serially passaged by trypsinization into single cells to reform new hepatospheres and, after three passages, all the floating hepatospheres were observed to be CD24+ (data not shown), suggesting the inability of CD24− cells to survive in serum-free conditions. To evaluate the differentiation potential of CD24+ cells, hepatospheres were cultivated without EGF or FGF in the presence of 10% serum. After 1 day of culture, floating undifferentiated cells attached to the glass, gradually flattened out from the hepatospheres, and became large and adherent cells. Upon differentiation, the hepatospheres gained CK18 expression and lost CD24 expression, and they acquired a morphology closely resembling the HCC cells present in the original tumor (Figure 4E). By qPCR, we found consistent decline in CD24 and stemness-associated genes upon differentiat"

XCI is regulated by a unique region known as the X-inactivation center (Xic), which sequentially controls the counting of X chromosomes, the random choice of one of two X chromosomes for inactivation, and the initiation and spread of silencing along the chromosome. The Xic resides in a 100 to 500 kb X-linked domain with intriguing noncoding genes (Chureau et al., 2002Chureau C. Prissette M. Bourdet A. Barbe V. Cattolico L. Jones L. Eggen A. Avner P. Duret L.

When dosage compensation is triggered by cell differentiation, Tsix continues to be expressed from the future active X (Xa) but is downregulated on the future inactive X (Xi) to relieve the first roadblock to Xist activation. Suppression of Tsix on Xi enables RepA RNA to recruit Polycomb complexes to Xist (Sun et al., 2006Sun B.K. Deaton A.M. Lee J.T.

Thus, Xist is controlled positively and negatively by several Xic-encoded transcripts that act upon Xist in a requisite allele-specific manner. These findings underscore one major challenge of the mammalian dosage compensation system: Whereas the fruitfly and roundworm dosage compensation machineries act upon all X chromosomes in the nucleus (Park et al., 2003Park Y. Mengus G. Bai X. Kageyama Y. Meller V.H. Becker P.B. Kuroda M.I. Sequence-specific targeting of Drosophila roX genes by the MSL dosage compensation complex.Mol.

Targeting X chromosomes for repression.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2010; 20: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the mammalian machinery must discriminate between two essentially identical X chromosomes. Furthermore, silencing must occur in phase, so that alleles along one X are coordinately inactivated without affecting X-linked alleles in trans. Conceptually, the mammalian paradigm necessitates an initial decision point (“choice”) in which the cell designates one Xa and one Xi, followed by an execution step in which the Xist-Polycomb silencing machinery is recruited to as yet undefined loci along one X. Two broad classes of recruiting mechanisms can be envisioned. One postulates that recruitment is regulated locally—that each X gene or a cluster of genes attracts its own dosage compensation machinery independently of other genes/clusters on the same X. Given strong evidence for the existence of only a single control center (Xic) (Lee et al., 1996Lee J.T. Strauss W.M. Dausman J.A. Jaenisch R. A 450 kb transgene displays properties of the mammalian X-inactivation center.Cell. 1996; 86: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, Chureau et al., 2002Chureau C.

Comparative sequence analysis of the X-inactivation center region in mouse, human, and bovine.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 894-908PubMed Google Scholar) and coordinated spread along Xi, this type of mechanism is not favored. More popular is the idea of a primary recruiting center at which Xist particles would load and propagate in a cis-limited manner with the aid of regularly spaced booster elements (Gartler and Riggs, 1983Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1983; 17: 155-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Because neither recruiting centers nor booster elements have been identified, how Xist binds the X remains elusive. Here, we investigate this problem and discover a developmentally regulated receptor within the Xic that traps the Xist-Polycomb complex. Our model supports the idea of a single nucleation center that loads Xist particles prior to their translocation along Xi. To study Xist RNA localization, we introduced a full-length doxycycline (dox)-inducible Xist transgene (X+P; Figure 1A) into female mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed transgene expression and formation of small Xist foci even without dox induction (Figure 1B), likely due to inclusion of 180 bp of Xist's promoter sequence (Pillet et al., 1995Pillet N. Bonny C. Schorderet D.F. Characterization of the promoter region of the mouse Xist gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Stavropoulos et al., 2005Stavropoulos N. Rowntree R.K. Lee J.T. Identification of developmentally specific enhancers for Tsix in the regulation of X chromosome inactivation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2757-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). (Note: Cells are tetraploid due to SV40 large T-transformation; two Xi are present.) Dox induction for 24 hr significantly boosted expression and led to development of large Xist clouds (Figure 1B). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that total Xist levels were 2–5 times higher than in wild-type (WT) cells before dox induction and increased 2–3 times further upon induction (Figure 1C; exons 1–3). To examine transgenic contributions, we amplified with transgene-specific primers (uXist) and observed >10-fold induction with dox. Two unusual observations caught our attention. First, the transgene not only formed Xist clouds but was also hypermethylated at H3K27 (H3K27me3) (Figure 1B). This was unexpected because previous analyses with a mouse embryonic stem (ES) model showed that the X chromosome becomes refractory to Xist after the first 3 days of cell differentiation (Wutz and Jaenisch, 2000Wutz A. Jaenisch R. A shift from reversible to irreversible X inactivation is triggered during ES cell differentiation.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, Kohlmaier et al., 2004Kohlmaier A. Savarese F. Lachner M. Martens J. Jenuwein T. Wutz A. A chromosomal memory triggered by Xist regulates histone methylation in X inactivation.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E171Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). More surprisingly, ectopic Xist clouds were always more prominent than endogenous clouds. In fact, even before dox induction, the transgene displayed a large Xist cloud and the Xi's RNA cloud was already suppressed in 56%–85% of cells (Figure 1B). After induction, Xist clouds disappeared from Xi completely in 94%–98% of cells (Figure 1B). Multiple independent clones showed this behavior. We conclude that newly introduced Xist transgenes in MEFs act on the endogenous locus in trans and “squelch” Xist RNA clouds on Xi. Several mechanisms could underlie squelching. Introduction of homologous sequences could induce RNAi-mediated gene silencing (Wassenegger et al., 1994Wassenegger M. Heimes S. Riedel L. Sanger H.L. RNA-directed de novo methylation of genomic sequences in plants.Cell. 1994; 76: 567-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the transgene could outcompete endogenous Xist for locus-specific transcription factors (Gill and Ptashne, 1988Gill G. Ptashne M. Negative effect of the transcriptional activator GAL4.Nature. 1988; 334: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Posttranscriptional mechanisms, such as those affecting RNA localization, must also be entertained. To address mechanism, we performed transgene deletional analysis to identify squelching sequences, focusing on Xist's conserved proximal end. We deleted a 2 kb region spanning Xist's P1 and P2 promoters (Johnston et al., 1998Johnston C.M. Nesterova T.B. Formstone E.J. Newall A.E. Duthie S.M. Sheardown S.A. Brockdorff N.

In contrast to X+P clones, multiple independent clones of X-RARF did not squelch endogenous Xist (Figures 1D and 1E). qRT-PCR showed increased X-RARF expression after dox induction (Figure 1F), but RNA FISH revealed no RNA accumulation at the X-RARF site (Figure 1D, arrowhead). These results implied either an RNA localization or stabilization defect in X-RARF. Thus, the deleted 2 kb region is responsible for both squelching and RNA accumulation. To narrow down required regions, we made smaller deletions and examined multiple independent clones of each (representative clones shown in all analyses below). Transgene X deleted only the Xist promoter and squelched effectively (Figures 1A and 1D). The X-RA transgene eliminated the Xist promoter, Repeat A, and RepA RNA (Zhao et al., 2010Zhao J. Ohsumi T.K.

By contrast, transgene X-RF deleted a 700 bp region around Repeat F and abolished both squelching and RNA localization (Figure 1D). Like X-RARF, X-RF induction increased steady-state Xist levels (Figure 1F), but Xist RNA failed to accumulate at the transgene site (Figure 1D, arrowheads). At the same time, Xist clouds on Xi were spared. There is thus a strong correlation between transgenic Xist accumulation and squelching of endogenous Xist RNA. We conclude that Xist's promoter, Repeat A, and RepA RNA are not required for squelching and implicate the 700 bp region around Repeat F in both Xist localization and squelching. We suspected a direct connection between squelching and RNA localization, as squelching occurs when newly introduced transgenes can accumulate Xist RNA. Could the transgene exert trans effects and displace Xist RNA from Xi? Indeed, although Xist clouds faded away on Xi, the stability (or steady-state levels) of endogenous Xist RNA was surprisingly not affected (Figure 1G). To investigate the fate of endogenous Xist RNA, we tracked Xist molecules in squelching-competent X-RA clones. Serial RNA/DNA FISH enabled us to distinguish endogenous versus transgenic RNAs by a Repeat A probe (Figure 2A , RA), and X versus transgenic DNA by a vector-specific probe. Intriguingly, endogenous Xist localized not only to Xi but also to the transgenic site (Figure 2B, arrows). Thus, endogenous Xist RNA transmigrated between Xi and the homologous ectopic site. This behavior was seen even before dox induction, demonstrating that high transgene expression is not required to strip Xist from Xi. H3K27me3 enrichment followed Xist accumulation at the transgene site (Figure 2C). Because X-RA lacks Polycomb-recruiting sequences (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao J. Sun B.K. Erwin J.A. Song J.J. Lee J.T. Polycomb proteins targeted by a short repeat RNA to the mouse X chromosome.Science. 2008; 322: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar), transgenic H3K27me3 must reflect action of transmigrated wild-type Xist-Polycomb complexes. Thus, Xist RNA is diffusible and remains stable when not bound to chromatin. Because earlier experiments in male cells had shown that transgenic Xist could not diffuse between X and autosome (Lee et al., 1996Lee J.T. Strauss W.M. Dausman J.A. Jaenisch R.

A chromosomal memory triggered by Xist regulates histone methylation in X inactivation.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E171Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we examined consequences of introducing our transgenes into male MEFs. Consistent with prior reports, RNA/DNA FISH showed that X-RA male cells formed Xist clouds at the transgene site, but the RNA never transmigrated to X (Figure 2B). Also consistent with previous studies (Plath et al., 2003Plath K. Fang J. Mlynarczyk-Evans S.K. Cao R. Worringer K.A. Wang H. de la Cruz C.C. Otte A.P. Panning B. Zhang Y.

Jenuwein T. Wutz A. A chromosomal memory triggered by Xist regulates histone methylation in X inactivation.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E171Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), the Repeat-A-deficient RNA induced H3K27me3 poorly on the autosome in spite of RNA accumulation (Figure 2C; only H3K27me3 pinpoints at best). However, X+P cells efficiently formed Xist clouds and H3K27me3 foci, further arguing that Xist function is not confined to a developmental time window. Nevertheless, Xist produced from X+P could not bind male Xa. These results demonstrate that, although diffusible, Xist is not promiscuous. The male Xa is resistant to Xist, either because it lacks a receptor for Xist RNA or other accessory factors. To identify the Xist receptor, we designed a “squelching assay,” on the principle that RNA-binding sites on Xi and transgene must compete for a limited pool of Xist particles. First, we asked whether Xist exon 1 was sufficient to attract RNA in trans and tested transgene X+PE1 (Figure 2A) in female MEFs by performing RNA FISH with differentially labeled exon 1 and 7 probes that distinguished endogenous from transgenic transcripts. Indeed, exon 1 attracted endogenous Xist RNA, though not as efficiently as full-length transgenes (Figure 2D, arrows; 22% of cells). As observed in other transgenic lines, Xist RNA remained stable when displaced from Xi in X+PE1 cells (Figure 2E; Figure S1 available online). Therefore, exon 1 is both necessary and sufficient to squelch endogenous Xist. Receptors for Xist must reside therein. We then searched exon 1 for conserved motifs.

To test whether CTCF is required for Xist localization, we knocked down CTCF in female MEF but observed no reduction in Xist levels or clouds (Figure 3B). Thus, CTCF is not needed for Xist binding to Xi. By contrast, knocking down YY1 (Figure 3C) resulted in loss of Xist clouds from >70% of cells (Figure 3D). In cells where Xist was still detectable, RNA signals were pinpoint or severely attenuated (arrows, Figure 3D). Similar results were obtained for two YY1-specific siRNAs, Y1 and Y2, arguing against off-target effects. Transfection with scrambled siRNA (siRNA-Scr) had no effect on YY1 or Xist. Interestingly, although YY1 knockdown affected Xist localization, it did not affect total RNA levels, agreeing with the assertion that Xist RNA remains stable when displaced from chromatin.

Here, we present evidence for a role of human Mediator subunit MED26 in this process.

Mediator subunit MED26 controls expression of genes regulated during elongation MED26 N-terminal domain (NTD) contributes to MED26-dependent gene regulation MED26 NTD recruits ELL- and P-TEFb-containing complexes to Mediator Messenger RNA synthesis begins with recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and other components of the transcription apparatus to the promoter to form a preinitiation complex, followed by ATP-dependent unwinding of the DNA and transcription initiation. Following initiation, Pol II moves away from the promoter, ultimately leading to establishment of a productive elongation complex. Although for many years most research focused on mechanisms that control the preinitiation and initiation stages of transcription, transcription of many genes is also regulated during transcript elongation. Early studies showed that transcription of genes including the human c-myc oncogene, the Drosophila heat shock gene hsp70, and the integrated HIV-1 provirus is regulated by promoter-proximal pausing, in which Pol II initiates transcription but pauses or arrests downstream of the transcription start site (Saunders et al., 2006Saunders A. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Breaking barriers to transcription elongation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Release from the pause is a rate-limiting step that can be regulated by DNA-binding transcription factors or, in the case of HIV transcription, by the viral RNA-binding transactivator Tat. Recently, genome-wide studies demonstrated the presence of promoter-proximally paused Pol II near the 5′ ends of a large fraction of genes, suggesting that regulated promoter-proximal pausing and release are general features of Pol II elongation (Guenther et al., 2007Guenther M.G.

The duration of pausing or arrest during early elongation can be controlled by multiple transcription elongation factors that influence the elongation competence of Pol II. DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF) function together to induce pausing (Wada et al., 1998Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S.

Also implicated in this process are additional transcription elongation factors, including members of the eleven-nineteen lysine-rich in leukemia (ELL) family and their binding partners ELL-associated factors (EAFs) 1 and 2, which together act directly to increase the rate of elongation by Pol II in vitro and regulate expression of hsp70, HIV-1, and other genes in cells (Byun et al., 2009Byun J.S.

Mediator is an evolutionarily conserved coregulatory complex that was first identified in yeast (Kim et al., 1994Kim Y.J. Björklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

Young R.A. An RNA polymerase II holoenzyme responsive to activators.Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In metazoa, Mediator is composed of some 30 distinct subunits (Sato et al., 2004Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A. Jin J. Cai Y.

Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mediator exists in multiple, functionally distinct forms that share a common core of subunits and can be distinguished by the presence or absence of a kinase module composed of CYCLIN C and isoforms of MED12, MED13, and CDK8. Kinase module has been implicated in both transcriptional repression and activation (Taatjes, 2010Taatjes D.J.

In metazoa a subset of Mediator contains an additional subunit, MED26. MED26-containing Mediator copurifies with only a small amount of kinase module, but near-stoichiometric Pol II (Mittler et al., 2001Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M.

The transcriptional cofactor complex CRSP is required for activity of the enhancer-binding protein Sp1.Nature. 1999; 397: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar); however, to our knowledge, the mechanism(s) by which MED26 contributes to this process is not known. Here, we present evidence supporting the model that MED26 functions in part by recruiting ELL/EAF- and P-TEFb-containing complexes, including the SEC, to a subset of human genes. We show that the human Mediator complex can recruit ELL/EAF- and P-TEFb- containing complexes to promoters via a direct interaction with the N-terminal domain (NTD) of MED26. The MED26 NTD also binds TFIID, and TFIID and elongation complexes interact with MED26 through overlapping binding sites. In addition we show the following: (1) in cells wild-type MED26, but not a MED26 mutant that prevents binding of Mediator to elongation factors, regulates transcription of c-myc and other genes; and (2) MED26 knockdown interferes with elongation factor recruitment. We propose that the MED26 NTD may function as a molecular switch that contributes to the transition of Pol II into productive elongation. As part of a MudPIT-based proteomic analysis of the human Mediator complex, we generated human cell lines expressing Mediator subunits with FLAG epitope tags, immunopurified (IPed) FLAG-Mediator subunits and their associated proteins, and identified proteins in anti-FLAG eluates by MudPIT mass spectrometry. In MudPIT datasets the number of spectra corresponding to peptides from a particular protein correlates with the protein's abundance and length. The relative amount of a particular protein in a sample can be estimated from a normalized spectral abundance factor, or NSAF (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang Y. Wen Z. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Refinements to label free proteome quantitation: how to deal with peptides shared by multiple proteins.Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Proteomic analysis previously allowed us to define a complete set of human Mediator subunits (Sato et al., 2004Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A.

Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In-depth analysis of our MudPIT datasets revealed that additional proteins with roles in transcription were consistently enriched in FLAG-MED26 Mediator preparations, relative to Mediator purified through FLAG-MED19 (Figure 1A , and see Table S1 available online) or other core Mediator subunits (data not shown). Among these were initiation factor TFIID and transcription elongation factors including ELL and EAF family members, P-TEFb (CDK9, CYCLIN T1/T2), and MLL translocation partners AFF1, AFF4, AF9, and ENL, all of which are components of the SEC (He et al., 2010He N.

The NSAF values of these proteins were ∼5%–20% of the average NSAF of core Mediator subunits, suggesting that they bind only a fraction of Mediator in solution. TFIID, SEC components, and KIAA0947 and NARG2 could be enriched in FLAG-MED26 Mediator because they bind directly to MED26 or MED26-associated Mediator. Alternatively, because ELL/EAF can interact stably with Pol II in vitro (Banks et al., 2007Banks C.A. Kong S.E. Spahr H. Florens L. Martin-Brown S. Washburn M.P. Conaway J.W. Mushegian A. Conaway R.C. Identification and characterization of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe RNA polymerase II elongation factor with similarity to the metazoan transcription factor ELL.J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and MED26-containing Mediator is enriched in Pol II, some or all of these proteins might be associated with Pol II rather than Mediator or MED26. To begin to address these possibilities, we asked whether the same or distinct MED26 regions are necessary for interaction with Mediator and Pol II and with TFIID, SEC components, and KIAA0947 and NARG2. The most highly conserved region of MED26 is its NTD, which is similar to the NTDs of the elongation factors TFIIS and ELONGIN A and, based on an NMR structure of the TFIIS NTD, can be modeled as a globular domain composed of a four-helix bundle (Booth et al., 2000Booth V. Koth C.M. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Structure of a conserved domain common to the transcription factors TFIIS, elongin A, and CRSP70.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31266-31268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the MED26 C terminus are approximately 10 amino acids that are conserved from insects to mammals, whereas a more extended C-terminal region of ∼100 amino acids is conserved in vertebrates (Bourbon, 2008Bourbon H.M. Comparative genomics supports a deep evolutionary origin for the large, four-module transcriptional mediator complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3993-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We generated human cell lines stably expressing the series of FLAG-MED26 mutants diagrammed in Figure 1B and identified proteins associated with each by MudPIT and western blotting (Figures 1A and 1C). The MED26 C-terminal domain (residues 421–600) is sufficient for its assembly into Mediator and interaction with Pol II. The most highly conserved C-terminal amino acids are critical for these interactions because deletion of the last eight amino acids from the MED26 C terminus disrupted MED26 binding to Mediator and Pol II. Whether MED26 makes direct contacts with Pol II and/or binds Pol II indirectly due to preferential association with a form of Mediator that binds Pol II is unclear; however, we believe that the latter possibility is more likely because we have not detected binding of purified Pol II to free MED26 in vitro (data not shown). Neither ELL nor EAF family members copurified with Pol II bound to Mediator containing MED26 lacking the NTD (Figures 1A and 1C, lanes 9 and 10), suggesting that the ELL/EAF-binding site on Pol II is blocked when Pol II is bound to Mediator. The MED26 NTD does not bind Mediator or Pol II. However, it does copurify with TFIID, P-TEFb subunits, ELL and EAF family members, other SEC components, and NARG2 and KIAA0947 (Figures 1A and 1C, lanes 6–10). Binding of these proteins is specific for the MED26 NTD because they do not copurify with the TFIIS- or ELONGIN A-NTDs (Figure 1D). Thus, the conserved MED26 N- and C-terminal regions are functional domains that support interactions with TFIID and transcription elongation factors and with Mediator and Pol II, respectively. Although we did not detect TFIID in association with MED26 mutants that lack the NTD in our MudPIT analyses, we detected small amounts of TFIID subunit TBP in association with these mutants by western blotting (Figure 1C), perhaps due to interactions between TBP and other Mediator subunits (Cai et al., 2010Cai G. Imasaki T. Yamada K. Cardelli F. Takagi Y. Asturias F.J. Mediator head module structure and functional interactions.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Larivière et al., 2006Larivière L. Geiger S. Hoeppner S. Röther S. Strässer K. Cramer P. Structure and TBP binding of the Mediator head subcomplex Med8-Med18-Med20.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the MED26 C terminus can also bind weakly to TFIID. To define the complexes that interact with MED26, we generated cell lines stably expressing individual FLAG-tagged SEC components, NARG2, full-length KIAA0947, or KIAA0947 deletion mutants. Analysis of proteins copurifying with each protein argues that the MED26 NTD binds at least two types of complexes that share ELL and EAF family members. The first corresponds to the SEC and includes P-TEFb, AFF4 and/or AFF1, and AF9 and/or ENL (Figures 2A and 2B , lane 4), and the second lacks SEC components but includes KIAA0947 and NARG2 (Figures 2A and 2B, lanes 2 and 3). We detect only small amounts of Mediator subunits by MudPIT in FLAG immunoprecipitates (IPs) from cells expressing SEC subunits, most notably FLAG-AFF4 (data not shown), suggesting that only a small fraction of the SEC is stably associated with Mediator. Confirming the interaction of ELL/EAF1 with KIAA0947 and NARG2, recombinant ELL, EAF1, and KIAA0947 specifically co-IPed with FLAG-NARG2 when the four proteins were coexpressed in insect cells. The function of this novel complex will be the subject of a future study. Having observed that ELL and EAF family members are shared by at least two complexes that bind the MED26 NTD, we speculated that members of one or both families might directly interact with the MED26 NTD. As shown in Figure 2D, EAF1 bound the FLAG-MED26 NTD when the two proteins were coexpressed in insect cells in the absence of ELL; EAF2 also bound the MED26 NTD in the absence of ELL (data not shown). In contrast, ELL bound the MED26 NTD only in the presence of an EAF family member. These findings suggest that EAF proteins function as adaptor molecules that link the MED26 NTD to ELL/EAF-containing complexes. Our observation that the MED26 NTD directly binds both TFIID and ELL/EAF-containing complexes suggested that MED26 might contribute to transcriptional regulation at least in part by helping to recruit them to the genes they regulate. Carey and coworkers (Johnson et al., 2002Johnson K.M. Wang J. Smallwood A. Arayata C. Carey M. TFIID and human mediator coactivator complexes assemble cooperatively on promoter DNA.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1852-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) showed that Mediator enhances recruitment of TFIID to a promoter bound by a DNA-binding transactivator, GAL4-VP16. To ask whether the MED26 NTD is responsible for this activity of Mediator, we employed similar immobilized template assays (Figure 3A ), using Mediator complexes purified from cells expressing wild-type FLAG- MED26 or MED26 that lacks the NTD but includes residues 421–600 (MED26 ΔNTD). Both MED26- and MED26 ΔNTD-containing Mediator enhanced GAL4-VP16-dependent binding of TFIID to an immobilized promoter (Figure 3B), arguing that the MED26 NTD is dispensable for TFIID recruitment in this assay and that additional contact(s) between Mediator and TFIID is responsible for this activity. We next tested the ability of Mediator to recruit EAF-containing complexes to promoters in the presence of either GAL4-VP16 or the DNA-binding transactivator HNF4α. As shown in Figures 3C and 3D, the ELL/EAF1 complex or EAF1 alone was recruited to promoters containing GAL4- or HNF4α-responsive elements in the presence of their cognate activator only when binding reactions included wild-type Mediator. However, EAF1 was not recruited to either promoter in binding reactions containing MED26 ΔNTD-Mediator (Figure 3D). To exclude the possibility that free MED26 protein in Mediator preparations is responsible for EAF1 recruitment, we compared the ability of free MED26 and FLAG-MED26-IPed Mediator to recruit EAF1 to an immobilized promoter. Unlike Mediator-associated MED26, free MED26 was not recruited by HNF4α to the immobilized template and, accordingly, did not recruit EAF1 (Figure 3E). Furthermore, excess free MED26 NTD (residues 1–113) competes with Mediator for EAF1 recruitment (Figure 3F). Thus, Mediator can recruit EAF1 or EAF1-associated complexes to immobilized promoters via direct interaction of the MED26 NTD with EAF1. As described above, the MED26 NTD is closely related in sequence to the TFIIS NTD and, based on an NMR structure of the TFIIS NTD, has been modeled as a four-helix bundle (Booth et al., 2000Booth V. Koth C.M. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Structure of a conserved domain common to the transcription factors TFIIS, elongin A, and CRSP70.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31266-31268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To explore whether elongation factors and TFIID bind to distinct or overlapping surfaces of the MED26 NTD, we generated a series of MED26 NTD mutants in which various predicted surface residues were changed to alanine and asked whether we could identify mutations that differentially affect MED26 NTD interactions with ELL/EAF-containing complexes and with TFIID. We observed that a GAL4-MED26 NTD fusion protein acts as a strong activator of a luciferase reporter driven by five GAL4 responsive elements upstream of the AdML promoter in transient transfection assays (Figure S1A ). GAL4-MED26 NTD with alanines in place of predicted surface residues R61 and K62 or K74 and K75 were expressed well but failed to activate the luciferase reporter, whereas GAL4-MED26 NTD D13A was as active as the wild-type GAL4-MED26 NTD. As shown in Figure S1B, GAL4-MED26 NTD and GAL4-MED26 NTD(D13A) could both recruit TFIID"
https://openalex.org/W2073914665,"Wnt proteins are lipid-modified glycoproteins that play a central role in development, adult tissue homeostasis and disease. Secretion of Wnt proteins is mediated by the Wnt-binding protein Wntless (Wls), which transports Wnt from the Golgi network to the cell surface for release. It has recently been shown that recycling of Wls through a retromer-dependent endosome-to-Golgi trafficking pathway is required for efficient Wnt secretion, but the mechanism of this retrograde transport pathway is poorly understood. Here, we report that Wls recycling is mediated through a retromer pathway that is independent of the retromer sorting nexins SNX1-SNX2 and SNX5-SNX6. We have found that the unrelated sorting nexin, SNX3, has an evolutionarily conserved function in Wls recycling and Wnt secretion and show that SNX3 interacts directly with the cargo-selective subcomplex of the retromer to sort Wls into a morphologically distinct retrieval pathway. These results demonstrate that SNX3 is part of an alternative retromer pathway that functionally separates the retrograde transport of Wls from other retromer cargo."

Using an in vitro assay for eukaryotic origin-dependent replication initiation, we investigated the control of these events.

In vitro assays reproduce replication initiation from a defined, eukaryotic origin Cdc7-Dbf4 and S-CDK kinases act sequentially to recruit helicase-activating proteins DNA unwinding is required for lagging but not leading strand polymerase recruitment Origin-dependent initiation does not require topologically defined or nucleosomal DNA Since the identification of the first defined eukaryotic origins of replication in S. cerevisiae cells (Stinchcomb et al., 1979Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Isolation and characterisation of a yeast chromosomal replicator.Nature. 1979; 282: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), a major goal has been to define the molecular mechanisms by which these sequences direct replication initiation. These short (80–120 bp) origins of replication contain an essential, conserved element called the ARS consensus sequence (ACS) that is bound by the eukaryotic initiator, the origin recognition complex (ORC, Bell and Dutta, 2002Bell S.P. Dutta A. DNA replication in eukaryotic cells.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). With the exception of some embryonic tissues, the initiation of replication in metazoan organisms also occurs at reproducible positions; however, no consensus sequence is associated with these sites (Cadoret and Prioleau, 2010Cadoret J.C. Prioleau M.N. Genome-wide approaches to determining origin distribution.Chromosome Res. 2010; 18: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although in vitro assays for the initial helicase loading event at a defined origin exist (Remus and Diffley, 2009Remus D. Diffley J.F. Eukaryotic DNA replication control: lock and load, then fire.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the loaded helicases are inactive and assays for their activation and for origin-dependent replication initiation have not been described. The events of replication initiation are conserved throughout eukaryotes and occur in two temporally separated steps. Helicase loading occurs during G1, when Cdc6 and Cdt1 are recruited by ORC to origin DNA. These factors coordinately load a head-to-head double-hexamer of the Mcm2–7 replicative helicase around the origin DNA (Evrin et al., 2009Evrin C. Clarke P. Zech J. Lurz R. Sun J. Uhle S. Li H. Stillman B. Speck C. A double-hexameric MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto origin DNA during licensing of eukaryotic DNA replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The resulting pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) licenses the associated origin, but Mcm2–7 helicases remain inactive until S phase. Initiation of replication is triggered by the activation of the S phase cyclin-dependent kinase (S-CDK) and Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK) (Labib, 2010Labib K. How do Cdc7 and cyclin-dependent kinases trigger the initiation of chromosome replication in eukaryotic cells?.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These kinases stimulate binding of Cdc45 and GINS to Mcm2–7, resulting in the formation of the Cdc45-Mcm2–7-GINS (CMG) complex and helicase activation (Ilves et al., 2010Ilves I. Petojevic T. Pesavento J.J. Botchan M.R. Activation of the MCM2-7 helicase by association with Cdc45 and GINS proteins.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This event is also referred to as preinitiation complex formation (Sclafani and Holzen, 2007Sclafani R.A. Holzen T.M. Cell cycle regulation of DNA replication.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 237-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae cells, S-CDK must phosphorylate two proteins, Sld2 and Sld3, to promote DNA replication (Tanaka et al., 2007Tanaka S. Umemori T. Hirai K. Muramatsu S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Sld2 and Sld3 initiates DNA replication in budding yeast.Nature. 2007; 445: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, Zegerman and Diffley, 2007Zegerman P. Diffley J.F. Phosphorylation of Sld2 and Sld3 by cyclin-dependent kinases promotes DNA replication in budding yeast.Nature. 2007; 445: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, Sld2 and Sld3 bind the BRCT-repeat protein Dpb11, and the formation of this complex facilitates GINS recruitment (Labib, 2010Labib K. How do Cdc7 and cyclin-dependent kinases trigger the initiation of chromosome replication in eukaryotic cells?.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). S-CDK also stimulates formation of the preloading complex (pre-LC, Muramatsu et al., 2010Muramatsu S. Hirai K. Tak Y.S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. CDK-dependent complex formation between replication proteins Dpb11, Sld2, Pol (epsilon), and GINS in budding yeast.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which is an unstable complex between Sld2, Dpb11, Pol ɛ, and GINS that forms independently of DNA. Mcm4 and Mcm6 are the only essential targets for DDK (Randell et al., 2010Randell J.C. Fan A. Chan C. Francis L.I. Heller R.C. Galani K. Bell S.P.

The Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase promotes S phase by alleviating an inhibitory activity in Mcm4.Nature. 2010; 463: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), although how this phosphorylation facilitates subsequent recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS is unclear. Recent data suggest that DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2–7 removes an inhibitory function of the Mcm4 N terminus (Sheu and Stillman, 2010Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. The Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase promotes S phase by alleviating an inhibitory activity in Mcm4.Nature. 2010; 463: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and that this event is regulated by at least two additional kinases (Randell et al., 2010Randell J.C. Fan A. Chan C. Francis L.I. Heller R.C. Galani K. Bell S.P. Mec1 is one of multiple kinases that prime the Mcm2-7 helicase for phosphorylation by Cdc7.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although their targets are clear, the order of action of S-CDK and DDK has been controversial (Sclafani and Holzen, 2007Sclafani R.A. Holzen T.M. Cell cycle regulation of DNA replication.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 237-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Origin DNA must be unwound to generate the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) template needed for polymerase function. The ssDNA-binding protein RPA associates with origin DNA prior to replication initiation (Tanaka and Nasmyth, 1998Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Association of RPA with chromosomal replication origins requires an Mcm protein, and is regulated by Rad53, and cyclin- and Dbf4-dependent kinases.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5182-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, Walter and Newport, 2000Walter J.

Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). After origin unwinding, Pol α/primase primes DNA synthesis on both strands, whereas Pol ɛ and Pol δ elongate the leading and lagging strands, respectively (Burgers, 2009Burgers P.M. Polymerase dynamics at the eukaryotic DNA replication fork.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4041-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although the Mcm10 protein moves with the replication fork and is required to stabilize the large subunit of DNA polymerase alpha (Pol α, Ricke and Bielinsky, 2004Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mcm10 regulates the stability and chromatin association of DNA polymerase-alpha.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, Zhu et al., 2007Zhu W.

Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase alpha to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2288-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whether Mcm10 is involved in the initial recruitment of Pol α or other DNA polymerases to the replisome is unclear. The order of DNA polymerase origin recruitment and how their assembly depends on DNA unwinding also is uncertain. Using a combination of purified initiation proteins and S. cerevisiae extracts, we describe assays that recapitulate events at replication origins as the cell cycle proceeds from G1 into S phase. In an S-CDK- and DDK-dependent manner, previously loaded Mcm2–7 helicases recruit multiple proteins required for origin activation. These interactions lead to helicase activation, recruitment of replicative DNA polymerases, and DNA replication initiation and elongation. Analysis of these assays reveals a preferred order of DDK and S-CDK function, and in vivo studies show that DDK is required during G1 for Cdc45 binding at early firing origins. In addition, we find that the recruitment of the leading and lagging strand DNA polymerases show different requirements for Mcm10 and DNA unwinding. A major obstacle to the recapitulation of eukaryotic DNA replication initiation in vitro is the incompatibility of the cell-cycle conditions required for helicase loading (G1) and activation (S). To overcome this hurdle, we simulated the G1 to S phase transition using a combination of S. cerevisiae extracts, similar to the approach used for nucleus- and origin-independent replication using Xenopus egg extracts (Walter et al., 1998Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Regulated chromosomal DNA replication in the absence of a nucleus.Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). First, we used G1-arrested extract supplemented with purified Cdc6 to load the replicative helicase onto immobilized ARS1 origin DNA (Bowers et al., 2004Bowers J.L. Randell J.C. Chen S. Bell S.P. ATP hydrolysis by ORC catalyzes reiterative Mcm2-7 assembly at a defined origin of replication.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 967-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Seki and Diffley, 2000Seki T. Diffley J.F. Stepwise assembly of initiation proteins at budding yeast replication origins in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 14115-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The loaded Mcm2–7 complexes were isolated from the G1 extract and activated by incubation with an S phase extract (Figure 1A ). S phase extracts were prepared from cells modified in two ways to enhance their replication capacity. First, these cells contained a temperature-sensitive allele in the DDK catalytic subunit Cdc7 and were arrested at the nonpermissive temperature before extract preparation. Thus, the arrested cells are poised for replication initiation with unreplicated DNA but elevated S-CDK levels. To compensate for a lack of DDK activity, we treated loaded Mcm2–7 with purified DDK prior to addition of S phase extract. Second, these cells overproduced Sld2, Sld3, Dpb11, and Cdc45, which are normally expressed at low levels (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). Thus, after origin loading in the G1 extract, the Mcm2–7 helicase is exposed to both essential replication-activating kinases and an extract containing a robust source of the proteins required for origin activation. After sequential treatment of the loaded Mcm2–7 with DDK and S phase extracts, we observed origin association of the helicase activators Cdc45 and Psf2 (a GINS subunit) as well as Mcm10 (Figure 1B). These associations were dependent on the addition of S phase extract (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 2), an intact origin sequence (A-B2-, lane 3), and prior Mcm2–7 loading (-Cdc6, lane 4). If the temperature-arrested S phase extract was replaced with extracts prepared from hydroxyurea (HU) or G1-arrested cells overexpressing Cdc45, Dpb11, Sld2, and Sld3, then Cdc45, GINS, and Mcm10 failed to associate (Figure 1B, lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, providing additional DDK to these extracts restored recruitment of all three proteins to the HU extract and Cdc45 recruitment to the G1 extract. In contrast, a nocodazole-arrested extract overexpressing the same four proteins (Figure 1B, lane 7) showed a similar pattern of protein recruitment with or without added DDK, suggesting that when all factors are present, there is no M phase barrier to replisome assembly. Together, these properties mirrored the hallmarks of origin activation in vivo. We investigated the interdependencies of replication protein recruitment to origin DNA (Figure 2) by immunodepleting individual factors from the S phase extract and assessing the ability of other replication proteins to associate with the origin. In each case, addition of purified forms of the depleted protein (Figure S1 available online) restored replication protein recruitment, indicating that the depleted extracts remained active and that other essential proteins had not been codepleted.Figure S1Purified Proteins Used in This Study, Related to Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 5Show full caption(A–E) Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.(A) Coomassie blue stain of GINS complex purified from yeast strain yRH156, which overexpresses Sld5, Psf1, Psf2-Flag, and Psf3.(B) Coomassie blue stain of proteins purified from the following yeast strains: Sld2-Flag, yRH152 (lane 1); Sld3-Flag, yRH153 (lane 2); Dpb11-Flag, yRH154 (lane 3).(C) Coomassie blue stain of MBP-Mcm10 purified from E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3)(pLysS)(pRH121).(D) Coomassie blue stain of Cdc45-3HA/3Flag purified from yeast strain ySK-Cdc45.(E) Sypro Orange stain of DDK complex purified from yeast strain yLF52, which overexpresses Cdc7-proA and Dbf4-CBP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A–E) Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Analysis of the depleted extracts uncovered distinct requirements for the recruitment of the helicase-activating proteins Cdc45 and GINS (Figure 2). Only Sld3 depletion resulted in a loss of Cdc45 association, although depletion of GINS showed reduced Cdc45 recruitment. In contrast, Cdc45, Sld3, Sld2, and Dpb11 were each required for stable GINS recruitment. Finally, unlike studies of Xenopus Mcm10 (Wohlschlegel et al., 2002Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Xenopus Mcm10 binds to origins of DNA replication after Mcm2-7 and stimulates origin binding of Cdc45.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), Cdc45, Dpb11, and GINS associated with the origin DNA in the absence of Mcm10 (Figure 2). In addition, Mcm10 recruitment was eliminated by depletion of any of the other proteins tested. Given that helicase-activating proteins were recruited to the origin-containing DNA template, we probed the reaction for the completion of later steps in the replication initiation process. An ∼1 kb linear template poorly supported Pol α recruitment and nucleotide incorporation (Figure 3A and data not shown). In contrast, a larger, 5.9 kb ARS1 plasmid robustly supported both activities (Figures 3A and 3B). Reactions containing the plasmid template included 6-fold fewer copies of ARS1 (due to less efficient bead attachment) than reactions with the 1 kb linear template (Figure 3A, compare ORC levels). Nevertheless, the templates showed similar levels of Mcm2–7 loading, and Pol α and replication levels were much higher for the plasmid template. Thus, plasmid DNA was more efficient for helicase loading, polymerase loading, and replication initiation. To exclude the possibility that the observed nucleotide incorporation is the result of nonspecific repair events, we tested for properties expected for genuine replication products. Nucleotide incorporation was dependent on prior pre-RC formation and ATP hydrolysis (Figure 3C, lanes 1–3). Examination of the replication products by native agarose electrophoresis revealed that nucleotide incorporation was associated with a shift in the mobility of the plasmid (Figure 3B), consistent with formation of theta replication intermediates. Replication products synthesized in the presence of BrdUTP migrated at the position expected for heavy:light DNA in a CsCl gradient, indicating that replication was semiconservative (Figure 3G). In addition, no reaction products were detected in the presence of aphidicolin, a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerases (Figure 3C, lane 4), and nucleotide incorporation accumulated for at least 60 min of incubation (Figure 3D). Most importantly, the replication reaction depended on defined origin sequences. DNA templates with an ARS1 origin lacking an ORC binding site (A-B2-) showed dramatically reduced replication (Figure 3C, lanes 5–11). DNA length rather than supercoiling or the circular nature of the plasmid DNA was required for replication. Direct comparison of replication using a 7.6 kb ARS1 plasmid (randomly biotinylated) or a linearized version of the same plasmid (biotinylated at one end) showed that the linear template replicated 2-fold more efficiently than its circular counterpart (Figure 3C, lanes 8–11), due to longer replication products. This finding suggests that the random attachment of the circular DNA to the magnetic bead inhibited replication by impeding replication forks. We determined total nucleotide incorporation and found that ∼3% of the total plasmid DNA is replicated in the assay. Incomplete Mcm2–7 loading and replication elongation appear to be the primary reasons for the low levels of incorporation (see Discussion). To determine whether the overexpression of Cdc45, Dpb11, Sld2, and Sld3 was important for DNA replication, we tested S phase extracts from cells with endogenous protein levels. These extracts failed to either initiate replication or recruit GINS or Mcm10 (Figure 3E, lane 2). By adding purified and active forms of the limiting proteins (see Figure 2) to the S phase extract, we observed that Cdc45, Sld2, and Dpb11 were each limiting for both events (Figures 3E and 3F). Together, these data indicate that this assay accurately recapitulates replication initiation, displaying a dependence on a defined origin, the replicative DNA polymerases and multiple essential replication initiation proteins. We next asked how the DDK and CDK kinases affected replication factor recruitment and replication initiation. We eliminated DDK activity by omitting purified DDK and S-CDK activity by addition of the S-CDK inhibitor Sic1. Both kinases were essential for replication initiation, but their loss had distinct effects on replication protein recruitment (Figure 4). In the absence of DDK, none of the factors examined associated with the helicase-loaded origin DNA (Figures 4A–4C). In contrast, S-CDK activity was required for Mcm10, Dpb11, and GINS association but not for Sld3 and Cdc45. The association of Cdc45 and Sld3 in the absence of S-CDK suggested that DDK drives the formation of an initial complex (DDK-dependent complex) that is then acted upon in an S-CDK-catalyzed event to recruit Dpb11, GINS, and Mcm10. Consistent with a more robust association of Cdc45 with origins upon entry into S phase (Aparicio et al., 1999Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P.

USA. 1999; 96: 9130-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), salt extraction experiments showed that Cdc45 association is stabilized by the recruitment of the S-CDK-dependent factors (Figure S2).Figure S2Cdc45 Origin Association Is Stabilized by S-CDK-Dependent Events, Related to Figure 2 and Figures 4A–4CShow full captionCdc45 is more sensitive to salt extraction in the absence of S-CDK activity.

Our findings predict that Sld3 and Cdc45 origin recruitment depends on DDK; however, Sld3 and Cdc45 associate with early origins in G1 (Aparicio et al., 1999Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P.

Holzen T.M. Cell cycle regulation of DNA replication.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 237-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To address the role of DDK during the G1 recruitment of Cdc45 and Sld3, we compared their origin association in CDC7 wild-type and temperature-sensitive (cdc7–4) cells. Due to reduced Cdc45 and Sld3 origin binding at 37°C in wild-type cells (data not shown), we performed this analysis at 25°C (Cdc45) or 32°C (Sld3). Using either ChIP-Chip (Cdc45) or ChIP-PCR (Sld3, Table S4), we found that association of Cdc45 and Sld3 with early firing origins during G1 (ARS305, ARS306, and ARS307) was reduced in cdc7–4 cells (Figures 4D and 4E). Weak Cdc45 association with some late firing origins was not reduced by the cdc7 mutation (Figure 4E, ARS316), potentially due to residual Cdc7 activity at 25°C. Analysis of sites of Cdc45 binding reduced in the cdc7–4 background identified 49 origins, most of which initiate in the first 20% of S phase (Table S1). Thus, DDK is active in late G1 cells and drives the association of Cdc45 and Sld3 with early origins prior to the S-CDK-dependent recruitment of Sld2, Dpb11, and GINS. Additional experiments support a model in which DDK acts prior to CDK at the origin. We observed the highest levels of replication protein origin association and replication initiation when the loaded helicases were exposed to DDK first, then exposed to CDK in the S phase extract (Figures 4A and 4C, DDK→CDK). Addition of DDK to the S phase extract exposed the loaded helicases to both kinases simultaneously (DDK with CDK) and resulted in lower protein association and initiation. Finally, if loaded helicases were exposed to CDK and S phase extracts followed by CDK inactivation and addition of DDK (CDK→DDK), we observed no replication initiation (Figure 4C). Intriguingly, under these conditions, association of Cdc45, GINS, and Mcm10 was dramatically reduced (Figures 4A and 4C), even though equivalent DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4 was observed (Figure 4C, lanes 6 and 7). This suggests that prior exposure to CDK prevents subsequent DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2–7 from driving origin recruitment of Cdc45 or GINS. Three DNA polymerases act at the eukaryotic replication fork, but the assembly of these enzymes at the replisome is poorly understood. Because of their affinity for ssDNA templates, DNA polymerase recruitment could require origin unwinding, but this has only been addressed for DNA Pol α (Walter and Newport, 2000Walter J. Newport J. Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication: origin unwinding and sequential chromatin association of Cdc45, RPA, and DNA polymerase alpha.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DNA polymerases could directly or indirectly interact with loaded helicase even in the absence of DNA unwinding. Mcm10 has been shown to interact with and stabilize Pol α/primase; however, its role in the initial recruitment of DNA polymerases is unknown. We first asked whether Mcm10 was involved in DNA polymerase recruitment. Depletion of Mcm10 dramatically reduced Pol α loading and DNA replication (Figures 5A and 5B ). These effects were not due to the destabilization of Pol α in the absence of Mcm10 (Ricke and Bielinsky, 2004Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mcm10 regulates the stability and chromatin association of DNA polymerase-alpha.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) because addition of purified Mcm10 restored both events. Mcm10 depletion had little effect on Pol ɛ recruitment but reduced Pol δ association by half. Notably, addition of purified MBP-Mcm10 stimulated Pol δ recruitment and DNA synthesis compared with the unperturbed extract (Figure 5A, lanes 7–9, Figure 5B), suggesting that Mcm10 facilitates Pol δ origin recruitment and that Mcm10 was limiting for this event. To investigate the connection between origin unwinding and replisome assembly, we monitored association of the ssDNA-binding protein RPA with the template DNA. RPA association with the circular template was dependent on ATP hydrolysis (Figure 6A , +ATPγS), pre-RC formation (Figure 6A, -Cdc6), and Cdc45 (Figure 6B). ATPγS was added after DDK phosphorylation of the Mcm2–7 complex. Consistent with"

Despite modern surgical and medical treatments, the median survival for glioblastoma patients (WHO grade IV astrocytoma) remains only 14.6 months (Stupp et al., 2005Stupp R.

The identification of highly tumorigenic subpopulations within gliomas has fueled enthusiasm for development of novel antiglioma therapeutics. Due to their high tumorigenic potential and stem cell-like behavior, these cells have earned a variety of names, including tumor-propagating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs). Unlike the bulk tumor mass, CSCs exhibit sustained self-renewal and produce secondary tumors that recapitulate the parent tumor's features and cellular diversity (Bonnet and Dick, 1997Bonnet D.

Regardless of the etiology for tumor heterogeneity, the potent tumor-propagation capacity of CSCs suggests a utility for glioma stem cell (GSC)-directed therapies. As their name suggests, CSCs share features with nonneoplastic stem cells. Gene expression profiles of GSCs resemble those of embryonic stem cells (Ben-Porath et al., 2008Ben-Porath I. Thomson M.W.

Development of strategies that target CSCs while sparing normal stem cell function is therefore necessary to attain a CSC-selective therapeutic index, a notion that has been supported by studies of leukemic versus hematopoietic stem cells (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H.

In contrast, this concept is relatively unexplored in GSCs versus neural stem cells. Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) exhibits pleiotropic roles within cancer cells and tumors, and studies employing inhibition or genetic deletion of endogenous NO synthases (NOSs) support a tumor-promoting role for NO (Fukumura et al., 2006Fukumura D.

NOS isoforms exhibit heterogeneous expression patterns within glioma cell populations (Bakshi et al., 1998Bakshi A. Nag T.C. Wadhwa S. Mahapatra A.K. Sarkar C.

This heterogeneity may reflect a NOS expression pattern that is restricted to specific glioma subpopulations. This raises the possibility that NOS activity could be unique to GSC subpopulations, as one determinant of glioma heterogeneity relates to the existence of GSCs. Along these lines, studies have suggested a protumorigenic role for NO in gliomas (Charles et al., 2010Charles N. Ozawa T. Squatrito M. Bleau A.M. Brennan C.W. Hambardzumyan D. Holland E.C.

Endothelial NOS3 localizes near neoplastic cells displaying stem cell markers, and exogenous NO donors support stem cell signaling pathways in murine glioma cells (Charles et al., 2010Charles N.

The possibility of GSC-specific endogenous NO synthesis remain unevaluated, and the contribution of other more targetable NOS isoforms to GSCs remains unexamined. Given the precedence that NO can support tumor growth and the aforementioned studies suggesting a pro-GSC effect for NO, we hypothesized that endogenous NO production might be augmented within GSCs relative to nonstem glioma cells (non-GSCs), thus promoting the established tumorigenic phenotype of GSCs. Employing techniques described in the Dirks group's original report first validating CD133 as a GSC cell surface marker (Singh et al., 2003Singh S.K. Clarke I.D. Terasaki M. Bonn V.E. Hawkins C. Squire J. Dirks P.B. Identification of a cancer stem cell in human brain tumors.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5821-5828PubMed Google Scholar), we characterized a variety of human tumor specimens and xenografts in which positive selection for CD133 segregates GSC-enriched populations from non-GSCs, as demonstrated by measures of self-renewal, stem cell marker expression, and tumor propagation potential (Bao et al., 2006aBao S.

When CD133-based selection is utilized and stem cell-permissive culture conditions employed (Lee et al., 2006Lee J. Kotliarova S. Kotliarov Y. Li A. Su Q. Donin N.M. Pastorino S. Purow B.W. Christopher N. Zhang W. et al.Tumor stem cells derived from glioblastomas cultured in bFGF and EGF more closely mirror the phenotype and genotype of primary tumors than do serum-cultured cell lines.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 391-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar), CD133 marker expression is maintained (Figures S1A and S1B available online). Using this CD133-based selection system, we compared the NO production capacity of CD133+ glioma cells (GSCs) with CD133– glioma cells (non-GSCs). We measured nitrite (NO2−), a stable byproduct of NO, in the culture medium using matched cultures from xenografted patient specimens. GSCs produced more NO2− than matched non-GSCs (Figure 1A ), suggesting that elevated NO synthesis may be a distinctive feature of GSCs. To examine the function of endogenous NO in GSCs, we designed and biochemically validated a strategy to deplete NO in mammalian cells (Forrester et al., 2011Forrester M.T. Eyler C.E. Rich J.N. Bacterial flavohemoglobin: a molecular tool to probe mammalian nitric oxide biology.Biotechniques. 2011; 50: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). While not conserved in mammals, bacteria and fungi employ flavohemoglobin (FlavoHb)—a potent NO-consuming enzyme that converts NO to nitrate (NO3−) (Figure 1B)—to protect from nitrosative stress (Gardner et al., 1998Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Nitric oxide dioxygenase: an enzymic function for flavohemoglobin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, Hausladen et al., 2001Hausladen A. Gow A. Stamler J.S.

Nitrosative stress: metabolic pathway involving the flavohemoglobin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 14100-14105Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Within GSCs and non-GSCs, we employed lentiviral-based expression of the E. coli FlavoHb. Efficient NO consumption by this approach was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with a CMV-driven NOS2, which results in supraphysiologic levels of NO (Figure 1C). Expression of FlavoHb impaired GSC growth (Figure 1D and Figure S1C) and neurosphere formation (Figure 1E and Figure S1D), though these effects were absent in CD133– non-GSCs and did not impact HEK293 cells that lack NO dependence (Figure S1E). Consumption of NO in GSCs via FlavoHb abrogated critical GSCs properties in vitro, suggesting a progrowth role for endogenous NO synthesis in GSCs. While FlavoHb blocked NO availability and decreased GSC growth, the source of GSC-derived NO remained unclear. Glioma stem cells from primary patient specimens (Figure 2A ) and human glioma xenografts (Figure 2B) displayed higher levels of NOS2 protein than matched non-GSCs, while no consistent expression pattern for NOS1 or NOS3 was observed. These data suggest that NOS2 expression in GSCs might contribute to their malignant properties, as (1) NOS2 is the most highly productive NOS, (2) NOS2 is regulated largely at the level of transcription, and (3) GSCs demonstrated elevated endogenous NO production that contributed to GSC growth. Although CD133 is useful for identifying GSCs (Bao et al., 2006aBao S. Wu Q. McLendon R.E. Hao Y. Shi Q. Hjelmeland A.B. Dewhirst M.W. Bigner D.D. Rich J.N.

The optimal method for defining GSC marker effectiveness likely depends on individual tumor characteristics and is a topic of active investigation. The marker stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA1; CD15) has been reported to effectively isolate GSCs from some tumors with low CD133 expression (Son et al., 2009Son M.J. Woolard K. Nam D.H. Lee J. Fine H.A. SSEA-1 is an enrichment marker for tumor-initiating cells in human glioblastoma.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 440-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Cell lysates from two of these previously reported tumors revealed elevated NOS2 expression in SSEA1+ GSCs relative to SSEA1– non-GSCs (Figure 2C). Positive selection for SSEA1 segregated for tumorigenic GSCs (as measured in transplantation assays) in these tumors from which we acquired SSEA1+ and SSEA1– protein lysates (Son et al., 2009Son M.J. Woolard K. Nam D.H. Lee J. Fine H.A. SSEA-1 is an enrichment marker for tumor-initiating cells in human glioblastoma.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 440-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that NOS2 cosegregates with GSC phenotypes in gliomas where CD133 or SSEA1 are useful for enriching GSCs. To examine whether differential NOS2 expression is inadvertently driven by cell culture conditions, we used qRT-PCR to quantify NOS2 messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from CD133+ and CD133– populations isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from fresh dissociated human gliomas without intervening culture. Levels of NOS2 mRNA were higher in GSCs relative to non-GSCs from three different primary human gliomas and a xenograft (Figure 2D). Previously described minor NOS2 splice variants (Eissa et al., 1996Eissa N.T. Strauss A.J. Haggerty C.M. Choo E.K. Chu S.C. Moss J.

Although these data indicate that full-length NOS2 transcripts are elevated in GSCs in vivo, we further evaluated NOS2 protein and GSCs in human tissue. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated coexpression of CD133 and NOS2 protein in human glioma tissue sections (Figure 2E and Figure S2B). Flow cytometry analysis of dissociated primary human glioma specimens showed that greater than 80% of NOS2-positive cells also express CD133 (Figure 2F). These findings collectively support the notion that NOS2 expression is elevated in GSCs. To determine whether NOS2 is critical for GSC NO production, cells were treated with the highly selective NOS2 inhibitor 1400W (Garvey et al., 1997Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Furfine E.S. Kiff R.J. Laszlo F. Whittle B.J. Knowles R.G. 1400W is a slow, tight binding, and highly selective inhibitor of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in vitro and in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4959-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Synthesis of NO was markedly attenuated in 1400W-treated GSCs, which had elevated NO production at baseline versus non-GSCs (Figure 2G and Figure S2C). Though in some tumors 1400W qualitatively decreased NO production in non-GSCs, this effect was less pronounced and not statistically significant in the setting of low overall NO production and minimal NOS2 expression in non-GSCs (Figure 2G). Consumption of NO by FlavoHb blocked GSC growth and neurosphere formation (Figures 1D and 1E and Figures S1C and S1D) and NO production in GSCs was largely NOS2 dependent (Figure 2G). We therefore hypothesized that NOS2 activity in GSCs contributes to their known malignant properties. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of NOS2 (Figure 3A ) resulted in decreased GSC growth and proliferation (Figures 3B–3D and Figures S3A–S3E) but had minimal effect on non-GSCs (Figures 3B–3D and Figures S3A, S3B, S3D, and S3E ). Further, NOS2-directed shRNA decreased neurosphere formation in xenograft-derived GSCs (Figure 3E and Figure S3C). Neurospheres surviving NOS2-directed shRNA still expressed NOS2 mRNA (assessed by qRT-PCR; data not shown) and thus were likely derived from cells that did not undergo NOS2 knockdown or silenced NOS2-directed shRNA expression. Though FlavoHb does not affect the expression of NOS2 (Figure S3F), the antigrowth effect of NOS2-directed shRNA was comparable to results with FlavoHb-mediated NO consumption in GSCs (Figure S3G). Consistent with these results, the NOS2 inhibitor 1400W decreased GSC survival, proliferation, and neurosphere formation (Figures 3F–3H and Figures S3H–S3J), as did several other less-potent or less-selective NOS2 inhibitors (Figure S3K).Figure S3NOS2-Directed Interventions Decrease the Growth and Proliferation of CD133+ Glioma GSCs, Related to Figure 3Show full captionCD133+ and CD133- cells from the T3832 xenograft were infected for 48 hr with lentivirus bearing either a scrambled or two different NOS2-directed shRNAs.(A) shRNA-expressing CD133+ and CD133- cells were grown for 72 hr and cell number was assessed by trypan blue staining with cell counting.(B) Cell proliferation of glioma GSCs was analyzed by determination of 3H-thymidine incorporation 48 hr after infection with the indicated shRNA-bearing lentiviruses.(C) CD133+ and CD133- cells from xenografted tumors were infected for 48 hr with the indicated lentiviral particles and then viable cells were individually sorted into single wells.

https://openalex.org/W1597068157,"The amyloid-β peptide Aβ42 is known to be a primary amyloidogenic and pathogenic agent in Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of Aβ43, which is found just as frequently in the brains of affected individuals, remains unresolved. We generated knock-in mice containing a pathogenic presenilin-1 R278I mutation that causes overproduction of Aβ43. Homozygosity was embryonic lethal, indicating that the mutation involves a loss of function. Crossing amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice with heterozygous mutant mice resulted in elevated Aβ43, impairment of short-term memory and acceleration of amyloid-β pathology, which accompanied pronounced accumulation of Aβ43 in plaque cores similar in biochemical composition to those observed in the brains of affected individuals. Consistently, Aβ43 showed a higher propensity to aggregate and was more neurotoxic than Aβ42. Other pathogenic presenilin mutations also caused overproduction of Aβ43 in a manner correlating with Aβ42 and with the age of disease onset. These findings indicate that Aβ43, an overlooked species, is potently amyloidogenic, neurotoxic and abundant in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2121291985,"Chemotherapy has been reported to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells, which is a critical step in the process of metastasis leading to cancer spreading and treatment failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced EMT remain unclear, and the involvement of microRNAs (miRNA) in this process is poorly understood. To address these questions, we established stable chemotherapy-resistant tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cell lines CAL27-res and SCC25-res by exposing the parental CAL27 and SCC25 lines to escalating concentrations of cisplatin for 6 months. CAL27-res and SCC25-res cells displayed mesenchymal features with enhanced invasiveness and motility. MiRNA microarray illustrated that miR-200b and miR-15b were the most significantly downregulated microRNAs in CAL27-res cells. Ectopic expression of miR-200b and miR-15b with miRNA mimics effectively reversed the phenotype of EMT in CAL27-res and SCC25-res cells, and sensitized them to chemotherapy, but inhibition of miR-200b and miR-15b in the sensitive lines with anti-sense oligonucleotides induced EMT and conferred chemoresistance. Retrieving the expression of B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1), a target for miR-200b and miR-15b, in the presence of the miRNA mimics by transfecting CAL27-res cells with pcDNA3.1-BMI1-carrying mutated seed sequences of miR-200b or miR-15b at its 3'-UTR recapitulated chemotherapy-induced EMT. In vivo, enforced miR-200b or miR-15b expression suppressed metastasis of TSCC xenografts established by CAL27-res cells. Clinically, reduced miR-200b or miR-15b expression was associated with chemotherapeutic resistance in TSCCs and poor patient survival. Our data suggest that reduced expression of miR-200b and miR-15b underscores the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced EMT in TSCC, and may serve as therapeutic targets to reverse chemotherapy resistance in tongue cancers."

We provide definitive evidence that differentiation into all hematopoietic lineages, including megakaryocyte/erythroid cell types, involves Flk2-expressing non-self-renewing progenitors. A Flk2+ stage was used during steady-state hematopoiesis, after irradiation-induced stress and upon HSC transplantation. In contrast, HSC origin and maintenance do not include a Flk2+ stage.

Comprehensive knowledge of differentiation pathways and the molecular regulation of fate decisions is necessary to efficiently guide uncommitted cells into specific fates; such directed differentiation serves as the basis for ESC differentiation into cell types of therapeutic value. Differentiation pathways must also be understood to enable rational drug design. Indeed, the concept of therapeutic targeting of cancer stem cells relies on understanding the cellular events underlying oncogenesis and distinguishing those from normal cell differentiation.

Flk2 itself and Flk2+ lymphoid-committed populations have been shown to promote lymphoid development, as genetic deletion of Flk2 leads to decreased numbers of B lineage cells (Mackarehtschian et al., 1995Mackarehtschian K.

In contrast, myeloid-committed progenitors do not express Flk2, and Flk2-deficient mice have normal numbers of mature myeloid cells. Flk2 expression on KLS cells has also been reported to correlate with loss of MegE potential and prime uncommitted cells for a lymphoid fate (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J. Månsson R.

Extensive functional and molecular characterizations of Flk2+ KLS cells have demonstrated low MegE readout in vitro and increased expression of transcripts associated with lymphoid development, with retention of robust granulocyte/macrophage (GM) potential (Adolfsson et al., 2005Adolfsson J.

Quantitative assessment of the lineage potential of multiple cell populations in parallel showed that MegE contribution from Flk2+ multipotent progenitors (MPPF) was more robust than that from progenitor populations with undisputed MegE potential (Forsberg et al., 2006Forsberg E.C. Serwold T. Kogan S. Weissman I.L. Passegué E.

These seemingly contradictory findings raise the possibility that MPPF are capable of giving rise to MegE cells under conditions of acute need, but are normally dedicated to providing lymphoid cells. Transplantation assays, in combination with molecular characterization, have been unable to provide conclusive evidence for this model. Since no reports have ascertained the relative contribution of possible alternative pathways, the physiological relevance of different progenitor populations in development of distinct lineages remains uncertain (Figure 1A). Here, we have established a lineage tracing model that enabled us to determine the contribution of non-self-renewing MPPs, marked by Flk2 expression, to the distinct hematopoietic lineages during both steady-state and stress hematopoiesis in vivo. To determine which hematopoietic lineages develop through a Flk2+ stage, we generated “FlkSwitch” mice by crossing mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of Flk2 regulatory elements (“Flk2-Cre” BAC transgenic mice) (Benz et al., 2008Benz C. Martins V.C. Radtke F. Bleul C.C. The stream of precursors that colonizes the thymus proceeds selectively through the early T lineage precursor stage of T cell development.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to mice containing a dual-color fluorescent reporter in the Rosa26 locus (“mT/mG” mice) (Muzumdar et al., 2007Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B. Miyamichi K. Li L. Luo L. A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse.Genesis. 2007; 45: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). We expected that all cells in the resulting FlkSwitch mice would express the red-fluorescing protein Tomato (Tom), with the exception of cells expressing Cre because Cre-mediated excision of Tom would result in induction of GFP expression. Importantly, because Tom excision is an irreversible genetic event, all progeny of Cre-expressing cells would also express GFP regardless of whether these progeny themselves express Cre. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that >99% of platelets and nucleated BM and PB (peripheral blood) cells in both mT/mG and FlkSwitch mice express either the Tom or GFP reporter gene. We envisioned two main experimental outcomes: if Flk2+ progenitors are significant physiological contributors to erythro- and megakaryopoiesis in vivo, MegE cells would inherit the floxed, GFP-expressing reporter allele and be GFP+, as indicated in the left schematic of Figure 1A. Alternatively, Flk2+ progenitors may be capable of providing MegE cells when transplanted into irradiated animals due to the acute requirement for erythrocytes and platelets, but may not normally contribute to MegE generation. In this model, Flk2– multipotent progenitors or HSCs would give rise to common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) or megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEPs) without differentiation through a Flk2+ stage, and mature MegE and/or GMs, and their progenitors, would remain Tom+ (Figure 1A, right model). To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the color of distinct cell types in FlkSwitch mice by multicolor flow cytometry. HSCs were defined as Flk2– BM cells that were also c-kit+, Lin–, Sca1+, CD150+, and CD48– (Figure S1A available online). This population contains all Flk2– KLS cells and is heterogeneous for CD34, and thus includes cells that have been referred to as “ST-HSC” in previous reports (Figure S1B). The entire remaining KLS fraction was divided into ST-HSCF and MPPF based on the level of Flk2 expression (intermediate for ST-HSCF and high for MPPF) and differential expression of CD150 and CD48 (Figure S1A). Importantly, HSCs expressed the Tom transgene, but not GFP (Figure 1C, Table 1), demonstrating that excision of GFP does not occur aberrantly in Flk2– populations. Lack of recombination in HSCs also demonstrated that all developmental precursors of HSCs are Flk2–. Analysis of ST-HSCF and MPPF revealed a dramatic color change from Tom to GFP as Flk2 and Cre expression was turned on (Figure 1C, Figure S2A, Table 1). This striking color switch (up to 97%) from Flk2– HSCs to Flk2+ MPPs established that the reporter model operated as expected.Table 1Percent GFP in Hematopoietic Populations from FlkSwitch MiceMouse #HSCST-HSCFMPPFCMPGMPMEPGMEPPltCLP∗∗B cell∗∗T cell∗1016777107615382320276691068143220305121212131112132747234051210121213121327502850420182019211821254419606389919089868692919794705190888991908893919992804490888990899092979896906192929293929291961009510037949494949393939810097110689594939292938698999412045959595979497981001009613074969494939494939910094140609798999998989699100100The differences between MPPF versus CLPs, B cells, and T cells were significant (∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗p < 0.01, respectively), by Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.

See also Figure S2.

HSCs and ST-HSCF were also significantly different from MPPF and all other populations. No other comparisons to MPPF were significantly different. Abbreviations are as in Figure 1. See also Figure S2. Strikingly, all cell populations of the myeloid lineage, including CMPs, granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), MEPs, erythroid progenitors (EPs), and platelets (Plts), exhibited the same GFP percentage as MPPF (Figures 1C–1E, Figure S2A, Table 1). Subfractionation of myeloid populations using alternative markers (Pronk et al., 2007Pronk C.J. Rossi D.J. Månsson R. Attema J.L. Norddahl G.L. Chan C.K. Sigvardsson M. Weissman I.L. Bryder D. Elucidation of the phenotypic, functional, and molecular topography of a myeloerythroid progenitor cell hierarchy.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 428-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) revealed similar results (Figure S2B). The almost complete color switch (up to 98%) in erythroid cells and Plts was particularly surprising given the uncertainty of Flk2+ cell contribution to MegE lineages. Even in mice with low floxing efficiency in Flk2+ populations (mice #1-5 in Table 1; Figure S2A), the GFP+ percentage in all myeloid and erythroid cell populations closely followed the GFP+ percentage in MPPF (Figures 1D and 1E, Table 1). To determine whether myeloid cells switch color due to differentiation through a Flk2+ progenitor stage or due to aberrant recombination, we investigated Cre expression and activity. Cre mRNA was readily detectable in MPPF, but not in HSCs or myeloid progenitors, demonstrating a Flk2-dependent Cre expression pattern (Figure 2A ). We then tested whether myeloid progenitors exhibit Cre recombinase activity. Unfloxed (Tom+) and floxed (GFP+) CMPs and MPPF were isolated from FlkSwitch mice and differentiated in vitro or transplanted into recipient mice. As expected, all progeny of GFP+ CMPs and MPPF in vitro and in the PB and spleen of recipient mice were GFP+ (Figures 2B–2D). In contrast, Tom+ MPPF gave rise to both Tom+ and GFP+ progeny in all three assays (Figures 2B–2D). Importantly, we never detected GFP+ progeny from Tom+ CMPs, as they exclusively gave rise to Tom+ progeny in vitro and in vivo. The lack of detectable Cre mRNA and recombinase activity in myeloid progenitors and their progeny demonstrated that Cre is expressed and functional in a Flk2-dependent pattern, and support a model wherein myeloid cells are derived from Flk2-expressing progenitors. The highly variable floxing efficiency between different mice (from 6% to 97% in MPPF) makes it unlikely that Tom+ and GFP+ cells within a phenotypic fraction are fundamentally different. Transcriptional analysis revealed a trend toward increased levels of Flk2 and Cre mRNA in GFP+ compared to Tom+ MPPF (Figure 3A ), consistent with floxing efficiency increasing with Flk2 levels. To directly test whether floxed and unfloxed cells are functionally equivalent, we compared the in vivo colony forming units spleen (CFU-S) and PB reconstitution abilities of purified Tom+ and GFP+ MPPF and CMPs. We did not detect significant differences in PB reconstitution potential (Figures 3B and 3C) or CFU-S frequencies (Figures 3D and 3E) between Tom+ and GFP+ MPPF or between Tom+ and GFP+ CMPs. We then analyzed the relative number of Cre transgenes between different mice by performing qPCR of genomic DNA. Indeed, mice with low floxing efficiency had fewer copies of the Flk2-Cre construct compared to high-floxing mice (Figure 3F). These data are consistent with the increase in floxing efficiency observed upon selective backcrossing of FlkSwitch mice. Collectively, these results led us to conclude that Tom+ and GFP+ cells within a phenotypic population are functionally equivalent and that the differential floxing efficiency between different mice is due to varying copy numbers of the Cre transgene. In contrast to MegE development, there is considerable agreement that MPPF are capable of both GM and lymphoid differentiation (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D.

In addition, several populations with lymphoid-restricted potential, including common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and fractions of ProB and ProT cells, express Flk2 (Karsunky et al., 2003Karsunky H. Merad M. Cozzio A. Weissman I.L. Manz M.G. Flt3 ligand regulates dendritic cell development from Flt3+ lymphoid and myeloid-committed progenitors to Flt3+ dendritic cells in vivo.J. Exp.

Flk2+ common lymphoid progenitors possess equivalent differentiation potential for the B and T lineages.Blood. 2008; 111: 5562-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is therefore less surprising that cells of the lymphoid lineage also switch to GFP expression in the FlkSwitch mice (Figure 1C, Figure S1, Table 1). Indeed, statistical analysis revealed that Tom excision increased during lymphoid development (Table 1). Because it is not possible to substantially increase the percentage of floxed cells when it's already very high in MPPF, this effect is most apparent in low-efficiency floxers (mice numbers 1–5 in Table 1; Figure 1E). The increased reporter switch is likely a result of sustained Cre expression during development through additional Flk2+ progenitor stages, such as CLP, ProB, and ProT cells (Karsunky et al., 2003Karsunky H. Merad M. Cozzio A. Weissman I.L. Manz M.G. Flt3 ligand regulates dendritic cell development from Flt3+ lymphoid and myeloid-committed progenitors to Flt3+ dendritic cells in vivo.J. Exp.

Flk2+ common lymphoid progenitors possess equivalent differentiation potential for the B and T lineages.Blood. 2008; 111: 5562-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, myeloid cells did not display a detectable increase in percent GFP+ cells compared to MPPF, consistent with Flk2+ cells not contributing significantly to myelopoiesis beyond the MPPF stage. To test whether alternative differentiation pathways can be used when there is an acute requirement for MegE cells, we analyzed the color composition of hematopoietic cells under stress conditions. First, we subjected FlkSwitch mice to sublethal irradiation and analyzed the color composition of mature cells in the PB over time. Intriguingly, the percentage of GFP+ Plts, EPs, and GMs, but not B and T cells, decreased for the first 3 weeks after irradiation (Figure 4A ). Three weeks postirradiation, the percentage of GFP+ myeloid cells started to rebound. A second sublethal dose of irradiation at week 5 elicited a similar response, with GFP percentages in Plts, EPs, and GM cells decreasing for 3 weeks to then increase over the next several weeks (Figure 4A). The magnitude of the changes in GFP percentages was similar for Plts, EPs, and GM cells, whereas neither B nor T cells displayed significant changes in the percent of GFP+ cells. The myeloid-specific decrease in GFP frequencies upon irradiation suggested that a proportion of the myeloid cells may be derived directly from Flk2– progenitors, “skipping” the Flk2+ intermediate stage used during steady-state hematopoiesis. Alternatively, overall floxing efficiency could be decreased in Flk2+ progenitors. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the color composition of stem and progenitor cells in the BM at 2 weeks (one sublethal dose) and 19 weeks (two sublethal doses) postirradiation. As shown in Figures 4C and 4D, the percentage of GFP+ MPPF was the same as that of mature myeloid cells, and of all myeloid progenitor populations. These data are inconsistent with a bypass pathway and instead support an irradiation-induced decrease in floxing efficiency. Indeed, comparing GFP percentages of cells from unirradiated mice (Figure 4B) to cells from irradiated mice (Figures 4C and 4D) with similar floxing efficiencies in the PB prior to irradiation (∼95%) indicated that irradiation caused a reduction in floxing efficiency in MPPF. This effect was not detectable in B and T cells, presumably due to the multiple Flk2+ progenitor stages during lymphoid differentiation. We then tested differentiation pathways upon transplantation. HSCs isolated from high-floxing (∼95% GFP+ myeloid PB cells) FlkSwitch mice were transplanted into sublethally irradiated wild-type mice, followed by PB analysis of donor-derived progeny. Figure 5A shows the robust, long-term reconstitution of nucleated blood cells and Plts in recipient mice. Analysis of the color composition of PB progeny revealed that the percentages of GFP+ Plts, GM, and"

Here, we performed integrated analyses to identify genomic alterations that co-occur with oncogenic BRAF in melanoma and abrogate cellular dependence upon this oncogene. We identified concurrent mutational inactivation of the PTEN and RB1 tumor suppressors as a mechanism for loss of BRAF/MEK dependence in melanomas harboring (V600E)BRAF mutations. RB1 alterations were mutually exclusive with loss of p16(INK4A), suggesting that whereas p16(INK4A) and RB1 may have overlapping roles in preventing tumor formation, tumors with loss of RB1 exhibit diminished dependence upon BRAF signaling for cell proliferation. These findings provide a genetic basis for the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes in patients treated with targeted inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Our results also suggest a need for comprehensive screening for RB1 and PTEN inactivation in patients treated with RAF and MEK-selective inhibitors to determine whether these alterations are associated with diminished clinical benefit in patients whose cancers harbor mutant BRAF."

https://openalex.org/W2134737949,"In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), inactivation of the tumor suppressor von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) occurs in the majority of the tumors and is causal for the pathogenesis of ccRCC. Recently, a large-scale genomic sequencing study of ccRCC tumors revealed that enzymes that regulate histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3), such as JARID1C/KDM5C/SMCX and MLL2, were mutated in ccRCC tumors, suggesting that H3K4Me3 might have an important role in regulating gene expression and tumorigenesis. In this study we report that in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells, the overall H3K4Me3 levels were significantly lower than that of VHL+/+ counterparts. Furthermore, this was hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) dependent, as depletion of HIF subunits by small hairpin RNA in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells restored H3K4Me3 levels. In addition, we demonstrated that only loss of JARID1C, not JARID1A or JARID1B, abolished the difference of H3K4Me3 levels between VHL−/− and VHL+/+ cells, and JARID1C displayed HIF-dependent expression pattern. JARID1C in VHL−/− cells was responsible for the suppression of HIF-responsive genes insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), DNAJC12, COL6A1, growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and density-enhanced phosphatase 1. Consistent with these findings, the H3K4Me3 levels at the promoters of IGFBP3, DNAJC12, COL6A1 and GDF15 were lower in VHL−/− cells than in VHL+/+ cells, and the differences disappeared after JARID1C depletion. Although HIF2α is an oncogene in ccRCC, some of its targets might have tumor suppressive activity. Consistent with this, knockdown of JARID1C in 786-O VHL−/− ccRCC cells significantly enhanced tumor growth in a xenograft model, suggesting that JARID1C is tumor suppressive and its mutations are tumor promoting in ccRCC. Thus, VHL inactivation decreases H3K4Me3 levels through JARID1C, which alters gene expression and suppresses tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2021809205,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis by regulating oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. In this study, miR-187 and miR-200a were found to be expressed at higher levels in ovarian cancers than in benign tumors. In patients with ovarian cancer, however, higher levels of miR-187 and miR-200a expression were paradoxically associated with better OS and recurrence-free survival. Further, multivariate analysis showed that miR-187 served as an independent prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer (n=176). Computational prediction and microarray results indicated that miR-187 directly targeted Disabled homolog-2 (Dab2), and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the target site of miR-187 was located at the 3'-UTR of the Dab2 gene. Generally considered as a tumor-suppressor gene, Dab2 may actually promote tumor progression in advanced cancers through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Ectopic expression of miR-187 in cancer cells promoted cell proliferation, but continued overexpression of miR-187 suppressed Dab2 and inhibited migration. Suppression of miR-187 upregulated Dab2, which, by inhibiting E-cadherin levels while stimulating vimentin and phospho-FAK levels, promoted EMT. Reduced ovarian cancer Dab2 histoscores correlated with high miR-187 levels and improved outcomes of patients. Collectively, these results demonstrate distinct dual roles of Dab2 in cell proliferation and tumor progression. In the initial steps of tumorigenesis, upregulated miR-187 suppresses Dab2, promoting cell proliferation. During the later stages, however, continued increased levels of miR-187 inhibits the Dab2-dependent EMT that is associated with tumor invasiveness, which is presumed to be the reason why cancers with high miR-187 levels were associated with better survivals."
https://openalex.org/W1981706467,"The owl captures prey using sound localization. In the classical model, the owl infers sound direction from the position of greatest activity in a brain map of auditory space. However, this model fails to describe the actual behavior. Although owls accurately localize sources near the center of gaze, they systematically underestimate peripheral source directions. We found that this behavior is predicted by statistical inference, formulated as a Bayesian model that emphasizes central directions. We propose that there is a bias in the neural coding of auditory space, which, at the expense of inducing errors in the periphery, achieves high behavioral accuracy at the ethologically relevant range. We found that the owl's map of auditory space decoded by a population vector is consistent with the behavioral model. Thus, a probabilistic model describes both how the map of auditory space supports behavior and why this representation is optimal."

It contains three subcomplexes, one of which is a seven-subunit head module. Imasaki et al. have solved the crystallographic structure of the Mediator head module from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The subunits form a stable assembly with recognizable binding sites for transcription accessory factors and RNA polymerase II. The structure suggests how transcription factor IIH and the polymerase C-terminal domain are aligned to facilitate phosphorylation of the latter. Mediator is a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription1, connecting activators and repressors bound to regulatory DNA elements with RNA polymerase II1,2,3,4 (Pol II). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mediator comprises 25 subunits with a total mass of more than one megadalton (refs 5, 6) and is organized into three modules, called head, middle/arm and tail7,8,9. Our understanding of Mediator assembly and its role in regulating transcription has been impeded so far by limited structural information. Here we report the crystal structure of the essential Mediator head module (seven subunits, with a mass of 223 kilodaltons) at a resolution of 4.3 ångströms. Our structure reveals three distinct domains, with the integrity of the complex centred on a bundle of ten helices from five different head subunits. An intricate pattern of interactions within this helical bundle ensures the stable assembly of the head subunits and provides the binding sites for general transcription factors and Pol II. Our structural and functional data suggest that the head module juxtaposes transcription factor IIH and the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest subunit of Pol II, thereby facilitating phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of Pol II. Our results reveal architectural principles underlying the role of Mediator in the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1981931395,"The mechanisms that generate specific neuronal connections in the brain are under intense investigation. In zebrafish, retinal ganglion cells project their axons into at least six layers within the neuropil of the midbrain tectum. Each axon elaborates a single, planar arbor in one of the target layers and forms synapses onto the dendrites of tectal neurons. We show that the laminar specificity of retinotectal connections does not depend on self-sorting interactions among RGC axons. Rather, tectum-derived Slit1, signaling through axonal Robo2, guides neurites to their target layer. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that Slit binds to Dragnet (Col4a5), a type IV Collagen, which forms the basement membrane on the surface of the tectum. We further show that radial glial endfeet are required for the basement-membrane anchoring of Slit. We propose that Slit1 signaling, perhaps in the form of a superficial-to-deep gradient, presents laminar positional cues to ingrowing retinal axons."
https://openalex.org/W2158359318,"Zinc is abundant in the central nervous system and regulates pain, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In vitro studies have shown that extracellular zinc modulates a plethora of signaling membrane proteins, including NMDA receptors containing the NR2A subunit, which display exquisite zinc sensitivity. We created NR2A-H128S knock-in mice to investigate whether Zn2+-NR2A interaction influences pain control. In these mice, high-affinity (nanomolar) zinc inhibition of NMDA currents was lost in the hippocampus and spinal cord. Knock-in mice showed hypersensitivity to radiant heat and capsaicin, and developed enhanced allodynia in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Furthermore, zinc-induced analgesia was completely abolished under both acute and chronic pain conditions. Our data establish that zinc is an endogenous modulator of excitatory neurotransmission in vivo and identify a new mechanism in pain processing that relies on NR2A NMDA receptors. The study also potentially provides a molecular basis for the pain-relieving effects of dietary zinc supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2005576231,"Hsu and colleagues show that COPI-coated buds are a common progenitor for both vesicles and tubules. The choice between these two carriers is mediated by the opposing activities of the acyltransferase LPAAT-γ and the phospholipase cPLA2-α. Intracellular transport occurs through two general types of carrier, either vesicles1,2 or tubules3,4. Coat proteins act as the core machinery that initiates vesicle formation1,2, but the counterpart that initiates tubule formation has been unclear. Here, we find that the coat protein I (COPI) complex initially drives the formation of Golgi buds. Subsequently, a set of opposing lipid enzymatic activities determines whether these buds become vesicles or tubules. Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase-γ (LPAATγ) promotes COPI vesicle fission for retrograde vesicular transport. In contrast, cytosolic phospholipase A2-α (cPLA2α) inhibits this fission event to induce COPI tubules, which act in anterograde intra-Golgi transport and Golgi ribbon formation. These findings not only advance a molecular understanding of how COPI vesicle fission is achieved, but also provide insight into how COPI acts in intra-Golgi transport and reveal an unexpected mechanistic relationship between vesicular and tubular transport."
https://openalex.org/W2035199905,"Histone modification marks have an important role in many chromatin processes. During DNA replication, both heterochromatin and euchromatin are disrupted ahead of the replication fork and are then reassembled into their original epigenetic states behind the fork. How histone marks are accurately inherited from generation to generation is still poorly understood. In fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated histone methylation is cell cycle regulated. Centromeric repeats are transiently transcribed in the S phase of the cell cycle and are processed into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the complexes RITS (RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing) and RDRC (RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex). The small RNAs together with silencing factors-including Dos1 (also known as Clr8 and Raf1), Dos2 (also known as Clr7 and Raf2), Rik1 and Lid2-promote heterochromatic methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) by a histone methyltransferase, Clr4 (refs 8-13). The methylation of H3K9 provides a binding site for Swi6, a structural and functional homologue of metazoan heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Here we characterize a silencing complex in fission yeast that contains Dos2, Rik1, Mms19 and Cdc20 (the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-ε). This complex regulates RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) activity in heterochromatin and is required for DNA replication and heterochromatin assembly. Our findings provide a molecular link between DNA replication and histone methylation, shedding light on how epigenetic marks are transmitted during each cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1983178254,"In eukaryotic cells, the ribosome-Sec61 translocon complex (RTC) establishes membrane protein topology by cotranslationally partitioning nascent polypeptides into the cytosol, ER lumen, and lipid bilayer. Using photocrosslinking, collisional quenching, cysteine accessibility, and protease protection, we show that a canonical type II signal anchor (SA) acquires its topology through four tightly coupled and mechanistically distinct steps: (1) head-first insertion into Sec61α, (2) nascent chain accumulation within the RTC, (3) inversion from type I to type II topology, and (4) stable translocation of C-terminal flanking residues. Progression through each stage is induced by incremental increases in chain length and involves abrupt changes in the molecular environment of the SA. Importantly, type II SA inversion deviates from a type I SA at an unstable intermediate whose topology is controlled by dynamic interactions between the ribosome and translocon. Thus, the RTC coordinates SA topogenesis within a protected environment via sequential energetic transitions of the TM segment."
https://openalex.org/W1997209262,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) expressing pluripotency markers are assumed to possess equipotent developmental potential. However, disparate responses to differentiation stimuli functionally illustrate that hESCs generate a spectrum of differentiated cell types, suggestive of lineage bias. Here, we reveal specific cell surface markers that allow subfractionation of hESCs expressing hallmark markers of pluripotency. By direct de novo isolation of these subsets, we demonstrate that propensities for lineage differentiation are balanced with reduced clonogenic self-renewal. Histone modification marks of gene loci associated with pluripotency versus lineage specificity predicted cell fate potential of these subfractions, thereby supporting the absence of uniform bivalency as a molecular paradigm to describe cell fate determination of pluripotent cells. Our study reveals that cell fate potential is encoded within cells comprising hESC cultures, highlighting them as a means to understand the mechanisms of lineage specification of pluripotent cells."
https://openalex.org/W1987522796,"This study reports that CaMKIIβ is recruited to the centrosome by PCM1, where it promotes dendrite retraction and pruning via the phosphorylation and inhibition of Cdc20-APC. This effect is independent of its association with CaMKIIα. The protein kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) predominantly consists of the α and β isoforms in the brain. Although CaMKIIα functions have been elucidated, the isoform-specific catalytic functions of CaMKIIβ have remained unknown. Using knockdown analyses in primary rat neurons and in the rat cerebellar cortex in vivo, we report that CaMKIIβ operates at the centrosome in a CaMKIIα-independent manner to drive dendrite retraction and pruning. We also find that the targeting protein PCM1 (pericentriolar material 1) localizes CaMKIIβ to the centrosome. Finally, we uncover the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cdc20-APC (cell division cycle 20–anaphase promoting complex) as a centrosomal substrate of CaMKIIβ. CaMKIIβ phosphorylates Cdc20 at Ser51, which induces Cdc20 dispersion from the centrosome, thereby inhibiting centrosomal Cdc20-APC activity and triggering the transition from growth to retraction of dendrites. Our findings define a new, isoform-specific function for CaMKIIβ that regulates ubiquitin signaling at the centrosome and thereby orchestrates dendrite patterning, with important implications for neuronal connectivity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2139260555,"Tumor cell migration is a well-orchestrated multistep process that drives cancer development and metastasis. Previous data indicated that CD146 expression correlates with malignant progression and metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. However, the exact molecular mechanism of how CD146 promotes melanoma cell migration still remains poorly understood. Here, we report that CD146 physically interacts with actin-linking ezrin–radixin–moesin (ERM) proteins and recruits ERM proteins to cell protrusions, promoting the formation and elongation of microvilli. Moreover, CD146-promoted melanoma cell migration is linked to RhoA activation and ERM phosphorylation. CD146 recruits Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitory factors 1 (RhoGDI1) through ERM proteins and thus sequesters RhoGDI1 from RhoA, which leads to upregulated RhoA activity and increased melanoma cell motility. CD146-activated RhoA also promotes further ERM phosphorylation and activation through Rho-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate pathway, which reinforces CD146/ERM association. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic basis to understand the role of CD146 in regulating human melanoma cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2084495183,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can self-renew indefinitely under the governance of ESC-specific transcriptional circuitries in which each transcriptional factor regulates distinct or overlapping sets of genes with other factors. c-Myc is a key player that is crucially involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state and the self-renewal of ESCs. However, the mechanism by which c-Myc helps preserve the ESC status is still poorly understood. Here we addressed this question by performing loss-of-function studies with the Max gene, which encodes the best-characterized partner protein for all Myc family proteins. Although Myc/Max complexes are widely regarded as crucial regulators of the ESC status, our data revealed that ESCs do not absolutely require these complexes in certain contexts and that this requirement is restricted to empirical ESC culture conditions without a MAPK inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2114514966,"MYCN amplification is a major biomarker of poor prognosis, occurring in 25-30% of neuroblastomas. MYCN has contradictory roles in promoting cell growth and sensitizing cells to apoptosis. We have recently shown that p53 is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN in neuroblastoma and that p53-mediated apoptosis may be an important mechanism of MYCN-induced apoptosis. Although p53 mutations are rare in neuroblastoma at diagnosis, the p53/MDM2/p14(ARF) pathway is often inactivated through MDM2 amplification or p14(ARF) inactivation. We hypothesized that reactivation of p53 by inhibition of its negative regulator MDM2, using the MDM2-p53 antagonists Nutlin-3 and MI-63, will result in p53-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis especially in MYCN-amplified cells. Using the SHEP Tet21N MYCN-regulatable system, MYCN(-) cells were more resistant to both Nutlin-3 and MI-63 mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis compared with MYCN(+) cells and siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN in four MYCN-amplified cell lines resulted in decreased p53 expression and activation, as well as decreased levels of apoptosis following treatment with MDM2-p53 antagonists. In a panel of 18 neuroblastoma cell lines treated with Nutlin-3 and MI-63, the subset amplified for MYCN had a significantly lower mean GI(50) value (50% growth inhibition) and increased caspase 3/7 activity compared with the non-MYCN-amplified group of cell lines, but p53 mutant cell lines were resistant to the antagonists regardless of MYCN status. We conclude that amplification or overexpression of MYCN sensitizes neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type p53 to MDM2-p53 antagonists and that these compounds may therefore be particularly effective in treating high-risk MYCN-amplified disease."
https://openalex.org/W2067354786,"Several lines of evidence suggest that aberrant Notch signaling contributes to the development of several types of cancer. Activation of Notch receptor is executed through intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase, which is a multimeric membrane-embedded protease comprised of presenilin, nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx defective 1 and PEN-2. In this study, we report the neutralization of the γ-secretase activity by a novel monoclonal antibody A5226A against the extracellular domain of NCT, generated by using a recombinant budded baculovirus as an immunogen. This antibody recognized fully glycosylated mature NCT in the active γ-secretase complex on the cell surface, and inhibited the γ-secretase activity by competing with the substrate binding in vitro. Moreover, A5226A abolished the γ-secretase activity-dependent growth of cancer cells in a xenograft model. Our data provide compelling evidence that NCT is a molecular target for the mechanism-based inhibition of γ-secretase, and that targeting NCT might be a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer caused by aberrant γ-secretase activity and Notch signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2070997378,"A challenge of the synthetic biology approach is to use our understanding of a system to recreate a biological function with specific properties. We have applied this framework to bacterial enhancers, combining a driver, transcription factor binding sites, and a poised polymerase to create synthetic modular enhancers. Our findings suggest that enhancer-based transcriptional control depends critically and quantitatively on DNA looping, leading to complex regulatory effects when the enhancer cassettes contain additional transcription factor binding sites for TetR, a bacterial transcription factor. We show through a systematic interplay of experiment and thermodynamic modeling that the level of gene expression can be modulated to convert a variable inducer concentration input into discrete or step-like output expression levels. Finally, using a different DNA-binding protein (TraR), we show that the regulatory output is not a particular feature of the specific DNA-binding protein used for the enhancer but a general property of synthetic bacterial enhancers."

https://openalex.org/W2050655043,"Many malignancies show increased expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family member ErbB3 (HER3). ErbB3 binds heregulin β-1 (HRGβ1) and forms a heterodimer with other ErbB family members, such as ErbB2 (HER2) or EGF receptor (EGFR; HER1), enhancing phosphorylation of specific C-terminal tyrosine residues and activation of downstream signaling pathways. ErbB3 contains six YXXM motifs that bind the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase. Previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of ErbB3 in mammary tumor cells can significantly enhance chemotaxis to HRGβ1 and overall metastatic potential. We tested the hypothesis that ErbB3-mediated PI3-kinase signaling is critical for heregulin-induced motility, and therefore crucial for ErbB3-mediated invasion, intravasation and metastasis. The tyrosines in the six YXXM motifs on the ErbB3 C-terminus were replaced with phenylalanine. In contrast to overexpression of the wild-type ErbB3, overexpression of the mutant ErbB3 did not enhance chemotaxis towards HRGβ1 in vitro or in vivo. We also observed reduced tumor cell motility in the primary tumor by multiphoton microscopy, as well as a dramatically reduced ability of these cells to cross the endothelium and intravasate into the circulation. Moreover, whereas mutation of the ErbB3 C-terminus had no effect on tumor growth, it had a dramatic effect on spontaneous metastatic potential. Treatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitor PIK-75 similarly inhibited motility and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that stimulation of the early metastatic steps of motility and invasion by ErbB3 requires activation of the PI3-kinase pathway by the ErbB3 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2095311803,"We analyzed the effects of 14 different missense mutations in the RING domain of BRCA1 on the function of the protein in the control of centrosome number in tissue culture cells. Whereas 2 of the 14 BRCA1 variant proteins were neutral in the centrosome duplication assay, missense mutations of zinc-coordinating residues (C24R, C27A, C39Y, H41F, C44F and C47G) and mutations encoding BRCA1 variants M18T and I42V resulted in BRCA1 proteins that caused centrosome amplification. BRCA1 variant proteins I21V, I31M, L52F and D67Y had an intermediate effect on centrosome duplication. In addition, one of the variants, L52F, caused a peculiar phenotype with amplified centrosomes but the centrioles remained paired. By comparison, other BRCA1 variants that caused centrosome amplification had clustering of supernumerary centrosomes with unpaired centrioles. This surprising phenotype suggests that the BRCA1 protein regulates two functions in the control of centrosome duplication: regulation of centrosome number and regulation of centriole pairing. The L52F is unusual as it is defective in only one of these processes. This study analyzes the function of BRCA1 missense mutations in the control of centrosome duplication, a critical step in the maintenance of genetic stability of mammary epithelial cells, and indicates a new function of BRCA1 in the control of centriole pairing."

Our past findings indicated that glioblastoma cells, but not neurons or glia, require the transcription factor ATF5 (activating transcription factor 5) for survival. However, it was unknown whether interference with ATF5 function can prevent or promote regression/eradication of malignant gliomas in vivo. To address this issue, we created a mouse model by crossing a human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter-tetracycline transactivator mouse line with tetracycline operon-dominant negative-ATF5 (d/n-ATF5) mice to establish bi-transgenic mice. In this model, d/n-ATF5 expression is controlled by doxycycline and the promoter for GFAP, a marker for stem/progenitor cells as well as gliomas. Endogenous gliomas were produced with high efficiency by retroviral delivery of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B and p53-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in adult bi-transgenic mice in which expression of d/n-ATF5 was spatially and temporally regulated. Induction of d/n-ATF5 before delivery of PDGF-B/p53-shRNA virus greatly reduced the proportion of mice that formed tumors. Moreover, d/n-ATF5 induction after tumor formation led to regression/eradication of detectable gliomas without evident damage to normal brain cells in all 24 mice assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2033003216,"Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) have a central role in the modification of chromatin as well as in the pathogenesis of a broad set of diseases including cancers. Gcn5 is the first identified transcription-related HAT that has been implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular functions. However, how Gcn5 proteins are regulated remains largely unknown. Here we show that acidic nucleoplasmic DNA-binding protein (And-1, a high mobility group domain-containing protein) has remarkable capability to regulate the stability of Gcn5 proteins and thereby histone H3 acetylation. We find that And-1 forms a complex with both histone H3 and Gcn5. Downregulation of And-1 results in Gcn5 degradation, leading to the reduction of H3K9 and H3K56 acetylation. And-1 overexpression stabilizes Gcn5 through protein-protein interactions in vivo. Furthermore, And-1 expression is increased in cancer cells in a manner correlating with increased Gcn5 and H3K9Ac and H3K56Ac. Thus, our data reveal not only a functional link between Gcn5 and And-1 that is essential for Gcn5 protein stability and histone H3 acetylation, but also a potential role of And-1 in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2030512056,"Formation of amyloid fibrils is involved in a range of fatal human disorders including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and prion diseases. Yeast prions, despite differences in sequence from their mammalian counterparts, share similar features with mammalian prions including infectivity, prion strain phenomenon, and species barrier and thus are good model systems for human prion diseases. Yeast prions normally have long prion domains that presumably form multiple β strands in the fibril, and structural knowledge about the yeast prion fibrils has been limited. Here we use site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to investigate the structures of amyloid fibrils of Ure2 prion domain. We show that 15 spin-labeled Ure2 mutants, with spin labels at every 5th residue from position 5 to position 75, show a single-line or nearly single-line feature in their EPR spectra as a result of strong spin exchange interactions. These results suggest that a parallel in-register β structure exists at these spin-labeled positions. More interestingly, we also show that residues in the segment 30–65 have stronger spin exchange interactions, higher local stability, and lower solvent accessibility than segments 5–25 and 70–75, suggesting different local environment at these segments. We propose a hierarchical organization in the amyloid core of Ure2, with the segment 30–65 forming an inner core and the segments 5–25 and 70–75 forming an outer core.

Prions are infectious proteins that underlie the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in humans and other mammals. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. According to the protein-only hypothesis (1Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar), prions can undergo a conformational transition from a cellular form to a disease form, which is the agent that causes transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The disease form of prion can further serve as a template to convert the cellular form to the disease form, enabling prion propagation. Prions belong to a large class of amyloid-forming proteins involved in various human disorders such as Alzheimer disease and type II diabetes (3Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5137) Google Scholar). Amyloid is a fibrillar form of protein aggregates with some common characteristics such as staining with the dyes Congo red (4Puchtler H. Sweat F. Levine M. J. Histochem.

Therefore, yeast prions have been used as a model system to address questions such as the protein-only hypothesis of prion transmission, prion strains, and involvement of molecular chaperones in prion diseases. Ure2 protein is one of the best characterized prions in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10Wickner R.B. Masison D.C. Edskes H.K. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cellular function of Ure2 protein is to suppress the expression of enzymes and transporters involved in catabolizing poor nitrogen sources when a good nitrogen source is present (11Cooper T.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 223-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When Ure2 switches to its prion state, URE3, nitrogen catabolism genes for poor nitrogen sources are expressed even in the presence of a good nitrogen source (12Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The full-length Ure2 protein contains 354 amino acids. The N-terminal domain (residues 1–89) is the prion domain, and C-terminal domain (residues 90–354) is a globular domain that is necessary and sufficient for its cellular function (13Thual C.

Based on EPR studies, a parallel in-register β structural model has been suggested for the fibrils of Aβ (32Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol.

Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18946-18951Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), consistent with structural models based on solid-state NMR studies. In these studies the EPR spectra of spin-labeled amyloid proteins show a single-line feature, whereas normally the EPR spectrum of a spin-labeled protein has three spectral lines. The single-line spectrum is a result of strong spin exchange interactions between stacked spin labels in the fibril (24Margittai M. Langen R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 41: 265-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 39Molin Y.N. Salikhov K.M. Zamaraev K.I. Spin Exchange. Springer-Verlag, New York1980Crossref Google Scholar). This single-line feature is a convenient and powerful signature to identify the parallel in-register β structure in amyloids. With rapid development in the area of distance measurements ranging from 8 to 70 Å, EPR is capable of determining amyloid structures at a resolution of at least backbone fold. Solid-state NMR studies of Ure2 prion domain 13C-labeled at backbone carbonyl sites of Leu or Val residues or at the side-chain methyl sites of Ala residue show intermolecular 13C-13C distances of ≈5 Å (28Baxa U. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. Anderson D.E. Marekov L.N. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13149-13162Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This result is consistent only with a parallel in-register β-sheet structure. However, structural information was limited to eight residue positions at 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 43, 58, and 81, and only one residue at position 58 was investigated between residues 44 and 80. Solid-state NMR studies of a shorter Ure2 prion domain fragment including residues 10–39 also show a parallel in-register β structure (40Chan J.C. Oyler N.A. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10669-10680Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar solid-state NMR studies have been performed on yeast prions Sup35 and Rnq1 with 13C-labeled Tyr, Leu, Phe, or Ala residues (29Shewmaker F. Wickner R.B. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19754-19759Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 30Wickner R.B. Dyda F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and a parallel in-register β structure was proposed for both proteins. The parallel in-register structural model is also supported by mass per unit length measurements (41Chen B. Thurber K.R. Shewmaker F. Wickner R.B. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14339-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and sequence scrambling of prion domains (42Ross E.D. Baxa U. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7206-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the detailed packing of the amyloid core has been poorly understood regardless the existence of parallel in-register structure. In this work we use site-directed spin labeling and EPR to study the structure of fibrils formed by Ure2 prion domain. The general strategy of site-directed spin labeling is to introduce a cysteine residue at a selected site by site-directed mutagenesis. Then the cysteine residue is modified to generate a spin label side chain. The spin label used in this work is named R1 (supplemental Fig. S1). We show that a parallel in-register β structure exists at every 5th position from residue 5 to residue 75. Our results also show that residues 30–65 form an inner core with a different local environment from the outer core segments 5–25 and 70–75, suggesting a hierarchical organization in the amyloid core of Ure2 fibrils. The inner core residues may contribute to the overall stability of the fibril more than the outer core residues. Therefore, varying the size of the inner core may be a structural basis for amyloid polymorphism and prion strains, which have been shown to have different stabilities for yeast prions (43Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The construct of Ure2 prion domain was kindly provided by Dr. Susan Lindquist (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The details of this construct have been described previously (44Alberti S. Halfmann R. King O. Kapila A. Lindquist S. Cell. 2009; 137: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). For protein expression, the Ure2 construct was transformed into C41(DE3) cells (Lucigen) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when cells grew to an absorbance of A600 ≈ 0.6 at 37 °C. The induction was allowed to proceed at 28 °C for 4–6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PSU buffer (50 mm phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 8 m urea, pH 8.0). The cells were then sonicated, and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered using 0.45-μm filter (Whatman) and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PSU buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (50–500 mm) in 10 column volumes. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.97 × 103 m−1 cm−1 (45Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). For spin labeling, dithiothreitol was added to protein solution and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 20 min to break any disulfide bonds and then was removed with a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare). For spin labeling, MTSSL 2The abbreviations used are: MTSSL(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonateGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideNiEDDANi(II) ethylenediaminediacetic acid. (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate; Enzo Life Sciences) was added at 10× molar excess immediately after dithiothreitol treatment and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on the spin-labeled proteins to ensure that the mass was correct and the extent of spin labeling was more than 95%. After spin labeling, proteins were precipitated with methanol, air-dried, and stored at −80 °C. (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate guanidine hydrochloride Ni(II) ethylenediaminediacetic acid. Proteins precipitated by methanol were first dissolved in 15 mm sodium phosphate, 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 6.8, to a concentration of 1 mm. To start fibril formation, proteins were diluted 20-fold to PBS buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). For the quiescent condition, the sample was left on the bench at room temperature (∼22 °C). For the agitated condition, the sample was continuously shaken at 1200 rpm at room temperature. The process of fibril formation was monitored with thioflavin T binding. For electron microscopy, fibril samples were applied onto glow-discharged copper grids covered with 400 mesh Formvar/carbon film (Ted Pella) and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were examined under a JEOL JEM-1200EX electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. For a Congo red binding assay, Congo red (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS and filtered with 0.22-μm filter. The concentration of Congo red solution was determined using an extinction coefficient of 3.7 × 104 m−1cm−1 at 498 nm. The final concentration of protein was 5 μm in the presence of 9 μm Congo red. After incubating at room temperature for 20 min, a wavelength scan of the absorbance was performed on a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer. For thioflavin T binding assay, thioflavin T (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS and filtered with a 0.22-μm filter. Proteins were diluted to a final concentration of 1 μm in PBS containing 50 μm thioflavin T. A fluorescence scan was performed immediately on a JASCO FP-6200 spectrofluorometer. Excitation was at 440 nm (5-nm slit width), and emission was scanned from 460 to 650 nm (5-nm slit width). EPR measurements were performed at X-band frequency on a Bruker EMX spectrometer fitted with the ER4102ST cavity at room temperature using a microwave power of 20 milliwatts and a modulation amplitude optimized to the natural line width of each individual spectrum. For 20 and 100% labeled fibrils, the modulation amplitude was ∼2 and 4 gauss, respectively. Fibril samples were collected using Amicon Ultra filter with a 100-kDa cutoff (Millipore) and were placed in glass capillaries (VitroCom) sealed at one end. EPR spectra in each figure panel were normalized to the same number of spins. Subtraction of mobile component was performed as previously described (46Langen R. Cai K. Altenbach C. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7918-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mobile spectrum was simulated and subtracted from original spectrum using a LabVIEW program. The fraction of the mobile component, hyperfine splitting, and line width was adjusted to match the mobile component in the experimental spectrum. We estimate that the error in the fraction of the mobile component is ±10% that of the reported value. For spectral simulations, experimental EPR spectra were simulated using a LabVIEW (National Instruments) interface (47McCoy J. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) of the program NLSL developed by Freed and co-workers (48Schneider D.J. Freed J.H. Berliner L.J. Reuben J. Spin Labeling: Theory and Applications. Plenum Press, New York1989: 1-76Google Scholar, 49Budil D.E. Lee S. Saxena S. Freed J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 120: 155-189Crossref Scopus (803) Google Scholar). A microscopic order macroscopic disorder (MOMD) model was used as previously described (49Budil D.E. Lee S. Saxena S. Freed J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 120: 155-189Crossref Scopus (803) Google Scholar). A least-squares fit of the user-defined spectral parameters was performed on the experimental spectra using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The values of the A and g magnetic tensors were fixed as Axx = 6.2, Ayy = 5.9, and Azz = 37.0, and gxx = 2.0078, gyy = 2.0058, and gzz = 2.0022, which were determined previously for R1 (50Columbus L. Kálai T. Jekö J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3828-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Each EPR spectrum was assumed to contain one spectral component corresponding to one spin label state. The number of fitted parameters was kept at a minimum, which in this work includes the isotropic rotational diffusion constant (R) and Heisenberg exchange frequency (ω). We found that satisfactory fits were obtained with only these two parameters. Rotational correlation time (τ) can be calculated using τ = 1/(6R). Values of τ and ω are reported in supplemental Table S1. Error for exchange frequency was estimated by changing the value from its best fit until a significant deviation in simulated spectra was observed. The error was plotted in Fig. 4 as error bars. The correlation time at different labeling sites has a narrow range of 5–7 ns, which is comparable with buried sites in model proteins such as T4 lysozyme. Previous studies have found that the correlation time is ∼4–5 ns for buried sites 118 and 131 in T4 lysozyme (51Guo Z. Cascio D. Hideg K. Kálái T. Hubbell W.L. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1069-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In T4 lysozyme, the motion of the spin label at buried sites is highly ordered (51Guo Z. Cascio D. Hideg K. Kálái T. Hubbell W.L. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1069-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also performed simulations with an anisotropic model by including an order parameter. For anisotropic simulations, diffusion tilt angles were fixed to (α,β,γ) = (0,36°,0) for z axis anisotropy as previously reported (50Columbus L. Kálai T. Jekö J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3828-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The diffusion tilt angels are the Euler angles relating the axes of the diffusion tensor and the magnetic tensor. We found that the fitted exchange frequency using anisotropic model is extremely similar to those obtained with isotropic model. Therefore, only parameters from isotropic models are reported here. For guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) treatment experiments, fibrils formed with only spin-labeled Ure2 proteins were collected and then mixed with PBS buffer containing 7 m GdnHCl to obtain the desired GdnHCl concentration. We found that dissociation of monomers from fibrils in the presence of GdnHCl reaches equilibrium within half an hour. To estimate the extent of monomer dissociation, we compare the center line amplitude of the EPR spectrum normalized to the same number of spins because the center line amplitude faithfully report the dissociation event in the presence of GdnHCl (Fig. 5B). Another possible analysis of monomer dissociation is to separate the mobile spectrum from the fibril spectrum, but we found this analysis is more prone to errors than using amplitude. The protein concentration in the final fibril sample was kept within 30% of one another based on the A280 nm value of the solution after fibril formation. Our analysis shows that protein concentration variations by 30% in the presence of 3 m GdnHCl do not significantly change the center line amplitude. For solvent accessibility measurements with Ni(II) ethylenediaminediacetic acid (NiEDDA), EPR spectra of 20% labeled fibril samples were measured in the presence of 30 mm NiEDDA. The NiEDDA-broadened EPR spectrum was fitted as a convolution of the EPR spectrum in the absence of NiEDDA and a Lorentzian broadening function as previously described (52Altenbach C. Froncisz W. Hemker R. McHaourab H. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 2103-2112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Collision frequency with NiEDDA is obtained from fitting. The factors that affect this fitting procedure contribute to the error of measurement. These factors include the signal-to-noise of the EPR spectrum, goodness of fit to the Lorentzian broadening function, and accuracy of NiEDDA concentration. Because it is difficult to estimate the contribution to measurement error from each individual factor, S.D. from two independent measurements were reported in Fig. 6 as error bars. These errors are generally less than 5% that of the reported value. The construct of Ure2 prion domain (residues 1–89) in this work has the M domain (residues 124–253) of yeast prion protein Sup35 attached to the C terminus (44Alberti S. Halfmann R. King O. Kapila A. Lindquist S. Cell. 2009; 137: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) and is designated as Ure2p1–89-M here. The purpose of Sup35 M domain is to increase the solubility of Ure2 prion domain during sample preparation. Previous studies have shown that attachment of Sup35 M domain to various yeast prion domains, including Ure2, has no apparent effects on the amyloid formation (44Alberti S. Halfmann R. King O. Kapila A. Lindquist S. Cell. 2009; 137: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 53Osherovich L.Z. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Weissman J.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E86Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy shows that under quiescent conditions, Ure2p1–89-M forms elongated unbranched filaments, with an average width of ∼12 nm (Fig. 1A). Under agitated condition (i.e. continuous shaking at 1200 rpm), Ure2p1–89-M forms short fibrils with lengths between ∼15 and 100 nm, and the width is similar to quiescent fibrils (Fig. 1A). The morphology of agitated fibrils could result from mechanical fragmentation of long fibrils, increased nucleation rate as a result of agitation, or different polymorphic structures. The quiescent fibrils bind Congo red, leading to a red shift of the absorption spectrum (Fig. 1B) and also bind thioflavin T, giving rise to a characteristic emission peak at ∼482 nm (Fig. 1C). The agitated fibrils have similar binding properties to Congo red and thioflavin T. Therefore, we conclude Ure2p1–89-M forms fibrils with amyloid properties. To investigate the structure of Ure2 fibrils, we introduced spin labels, 1 at a time, at every 5th residue from position 5 to position 80. Supplemental Fig. S2 shows the amino acid sequence of the Ure2 prion domain together with the positions for spin labeling. Electron microscopy shows that spin-labeled Ure2p1–89-M proteins form similar fibrils to wild type proteins (Fig. 2). We also performed fibril formation on 20% labeled samples, in which spin-labeled Ure2 is mixed with wild type Ure2 at a 1:4 ratio. The fibrils of 20% labeled samples are similar to 100% labeled samples (Fig. 2), suggesting that spin-labeled Ure2 can form fibrils interchangeably with wild type proteins. All the fibrils bind to thioflavin T. Fibrils formed under different conditions may have different underlying structures (43Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 54Petkova A.T. Leapman R.D. Guo Z. Yau W.M. Mattson M.P. Tycko R. Science. 2005; 307: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the Ure2 fibrils formed under quiescent and agitated conditions have the same molecular structure. In this work we arbitrarily choose to study the structure of the fibrils formed under agitated conditions with EPR spectroscopy. Normally spin-labeled proteins give rise to EPR spectra with three spectral lines. In a parallel in-register β structure, each position in one protein stacks upon the same position in the adjacent protein. When the fibrils are formed by proteins spin-labeled at a specific site, the parallel in-register structure results in the stacking of spin labels in the fibrils. The stacked spin labe"

We discuss the implications of these changes for pharmaceutical companies and the opportunities they offer to a new entrepreneur. The cell therapy branch of the regenerative medicine field has been innovative in developing new models of delivery and development and identifying alternative sources of funding. We discuss the implications of these changes for pharmaceutical companies and the opportunities they offer to a new entrepreneur. Regenerative medicine, and cell therapy in particular, is often hailed for its potential to revolutionize modern medicine, and the world seems impatient for news of both clinical efficacy and commercial success (Lysaght et al., 2008Lysaght M.J. Jaklenec A. Deweerd E. Tissue Eng. Part A. 2008; 14: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). While research progresses, an increasing awareness that established drug development and sales models are not suited to many aspects of cell therapy leaves the field looking for alternative commercial paradigms (McKernan et al., 2010McKernan R. McNeish J. Smith D. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). By examining the disconnect between modern cell therapies and standard, centralized distribution mechanisms, an entrepreneur may find new routes to bring treatments into mainstream patient care. Cell therapy in the form of bone marrow transplant has been conducted for decades. This predominantly “point of care” treatment is delivered by physicians and hospitals with little commercial involvement. In contrast, fibroblasts and skin-based products have been sold commercially for years, primarily as a manufactured cell-based therapy supplied by biotechnology companies. In the last 20 years, the lines between these models have shifted, with, for example, the expansion of private cord blood banking, the use of more differentiated blood cell populations for immunotherapy, and the evaluation and commercialization of nonhematopoietic fractions of marrow for use in wound healing, cardiac repair, and vasculogenesis. Other typically discarded blood products, such as red blood cells, autologous sera, and platelet rich plasma (PRP), may offer new sources of riches (Brown and Kraft, 2006Brown N. Kraft A. Technol. Anal. Strateg. Manage. 2006; 18: 313-327Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a commercially attractive nonhematopoietic source material due to their relative abundance and potential for long-term in vitro expansion. While their precise differentiation potential remains debated, MSCs and MSC-like cells offer therapeutic potential via their trophic and immune modulatory activities (see Caplan and Correa, 2011Caplan A. Correa D. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9 (this issue): 11-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, this issue). Even more recently, a candidate blood-vessel-forming stem cell has been identified, and companies have been formed to try and leverage the utility of this population (Angioblast Systems, Inc; Mesoblast Ltd). In the neural field, stem and progenitor cells have been sourced from fetal tissue, which clearly is not predisposed to an industrial scale. However, the development of protocols to derive neural stem cells (NSCs) and their progeny from pluripotent stem cells has opened new commercial doors. Geron and ACT are two examples of companies that have approved investigational new drug applications (INDs) that are currently enrolling patients. Within the induced pluripotent stem cell space, the rapid pace of discovery that brought nonintegrative, high-efficiency reprogramming strategies, GMP compliant methods, and protocols for directed differentiation has made the idea of personalized medicine more real, though it remains a long way off. The short-term commercial potential offered by these advances will likely be based in drug discovery and toxicity testing, as discussed below. The current revival of gene therapy brings an additional dimension to the evolution of commercial cell therapies. Previously hampered by issues with random integration and challenges in achieving localized tissue delivery, pluripotent cells can now be readily engineered and differentiated to yield cells with specific homing properties, which opens the door to ex vivo gene therapy coupled with cell transplants. A few brave pioneers, including researchers at the New York Stem Cell Foundation, have begun testing such efforts. Both Europe and the US have responded to the evolving landscape with new regulatory paradigms for cell therapy (Fink, 2009Fink Jr., D.W. Science. 2009; 324: 1662-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Broadly, the FDA differentiates between minimally manipulated, autologous cells used for a homologous function and those that are manufactured or used in a nonhomologous manner, with the former needing to satisfy fewer and simpler rules. Such regulatory distinctions influence the design of commercial activity, in particular by broadly dividing the field into autologous and allogeneic efforts. MSC-based therapies fall into both domains, and NSCs are probably the closest to the market in the allogeneic domain. However, the pace of research—particularly in the pluripotent cell sphere—has forced companies to reevaluate their business models. Historically, development of new therapies has occurred in industry, typically led by big pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. In the classic model, a university's technology transfer department helps patent an academic's invention and license it to potential early investors. Experienced investors can forecast the cost of taking a therapy to market and can evaluate the risk associated with a given process. In the US, universities and the government share invention revenues with the inventor, providing incentive for innovation. Moreover, an active, relatively profitable pharmaceutical industry with the infrastructure to navigate regulatory, marketing, and reimbursement channels offers inventors and small companies several exit strategies to avoid having to incur the cost of commercialization. Following this model, new drugs cost somewhere between $200M to $1 billion to develop, take 10–15 years to get to market, and have the potential to generate several billions of dollars in sales. Perhaps one in ten promising drug candidates will pass regulatory approval, and thus companies expect a certain timeline of exclusivity based on patent protection in order to offset both the risk and their development costs. This small molecule drug development model has been successfully adapted to biologics, and while there have been attempts to apply this framework to cell therapy, a number of issues suggest that new paradigms are needed. Indeed, despite its historical success, it is unclear if the standard model is sustainable even for ongoing small molecule drug development. Costs for drug development have risen faster than inflation, success rates have fallen and the number of late stage failures has risen, all of which make the process less viable. Governments faced with rising healthcare costs and an aging population are unwilling to subsidize the research effort, and payers are unwilling to shoulder the high cost of a new medication for only marginal improvement over existing therapy. Indeed, the ongoing pharma evolution is likely a result of a failure of this model in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. Considering that cell therapies offer a host of new practical challenges relative to small molecule drug candidates, it seems reasonable to predict that adapting this model to regenerative medicine will not work. There are several reasons why cell-based therapy will likely be developed under a new commercial paradigm, not the least of which is because most pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to adopt cells as an alternative to small molecules. This decision is in large part a practical matter, given that standard small molecule manufacturing facilities cannot be adapted to cell production. Even the manufacture of biologics, which do involve cell culture, is designed to save the supernatant and discard the cells, and the effort required to convert existing bioreactor technology to reverse this process is difficult. Even if the cell therapy products could be produced, the animal models designed to test the efficacy of small molecules are different, and modeling cell based therapy tends to have added requirements for followup, safety, and analysis. Likewise, standard clinical studies require major modifications, since while a drug has a definite half-life and likely functions similarly in vitro and in vivo, cell fates vary in different contexts, and transplanted stem cells may persist for years, or even a lifetime. Similarly, strategies to avoid immune reactions to antibodies and growth factors are relatively clear-cut, but these solutions are not applicable to cell-based therapy, which is more akin to organ transplantation. Expertise therefore lies with clinicians and hospitals rather than pharmaceutical companies. While these specific traits that distinguish cell-based therapy from more conventional drug development are equally problematic for other cell therapy practitioners, large pharmaceutical companies exhibit strong reluctance to change what works, given the huge overhead outlay required to make such changes. Indeed, as pharmaceutical companies slowly begin to move toward cell therapy, they are abandoning old processes and adopting novel methodologies. Beyond the question of pharma's willingness to adapt their development strategy and manufacturing infrastructure, the partnership between universities, tech transfer, and investors is not as robust as it was for small molecule development. Large venture capital firms have also been reluctant to fund cell-based therapy companies. In general, venture capitalists calculate the potential return on their investment, the time it will take to get that potential return, and the risk related to that return. A higher risk can be justified if the return is larger and the timeline to return short. Conversely, less money will be placed at risk if the timeline is longer or the perceived risk is higher. In the minds of most investors, cell therapy has a long timeline to a potential return, and the field is too young to reliably predict which candidates will be blockbusters. Furthermore, the next wave of stem cell therapies may only offer incremental improvements over existing options. In addition to the scientific risk in investing in a new cellular product, there are also ethical risks associated with the public divide on pluripotent cell-based therapy, and the resulting political risk and uncertainty that stems from a lack of global harmonization with respect to regulatory oversight (Harvey, 2009Harvey O. Politics and Policy. 2009; 37: 51-71Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, Bergman and Graff, 2007Bergman K. Graff G.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Given that other opportunities with lower risk and higher predicted return are available, venture capitalists will therefore allocate less capital to this field and invest elsewhere. It is worth noting that these arguments are not theoretical and clearly have affected money inflows. Virtually all major NIH funding has gone to adult stem cells or non-ESC based therapies, which carry less ethical, political, and scientific risk, or has gone to fund alternate uses (nontherapeutic uses of cells) such as discovery or screening models or toxicological applications. The question of novel infrastructure needed for the manufacture of cell therapy products is most relevant for models that involve allogeneic cell sources. Autologous products, or even minimally manipulated allogenic cells, will likely fall under a distributed or personalized therapy model. In contrast, pharmaceutical companies typically utilize a centralized distribution model in which the standardized product is generated in bulk and supplied in batches to medical providers. As mentioned above, the regulations that will apply to this approach are still not clear. In addition to more straightforward regulatory oversight, the personalized distributed model can often deliver therapy that may be quicker to develop, and therefore cheaper per unit dose (Enserink, 2006Enserink M. Science. 2006; 313: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an autologous model may be perceived as better, since one's own cells are being used for therapy. Nonetheless, distributed models may be harder to commercialize, at least in a traditional, scalable way. One compromise approach has investors focus on a smaller subset of adult cell-based therapies that carry few political and ethical risks, and can be adopted to large-scale bioreactor manufacturing. Indeed, a quick sampling of successfully funded cell-based companies reveals that MSC-based companies such as Osiris, Athersys, Mesoblast, and Stempeutics dominate the market. Another alternative is for companies to utilize cells for discovery and other ancillary activities like tool or reagent development. For example, companies such as CDI, Iperian, and FATE are all based on discovery or toxicological assays, and have been remarkably successful in raising funds. Interestingly, tool and reagent companies that provide key resources for cell-based discovery and therapeutics have also been quite successful in the marketplace, though not as successful in raising investment money, perhaps because this sort of venture does not typically generate a high return on investment. Nevertheless, these smaller tool and reagent companies promote rapid dissemination of technology and provide a means of standardization globally. Close to a dozen small tool and technology companies that offer iPSC-related reagents have been formed in the last 2 years in California alone. Any organization developing a new discovery, whether pharma, venture capital firms, or even academic spin-offs, will need to navigate a complex patent landscape. From a stem cell perspective, this space is even more complicated because several countries have deemed that human ESCs and pluripotent cells cannot be patented. Given that industry is global and any treatment can be administered anywhere, it has become hard to determine how and when to protect intellectual property. Furthermore, patents require a specifically defined product, such as an exact chemical formula, a precise mass spec signature, or a defined sequence. Cells do not fall into such neat definitions. Cells change in response to the environment and many distinct cell populations may have similar functions in vivo (see for example the multiplicity of MSC types). This issue has created extreme difficulty in obtaining either exclusivity or first mover advantage and has been a factor that has inhibited investment in the field. The wonderful thing about capitalism is that opportunity leads to entrepreneurship, and often to successful new business models. Profitable cell therapy-based businesses have been developed in a variety of ways. For example, in the absence of venture funding and the relative dearth of tools and reagents, government agencies such as the NIH and state governments have stepped in to provide support, with California leading the way. Viacyte, a pancreatic islet-based therapeutic company, received grants in the form of loans from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). This funding is nondilutive; CIRM does not receive a fraction of ownership in return for their capital, which leaves Viacyte with more ownership available to attract venture investors. Meanwhile, NIH's orphan disease program fills a critical niche (Freeman et al., 2010Freeman S.N. Burke K.A. Imoisili M.A. Coté T.R. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 283-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), in part through the PACT program that has supplied GMP-grade cells to many early innovators. In the absence of public or government support of public banking, cord blood companies have developed a hybrid model of private/public banking that has allowed them to thrive and make an otherwise discarded cell population available for potential therapeutic use. These companies developed a subscription model with a storage fee that has become a viable biorepository model for processing and storage of other cell types. Hospitals and private physician groups have established personalized medicine clinics that offer a range of cells for a variety of uses. Such clinics are legal but not well regulated and are often prone to wild claims (Lau et al., 2008Lau D. Ogbogu U. Taylor B. Stafinski T. Menon D. Caulfield T. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Others, however, are quite reputable and provide important services. These clinics are largely self-funded, and given their rapid spread, are likely quite profitable. Some of the larger clinics have now begun trials and funded studies to verify their claims, and are therefore contributing, albeit to a small extent, to the scientific database. Some hospitals have set up stem cell laboratories that provide clinical-grade cells processed on site by experienced and trained personnel for marrow, orthopedic, and immunotherapy applications. Device companies have partnered with hospitals to fund trials and develop customized devices for these procedures. Thermogeneis, Harvest, Stryker, and Caridian are examples of companies that have undertaken this sort of interaction. Other, braver companies have begun examining if a modified version of personalized therapy can be combined with a centralized processing facility to provide therapy that would be subject to more extensive regulation than a purely autologous, distributed model. Carticell from Genzyme is one such example. More recently, however, other companies have been able to both raise capital and develop a product. Aastrom, for example, collects marrow-derived tissue repair cells (TRCs) from a patient and transfers them to a central site for a multiple-week processing period, after which the cells are returned to a hospital site to treat the patient's critical limb ischemia. While these models have allowed some companies to bypass the need for funding from traditional sources, other ventures have sought public investment, because their capital requirements were too large to rely on government largess alone, and the specific application was considered too long-term or too high-risk for venture capitalists, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies. These companies managed to tap the public enthusiasm for stem cells and their therapeutic potential. Early-stage companies who otherwise would not have been considered viable initial public offering (IPO) candidates have been able to go public, thus bypassing several stages of private investment. Some companies have been even more creative and have used reverse mergers as a “backdoor” alternative to going public. In this case, a privately held company merges with an existing, but essentially inactive publicly traded company. Thus, the private company can become public without the usual costs, time, and scrutiny that are typically involved. There is a long list of such reverse mergers (Neostem, Stem Cell Inc., etc), which give small, capital-starved companies access to the market. I expect this trend will continue into the foreseeable future. Although there is no prescription for success, there are several critical stages at which specific decisions can influence the outcome of your venture. Perhaps the earliest decision point is whether or not to patent your idea. Patents are very powerful and provide a clear method of valuation. On the other hand, patents are expensive, have to be published, and can often be bypassed. Prosecuting them worldwide is difficult and the regulations governing stem cells vary country to country, making it difficult to get global coverage in what is now a global economy. Protecting something as a trade secret may be an alternative in the cell therapy space. A second important decision is when to set up a company and begin the process of commercialization. My experience suggests that most inventors tend to commercialize too early and, as a result, lose control over their invention and find their ownership diluted as they sell progressively more of the company to investors to generate the requisite capital. Nondilutive financing such as research grants, support from your parent institution, government funding in the form of small business innovation research grants (SBIRs) and small business technology transfer programs (STTRs), and even support from other small companies in the form of cross licensing, space, and shared resources can be important to success. The further you can develop your idea, the lower the risk for venture capitalists, the shorter the time to return on their equity investment, and therefore the higher the price they are willing to pay. There is of course the corresponding issue of how can you develop an idea or a therapy at the early stage without forming a company, and this is an issue that is being actively explored. Universities are increasingly functioning as partners and building bioparks to allow investigators to begin work while retaining academic appointments. Technology transfer offices are working with angel investors to provide funding, and several public-private partnerships between foundations and companies have sprung up to help this early-stage effort without diluting ownership. Tapping into these nascent strategies requires work, but it is well worth the effort in the long run. Choose your investment partner wisely as they need to either have deep pockets or additional partners on tap for the inevitable additional rounds of financing one may need. In general, finding an investment partner who brings more than just money to the table is often of greater value than someone with deep pockets alone. The partner may bring management expertise, technical expertise (such as within an investment arm of pharma or via a stable of companies in a large venture fund), or complimentary know-how. Think globally, as the market and competition are now global (Salter et al., 2006Salter B. Cooper M. Dickins A. Regen. Med. 2006; 1: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Salter et al., 2007Salter B. Cooper M. Dickins A. Cardo V. Regen. Med. 2007; 2: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and indeed at least in the stem cell field, atypical sources of funding have to be considered. For example, several small companies have looked to India, simply because there are hospital partners who are willing to invest and help run clinical trials for cell-based therapy. Others are looking to establish offices in California to access resources there and tap American markets. Access information, and use available resources. There are numerous sources of information and many experts and it is important to both collect such information and sift through it to identify key issues in this rapidly changing field. New information may make your model obsolete, may identify new competition or a key technology that is a must-have, or may become available to accelerate your efforts. It does not matter what it is—information is crucial in making considered decisions, and an investigator/entrepreneur cannot ignore the outside world while focusing on the invention itself. Although there are many hurdles to being a successful entrepreneur in the field of cell-based applications, it is nevertheless very possible. The field is large and growing. Many different models have been successful and creative pioneers have shown what can work, and equally importantly, what does not. One can choose to learn from the experience of others, and with a careful detailed plan, one can succeed."
https://openalex.org/W2035229948,"Replication-dependent histone gene expression is a fundamental process occurring in S-phase under the control of the cyclin-E/CDK2 complex. This process is regulated by a number of proteins, including Flice-Associated Huge Protein (FLASH) (CASP8AP2), concentrated in specific nuclear organelles known as HLBs. FLASH regulates both histone gene transcription and mRNA maturation, and its downregulation in vitro results in the depletion of the histone pull and cell-cycle arrest in S-phase. Here we show that the transcription factor p73 binds to FLASH and is part of the complex that regulates histone gene transcription. Moreover, we created a novel gene trap to disrupt FLASH in mice, and we show that homozygous deletion of FLASH results in early embryonic lethality, owing to arrest of FLASH(-/-) embryos at the morula stage. These results indicate that FLASH is an essential, non-redundant regulator of histone transcription and cell cycle during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2038202279,"Multiple SRC-family kinases (SFKs) are commonly activated in carcinoma and appear to have a role in metastasis through incompletely understood mechanisms. Recent studies have shown that CDCP1 (CUB (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1) Domain-Containing Protein-1) is a transmembrane protein and an SRC substrate potentially involved in metastasis. Here we show that increased SFK and CDCP1 tyrosine phosphorylation is, surprisingly, associated with a decrease in FAK phosphorylation. This appears to be true in human tumors as shown by our correlation analysis of a mass spectrometric data set of affinity-purified phosphotyrosine peptides obtained from normal and cancer lung tissue samples. Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 in cell culture, including by a mAb that binds to its extracellular domain, promoted changes in SFK and FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as in PKC(TM), a protein known to associate with CDCP1, and these changes are accompanied by increases in adhesion and motility. Thus, signaling events that accompany the CDCP1 tyrosine phosphorylation observed in cell lines and human lung tumors may explain how the CDCP1/SFK complex regulates motility and adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2080884181,"We have recently shown that the adaptor protein p140Cap regulates tumor properties in terms of cell motility and growth. Here, by using the highly metastatic rat adenocarcinoma cell line MTLn3-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we assess the role of p140Cap in metastasis formation. Orthotopic transplantation of MTLn3-EGFR cells over-expressing p140Cap in Rag2−/−γc−/− mice resulted in normal primary tumor growth compared with the controls. Strikingly, p140Cap over-expression causes an 80% inhibition in the number of lung metastases. p140Cap over-expressing cells display a 50% reduction in directional cell migration, an increased number and size of focal adhesions, and a strong impairment in the ability to invade in a 3D matrix. p140Cap over-expression affects EGFR signaling and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in response to EGF stimulation. Intriguingly, p140Cap associates with cortactin via interaction with its second proline-rich domain to the cortactin SH3 domain. The phosphomimetic cortactin tyrosine 421 mutant rescues migration and invasive properties in p140Cap over-expressing cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that p140Cap suppresses the invasive properties of highly metastatic breast carcinoma cells by inhibiting cortactin-dependent cell motility."

In contrast to complete amino acid sequence conservation in the AR DNA and ligand binding domains among mammals, a primate-specific difference in the AR NH2-terminal region that regulates the NH2- and carboxyl-terminal (N/C) interaction enables direct binding to melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-11), an AR coregulator that is also primate-specific. Human, mouse, and rat AR share the same NH2-terminal 23FQNLF27 sequence that mediates the androgen-dependent N/C interaction. However, the mouse and rat AR FXXLF motif is flanked by Ala33 that evolved to Val33 in primates. Human AR Val33 was required to interact directly with MAGE-11 and for the inhibitory effect of the AR N/C interaction on activation function 2 that was relieved by MAGE-11. The functional importance of MAGE-11 was indicated by decreased human AR regulation of an androgen-dependent endogenous gene using lentivirus short hairpin RNAs and by the greater transcriptional strength of human compared with mouse AR.

AR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor activated by binding testosterone, a major circulating male steroid hormone, or by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the more potent 5α-reduced metabolite of testosterone. Evolution of AR among mammals is characterized by complete amino acid sequence conservation in the central DNA binding domain that interacts with androgen response element DNA and in the carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain that binds androgens with high affinity and specificity (1Choong C.S. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Strict sequence conservation in these regions reflects the rigid structural requirements for DNA and hormone binding. In contrast, the AR NH2-terminal region, although also required for AR transcriptional activity, is largely unstructured and less well conserved (2Lavery D.N. McEwan I.J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3360-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The human AR NH2-terminal region contains activation function 1 (AF1) between amino acid residues 142–337 (3Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) preceded by a polymorphic CAG-encoded glutamine repeat that expanded during primate evolution (1Choong C.S. Kemppainen J.A.

The human MAGE-11 amino acid sequence was compared with the NCBI BLAST Assembled RefSeq Database for human, Rhesus macaque, mouse and rat genomes. We obtained no experimental evidence for human MAGE-11 isoform B indicated by the human genome database. The Clontech Mate and Plate yeast two-hybrid screen was performed by preparing mouse testis complementary DNA (cDNA) pool using SMART cDNA synthesis technology, recombination with Matchmaker prey vector pGADT7-Rec, and transformation in yeast strain Y187. Two independent screens of 2 × 108 colonies of a mouse testis library were performed using GAL-mAR-(4–52) or GAL-mAR-(2–285) as bait in yeast strain Y2HGold. Selection parameters included resistance to aureobasidin A, X-α-Gal blue colony formation, and growth in the absence of histidine or adenine. Screening using GAL-mAR-(4–52) as bait yielded 11 positive independent clones compared with 17 positive independent clones using GAL-mAR-(2–285) as bait. None of the identified protein interactions with mouse AR were FXXLF motif-dependent. LAPC-4 human prostate cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Cellgro), 1 nm R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen).
