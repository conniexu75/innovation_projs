https://openalex.org/W4311180726,"After the 2008 financial crisis, under the double effects of enterprise value maximization and the decline of real economy marginal profit, the relationship between enterprise financialization and technological innovation is worth exploring in depth. On the basis of testing the impact of non-financial enterprise financialization on technological innovation, this paper explores the impact mechanism as well as the heterogeneity among different types of enterprises. This paper selects non-financial listed enterprises in China from 2007 to 2017 as samples to study the influence of enterprise financialization on technological innovation and its mechanism through panel regression and mediating effect models. Moreover, the heterogeneity among different types of enterprises is further studied. The main conclusions are as follows. First, the financialization of enterprises has a significant ""crowding out"" effect on technological innovation. Second, the ""crowding out"" effect of enterprise financialization on technological innovation is formed through capital structure rather than performance. Third, enterprises are faced with different attributes and external environment, thus the influence of financialization on technological innovation is heterogeneous. Fourth, there are significant differences in the impact of financialization on technological innovation between enterprises' attributes and the external environment they face, and the deviation degree caused by attributes is much greater than that caused by the external environment."

Despite the availability of various vaccines, this study was conducted to better understand the factors behind individuals refusing to get vaccinated.The current cross-sectional study was conducted with individuals above 18 years of age in Shiraz, Iran, who were eligible but refused to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. Demographic features and factors related to their hesitancy and willingness to participate in the vaccination program were recorded in a questionnaire.Out of 801 participants in the current study, 427 (53.3%) were men, with a mean age of 37.92 years (± 14.16). The findings revealed that 350 (43.7%) participants claimed the side effects of the vaccine outweigh the benefits as one reason for their reluctance toward COVID-19 vaccination, followed by the unknown efficacy of vaccines (40.4%) and a lack of trust in vaccine companies (32.8%). Ensuring the safety of the vaccine (43.7%) and verifying its effectiveness (34.5%) were the most prevalent factors behind participating in the vaccination program. Those who reported their socio-economic status as low were significantly reluctant toward vaccination because of a self-presumption of high immunity (p-value < 0.001), the unclear efficacy of vaccines (p-value < 0.001), the side effects outweighing the benefits of vaccines (p-value < 0.001), distrust of vaccine companies (p-value < 0.001), usage of mask, gloves, and sanitizers (p-value < 0.001), contradictory speech of health authorities regarding vaccines (p-value = 0.041), and the unavailability of trusted vaccines (p-value = 0.002). It should also be noted that participants reported a greater likelihood to obtain information about vaccination reluctance from family and friends (p-value <0.001) and complementary medicine professionals (p-value <0.001).Avoiding vaccination is an undeniable public and individual health concern in Iran, as demonstrated in the current study. Concern about vaccine efficacy and side effects is the most reported cause of vaccination reluctance among individuals, which could be altered by emphasizing mass education and averting an infodemic by forming dedicated multidisciplinary organizations."
https://openalex.org/W4311180469,"The Ricin toxin A chain (RTA), which depurinates an adenine base at a specific region of the ribosome leading to death, has two adjacent specificity pockets in its active site. Based on this structural information, many attempts have been made to develop small-molecule RTA inhibitors that simultaneously block the two pockets. However, no attempt has been successful. In the present study, we synthesized pterin-7-carboxamides with tripeptide pendants and found that one of them interacts with both pockets simultaneously to exhibit good RTA inhibitory activity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the RTA crystal with the new inhibitor revealed that the conformational change of Tyr80 is an important factor that allows the inhibitors to plug the two pockets simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W4311116292,"In fragile X syndrome (FX), the leading monogenic cause of autism, excessive neuronal protein synthesis is a core pathophysiology; however, an overall increase in protein expression is not observed. Here, we tested whether excessive protein synthesis drives a compensatory rise in protein degradation that is protective for FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) neurons. Surprisingly, although we find a significant increase in protein degradation through ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), this contributes to pathological changes. Normalizing proteasome activity with bortezomib corrects excessive hippocampal protein synthesis and hyperactivation of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in response to auditory stimulation. Moreover, systemic administration of bortezomib significantly reduces the incidence and severity of audiogenic seizures (AGS) in the Fmr1-/y mouse, as does genetic reduction of proteasome, specifically in the IC. Together, these results identify excessive activation of the UPS pathway in Fmr1-/y neurons as a contributor to multiple phenotypes that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4311180312,"Obesity is a significant risk factor for several chronic non-communicable diseases, being closely related to Diabetes Mellitus . Computer modeling techniques favor the understanding of interaction mechanisms between specific targets and substances of interest, optimizing drug development. In this article, the protocol of two protocols of systematic reviews are described for identifying therapeutic targets and models for treating obesity or diabetes mellitus investigated in silico . The protocol is by the guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes Protocols (PRISMA-P) and was published in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (PROSPERO: CRD42022353808). Search strategies will be developed based on the combination of descriptors and executed in the following databases: PubMed; ScienceDirect; Scopus; Web of Science; Virtual Health Library; EMBASE. Only original in silico studies with molecular dynamics, molecular docking, or both will be inserted. Two trained researchers will independently select the articles, extract the data, and assess the risk of bias. The quality will be assessed through an adapted version of the Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) and the risk of bias using a checklist obtained from separate literature sources. The implementation of this protocol will result in the elaboration of two systematic reviews identifying the therapeutic targets for treating obesity (review 1) or diabetes mellitus (review 2) used in computer simulation studies and their models. The systematization of knowledge about these treatment targets and their in silico structures is fundamental, primarily because computer simulation contributes to more accurate planning of future either in vitro or in vivo studies. Therefore, the reviews developed from this protocol will guide decision-making regarding the choice of targets/models in future research focused on therapeutics of obesity or Diabetes Mellitus contributing to mitigate of factors such as costs, time, and necessity of in vitro and/or in vivo assays."
https://openalex.org/W4311501627,"The COVID-19 pandemic posed a major global health challenge. Preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 require the involvement of all sections of society. Knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 preventive measures influence human practices. We describe the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 preventive measure in Bhutan. This was a cross-sectional survey using multistage-cluster sampling involving participants from all 20 districts of the country. The knowledge was assessed using 12 items, attitude using 6 Likert items and practice using 10 items. There was total of 1708 respondents. The mean knowledge was 10.7, (SD = 1.5; range 0-12); 86.38% had good knowledge, 10.95% had average knowledge, 2.69% had poor knowledge. The common sources of knowledge were television (84.9%) and family and friends (74.7%). Those younger than 30 years were associated with good knowledge. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported by 96% and 86.4% agreed that appropriate preventive measures can help control the spread of COVID-19. Nearly all the respondents (97%) wore mask while going out and majority practiced good hand hygiene (87.9%) and proper cough etiquette (84.1%). The knowledge on COVID-19 preventive measures was good and the majority held positive attitudes and practices."
https://openalex.org/W4310844522,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a human inherited heart condition that can cause life-threatening arrhythmia including sudden cardiac death. Mutations in the ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein calmodulin (CaM) are associated with LQTS, but the molecular mechanism by which these mutations lead to irregular heartbeats is not fully understood. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach including protein biophysics, structural biology, confocal imaging, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to determine the effect of the disease-associated CaM mutation E140G on CaM structure and function. We present novel data showing that mutant-regulated CaMKIIδ kinase activity is impaired with a significant reduction in enzyme autophosphorylation rate. We report the first high-resolution crystal structure of a LQTS-associated CaM variant in complex with the CaMKIIδ peptide, which shows significant structural differences, compared to the WT complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the E140G mutation significantly disrupted Cav1.2 Ca2+/CaM-dependent inactivation, while cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) activity remained unaffected. In addition, we show that the LQTS-associated mutation alters CaM's Ca2+-binding characteristics, secondary structure content, and interaction with key partners involved in excitation-contraction coupling (CaMKIIδ, Cav1.2, RyR2). In conclusion, LQTS-associated CaM mutation E140G severely impacts the structure-function relationship of CaM and its regulation of CaMKIIδ and Cav1.2. This provides a crucial insight into the molecular factors contributing to CaM-mediated arrhythmias with a central role for CaMKIIδ."
https://openalex.org/W4311089994,"Biomolecular condensates concentrate proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules and play an essential role in many biological processes. Their formation is tuned by a balance between energetically favorable and unfavorable contacts, with charge-charge interactions playing a central role in some systems. The positively charged intrinsically disordered carboxy-terminal region of the RNA-binding protein CAPRIN1 is one such example, phase separating upon addition of negatively charged ATP or high concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl). Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we measured residue-specific near-surface electrostatic potentials (ϕENS) of CAPRIN1 along its NaCl-induced phase separation trajectory to compare with those obtained using ATP. In both cases, electrostatic shielding decreases ϕENS values, yet surface potentials of CAPRIN1 in the two condensates can be different, depending on the amount of NaCl or ATP added. Our results establish that even small differences in ϕENS can significantly affect the level of protein enrichment and the mechanical properties of the condensed phase, leading, potentially, to the regulation of biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W4311180547,"Human intestinal nematode infections are a global public health issue as they can result in considerable morbidity in infected individuals, mainly in developing countries. These infections continue to go undiagnosed, as they tend to be mainly endemic in resource-poor communities where there is a shortage of experienced laboratory staff and relevant diagnostic technologies. This is further exacerbated by the nature of intermittent shedding of eggs and larvae by these parasites. Diagnostic methods range from simple morphological identification to more specialised high-throughput sequencing technologies. Microscopy-based methods, although simple, are labour-intensive and considerably less sensitive than molecular methods which are rapid and have high levels of accuracy. Molecular methods use nucleic acid amplification (NAA) to amplify the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) fragments of the parasite to detect and determine its presence using different technologies (NAAT). They have increased the sensitivity of detection and quantitation of intestinal nematode infections, especially in low infection intensity settings. The absence of a gold standard test limits current diagnosis and, in turn, restricts intervention measures and effective control efforts. The objective of this review is to determine the accuracy of NAATs in detecting human intestinal nematode infections using Kato-Katz as the reference test for the most common soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and the scotch tape test for enterobiasis and Baermann method for strongyloidiasis. Relevant studies will be identified by searches in electronic databases. Two reviewers will independently screen the literature against eligibility criteria. The methodological quality of studies will then be appraised by two reviewers using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Discrepancies will be addressed by a third reviewer. The true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives of all the studies will be extracted into contingency tables. In paired forest plots, study-specific sensitivity and specificity with a 95 per cent confidence interval will be displayed. The systematic review of this protocol will report the diagnostic accuracy of currently available NAATs for the detection of human intestinal nematode infections. This will help healthcare providers and administrators determine the diagnostic method to be used in different clinical and preventive settings. Trial registration: PROSPERO registration number for this protocol is CRD42022315730."
https://openalex.org/W4311180606,"Animals regularly scan their environment for predators and to monitor conspecifics. However, individuals in a group seem to differ in their vigilance linked to age, sex or state with recent links made to personality. The aims of the study were to investigate whether a) individuals differ consistently in their vigilance, b) vigilance is linked to other personality traits and c) other factors affect vigilance in the colour polymorphic Gouldian finch. Birds were tested in same (red-headed or black-headed) or mixed head colour morph same sex pairs in four contexts (novel environment, familiar environment, two changed environments). Vigilance was measured as horizontal head movements. Vigilance showed contextual consistency but no long-term temporal consistency over a year. Head movements were only weakly linked to other personality traits indicative of a risk-reward trade-off with more explorative individuals being less vigilant. Vigilance was highly plastic across situations and affected by group composition. Mixed head colour morph pairs made more head movements, potentially linked to higher social vigilance. Results indicate that vigilance is a highly plastic trait affected by personality rather than a personality trait on its own, which allows adapting vigilance to different situations."
https://openalex.org/W4311180696,"Various substances, including collagen (Naticol®) and ascorbic acid, that inhibit and prevent skin aging have been studied. Collagen prevents skin aging, has anti-inflammatory effects, and assists in normal wound healing. Ascorbic acid is a representative antioxidant that plays a role in collagen synthesis. To achieve a synergistic effect of collagen and ascorbic acid on all skin types, we prepared a product named ""TEENIALL."" In addition, we used a container to separate ascorbic acid and collagen to prevent the oxidation of ascorbic acid. To confirm the effects of TEENIALL, we first confirmed its penetrability in fibroblasts, keratinocytes, melanocyte, and human skin tissues. Thereafter, we confirmed the collagen synthesis ability in normal human fibroblasts. Based on the results of in vitro tests, we conducted a clinical trial (KCT0006916) on female volunteers, aged 40 to 59 years, with skin wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, to evaluate the effects of the product in improving skin wrinkles, skin lifting, and pigmentation areas before using the product, and after 2 and 4 weeks of using the product. The values of nine wrinkle parameters that were evaluated decreased and those for skin sagging, pigmentation, dermal density, and mechanical imprint (pressure) relief were improved. Skin wrinkle and pigmentation were evaluated to ensure that the improvement effect was maintained even after 1 week of discontinuing the product use. The evaluation confirmed that the effects were sustained compared to those after 4 weeks of using the product. Additionally, skin wrinkles, skin lifting, radiance, and moisture content in the skin improved immediately after using the product once. Based on the results of in vitro and ex vivo experiments and the clinical trial, we show that the product containing ascorbic acid and collagen was effective in alleviating skin aging."
https://openalex.org/W4311180716,"Drug repurposing has been shown to bring safe medications to new patient populations, as recently evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated whether we could use phenotypic screening to repurpose drugs for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease (PD). PD is a fibrotic disease characterised by continued myofibroblast presence and activity leading to formation of a plaque in the penile tunica albuginea (TA) that can cause pain during erection, erectile dysfunction, and penile deformity. PD affects 3–9% of men with treatment options limited to surgery or injection of collagenase which can only be utilised at late stages after the plaque is formed. Currently there are no approved medications that can be offered to patients presenting with early disease before the formation of the plaque. Drug repurposing may therefore be the ideal strategy to identify medical treatments to address this unmet medical need in early PD. We used primary human fibroblasts from PD patients in a phenotypic screening assay that measures TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast transformation which is the main cellular phenotype that drives the pathology in early PD. A library of FDA-approved 1,953 drugs was screened in duplicate wells at a single concentration (10 μM) in presence of TGF-β1. The myofibroblast marker α-SMA was quantified after 72h incubation. A positive control of SB-505124 (TGF-β1 receptor antagonist) was included on each plate. Hits were defined as showing &gt;80% inhibition, whilst retaining &gt;80% cell viability. 26 hits (1.3%) were identified which were divided into the following main groups: anti-cancer drugs, anti-inflammation, neurology, endocrinology, and imaging agents. Five of the top-ten drugs that increase myofibroblast-transformation appear to act on VEGFR. This is the first phenotypic screening of FDA-approved drugs for PD and our results suggest that it is a viable method to predict drugs with potential for repurposing to treat early PD."
https://openalex.org/W4311180745,"Twitter has become an important promotional tool for scholarly work, but individual academic publications have varied degrees of visibility on the platform. We explain this variation through the concept of Twitter-worthiness : factors making certain academic publications more likely to be visible on Twitter. Using publications from communication studies as our analytical case, we conduct statistical analyses of 32187 articles spanning 82 journals. Findings show that publications from G12 countries, covering social media topics and published open access tend to be mentioned more on Twitter. Similar to prior studies, this study demonstrates that Twitter mentions are associated with peer citations. Nevertheless, Twitter also has the potential to reinforce pre-existing disparities between communication research communities, especially between researchers from developed and less-developed regions. Open access, however, does not reinforce such disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4310894519,"In Helicobacter pylori, the nickel-responsive NikR transcription factor plays a key role in regulating intracellular nickel concentrations, which is an essential process for survival of this pathogen in the acidic human stomach. Nickel binding to H. pylori NikR (HpNikR) allosterically activates DNA binding to target promoters encoding genes involved in nickel homeostasis and acid adaptation, to either activate or repress their transcription. We previously showed that HpNikR adopts an equilibrium between an open conformation and DNA-binding competent cis and trans states. Nickel binding slows down conformational exchange between these states and shifts the equilibrium toward the binding-competent states. The protein then becomes stabilized in a cis conformation upon binding the ureA promoter. Here, we investigate how nickel binding creates this response and how it is transmitted to the DNA-binding domains. Through mutagenesis, DNA-binding studies, and computational methods, the allosteric response to nickel was found to be propagated from the nickel-binding sites to the DNA-binding domains via the β-sheets of the metal-binding domain, and a network of residues at the inter-domain interface. Our computational results suggest that nickel binding increases protein rigidity to slow down the conformational exchange. A thymine base in the ureA promoter sequence, known to be critical for high affinity DNA binding by HpNikR, was also found to be important for the allosteric response, while a modified version of this promoter further highlighted the importance of the DNA sequence in modulating the response. Collectively, our results provide insights into regulation of a key protein for H. pylori survival."
https://openalex.org/W4310906984,"Three isoforms of small conductance, calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel subunits have been identified (SK1-3) that exhibit a broad and overlapping tissue distribution. SK channels have been implicated in several disease states including hypertension and atrial fibrillation, but therapeutic targeting of SK channels is hampered by a lack of subtype-selective inhibitors. This is further complicated by studies showing that SK1 and SK2 preferentially form heteromeric channels during co-expression, likely limiting the function of homomeric channels in vivo. Here, we utilized a simplified expression system to investigate functional current produced when human (h) SK2 and hSK3 subunits are co-expressed. When expressed alone, hSK3 subunits were more clearly expressed on the cell surface than hSK2 subunits. hSK3 surface expression was reduced by co-transfection with hSK2. Whole-cell recording showed homomeric hSK3 currents were larger than homomeric hSK2 currents or heteromeric hSK2:hSK3 currents. The smaller amplitude of hSK2:hSK3-mediated current when compared with homomeric hSK3-mediated current suggests hSK2 subunits regulate surface expression of heteromers. Co-expression of hSK2 and hSK3 subunits produced a current that arose from a single population of heteromeric channels as exhibited by an intermediate sensitivity to the inhibitors apamin and UCL1684. Co-expression of the apamin-sensitive hSK2 subunit and a mutant, apamin-insensitive hSK3 subunit [hSK3(H485N)], produced an apamin-sensitive current. Concentration-inhibition relationships were best fit by a monophasic Hill equation, confirming preferential formation of heteromers. These data show that co-expressed hSK2 and hSK3 preferentially form heteromeric channels and suggest that the hSK2 subunit acts as a chaperone, limiting membrane expression of hSK2:hSK3 heteromeric channels.

This organic molecule inhibits SK1- and SK2-mediated current with similar potency (∼750 pM & ∼350 pM respectively), although SK3-mediated current is less sensitive with an IC50 of 2.5 to 9.5 nM (10Hancock J.M.

More recently, novel compounds (NS8593, AP14145 and AP30663) which reduce activation by rightward shifting calcium sensitivity have been developed, and these show little to no subtype selectivity (3Skibsbye L.

Functional SK channels are tetramers, and it has been suggested that they favor assembling as heteromeric channels (27Tuteja D. Rafizadeh S. Timofeyev V. Wang S. Zhang Z.

Preferential assembly of heteromeric small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2015; 41: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The preferential formation of heteromers between SK1 and SK2 subunits has been shown (28Church T.W. Weatherall K.L. Corrêa S.A. Prole D.L. Brown J.T. Marrion N.V. Preferential assembly of heteromeric small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2015; 41: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, co-expression of wildtype (WT) SK2 with an SK1 or SK3 isoform which does not conduct current due to selectivity filter mutations (GYG to AAA) prevents functional channels from forming, suggesting preferential formation of heteromeric channels even with a disrupted inner pore structure (27Tuteja D.

Both human and animal models show that SK subunit expression levels are higher in the atria than the ventricles, and subsequently SK current inhibitors prolong the atrial action potential significantly more than the ventricular action potential (3Skibsbye L.

Physiol. 2021; 12: 342Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Building upon studies which show that heteromeric SK1:SK2 channels preferentially form during co-expression, it has previously been proposed that atrial myocytes display functional heteromeric SK2:SK3 channels (10Hancock J.M. Weatherall K.L. Choisy S.C. James A.F. Hancox J.C. Marrion N.V.

The present study therefore aimed to investigate the ability of human SK2 (hSK2) and human SK3 (hSK3) subunits to form heteromeric channels. We demonstrate that co-expression of hSK2 and hSK3 subunits in HEK293 cells preferentially formed heteromeric channels of a fixed stoichiometry. Co-expression of hSK2 and hSK3 subunits produced a current that displayed intermediate sensitivity to inhibition by apamin or UCL1684 when compared with inhibition of homomeric channel current. The lack of pharmacology indicating homomeric channels demonstrates the preferential formation of heteromeric channels. Expression of functional heteromeric hSK2:hSK3 channels was contingent upon the level of hSK2 subunits. Immunostaining for expressed hSK2 subunits revealed a diffuse pattern of staining which showed a strong degree of correlation between hSK2 and the ER marker DsRed2ER (DsRed) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, cells transfected with hSK3 subunits exhibited a distinctive expression pattern at the cell membrane (Fig. 1B). This difference in localization was confirmed by plotting the signal intensity along a line, across a section of cells. As illustrated in Fig. 1C, hSK3 subunits showed clear peaks at the cell edge. In contrast, expression of hSK2 subunits produced even distribution of subunits within the cell. Immunolabeling of hSK2 subunits in cells co-expressing hSK2 and hSK3 protein showed a similar pattern of expression as observed during expression of hSK2 alone. No distinctive membrane expression was present, and a relatively consistent level of expression was exhibited across the cells (Fig. 2A). As seen when hSK2 subunits were expressed alone, signal intensity plots showed a strong correlation between the ER and hSK2 (Fig. 2Ci). In contrast to the clear membrane labeling observed for hSK3 subunits when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, hSK3 subunits labeling showed that the intracellular distribution during co-expression with hSK2 subunits. Co-expression with hSK2 subunits dictated that hSK3 subunit distribution was similar to that of hSK2 subunits, with labeling showing a reduction in membrane staining and more diffuse distribution (Fig. 2, B and Cii). These data suggested that co-expression with hSK2 subunits reduced hSK3 protein reaching the cell membrane, with a higher proportion residing within the ER. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed to investigate whether differences in intracellular distribution of SK channel subunits affected the magnitude of functional current. Whole-cell hSK2 currents were significantly smaller than those carried by hSK3 (Fig. 2D; 67.4 ± 9.2 pA/pF versus 251.4 ± 27.0 pA/pF; n = 18 & 21; p < 0.0001). Co-expression of the two isoforms resulted in a current which had an amplitude similar to that seen with hSK2 subunit expression alone (59.8 ± 9.4 pA/pF; n = 24; p > 0.05) and was significantly smaller than the current amplitude observed when homomeric hSK3 channels were expressed (p < 0.0001). These observations are consistent with the changes in cellular distribution shown in Figures 1 and 2, suggesting that expression on the cell surface and therefore current density is regulated by expression levels of hSK2 subunits. Expression of homomeric hSK2 or hSK3 subunits produced currents that reversed at -75.9 ± 0.8 mV and -77.9 ± 1.8 mV, respectively (p > 0.05; n = 13 for each), with a current-voltage relationship exhibiting negative slope at positive voltages (Fig. 3, A and B). Application of increasing concentrations of apamin led to hSK2 inhibition with an IC50 of 141 ± 21 pM (n = 7; Fig. 3, A and D). Expressed hSK3—mediated current was significantly less sensitive to apamin and was inhibited with an IC50 of 2.62 ± 0.36 nM (Fig. 3, B and D; n = 7; p < 0.0001). The Hill slope for inhibition by apamin in each channel was similar (1.12 ± 0.09 versus 1.08 ± 0.06, p > 0.05). Co-expression of hSK2 and hSK3 subunits produced an inwardly rectifying current which reversed at -78.6 ± 0.9 mV (n = 14; p > 0.05 versus hSK2 & hSK3; Fig. 3C). Construction of a concentration-inhibition relationships showed current to be inhibited by apamin with an IC50 intermediate to those of the two homomeric channel currents (650 ± 126 pM; n = 7), which was best fit by a monophasic Hill equation (Hill slope 1.18 ± 0.19; p > 0.05 versus homomers; Fig. 3D). Expressed homomeric hSK2-mediated current was more sensitive to inhibition by UCL1684 than current mediated by hSK3 channels (Fig. 4; IC50: 595 ± 79 pM versus 2.72 ± 0.7 nM; n = 6 & 7; p < 0.05; Hill slope 1.1 ± 0.05 versus 1.06 ± 0.11, p > 0.05). Co-expression of hSK2 and hSK3 subunits produced a current with an intermediate sensitivity to UCL1684 (2.37 ± 0.63 nM), the concentration–response relation for which was best fit by a monophasic curve and showed no difference in Hill slope compared with homomeric channels (0.97 ± 0.04; p > 0.05; Fig. 4, C and D). These data indicate that co-expression of hSK2 and hSK3 channel subunits preferentially forms heteromeric channels that display an intermediate sensitivity to inhibitors. Previous experimental work has shown that channel inhibition by apamin occurs when the toxin binds simultaneously to the S3-S4 extracellular loop (SYA/SYT motif in hSK2/hSK3) of one subunit and an outer pore histidine (H336/H485) of an adjacent subunit (21Weatherall K.L.

Heteromeric channel formation was studied by co-expression of WT and outer pore mutant subunits. Expression of hSK3(H485N) subunits produced whole-cell currents of a similar amplitude to that seen when WT-hSK3 subunits were expressed alone (281.7 ± 56.0 pA/pF; n = 16; p > 0.05). These were reduced in amplitude by co-expression with WT-hSK2 subunits, and the amplitude was not significantly different from that observed with expression of WT channels (41.9 ± 11.7 pA/pF; n = 19; p > 0.05; n = 16 Fig. 5). In agreement with previous work (19Lamy C. Goodchild S.J. Weatherall K.L. Jane D.E. Liégeois J.F. Seutin V. et al.Allosteric block of KCa2 channels by apamin.J. Biol.

Co-expression of WT-hSK2 and hSK3(H485N) subunits produced a current which was maximally inhibited by 100 nM UCL1684 to the same degree as observed with WT heteromeric channel current (80 ± 4% versus 88 ± 2%; see Fig. 6B versus Fig. 4D respectively; n = 6 & 8; p > 0.05). Similarly, fractional inhibition by 100 nM apamin was not significantly reduced when hSK3(H485N) subunits were co-expressed with WT-hSK2 subunits compared with when WT-hSK3 subunits were used for co-transfection (82 ± 4% for H485N versus 87 ± 3% for WT; see Figs. 7, B and D and 3D, respectively; n = 7 for both; p > 0.05), demonstrating that no homomeric hSK3(H485N) channels were present during co-expression with hSK2 subunits. This co-expression of WT-hSK2 and hSK3(H485N) subunits produced a channel current which was inhibited by apamin with an IC50 of 588 ± 183 pM (p > 0.05 versus co-expression of WT channels; Fig. 7, B and D). This was best fit by a monophasic relation, indicating a single population of channels and the preferred formation of heteromeric hSK2:hSK3(H485N) channels.Figure 7Apamin sensitivity of cells expressing hSK3(H485N) subunits alone or with WT subunits.

When heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the absence of a functional PAS domain in hERG1b triggers a roughly twofold acceleration in the time course of activation, deactivation, and inactivation recovery in heteromeric hERG1a/1b channels compared with homomeric hERG1a channels (20Sale H.

In human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocyes (hiPSC-CMs), silencing hERG1b by overexpressing a polypeptide that mimics the hERG1a PAS domain slows native IKr gating kinetics and reduces IKr magnitude, triggering increased action potential (AP) duration and early afterdepolarizations (16Jones D.K.

Conversely, disabling the hERG1a PAS domain using PAS-targeting antibodies accelerates IKr gating, increases IKr magnitude, and hastens cardiac repolarization (26Harley C.A. Starek G. Jones D.K.

Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of extracellular protons is enhanced in hERG1b-containing channels (41Wilson S.L. Dempsey C.E. Hancox J.C. Marrion N.V.

Physiol. 2008; 456: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that determine hERG1 subunit abundance and the impact of altered subunit abundance on the susceptibility of arrhythmia are poorly understood. LQTS mutations in the hERG1a PAS domain were shown to disrupt hERG1b trafficking to the membrane (49Harley C.A. Jesus C.S. Carvalho R. Brito R.M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Changes in channel trafficking and protein stability caused by LQT2 mutations in the PAS domain of the HERG channel.PLoS One. 2012; 7e32654Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In murine tissue, targeted mouse ERG1b (mERG1b) deletion not only abolishes IKr in adult mice but also reduces IKr magnitude by roughly 50% in neonates, compared with wildtype littermate controls (50Lees-Miller J.P. Guo J. Somers J.R. Roach D.E. Sheldon R.S. Rancourt D.E. et al.Selective knockout of mouse ERG1 B potassium channel eliminates I(Kr) in adult ventricular myocytes and elicits episodes of abrupt sinus bradycardia.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1856-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mERG1a is selectively downregulated during maturation of the murine heart. In the human heart, hERG1a mRNA transcripts are upregulated and hERG1b transcripts are downregulated in adult ventricular tissue compared with fetal cardiac tissue (3Crotti L. Tester D.J. White W.M. Bartos D.C. Insolia R. Besana A. et al.Long QT syndrome-associated mutations in intrauterine fetal death.JAMA. 2013; 309: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, the relative abundance of hERG1a to hERG1b protein was reduced in failing cardiac tissue compared with nondiseased donor controls (51Holzem K.M. Gomez J.F. Glukhov A.V. Madden E.J. Koppel A.C. Ewald G.A. et al.Reduced response to IKr blockade and altered hERG1a/1b stoichiometry in human heart failure.J. Mol.

In this study, we used in vitro maturation of hiPSC-CMs to probe the impact of hERG1 subunit dynamics on proton modulation of native cardiac IKr. The data presented herein demonstrate that increased hERG1a and reduced hERG1b in matured hiPSC-CMs diminish IKr sensitivity to extracellular protons compared with IKr recorded from immatured hiPSC-CMs. Protons decrease hERG1 current amplitude and accelerate the time course of hERG1 deactivation (27Vereecke J.

However, the specific effects of extracellular acidosis can vary across expression systems. For example, the impact of protons on the voltage dependence of activation is not consistently reported. These variations across systems suggest that other unidentified factors contribute to the response of hERG1 to protons (33Shi Y.P. Cheng Y.M. Van Slyke A.C. Claydon T.W.

Subunit abundance is one factor that may explain the different acidosis sensitivities. To determine the impact of hERG1 subunit abundance on native IKr sensitivity, we cultured hiPSC-CMs on two different matrices to promote distinct stages of maturation and corresponding shifts in hERG1 subunit expression. Culturing hiPSC-CMs on a pliable substrate promotes hiPSC-CM maturation, although the “matured” hiPSC-CMs still retain features of immaturity including irregular shape and absence of t-tubules (54Herron T.J.

We cultured hiPSC-CMs on either a pliable substrate (polydimethylsiloxane [PDMS]) or a stiff substrate (glass). All substrates were coated with Matrigel prior to hiPSC-CM plating. In previous reports using PDMS as a substrate, hiPSC-CMs have more mature electrophysiological features (e.g., increased INa and IK1, faster upstroke velocity and faster conduction velocity, hyperpolarized resting membrane potential [RMP], etc.) compared with hiPSC-CMs plated on a hard substrate (54Herron T.J.

Arrhythm Electrophysiol. 2016; 9e003638Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here, we found that hiPSC-CMs cultured on Matrigel-coated PDMS displayed electrophysiological characteristics consistent with enhanced maturation compared with hiPSC-CMs cultured on Matrigel-coated glass coverslips (Fig. 1). APs recorded from hiPSC-CMs cultured on PDMS displayed hyperpolarized RMPs and larger AP amplitudes compared with APs recorded from hiPSC-CMs cultured on glass (Table 1 and Fig. 1, A–C). In addition, E-4031-sensitive currents, which are indicative of native IKr, showed a trend to be increased in PDMS-cultured hiPSC-CMs compared with glass-cultured hiPSC-CMs. Steady-state IKr density, measured at the end of a 3 s step pulse, was increased from 1.3 ± 0.1 pA/pF in glass-cultured hiPSC-CMs to 1.9 ± 0.3 pA/pF in PDMS-cultured hiPSC-CMs (Table 1 and Fig. 1, D–F). Tail IKr was similarly increased, from 1.4 ± 0.1 pA/pF in glass-cultured hiPSC-CMs to 2.3 ± 0.3 pA/pF in PDMS-cultured hiPSC-CMs (Table 1 and Fig. 1, D, G, and H). hiPSC-CM maturation had no effect on the voltage dependence of IKr activation (Fig. 1I). There was no significant difference in cell capacitance between immatured and matured cells (Fig. 1J).Table 1Biophysical parameters of immatured and matured hiPSC-CMsBiophysical parameterImmatured hiPSC-CMsSDnMatured hiPSC-CMsSDnAPA (mV)84ap = 0.0024.12.0816101.039.5416RMP (mV)−57.29bp < 0.0001.5.7516−71.047.8616Steady-state IKr at −10 mV (pA/pF)1.390.44111.910.849Peak tail IKr at −10 mV (pA/pF)1.48cp < 0.05.0.43102.350.88Steady-state IKr at −10 mV (pA/pF)pH 7.41.47dp ≤ 0.0008.0.4771.91a0.8410pH 6.30.3cp < 0.05.0.2760.930.5210Peak tail IKr at −10 mV (pA/pF)pH 7.40.78cp < 0.05.0.6181.61d0.6110pH 6.30.360.470.650.410Relative steady-state IKr at −10 mV (ISS/ISSMAX)pH 7.40.9ap = 0.0024.0.2270.96a0.110pH 6.30.38cp < 0.05.0.1560.510.2510Rela"
https://openalex.org/W4311114282,"TMEM63B is a mechanosensitive cation channel activated by hypoosmotic stress and mechanic stimulation. We recently reported a brain-specific alternative splicing of exon 4 in TMEM63B. The short variant lacking exon 4, which constitutes the major isoform in the brain, exhibits enhanced responses to hypoosmotic stimulation compared to the long isoform containing exon 4. However, the mechanisms affecting this differential response are unclear. Here, we showed that the short isoform exhibited stronger cell surface expression compared to the long variant. Using mutagenesis screening of the coding sequence of exon 4, we identified an RXR-type endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (RER). We found that this motif was responsible for binding to the COPI retrieval vesicles, such that the longer TMEM63B isoforms were more likely to be retrotranslocated to the ER than the short isoforms. In addition, we demonstrated long TMEM63Bs could form heterodimers with short isoforms and reduce their surface expression. Taken together, our findings revealed an ER retention signal in the alternative splicing domain of TMEM63B that regulates the surface expression of TMEM63B protein and channel function."

Although ample evidence substantiates that the STING signaling pathway plays an essential role in various cancers via cytokines, no comprehensive investigation of secretory proteins regulated by the STING pathway has been conducted hitherto. Herein, we identify 24 secretory proteins significantly regulated by the STING signaling pathway through quantitative proteomics. Mechanistic analyses reveal that STING activation inhibits the translation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) via the STING-PERK-eIF2α signaling axis. PLAU is highly expressed in a variety of cancers and promotes the migration and invasion of cancer cells. Notably, the activation of STING inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion by suppressing PLAU. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the anticancer mechanism of the STING pathway, offering a theoretical basis for precision therapy for this patient population.

STING is an endoplasmic reticulum adaptor that facilitates innate immune signalling.Nature. 2008; 455: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). When pathogens invade cells and release DNA, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytoplasmic dsDNA receptor, can sense this aberrantly present dsDNA and then forms a dimer and undergoes a conformational change in its active region upon binding with DNA and synthesizes the second messenger cGAMP from AMP and GMP (2Li X. Shu C. Yi G. Chaton C.T. Shelton C.L. Diao J. et al.Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is activated by double-stranded DNA-induced oligomerization.Immunity. 2013; 39: 1019-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The binding of cGAMP to STING that locates in the endoplasmic reticulum causes a conformational change in the transmembrane domain of STING, which leads to the formation of the STING tetramer and higher order oligomers through side-by-side packing (3Shang G. Zhang C. Chen Z.J. Bai X. Zhang X. Cryo-EM structures of STING reveal its mechanism of activation by cyclic GMP–AMP.Nature. 2019; 567: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Then, the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment containing STING oligomers transports STING from the endoplasmic reticulum to post-Golgi vesicles where STING recruits the tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and is phosphorylated by TBK1 (4Zhang C. Shang G. Gui X. Zhang X. Bai X. Chen Z.J. Structural basis of STING binding with and phosphorylation by TBK1.Nature. 2019; 567: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 5Gui X. Yang H.

The phosphorylated C-terminal tail of STING recruits the nuclear transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which is phosphorylated by TBK1 and forms dimer to translocate into the nucleus, turns on the transcription of type one interferons, interferon-stimulated genes, and chemokines, triggering immune clearance and immune defense (6Chen W. Li S. Yu H. Liu X. Huang L.

Bell S.L. et al.A conserved PLPLRT/SD motif of STING mediates the recruitment and activation of TBK1.Nature. 2019; 569: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is well established that the STING pathway plays an essential role in tumor development and progression. Spontaneous tumor antigen-specific T-cell priming is dependent on host type I IFN production, via a mechanism that involves the promotion of crosspresentation by CD8α+ DCs (8Diamond M.S. Kinder M. Matsushita H. Mashayekhi M. Dunn G.P. Archambault J.M. et al.Type I interferon is selectively required by dendritic cells for immune rejection of tumors.J. Exp.

Med. 2011; 208: 2005-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Seng-Ryong Woo et al. found that spontaneous CD8+ T-cell priming against tumors is defective in mice lacking STING, but not other innate signaling pathways, suggesting that the major mechanism for innate immune sensing of cancer is via the cGAS-STING pathway (10Woo S.-R. Fuertes M.B. Corrales L. Spranger S. Furdyna M.J. Leung M.Y.K. et al.STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing mediates innate immune recognition of immunogenic tumors.Immunity. 2014; 41: 830-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The STING signaling pathway is necessary for radiotherapy to exert an antitumor effect and serves as a bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses. Studies have shown that the anticancer effects of radiotherapy and targeted therapy depend on the normal expression of STING. Meanwhile, in STING KO mice, CD8+ T cells that should be activated by tumor-associated antigens cannot be activated normally (11Deng L. Liang H. Xu M. Yang X. Burnette B. Arina A. et al.STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing promotes radiation-induced type I interferon-dependent antitumor immunity in immunogenic tumors.Immunity. 2014; 41: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 12Liu X. Pu Y. Cron K. Deng L. Kline J. Frazier W.A. et al.CD47 blockade triggers T cell–mediated destruction of immunogenic tumors.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). When DNA spills out into the cytoplasm due to chromosomal instability in tumor cells or dead tumor cells phagocytosed by macrophages, the intracellular STING signaling pathway will be activated to initiate antitumor immunity (13Corrales L. Gajewski T.F. Endogenous and pharmacologic targeting of the STING pathway in cancer immunotherapy.Cytokine. 2016; 77: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Activation of the STING pathway by intratumoral injection of cGAMP or its analogs results in enhanced antitumor effects of CD8+ T cells, significantly inhibits tumor growth, and prolongs the survival period. Combination of cGAMP with immune system checkpoint inhibitors or radiotherapy results in promising antitumor effects (14Demaria O. De Gassart A. Coso S. Gestermann N. Di Domizio J. Flatz L. et al.STING activation of tumor endothelial cells initiates spontaneous and therapeutic antitumor immunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 15408-15413Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggested that the STING pathway is essential for tumor immune surveillance and antitumor immunity. Besides, Yang H et al. found that intratumoral STING activation delays tumor growth and suppresses lung metastasis in spontaneous cancer models by upregulating type-I IFN genes and vascular stabilizing genes (15Yang H. Lee W.S. Kong S.J. Kim C.G. Kim J.H. Chang S.K. et al.STING activation reprograms tumor vasculatures and synergizes with VEGFR2 blockade.J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129: 4350-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, STING represses the induction and expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells via inhibition of CSF2 and IL-6 expression in Epstein-Barr virus–associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, leading to better patient prognosis (16Zhang C. Ye S. Ni J. Cai T. Liu Y. Huang D. et al.STING signaling remodels the tumor microenvironment by antagonizing myeloid-derived suppressor cell expansion.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 2314-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation of the STING pathway in cancer is associated with increased CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration, and its activation promotes the migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by activating CXCL10 and CCL5 expression (17Parkes E.E. Walker S.M. Taggart L.E. McCabe N. Knight L.A. Wilkinson R. et al.Activation of STING-dependent innate immune signaling by S-Phase-Specific DNA damage in breast cancer.JNCI J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2017; 109: djw199Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Collectively, the STING pathway has been established to play a significant role in anticancer immunity mediated by various cytokines (11Deng L. Liang H. Xu M. Yang X. Burnette B. Arina A. et al.STING-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing promotes radiation-induced type I interferon-dependent antitumor immunity in immunogenic tumors.Immunity. 2014; 41: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 18Khoo L.T.

However, secreted proteins regulated by the STING pathway are incompletely known, which warrants further studies. This study aimed to identify secretory proteins regulated by the STING pathway and explore their effects on cancer. We utilized tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomics to identify the profile of secretory proteins after STING pathway activation. Twenty-four secretory proteins were identified to be significantly regulated by STING; most of these have not been reported in other literature. Furthermore, activation of the STING pathway inhibited the migration and invasion of cancer cells by suppressing PLAU expression. Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying the repressive effect of the STING pathway on tumorigenesis and progression, providing the foothold for the development of future therapeutic approaches. Multiple studies have shown that the STING signaling pathway affects tumor development through secretory proteins such as CXCL10, CCL5, and IFNs (15Yang H. Lee W.S. Kong S.J. Kim C.G. Kim J.H. Chang S.K. et al.STING activation reprograms tumor vasculatures and synergizes with VEGFR2 blockade.J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129: 4350-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Parkes E.E. Walker S.M. Taggart L.E. McCabe N. Knight L.A. Wilkinson R. et al.Activation of STING-dependent innate immune signaling by S-Phase-Specific DNA damage in breast cancer.JNCI J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2017; 109: djw199Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, the recognition of the secreted proteins regulated by the STING signaling pathway is incomplete. Herein, we utilized HFF cells as a normal cell type to study the secreted proteins regulated by the STING signaling pathway. As illustrated in Figure 1A, we utilized cGAMP to activate the STING pathway and then conducted a TMT-labeled quantitative proteomic analysis to identify the secretory proteins regulated by the STING pathway. We confirmed the activation of STING via immunoblotting before performing mass spectral sample processing (Fig. 1B). The proteomic analysis identified a total of 1782 proteins, of which the expression levels of 1651 proteins were quantified. Gene Ontology (GO) cellular component enrichment analysis of the 1651 proteins showed that most of the quantified proteins are located in the extracellular region, vesicle, and extracellular space (Fig. 1C), indicating the quantified proteins are secreted proteins. Unsupervised clustering by principal component analysis showed that the quantified secretory proteins from the cGAMP group and control group were well separated (Fig. S1D). Taken together, these results substantiated the reliability and validity of our experimental method and data. During the comparison of the cGAMP group versus the control group, the quantified 1651 proteins were tested with one-way ANOVA, and the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) screening criteria were set as |log2FC| > 0.585, p < 0.05. A total of 24 DEPs were obtained (Fig. 1D), of which 19 and 5 DEPs were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively, the change tendency of DEPs is displayed in a volcano plot (Fig. 1E). The four upregulated DEPs, including IFNλ1, IFNβ1, CCL5, and CXCL10, have been documented to be encoded by classical STING pathway downstream response genes, which demonstrated the reliability of the results of the proteomics analysis (17Parkes E.E. Walker S.M. Taggart L.E. McCabe N. Knight L.A. Wilkinson R. et al.Activation of STING-dependent innate immune signaling by S-Phase-Specific DNA damage in breast cancer.JNCI J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2017; 109: djw199Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20Hsin F. Hsu Y.-C. Tsai Y.-F. Lin S.-W. Liu H.M. The transmembrane serine protease hepsin suppresses type I interferon induction by cleaving STING.Sci. Signal. 2021; 14: eabb4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Notably, most of the remaining secretory proteins have not been reported to be regulated by the STING pathway. To investigate the biological function of DEPs, we analyzed these 24 DEPs by KEGG and GO pathway enrichment analysis. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the DEPs were significantly enriched in pathways related to the following biological processes: cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, innate immunity signaling pathways, and inflammation-related pathways (Fig. S1A). GO annotation indicated that the DEPs were significantly enriched in biological processes, including the immune response, inflammatory response, and regulation of cell proliferation, and molecular functions including cytokine activity and chemokine activity (Fig. S1B). In addition, we examined the mRNA expression level of genes encoding DEPs after STING pathway activation (Fig. S2). To our surprise, there was no significant difference in mRNA expression of some DEPs after STING signaling pathway activation, suggesting that the STING signaling pathway may regulate certain DEPs expression at the posttranscriptional level. Together, these findings reveal a secretory protein map regulated by STING signaling pathway for the first time and provide a valuable reference for future investigations. Score plots showed that urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) was the most significant putative downstream target of the STING pathway and mainly accounted for the difference between the control and cGAMP groups (Fig. S1C). PLAU, a serine peptidase, which is frequently overexpressed in numerous cancers, participates in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and contributes to cancer cell metastasis (21Carlin S.M. Resink T.J. Tamm M. Roth M. Urokinase signal transduction and its role in cell migration.FASEB J. 2005; 19: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Hildenbrand R. Allgayer H. Marx A.

Quigley J.P. Cell surface remodeling by plasmin: a new function for an old enzyme.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2012; 2012: 564259Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the clinical correlation between PLAU and cancer, we performed expression analyses based on GEPIA2 (gepia2.cancer-pku.cn) and found that PLAU is highly expressed in breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and other malignant cancers (Fig. S1E). Most importantly, PLAU was highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Fig. 2A), a subtype of basal-like breast cancer that does not express ER, PR, and HER2, with high invasiveness and high metastatic potential (24Barzaman K. Karami J. Zarei Z. Hosseinzadeh A. Kazemi M.H. Moradi-Kalbolandi S. et al.Breast cancer: biology, biomarkers, and treatments.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2020; 84106535Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Notably, a 10-year follow-up biomarker-based prospective phase III trial validated the predictive and prognostic effect of PLAU in breast cancer (25Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Meisner C. Friedel C. Untch M. Schmidt M. et al.Ten-year analysis of the prospective multicentre Chemo-N0 trial validates American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)-recommended biomarkers uPA and PAI-1 for therapy decision making in node-negative breast cancer patients.Eur. J. Cancer. 2013; 49: 1825-1835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that reducing PLAU expression in breast cancer is an effective treatment (23Deryugina E.I. Quigley J.P. Cell surface remodeling by plasmin: a new function for an old enzyme.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2012; 2012: 564259Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24Barzaman K. Karami J. Zarei Z.

J. Cancer. 2013; 49: 1825-1835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We detected the expression level of PLAU in different breast cancer cell lines and found that PLAU was highly expressed in TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, while the expression level was very low in MCF7 and other breast cancer cells (Fig. 2B). We stimulated the STING pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells with the STING agonists, cGAMP and diABZI, respectively. The results indicated that both cGAMP and diABZI successfully activated the STING signaling pathway and reduced PLAU protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figs. 2E and S3C). However, PLAU mRNA reduction was minor compared to protein, suggesting the STING signaling pathway may affect the synthesis or degradation of PLAU protein (Fig. S3, A and B). Therefore, we examined whether STING activation affects the degradation/synthesis of PLAU protein. Firstly, we blocked the proteasome degradation pathway and the autophagy pathway, respectively; the results showed that the PLAU protein is degraded by the autophagy pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Meanwhile, the previous study has shown that activation of the STING signaling pathway triggers autophagy (5Gui X. Yang H. Li T. Tan X. Shi P. Li M. et al.Autophagy induction via STING trafficking is a primordial function of the cGAS pathway.Nature. 2019; 567: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We activated STING signaling pathway after treatment with chloroquine and found that STING activation reduced PLAU expression even after blocking autophagy (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that activation of the STING pathway does not inhibit the expression of PLAU by triggering autophagy degradation of PLAU protein in MDA-MB-231 cells. To explore the underlying mechanism of the STING pathway in regulating PLAU expression, we knocked out STING in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S3D). In control cells, the activation of the STING signaling pathway suppressed the expression of PLAU but the reduction of PLAU was abolished in STING KO MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Dan Zhang et al. recently identified a previously unrecognized nonclassical STING signaling pathway that controls mRNA cap-dependent translation (26Zhang D. A non-canonical cGAS–STING–PERK pathway facilitates the translational program critical for senescence and organ fibrosis.NatUre Cell Biol. 2022; 24: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, upon binding with cGAMP, STING directly interacts with PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and activates PERK-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) signal axis, which precedes TBK1-IRF3 activation and independent of unfolded protein response and autophagy. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α at its conserved residue S51, resulting in a reduction of overall protein synthesis (27Zhou D. Palam L.R. Jiang L. Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. Phosphorylation of eIF2 directs ATF5 translational control in response to diverse stress conditions.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7064-7073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the STING-PERK-eIF2α signaling axis mediates the translation regulation of PLAU. We examined the capability of STING to trigger phospho-eIF2α S51 upon binding with cGAMP in MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably, we observed a robust, time-dependent phospho-eIF2α signal, which precedes TBK1-IRF3 activation (Fig. 3C). STING agonist diABZI also triggered the prominent phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2α in a STING-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3D). These results verify a functional STING-PERK-eIF2α signal axis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α at its S51 residue (28Donnelly N. Gorman A.M. Gupta S. Samali A. The eIF2α kinases: their structures and functions.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 3493-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We utilized pharmacological PERK inhibitors GSK2606414 (iPERK-1) and GSK2656157 (iPERK-2) to eliminate STING-initiated phospho-PERK T982 and phospho-eIF2α S51. As illustrated in Figure 3E, the results indicated that cGAMP activates the STING-PERK-eIF2α signaling axis and results in significant repression of PLAU, which was abrogated by PERK inhibitors. These results suggest that the STING-PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway is responsible for STING-dependent PLAU reduction. PLAU performs as a protease and participates in the transition of plasminogen to plasmin, which results in extracellular matrix remodeling, release, and activation of growth factors (29Duffy M. The urokinase plasminogen activator system: role in malignancy.CPD. 2004; 10: 39-49Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 30Danø K. Behrendt N. Høyer-Hansen G. Johnsen M. Lund L.R. Ploug M. et al.Plasminogen activation and cancer.Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 93: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Besides, abysmal patient outcomes in several types of cancers are frequently accompanied by upregulated expression of PLAU (31Ma J. Qi G. Xu J. Ni H. Xu W. Ru G. et al.Overexpression of forkhead box M1 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator in gastric cancer is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis.Oncol. Lett. 2017; 14: 7288-7296PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we further investigated the effects of aberrant expression of PLAU on breast cancer cells by stably overexpressing and knocking out PLAU (Fig. S4, A–D). Overexpression of PLAU in MCF7 and ZR-75-1 cells with low PLAU expression significantly enhanced cell migration ability (Figs. 4A and S3, E and F). Whereas, MCF7 and ZR-75-1 cells cannot invade through the matrigel. Transwell assays indicated that the migration and invasion abilities were significantly increased in PLAU-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells and were blunted in PLAU KO MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4, B–E). Besides, overexpression of PLAU slightly increased the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 cells while KO of PLAU did not affect the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating PLAU does not affect MDA-MB-231 cells proliferation (Fig. S4, G–L). The data indicate that PLAU is responsible for cancer cell migration and invasion. Studies about the STING signal pathway usually focus on the immune microenvironment but the effect of the STING signal pathway on tumor cells is not clear. Here, we investigated the effect of STING pathway activation on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) and EdU assay results indicated that the effect of STING activation on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation is minor (Fig. S5, A–C). As PLAU knockdown shows no effect on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, we concluded that STING does not affect cell proliferation via PLAU repression. Except for proliferative capacity, the rate of clone formation also reflects the population dependence of the cells. STING pathway activation also effectively repressed colony formation, suggesting that STING pathway activation increases the population dependence of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S5D). Whereas, PLAU overexpression did not restore the repression induced by STING pathway activation on colony formation, indicating that STING does not affect population dependence of MDA-MB-231 cells by inhibiting PLAU expression (Fig. S5, E and F). Notably, the transwell assay showed that STING pathway activation inhibits the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5, A and B, E–F). Next, we examined whether the STING pathway affects the migration and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells through repressing PLAU. The results indicated that activation of the STING pathway significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while the repression was reversed under the circumstance where MDA-MB-231 cells overexpress PLAU (Fig. 5, C and D, G–H). The results suggest that the activation of the STING pathway inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion by suppressing PLAU expression, providing a novel insight into the mechanism of cancer suppression mediated by the STING signaling pathway. Overall, this study addresses an as-yet unmet need in understanding STING-regulated secreted proteins, other than cytokines, that might play a role in its antitumor activity. Besides, we substantiated that activation of the STING pathway inhibits the migration and invasion of cancer cells by reducing the expression of the secretory protein PLAU. Since activation of the STING pathway fails to promote IFNβ expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, it can be excluded that the aforementioned effects are due to IFNβ. It has been shown that activating the STING pathway has huge prospects for treating various types of cancers (11Deng L. Liang H. Xu M. Yang X. Burnette B.

For instance, a clinical trial reported that the combination of STING agonist MIW815 (ADU-S100) with spartalizumab could yield anticancer activity against TNBC and melanoma (33Hu Z. Yang Y. Fang L.

PARP inhibitor olaparib inhibits BRCA1-deficient TNBC by activating the secretion of IFNb, CCL5, and CXCL10, as well as the infiltration and activation of CD8 T cells mediated by the STING pathway (34Pantelidou C.

Activation of STING-dependent pathways by c-di-GMP could overcome immune suppression in metastatic breast cancer (35Chandra D. Quispe-Tintaya W. Jahangir A. Asafu-Adjei D. Ramos I.

https://openalex.org/W4311116542,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Ischemia and reperfusion affect multiple elements of cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, especially within the mitochondria. We previously showed that in cardiac monolayers, upon reperfusion after coverslip-induced ischemia, mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨ) unstably oscillates between polarized and depolarized states, and ΔΨ instability corresponds with arrhythmias. Here, through confocal microscopy of compartment-specific molecular probes, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the post-ischemic ΔΨ oscillations, focusing on the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and oxidative stress. During reperfusion, transient ΔΨ depolarizations occurred concurrently with periods of increased mitochondrial oxidative stress (5.07 ± 1.71 oscillations/15 min, N=100). Supplementing the antioxidant system with glutathione monoethyl ester suppressed ΔΨ oscillations (1.84 ± 1.07 oscillations/15 min, N=119, <i>t</i>-test P=0.027) with 37% of mitochondrial clusters showing no ΔΨ oscillations (vs. 4% in control, odds ratio=14.08, Fisher's exact test P < 0.001). We found that limiting the production of reactive oxygen species using cyanide inhibited post-ischemic ΔΨ oscillations (N = 15, <i>t</i>-test P < 10<sup>-5</sup>). Furthermore, ΔΨ oscillations were not associated with any discernable pattern in cell-wide oxidative stress, nor with the changes in cytosolic or mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Sustained ΔΨ depolarization followed cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase and was associated with increased cell-wide oxidative stress. Collectively, these findings suggest that transient bouts of increased mitochondrial oxidative stress underlie post-ischemic ΔΨ oscillations, regardless of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics."

However, women, especially from ethnic and religious minorities, have a low practice of contraceptives in Nepal. This study examined the knowledge and practices of modern contraceptive methods among Muslim women in Nepal.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 Muslim women in the Khajura Rural Municipality of Banke district. Data were collected using face to face structured interviews. Two outcome variables included i) knowledge of and ii) practices of contraceptives. Knowledge and practice scores were estimated using the list of questions. Using median as a cut-off point, scores were categorised into two categories for each outcome variable (e.g., good knowledge and poor knowledge). Independent variables were several sociodemographic factors. The study employed logistic regression analysis, and odds ratios (OR) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at a significance level of p<0.05 (two-tailed).Almost two-thirds (69.2%) of respondents had good knowledge of modern contraceptive methods, but only 47.3% practised these methods. Women of nuclear family (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.38,0.95), and who work in agricultural sector (aOR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.64) were less likely to have good knowledge on modern contraceptives. Women with primary (aOR = 2.59; 95% CI: 1.43, 4.72), secondary and above education (aOR = 4.41; 95% CI:2.02,9.63), women with good knowledge of modern contraceptives (aOR = 2.73; 95% CI: 1.66, 4.51), who ever visited a health facility for FP counselling (aOR = 4.40; 95% CI: 2.58, 7.50) had higher odds of modern contraceptives practices.Muslim women had low use of modern contraceptive methods despite having satisfactory knowledge about them. There is a need for more equitable and focused high-quality FP practices. Targeted interventions are needed to increase the knowledge and practices of contraceptives in the Muslim community. The study highlights the need to target FP interventions among socially disadvantaged women, those living in a nuclear family, and those with poor knowledge of modern contraceptives."
https://openalex.org/W4311180475,"Patients with the genetic blistering skin condition epidermolysis bullosa (EB) report severe pain as a consequence of skin and mucous membrane lesions including blisters, wounds, and scars. Adequate symptom alleviation is not often achieved using conventional pharmacologic interventions. Finding novel approaches to pain care in EB is imperative to improve the quality of life of patients living with EB. There are several anecdotal reports on the use of cannabinoid-based medicines (CBMs) by EB patients to reduce the burden of symptoms. However, controlled clinical investigations assessing these reported effects are lacking. As the pain quality ""unpleasantness"" delineates EB pain, we hypothesize the modulation of affective pain processing in the brain by way of intervention with CBMs comprising the cannabinoids Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol-objectified by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The C4EB study is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover trial. Adult patients with the diagnosis epidermolysis bullosa, reporting chronic pain will be eligible to participate. Following baseline measurements, participants will be randomized to receive the sublingually administered interventions placebo and Transvamix® in forward or reversed orders, each for two weeks and separated by a washout. The primary outcome is the difference in numeric rating scale pain scores between grouped interventions, using affective descriptors within the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2. Secondary outcomes include pain self-efficacy, concomitant analgesic medication-use and adverse events. Additionally, fMRI will be employed to assess brain connectivity related to neuroanatomic pain circuits at baseline, placebo and Transvamix® interventions. The study was approved by the ethical committee at the University Medical Center of Groningen in the Netherlands. Results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Trial registration number: Netherlands Trial Register: NL9347 (Acronym: C4EB)."
https://openalex.org/W4311180481,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health concern. Optimal management of T2D often requires individuals to make substantial changes to their dietary intake. This research employed a qualitative methodology to examine decision making processes underpinning dietary behaviour change. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted on a purposive sample of 21 Australian adults who had recently consulted a dietitian after being diagnosed with T2D. Data were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis and themes were matched deductively with constructs that underpin motivational, volitional, and implicit processes which exist in common models of behaviour change. Influences on motivation, such as a desire to improve health status and making use of valuable support networks featured in participant narratives. Volitional influences included knowing their limits , dealing with falling off the wagon , and learning how their body responds to food . The themes unlearning habits and limit the availability were identified as underpinning implicit influences on dietary change. Individual differences and emotions were constructs additional to the model that influenced dietary change. These findings contribute to a richer understanding of the subjective experiences of adults with T2D regarding dietary change and highlight the multiple processes that guide their decision making in this context."
https://openalex.org/W4311180575,"Background Conventional risk score for predicting in-hospital mortality following Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is not catered for Asian patients and requires different types of scoring algorithms for STEMI and NSTEMI patients. Objective To derive a single algorithm using deep learning and machine learning for the prediction and identification of factors associated with in-hospital mortality in Asian patients with ACS and to compare performance to a conventional risk score. Methods The Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Database (NCVD) registry, is a multi-ethnic, heterogeneous database spanning from 2006–2017. It was used for in-hospital mortality model development with 54 variables considered for patients with STEMI and Non-STEMI (NSTEMI). Mortality prediction was analyzed using feature selection methods with machine learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithm using features selected from machine learning was compared to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score. Results A total of 68528 patients were included in the analysis. Deep learning models constructed using all features and selected features from machine learning resulted in higher performance than machine learning and TIMI risk score (p &lt; 0.0001 for all). The best model in this study is the combination of features selected from the SVM algorithm with a deep learning classifier. The DL (SVM selected var) algorithm demonstrated the highest predictive performance with the least number of predictors (14 predictors) for in-hospital prediction of STEMI patients (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95–0.96). In NSTEMI in-hospital prediction, DL (RF selected var) (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95–0.96, reported slightly higher AUC compared to DL (SVM selected var) (AUC = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.94–0.95). There was no significant difference between DL (SVM selected var) algorithm and DL (RF selected var) algorithm (p = 0.5). When compared to the DL (SVM selected var) model, the TIMI score underestimates patients’ risk of mortality. TIMI risk score correctly identified 13.08% of the high-risk patient’s non-survival vs 24.7% for the DL model and 4.65% vs 19.7% of the high-risk patient’s non-survival for NSTEMI. Age, heart rate, Killip class, cardiac catheterization, oral hypoglycemia use and antiarrhythmic agent were found to be common predictors of in-hospital mortality across all ML feature selection models in this study. The final algorithm was converted into an online tool with a database for continuous data archiving for prospective validation. Conclusions ACS patients were better classified using a combination of machine learning and deep learning in a multi-ethnic Asian population when compared to TIMI scoring. Machine learning enables the identification of distinct factors in individual Asian populations to improve mortality prediction. Continuous testing and validation will allow for better risk stratification in the future, potentially altering management and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4311180581,"The Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LoA) method is almost universally used to compare two measurement methods when the outcome is continuous, despite warnings regarding the often-violated strong underlying statistical assumptions. In settings where only a single measurement per individual has been performed and one of the two measurement methods is exempt (or almost) from any measurement error, the LoA method provides biased results, whereas this is not the case for linear regression.Thus, our goal is to explain why this happens and illustrate the advantage of linear regression in this particular setting. For our illustration, we used two data sets: a sample of simulated data, where the truth is known, and data from a validation study on the accuracy of a smartphone image-based dietary intake assessment tool.Our results show that when one of the two measurement methods is exempt (or almost) from any measurement errors, the LoA method should not be used as it provides biased results. In contrast, linear regression of the differences on the precise method was unbiased.The LoA method should be abandoned in favor of linear regression when one of the two measurement methods is exempt (or almost) from measurement errors."
https://openalex.org/W4311180607,"Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) are prone to overfitting in problems with uncertainty, such as intrusion detection problems. To alleviate this problem, we proposed a method that combines the Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and the ResNet algorithm. This method can make use of the advantages of both the ANFIS and ResNet, and alleviate the overfitting problem of ResNet. Compared with the original ResNet algorithm, the proposed method provides overlapped intervals of continuous attributes and fuzzy rules to ResNet, improving the fuzziness of ResNet. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the proposed method is realized and evaluated on the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset. Also, the performance of the proposed method is compared with the original ResNet algorithm and other deep learning-based and ANFIS-based methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is better than that of the original ResNet and other existing methods on various metrics, reaching a 98.88% detection rate and 1.11% false alarm rate on the KDDTrain+ dataset."
https://openalex.org/W4311180668,"The South African government imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in the world as part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country, including a ban on the sale of tobacco products. This study explored news media coverage of arguments and activities in relation to the South African lockdown tobacco sales ban. We collected media articles published between 26 March to 17 August 2020, which corresponded to the period of the sales ban. Data were sourced via google search and snowball identification of relevant articles. Thematic analysis of data was conducted with the aid of NVivo. We analysed a total of 305 articles relevant to the South African tobacco sales ban during the lockdown. Six major themes were identified in the data: challenges associated with implementing the ban, litigation, and threats of litigation to remove the ban, governance process and politicization of the ban, pro and anti-tobacco sales ban activities and arguments and reactions to the announcement lifting the ban. The initial reason for placing the ban was due to the non-classification of tobacco products as an essential item. Early findings of a link between tobacco smoking and COVID-19 disease severity led to an extension of the ban to protect South Africa’s fragile health system. Pro-sales ban arguments included the importance of protecting the health system from collapse due to rising COVID-19 hospitalization, benefit of cessation, and the need for non-smokers to be protected from exposure to secondhand smoke. Anti-sales ban arguments included the adverse effect of nicotine withdrawal symptoms on smokers, loss of jobs and the expansion of the illicit cigarette markets. Litigation against the ban’s legality was a strategy used by the tobacco industry to mobilize the public against the ban while promoting their business through the distribution of branded masks and door-to-door delivery which goes against current tobacco regulations. The media could serve as a veritable tool to promote public health if engaged in productive ways to communicate and promote public health regulations to the general population. Engagement with the media should be enhanced as part of health promotion strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4311180746,"Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) are widely distributed and can cause serious food-borne diseases for humans such as dysentery. Therefore, an efficient detection platform is needed to detect Shigella and EIEC quickly and sensitively. In this study, a method called recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) was developed for rapid detection of Shigella and EIEC. RPA primers and LFD detection probes were designed for their shared virulence gene ipaH. Primers and probes were screened, and the primer concentration, and reaction time and temperature were optimized. According to the optimization results, the RPA reaction should be performed at 39°C, and when combined with LFD, it takes less than 25 min for detection with the naked eye. The developed RPA-LFD method specifically targets gene ipaH and has no cross-reactivity with other common food-borne pathogens. In addition, the minimum detection limit of RPA-LFD is 1.29×102 copies/μL. The detection of food sample showed that the RPA-LFD method was also verified for the detection of actual samples."
https://openalex.org/W4311180769,"Cortical slow oscillations (SOs) and thalamocortical sleep spindles are two prominent EEG rhythms of slow wave sleep. These EEG rhythms play an essential role in memory consolidation. In humans, sleep spindles are categorized into slow spindles (8-12 Hz) and fast spindles (12-16 Hz), with different properties. Slow spindles that couple with the up-to-down phase of the SO require more experimental and computational investigation to disclose their origin, functional relevance and most importantly their relation with SOs regarding memory consolidation. To examine slow spindles, we propose a biophysical thalamocortical model with two independent thalamic networks (one for slow and the other for fast spindles). Our modeling results show that fast spindles lead to faster cortical cell firing, and subsequently increase the amplitude of the cortical local field potential (LFP) during the SO down-to-up phase. Slow spindles also facilitate cortical cell firing, but the response is slower, thereby increasing the cortical LFP amplitude later, at the SO up-to-down phase of the SO cycle. Neither the SO rhythm nor the duration of the SO down state is affected by slow spindle activity. Furthermore, at a more hyperpolarized membrane potential level of fast thalamic subnetwork cells, the activity of fast spindles decreases, while the slow spindles activity increases. Together, our model results suggest that slow spindles may facilitate the initiation of the following SO cycle, without however affecting expression of the SO Up and Down states."
https://openalex.org/W4311180770,"Percutaneous cervical nucleoplasty (PCN) is a simple, safe, and effective treatment for contained cervical herniated intervertebral disc (CHIVD). However, few studies have compared the actual benefits of PCN against conservative treatment (CT), either clinically or radiographically.The present study sought to analyze and to compare the outcomes of symptomatic contained CHIVD treated with PCN or CT.The present study was designed as a case-control comparative study. Patients who indicated for PCN after a failed CT for more than 6 months were recruited. After the exclusion of some patients who did not meet the selection criteria of the study, we finally enrolled 71 patients treated with PCN. In addition, another 21 patients who indicated for PCN but finally chose to receive CT continuously were also enrolled and categorized as the control group. All patients completed the 6-month follow-up. Pain levels and functional outcomes were evaluated pre- and post-operatively by assessing the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Neck Disability Index (NDI). Radiographic images of 72 of 104 intervened segments were collected to measure disc height and other cervical spinal alignments, such as range of motion, C2-7 Cobb's angle, and C2-7 sagittal vertical axis.Compared with the CT group, the PCN group showed significantly better outcomes on VAS, ODI, and NDI at the 1-month post-operative follow-up, which continued through at least the 6-month follow-up (P < 0.01 for VAS and P < 0.05 for ODI and NDI). The mean disc height significantly decreased, from 6.04 ± 0.85 mm to 5.76 ± 1.02 mm, 3 months after PCN treatment (P = 0.003). However, the degree of disc height decrease did not correlate with the changes of the substantial VAS improvement.To provide therapeutic benefits for symptomatic contained CHIVD patients after an invalid CT for 6 months, PCN seems to be a better option than CT. The reduced disc heights did not alter the clinical outcomes of PCN."
https://openalex.org/W4310894427,"Lactones are prevalent in biological and industrial settings, yet there is a lack of information regarding enzymes used to metabolize these compounds. One compound, γ-valerolactone (GVL), is used as a solvent to dissolve plant cell walls into sugars and aromatic molecules for subsequent microbial conversion to fuels and chemicals. Despite the promise of GVL as a renewable solvent for biomass deconstruction, residual GVL can be toxic to microbial fermentation. Here, we identified a Ca2+-dependent enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (Rpa3624) and showed that it can hydrolyze aliphatic and aromatic lactones and esters, including GVL. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of other related lactonases with experimentally determined substrate preferences shows that Rpa3624 separates by sequence motifs into a subclade with preference for hydrophobic substrates. Additionally, we solved crystal structures of this β-propeller enzyme separately with either phosphate, an inhibitor, or a mixture of GVL and products to define an active site where calcium-bound water and calcium-bound aspartic and glutamic acid residues make close contact with substrate and product. Our kinetic characterization of wild type and mutant enzymes combined with structural insights inform a reaction mechanism that centers around activation of a calcium-bound water molecule promoted by general base catalysis and close contacts with substrate and a potential intermediate. Similarity of Rpa3624 with other β-propeller lactonases suggests this mechanism may be relevant for other members of this emerging class of versatile catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W4310906806,"Deinococcus radiodurans is known for its remarkable ability to withstand harsh stressful conditions. The outermost layer of its cell envelope is a proteinaceous coat, the S-layer, essential for resistance to and interactions with the environment. The S-layer Deinoxanthin-binding complex (SDBC), one of the main units of the characteristic multilayered cell envelope of this bacterium, protects against environmental stressors and allows exchanges with the environment. So far, specific regions of this complex, the collar and the stalk, remained unassigned. Here, these regions are resolved by cryo-EM and locally refined. The resulting 3D map shows that the collar region of this multiprotein complex is a trimer of the protein DR_0644, a Cu-only superoxide dismutase (SOD) identified here to be efficient in quenching reactive oxygen species. The same data also showed that the stalk region consists of a coiled coil that extends into the cell envelope for ∼280 Å, reaching the inner membrane. Finally, the orientation and localization of the complex are defined by in situ cryo-electron crystallography. The structural organization of the SDBC couples fundamental UV antenna properties with the presence of a Cu-only SOD, showing here coexisting photoprotective and chemoprotective functions. These features suggests how the SDBC and similar protein complexes, might have played a primary role as evolutive templates for the origin of photoautotrophic processes by combining primary protective needs with more independent energetic strategies."

Objective Long duration real driving sessions were performed to assess the effect of three seats (soft–S 1 , firm–S 2 and suspended–S 3 ) on perceived discomfort and neuromuscular fatigue (NMF). Materials &amp; methods For each seat, the muscular activity of bilateral Trapezius Descendens (TD), Erector Spinae (ES) and Multifidus (MF) muscles of twenty-one participants was recorded during real driving sessions of 3-hours each lasting approximately 3 hours and following the same itinerary. During each driving session, participants were also regularly asked to self-evaluate their level of whole-body and local discomfort. In addition, an endurance static test (EST) was performed before (ESTpre) and after (ESTpost) each driving session to assess the seat effect on physical capacity. Results Whole-body discomfort increased with driving time for all seats, but this increase became significant latter for S 3 . The highest scores of local discomfort occurred for neck and lower back. Contrary to S 1 and S 2 , the duration of ESTpost was not significantly lower compared to ESTpre with the S 3 . Interestingly, muscular activity of S 1 remained stable throughout the driving task which could be attributed to sustained muscular contraction, while muscular recruitment adjustments occurred for S 2 and S 3 from 1H00 of driving. This muscular compensation concerns mostly the right side for S 2 and S 3 but with different profiles. On the left side, the muscular adjustments concern only the MF with S 2 and the ES with S 3 . Conclusion Overall, our results demonstrated that S 3 could be considered as the most suitable seat to delay discomfort and NMF appearance."

However, it is limited due to the relatively cumbersome methods required to extract nucleic acids from single plant seed allergen (e.g. peanut and soybean). In view of this, an approach of extracting nucleic acid with untreated glass-fiber paper (paper-based microfluidics) was applied for nucleic acid capture and purification from plant seed allergen and commercial products. After cut by hollow cylindrical cutter, a certain size the paper chip it used to absorb DNA. And this paper-based microfluidics with DNA was directly applied for amplification by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).

https://openalex.org/W4311180431,"Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the human optic nerve and tract is technically difficult because of its small size, the inherent strong signal generated by the surrounding fat and the cerebrospinal fluid, and due to eddy current-induced distortions and subject movement artifacts. The effects of the bone canal through which the optic nerve passes, and the proximity of blood vessels, muscles and tendons are generally unknown. Also, the limited technical capabilities of the scanners and the minimization of acquisition times result in poor quality diffusion-weighted images. It is challenging for current tractography methods to accurately track optic pathway fibers that correspond to known anatomy. Despite these technical limitations and low image resolution, here we show how to visualize the optic nerve and tract and quantify nerve atrophy. Our visualization method based on the analysis of the diffusion tensor shows marked differences between a healthy male subject and a male subject with progressive optic nerve neuropathy. These differences coincide with diffusion scalar metrics and are not visible on standard morphological images. A quantification of the degree of optic nerve atrophy in a systematic way is provided and it is tested on 9 subjects from the Human Connectome Project."

In Australia, hospitals are an avenue for influenza vaccine delivery to children with comorbidities but are not always effectively utilised. Qualitative enquiry sought to ascertainment the barriers and enablers for influenza vaccination recommendation, delivery, and recording of these children at Australian hospitals.Semi-structured interviews and discussion group sessions were conducted with paediatricians and nurses at four tertiary paediatric specialist hospitals and two general community hospitals in three Australian states. Transcripts from interviews and group sessions were inductively analysed for themes. The Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model was used to explore the elements of each theme and identify potential interventions to increase influenza vaccination recommendation and delivery behaviours by providers.Fifteen discussion sessions with 28 paediatricians and 26 nurses, and nine in-depth interviews (five paediatricians and four nurses) were conducted. Two central thematic domains were identified: 1. The interaction between hospital staff and parents/patients for influenza vaccine recommendation, and 2. Vaccination delivery and recording in the hospital environment. Six themes across these domains emerged detailing the importance of dedicated immunisation services, hospital leadership, paediatricians' vaccine recommendation role, the impact of comorbidities, vaccination recording, and cocooning vaccinations. Supportive hospital leadership, engaged providers, and dedicated immunisation services were identified as essential for influenza vaccination of children with comorbidities in Australian hospital.Recommendation of influenza vaccination for Australian children with comorbidities is impacted by the beliefs of paediatricians and the perceived impact of influenza disease on children's comorbidities. Dedicated immunisation services and supportive hospital leadership were drivers for influenza vaccine delivery at hospitals. Future interventions targeting hospital-based influenza vaccine delivery for children with comorbidities should take a rounded approach targeting providers' attitudes, the hospital environment and leadership support."

A better understanding of individual treatment outcomes can inform acceptable treatment delivery and promotion. We aimed to explore participant-perceived emotional benefits and transformations throughout DAA treatment among people who inject drugs, who were initiating treatment.Participants were recruited from either a community based clinical trial or community health clinics. Semi structured interviews were conducted with each participant before, during and following treatment. Interviews focussed on treatment perceptions, physical and mental wellbeing and modifiable health behaviours. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Participant and cohort matrices were produced to assess at which time point themes were present and whether themes changed or remained stable over time.This paper presents analysis from 19 participants interviewed between 2017-2019. Most participants were male, with no or mild fibrosis. At baseline, all but one participant had injected drugs in the past month. Three themes relating to the emotional wellbeing and behaviour change described a common treatment experience; 'hopes for better wellbeing', 'lifting the weight' and 'closing the chapter'. Participants were hopeful treatment would improve their emotional wellbeing. Hopes were actualised during treatment as participants began to feel uncertainty and stress easing. Completing treatment improved some participants perceptions of self. Some participants consciously changed their injecting behaviours during treatment.Undertaking and completing treatment was an emotionally and behaviourally transformative period. Participant perceived benefits should be used to inform how treatment benefit is conceptualised and how treatment is promoted in primary care settings."

The Games and their media coverage have a predetermined schedule that enhances the nation's sense of unity by placing a temporary truce on political conflicts. Governments, especially those of Olympic host countries, tend to take advantage of this effect to garner support for their own policies. However, the effects of such media events may be weakening owing to changes in the media environment and increasing political polarization. Examining the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, this case study analyzes a large amount of Twitter data to probe Japanese social media users' attitudes toward the Olympic Games and the relationship of these attitudinal changes with their attitudes toward the political leadership of the prime minister. The results showed that previously negative attitudes toward the Olympic Games improved as people enjoyed the event. However, this positive shift did not appear to be associated with their attitudes toward the prime minister. Users' political predispositions strongly determined their attitudes toward the Olympic Games, indicating that the Olympic Games as a media event had limited implications for support for the administration."

Yet, growing evidence indicates currently the commonness of such deficits among MSA patients in different populations. Our aim was to evaluate the cognitive profile of MSA Tunisian patients and to analyze the underlying clinical and genetic determinants Methods In a retrospective cross-sectional study, clinically-diagnosed MSA patients were included. All subjects underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments to characterize their cognitive profile. The associations with their APOE genotype status were analyzed. Determinant of CI were specified. Results We included 71 MSA patients. Female gender(sex-ratio = 0.65) and MSA-P subtype(73%) were predominant. Mean age of disease onset was 59.1years. CI was found in 85.7% of patients(dementia in 12.7% and Mild cognitive impairment(MCI) in 73% of patients mainly of multiple-domain amnestic type(37.3%)). Mean MMSE score was lower among MSA-P compared to MSA-C(23.52 vs . 26.47;p = 0.027). Higher postural instability gait disorder(PIGD) and MDS-UPDRS-III scores were noted in demented MSA patients(p = 0.019;p = 0.015 respectively). The main altered cognitive domain was attention(64.8%). Executive functions and mood disorders were more affected in MSA-P(p = 0.029,p = 0.035 respectively). Clinical and neurophysiological study of dysautonomia revealed no differences across cognitive subtypes. APOE genotyping was performed in 51 MSA patients with available blood samples. Those carrying APOEε4 had 1.32 fold higher risk to develop CI, with lower MMSE score(p = 0.0001). Attention and language were significantly altered by adjusting the p value to APOEɛ4 carriers(p = 0.046 and p = 0.044 respectively). Executive dysfunction was more pronounced among MSA-P APOEε4 carriers(p = 0.010). Conclusion In this study, the main determinants of CI in Tunisian MSA patients were MSA-P motor-subtype, mainly of PIGD-phenotype, disease duration and APOEε4 carrying status, defining a more altered cognitive phenotype. This effect mainly concerned executive, attention and language functions, all found to be more impaired in APOEε4 carriers with variable degrees across MSA motor-subtypes."

Recently, Brazil suffered major YFV outbreaks with a high fatality rate affecting areas where the virus has not been reported for decades, consisting of urban areas where a large number of unvaccinated people live. We developed a machine learning framework combining three different algorithms (XGBoost, random forest and regularized logistic regression) to analyze YFV genomic sequences. This method was applied to 56 YFV sequences from human infections and 27 from non-human primate (NHPs) infections to investigate the presence of genetic signatures possibly related to disease severity (in human related sequences) and differences in PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values (in NHP related sequences). Our analyses reveal four non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) on sequences from human infections, in proteins NS3 (E614D), NS4a (I69V), NS5 (R727G, V643A) and six non-synonymous SNVs on NHP sequences, in proteins E (L385F), NS1 (A171V), NS3 (I184V) and NS5 (N11S, I374V, E641D). We performed comparative protein structural analysis on these SNVs, describing possible impacts on protein function. Despite the fact that the dataset is limited in size and that this study does not consider virus-host interactions, our work highlights the use of machine learning as a versatile and fast initial approach to genomic data exploration."

A total of 2104 college teachers were surveyed using the Psychological Adaption to Online Teaching Scale between March 25 and March 31, 2020. Data were analyzed using latent profile analysis, chi-square test, and multinomial logistic regression analysis. Based on their psychological adaptation during online teaching immediately after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, college teachers were divided into three latent profiles: common, maladaptive, and positive. Among these, the common type accounted for the largest proportion (56.1%), while the maladaptive type accounted for the smallest (10.9%). There were significant differences in the distribution of psychological adaptation latent types in college teachers with different educational backgrounds and professional titles. A better educational background and higher professional title is closely related with college teachers' psychological adaptation to online teaching."

The purpose of this study was to examine South African pharmaceutical manufacturing workers’ perspectives of health risk factors and absenteeism, and to identify how they perceived a role for the organisation to initiate interventions to improve their health. Materials and methods Five focus groups were conducted to capture 27 employees’ perspectives. The semi-structured focus group discussions were recorded and analysed using a thematic content analysis approach. Results Participants indicated that they were aware of behavioural health risks such as prolonged sitting. They showed insight into strategies to prevent injuries and stay healthy, but also expressed dissatisfaction about the lack of organisational support, leading to stress and consequently absenteeism. Participants emphasized the responsibility of the organisation to support a range of health promoting strategies Conclusions The findings of this study are important for cultivating a tailored workplace intervention to reduce NCD risk factors in the pharmaceutical manufacturing workforce. It is vital that these be supported by leadership of the company through the provision of funding and the development of internal healthcare services."
https://openalex.org/W4311180714,"Background Anthrax continues to be a disease of public health concern in Zimbabwe. Between December 2021 and February 2022, Tengwe reported 36 cases of human anthrax. Gastrointestinal anthrax has the potential to cause serious outbreaks leading to loss of human life. We investigated the outbreak, identified the risk factors using one health approach to inform outbreak control. Materials and methods We conducted descriptive analysis of the outbreak and a 1:2 unmatched case control study to identify risk factors for anthrax. A case was any Tengwe resident who developed an ulcer and/or abdominal symptoms and epidemiologically linked to a confirmed environmental exposure. Validated, structured interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect data from the cases and neighbourhood controls. Soil and dried meat samples were collected for laboratory investigations. District preparedness and response was assessed using a checklist. Data was analysed using Epi Info version 7.2.5. The odds of exposure were calculated for each risk factor examined. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent factors associated with contracting anthrax. Results Through active case finding we identified 36 cases, 31 were interviewed. Twenty-one (67.7%) were males. The median age was 33 years (Inter quartile range: 22–54). Nineteen (61.2%) cases presented with abdominal symptoms with zero deaths reported. The independent risk factor for contracting anthrax was eating under-cooked meat (aOR = 12.2, 95% CI: 1.41–105.74, p = 0.023). All samples collected tested positive for anthrax. No livestock vaccinations or zoonotic meetings were being conducted prior to the outbreak. Notification of the outbreak was done 11 days after index case presentation however one health response was instituted within 24 hours. Conclusion The anthrax was confirmed in Tengwe. Consumption of under-cooked meat was associated with gastrointestinal anthrax. The timely one health response resulted in excellent outcomes. Using one health approach in managing zoonotic threats is encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W4311180715,"Development assistance for health (DAH) is an important source of financing for health for many low-income and some middle-income countries. Most DAH has predominantly been contributed by high-income countries. However, in the context of economic progress and changing global priorities, DAH contributions from countries of the Global South such as India have gained importance. In this paper, we estimate DAH contributed by India between 2009 and 2020.We leveraged data from budgetary documents, databases, and financial reports of the Ministry of External Affairs and multilateral organizations to estimate DAH contributions. The proportions of development assistance that go towards health in major recipient countries were estimated and reported by recipient country and year.Between 2009 and 2020, DAH contributed by India to bilateral and multilateral partners totaled $206.0 million. South Asian countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar received the most DAH from India. DAH contributed relative to DAH received ranged from 1.42% in 2009 to 5.26% in 2018, the latest year with country-level data. Health focus areas prioritized by India included technical training and innovation, health care infrastructure support, and supply of medications and medical equipment.India is an important development partner to many countries-particularly to those in the South Asian region. India's DAH allocation strategy prioritizes contributions toward neighboring countries in the South Asia region in several health focus areas. Detailed project-level data are needed to estimate DAH contributions from India with greater precision and accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4311180748,"Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease with an early onset, but little is known about its psychological effects in middle childhood. The present study was the first to explore the relationship between mental health, wellbeing, and lifestyle of 8-11 years old children with Type 1 diabetes and their parents, and a healthy comparison group. A total of 200 parent-child dyads were recruited in diabetic clinics and from primary schools in Kuwait. Both groups completed a series of behavioural and physical assessments relating to health, wellbeing, and lifestyle. A significant relationship was found between higher Body Mass Index (BMI) and poorer mental health, including low academic self-esteem, depression, and anxiety, in the diabetes group. This group had significantly higher mean scores in mental health problems, and lower scores in wellbeing, compared with control group. Both groups had poor dietary habits and low levels of physical activity. Unlike previous studies, no differences were found between parents' mental health for children with Type 1 diabetes and parents of the control group. Although elevated problem scores on a variety of indices remained within normal range, the pattern of results indicates that children with diabetes would profit from early screening and preventative intervention to reduce the likelihood of psychological and behavioural difficulties later on."
https://openalex.org/W4311180771,"Background Rape is the most common act of violence against women during wartime which is considered interpersonal, social and political violence because survivors usually suffer from stigma and discrimination in the community. Sexual violence is a serious threat to women’s health. The psychological and medical consequences of rape during the conflict period are not well documented. Therefore, this study investigated the psychological and medical consequences of rape among survivor in the northern Ethiopia conflict, which occurred since 2020–2022. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional survey supplemented with a qualitative data was conducted among survivors of rape recorded until June 2022. Health institutions that provide maternal and child health services in the study area were included. All rape victims who received medical care following the incident were included. Victims who were found in active war areas or rape care recorded before wartime were excluded. To understand the experience of raped women’s psychological consequences related to sexual assault we conducted 23 in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was used to conduct qualitative interpretation. Results The mean age of the participants was 31.66 (SD ± 20.95) years. One-third of 92(33.9%) of the survivors were diagnosed positive for sexually transmitted infections. Chlamydia 54(58.4%) and HIV 32(34.8%) were the most frequently diagnosed infections. Among the rape survivors, one-tenth 29(10.7%) of them were positive for pregnancy, and induced abortion was done for 13 (44.8%) women who got pregnant due to sexual assault. The armed groups not only have sexual interests but inhumane individuals and consider rape as their way of expressing abjection to civilians. Survivors of raped women are confronted with social rejection and exclusion in the community that aggravates the traumatic process. Because of shame and fear, rape survivors often do not seek help but have to be offered support proactively. The victims claimed that they didn’t able to return to their previous life and considered their future in peril. Conclusion Conflict has a multidimensional devastating life effect, especially on women’s health. The victims experienced many physical and psychological consequences. Hence, resolving conflicts with peaceful discussion has numerous benefits for civilians."
https://openalex.org/W4311180780,"Numerous studies have documented a strong intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. In explaining this transmission, separate fields of research have studied separate mechanisms. To obtain a more complete understanding, the current study integrates insights from the fields of behavioural sciences and genetics and examines the extent to which paternal involvement and children's polygenic score (PGS) are unique underlying mechanisms, correlate with each other, and/or act as important confounders in the intergenerational transmission of fathers' educational attainment. To answer our research questions, we use rich data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 4,579). Firstly, results from our mediation analyses showed a significant association between fathers' educational attainment and children's educational attainment (0.303). This association is for about 4 per cent accounted for by paternal involvement, whereas a much larger share, 21 per cent, is accounted for by children's education PGS. Secondly, our results showed that these genetic and behavioural factors are significantly correlated with each other (correlations between 0.06 and 0.09). Thirdly, we found support for genetic confounding, as adding children's education PGS to the model reduced the association between paternal involvement and children's educational attainment by 11 per cent. Fourthly, evidence for social confounding was almost negligible (the association between child's education PGS and educational attainment was only reduced by half of a per cent). Our findings highlight the importance of integrating insights and data from multiple disciplines in understanding the mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of inequality, as our study reveals that behavioural and genetic influences overlap, correlate, and confound each other as mechanisms underlying this transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4311180873,"Microtubule-associated 1B (MAP1B) proteins are expressed at the nervous system level where they control cytoskeleton activity and regulate neurotransmitter release. Here, we report about the identification of a planarian MAP1B factor (DjMap1B) that is enriched in cephalic ganglia and longitudinal nerve cords but not in neoblasts, the plentiful population of adult stem cells present in planarians, thanks to which these animals can continuously cell turnover and regenerate any lost body parts. DjMap1B knockdown induces morphological anomalies in the nervous system and affects neoblast commitment. Our data put forward a correlation between a MAP1B factor and stem cells and suggest a function of the nervous system in non-cell autonomous control of planarian stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W4311217868,"In this article, a new robust ratio type estimator using the Uk's redescending M-estimator is proposed for the estimation of the finite population mean in the simple random sampling (SRS) when there are outliers in the dataset. The mean square error (MSE) equation of the proposed estimator is obtained using the first order of approximation and it has been compared with the traditional ratio-type estimators in the literature, robust regression estimators, and other existing redescending M-estimators. A real-life data and simulation study are used to justify the efficiency of the proposed estimators. It has been shown that the proposed estimator is more efficient than other estimators in the literature on both simulation and real data studies."
https://openalex.org/W4311222759,"The effect of spatial nonuniformity of the temperature distribution was examined on the capability of machine-learning algorithms to provide accurate temperature prediction based on Laser Absorption Spectroscopy. First, sixteen machine learning models were trained as surrogate models of conventional physical methods to measure temperature from uniform temperature distributions (uniform-profile spectra). The best three of them, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), VGG13, and Boosted Random Forest (BRF) were shown to work excellently on uniform profiles but their performance degraded tremendously on nonuniform-profile spectra. This indicated that directly using uniform-profile-targeted methods to nonuniform profiles was improper. However, after retraining models on nonuniform-profile data, the models of GPR and VGG13, which utilized all features of the spectra, not only showed good accuracy and sensitivity to spectral twins, but also showed excellent generalization performance on spectra of increased nonuniformity, which demonstrated that the negative effects of nonuniformity on temperature measurement could be overcome. In contrast, BRF, which utilized partial features, did not have good generalization performance, which implied the nonuniformity level had impact on regional features of spectra. By reducing the data dimensionality through T-SNE and LDA, the visualizations of the data in two-dimensional feature spaces demonstrated that two datasets of substantially different levels of non-uniformity shared very closely similar distributions in terms of both spectral appearance and spectrum-temperature mapping. Notably, datasets from uniform and nonuniform temperature distributions clustered in two different areas of the 2D spaces of the t-SNE and LDA features with very few samples overlapping."
https://openalex.org/W4311502546,"To adopt the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to enhance data sharing, the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative (CureSCi) MetaData Catalog (MDC) was developed to make Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) study datasets more Findable by curating study metadata and making them available through an open-access web portal.Study metadata, including study protocol, data collection forms, and data dictionaries, describe information about study patient-level data. We curated key metadata of 16 SCD studies in a three-tiered conceptual framework of category, subcategory, and data element using ontologies and controlled vocabularies to organize the study variables. We developed the CureSCi MDC by indexing study metadata to enable effective browse and search capabilities at three levels: study, Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Measures, and data element levels.The CureSCi MDC offers several browse and search tools to discover studies by study level, PRO Measures, and data elements. The ""Browse Studies,"" ""Browse Studies by PRO Measures,"" and ""Browse Studies by Data Elements"" tools allow users to identify studies through pre-defined conceptual categories. ""Search by Keyword"" and ""Search Data Element by Concept Category"" can be used separately or in combination to provide more granularity to refine the search results. This resource helps investigators find information about specific data elements across studies using public browsing/search tools, before going through data request procedures to access controlled datasets. The MDC makes SCD studies more Findable through browsing/searching study information, PRO Measures, and data elements, aiding in the reuse of existing SCD data."
