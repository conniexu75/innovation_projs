https://openalex.org/W1987566410,"A group of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, such as 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and wortmannin, have been widely used as autophagy inhibitors based on their inhibitory effect on class III PI3K activity, which is known to be essential for induction of autophagy. In this study, we systematically examined and compared the effects of these two inhibitors on autophagy under both nutrient-rich and deprivation conditions. To our surprise, 3-MA is found to promote autophagy flux when treated under nutrient-rich conditions with a prolonged period of treatment, whereas it is still capable of suppressing starvation-induced autophagy. We first observed that there are marked increases of the autophagic markers in cells treated with 3-MA in full medium for a prolonged period of time (up to 9 h). Second, we provide convincing evidence that the increase of autophagic markers is the result of enhanced autophagic flux, not due to suppression of maturation of autophagosomes or lysosomal function. More importantly, we found that the autophagy promotion activity of 3-MA is due to its differential temporal effects on class I and class III PI3K; 3-MA blocks class I PI3K persistently, whereas its suppressive effect on class III PI3K is transient. Because 3-MA has been widely used as an autophagy inhibitor in the literature, understanding the dual role of 3-MA in autophagy thus suggests that caution should be exercised in the application of 3-MA in autophagy study.

Autophagy refers to an evolutionarily conserved process in which intracellular proteins and organelles are sequestered in autophagosomes and subsequently degraded by lysosomal enzymes for the purpose of recycling cellular components to sustain metabolism during nutrient deprivation and to prevent accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles (1.Mizushima N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2861-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 2.Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a dynamic process, consisting of several sequential stages (initiation, nucleation, elongation, and maturation) controlled by a group of autophagy-related genes (Atg genes). So far, more than 30 Atg genes have been identified in yeast, and many of them have homologues in mammalian cells (3.Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar).

Espert L. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Codogno P. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase serving as the convergence point for many of the upstream stimuli and pathways to regulate cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis, translation, and autophagy (5.Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 206-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6.Reiling J.H. Sabatini D.M.

Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Abundance of nutrients, including growth factors, glucose, and amino acids will activate mTOR and suppress autophagy, whereas nutrient deprivation will suppress mTOR, leading to activation of autophagy. At present, the molecular mechanisms downstream of mTOR responsible for its anti-autophagic function have not been fully understood. In yeast, TOR directly targets the ATG13-ATG1 complex and suppresses its function at the initiation stage of autophagy (8.Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the complex containing ULK1 (the ATG1 homologue), ATG13, and FIP200 is directly controlled by mTOR and is a critical part of the autophagy machinery in response to nutritional status (9.Hara T.

Among many signaling pathways controlling mTOR activation, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is the key element in response to growth factors, such as insulin (11.Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4640) Google Scholar). PI3K is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) at the 3′-position of the inositol ring. In mammalian cells, there are three classes of PI3K: the class I PI3K mainly phosphorylates PI 4,5-bisphosphate to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), whereas the class III PI3K/hVps34 only phosphorylates PI to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). Little is currently known about the class II PI3K, which appears to catalyze PI3P and PI 3,4-bisphosphate from PI (12.Backer J.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 13.Engelman J.A. Luo J. Cantley L.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar). The class I PI3K is a heterodimer consisting of a p85 regulatory and a p110 catalytic subunit and is mainly activated via the insulin receptor, leading to activation of AKT by two kinases: PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2). The fully activated AKT then acts on the tuberous sclerosis complex (consisting of TSC1-TSC2) and Rheb, leading to activation of mTOR complex 1 and subsequently suppression of autophagy (6.Reiling J.H. Sabatini D.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6373-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14.Corradetti M.N. Guan K.L. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6347-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In contrast, the class III PI3K/hVps34 is known to be a positive regulator of autophagy, in addition to its function in vesicular trafficking in the endosomal/lysosomal system (12.Backer J.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 15.Chang Y.Y. Juhász G. Goraksha-Hicks P. Arsham A.M. Mallin D.R. Muller L.K. Neufeld T.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that hVps34 mediates autophagy at both the initiation and maturation stage of autophagosomes by forming different protein complexes with various partners, including ATG6/Beclin 1, ATG14L, UVRAG, and Rubicon (16.Itakura E.

A group of PI3K inhibitors, including 3-methyladenine (3-MA), wortmannin, and LY294002, have been well established as autophagy inhibitors (21.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Although all of these tested PI3K inhibitors target both class I and class III PI3K indiscriminately (24.Kong D. Yamori T. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 1734-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25.Knight Z.A. Shokat K.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), they have been proposed to suppress autophagy by inhibiting the class III PI3K to block the production of PI3P (26.Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), which is essential for the initiation of autophagy via recruitment of other ATG proteins at the isolation membrane or phagophore (4.Pattingre S. Espert L. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Codogno P. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 27.Zeng X. Overmeyer J.H. Maltese W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Notably, most of the earlier studies proving the anti-autophagic function of these inhibitors were conducted in conditions where cells were isolated from starved animals or cultured in nutrient-deprived medium with relatively short periods of time (23.Blommaart E.F. Krause U. Schellens J.P. Vreeling-Sindelárová H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 26.Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J.

U.S.A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). The effects of these inhibitors on autophagy induced by other stimuli in a nutrient-rich environment have not been evaluated systematically. Here we investigated the effect of two commonly used PI3K inhibitors 3-MA and wortmannin on autophagy under both nutrient-rich and deprivation conditions. To our surprise, 3-MA is found to promote autophagy when treated in full medium for a prolonged period, whereas it is still capable of inhibiting starvation-induced autophagy. In contrast, wortmannin is able to suppress autophagy regardless of the nutrient status. The autophagy promotion activity of 3-MA is due to its differential temporal effects on class I and class III PI3K; 3-MA blocks class I PI3K persistently, whereas its suppressive effect on class III PI3K is transient. Because PI3K inhibitors, such as 3-MA, are widely used as autophagy inhibitors in the literature, understanding the dual role of 3-MA in autophagy thus suggests that great caution should be exercised in the application of 3-MA in autophagy study and in the data interpretation using this inhibitor. Our data also indicate that wortmannin is a more suitable autophagy inhibitor due to its more persistent inhibition on class III PI3K. Anti-LC3, anti-ULK1, anti- FLAG, and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-p62 and anti-ATG5-ATG12 antibodies were from Abnova and Nanotools, respectively. Anti-ATG7 antibody was from Prosci, and anti-GFP antibody was from Covance. All other antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. 3-MA, wortmannin, doxycyclin, chloroquine diphosphate (CQ), rapamycin, cycloheximide (CHX), actinomycin D, and Earles' balanced salt solution (EBSS) were purchased from Sigma. Cathepsin B substrate (Z-Arg-Arg-AMC), cathepsin L substrate (Ac-His-Arg-Tyr-Arg-ACC), E-64d, and pepstatin A were purchased from Calbiochem. Lysosensor green DND-189 was from Invitrogen. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), L929 cells, HEK293T cells, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) (defined as full medium in this study) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The Atg5−/− MEFs and the Tet-off Atg5 MEFs were provided by Dr. N. Misushima (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). The Tsc2−/− MEFs were a generous gift from Dr. D. J. Kwiatkowski. The HA-ULK1 plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. N. Mizushima (Tokyo Medical and Dental University), which has been described elsewhere (9.Hara T. Takamura A. Kishi C. Iemura S. Natsume T. Guan J.L. Mizushima N. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 29.Hosokawa N. Hara T. Kaizuka T. Kishi C. Takamura A. Miura Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Takehana K. Yamada N. Guan J.L. Oshiro N. Mizushima N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). The mRFP-GFP tandem fluorescence-tagged LC3 construct (tfLC3) was provided by Dr. T. Yoshimori (Osaka University) (30.Kimura S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was performed using the Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The tfLC3 stably transfected L929 cells have been described previously (31.Wu Y.T. Tan H.L. Huang Q. Ong C.N. Shen H.M. Autophagy. 2009; 5: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis was performed following standard procedures. The cells were lysed in M2 lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce), and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). An equal amount of protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After it was blocked with 5% nonfat milk, the membrane was probed with the designated first and second antibodies and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce) and visualized by a Kodak Image Station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Co.). The co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed following the established protocol with minor modifications (29.Hosokawa N. Hara T. Kaizuka T. Kishi C. Takamura A. Miura Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Takehana K. Yamada N. Guan J.L. Oshiro N. Mizushima N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells after treatment were lysed for 1 h in the co-immunoprecipitation lysis buffer: 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.3% CHAPS, phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce), and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate containing the same amount of protein was precleared by 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h. The postcleared lysate was then incubated with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads and 1 μg of antibody and mixed overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer five times, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in sample buffer (Bio-Rad) for Western blotting. Cells were seeded to a coverglass slide chamber (Lab-Tek®, NUNC), and after the designated treatments, the cells were examined under a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 2000). The GFP-LC3 puncta were quantified by counting the number in cells as described elsewhere (32.Vergne I. Roberts E. Elmaoued R.A. Tosch V. Delgado M.A. Proikas-Cezanne T. Laporte J. Deretic V. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2244-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GFP-LC3 puncta in a single cell were manually counted under a confocal microscope. For each group, 50 cells were randomly selected for the average number of GFP-LC3 puncta/cell. The data presented were from one representative experiment of at least three independent repeats. The nonspecific siRNA oligonucleotides and siRNA oligonucleotides targeting mouse Atg7 (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpoolTM) were obtained from Dharmacon (Layfayette, CO). The siRNAs was transfected into the L929 cells with stable expression of tfLC3 using the DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Determination of cathepsin B/L activity in total cell extracts was conducted as described previously with modifications (33.Wu Y.T. Tan H.L. Huang Q. Kim Y.S. Pan N. Ong W.Y. Liu Z.G. Ong C.N. Shen H.M. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in M2 buffer, and the lysate (25 μg of cellular protein) was then incubated with a 50 μm concentration of the fluorogenic cathepsin B/L substrates, respectively, in 100 μl of cell-free system buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a 96-well plate for 1 h at 37 °C. The released AMC/ACC fluorophores were monitored by a fluorometer (Tecan SpectraFluor Plus) at an excitation wavelength of 409/380 nm and an emission wavelength of 505/460 nm. Data are presented as percentage of fluorescence intensity compared with the control group. The measurement of intralysosomal pH was performed based on an established method with modifications (34.Bains M. Heidenreich K.A. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 453: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, after designated treatments, cells were incubated with 1 μm Lysosensor probe (Invitrogen) for 1 h and then were trypsinized and collected and resuspended in phenol red-free medium. Ten thousand cells from each sample were analyzed using FACSCalibur flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was used as a template for cDNA synthesis with a QuantiTect reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen). An equal volume of cDNA product was used in the PCR performed using the TopTaq Master Mix Kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification was performed using the following primers (purchased from Sigma): mouse p62 gene 5′-AGCTGCCCTCAGCCCTCTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCTTCTCTTCCCTCCATGTT-3′ (reverse) and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 5′-GTGTTCCTACCCCCAATGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTCATCATACTTGGCAGGTTTC-3′ (reverse). The PCR conditions were set according to the standard protocol. The PCR products were resolved on agarose gel containing GelRedTM nucleic acid gel stain (Biotium) and exposed using a Kodak Image Station 440CF. Cells were seeded on 75-cm2 flasks and grown to 60% confluence and then treated as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5. The extraction and quantification of the PI3P/PI(3,4,5)P3 were determined by the PI3P/PI(3,4,5)P3 mass strip kits, respectively (Echelon Biosciences), following the instructions from the manufacturer. In addition, we also adopted another method for the quantification of PI(3,4,5)P3, following a method described previously (35.Nasuhoglu C. Feng S. Mao J. Yamamoto M. Yin H.L. Earnest S. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Hilgemann D.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected in 0.8 ml of ice-cold methanol, 12 n HCl (96:4), supplemented with 2 mm AlCl3. Lipids were then extracted by adding 0.4 ml of ice-cold chloroform and 0.4 ml of ice-cold water. The lower organic phase was collected, and remaining solution was re-extracted twice with 0.4 ml of ice-cold chloroform. The three lipid extracts were then combined and washed with 1 ml of ice-cold methanol, 2 mm oxalic acid in water (1:0.9). Lower organic phase was collected and dried using Speedvalc (Thermo Savant, Milford, MA) and deacylated by incubation with 0.5 ml of methylamine/water:n-butanol/MetOH (36:8:9:47) at 50 °C for 1 h. The aqueous phase was dried, resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1-butanol/petroleum ether/ethyl formate (20:40:1), and extracted twice with an equal volume of water. Aqueous extracts were dried, resuspended in water, and subjected to anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography analysis using a Dionex Ion Chromatography 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein degradation was measured as described previously (36.Bauvy C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were radiolabeled for 24 h with 0.05 mCi/ml l-[U-14C]valine. At the end of the labeling period, cells were rinsed three times with PBS. Cells were incubated for the designated times in either full medium or EBSS with or without the presence of 10 mm 3-MA. All data presented are representatives from at least three independent experiments. The numeric data from the protein degradation assay, cathepsin activity analysis, GFP-LC3 puncta counting, and quantification of PI(3,4,5)P3 using chromatography are presented as means ± S.D. from three independent experiments and analyzed using student t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. PI3K inhibitors, such as 3-MA and wortmannin, have been widely used to inhibit autophagy (23.Blommaart E.F. Krause U. Schellens J.P. Vreeling-Sindelárová H. Meijer A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 26.Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Because most of the initial studies establishing the anti-autophagic function of these inhibitors were conducted under starvation condition, our initial intention was to examine the effects of these inhibitors on autophagy induced by other stimuli under nutrient-rich conditions (in full culture medium). To our surprise, it was found that prolonged treatment with 3-MA (up to 9 h) induced significant LC3 I to II conversion in wild type MEFs (Fig. 1A, left), whereas it was still effective in suppressing LC3 II conversation in the same cell type induced by starvation (by culturing in EBSS) (Fig. 1A, right). Moreover, similar results were also observed in L929 mouse fibrosarcoma cells (Fig. 1B) and human renal epithelial 293T cells (data not shown). These results thus suggest that the proautophagy effects of 3-MA are unlikely to be cell type-specific. The effectiveness of 3-MA as a PI3K inhibitor was confirmed by the suppression of S6 protein phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B, left), a surrogate marker for mTOR activity (37.Dann S.G. Selvaraj A. Thomas G. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 252-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In contrast, no similar results were observed in cells treated with wortmannin, another commonly used PI3K and autophagy inhibitor (26.Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), in WT MEFs (Fig. 1C) and in L929 and 293T cells (data not shown). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on S6 phosphorylation was found to be rather transient because the S6 protein phosphorylation level returned to normal after 6 h in cells cultured in full medium (Fig. 1C, left). In order to confirm the above results of LC3 detected by Western blot, we next tested the changes of the GFP-LC3 distribution pattern in MEFs with stable expression of the GFP-LC3 (38.Hosokawa N. Hara Y. Mizushima N. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2623-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 39.Mizushima N. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, prolonged treatment with 3-MA, but not wortmannin, in full medium, markedly increased GFP-LC3 punctuation/aggregation. In contrast, both 3-MA and wortmannin were able to block starvation-induced GFP-LC3 punctuation/aggregation in cells cultured in EBSS (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that prolonged treatment with 3-MA, but not wortmannin, under nutrient-rich conditions is capable of increasing LC3 II conversation and punctuate formation of GFP-LC3, indicating the possibility of enhanced autophagic flux.

https://openalex.org/W2095032938,"Although the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) has been known for decades, its precise mechanism of action remains incompletely understood. The glutarimide portion of CHX is seen in a family of structurally related natural products including migrastatin, isomigrastatin and lactimidomycin (LTM). We found that LTM, isomigrastatin and analogs have a potent antiproliferative effect on tumor cell lines and selectively inhibit translation. A systematic comparative study of the effects of CHX and LTM on protein synthesis revealed both similarities and differences between the two inhibitors. Both LTM and CHX were found to block the translocation step in elongation. Footprinting experiments revealed protection of a single cytidine nucleotide (C3993) in the E-site of the 60S ribosomal subunit, thus defining a common binding pocket for the two inhibitors in the ribosome. These results shed new light on the molecular mechanism of inhibition of translation elongation by both CHX and LTM."
https://openalex.org/W2025344323,"Integrase is an essential retroviral enzyme that binds both termini of linear viral DNA and inserts them into a host cell chromosome. The structure of full-length retroviral integrase, either separately or in complex with DNA, has been lacking. Furthermore, although clinically useful inhibitors of HIV integrase have been developed, their mechanism of action remains speculative. Here we present a crystal structure of full-length integrase from the prototype foamy virus in complex with its cognate DNA. The structure shows the organization of the retroviral intasome comprising an integrase tetramer tightly associated with a pair of viral DNA ends. All three canonical integrase structural domains are involved in extensive protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions. The binding of strand-transfer inhibitors displaces the reactive viral DNA end from the active site, disarming the viral nucleoprotein complex. Our findings define the structural basis of retroviral DNA integration, and will allow modelling of the HIV-1 intasome to aid in the development of antiretroviral drugs. The integrase protein of retroviruses such as HIV-1 catalyses insertion of the viral genome into the host's, where the virus is able to persist in a cell indefinitely. As integration is critical for viral replication, integrase has been a target for drug development, and several inhibitors — including raltegravir and elvitegravir — are used therapeutically or are undergoing clinical trial. The search for new antiretroviral drugs has been hampered by the lack of a structure of the integrase complex (or intasome) on substrate DNA. Now the crystal structure of full-length retroviral integrase from the non-pathogenic retrovirus known as prototype foamy virus has been determined, in complex with its cognate viral DNA. As well as revealing details of the biochemistry of the integration reaction, the structure shows how current inhibitors affect this process. The integrase protein of retroviruses such as HIV-1 catalyses insertion of the viral genome into that of the host. Here, the long-awaited structure of the full-length integrase complex is predicted, revealing not only details of the biochemistry of the integration reaction, but also the means by which current inhibitors affect this process."
https://openalex.org/W2082793267,"Tissue-specific transcriptional regulation is central to human disease. To identify regulatory DNA active in human pancreatic islets, we profiled chromatin by formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements coupled with high-throughput sequencing (FAIRE-seq). We identified approximately 80,000 open chromatin sites. Comparison of FAIRE-seq data from islets to that from five non-islet cell lines revealed approximately 3,300 physically linked clusters of islet-selective open chromatin sites, which typically encompassed single genes that have islet-specific expression. We mapped sequence variants to open chromatin sites and found that rs7903146, a TCF7L2 intronic variant strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, is located in islet-selective open chromatin. We found that human islet samples heterozygous for rs7903146 showed allelic imbalance in islet FAIRE signals and that the variant alters enhancer activity, indicating that genetic variation at this locus acts in cis with local chromatin and regulatory changes. These findings illuminate the tissue-specific organization of cis-regulatory elements and show that FAIRE-seq can guide the identification of regulatory variants underlying disease susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2091545998,"Satellite cells are resident myogenic progenitors in postnatal skeletal muscle involved in muscle postnatal growth and adult regenerative capacity. Here, we identify and describe a population of muscle-resident stem cells, which are located in the interstitium, that express the cell stress mediator PW1 but do not express other markers of muscle stem cells such as Pax7. PW1(+)/Pax7(-) interstitial cells (PICs) are myogenic in vitro and efficiently contribute to skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo as well as generating satellite cells and PICs. Whereas Pax7 mutant satellite cells show robust myogenic potential, Pax7 mutant PICs are unable to participate in myogenesis and accumulate during postnatal growth. Furthermore, we found that PICs are not derived from a satellite cell lineage. Taken together, our findings uncover a new and anatomically identifiable population of muscle progenitors and define a key role for Pax7 in a non-satellite cell population during postnatal muscle growth."

We present a probabilistic network (AraNet) of functional associations among 19,647 (73%) genes of the reference flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. AraNet associations are predictive for diverse biological pathways, and outperform predictions derived only from literature-based protein interactions, achieving 21% precision for 55% of genes. AraNet prioritizes genes for limited-scale functional screening, resulting in a hit-rate tenfold greater than screens of random insertional mutants, when applied to early seedling development as a test case. By interrogating network neighborhoods, we identify AT1G80710 (now DROUGHT SENSITIVE 1; DRS1) and AT3G05090 (now LATERAL ROOT STIMULATOR 1; LRS1) as regulators of drought sensitivity and lateral root development, respectively.

The authors identify mutations in PNKP that result in this severe disease and show that PNKP mutations disrupt DNA repair. Maintenance of DNA integrity is crucial for all cell types, but neurons are particularly sensitive to mutations in DNA repair genes, which lead to both abnormal development and neurodegeneration1. We describe a previously unknown autosomal recessive disease characterized by microcephaly, early-onset, intractable seizures and developmental delay (denoted MCSZ). Using genome-wide linkage analysis in consanguineous families, we mapped the disease locus to chromosome 19q13.33 and identified multiple mutations in PNKP (polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase) that result in severe neurological disease; in contrast, a splicing mutation is associated with more moderate symptoms. Unexpectedly, although the cells of individuals carrying this mutation are sensitive to radiation and other DNA-damaging agents, no such individual has yet developed cancer or immunodeficiency. Unlike other DNA repair defects that affect humans, PNKP mutations universally cause severe seizures. The neurological abnormalities in individuals with MCSZ may reflect a role for PNKP in several DNA repair pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2140197300,"Hepatitis C virus research is hampered by the inability to detect individual infected cells. Jones et al. achieve this by imaging the translocation of a fluorescent reporter protein after cleavage by a viral protease in living or fixed cells. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), which infects 2–3% of the world population, is a causative agent of chronic hepatitis and the leading indication for liver transplantation1. The ability to propagate HCV in cell culture (HCVcc) is a relatively recent breakthrough and a key tool in the quest for specific antiviral therapeutics. Monitoring HCV infection in culture generally involves bulk population assays, use of genetically modified viruses and/or terminal processing of potentially precious samples. Here we develop a cell-based fluorescent reporter system that allows sensitive distinction of individual HCV-infected cells in live or fixed samples. We demonstrate use of this technology for several previously intractable applications, including live-cell imaging of viral propagation and host response, as well as visualizing infection of primary hepatocyte cultures. Integration of this reporter with modern image-based analysis methods could open new doors for HCV research."
https://openalex.org/W2144868947,"The sensory areas of the cerebral cortex possess multiple topographic representations of sensory dimensions. The gradient of frequency selectivity (tonotopy) is the dominant organizational feature in the primary auditory cortex, whereas other feature-based organizations are less well established. We probed the topographic organization of the mouse auditory cortex at the single-cell level using in vivo two-photon Ca(2+) imaging. Tonotopy was present on a large scale but was fractured on a fine scale. Intensity tuning, which is important in level-invariant representation, was observed in individual cells, but was not topographically organized. The presence or near absence of putative subthreshold responses revealed a dichotomy in topographic organization. Inclusion of subthreshold responses revealed a topographic clustering of neurons with similar response properties, whereas such clustering was absent in supra-threshold responses. This dichotomy indicates that groups of nearby neurons with locally shared inputs can perform independent parallel computations in the auditory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2040575339,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib are effective therapies against mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Treatment is limited by the development of resistance in part explained by the gain of a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, at the gatekeeper residue. Irreversible EGFR inhibitors, including PF00299804, are effective in vitro and in vivo against EGFR mutant tumors that contain EGFR T790M and are currently under clinical development. In this study, we generate models of resistance to PF00299804, using cell lines with EGFR T790M and show that the PF00299804-resistant models develop focal amplification of EGFR that preferentially involves the T790M-containing allele. These PF00299804-resistant cell lines remain dependent on EGFR for growth as downregulation of EGFR by shRNA compromises their viability. We show that resistance to PF00299804 arises, at least in part, through selection of a pre-existing EGFR T790M-amplified clone both in vitro and using a xenograft model in vivo. Our findings show that EGFR T790M is a common resistance mechanism to both reversible, and when amplified, the irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors further emphasizing the need to develop more potent therapies against EGFR T790M. These findings can be used to guide studies of patient tumor specimens from ongoing clinical trials of irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors."

Rao N.N. Ault-Riché D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 89-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Poly P performs multiple physiological functions, which are distinct and dependent on the type of organism and the subcellular localization of the polymer. In microorganisms, poly P primarily plays a role in transcription. Additionally, poly P serves as an energy store (2.Beauvoit B. Rigoulet M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Guérin B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11212-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and as a reserve pool of inorganic phosphates (3.Akiyama M. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 89-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), poly P synthesis has been detected in intact mammalian cells. Lysis of mammalian cells leads to loss of poly P synthesis activity, suggesting that poly P synthesis in mammalian cells is likely an energy-dependent process linked to membrane transport and integrity (1.Kornberg A. Rao N.N. Ault-Riché D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 89-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 9.Kumble K.D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5818-5822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Taking into account that the membrane potential generated at the mitochondrial inner membrane is a major energy source for cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that mitochondria may be the likely source of poly P production in mammalian cells. Poly P is found in mammalian cells at significantly lower levels when compared with microorganisms (9.Kumble K.D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5818-5822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); therefore, it is very difficult to adapt poly P measurement methods developed for bacterial studies for the study of mammalian cells. Recently we developed a protocol, which we optimized for suitability for measuring low amounts of poly P using the fluorescent probe 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (10.Aschar-Sobbi R. Abramov A.Y. Diao C. Kargacin M.E. Kargacin G.J. French R.J. Pavlov E. J. Fluoresc. 2008; 18: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In our previous study we used this method to confirm poly P hydrolyzing activity of yeast polyphosphatase expressed in mitochondria of mammalian cultured cells (8.Abramov A.Y. Fraley C. Diao C.T.

Here we take advantage of this tool to examine real time changes in poly P amounts in mammalian cultured cells, as well as in isolated mitochondria. The aim of this study was to establish key pathways for poly P metabolism in mammalian cells and elucidate how production of mitochondrial poly P is related to energy metabolism and consumption. Another study attempted to assess poly P changes in mammalian mitochondria using isolated rat liver mitochondria in the early 1960's, but lead to inconclusive results, presumably due to insufficient sensitivity and reliability of assay methods available at that time (11.Lynn W.S. Brown R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 11: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12.Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to our knowledge this is the first study that addresses the issue of poly P metabolism in mammalian mitochondria. Isolated cortical astrocytes were prepared as previously described (13.Abramov A.Y. Jacobson J. Wientjes F. Hothersall J. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9176-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cerebra taken from 2–5-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (UCL breeding colony) or 4-day-old mice were used. The cerebra were chopped and triturated until homogenous, passed through a 297-μm mesh, and trypsinized (50,000 units ml−1 porcine pancreas, Sigma) with 336 units ml−1 DNase I (bovine pancreas, Sigma), and 1.033 units ml−1 collagenase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 15 min. After the addition of fetal bovine serum (10% of final volume) and filtering through 140-μm mesh, the tissue was centrifuged through 0.4 m sucrose (400 g, 10 min), and the resulting pellet transferred to minimal essential medium, which was supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm malate in tissue culture flasks pre-coated with 0.01% poly-d-lysine. The cells reached confluency at 12–14 days in vitro and were harvested and reseeded onto glass coverslips precoated with 0.01% poly-d-lysine for fluorescence measurements and used at 2–4 days. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as previously described (7.Pavlov E. Zakharian E. Bladen C. Diao C.T. Grimbly C. Reusch R.N. French R.J. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2614-2625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Liver from one Sprague-Dawley rat was homogenized using Teflon-glass homogenizer and resuspended in 50 ml of isolation buffer, which contained 70 mm sucrose, 230 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. Unbroken cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and spun at 8500 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in 10 ml of the isolation buffer without EGTA. Functional activity of mitochondrial preparations were tested by measuring the oxygen consumption following activation of the respiratory chain by addition of succinate (5 mm) in the presence of rotenone (5 μm) in a buffer solution containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, using a Clark oxygen electrode (Rank Brothers). DAPI fluorescence was measured using a DeltaRAM V fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). All recordings for isolated mitochondria were done in a plastic cuvette with 2 ml of buffer solution containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0. A silicone stirrer was used to continuously mix the recording solution during fluorescence measurements. DAPI stock solution was prepared in water to the final concentration of 20 mm DAPI. Stock solutions of poly P standards (sodium salt with poly P content of 60% (provided by Dr. T. Shiba Regenetiss, Inc., Japan)) were prepared in recording buffer to final concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml or 50 μg/ml. DAPI and poly P additions were made directly to the cuvette containing the recording buffer. For all results presented here, the total amount of poly P added to the cuvette is reported. For fluorescence spectra, 1 μg of poly P corresponds to the 6 μm expressed in orthophosphates. In our control experiments, similar fluorescent changes were detected using mitochondria amounts ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mg of protein/ml, which suggests that the observed effects are not caused by changes in fluorescence due to spectroscopic artifacts of added mitochondria. For the DAPI experiments presented in this study, mitochondria were added to the recording solution at a concentration defined by a protein content of 0.5 mg/ml. Alternatively, spectra were collected with a Fluorolog-3 with a dual excitation monochrometer to alleviate scattering artifacts (Jobin-Yvon Horriba, NJ). For imaging of poly P, [Mg2+]c and Δψm cells were loaded for 30 min at room temperature with 0.5 μm DAPI (Molecular Probes) or MagFura-2 AM (with 0.005% Pluronic) in a Hepes-buffered salt solution containing (in mm units): 156 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 MgSO4, 1.25 KH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.35, with NaOH. For measurement of Δψm, 20 nm tetramethylrhodamine methylester (Molecular Probes) was added into the cultures 40 min prior to the experiment. Fluorescence measurements of MagFura were obtained using an Olympus epifluorescence inverted microscope with a ×20 fluorite objective. Excitation light from a xenon arc lamp was selected using a monochromator at 340 and 380 nm (Cairn Research, Faversham, UK). Emitted light passed through a long-pass filter to a cooled CCD camera (Retiga, QImaging, Canada) and digitized to a 12-bit resolution (Digital Pixel Ltd., UK). All imaging data were collected and analyzed using software from Andor (Belfast, UK). Cells were protected from phototoxicity by interposing a shutter in the light path to limit exposure between acquisition of successive images. Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss 510 CLSM equipped with a META detection system and a ×40 oil immersion objective. A 543-nm laser line and a 560-nm long pass filter were used to obtain tetramethylrhodamine methylester measurements. DAPI emission spectra were measured using 405 nm laser for excitation. The specific DAPI-poly P emission signal was measured above 550 nm, using the Zeiss “META” system and presented as arbitrary units. Illumination intensity was kept to a minimum (at 0.1% of laser output) to avoid phototoxicity and the pinhole was set to give an optical slice of ∼2 μm. All data presented were obtained from at least 5 coverslips and from 2 to 3 different cell preparations. Ca2+ uptake by isolated canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was monitored using Fura-2 as previously described (14.Beca S. Aschar-Sobbi R. Ponjevic D. Winkfein R.J. Kargacin M.E. Kargacin G.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 490: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). 100 μg of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were continuously stirred in a cuvette with 2 ml of uptake buffer containing: 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm oxalate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, in the presence of 2.9 μm Fura-2. Uptake was initiated by the addition of 1.5 mm NaATP, 1.5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.4 units/ml of creatine phosphokinase. Fura-2 fluorescence signals (alternating 340/380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission) were measured at 1-s intervals. Cell luminescence was measured in a home built luminometer. Cells (400,000–600,000 per coverslip) were constantly perfused with a modified Krebs-Ringer buffer containing: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 μm luciferin, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, supplemented with either 5.5 mm glucose or 0.1 mm pyruvate, 1 mm lactate. Under these conditions, the light output of a coverslip of transfected cells was in the range of 500 counts/s for each measurement versus a background lower than 5 counts/s. Luminescence was entirely dependent on the presence of luciferin and proportional to the perfused luciferin concentration ∼50 μm. Acid-soluble and salt-soluble poly P fractions were extracted at 4 °C with 0.5 n HClO4 and a saturated solution of NaClO4 in 1 n HClO4, respectively. The remaining biomass was treated with 0.5 n HClO4 for 30 min at 90 °C, and the level of acid-insoluble poly P fraction was measured by the amount of released Pi (15.Vagabov V.M. Trilisenko L.V. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 65: 349-354PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotides were removed from the acid-soluble fraction by adsorption to Norit A charcoal (16.Ault-Riché D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of poly P in the acid-soluble and salt-soluble poly P fractions was calculated as a difference in the Pi amount before and after hydrolysis of samples in the presence of 1 n HCl for 10 min at 100 °C (labile phosphorus). The DE81 filter paper treatment was used in parallel to estimate the amount of poly P (17.Rao N.N. Liu S. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2186-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined as described in Ref. 18.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Extracted poly P was subjected to electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 7 m urea. The gel was stained with toluidine blue (9.Kumble K.D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5818-5822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Poly P with chain lengths of P14, 60, and 130 (Regenetiss Inc., Japan) were used as standards. Statistical analysis and exponential curve fitting were performed using Origin 8 software (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Curve fitting was performed using Sigma Plot software with the following functions: y = a × x + b and y = Y0 + a × exp(−b × x) for analysis of reaction kinetics, and y = a × exp(−0.5 ×((x-X0)/b)∧2) for spectral analysis. To investigate the role of poly P in cell energy metabolism, we utilized the modified the DAPI fluorescence measurement of poly P, and monitored the changes in poly P levels in response to activators and inhibitors of cellular metabolism. Application of 1 μm FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a mitochondrial uncoupler that dissipates mitochondrial membrane potential) to the astrocytes induced a decrease of 58.7 ± 4.1% in DAPI-poly P fluorescence in the mitochondrial area (n = 47; p < 0.001; Fig. 1A). FCCP also reduced the DAPI fluorescence signal in the cytosolic area (data not shown), suggesting an actual decrease in the amount of poly P by the protonophore, rather than a redistribution of poly P from the mitochondria to other cellular compartments. FCCP caused a complete depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, which resulted in induction of the maximal rate of respiration and inhibited production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, FCCP stimulated ATP consumption by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase and the release of Ca2+ from the mitochondria into the cytosol (19.Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The observed decrease in the amount of poly P after FCCP addition suggests that the poly P metabolism in astrocytes is linked to the ability of the cells to produce ATP and/or the possibility that the poly P concentration is linked to the ability of the mitochondria to maintain their membrane potential. The addition of 20 μm iodoacetic acid (IAA), an inhibitor of glycolysis, significantly reduced DAPI-poly P fluorescence in both mitochondrial (by 43.5 ± 3.7%; Fig. 1 B) and cytosolic (by 42.4 ± 2.7%; data not shown) areas of cortical astrocytes (n = 56; p < 0.05). Because glycolysis provides substrates for mitochondrial respiratory complexes; it is possible that the level of poly P in these cells depends on the activity of the respiratory chain. Application of 5 mm glutamate or pyruvate, substrates for complex I, increased fluorescence of DAPI-poly P by 23.1 ± 1.7%, n = 47 (21.5 ± 0.9%, for pyruvate). Subsequent inhibition of complex I with 10 μm rotenone decreased the DAPI-poly P signal by 34.6 ± 3.2% as compared with control. Activation of respiration with addition of 5 mm methyl succinate (Me-succinate), a membrane permeable analogue of succinate and a substrate for complex II, increased the poly P level by 27.4 ± 1.9% (Fig. 1C). The observed effects of FCCP, IAA, mitochondrial substrates, and rotenone support the idea that the rate of production and consumption of poly P depends on the activity of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery. We also observed that the rate of changes in DAPI-poly P fluorescence was dependent on mitochondrial substrates, inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. We should note here that fluorescent measurements do not allow us to quantitatively estimate the amount of poly P present in mitochondria. However, in vitro experiments indicate that DAPI fluorescence responds linearly to the amount of poly P present (10.Aschar-Sobbi R. Abramov A.Y. Diao C. Kargacin M.E. Kargacin G.J. French R.J. Pavlov E. J. Fluoresc. 2008; 18: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the kinetics of DAPI fluorescence change reflect the kinetics of relative poly P change and can be used for calculations of rates of poly P flux in levels. The rate of changes in DAPI-poly P fluorescence under application of substrates for complex I was higher (61.4 ± 5.9 arbitrary units/min for pyruvate; 60.6 ± 5.6 arbitrary units/min for glutamate comparing to 51.2 ± 4.1 arbitrary units/min for Me-succinate; Fig. 1D), although this difference is not considered significant. Note that IAA and rotenone induced a faster decrease of the poly P level in comparison to FCCP and oligomycin (Fig. 1D). The effect of the F1F0-ATP synthetase inhibitor oligomycin on the level of poly P was dependent on cell type. Application of oligomycin (2 μg/ml) to HEK cells induced a large increase in DAPI-poly P fluorescence (n = 44; Fig. 2A). Interestingly, when the same inhibitor was added to primary astrocytes, the DAPI-poly P signal decreased by 54.6 ± 3.6% (n = 71, p < 0.001; Fig. 2B; see also Fig. 1C). We further investigated the differences seen between these two types of cells in response to the addition of oligomycin by measuring the effects of oligomycin on mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) using the potentially sensitive dye tetramethylrhodamine methylester. Addition of oligomycin to cortical astrocytes resulted in “classical” hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane (n = 39, Fig. 2D). On the other hand, oligomycin addition to HEK cells induces depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane (n = 41; Fig. 2C). In cells with normal oxidative phosphorylation, the Δψm is maintained by the proton pumping activity of the respiratory chain. However, if respiration is impaired, hydrolysis of ATP by the F1F0-ATPase (complex V) may take over, pumping protons across the inner membrane and thus maintaining Δψm (20.Campanella M. Casswell E. Chong S. Farah Z. Wieckowski M.R. Abramov A.Y. Tinker A. Duchen M.R. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that in HEK cells, oligomycin inhibits ATP consumption, which leads to an increase in the poly P level. Conversely, in cortical astrocytes, oligomycin inhibits ATP production, which results in a decrease in the level of poly P. These observations further support the notion that the level of poly P in mammalian cells is directly dependent on the level of ATP. To obtain further insight into the kinetics of poly P metabolism, we attempted to measure rate constants of chemical reactions responsible for these changes. Taking into account that current work deals with the whole organelle in an intact cell rather than purified enzyme(s), it is impossible to tell at this level how many enzymes are involved in the process, and which substrates are potentially used for the synthesis. For this reason, results of rate constant measurements should be taken with care, as we cannot tell how many reactions are potentially involved in the process and the order of these reactions. Despite these difficulties, we were able to find significant differences in the kinetics of poly P hydrolysis depending on the applied conditions of study. In our analysis on the kinetics of poly P hydrolysis we tested two possibilities: 1) zero order reaction, which will take place if the poly P polymer binds to the enzyme and is not released until the whole molecule is hydrolyzed, in this case enzymatic cleavage of poly P will be the rate-limiting factor and decease of fluorescence should follow zero order linear kinetics; 2) a first order reaction that would take place if poly P is used as a substrate for some other reaction and becomes bound and released after cleavage of a single orthophosphate. We have found that kinetics of poly P hydrolysis induced by addition of FCCP (Fig. 1A) or IAA (Fig. 1B) follows a first order reaction and can be well fitted with a single exponential, but not with a linear function. With this model reaction rate constants were 0.25 ± 0.04 min−1 for FCCP and 0.66 ± 0.04 min−1 for IAA. To the contrary, application of oligomycin stimulated poly P hydrolysis with kinetics, which were best fit with linear rather than exponential function. This suggested zero order kinetics of this reaction with rate constants of 12 ± 1 min−1 for experiments shown at Fig. 1C and 9.9 ± 0.4 min−1 for the experiment shown at Fig. 2B. Overall, these results allow us to suggest that the mechanism of poly P hydrolysis in the presence of the F1F0-ATPase inhibitor is fundamentally different. These results support the idea of direct involvement of F1F0-ATPase in the process of poly P metabolism. Additionally, they contribute significantly to the notion that poly P hydrolysis under conditions of the respiratory chain are uncoupled or inhibited. To ensure that our observations were not simply due to changes in DAPI fluorescence in response to changes in ATP levels, we determined how the presence of ATP as well as ADP might affect the fluorescence of DAPI-poly P. The DAPI fluorescence spectrum was measured in vitro using a fluorimeter in the presence of ATP and poly P. For these experiments, the excitation wavelength was set at 405 nm, which corresponds to the excitation wavelength used in the confocal fluorescence experiments. The intensity of DAPI fluorescence can be modulated by a variety of compounds, but only DAPI bound to poly P demonstrates a specific shift in both the excitation and emission spectra (21.Tijssen J.P. Beekes H.W. Van Steveninck J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 721: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This property of DAPI is determined by the unique, high density distribution of negative charges found only in poly P. In our experimental conditions, changes in the DAPI fluorescence induced by non-poly P compounds are most prominent at 475 nm, whereas fluorescence changes induced by poly P binding to DAPI are further red shifted and thus best detectable at 550 nm. As shown in Fig. 3, addition of ATP (1.25 mm) increased the intensity at both 475 and 550 nm fluorescence emissions. However, subsequent addition of 1 μg (6 μm) of poly P induces a large increase in the 550-nm fluorescence intensity, and a small decrease in the 475-nm fluorescence, consistent with a poly P-induced shift of DAPI fluorescence. Addition of hexokinase, which converts ATP to ADP, decreased the fluorescence intensity at 475 nm, whereas the signal at 550 nm remained virtually unchanged, indicating that the fluorescence intensity at 550 nm is independent of the ratio between ATP and ADP. These experiments demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity changes at 475 nm provide reliable estimates of the fluorescence change induced by nonspecific DAPI interactions, whereas fluorescence changes at 550 nm reflect a specific change in DAPI fluorescence due to poly P interaction with DAPI. We further confirmed the results we obtained in intact cells using isolated mitochondria and monitoring the DAPI fluorescence simultaneously at both 475 and 550 nm with excitation at 415 nm. Stimulation of mitochondrial respiration with substrates for respiratory complex II (succinate, 5 mm) + phosphate (1 mm) in the presence of rotenone (5 μm) significantly increased poly P-dependent DAPI fluorescence (550 nm) with no changes in the 475-nm emission fluorescence (Fig. 4A; n = 5). These results confirmed the dependence of poly P synthesis on activity of the mitochondrial respiration. The relative contribution of mitochondrial complexes and respiration in general to poly P homeostasis can be estimated by the effects of added substrates or the presence of respiratory chain inhibitors on DAPI fluorescence. Application of 5 mm glutamate, a substrate for complex I, to mitochondria increased the level of DAPI-poly P by 12 ± 4% (n = 5, p < 0.01; Fig. 4B). Addition of rotenone (5 μm) decreased DAPI fluorescence but, interestingly, not to basal levels. Subsequent addition of substrate for complex II (succinate, 5 mm) not only restored, but also increased the level of poly P in the mitochondria (26 ± 10%, n = 7; p < 0.001). Addition of a mitochondrial uncoupler, CCCP (1 μm), reduced DAPI-poly P fluorescence by 13 ± 4% (n = 4; p < 0.01) but, again, not to basal levels (Fig. 4B). The experiments described in this section were done in the presence of phosphate and absence of ADP. It is established that under these conditions the mitochondrial respiratory chain is active, but its activity is not coupled to ATP production (22.Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 429-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our control experiments conducted in the absence of ADP, addition of succinate induced a 2.5 ± 1-fold (n = 3) increase of the rate of respiration. This rate was 34 ± 8% (n = 3) of the maximal rate of mitochondrial respiration achieved in the presence of CCCP. Thus, the level of poly P in mitochondria is dependent on the activity of mitochondrial respiration and not the production of ATP. These results suggest that mitochondria do not use ATP as a substrate for poly P synthesis. Fig. 4C shows the application of rotenone and succinate to mitochondria in the presence of oligomycin. Under these conditions the effect of substrates of respiration on DAPI fluorescence in mitochondria was completely abolished. This suggests that in mammalian mitochondria poly P production is closely related to the activity of the oligomycin-dependent F1F0-ATP synthase. To confirm that DAPI fluorescence changes reflect changes in poly P amount, rather than its complex formation with other molecules, we compared the total amount of poly P in succinate-stimulated mitochondria in the presence and absence of CCCP using a biochemical assay. It is important to note that it was not possible to do similar experiments using tissue culture cells due to the requirement of large amounts of material and sample differences arising from mitochondrial isolation from cell culture. For these experiments poly P was extracted from large"

Despite their ongoing and rapid global decline, there have been few investigations into the immunity mechanisms of reef-building corals. Variables commonly associated with invertebrate immunity, including the presence of melanin, size of melanin-containing granular cells, and phenoloxidase (PO) activity, as well as concentrations of fluorescent proteins (FPs), were investigated in hard (Scleractinia) and soft (Alcyonacea) corals spanning 10 families from the Great Barrier Reef. Detectable levels of these indicators were present in all corals investigated, although relative investment differed among coral taxa. Overall levels of investment were inversely correlated to thermal bleaching and disease susceptibility. In addition, PO activity, melanin-containing granular cell size, and FP concentration were each found to be significant predictors of susceptibility and thus may play key roles in coral immunity. Correlative evidence that taxonomic (family-level) variation in the levels of these constituent immunity parameters underpins susceptibility to both thermal bleaching and disease indicates that baseline immunity underlies the vulnerability of corals to these two threats. This reinforces the necessity of a holistic approach to understanding bleaching and disease in order to accurately determine the resilience of coral reefs. —Palmer, C. V., Bythell, J. C, Willis. B.

https://openalex.org/W2054447098,"SNAP-23 has previously been implicated in exocytosis regulation in non-neuronal cells. Here the authors report that SNAP-23 is also important in neurons, where it is responsible for functional regulation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Regulated exocytosis is essential for many biological processes and many components of the protein trafficking machinery are ubiquitous. However, there are also exceptions, such as SNAP-25, a neuron-specific SNARE protein that is essential for synaptic vesicle release from presynaptic nerve terminals. In contrast, SNAP-23 is a ubiquitously expressed SNAP-25 homolog that is critical for regulated exocytosis in non-neuronal cells. However, the role of SNAP-23 in neurons has not been elucidated. We found that SNAP-23 was enriched in dendritic spines and colocalized with constituents of the postsynaptic density, whereas SNAP-25 was restricted to axons. In addition, loss of SNAP-23 using genetically altered mice or shRNA targeted to SNAP-23 led to a marked decrease in NMDA receptor surface expression and NMDA receptor currents, whereas loss of SNAP-25 did not. SNAP-23 is therefore important for the functional regulation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors."

The reason why ESCs are such a valuable tool is that each stage of early development is recapitulated in the process of ESC differentiation to a specific cell lineage (3.Bradley A. Evans M.

SMCs express a number of smooth muscle-specific genes, referred to as SM markers, which include SM α-actin (SMA), SM22α, calponin, and SM myosin heavy chain (11.Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2556) Google Scholar). SMCs can exhibit a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from the more differentiated “contractile” state in which high levels of SMC differentiation markers are expressed to the less differentiated “synthetic” state in which SMC markers are down-regulated (11.Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2556) Google Scholar, 12.Sartore S. Chiavegato A. Faggin E. Franch R. Puato M. Ausoni S. Pauletto P. Circ.

Alterations in SMC differentiation state play a major role in the development of a number of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, hypertension, and aneurysm (14.Hirschi K.K.

Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that controls SMC differentiation is very important to help develop new ways to prevent and treat these diseases. SMC differentiation has been documented to be tightly regulated through a complex and synergistic combination of 1) DNA binding transcription factors, 2) accessory cofactors for the DNA-binding proteins, and 3) DNA/histone modifications present within promoter chromatin. This multilayered orchestra works to coordinate regulation of the multiple transcriptional programs that underlie differentiation and plasticity of the SMC phenotype (15.McDonald O.G. Owens G.K.

Owens at the University of Virginia) were induced to differentiate into SMCs following the previous report, with minor modification (25.Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, A404 cells were treated with 1 μm RA for 4 days. Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA with Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). cDNA samples were subjected to qRT-PCR amplification using custom primers on an Bio-Rad MyIQ detection system (Bio-Rad) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Quantitative RT-PCR custom primers are described in supplemental Table 1. 18 S RNA served as an internal standard. To measure mature miR expression, total RNA, including mature miRs, was extracted from cultured cells by using the microRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers specific for miRs and U6 (Applied Biosystems) were used, and each mature miR expression was quantified using TaqMan microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, TaqMan microRNA assays include two steps; that is, stem-loop RT followed by real-time PCR. For each 15-μl RT reaction, 10 ng of purified total RNA, 1× RT primer, 1× RT buffer, 1 mm dNTPs, 0.2 units/μl RNase inhibitor, and 3.33 units/μl MultiScribe reverse transcriptase from the TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit were added and incubated for 30 min at 16 °C followed by 30 min of incubation at 42 °C. qRT-PCR was performed using a standard protocol on a Bio-Rad MyIQ System (Bio-Rad). All TaqMan microRNA assays were performed in triplicate. Total RNA input was normalized based on the cycle threshold values of the U6 assay as an endogenous control. The -fold change was calculated based on delta cycle threshold between endogenous U6 control and miR-10a. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed as previously reported (26.Xie C.Q. Zhang J. Villacorta L. Cui T. Huang H. Chen Y.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: e311-e312Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were fixed, permeabilized using a BD Biosciences cytofix/cytopermTM kit, and incubated overnight with anti-SMA antibody (Millipore). Mouse IgG2a served as isotypic control (Dakocytomation), whereas rat vascular SMCs served as positive controls. Goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 was used as the secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Finally, fluorescence was analyzed using the FACSCaliburTM system (BD Biosciences) following the user's guide. To generate the miR-10a-luciferase reporter plasmid, an ∼900-bp fragment (−868 to +110 bp) containing the NF-κB putative binding site was amplified from C57/B6L mouse genomic DNA and then cloned into KpnI and HindIII sites of the pGL4.10 [Luc2] vector (Promega). The following primers were used for cloning the miR-10a promoter: ggaggggtaccagaatcccattttggcca (forward primer) and ggaggaagcttgcggagtgtttatgtcaact (reverse primer). For the construction of the p65mut-miR-10a luciferase plasmid, the NF-κB binding site was mutated from the miR-10a- luciferase construct using QuikChange XL mutagenesis (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used were as follows, resulting in the mutation of the putative NF-κB element (capitalized is the partial mutated region from the predicted miR-10a promoter): NF-κB-mF (forward primer, cttcttctcaggttgtaaacggaattTTTAgtcattaaatatggg) and NF-κB-mR (reverse primer, cccatatttaatgacTAAAaattccgtttacaacctgagaagaag). A DNA fragment containing the HDAC4 3′-UTR sequence with a putative miR-10a binding site was cloned into the SacI and HindIII restriction sites of the pMIR-REPORTTM vector (Promega) to generate the HDAC4–3′-UTR reporter plasmid. Primers used to amplify the DNA fragment containing the HDAC4 3′-UTR from cDNA were HDAC4-F (forward primer, atactcagaagggacatcaag) and HDAC4-F (reverse primer, ccaaggcggccagaagagc). Site-directed mutagenesis against the putative miR-10a binding site located in the HDAC4–3′-UTR was generated by standard PCR to generate the HDAC4-mut-3′-UTR reporter plasmid. Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are as follows: HDAC4-mF (forward primer, ctgaatttggtggcatttacagCCGCgatgggaactgggtcaagc) and HDAC4-mR (reverse primer, gcttgacccagttcccatcGCGGctgtaaatgccaccaaattcag). The final sequences of all constructed plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructed plasmids (0.2 μg of plasmid/well of 24-well plates) together with Renilla luciferase control reporter vector (pRL-TK) were transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega) with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Individual luciferase activity was normalized to the responding TK promoter-Renilla-luciferase activity. Whole cell lysate samples were extracted from cells using the mammalian protein extraction reagent M-Per (Promega) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were obtained using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), SMA (Millipore, 1:3000), SM-myosin heavy chain (SMMHC, BTI, 1:2000), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), and HDAC4 (Abcam, 1:500) were used for testing individual protein expression. Immuno-activity and band density was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) or Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A complex of plasmids or oligonucleotides was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. miR-10a inhibitor and inhibitor negative control were purchased from Dharmacon. These inhibitors are RNA oligonucleotides with novel secondary structure designed to inhibit the function of endogenous miR (27.Ruby J.G. Jan C. Player C. Axtell M.J. Lee W. Nusbaum C. Ge H. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2006; 127: 1193-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). HDAC4, p65, Sp1, and SMAD3 expression plasmids were purchased from Addgene. PathDetect NF-κB Cis-Reporter Plasmid was purchased from Stratagene (NF-κB binding site luciferase). Target genes for miR-10a were predicted using the free software PicTar and TargetScan 4.2 with the cutoff set at p values less than 0.05. Mouse ESCs were treated with 10 μm RA. After 6 h, cellular proteins were cross-linked, and a ChIP assay was performed by using the EZ-ChIP assay kit (Millipore). The size of the sonicated DNA fragments used for immunoprecipitation was between 500 and 1000 bp in length as determined by ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. Purified chromatin was immunoprecipitated using anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Eluted DNA fragments were purified to serve as templates for the PCR amplification. The input fraction corresponded to 2% of the chromatin solution before immunoprecipitation. IgG control serves as the negative control to the p65 antibody. By using rVista software to analyze conserved regions on the pre-mmu-miR-10a promoter, we identified a potential NF-κB binding site, which is located in the −638 to −627-bp region upstream of the transcription start site. The primers used to amplify the area containing this NF-κB binding site are: forward primer (5′-gctgcaacttttatggttcc-3′) and reverse primer 5′-gggagaggtgtctgggtgtg-3′), resulting in a 225-bp fragment. Data were analyzed for statistical significance by the Student-Newman-Keuls test using SYSTAT software (SYSTAT Inc.) with values of p < 0.05 considered to be significant. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times. Recently, we have established the ESC/SMC in vitro differentiation system (7.Xie C. Huang H. Wei S. Song L.S. Zhang J. Ritchie R.P. Chen L. Zhang M. Chen Y.E. Stem Cells Dev. 2009; 18: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether miRs regulate RA-induced ESC/SMC differentiation, we profiled miR expression levels during ESC/SMC differentiation at days 0, 1, and 3 using a TaqMan miR assay. Among 226 commercially available miR primer sets profiled in our assay, the expression levels of 11 miRs were increased, and 7 miRs decreased by more than 3-fold (supplemental Table S2). Interestingly, miR-10a was among the most strongly up-regulated miRs during RA-induced ESC/SMC differentiation (supplemental Table S2). The TaqMan miR assay showed that miR-10a is up-regulated during RA-induced SMC differentiation by ∼20-fold at day 3 and continued to increase during later stages of differentiation (supplemental Fig. S1). DMSO-treated cells also showed moderate up-regulation of miR-10a (5-fold by day 6); however, it was not as remarkable or sustained as the up-regulation observed in the RA-treated cells. The up-regulation observed in the DMSO-treated cells may result from a low percentage of spontaneously differentiated SMC population. To examine the potential role of miR-10a during RA-induced ESC/SMC differentiation, a miR-10a inhibitor was transfected into ESCs. After 24 h of the transfection, ESCs were treated with RA for 3, 6, and 8 days and subjected to analysis of SMC markers by qRT-PCR for mRNA levels and Western blots for protein levels. The miR-10a inhibitor effectively reduced the expression of miR-10a to less than 20% that of control cells transfected with an inhibitor negative control (supplemental Fig. S2A). Intriguingly, when mature miR-10a levels were repressed, SMC marker expression during RA-induced ESC/SMC differentiation dramatically declined (Fig. 1, A and B) and differentiation efficiency to SMCs reduced, as evidenced by a decreased percentage of SMA-positive cell population in the derived cells (61.73 ± 3.38% in miR-10a inhibitor group versus 87.45 ± 2.45% in miR negative control, p < 0.05, Fig. 1C). In addition, no effect on other cell lineage-specific marker expression was observed during miR-10a repression in the context of this ESC/SMC differentiation system by day 6 (supplemental Fig. S2B). Interestingly, miR-10a expression was also up-regulated upon the RA treatment in the A404-SMC differentiation system (supplemental Fig. S3A). Furthermore, blockage of miR-10a expression with miR-10a inhibitor impaired SMC differentiation in this A404 system, as evidenced by down-regulation of SMC-specific markers (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Taken together, these results suggest that miR-10a is important for the RA-induced SMC differentiation process, probably by targeting specific genes involved in the SMC phenotype. To better understand the miR-10a-dependent molecular mechanism regulating SMC differentiation, we performed a bioinformatics search for targets that might mediate this effect. Remarkably, one of the targets consistently predicted by two different algorithms, TargetScan 4.0 (28.Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4188) Google Scholar) and PicTar (29.Krek A. Grün D. Poy M.N. Wolf R. Rosenberg L. Epstein E.J. MacMenamin P. da Piedade I. Gunsalus K.C. Stoffel M. Rajewsky N. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar), was HDAC4. The predicted hybridization site was to a seed sequence in the HDAC4 3′-UTR that is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrate species (supplemental Fig. S4A). This result suggests that miR-10a may act to suppress HDAC4 and its activity during SMC differentiation. Secondary structure analysis also showed a favorable minimum free energy (−29.1 kcal/mol) in the formation of the miR-10a; HDAC4 3′-UTR duplex stem-loop (supplemental Fig. S4B). Consistent with this prediction, our results uncovered an inverse relationship between miR-10a expression and HDAC4 protein levels (supplemental Fig. S4C) during ESC/SMC differentiation without a significant change of HDAC4 mRNA levels (supplemental Fig. S4D). Furthermore, down-regulation of HDAC4 protein level was rescued when mature miR-10a expression was blocked by miR-10a inhibitor in this ESC/SMC differentiation system (Fig. 2A), without changes to HDAC4 mRNA levels (data not shown). This result is consistent with the functional prediction that miR-10a binding to the HDAC4 3′-UTR would lead to HDAC4 translational repression. We next tested whether HDAC4 was a target for repression by miR-10a by cloning a fragment of the HDAC4 3′-UTR, containing either wild type or a mutant (mut) miR-10a binding site, downstream from the firefly luciferase gene in the pMIR- ReportTM vector (supplemental Fig. S4A). Co-transfections of miR-10a mimic with the HDAC4–3′-UTR reporter resulted in the repression of luciferase activity when compared with the mimic negative control (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the HDAC4-mut-3′-UTR reporter was not repressed by miR-10a mimic. Neither mutation of the putative miR-10a complementary seed sequence nor the miR mimic negative control repressed luciferase activity, indicating that the repression was specific for miR-10a binding. Although HDAC4 has been shown to mediate platelet-derived growth factor-BB pro-proliferation of SMCs (30.Yoshida T. Gan Q. Shang Y. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C886-C895Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the function of HDAC4 on ESC/SMC differentiation is unclear. To further explore the function of HDAC4 on SMC differentiation in this differentiation system, the down-regulated HDAC4 expression was rescued by transient transfection of a HDAC4 expression plasmid in mouse ESCs, and subsequently, transfected cells were induced to differentiate with RA. As shown in Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S5, A–C, the expression of SMC-specific markers, including SM myosin heavy chain and SMA on both mRNA and protein levels, were significantly reduced after HDAC4 overexpression. Taken together, these results indicate that miR-10a represses the expression of HDAC4 at the post-transcriptional level during ESC/SMC differentiation, thus preventing its HDAC4-antimyogenic effects. Although the effects of miRs on the regulation of their targets have been extensively studied, the transcriptional regulation of miRs themselves is only beginning to be elucidated. In this study, we were particularly interested in the transcriptional regulation of the miR-10a gene. We used rVISTA (31.Loots G.G. Ovcharenko I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W217-W221Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) to find potential transcription factor binding sites within ∼1 kb upstream region of the miR-10a gene, which is conserved among species (supplemental Fig. S6A). One NF-κB consensus binding site was identified in −638 to −627 bp upstream of the miR-10a gene (supplemental Fig. S6A). This 1-kb miR-10a promoter also contains several conserved cis-elements for other transcription factors, including Sp1 and SMAD3. Among these transcription factors, p65 was shown to be able to transactivate the miR-10a promoter (Fig. 3A). To test whether p65 could bind to the predicted NF-κB binding site in the miR-10a promoter, either the wild type or the mutated p65 binding site miR-10a-luciferase reporter plasmid was individually transfected into HEK 293 cells together with the p65 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3B, p65 was able to enhance miR-10a-luciferase reporter activity. However, when the p65 binding site was mutated, p65 could no longer activate the expression of the miR-10a-luciferase reporter. In addition, the mature miR-10a expression in HEK 293 was significantly increased by overexpression of p65 in a separate experiment (data no shown). Moreover, p65 nuclear translocation inhibitor, pyrrolinedithiocarbamate, reduced miR-10a expression levels and negatively regulated SMC differentiation marker expression, as shown in Fig. 3, C and D. To determine whether NF-κB binding sites are a direct target of RA signaling, we used a plasmid containing the NF-κB binding element followed by the luciferase reporter gene (referred to as NF-κB binding site luciferase). As shown in Fig. 4A, NF-κB binding site luciferase reporter activity was increased by RA treatment in HEK 293 cells as determined by luciferase reporter assay (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the expression of a list of NF-κB target genes was up-regulated in ESCs in response to RA treatment (supplemental Fig. S6B). To determine whether NF-κB binds to the miR-10a promoter in response to RA, a ChIP assay was performed with extracts prepared from mouse ESCs treated with RA for 6 h. Results indicated that RA treatment can induce NF-κB binding to its consensus element in the miR-10a promoter (Fig. 4B). In summary, RA can promote nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which then binds to the miR-10a promoter and enhances miR-10a expression, consequently modulating SMC differentiation. In this study we investigated the function of miRs during SMC differentiation from ESCs. The results shown here revealed that RA triggered NF-κB nuclear translocation, which in turn leads to up-regulation of NF-κB target genes including miR-10a. Furthermore, up-regulated miR-10a enhanced SMC differentiation via repression of HDAC4, which is a negative regulator of SMC differentiation. Thus, our data have demonstrated that miR-10a is a novel regulator in SMC differentiation from ESCs. The miR-10a gene and mature miR-10a sequence are highly evolutionarily conserved. The function of miR-10a has been indicated in apoptosis (32.Ovcharenko D. Kelnar K. Johnson C. Leng N. Brown D.

Although miR-10a has been shown to be highly expressed in rat artery and slightly down-regulated by day 7 after angioplasty (18.Ji R. Cheng Y. Yue J. Yang J. Liu X. Chen H. Dean D.B. Zhang C. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), there is no further literature available dissecting the intrinsic relationship between miR-10a and SMC differentiation. Here, we provide novel evidence showing that miR-10a is induced during SMC differentiation from both ESCs and A404, whereas the miR-10a inhibitor dramatically repressed SMC differentiation. These results indicate that miR-10a expression can modulate SMC differentiation. Interestingly, miR-10a mimic per se cannot drive SMC differentiation in the absence of RA treatment (data no shown), which implies that miR-10a up-regulation is elegantly integrated in harmony with other regulatory mechanisms operating during RA-induced SMC differentiation. As previously reported (35.Tzur G. Levy A. Meiri E. Barad O. Spector Y. Bentwich Z. Mizrahi L. Katzenellenbogen M. Ben-Shushan E. Reubinoff B.E. Galun E.

PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), there is a list of miRs that show the same dynamic change as miR-10a during the differentiation of ESCs. More studies are needed to unravel the function of these miRs during this differentiation process. We also showed that the molecular mechanism by which miR-10a function to modulate SMC differentiation is by targeting HDAC4. Here we showed an inverse relationship in the expression pattern between miR-10a and HDAC4 during ESC/SMC differentiation. Luciferase assays further demonstrated that the mature miR-10a was able to bind to the ACAGGGU seed sequence in the HDAC4 3′-UTR. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-10a expression resulted in up-regulation of HDAC4 protein levels. Remarkably, HDAC4 was consistently predicted by two algorithms, TargetScan (28.Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4188) Google Scholar) and PicTar (29.Krek A. Grün D. Poy M.N. Wolf R. Rosenberg L. Epstein E.J. MacMenamin P. da Piedade I. Gunsalus K.C. Stoffel M. Rajewsky N. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar), as a target of miR-10a. HDACs are part of a vast family of enzymes that have critical roles in diverse biological processes, largely through transcriptional repression (45.Haberland M. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Results of several previous studies have shown HDAC4 negative function in terms of SMC differentiation. For example, the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A has been shown to increase the activity of the SM22α gene in 10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts (46.Qiu P. Li L. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies have shown that HDAC4 can be recruited to enhance the platelet-derived growth factor-BB-mediated repression of SM α-actin gene expression (30.Yoshida T. Gan Q. Shang Y. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C886-C895Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) through the activation of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) pathway (47.Zhou X. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, HDAC4 has been shown to interact with serum response factor (48.Davis F.J. Gupta M. Camoretti-Mercado B. Schwartz R.J. Gupta M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20047-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and its coactivator myocardin (49.Cao D. Wang Z. Zhang C.L. Oh J. Xing W. Li S. Richardson J.A. Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here we showed that overexpression of HDAC4 inhibited ESC/SMC differentiation, as shown by the down-regulated expression of SMC markers. However, the detailed mechanism through which HDAC4 is able to regulate SMC differentiation in this ESC/SMC differentiation system remains to be determined. The data shown here indicate that miR-10a mediates its positive effects in the modulation of SMC differentiation by targeting HDAC4. However, it is difficult to know whether the effects of miR-10a on SMC differentiation is primarily mediated through HDAC4 or whether HDAC4 could serve simultaneously as a target for miR-10a and other co-regulatory miRs. It should be noted that overexpression or inhibition of miR-10a could have also affected other cell factors in the differentiating cultures. Further studies are needed to identify and characterize additional miR-10a target genes. Although miR biology has been greatly advanced in the last few years, much of the effort has focused on exploring the targets of miRs rather than understanding the regulation of miR genes themselves. To determine cis regulatory elements in volved in the up-regulation of miR-10a, we have documented for the first time that NF-κB can bind to a consensus site on the miR-10a promoter region and transactivate miR-10a expression. The NF-κB family of transcription factors is essential in a broad range of physiological processes, including immunity, inflammation, development, and differentiation (50.Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar, 51.Perkins N.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Recent data suggests that NF-κB plays a role in proliferation, migration, and differentiation of stem cells (52.Widera D. Mikenberg I. Kaltschmidt B. Kaltschmidt C. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the NF-κB pathway is up-regulated upon withdrawal of LIF and that impaired NF-κB signaling delays loss of pluripotency markers (53.Magness S.T. Jijon H. Van Houten Fisher N. Sharpless N.E. Brenner D.A. Jobin C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The NF-κB activity has also been shown to be inhibited in undifferentiated ES cells by Nanog (one of critical transcription factors to maintain stem cell pluripotency) and up-regulated during differentiation to function as a positive differentiation stimulus (53.Magness S.T. Jijon H. Van Houten Fisher N. Sharpless N.E. Brenner D.A. Jobin C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 54.Torres J. Watt F.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the finding that the activation of NF-κB may contribute to changes in cell adhesion and cytokine production during ESC differentiation (55.Narayanan R.

Here, our data have showed that RA can induce the expression of NF-κB target genes including miR-10a in ESCs. Inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation blocked miR-10a up-regulation and impaired SMC differentiation as indicated by reduced expression of SMC markers. Taken together, these results shed further light on the role of NF-κB in ESC/SMC differentiation. In summary, the results presented here show for the first time the involvement of NF-κB-miR-10a-HDAC4 in a regulatory signaling pathway (Fig. 4C) relevant in positively modulating SMC differentiation from ESCs. These findings not only provide new insights into the interplay between transcription factors and miRs during ESC/SMC differentiation but also have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2018588361,"The Notch signalling pathway has a crucial function in determining cell fates in multiple tissues within metazoan organisms. On binding to ligands, the Notch receptor is cleaved proteolytically and releases its intracellular domain (NotchICD). The NotchICD enters the nucleus and acts cooperatively with other factors to stimulate the transcription of target genes. High levels of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation require the formation of a ternary complex consisting of NotchICD, CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless, LAG-1) and a Mastermind family member. However, it is still not clear how the formation of the ternary complex is regulated. Here we show that Nemo-like kinase (NLK) negatively regulates Notch-dependent transcriptional activation by decreasing the formation of this ternary complex. Using a biochemical screen, we identified Notch as a new substrate of NLK. NLK-phosphorylated Notch1ICD is impaired in its ability to form a transcriptionally active ternary complex. Furthermore, knockdown of NLK leads to hyperactivation of Notch signalling and consequently decreases neurogenesis in zebrafish. Our results both define a new function for NLK and reveal a previously unidentified mode of regulation in the Notch signalling pathway."

Recently, TSP1 has been shown to regulate synaptogenesis in the developing brain. In this study, we examine another role of TSP1 in the CNS, namely, in proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We found that adult mice deficient in TSP1 exhibit reduced proliferation of NPCs in vivo [13,330±826 vs. 4914±455 (mean±SE wt vs. TSP1−/−); P<0.001, Student's t test] and impaired neuronal differentiation (1382±83 vs. 879±79; P<0.001). In vitro, NPC obtained from adult TSP1 −/− mice display decreased proliferation in BrdU assay (48±8 vs. 24±3.5%; P<0.01) and decreased neuronal fate commitment (8±0.85 vs. 4.6±0.5%; P<0.05) in contrast to wild-type NPCs. Both proliferation and neuronal differentiation deficits are remediable in vitro by exogenous TSP1. Notably, conditioned medium from TSP1−/− astrocytes, unlike that from control astrocytes, fails to promote neurogenesis in wild-type NPCs, suggesting that TSP1 is one of the key molecules responsible for astrocyte-induced neurogenesis. Our data demonstrate that TSP1 is a critical participant in maintenance of the adult NPC pool and in neuronal differentiation.—Lu, Z., Kipnis, J.

https://openalex.org/W2131473545,"Abrogation of p53 function occurs in almost all human cancers, with more than 50% of cancers harboring inactivating mutations in p53 itself. Mutation of p53 is indicative of highly aggressive cancers and poor prognosis. The vast majority of mutations in p53 occur in its core DNA binding domain (DBD) and result in inactivation of p53 by reducing its thermodynamic stability at physiological temperature. Here, we report a small molecule, SCH529074, that binds specifically to the p53 DBD in a saturable manner with an affinity of 1–2 μm. Binding restores wild type function to many oncogenic mutant forms of p53. This small molecule reactivates mutant p53 by acting as a chaperone, in a manner similar to that previously reported for the peptide CDB3. Binding of SCH529074 to the p53 DBD is specifically displaced by an oligonucleotide with a sequence derived from the p53-response element. In addition to reactivating mutant p53, SCH529074 binding inhibits ubiquitination of p53 by HDM2. We have also developed a novel variant of p53 by changing a single amino acid in the core domain of p53 (N268R), which abolishes binding of SCH529074. This amino acid change also inhibits HDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. Our novel findings indicate that through its interaction with p53 DBD, SCH529074 restores DNA binding activity to mutant p53 and inhibits HDM2-mediated ubiquitination.

https://openalex.org/W1990452435,"Various inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity can sensitize drug resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. However, the mechanisms underlying such effects of distinct HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) remain poorly understood. Here we show that both the HDACi trichostatin A and valproic acid induced a sensitization of multidrug-resistant cancer cells to the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide/VP16. This effect was associated with increased acetylation of certain lysines on histones H3 and H4, including lysine 16 on histone H4 (H4K16). Overexpression of the histone acetyltransferase hMOF, known to target H4K16, was sufficient to mimic HDACi treatment on sensitization and H4K16 acetylation, and importantly, small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of hMOF abolished the HDACi-mediated sensitizing effects as well as the increase in H4K16 acetylation. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the H4K16 deacetylase SIRT1 mimicked HDACi treatment whereas overexpression of SIRT1 abolished H4K16 acetylation and significantly reduced the sensitizing effects of HDACi. Interestingly, the effects of hMOF on H4K16 acetylation and sensitization to the topoisomerase II inhibitor could be directly counteracted by exogenous expression of increasing amounts of SIRT1 and vice versa. Our study results suggest that hMOF and SIRT1 activities are critical parameters in HDACi-mediated sensitization of multidrug-resistant cancer cells to topoisomerase II inhibitor and increased H4K16 acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2027482850,"Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a process wherein bulk cytosolic proteins and damaged organelles are sequestered and degraded via the lysosome. Alterations in autophagy-associated proteins have been shown to cause neural tube closure defects, neurodegeneration, and tumor formation. Normal lysosome function is critical for autophagy completion and when altered may lead to an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) and caspase activation. The tumor suppressor p53 is highly expressed in neural precursor cells (NPCs) and has an important role in the regulation of both autophagy and apoptosis. We hypothesized that altered lysosome function would lead to NPC death via an interaction between autophagy- and apoptosis-associated proteins. To test our hypothesis, we utilized FGF2-expanded NPCs and the neural stem cell line, C17.2, in combination with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine (CQ) and the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1). Both CQ and Baf A1 caused concentration- and time-dependent AV accumulation, p53 phosphorylation, increased damage regulator autophagy modulator levels, caspase-3 activation, and cell death. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of Atg7, but not Beclin1, expression significantly inhibited CQ- and Baf A1-induced cell death, indicating that Atg7 is an upstream mediator of lysosome dysfunction-induced cell death. Cell death and/or caspase-3 activation was also attenuated by protein synthesis inhibition, p53 deficiency, or Bax deficiency, indicating involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic death pathway. In contrast to lysosome dysfunction, starvation-induced AV accumulation was inhibited by either Atg7 or Beclin1 knockdown, and Atg7 knockdown had no effect on starvation-induced death. These findings indicate that Atg7- and Beclin1-induced autophagy plays a cytoprotective role during starvation but that Atg7 has a unique pro-apoptotic function in response to lysosome dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1995262004,"G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are an important family of Ser/Thr kinases that specifically phosphorylate and desensitize the activated receptor in response to environmental stimulation. Here we identify p53, a key tumor suppressor, as a novel GRK substrate in vivo, revealing a previously unknown function of GRKs in regulation of genome stability. Knockdown GRK5 in osteosarcoma cells inhibits DNA damage-induced apoptosis via a p53-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, GRK5, but not GRK2 or GRK6, phosphorylates p53 at Thr-55, which promotes the degradation of p53, leading to inhibition of p53-dependent apoptotic response to genotoxic damage. Consistently, the increase of p53 and irradiation-induced apoptosis were observed in GRK5-deficient mice. These results demonstrate GRK5 as a novel kinase of p53, as well as a negative regulator of p53-mediated signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1985671292,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor expression is often elevated in ovarian cancer, but its potential role in ovarian cancer metastasis has just begun to be revealed. Cadherin switching is a crucial step during tumorigenesis, particularly in metastasis. Here, we showed that GnRH is an inducer of E- to P-cadherin switching, which is reminiscent of that seen during ovarian tumor progression. Overexpression of P-cadherin significantly enhanced, whereas knockdown of P-cadherin reduced migration and invasion regardless of E-cadherin expression, suggesting that inappropriate expression of P-cadherin contributes to the invasive phenotype. These effects of P-cadherin were mediated by activation of the Rho GTPases, Rac1, and Cdc42, through accumulation of p120 catenin (p120ctn) in the cytoplasm. The use of p120ctn small interfering RNA or chimeric cadherin construct to inhibit p120ctn expression and cytoplasmic localization, respectively, resulted in significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion, with a concomitant reduction in Rac1 and Cdc42 activation, confirming that the effect was p120ctn specific. Similarly, the migratory/invasive phenotype could be reversed by expression of dominant-negative Rac1 and Cdc42. These results identify for the first time cadherin switching and p120ctn signaling as important targets of GnRH function and as novel mediators of invasiveness and tumor progression in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1977918009,"Cutaneous malignant melanoma is considered one of the most deadly human cancers, based on both its penchant for metastatic spread and its typical resistance to currently available therapy. Long known to harbor oncogenic NRAS mutations, melanomas were more recently reported to be frequent bearers of activating mutations in BRAF, one of the effectors situated downstream of wild-type NRAS. NRAS and BRAF mutations are rarely found in the same melanoma, suggesting that they may possess important overlapping oncogenic activities. Here, we compare and contrast the oncogenic roles of the three major NRas downstream effectors, Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ral guanine exchange factor (RalGEF), using genetically engineered Arf-deficient immortalized mouse melanocytes as a model system. Although no single downstream pathway could recapitulate all of the consequences of oncogenic NRas expression, our data indicate a prominent role for BRaf and PI3K in melanocyte senescence and invasiveness, respectively. More surprisingly, we discovered that constitutive RalGEF activation had a major impact on several malignant phenotypes, particularly anchorage-independent growth, indicating that this often overlooked pathway should be more carefully evaluated as a possible therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2089120909,"Myogenesis is a process whereby myoblasts differentiate and fuse into multinucleated myotubes, the precursors of myofibers. Various signals and factors modulate this process, and glucocorticoids (GCs) are important regulators of skeletal muscle metabolism. We show that glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a GC-induced gene, and the newly identified isoform long GILZ (L-GILZ) are expressed in skeletal muscle tissue and in C2C12 myoblasts where GILZ/L-GILZ maximum expression occurs during the first few days in differentiation medium. Moreover, we observed that GC treatment of myoblasts, which increased GILZ/L-GILZ expression, resulted in reduced myotube formation, whereas GILZ and L-GILZ silencing dampened GC effects. Inhibition of differentiation caused by GILZ/L-GILZ overexpression correlated with inhibition of MyoD function and reduced expression of myogenin. Notably, results indicate that GILZ and L-GILZ bind and regulate MyoD/HDAC1 transcriptional activity, thus mediating the anti-myogenic effect of GCs."
https://openalex.org/W2058541075,"Excessive liver production of ketone bodies is one of many metabolic complications that can arise from diabetes, and in severe untreated cases, it can result in ketoacidosis, coma, and death. Mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2), the rate-limiting enzyme in ketogenesis, has been shown to interact with PPARα and act as a coactivator to up-regulate transcription from the PPRE of its own gene. Although protein palmitoylation is typically a cytosolic process that promotes membrane association, we recently identified 21 palmitoylated proteins in rat liver mitochondria, including HMGCS2. Herein, our data support a mechanism whereby palmitate is first added onto HMGCS2 active site Cys166 and then transacylated to Cys305. Palmitoylation promotes the HMGCS2/PPARα interaction, resulting in transcriptional activation from the Hmgcs2 PPRE. These results, together with the fact that 8 of the 21 palmitoylated mitochondrial proteins that we previously identified have nuclear receptor interacting motifs, demonstrate a novel—and perhaps ubiquitous—role for palmitoylation as a modulator of transcription.—Kostiuk, M.

PCR was performed with 1 μl of cDNA with forward and reverse primers specific for GAPDH (5′-TGCATCCTGCACCACCAACT-3′ and 5′-TGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC-3′, hygromycin phosphotransferase (5′-CATGGCGTGATTTCATATGCGCGA-3′ and 5′-TCCAGAAGAAGATGTTGGCGACCT-3′), puromycin acetyltransferase (5′-ACCGAGCTGCAAGAACTCTTCCTC-3′ and 5′-AGGAGGCCTTCCATCTGTTGCT-3′), Pdpn (5′-ACCAACACAGACGACCAAGACACT-3′ and 5′-AAGCATCCACTGTGCCTTCAGTTC-3′), Fhl1 (5′-GAGAAGTTCGACTGTCACTACTGC-3′ and 5′-CTGATCCTGGTAAGTGATTCCTCC-3′), 4930408O21Rik (5′-TGTTCTCAGAGCCCAGCATCACTT-3′ and 5′-ACATCCTCTCAGCTGGTTCCTTCA-3′), 1700012B09Rik (5′-CTGTGAACCGCATAAGAGAATCAAGGAGG-3′ and 5′-TGCCTCGAGTAGTACTTGGCTTGT-3′), Tmem163 (5′-ATAGAGTCTGTCATCATGGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-ACAGGCTTCCTGTCAAGCAGAGA-3′), Loc677224 (5′-AACATCCCAGAGCCTTTGACTCCT-3′ and 5′-CAAAGCTGCCATAGCTCTATTCGG-3′), 1810008K04Rik (5′-AAGCCAGGACTCTCACATGCAACT-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTGCAGATGGAACGGAACAC-3′), and D4bwg0951e (5′-TGGATGGCATCTCAGTAGGGAGCTA-3′ and 5′-TTGCACACCAGTCCCATGCAAA-3′). GAPDH was amplified at 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. Hygromycin phosphotransferase was amplified at 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The other genes were amplified at 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. qPCR was performed with 0.5 μl of cDNA amplified 95 °C for 10 min followed by 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles in a StepOne RT-PCR machine with SYBR Green master mix and analyzed with StepOne Software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Western blotting was performed as described previously (12.Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein (10 μg/lane) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore IH1079562), and incubated with antisera specific for Pdpn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC53553), Cas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC860), active Src kinase (Cell Signaling Technology 2010), v-Src (Upstate Biotechnology 05-185), Tmem163 (raised against the sequence VQSDEERQPRISESGQFS, representing amino acids 43–60 of mouse Tmem163, in rabbits as described previously) (12.Shen Y.

Primary antiserum was recognized by appropriate secondary antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Millipore WBKLS0500). After blotting, membranes were stained with India ink to verify equal loading and transfer. Cells (300,000/dish) were cultured on 35-mm poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek P35GC-1.5-14-C) for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline followed by 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, incubated with Pdpn antiserum (1:100) overnight at 4 °C, washed, and then labeled with goat anti-Syrian hamster IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes A21110). Cells were visualized on Zeiss Axiovert or PASCAL microscope systems as described (14.Li X. Jia Z. Shen Y. Ichikawa H. Jarvik J. Nagele R.G. Goldberg G.S.

Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14.Li X. Jia Z. Shen Y. Ichikawa H. Jarvik J. Nagele R.G. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, anchored and nonanchored growth was measured by plating 20,000 cells/well on standard 12-well cluster plates (Falcon 353043) or ultralow attachment 24-well cluster plates (Corning 3473), respectively, and counting cells at defined times by Coulter counter. To examine membrane cell migration, 200,000 cells were plated on cell culture inserts with a 8-μm pore size (Transwell-Clear; Costar 3428) in 6-well cluster plates and grown for 24 h. Cells were then released separately from the top of the membrane, bottom of the membrane, and well beneath the membrane and counted. Migration and colonization was quantitated as the percentage of cells that moved to the bottom of the membrane or well beneath the membrane, respectively. Cell migration was also examined by a wound-healing assay and quantitated as the number of cells that entered a 1.8-mm2 or 0.9-mm2 area of the wound during 24 h. Cells were stained with 0.2% trypan blue and counted with a hemocytometer to evaluate cytotoxicity. Tumor cells must overcome contact normalization by adjacent nontransformed cells in their microenvironment to become malignant or metastatic (17.Rubin H. Adv. Cancer Res. 2007; 98: 117-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have developed a layered culture system to identify genes involved in this process (12.Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13.Alexander D.B. Ichikawa H. Bechberger J.F. Valiunas V. Ohki M. Naus C.C. Kunimoto T. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Src-transformed cells were incubated on a porous membrane directly over nontransformed cells (see FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). The transformed cells and nontransformed cells were able to form intercellular junctions through the pores in the membrane while being retained as separate populations. Thus, although intercellular junctions formed between the transformed and nontransformed cells, the layers were retained as distinct populations that were harvested separately. As controls, transformed cells were also incubated alone, or 1 mm over nontransformed cells to enable communication by diffusible factors but not direct contact. As we have reported previously, cellular material is not transferred between harvested cell layers (12.Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S.

This was verified by the retention of the Src kinase and mRNA encoding puromycin acetyltransferase in the transformed cells and mRNA encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase in nontransformed cells (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2RT-PCR analysis of the effects of Src and contact normalization on the expression of several genes. Src-transformed cells were cultured on porous membranes directly above nontransformed cells (contact normalized), directly above another layer of transformed cells (Src controls), or 1 mm above nontransformed cells (diffusible factors).

About 45,000 probe sets were examined, representing >39,000 transcripts. The expression of genes represented by 10928 probe sets, or up to about 25% of the transcriptome, was affected 2-fold or more by transforming Src kinase activity. The expression of genes represented by up to 5560 probe sets was higher in Src-transformed cells than nontransformed cells, whereas the expression of genes represented by up to 5368 probe sets was lower. However, the expression of only 39 genes was found to be significantly affected during contact normalization of Src-transformed cells (see Table 1). The mRNA levels of several of these genes, including Pdpn, Tmem163, Fhl1, and 5 expressed sequence tags were verified by RT-PCR as shown in Fig. 2.TABLE 1Genes affected by contact normalization of Src transformed cellsSymbolProbe setsFold changeGene nameSrcaExpression in Src-transformed cells divided by expression in nontransformed cells.CNbExpression in transformed cells divided by expression in transformed cells undergoing contact normalization.Genes increased by Src and decreased during contact normalization1700012B09RikcEffects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).1428984_a_at115−3.4RIKEN cDNA 1700012B09 genePdpncEffects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).1419309_at93−4.7PodoplaninTmem163cEffects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).1428077_at58−5.5Transmembrane protein 163Smoc21415935_at47−6.6SPARC-related modular calcium binding 2Pstpip21421410_a_at41−4.5Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 2Mal1417275_at30−5.6Myelin and lymphocyte proteinLepr1425644_at28−4.7Leptin receptorElavl21421883_at26−9.9Embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like 2Igsf111460607_at26−5.0Immunoglobulin superfamily, member 11Mafb1451715_at14−6.7v-Maf protein BLOC677224cEffects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).1435703_at13−3.5Similar to RIKEN cDNA 2810457I064930408O21RikcEffects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).1431741_a_at8.8−4.8RIKEN cDNA 4930408O21 geneElmod11457223_at8.3−5.0ELMO domain-containing 1Atp13a41438707_at7.8−4.7ATPase type 13A4Kdr1449379_at6.6−3.7Kinase insert domain protein receptorC91422815_at5.4−4.9Complement component 9Genes decreased by Src and increased during contact normalizationFgf71438405_at−13046Fibroblast growth factor 7D10Bwg1379e1435050_at−9513DNA segment Chr 10 Brigham and Women's Genetics 1379 expressedSox111431225_at−9316SRY box-containing gene 11Ccl201422029_at−9112Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20Vcam1dGenes previously shown to be induced by contact normalization.1448162_at−7822Vascular cell adhesion molecule 11415989_at−56161451314_a_at−5512Sema3e1427673_a_at−718.3Semaphorin 3ESdprdGenes previously shown to be induced by contact normalization.1416779_at−4713Serum deprivation response1416778_at−3911Epha41429021_at−448.3Eph receptor A4Ntn11454974_at−4217Netrin 1Cabc11417066_at−325.0Chaperone, ABC1 activity of bc1 complex like (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)Spry11415874_at−264.5Sprouty homolog 1 (Drosophila)Loxl11451978_at−259.9Lysyl oxidase-like 11810008K04RikcEffects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).1441254_at−199.0RIKEN cDNA 1810008K04 genePdgfrb1436970_a_at−183.9Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β polypeptideD4Bwg0951ecEffects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).1428384_at−174.2DNA segment Chr 4 Brigham and Women's Genetics 0951 expressedFhl1cEffects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).,dGenes previously shown to be induced by contact normalization.1417872_at−1611Four and a half LIM domains 1Gpr1261437408_at−165.7G protein-coupled receptor 1261437409_s_at−135.7Egfr1435888_at−165.2Epidermal growth factor receptorItih21417618_at−127.3Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 2Epb4.1l31419062_at−125.6Erythrocyte protein band 4.1-like 3Il1rl11425145_at−9.78.3Interleukin 1 receptor-like 1Wnt5a1448818_at−9.14.6Wingless-related MMTV integration site 5ATmem561434553_at−8.24.4Transmembrane protein 56a Expression in Src-transformed cells divided by expression in nontransformed cells.b Expression in transformed cells divided by expression in transformed cells undergoing contact normalization.c Effects confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 1).d Genes previously shown to be induced by contact normalization. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table 1, the expression of 23 genes was suppressed by Src and increased by contact normalization. Some of these genes encode proteins that mediate events including growth factor signaling (Fgf7, Epha4, Spry1, Pdgfrb, Gpr126, Egfr, Wnt5a, and Il1rl1) and transcription (Sox11 and Fhl1). Many of these genes have been implicated in the regulation of tumor cell growth and migration. For example, recent experiments indicate that Epb4.1l3 (erythrocyte protein band 4.1-like 3) (19.Cavanna T. Pokorná E. Veselý P. Gray C. Zicha D. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Itih2 (inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain) (20.Werbowetski-Ogilvie T.E. Agar N.Y. Waldkircher de Oliveira R.M. Faury D. Antel J.P. Jabado N. Del Maestro R.F. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) can suppress tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Induction of three of these genes, Vcam1, Sdpr, and Fhl1, has been previously associated with contact normalization (13.Alexander D.B. Ichikawa H. Bechberger J.F. Valiunas V. Ohki M. Naus C.C. Kunimoto T. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these genes are candidate biomarkers that are suppressed in malignant tumor cells (14.Li X. Jia Z. Shen Y. Ichikawa H. Jarvik J. Nagele R.G. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For example, Src utilizes Cas to suppress Fhl1 expression to promote tumor cell migration (12.Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The expression of 16 genes was increased by Src and suppressed by contact normalization. These genes are of great interest because they may be required for malignant growth and metastasis. These genes encode proteins that mediate events including cation (Smoc2, Atp13a4) and glutamate (Tmem163) transport, neuronal development (Mal), energy homeostasis (Lepr), mRNA transcription (Mafb) and stabilization (Elavl2), cell adhesion (Igsf11), growth factor signaling (Kdr), immunological activity (C9), and cell migration (Pdpn). Some of these gene products may act as biomarkers and targets for chemotherapy. For example, inhibitors have been generated to target kinase insert domain receptor (Kdr) to prevent VEGF signaling and suppress angiogenesis required for malignant tumor growth (21.Schenone S. Bondavalli F. Botta M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2007; 14: 2495-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Immunological reagents have also been targeted to immunoglobulin superfamily 11 (IGSF11) (22.Watanabe T. Suda T. Tsunoda T. Uchida N. Ura K. Kato T. Hasegawa S. Satoh S. Ohgi S. Tahara H. Furukawa Y. Nakamura Y. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Pdpn (23.Kato Y. Kaneko M.K. Kunita A. Ito H. Kameyama A. Ogasawara S. Matsuura N. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Ozaki Y. Narimatsu H. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 54-61PubMed Google Scholar) to prevent tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We have found previously that Src suppresses Fhl1 expression to promote tumor cell migration and that this effect is reversed during contact normalization (12.Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14.Li X. Jia Z. Shen Y. Ichikawa H. Jarvik J. Nagele R.G. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, our data are consistent with these previous reports. Fhl1 mRNA expression was decreased by >10-fold in Src-transformed cells compared with nontransformed cells. In addition, contact normalization increased Fhl1 mRNA levels to those seen in nontransformed cells. Moreover, direct contact with other Src-transformed cells or diffusible factors from nontransformed cells did not significantly affect Fhl1 mRNA expression in transformed cells (see Fig. 3). In contrast to Fhl1, Src increased the expression of Pdpn, which is a membrane-bound extracellular glycoprotein that associates with endogenous ligands to promote cell motility leading to tumor cell invasion and metastasis (8.Scholl F.G. Gamallo C. Vilaró S. Quintanilla M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4601-4613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Wicki A. Christofori G. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10.Martín-Villar E. Megias D. Castel S. Yurrita M.M. Vilaró S. Quintanilla M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4541-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, Src increased Pdpn mRNA expression by nearly 10-fold. In addition, contact normalization decreased Pdpn mRNA expression in transformed cells by about 80%. As with Fhl1, contact with other Src-transformed cells, or diffusible factors from nontransformed cells, did not significantly affect Pdpn expression in transformed cells (see Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4, the effects of Src transformation and contact normalization on Fhl1 and Pdpn mRNA expression were confirmed by qRT-PCR, as well as standard RT-PCR shown in Fig. 3. As predicted by mRNA analysis, transforming Src kinase activity increased Pdpn protein expression. Because the gap junction protein Cx43 can affect transformed cell migration (24.Xu X. Francis R. Wei C.J. Linask K.L. Lo C.W. Development. 2006; 133: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25.Shao Q. Wang H. McLachlan E. Veitch G.I. Laird D.W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2705-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the effects of Src on Pdpn expression were analyzed in Cx43Ko and wild type cells. Western blotting, shown in Fig. 5a, revealed that Src augmented Pdpn protein expression in both cell types. These findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy as shown in Fig. 5b. The effects of Src on Pdpn expression are intriguing because Pdpn can promote tumor cell migration leading to malignant and metastatic growth (9.Wicki A. Christofori G. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23.Kato Y. Kaneko M.K. Kunita A. Ito H. Kameyama A. Ogasawara S. Matsuura N. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Ozaki Y. Narimatsu H. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 54-61PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Nakazawa Y. Sato S. Naito M. Kato Y. Mishima K. Arai H. Tsuruo T. Fujita N. Blood. 2008; 112: 1730-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have found previously that Src utilizes Cas to suppress Fhl1 expression to promote nonanchored cell growth and migration of transformed cells (12.Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of Src on Pdpn expression were examined in cells with and without Cas. As shown in Fig. 5a, more Pdpn was found in Src-transformed CasKo cells transfected with Cas than control transfectants. These data indicate that Src utilizes Cas to augment Pdpn expression and promote tumor cell migration. The effects of Pdpn on cell motility were also examined by transfection with cDNA. Western blot analysis, shown in Fig. 6a, demonstrates that nontransformed cells transfected with cDNA encoding Pdpn expressed Pdpn protein levels comparable with Src-transformed cells. Immunofluorescent microscopy, shown in Fig. 6b, found Pdpn localized to the plasma membrane where it may act as a signaling receptor (9.Wicki A. Christofori G. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23.Kato Y. Kaneko M.K. Kunita A. Ito H. Kameyama A. Ogasawara S. Matsuura N. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Ozaki Y.

Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Pdpn expression did not significantly affect the growth or anchorage dependence of nontransformed cells (Fig. 6c). However, as shown in Fig. 6d, Pdpn expression did augment the ability of nontransformed cells to migrate by >5-fold, achieving levels comparable with Src-transformed cells. Thus, Pdpn did not require transforming Src activity to promote cell migration. Nonetheless, because Pdpn did not augment nonanchored growth (Fig. 6c), it was not sufficient to increase colonization of nontransformed cells, as assayed by the ability of cells to migrate through porous membranes and dissociate from the membranes to attach and grow on the well 1 mm under the membranes as shown in Fig. 6d. The effects of Pdpn on the motility of Src-transformed cells were examined by transfection with siRNA. As shown in Fig. 7a, Pdpn protein expression was decreased in Src-transfected cells transfected with siRNA directed against Pdpn. Wound-healing assays, shown in Fig. 7b and supplemental Fig. 1, indicate that this decrease in Pdpn expression reduced the migration of Src-transformed cells by >60%. These data indicate that Src induces Pdpn expression to promote cell migration. However, incomplete suppression of transformed cell migration by Pdpn siRNA also suggests that factors other than Pdpn can increase cell motility. Nontransformed cells can force tumor cells to assume a normal morphology and phenotype by the process of contact normalization (1.Rubin H. Bioessays. 2006; 28: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2.Rubin H. Adv. Cancer Res. 2008; 100: 159-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28.Glick A.B. Yuspa S.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Contact normalization is a powerful process. For example, transformed keratinocytes that comprise up to 4% of epidermal volume can be controlled in human skin for decades (29.Jonason A.S. Kunala S. Price G.J. Restifo R.J. Spinelli H.M. Persing J.A. Leffell D.J. Tarone R.E. Brash D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14025-14029Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). We sought to identify genes expressed by transformed cells that are not controlled by contact normalization to elucidate novel mechanisms that lead to tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Src-transformed cells were used to create a model system for these assays. Src is a clinically relevant oncogenic kinase that phosphorylates Cas to promote tumor cell migration (4.Honda H. Oda H.

We have previously utilized Affymetrix U74 expression arrays to analyze the effects of contact normalization on the expression of about 14,000 genes (13.Alexander D.B. Ichikawa H. Bechberger J.F. Valiunas V. Ohki M. Naus C.C. Kunimoto T. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present assays, we utilized more advanced (Affymetrix 431) expression arrays to achieve a more reliable and comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome. Although approximately 25% of ∼39,000 transcripts examined by these arrays were affected by transforming Src kinase activity, only 39 of these, representing approximately 0.01% of the transcriptome, were affected by contact normalization. In addition to confirming our previous findings that Src inhibits the expression of the potential tumor suppressors Fhl1, Sdpr, and Vcam1, which are induced by contact normalization (13.Alexander D.B. Ichikawa H. Bechberger J.F. Valiunas V. Ohki M. Naus C.C. Kunimoto T. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the present data have identified additional candidate tumor suppressors, as well as potential tumor promoters. Most notably, we found that Src utilized Cas to induce Pdpn expression and that Pdpn expression was suppressed during contact normalization of Src-transformed cells. These data are consistent with reports of Fos, a component of the AP1 transcription factor acting downstream of tumor promoters, including TPA and Src, inducing Pdpn during skin carcinogenesis (32.Durchdewald M.

Pdpn is a well characterized biomarker that can promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis (8.Scholl F.G. Gamallo C. Vilaró S. Quintanilla M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4601-4613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Wicki A. Christofori G. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10.Martín-Villar E. Megias D. Castel S. Yurrita M.M. Vilaró S. Quintanilla M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4541-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Indeed, our data indicate that Pdpn signaling is both necessary and sufficient to promote tumor cell migration. Pdpn is found at the invasive front of many types of tumors, which is consistent with its role in promoting malignant invasion (9.Wicki A. Christofori G. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27.Wicki A. Lehembre F. Wick N. Hantusch B. Kerjaschki D. Christofori G. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Compounds that prevent interaction between Pdpn and its natural ligand(s) can effectively inhibit tumor cell migration (9.Wicki A. Christofori G. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 33.Kunita A. Kashima T.G. Morishita Y. Fukayama M. Kato Y. Tsuruo T. Fujita N. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Clec-2 has been reported to associate with Pdpn and increase tumor cell migration, and antiserum that blocks binding of Clec-2 to Pdpn can suppress tumor cell metastasis (23.Kato Y. Kaneko M.K. Kunita A. Ito H. Kameyama A. Ogasawara S. Matsuura N. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Ozaki Y. Narimatsu H. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 54-61PubMed Google Scholar). However, microarray analysis indicated that the cells used in our study did not express Clec-2 (data not shown), which is normally expressed by platelets (23.Kato Y. Kaneko M.K. Kunita A. Ito H. Kameyama A. Ogasawara S. Matsuura N. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Inoue O. Ozaki Y. Narimatsu H. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 54-61PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our data indicate that Pdpn acts downstream of Src and Cas to promote cell migration. This study presents an example of how genes that are induced by Src and suppressed by contact normalization can be utilized as biomarkers and promising targets for chemotherapy. For example, we have previously reported that Src utilizes Cas to suppress Fhl1 expression, which can be induced by contact normalization and suppress tumor cell migration (12.Shen Y. Jia Z. Nagele R.G. Ichikawa H. Goldberg G.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13.Alexander D.B. Ichikawa H. Bechberger J.F. Valiunas V. Ohki M. Naus C.C.

Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other side of the coin, our data indicate that Src induces the expression of genes that are suppressed by contact normalization and promote tumor cell migration. In addition to Pdpn, these genes, exemplified by Kdr and Igsf11, may serve as biomarkers and chemotherapeutic targets. Kdr, which is also called Vefgr2, is a receptor for Vegfa (34.Olsson A.K. Dimberg A. Kreuger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar), and can be targeted to prevent VEGF signaling and suppress angiogenesis required for malignant tumor growth (21.Schenone S. Bondavalli F. Botta M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2007; 14: 2495-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Antisera directed against IGSF11 can also be used to prevent tumor cell invasion and metastasis (22.Watanabe T. Suda T. Tsunoda T. Uchida N. Ura K. Kato T. Hasegawa S. Satoh S. Ohgi S. Tahara H. Furukawa Y. Nakamura Y. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition to known genes, this strategy has also identified genes involved in contact normalization that have not yet been annotated (see Table 1), and, like Pdpn and Kdr, may also encode transmembrane proteins that can be targeted by chemotherapeutic reagents. For example, Tmem163 expression was elevated in Src-transformed cells, but decreased by contact normalization. Interestingly, elevated Tmem163 mRNA expression has also been found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (Gene Expression Omnibus data set GDS1732/1552626) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (35.Brune V. Tiacci E. Pfeil I. Döring C. Eckerle S. van Noesel C.J. Klapper W. Falini B. von Heydebreck A. Metzler D. Bräuninger A. Hansmann M.L. Küppers R. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2251-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Tmem163 is predicted to form an integral membrane protein with six transmembrane helices. In addition to mRNA analysis shown in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, Western blotting experiments indicate that Tmem163 protein expression was elevated in transformed cells and nontransformed cells transfected with Tmem163 cDNA. Moreover, Tmem163 transfectants grew nearly twice as fast and migrated several times the rate of control transfectants (see supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, the study of genes affected by Src and contact normalization should help elucidate mechanisms that underlie tumor cell growth and migration.

https://openalex.org/W2005804545,"The soluble form of the chemokine fractalkine/CX(3)CL1 regulates microglia activation in the central nervous system (CNS), ultimately affecting neuronal survival. This study aims to determine whether CXCL12, another chemokine constitutively expressed in the CNS (known as stromal cell-derived factor 1; SDF-1), regulates cleavage of fractalkine from neurons. To this end, ELISA was used to measure protein levels of soluble fractalkine in the medium of rat neuronal cultures exposed to SDF-1. Gene arrays, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot were used to measure overall fractalkine expression in neurons. The data show that the rate of fractalkine shedding in healthy cultures positively correlates with in vitro differentiation and survival. In analogy to non-neuronal cells, metalloproteinases (ADAM10/17) are involved in cleavage of neuronal fractalkine as indicated by studies with pharmacologic inhibitors. Moreover, treatment of the neuronal cultures with SDF-1 stimulates expression of the inducible metalloproteinase ADAM17 and increases soluble fractalkine content in culture medium. The effect of SDF-1 is blocked by an inhibitor of both ADAM10 and -17, but only partially affected by a more specific inhibitor of ADAM10. In addition, SDF-1 also up-regulates expression of the fractalkine gene. Conversely, exposure of neurons to an excitotoxic stimulus (i.e. NMDA) inhibits alpha-secretase activity and markedly diminishes soluble fractalkine levels, leading to cell death. These results, along with previous findings on the neuroprotective role of both SDF-1 and fractalkine, suggest that this novel interaction between the two chemokines may contribute to in vivo regulation of neuronal survival by modulating microglial neurotoxic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1974557118,"Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a key evolutionarily conserved process whereby decreases in endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content lead to the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. How this process is regulated in specific tumor cell types is poorly understood. In an effort to address this concern, we obtained and tested primary Wilms tumor cells, finding no detectable SOCE in this cell type. Analysis of the expression levels of STIM1 and ORAI1 (the molecular mediators of SOC) revealed poor STIM1 expression. Analysis of the STIM1 promoter using the TESS search system (University of Pennsylvania) revealed four putative response elements to the zinc-finger proteins WT1 (Wilms tumor suppressor 1) and EGR1 (early growth response 1). Either overexpression of WT1 or knockdown of EGR1 resulted in loss of STIM1 expression and a resultant decrease in SOCE. Furthermore, examination of Egr1 knock-out animals revealed loss of STIM1 expression in multiple tissues. Finally, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we reveal direct binding of both WT1 and EGR1 to putative response elements located within 500 bp of the transcriptional start site of STIM1.

IntroductionChanges in cytosolic Ca2+ levels are a common component of the signal transduction pathways for numerous growth factors and cytokines. Thus, activation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors (primarily via either G protein or tyrosine kinase receptors) results in the generation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar).

Given the impact of these pathways on cancer cell biology, it is not surprising that altered Ca2+ signaling can be observed in numerous classes of cancer cells. Indeed, inhibition of either the phosphatidylinositol pathway (9.Powis G. Gallegos A. Abraham R.T. Ashendel C.L. Zalkow L.H. Grindey G.B. Bonjouklian R. Cancer Chemother.

Despite these observations, Ca2+ signals remain poorly utilized therapeutic targets. This is in part because these studies were all performed prior to the discovery of the identities of the molecular mediators of SOCE. Without this insight, it was not possible to link changes in Ca2+ signals with changes in the expression and function of oncogenes and tumor suppressors that cause tumor formation.After nearly 20 years of investigations into the mysteries of SOCE, the identities of the key molecular components of this process have finally been revealed (for recent reviews, see Refs. 12.Deng X.

Thus, the type 1A transmembrane protein STIM1 serves a dual role as an ER Ca2+ sensor and activator of SOCE (14.Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr.

Both of these proteins have mammalian homologues (STIM2, ORAI2, and ORAI3) that do not appear to be required for SOCE (4.Potier M. Gonzalez J.C. Motiani R.K. Abdullaev I.F. Bisaillon J.M. Singer H.A.

Despite an exciting recent report that SOCE is a critical and required component of breast tumor cell migration and metastasis (3.Yang S. Zhang J.J. Huang X.Y. Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 124-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), there remains no published insight into the regulation of SOCE components at the level of transcription or their relationship to tumorigenesis.In early investigations performed prior to the discovery of its role in Ca2+ signaling, STIM1 was described as a tumor suppressor because it causes growth arrest in human G401 rhabdoid tumor cells (21.Sabbioni S. Barbanti-Brodano G. Croce C.M. Negrini M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Sabbioni S. Veronese A. Trubia M. Taramelli R. Barbanti-Brodano G. Croce C.M. Negrini M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 86: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a kidney-derived rhabdoid cell line often used to study chromosomal changes in Wilms tumor (23.Garvin A.J. Re G.G. Tarnowski B.I. Hazen-Martin D.J. Sens D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 375-380PubMed Google Scholar) due to the fact that they lack expression of WT1 (Wilms tumor suppressor 1). WT1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple growth factors such as colony-stimulating factor (24.Harrington M.A. Konicek B. Song A. Xia X.L. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21271-21275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factor I (25.Sarfstein R. Werner H. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21999-22002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, loss of WT1 leads to up-regulation of these growth factors and the formation of Wilms tumor, leading to its original classification as a tumor suppressor (27.Little M. Wells C. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies have revealed a potential role for WT1 as an oncogene because it is up-regulated in a variety of human cancers such as astrocytic tumors (28.Oji Y. Suzuki T. Nakano Y.

WT1 is a member of the EGR (early growth response) family, primarily due to similarities in the consensus sequences of WT1 and EGR1. However, the consequences of binding are most often mutually opposing; EGR1 activates the transcription of genes that WT1 represses (33.Sukhatme V.P. Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.H.

Like WT1, EGR1 expression levels are atypical in multiple neoplastic cell types such as prostate cancer (35.Baron V. De Gregorio G. Krones-Herzig A. Virolle T. Calogero A. Urcis R. Mercola D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), glioblastoma (36.Ahn B.H. Park M.H. Lee Y.H. Min do S.

Furthermore, EGR1 can also act as either an oncogene (35.Baron V. De Gregorio G. Krones-Herzig A. Virolle T. Calogero A. Urcis R. Mercola D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or a tumor suppressor (37.Krones-Herzig A. Mittal S. Yule K. Liang H. English C. Urcis R. Soni T. Adamson E.D. Mercola D. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5133-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) in different cell types. In this work, we reveal that STIM1 expression is directly regulated by EGR1 and WT1, with EGR1 driving STIM1 expression and WT1 antagonizing this effect. Given the well described impact of these oncogenes/tumor suppressors on tumorigenesis, these findings provide important new insight into differential Ca2+ signaling in cancer cells.

WT1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple growth factors such as colony-stimulating factor (24.Harrington M.A. Konicek B. Song A. Xia X.L. Fredericks W.J.

WT1 is a member of the EGR (early growth response) family, primarily due to similarities in the consensus sequences of WT1 and EGR1.

In this work, we reveal that STIM1 expression is directly regulated by EGR1 and WT1, with EGR1 driving STIM1 expression and WT1 antagonizing this effect. Given the well described impact of these oncogenes/tumor suppressors on tumorigenesis, these findings provide important new insight into differential Ca2+ signaling in cancer cells. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels are a common component of the signal transduction pathways for numerous growth factors and cytokines. Thus, activation of phospholipase C-coupled receptors (primarily via either G protein or tyrosine kinase receptors) results in the generation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffuses rapidly through the cytosol and interacts with its receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumREresponse elementSOCEstore-operated Ca2+ entryChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. resulting in both transient ER Ca2+ release and a lengthy increased influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane, a process termed capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) (2.Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B.

Although the high affinity Ca(2+) channel, Cch1, and its subunit Mid1, have been suggested as the protein complex responsible for mediating Ca(2+) influx, a direct demonstration of the gating mechanism of the Cch1 channel remains elusive. In this first mechanistic study of Cch1 channel activity we show that the Cch1 channel from the model human fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, is directly activated by the depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that agents that enable ER Ca(2+) store depletion promote the development of whole cell inward Ca(2+) currents through Cch1 that are effectively blocked by La(3+) and dependent on the presence of Mid1. Cch1 is permeable to both Ca(2+) and Ba(2+); however, unexpectedly, in contrast to Ca(2+) currents, Ba(2+) currents are steeply voltage-dependent. Cch1 maintains a strong Ca(2+) selectivity even in the presence of high concentrations of monovalent ions. Single channel analysis indicated that Cch1 channel conductance is small, similar to that reported for the Ca(2+) current I(CRAC). This study demonstrates that Cch1 functions as a store-operated Ca(2+)-selective channel that is gated by intracellular Ca(2+) depletion. The inability of cryptococcal cells that lacked the Cch1-Mid1 channel to survive ER stress suggests that Cch1 and its co-regulator, Mid1, are critical players in the restoration of Ca(2+) homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2091834996,"T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus express decreased levels of the T cell receptor-associated CD3 ζ chain, a feature directly linked to their aberrant function. The decrease in CD3ζ protein expression is in part due to decreased levels of functional wild type isoform of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of CD3ζ mRNA with concomitant increased levels of an unstable alternatively spliced isoform. In order to identify factors involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of CD3ζ, we performed mass spectrometric analysis of Jurkat T cell nuclear proteins “pulled down” by a CD3ζ 3′-UTR oligonucleotide, which identified the splicing protein alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2). We show for the first time that ASF/SF2 binds specifically to the 3′-UTR of CD3ζ and regulates expression of CD3ζ protein by limiting the production of the alternatively spliced isoform. During activation of human T cells, an increase in the wild type CD3ζ mRNA is associated with increased expression of ASF/SF2. Finally, we show a significant correlation between ASF/SF2 and CD3ζ protein levels in T cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Thus, our results identify ASF/SF2 as a novel factor in the regulation of alternative splicing of the 3′-UTR of CD3ζ and protein expression in human T cells.

https://openalex.org/W1974648187,"Maspin (SERPINB5) is a tumor suppressor lost in breast and prostate cancer whose molecular function is unknown. It is a non-inhibitory member of the clade B serpins suggested to play a role in a plethora of intracellular and extracellular settings, yet its normal cellular distribution has never been clarified. Here we investigate the distribution of maspin in non-transformed human epithelial cells. By indirect immunofluorescence, maspin has a nucleocytoplasmic distribution in breast (MCF10A) and prostate (RWPE-1) cells and, by immunoblotting and pulse-chase analyses, is neither glycosylated nor secreted. Cell surface biotinylation studies also show that maspin is not present at the cell surface. Differentiation of MCF10A cells into three-dimensional acini results in the redistribution of maspin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but does not result in secretion. Addition of an efficient conventional signal peptide to maspin directs it into the secretory pathway and results in glycosylation but not secretion. We further show that maspin in the cytoplasm of MCF10A cells is a soluble monomeric protein that is not detectably associated with the cytoskeleton or other extractable components. Taken together, these results suggest that maspin is restricted to an intracellular, possibly nuclear, role in which it influences cell-matrix interactions indirectly. It is probably released only as a consequence of cell damage or necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2064818259,"Erythropoietic activity is known to affect iron homeostasis through regulation of the liver iron regulatory hormone hepcidin. To identify new factors secreted by the erythroblasts that could influence hepcidin synthesis, we set up a coculture model. HuH7 hepatoma cells cocultured with primary human erythroblasts or erythroleukemic UT7 cells presented a 20-to 35-fold increase of hepcidin gene expression. This induction was fully blunted in the presence of a neutralizing oncostatin M antibody, demonstrating that this cytokine, belonging to the IL-6 family of cytokines, was responsible for increased levels of hepcidin expression. We further demonstrated that recombinant oncostatin M induced a dramatic transcriptional increase of hepcidin in HuH7 cells through specific activation of the STAT pathway. Hepcidin induction by oncostatin M was also observed in hepatocytes in primary culture and is believed to be cell specific since no induction was found in isolated bone marrow cells, macrophagic, stromal, and lymphoma-derived cell lines, nor in erythroblasts. Finally, we show that oncostatin M administration in vivo increases hepcidin expression and leads to significantly decreased serum iron levels. This work identifies a new potent inducer of hepcidin expression in the liver and supports a role for modulators of oncostatin M signaling pathway in treating iron disorders.—Chung, B., Verdier, F., Matak, P., Deschemin, J.-C, Mayeux, P., Vaulont, S.

https://openalex.org/W2026441558,"FOXO transcription factors represent targets of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B survival pathway controlling important biological processes, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, vascular remodeling, stress responses, and metabolism. Recent studies suggested the existence of alternative mechanisms of FOXO-dependent gene expression beyond classical binding to a FOXO-responsive DNA-binding element (FRE). Here we analyzed the relative contribution of those mechanisms to vascular function by comparing the transcriptional and cellular responses to conditional activation of FOXO3 and a corresponding FRE-binding mutant in human primary endothelial cells. We demonstrate that FOXO3 controls expression of vascular remodeling genes in an FRE-dependent manner. In contrast, FOXO3-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis occurs independently of FRE binding, albeit FRE-dependent gene expression augments the proapoptotic response. These findings are supported by bioinformatical analysis, which revealed a statistical overrepresentation of cell cycle regulators and apoptosis-related genes in the group of co-regulated genes. Molecular analysis of FOXO3-induced endothelial apoptosis excluded modulators of the extrinsic death receptor pathway and demonstrated important roles for the BCL-2 family members BIM and NOXA in this process. Although NOXA essentially contributed to FRE-dependent apoptosis, BIM was effectively induced in the absence of FRE-binding, and small interfering RNA-mediated BIM depletion could rescue apoptosis induced by both FOXO3 mutants. These data suggest BIM as a critical cell type-specific mediator of FOXO3-induced endothelial apoptosis, whereas NOXA functions as an amplifying factor. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of alternatively regulated FOXO3 targets in relevant primary cells and underscores the importance of such genes for endothelial function and integrity."

HO-1 levels decrease in endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia, whereas the effect of hypoxia on HO-2 expression is unknown. The current study was carried out to determine if hypoxia alters HO-2 protein levels in human endothelial cells and whether this enzyme plays a role in preserving their viability during hypoxic stress. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), and human blood outgrowth endothelial cells were exposed to 21% or 1% O2 for 48 or 16 h in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml) or H2O2 (100 μm). In all three endothelial cell types HO-1 mRNA and protein levels were decreased following hypoxic incubation, whereas HO-2 protein levels were unaltered. In HUVECs HO-2 levels were maintained during hypoxia despite a 57% reduction in steady-state HO-2 mRNA level and a 43% reduction in total protein synthesis. Polysome profiling revealed increased HO-2 transcript association with polysomes during hypoxia consistent with enhanced translation of these transcripts. Importantly, inhibition of HO-2 expression by small interference RNA increased oxidative stress, exacerbated mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and enhanced caspase activation and apoptotic cell death in cells incubated under hypoxic but not normoxic conditions.

Hypoxia is frequently observed in patients with shock and cardiopulmonary diseases and in normal subjects at high altitudes.

Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland), were cultured in EGM-2 medium according to manufacturer's instructions. Human blood outgrowth endothelial cells (HBOECs) were derived from peripheral blood as described previously (10.Foltz W.D. Ormiston M.L. Stewart D.J. Courtman D.W. Dick A.J. Biomaterials. 2008; 29: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Healthy volunteers underwent a mononuclear cell collection (100 ml, 3–8% hematocrit) using a Cobe Spectra apheresis system (Gambro, Denver, CO). Cells were cultured in EGM-2MV medium containing 20% human serum in tissue culture flasks pre-coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) between 7 and 14 days to obtain a pure population of HBOECs. HBOECs were characterized by the surface expression of CD34, VEGFR2, CD146, and CD31 and stained negatively for CD14 and CD45. Early passage HUVECs (passages 3 and 4) and HAECs (passages 5–7) derived from multiple donors were used in these studies. Cells exposed to hypoxia were grown to 70% confluence and transferred, after changing the medium, to a humidified Plexiglas chamber maintained at 37 °C and continuously flushed with gas composed of 1% O2/5% CO2/balance N2. Normoxic control cells were exposed to air/5% CO2/balance N2 under otherwise identical conditions. HUVECs and HAECs (105 cells/cm2) were seeded in antibiotic-free EGM-2 media in 60-mm dishes for 16–24 h and transfected with human HO-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), HO-2 siRNA, HO-1 and -2 siRNA, or nonspecific control siRNA using siRNA Transfection Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were replated after 24 h in either 60-mm dishes (for flow cytometry studies) or 12-well plates (for measuring reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane depolarization studies). Total RNA was extracted from HUVECs incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 or 48 h using the Protein and RNA Isolation System from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit containing random primers (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses were performed in triplicate using SYBR® green with the ABI PRISM 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Levels of HO-1 and -2 cDNA were detected using the following primers: HO-1 (sense, 5′-GTC CGC AAC CCG ACA G-3′; antisense, 5′-ACC AGC TTG AAG CCG TCT C-3′, exon 1/2); HO-2 (sense, 5′-CCC TGG ACC TGA ACA TGA A-3′; antisense, 5′-ACC CAT CCT CCA AGG TCT C-3′, exon 4/5). The exponential portion of the amplification curve for 1000 copies of target amplicon passed through the cycle threshold (CT1000) at 24.34 ± 0.63 cycles for HO-1 and 24.35 ± 0.30 cycles for HO-2. 28 S (sense, 5′-TTG AAA ATC CGG GGG AGA G-3′; antisense, 5′-ACA TTG TTC CAA CAT GCC AG-3′) ribosomal RNA levels were used as a controls for normalization. Results obtained under each experimental condition were compared with their corresponding normoxic control values. Total protein was extracted from HUVECs, HAECs, and HBOECs incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 or 48 h using the Protein and RNA Isolation System kit. After protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method, total proteins (20 μg/lane) were resolved by 8–16% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. To detect HO-1 and -2 protein, membranes were blocked in 5% milk-TTBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HO-1 (1:2,000, Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI) or anti-HO-2 (1:2,000, Assay Designs) antibody overnight followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,500). HO-1 and -2 protein levels were normalized to β-actin detected by reprobing the membranes with anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:40,000, Sigma). The immunocomplexes were visualized with the ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by digital densitometry using the Quantity One software provided by Bio-Rad Laboratories. Results obtained under each experimental condition were compared with their corresponding normoxic control values. HUVECs plated in 12-well plates were incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 or 48 h. As described (11.Bitzan M.M. Wang Y. Lin J. Marsden P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), [3H]uridine or [3H]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to media (10 μCi/well) for the last 15, 30, 45, or 60 min of normoxic or hypoxic exposure. Cells were washed with cold PBS, incubated in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min, washed 3 times with 100% ethanol, and dried at 45 °C. The residues were dissolved in 0.3 n NaOH for 20 min and neutralized with 0.3 n HCl. The resultant mixture (400 μl) from each well was added to 5 ml of scintillation fluid, and radioactivity in each sample was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The rate of [3H]leucine or [3H]uridine incorporation is represented by the slope of the radioactivity-incubation time relationship. To determine the rate of HO-1 and -2 synthesis, HUVECs were incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 14 h and then in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (10 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for an additional 2 h at the same O2 concentrations. To determine HO-1 and -2 protein stability, HUVECs were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium at 21% O2 for 3 h and chased in EGM-2 media under 1% or 21% O2 for up to 24 h. Total proteins were extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal CA630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and quantified by the Lowry method. Cell lysates (500 μg), precleared with protein G-Sepharose, were then immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal anti-HO-1 (1:50) or anti-HO-2 (1:50) antibodies overnight. The resulting immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. As described (12.Fish J.E. Matouk C.C. Yeboah E. Bevan S.C. Khan M. Patil K. Ohh M. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15652-15666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), HUVECs were incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 6 h. At the end of the exposure periods, cells were washed with PBS containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and lysed using 200 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1000 units/ml RNAseOUT). After centrifugation to remove cell debris, supernatants were layered onto a 10-ml sucrose gradient (15–45%) and centrifuged for 2 h at 35,000 rpm. A programmable density gradient fraction collector with continuous spectrophotometric measurement at A254 nm was used to divide the gradient into 16 fractions. RNA extracted from each of the fractions was treated with DNase, reverse transcribed using random hexamers, and HO-2 transcripts in each fraction were quantified using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured in intact HUVECs using carboxy-5-(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA, Invitrogen). This method is based on the oxidation of non-fluorescent carboxy-H2DCFDA resulting in the formation of the fluorescent compound 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The fluorescence generated by DCF is proportional to the rate of carboxy-H2DCFDA oxidation, which is in turn indicative of the cellular oxidizing activity and intracellular ROS levels. HUVECs grown to 70% confluence in 12-well plates were incubated with water, TNF-α (10 ng/ml), or H2O2 (100 μm) prior to incubation at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 or 48 h. Cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and then incubated in HBSS containing carboxy-H2DCFDA (15 μm) for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. After rinsing with HBSS once to remove free probe, fluorescence (Ex484 nm/Em518 nm) from each well was measured using the Fluroskan Ascent & FL fluorescent plate reader (Thermo Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). The cell number in each well was counted using the Z2 Coulter particle count and size analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) so that fluorescence could be normalized to cell number. Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane was detected using the cationic dye, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1, Invitrogen). JC-1 localizes to and aggregates within the mitochondria in proportion to mitochondrial membrane potential, emitting red fluorescence. Upon depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane JC-1 forms monomers that emit green fluorescence. Differences in the ratio of red to green fluorescence are representative of changes in mitochondrial membrane depolarization. HUVECs grown to 70% confluence in 12-well plates were incubated with water, TNF-α (10 ng/ml), or H2O2 (100 μm), prior to incubation at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 or 48 h. At the end of the exposure period, HUVECs were incubated with PBS containing JC-1 (2 μm) for 15 min in the dark. Cells were then washed once with PBS, and fluorescence (Ex485 nm/Em518 nm (green) and Ex544 nm /Em590 nm (red)) was measured using the Fluroskan Ascent & FL fluorescent plate reader (Thermo Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). The Annexin V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to detect phosphatidylserine externalization (a marker of apoptosis) in HUVECs and HAECs incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 or 48 h. HUVECs and HAECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2 were incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 h. Cells in the media were included in the experiment. After trypsinization, cells were washed once with PBS before the addition of 100 μl of labeling solution containing 2 μl of Annexin V-Fluos labeling reagent and 2 μl of propidium iodide (PI) solution. Cells were analyzed using the cytomicsTM FC 500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Total caspase activation was measured in HUVECs and HAECs incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 or 48 h and in HUVECs and HAECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2 incubated at 1% or 21% O2 for 16 h. FITC-VAD-FMK is an FITC conjugate of the cell-permeable inhibitor of caspases (Promega, Madison, WI). This structure allows delivery of the inhibitor into the cell where binding to activated caspase serves as an in situ marker for apoptosis. After trypsinization, cells were suspended in PBS containing FITC-VAD-FMK (1 μm) at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Cells were then washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed using the cytomicsTM FC 500 flow cytometer. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. for n number of independent experiments with p < 0.05 representing statistical significance. The significance of differences between individual means was determined by two-tailed Student's t test. Differences among multiple means were evaluated by analysis of variance corrected for multiple measures where appropriate, and, when overall differences were detected, differences between individual means were evaluated post-hoc using the Student-Newman-Keuls procedure. To determine the effects of hypoxia on the expression of HO-1 and -2 mRNA and protein, these levels were compared in HUVECs incubated under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for 16 and 48 h. After 16 and 48 h of hypoxia, steady-state HO-1 mRNA levels are reduced to 27.82 ± 1.80% and 30.71 ± 7.23% of the corresponding normoxic control values, respectively (Fig. 1A). Steady-state HO-2 mRNA expression was decreased (42.93 ± 7.52% of normoxic control, Fig. 1B) after 16 h of hypoxia and returned to the normoxic control level after 48 h. Steady-state HO-1 protein (Fig. 1C) is reduced after 16 and 48 h of hypoxia (79.57 ± 2.11% and 64.93 ± 5.75% of normoxic control values, respectively), whereas steady-state HO-2 protein levels were unaltered (Fig. 1D). To corroborate this finding in other systemic vascular endothelial cells, steady-state HO-1 and -2 proteins were also measured in HAECs and HBOECs incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 2, hypoxia decreased steady-state HO-1 protein levels in both HAECs and HBOECs (38.50 ± 8.47% and 59.10 ± 8.85% of normoxic control values, respectively), but, as in HUVECs, steady-state HO-2 was unaltered.FIGURE 2HO-1 (A) and HO-2 (B) protein levels in HAECs and blood outgrowth endothelial cells exposed to 21% or 1% oxygen for 16 h.Bars represent means ± S.E.

Protein synthesis was reduced to 56.60 ± 2.77% at 16 h and 34.80 ± 2.97% of the normoxic control value (Fig. 3B) at 48 h. Results of [35S]methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation using HO-2 antibody (Fig. 3C) indicate that the synthesis of HO-2 protein was higher than HO-1 protein during hypoxia (74.80 ± 7.80% versus 47.01 ± 6.55% of normoxic control values, respectively). The relative preservation of HO-2 protein synthesis, despite the 57% reduction in HO-2 steady-state mRNA level and 43% reduction in total protein synthesis, suggests that HO-2 protein expression was preserved during hypoxia, possibly through enhanced translation. To directly determine the effect of hypoxia on HO-2 translation, ribosomal association of HO-2 mRNA was assessed by polysome profiling. As shown in Fig. 3D, HO-2 mRNA are located in higher polysome fractions after hypoxic incubation, which, together with the results of the metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation studies, support enhanced translation of HO-2 transcripts during hypoxia. To assess the effect of hypoxia on HO-1 and -2 protein stability, HUVECs were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 3 h and chased with EGM-2 media for up to 24 h under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 3E, hypoxia increased HO-2 protein degradation, reducing its half-life from 10.77 ± 2.73 h to 4.78 ± 0.74 h. In contrast, hypoxia had no dramatic effect on HO-1 protein stability. HO-1 protein half-life was 17.77 ± 8.68 h and 22.83 ± 6.22 h in HUVECs exposed to normoxia or hypoxia, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). HO-2 protects cells from oxidative stress by reducing intracellular concentrations of heme (a pro-oxidant) and by increasing levels of bilirubin and ferritin, which are potent anti-oxidants. To determine the importance of HO-2 in protecting cells from oxidative stress during hypoxia, we compared the level of ROS in HUVECs transfected with nonspecific or HO-2 siRNA exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 16 or 48 h, and also in HUVECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2 exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 16 h. Fig. 4A is a representative blot of the extent of HO-2 protein inhibition using HO-2 siRNA. Inhibition of HO-2 protein expression had no effect on HO-1 protein level under any of the conditions tested (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 4B, exposure to hypoxia for 16 or 48 h increases ROS levels in HUVECs. Compared with the nonspecific siRNA control, inhibition of HO-2 expression increased ROS levels in HUVECs exposed to hypoxia for 48 h, but had no effect at the 16-h time point or in cells incubated under normoxic conditions. In HUVECs exposed to hypoxia for 16 h that were also treated with TNF-α or H2O2, inhibition of HO-2 expression increased ROS levels (Fig. 4C). Both hypoxia and oxidative stress may trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis) or necrosis depending on their severity/magnitude. To determine the functional significance of preservation of HO-2 levels during hypoxia, the effect of inhibiting HO-2 expression using HO-2 siRNA on HUVEC viability during hypoxia in the presence or absence of TNF-α or H2O2 was assessed. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization is an early event in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway activated by hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 5A the ratio of JC-1 aggregates/JC-1 monomer was decreased during hypoxia, indicating mitochondrial membrane depolarization (13.Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HO-2 expression was associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization in cells incubated under normoxic conditions and exacerbated it in cells exposed to hypoxia for 48 h (Fig. 5A) indicating that HO-2 protein or its activity increased the capacity to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential. In HUVECs treated with TNF-α, inhibition of HO-2 enhanced mitochondrial membrane depolarization in normoxic but not in hypoxic cells. Inhibition of HO-2 enhanced mitochondrial membrane depolarization in both normoxic and hypoxic cells treated with H2O2 (Fig. 5B). Annexin V/PI staining was used to detect externalization of phosphatidylserine, an early event in apoptosis, and cell membrane permeabilization, an indicator of cell death. Representative plots of annexin V/PI staining are shown in Fig. 6A. Non-viable cells are cells that are stained by annexin V and/or PI (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6B demonstrates that exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia for 48 h increased cell death and that cell death was further increased by inhibition of HO-2 expression. In HUVECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2, inhibition of HO-2 expression had no effect on normoxic cells and increased cell death after hypoxic exposure for 16 h (Fig. 6C). To confirm that the effect of decreased HO-2 activity on cell viability was mediated by increased apoptosis, caspase activation was assessed in HUVECs exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 16 or 48 h and in HUVECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2 exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 16 h. In HUVECs in which HO-2 protein expression was inhibited, exposure to hypoxia for 48 h increased activated caspase levels by 1.5-fold compared with nonspecific siRNA control (supplemental Fig. S2A). Total activated caspase was also increased in HUVECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2 and exposed to hypoxia for 16 h (supplemental Fig. S2B). To confirm the cytoprotective effect of HO-2 protein during hypoxia is not specific to HUVECs, annexin V/PI staining and total activated caspase levels were assessed in HAECs exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 48 h and in HAECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2 exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 16 h. Inhibition of HO-2 increased cell death in normoxic and hypoxic HAECs (Fig. 7A) and in HAECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2 (Fig. 7C). When HO-2 expression was suppressed, the total activated caspase level increased in HAECs exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 48 h and in normoxic and hypoxic HAECs treated with TNF-α or H2O2 (Fig. 7, B and D). The results of this study show that in human endothelial cells incubated under hypoxic conditions: 1) steady-state HO-1 mRNA and protein levels were decreased; 2) steady-state HO-2 protein level was unaltered despite a 57% reduction in steady-state HO-2 mRNA level, a 43% reduction in total protein synthesis, and increased HO-2 protein degradation; 3) HO-2 protein level was maintained through enhanced translation of HO-2 transcripts; and 4) inhibition of HO-2 expression increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and apoptotic cell death. Previous studies indicate cell type- and species-dependent differences in the regulation of HO expression by hypoxia. Aortic HO-2 protein is increased in rats exposed to hypoxia (7.Govindaraju V.

https://openalex.org/W2142752926,"YajL is the closest prokaryotic homolog of the parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1 (40% sequence identity and similar three-dimensional structure), a protein of unknown function involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress. We report here that a yajL mutant of Escherichia coli displays an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. It also exhibits a protein aggregation phenotype in aerobiosis, but not in anaerobiosis or in aerobic cells overexpressing superoxide dismutase, suggesting that protein aggregation depends on the presence of reactive oxygen species produced by respiratory chains. The protein aggregation phenotype of the yajL mutant, which can be rescued by the wild-type yajL gene, but not by the corresponding cysteine 106 mutant allele, is similar to that of multiple mutants deficient in superoxide dismutases and catalases, although intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels were not increased in the yajL mutant, suggesting that protein aggregation in this strain does not result from a hydrogen peroxide detoxification defect. Aggregation-prone proteins included 17 ribosomal proteins, the ATP synthase beta subunit, flagellin, and the outer membrane proteins OmpA and PAL; all of them are part of multiprotein complexes, suggesting that YajL might be involved in optimal expression of these complexes, especially during oxidative stress. YajL stimulated the renaturation of urea-unfolded citrate synthase and the solubilization of the urea-unfolded ribosomal proteins S1 and L3 and was more efficient as a chaperone in its oxidized form than in its reduced form. The mRNA levels of several aggregated proteins of the yajL mutant were severely affected, suggesting that YajL also acts at the level of gene expression. These two functions of YajL might explain the protein aggregation phenotype of the yajL mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2101064986,"The UDP-sugar interconverting enzymes involved in UDP-GlcA metabolism are well described in eukaryotes but less is known in prokaryotes. Here we identify and characterize a gene (RsU4kpxs) from Ralstonia solanacearum str. GMI1000, which encodes a dual function enzyme not previously described. One activity is to decarboxylate UDP-glucuronic acid to UDP-beta-l-threo-pentopyranosyl-4''-ulose in the presence of NAD(+). The second activity converts UDP-beta-l-threo-pentopyranosyl-4''-ulose and NADH to UDP-xylose and NAD(+), albeit at a lower rate. Our data also suggest that following decarboxylation, there is stereospecific protonation at the C5 pro-R position. The identification of the R. solanacearum enzyme enables us to propose that the ancestral enzyme of UDP-xylose synthase and UDP-apiose/UDP-xylose synthase was diverged to two distinct enzymatic activities in early bacteria. This separation gave rise to the current UDP-xylose synthase in animal, fungus, and plant as well as to the plant Uaxs and bacterial ArnA and U4kpxs homologs."
https://openalex.org/W1978036404,"Renin is a key enzyme for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis and is produced by highly specialized endocrine cells in the kidney, known as juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. The nature and origin of these cells remain as mysteries. Previously, we have shown that the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor-alpha (LXRalpha) is a major transcriptional regulator of the expression of renin, c-myc, and other genes involved with growth/differentiation. In this study we test the hypothesis that LXRalpha plays an important role not only in renin expression but also in renin-containing cell differentiation, specifically from the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), which may be the origin of the JG cell. Indeed, our data demonstrated that LXRalpha activation by its ligands or cAMP stimulated renin gene expression in both murine and human MSCs. Furthermore, sustained cAMP stimulation of murine MSCs overexpressing LXRalpha led to their differentiation into JG-like cells expressing renin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. These MSC-derived JG-like cells contained renin in secretory granules and released active renin in response to cAMP. In conclusion, the activation of LXRalpha stimulates renin expression and induces MSCs differentiation into renin-secreting, JG-like cells. Our results suggest that the MSC may be the origin of the juxtaglomerular cell and provide insight into novel understanding of pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin system."
https://openalex.org/W2036577027,"M-type (KCNQ) potassium channels play an important role in regulating the action potential firing in neurons. Here, we investigated the effect of cholesterol on M current in superior cervical ganglion (SCG) sympathetic neurons, using the patch clamp technique. M current was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by cholesterol loading with a methyl-β-cyclodextrin-cholesterol complex. This effect was prevented when membrane cholesterol level was restored by including empty methyl-β-cyclodextrin in the pipette solution. Dialysis of cells with AMP-PNP instead of ATP prevented cholesterol action on M currents. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, calphostin C, abolished cholesterol-induced inhibition whereas the PKC activator, PDBu, mimicked the inhibition of M currents by cholesterol. The in vitro kinase assay showed that KCNQ2 subunits of M channel can be phosphorylated by PKC. A KCNQ2 mutant that is defective in phosphorylation by PKC failed to show current inhibition not only by PDBu but also by cholesterol. These results indicate that cholesterol-induced inhibition of M currents is mediated by PKC phosphorylation. The inhibition of M currents by PDBu and cholesterol was completely blocked by PIP2 loading, indicating that the decrease in PIP2-channel interaction underlies M channel inhibition by PKC-mediated phosphorylation.

Cholesterol is probably one of the most notorious natural substances because of its crucial role in major human diseases such as arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease (1.Libby P. Aikawa M.

On the other hand, cholesterol is an essential component of the membranes that determines their biophysical properties such as fluidity, lateral pressure profile, and bilayer thickness (4.Spector A.A.

Recently, lipid molecules have been found to act as signaling molecules (11.Hilgemann D.W. Science. 2004; 304: 223-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12.Liu L. Barrett C.F.

However, now, PIP2 is also known as a signal mediator in the regulation of numerous ion channels including ATP-sensitive K+ channel (15.Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. Nat. Rev.

Even though cholesterol has multiple roles, however, it is unclear whether it also acts as a signaling molecule. Recently, it was shown that cholesterol, itself, modulated inwardly rectifying K+ (IRK) channel activity in vascular endothelial cells (21.Mohler 3rd, E.R. Fang Y. Shaffer R.G. Moore J. Wilensky R.L.

These observations raised these questions: how does cholesterol regulate channel activity and does it also regulate other ion channels? Until now, the mechanism underlying cholesterol action on ion channels has not been clarified (24.Toselli M. Biella G. Taglietti V. Cazzaniga E. Parenti M. Biophys.

Physiol. 2008; 586: 1811-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This time- and voltage-dependent K+ current has a threshold for activation at typical neuronal resting potentials, with greater activity upon depolarization. This characteristic makes the M channel function as a brake on repetitive action potential discharges and, as such, has a key role in regulating the excitability of various central and peripheral neurons, including sympathetic neurons, hippocampal pyramidal cells, and striatal neurons (25.Delmas P. Brown D.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 850-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In vivo, a number of neurotransmitters and other endogenous and exogenous factors can close M channels, releasing the brake and allowing undiminished action potential firing (25.Delmas P. Brown D.A.

On the other hand, bradykinin and purinergic receptors were suggested to suppress M current via calmodulin (26.Hernandez C.C. Zaika O. Tolstykh G.P. Shapiro M.S. J.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of cholesterol in the regulation of M channels in sympathetic neurons of the rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG). The results of the present study show that cholesterol inhibited M channel activity in a dose-dependent manner. We found several lines of evidence for PKC involvement in inhibition of M channel by cholesterol. We then found that exogenous PIP2 application effectively abolished the M current inhibition induced not only by a PKC activator but also by cholesterol. From these results, we suggest that the inhibition of M current by cholesterol in SCG neurons is via decrease in channel-PIP2 interaction. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that cholesterol is acting as a signal molecule in the regulation of KCNQ channels through PKC pathway. Plasmids encoding human KCNQ2 (GenBankTM accession number AF110020) were kindly given to us by Mark Shapiro (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). To construct the Myc-tagged KCNQ2 expression vector, the entire coding region of KCNQ2 by performing PCR with the following oligonucleotides: 5-TAGAATTCATGGTGCAGAAGTCGCGCAACGGC-3 and 5-TCACTTCCTGGGCCCGGCCCA-3. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into a pENTR3C vector (Invitrogen). Myc-KCNQ2 was constructed in the pDEST-CS3-MT vector using the Gateway LR reaction (Invitrogen). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate KCNQ2 mutant (S527A). For expression in Escherichia coli, fragment of KCNQ2 (amino acids 491–633) was amplified by Pfu polymerase with the following oligonucleotides: 5-TAGGATCCAGCTGCCCCTGCGAGTTTGTGACC-3 and 5-CGGCTCTTTGGCCCCAAAGTA-3. The amplified PCR product was digested with BamHI and was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells were handled as previously described (32.Cho H. Kim Y.A. Ho W.K. Mol. Cells. 2006; 22: 97-103PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were made using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a reporter. SCG neurons were cultured from juvenile rats as previously described (33.Gamper N. Reznikov V. Yamada Y. Yang J. Shapiro M.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10980-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee at Sungkyunkwan University. Current measurements were made with the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Voltage-clamp was performed by using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Instruments) and filtered at 10 kHz. The patch pipettes (World Precision Instruments, Inc.) were made by a Narishige puller (PP-830, Narishige, Tokyo). The patch pipettes used had a resistance of 2–3 MΩ when filled with the pipette solutions listed in the next sections. The pipette capacitance was compensated after formation of a gigaohm seal. Access resistance was typically 2.8–3.2 MΩ, and it was not significantly altered by cholesterol loading. Series-resistance compensation was not used. Because IM amplitudes were typically 0.1 nA, this implies a series-resistance voltage error of ∼0.5 mV. For the dialysis, we waited >5 min before starting the experiment. Because M currents were obtained by difference currents revealed by XE-991 and those procedures could eliminate the possible contamination of leak current, we did not use leak current subtraction. Data were not corrected for the liquid junction potential (−9 mV). The M currents in SCG neurons were fully activated by setting the holding potential (Vh) at −60 mV and further deactivated by 1-s pulses from −20 mV to −60 mV, every 5 s. The KCNQ2 currents from HEK cells were studied by holding the cell at −20 mV, and 1-s hyperpolarizing steps to −60 mV were applied, followed by 1-s pulses back to −20 mV. The amplitude of the current was usually defined as the difference between the holding current at −20 mV, and the current at the beginning (after any capacity current had subsided) of the 1-s pulse back to −20 mV. In some cells, a more precise measurement was the XE991-sensitive current at the holding potential of −20 mV. The perfusion system was a homemade 100-μl perfusion chamber through which solution flowed continuously at 5 ml/min. All recordings were carried out at room temperature. In vitro kinase assays for PKC were performed as described earlier (34.Soh J.W. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34709-34716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were prepared from 293T cells, which had been transfected with PKC expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. I. B. Weinstein, Columbia University, New York) or control vector pcDNA3 by resuspending cells in PKC extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors, (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). After brief sonication, the lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Cleared supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (Roche) and protein A/G-agarose (Calbiochem.), the beads were washed three times with NETN buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then twice with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The immunoprecipitate was resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-KCNQ2 wild-type or S527A mutant proteins. The kinase reaction was conducted at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoprecipitated HA-PKCs were confirmed by Western blotting with α-HA antibody. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized and quantified on BAS (Fuji). Recombinant GST-KCNQ2 wild-type or S527A mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified to homogeneity using glutathione S-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The normal external solution for HEK293 cell and rat SCG neuron recording was as follows (in mm): 143 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 5 HEPES, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 11.1 glucose, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. The pipette solution was as follows (in mm): 140 KMeSO4, 20 KCl, 20 HEPES, 0.5 Na-GTP, 5 Mg-ATP, 4 Vit C, 10 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH. Drugs were obtained as follows: water soluble-cholesterol (MβCD/Chol), MβCD, AMP-PNP (Sigma); calphostin C, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), 4α-PDBu (Biomol); diC8-PIP2 (Echelon); Fura 2-AM (Invitrogen); and XE991 (Tocris). HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with phospholipase C (PLC)δ-PH-GFP and M1 receptor. One day after transfection, the coverslips were placed into a flow-through chamber. The fluorescence images were obtained in a Zeiss 510 confocal laser scanning microscope with a 488-nm excitation line and 505–545-nm emission filter. Determination of the fluorescence was accomplished by assigning regions of interest in the cytosol and membrane. Cells grown in 100-mm plates were assayed in duplicate for cholesterol using the Amplex red cholesterol kit from Molecular Probes. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized with hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovandate) using a 22-gauge needle. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. Membranes were pelleted from the postnuclear supernatants by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and assayed according to the supplier's instructions. Currents were analyzed and fitted using PULSE (HEKA Instrument) and Origin 6.1 (Originlab) software. Data were expressed as the mean or percentage change ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. The difference between two groups was considered to be significant with p < 0.01 and not significant with p > 0.05. M current was measured using a standard voltage-clamp protocol (Fig. 1A, inset) (35.Liu B. Liang H. Liu L. Zhang H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C81-C91Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Application of the hyperpolarizing test pulse resulted in a slowly deactivating whole cell current, characteristic of the M current, which was inhibited by the specific M channel blocker, XE991 (20 μm) (36.Zaika O. Lara L.S. Gamper N. Hilgemann D.W. Jaffe D.B. Shapiro M.S. J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In subsequent voltage-clamp experiments, we termed the M current the XE991-sensitive component of the slowly deactivating current produced by stepping the membrane voltage from −20 to −60 mV. MβCD is a water-soluble cyclic oligosaccharide that enhances the solubility of cholesterol by incorporating it into a hydrophobic cavity (37.Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treating cells with cholesterol-free or cholesterol-loaded MβCD (MβCD/Chol) has been widely used to selectively and efficiently reduce or enhance the cholesterol content of the membrane (22.Romanenko V.G. Rothblat G.H. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3211-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23.Guo J. Chi S. Xu H. Jin G. Qi Z. Mol. Membr.

J. 2005; 89: 2443-2457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We applied an MβCD/Chol complex to increase the cholesterol content of the cell membrane. Application of 150 μm MβCD/Chol to the bath solution resulted in a dramatic and sustained reduction in M current (Fig. 1A). We then examined the dose-inhibition relationship for cholesterol in Fig. 1B. Various concentrations of cholesterol were applied in a cumulative manner. The extent of current inhibition became larger as cholesterol concentration increased (Fig. 1, B and D); the extent of inhibition induced by 10, 150, and 500 μm MβCD/Chol was 23.1 ± 3.1% (n = 4), 54.8 ± 3.7% (n = 15), and 75.4 ± 5.2% (n = 5), respectively. The effect of MβCD/Chol on M currents usually reached a plateau within 5 min of application (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3F). Because 500 μm MβCD/Chol was not easily dissolved into the bath solution, 150 μm MβCD/Chol was used in subsequent experiments.FIGURE 2Cholesterol did not induce a PIP2 hydrolysis. A, translocation of membrane-localized PLCδ-PH to the cytosol reports PIP2 hydrolysis by cholesterol and muscarinic stimulation in HEK cells. B, plot of fluorescence intensity across a single line scan (A, white line) before and during the cholesterol (150 μm) or the Oxo-M (10 μm) response. C, continuous time plot of cytosolic fluorescence intensity recorded in a single region of interest (A, white circle). D, bars summarize the normalized cytosolic fluorescence increase by cholesterol and muscarinic stimulation. The change in fluorescence is given as ΔF/F0 × 100%, where ΔF = F − F0, F is peak fluorescence after drug application, and F0 is baseline fluorescence before agonist application.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because cholesterol molecules readily “flip-flop” between inner and outer membrane leaflets with half times on the order of second (38.Hamilton J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), cholesterol would be expected to affect M currents via the internal side of the membrane. We confirmed this point by showing that application of 150 μm MβCD/Chol to the internal surface of the membrane induced 47.1 ± 10.1% (n = 4), compatible with those induced by external application of 150 μm MβCD/Chol (p > 0.05, supplemental Fig. S1). Cholesterol-induced inhibition was abolished when the level of cholesterol in the membrane was restored by including empty MβCD in the pipette solution (Fig. 1C). The inhibitory effect of MβCD/Chol was reduced to 20.2 ± 5.2% (n = 5, p < 0.01, Fig. 1D). MβCD itself did not significantly affect M currents. After a 5-min dialysis with pipette solution containing MβCD, the relative amplitude of M currents was not changed much from the current level obtained immediately after dialysis (104.4 ± 9.9%, n = 6). Bath-applied MβCD did not affect M currents either (supplemental Fig. S2). To verify the concept that MβCD/Chol-induced current inhibition was due to cholesterol loading of the cells, we monitored the cholesterol level using HEK cell system. We found that total cholesterol level in HEK cells that were not exposed to cholesterol was 28.9 ± 2.0 μg/mg protein (n = 8), similar to total cholesterol levels reported earlier for sympathetic neurons (39.Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and for other cell types (37.Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Kim J.A. Maxwell K. Hajjar D.P. Berliner J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1125-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of HEK cells to MβCD/Chol for 10 min resulted in a dose-dependent increase of cholesterol content; 10, 150, 500 μm MβCD/Chol increased the total cholesterol level by about 8%, 28 and 42%, respectively (n = 4–6). Incubation of cells with empty MβCD for 10 min decreased cholesterol content by 18% (n = 4). M channels require a certain level of PIP2 in the cell membrane to open (17.Suh B.C. Hille B. Neuron. 2002; 35: 507-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 18.Zhang H. Craciun L.C. Mirshahi T. Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Logothetis D.E.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3400-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that channel inhibition by cholesterol might result from the depletion of membrane PIP2 as a result of its hydrolysis. To examine whether cholesterol can induce PIP2 hydrolysis, we transfected HEK cells (using an effectene system, Molecular Probes) with an optical probe for PIP2, PLCδ-PH-GFP (41.Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe contained the PH domain of PLCδ that binds with high affinity to PIP2 and IP3. After transfection, we examined whether cholesterol induced membrane-to-cytosol translocation of the probe using a confocal microscope (Fig. 2A). Under basal conditions, PLCδ-PH-GFP was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane as shown by an intensity line plot (Fig. 2B). Application of cholesterol did not significantly change fluorescence intensity or its distribution in the cell. In contrast, stimulation of co-transfected M1 receptors caused robust translocation of PLCδ-PH-GFP from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (Fig. 2, A–C). Cytosolic fluorescence during muscarinic stimulation increased by 299.4 ± 41.8% (n = 3), whereas during cholesterol application, the fluorescence intensity in cytosol increased by 13.8 ± 4.6% (n = 3, p < 0.01, Fig. 2D). This result indicates that cholesterol addition caused very little PIP2 hydrolysis, and therefore PIP2 depletion was not a major mechanism in the inhibition of M current by cholesterol. In many cell types, cholesterol could activate protein kinases, including PKC (42.Sharma D.K. Brown J.C. Choudhury A. Peterson T.E. Holicky E. Marks D.L. Simari R. Parton R.G. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol.

To unravel the intracellular signaling cascade linking cholesterol and M current in SCG neurons, we examined whether the effects of cholesterol on M channels depends on PKC activation using the specific inhibitor, calphostin C. Fig. 3A shows that calphostin C almost completely blocked the modulation of M currents by cholesterol. In the presence of calphostin C, the cholesterol-mediated inhibition of M current was 7.7 ± 6.5% (n = 4), and it was significantly different from those observed in control cells (54.8 ± 3.7%, n = 15, p < 0.01; Fig. 3C). To confirm that the phosphorylation process was involved in cholesterol-induced modulation of M currents, the effect of AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, on cholesterol-induced modulation was tested (Fig. 3B). The presence of AMP-PNP (4 mm) in place of ATP in the internal solutions significantly blocked cholesterol-induced modulation of M currents, and inhibition of M currents was reduced to 24.3 ± 5.6% (n = 7, p < 0.01 versus control; 54.8 ± 3.7%, n = 15; Fig. 3C). To determine whether PKC regulates M current, we tested if direct activation of PKC by phorbol ester inhibits M current. In the control, the PKC activator PDBu significantly inhibited M current (Fig. 3D), whereas the inactive analog, 4α-PDBu, did not inhibit M current (Fig. 3E). The extent of inhibition induced by PDBu was 40.9 ± 8.5% (n = 4), whereas that induced by 4α-PDBu was 6.9 ± 4.8% (n = 5, p < 0.01, Fig. 3F). Furthermore, the extent and time course of inhibition of M current induced by PDBu was similar to those induced by cholesterol (Fig. 3F). These data suggest that PKC regulates M channels and effects of cholesterol on M channels depend on the PKC-induced phosphorylation process. We then examined whether M channels were phosphorylated by PKC. M channels in SCG neurons are known to be composed of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heterotetramers (45.Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown"
https://openalex.org/W1964340982,"Beta-propeller proteins function in catalysis, protein-protein interaction, cell cycle regulation, and innate immunity. The galactose-binding protein (GBP) from the plasma of the horseshoe crab, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, is a beta-propeller protein that functions in antimicrobial defense. Studies have shown that upon binding to Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), GBP interacts with C-reactive protein (CRP) to form a pathogen-recognition complex, which helps to eliminate invading microbes. However, the molecular basis of interactions between GBP and LPS and how it interplays with CRP remain largely unknown. By homology modeling, we showed that GBP contains six beta-propeller/Tectonin domains. Ligand docking indicated that Tectonin domains 6 to 1 likely contain the LPS binding sites. Protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated that Tectonin domain 4 interacts most strongly with CRP. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry mapped distinct sites of GBP that interact with LPS and with CRP, consistent with in silico predictions. Furthermore, infection condition (lowered Ca(2+) level) increases GBP-CRP affinity by 1000-fold. Resupplementing the system with a physiological level of Ca(2+) did not reverse the protein-protein affinity to the basal state, suggesting that the infection-induced complex had undergone irreversible conformational change. We propose that GBP serves as a bridging molecule, participating in molecular interactions, GBP-LPS and GBP-CRP, to form a stable pathogen-recognition complex. The interaction interfaces in these two partners suggest that Tectonin domains can differentiate self/nonself, crucial to frontline defense against infection. In addition, GBP shares architectural and functional homologies to a human protein, hTectonin, suggesting its evolutionarily conservation for approximately 500 million years, from horseshoe crab to human."

The adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) is an adhesin of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains. AIDA-I also mediates bacterial auto-aggregation and biofilm formation and thus could be important for the organization of communities of pathogens. Using purified protein and whole bacteria, we provide direct evidence that AIDA-I promotes auto-aggregation by interacting with itself. Using various biophysical and biochemical techniques, we observed a conformational change in the protein during AIDA-AIDA interactions, strengthening the notion that this is a highly specific interaction. The self-association of AIDA-I is of high affinity but can be modulated by sodium chloride. We observe that a bile salt, sodium deoxycholate, also prevents AIDA-I oligomerization and bacterial auto-aggregation. Thus, we propose that AIDA-I, and most likely other similar autotransporters such as antigen 43 (Ag43) and TibA, organize bacterial communities of pathogens through a self-recognition mechanism that is sensitive to the environment. This could permit bacteria to switch between multicellular and unicellular lifestyles to complete their infection.

https://openalex.org/W2018753497,"The cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1)/CARD4 and NOD2/CARD15 proteins are members of NOD-like receptors recognizing specific motifs within peptidoglycans of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. NOD1 and NOD2 signal via the downstream adaptor serine/threonine kinase RIP2/CARDIAK/RICK to initiate NF-kappaB activation and the release of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In this report, we show that 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), a cell-permeable, small molecule that has anti-tumor activity, can also activate NOD1 and NOD2. This was demonstrated: 1) by using human embryonic kidney epithelial (HEK) 293 cells transfected with a NF-kappaB reporter plasmid in combination with NOD1 or NOD2 expression plasmids; 2) by inhibiting DMXAA-induced chemokine (CXCL10) mRNA and protein production in the AB12 mesothelioma cell line using a pharmacological inhibitor of RICK kinase, SB20358; and 3) by using small interfering RNA to knock down NOD2 and lentiviral short hairpin RNA to knock down RICK. These findings expand the potential ligands for the NOD-like receptors, suggesting that other xanthone compounds may act similarly and could be developed as anti-tumor agents. This information also expands our knowledge on the mechanisms of action of the anti-tumor agent DMXAA (currently in clinical trials) and may be important for its biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1996213254,"Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that excise themselves from precursor RNAs and catalyze the joining of flanking exons. Excised introns can behave as parasitic RNA molecules: they can catalyze their own insertion into DNA and RNA via a reverse splicing reaction. Previous studies have identified mechanistic roles for various functional groups located in the catalytic core of the intron and within target molecules. Here we introduce a new method for synthesizing long RNA molecules with a modified nucleotide at the 3' terminus. This modification allows us to examine the mechanistic role of functional groups adjacent to the reaction nucleophile. During reverse splicing, the 3'-OH group of the intron terminus attacks the phosphodiester linkage of spliced exon sequences. Here we show that the adjacent 2'-OH group on the intron terminus plays an essential role in activating the nucleophile by stripping away a proton from the 3'-OH and then shuttling it from the active site."

https://openalex.org/W2025250920,"Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a serious health problem worldwide and is operationally defined as a resting systolic/diastolic blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg. The Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recently issued guidelines defining people with systolic blood pressures between 120 and 139 mm Hg and diastolic pressures between 80 and 89 mm Hg as “pre-hypertensive.” Those who fall into this category are more likely to develop frank hypertension and thus require active clinical intervention. Nearly one-quarter of the world's adult population is hypertensive! More than 75 million people in the United States alone are hypertensive, and an additional 50 million lie in the pre-hypertensive range. Most often, hypertension displays no overt symptomatology, hence the moniker “the silent killer.” In many, if not most, cases, the underlying etiology of the disease is unknown (essential hypertension). To complicate matters more, hypertension is a multifactorial disease, rarely resulting from a single identifiable cause or single gene mutation. Many factors influence blood pressure: whole-body salt and volume load, autonomic nervous system output, lipid and cholesterol metabolism, kidney disease, medications, and lifestyle activities, such as smoking, drinking, and exercise (or lack thereof). There is a multitude of genetic influences as well; some candidate high blood pressure genes include 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases B1 and B2; apolipoproteins A1, A2, and C2-C4; chloride-bicarbonate exchangers 1, 2, and 3; endothelin-1, -2, and -3; and vascular endothelial growth factors A, B, and C, just to mention a few. (At present, more than 150 genes are listed as potentially contributory to hypertension.) There is a plethora of sequelae that result from uncontrolled hypertension, and none of them is good: cardiovascular problems (e.g. heart failure), cerebral vascular problems (e.g. stroke), and renal problems (e.g. end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis and, ultimately, transplantation). Many biochemical processes are affected by hypertension; abnormalities or dysregulation of many biochemical pathways can contribute to the development of hypertension. This thematic minireview series will explore several novel aspects of the biochemistry of hypertension and how this biochemistry interfaces at the physiological and clinical levels. The first minireview, by Joseph A. Hill of the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, explores the role of cardiac cell autophagy in hypertension. The mechanisms of autophagy as related to hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling, ultimately contributing to ischemic heart disease and failure, will be examined. In the second minireview, Curt D. Sigmund, a professor of medicine and molecular physiology and biophysics at the University of Iowa and Director of the Center on the Functional Genomics of Hypertension at the university's Carver College of Medicine, summarizes the role that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ transcription factor plays in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells using genetically altered mouse models of hypertension. The third minireview in this series is by Rebecca P. Hughey and Thomas R. Kleyman, both of the Renal-Electrolyte Division at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. They examine the central position that a specific ion channel, namely ENaC (or the epithelial Na channel) has in Liddle disease. This autosomal recessive genetic disease produces severe hypertension and is caused by gain-of-function mutations within the genes encoding the C-terminal regions of the β- and/or γ-subunits of this renal distal tubular collecting duct-located ion channel. James K. Bubien, associate professor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, continues this theme in the fourth minireview by summarizing evidence that the hormonal stimulation of ENaC by aldosterone and insulin, two hormones elevated in obese individuals with therapy-resistant hypertension, may contribute to the hypertension that accompanies obesity. He also proposes a different paradigm in which the serum potassium level plays an important, if not critical, role in hypertension. The fifth and final minireview of this series is by John E. Hall, Associate Vice Chancellor for research at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and Editor-in-Chief of the journal Hypertension. The focus of his article is also obesity and hypertension. He discusses the obesity-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system by the leptin-melanocortin 4 receptor pathway. Thus, this minireview series explores several major biochemical axes that, when gone awry, contribute to the development of or are a consequence of hypertension. These include the sympathetic nervous system, the vascular and cardiac systems, and critical transport systems in the kidney. It is the overall goal of this thematic minireview series to link biochemical processes to the understanding of the important clinical problem of hypertension. By emphasizing a strong connection between laboratory research and clinical medicine, we hope to stimulate interest in this specific translational topic among biochemists, clinicians, and graduate and medical students. It is also hoped that an appreciation of the biochemical underpinnings of this disease will be realized and that clarity and a strong rationale for why basic biochemical research is so important will ensue."
