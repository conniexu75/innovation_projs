https://openalex.org/W2067981471,"IN the course of our work on the chemistry of the constituents of the cell nucleus, nucleoprotein has been extracted from cell nuclei of normal and tumour tissue and fractionated into three main components: nucleic acid, the basic ‘histone’ protein and an acid-insoluble protein residue1. Quantitative amino-acid analyses are being carried out on these fractions. It was thought that the results obtained for calf thymus histone would be of value, since the results hitherto available account for only 50 per cent of the total composition2."
https://openalex.org/W2027506744,"WITH a recording microspectrophotometer of special construction, the absorption spectrum of a bundle of twenty to forty roots of wheat shows distinct bands of cytochrome c (Fig. 1). The bands of the cytochromes b and a + a3 are also recognized as elevations of the curve. The spectrum is calculated as the relation between the transparency of the roots in distilled water and the transparency after shifting over the medium to 0.001 M hydrogen cyanide, the cytochromes being partly in the oxidized state in the untreated roots. The reduction in hydrogen cyanide is due to the blocking of the cytochrome oxidase at still operating dehydro-genases. With carbon monoxide a broadening of the γ-band of cytochrome b is observed. Calculated from the absorption at λ 550 mµ the roots contain approximately 4 mgm. cytochrome c per kgm. fresh weight. The cytochrome system is present at all lengths of the roots of two–three weeks old seedlings. Also single roots of maize show similar spectra."

At ionic strength 0.40 and pH 7.4, it moves more slowly than β-myosin."

https://openalex.org/W2037119064,"RECENT physiological studies on nutrition and growth have shown that leaf area is a reliable index of growth factors determining dry matter accumulation, carbohydrate metabolism, yield and quality of crops1–9,12. Various methods have therefore been devised for measuring the total leaf surface on a growing plant. Of these, mention may particularly be made of : (1) methods based on tracing individual leaves and determining their respective area by planimeter; (2) use of sensitized photopapers, (3) photo-electric devices of various types, (4) adoption of cardboards of known area approximating to the area of different type leaves, and lastly (5) use of mathematical formulæ based on certain leaf measurements. The utility of one or the other of these methods has been stressed by different investigators."

https://openalex.org/W2044535613,"IN two recent publications1,2 on the cytogenetics of “Polypodium vulgare” the situation in Europe has been made fairly clear. There are three distinct species (perhaps ecospecies), one of which, the hexaploid, is probably of local origin and compounded of the other two, which are diploid and tetraploid respectively. The tetraploid, which covers northern Europe, is not closely related to the diploid, which has a more restricted and southerly range, and its origin must probably be looked for farther east, perhaps in Asia, in some birthplace or refuge area from which it has spread over the heavily glaciated countries of northern and central Europe."

https://openalex.org/W2018805289,"A RELATIONSHIP between folic acid and certain constituents of nucleic acids in micro-organisms has been known for some time1. This has been ascertained more directly by the recent demonstration2 that partial deficiency of folic acid in a medium otherwise favourable for rapid growth of Lactobacillus casei results in impairment of the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid but not of ribonucleic acid. According to Stokes3, folic acid may function in an enzyme system responsible for the synthesis of thymine, which in turn is used for forming nucleic acids. Presumably, this takes place through its deoxyriboside thymidine with involvement of vitamin B124, the mediation of which in nucleic acid synthesis has also been shown5. This and other functional relationships between folic acid and vitamin B126 suggested an investigation of their effects, singly and together, on nucleic acid metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1986859945,"DURING the recrystallization of pepsin by the method of Northrop1, which involves heating a solution of the enzyme to 45° C. at pH 4, followed by cooling, it was noticed that the warm solution deposited a considerable quantity of needle crystals totally different from crystalline pepsin; these were identified as tyrosine. Continued autolysis under these conditions yielded 35 mgm. of tyrosine in 24 hr. from 6 c.c. of a solution containing 1.0 gm. of dry pepsin. This represents approximately 40 per cent of the total tyrosine present. Investigation of the dialysed mother liquor by two-dimensional paper chromatography2,3 revealed the presence of at least thirty-four ninhydrin-positive substances (see diagram), many of which disappeared on acid hydrolysis, indicating that they are peptides. It is suspected that some of the spots are simple amino-acids, as indicated by their position and speed of development. Samples of the autolysing solution taken at 5-min. intervals during the first hour showed on paper chromatography with butanol acetic acid in one dimension that a very complex pattern of spots is present from the beginning, though extremely faint at first. Analysis in one dimension could not, of course, decide whether the initial pattern contains all the thirty-four spots finally detected; but it is provisionally concluded that the formation of the final fragments are not rate-determining steps."

https://openalex.org/W2043363374,"DURING infection of mice with influenza virus, the haemagglutinin inhibitor, normally present in their respiratory mucus, disappears1—presumably due to degradation by the enzyme of the multiplying virus2. Human nasal secretions contain a similar substance which, when acted upon in vitro by influenza virus enzyme, loses its inhibitory capacity. As the disappearance of inhibitor was shown to be one of the most sensitive diagnostic signs of influenza in mice3, it seemed promising to apply the same method to the human disease. The recent epidemic of influenza A in Melbourne offered an opportunity of testing this proposition."
https://openalex.org/W2069328454,"DURING a comparative study of the osteology of some Egyptian geckos, including Stenodactylus stenodactylus, Tropiocolotes tripolitanus, T. steudneri, Ptyodactylus hasselquistii, Hemidactylus turcica, Tarentola mauritanica and T. annularis, a rather interesting detail concerning the caudal region of the vertebral column was observed, which has not previously been recorded in living Lacertilia, so far as we are aware. It concerns the presence of caudal ribs in geckos. Among the above-mentioned species, such ribs were found in both Tarentola annularis and Ptyodactylus hasselquistii."

https://openalex.org/W2043721041,"DURING a recent investigation at the University Botany School, Cambridge, of the association of ciliate protozoa and bacteria in a chalk stream, Styl nichia mytilus in common with other ciliate protozoa exhibited a series of ‘pulses’, or maximum waves when it spread down the stream, and minimum phases when it could be found only in the upper reaches. Forms in binary fission or conjugation were sometimes noted at the end of the maximum phase, whereas the minimum phase was generally marked by the appearance of small forms. The pulse of Stylonichia could not be related to any constant climatic or physical factor (rainfall, pH, temperature, etc.) or to total bacterial numbers at 22° C. or any particular group of bacteria. However, the maximum phase often occurred about a week to ten days after one of the lunar periods. From May to December 1947, the maximum phases occurred on twelve out of thirteen occasions a week to ten days after a new moon or a full moon: the greatest maximum peak was attained nine days after a new moon in July and four days after a full moon in December. By contrast with the dry weather and clear nights of 1947, the year 1948 was wet and dull. Stylonichia was only recorded between May and September, yet on five occasions it reached its maximum phase on an average eight days after a new or a full moon."

Antihistamines were too toxic, and so they could not demonstrate convincingly that their effect was similar to that of histamine desensitization."

https://openalex.org/W2040457014,"THROUGH the courtesy of Dr. B. Kullenberg, who is in charge of the study of the sediment cores from the Indian Ocean taken by him with the aid of his revolutionary sampler during the Swedish Deep-Sea Expedition, I have been able to examine several of the cores from that Ocean for microfossils. These investigations have been mainly restricted to the Radiolaria, and on this subject there is considerable disparity between our results and those of the John Murray Expedition to the same area. As this lack of agreement involves the matter of the technique of investigation of the biological components of deepsea sediments, it is considered advisable to publish a short notice before the appearance of the complete reports of the Expedition."

https://openalex.org/W2009216026,"A SHORT well-defined streak at right angles to the direction of the fibre axis is seen on both sides of the lead beam-trap on X-ray photographs of natural cellulosic fibres taken under suitable conditions. Kratky1 and Kratky and Porod2 consider that this low-angle X-ray scattering can be attributed to the close-packing of crystallites, and this hypothesis is corroborated by work of Heyn3,4. In the course of a study of the structure of jute and other fibres, I have repeated some of Heyn's experiments, and have also examined the effect produced by removal of lignin upon the intermicellar swelling of jute fibre in water."
https://openalex.org/W2024073285,"THE occurrence of a trypanosome as a parasite in a triatoma has hitherto escaped notice in India. In 1909 Donovan, however, reported the presence of crithidia in the intestines of Triatoma rubrofasciatus in Madras. Triatoma rubrofasciatus, the common Indian cone-nosed bug, is found almost exclusively in and near human habitations. It is usually active at night, frequently feeding on human blood."

https://openalex.org/W2089458081,"THE usual reaction product of the treatment of the acylated nitriles of aldonic acids with ammonia are the aldose diacetamides1. A variation of this reaction was found when Hockett and Chandler2, by treating hexa-acetyl-D-α-glucoheptonic acid nitrile with ammonia, obtained N-acetyl-D-glucofuranosylamine. The same product resulted from the action of ammonia on penta-acetyl-aldehydo-D-glucose. Later, Niemann and Hays3 prepared N-acetyl-D-glucofuranosylamine by the action of methanolic ammonia on penta-acetyl-D-β-glucose, a reaction that produced the transformation of the original pyranose ring of the acetylated glucose into a furanose structure."
