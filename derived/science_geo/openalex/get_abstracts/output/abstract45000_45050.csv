https://openalex.org/W1998531275,"Class II major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules have an immunoregulatory role. These cell-surface glycoproteins present fragments of protein antigens (or peptides) to thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells). Nucleotide sequence polymorphism in the genes that encode the class II MHC products determines the specificity of the immune response and is correlated with the development of autoimmune diseases. This study identifies certain class II polymorphic amino acid residues that are strongly associated with susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pemphigus vulgaris. These findings implicate particular class II MHC isotypes in susceptibility to each disease and suggest new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1973592220,"Expression of the human transferrin receptor (hTR) and its mRNA is strongly induced by iron deprivation. By measuring transcription elongation rates, levels of hTR-specific nuclear RNA, and mRNA half-lives, we found this regulation to occur posttranscriptionally in the cytoplasm. Analysis of hTR cDNA mutants with deletions in the 3′ untranslated region revealed the existence of two distinct domains, both of which are essential for regulation in mouse L cells. The regulated phenotype correlates with the presence of a stem-loop structure predicted by a computer algorithm. Expression of point and deletion mutants affecting the stem-loop confirmed the requirement for this secondary structure in regulation. The 3′ untranslated region of hTR cDNA was sufficient to confer iron-dependent regulation on another gene."
https://openalex.org/W1995499596,"Protein kinase C (PKC)-related cDNA clones encode an 84 kd protein, nPKC. nPKC contains a cysteine-rich repeat sequence homologous to that seen in conventional PKCs (alpha, beta I, beta II, and gamma), which make up a family of 77-78 kd proteins with closely related sequences. nPKC, when expressed in COS cells, confers increased high-affinity phorbol ester receptor activity to intact cells. Antibodies raised against nPKC identified a 90 kd protein in rabbit brain extract as well as in extracts from COS cells transfected with the cDNA construct. nPKC shows protein kinase activity that is regulated by phospholipid, diacylglycerol, and phorbol ester but is independent of Ca2+. The structural and enzymological characteristics of nPKC clearly distinguish it from conventional PKCs, which until now have been the only substances believed to mediate the various effects of diacylglycerol and phorbol esters. These results suggest an additional signaling pathway involving nPKC."
https://openalex.org/W1606315898,"A putative growth hormone receptor from detergent-solubilized rabbit liver membranes and the growth hormone binding protein from rabbit serum have been purified 59,000- and 400,000-fold, respectively, primarily by affinity chromatography. Both purified proteins exhibit high affinity binding for human growth hormone; K alpha = 9-30 x 10(9) M-1 for the liver receptor and K alpha = 6 x 10(9) M-1 for the binding protein. The apparent molecular weight of the liver receptor is 130,000 by reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, while that of the binding protein is 51,000. Both contain N-linked carbohydrate. The amino-terminal sequences of the liver growth hormone receptor and the serum binding protein were found to be the same, indicating that the binding protein corresponds to the extracellular domain of the liver receptor. Ubiquitin was found covalently linked to the liver receptor but not to the serum binding protein. The amino acid sequences of several peptides from the liver receptor were also determined after tryptic and V8 protease digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1558862814,"Numerous investigations suggest that cell surface glycoconjugates, and in particular sialic acids, are directly involved in determining the metastatic phenotype. To further evaluate this hypothesis, we have used a variety of techniques to probe the cell surfaces of several metastatic variants of the murine B16 melanoma that were selected for experimental lung-colonizing ability (Fidler, I. (1973) Nature 242, 148-149) or for their ability to spontaneously metastasize from the site of a subcutaneous injection (Stackpole, C. W., Alterman, A. L., and Fornabaio, D. M. (1985) Invasion & Metastasis 5, 125-142). Using a highly sensitive high performance liquid chromatography sialic acid assay in conjunction with Vibrio cholerae sialidase, we find that none of these metastatic variants differ significantly in their overall levels of cell surface sialic acid. Using highly purified, linkage-specific sialyltransferases, in conjunction with specific glycosidases, to probe the cell surface saccharide topography of specific penultimate oligosaccharides, we also find no significant differences between the efficient lung-colonizing variant, B16-F10 and the poorly-colonizing B16-F1 or B16-Flr variants. In contrast, the spontaneously metastatic variants examined contain substantially different levels of specific penultimate sialylation sites. The tumorigenic but nonmetastatic B16-LM3/G3.26 variant contains 4-fold more penultimate Gal beta 1-3GalNAc sialylation sites than the tumorigenic and highly metastatic B16-LM3/G3.12 variant when CMP[3H]NeuAc and the alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3GalNAc sialyltransferase are used to probe the melanoma cell surfaces. Several prominent glycoconjugates of apparent Mr 43,000, 40,000, and 30,000 are especially evident upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the nonmetastatic cells. The nonmetastatic variant also contains 2-fold more Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc sialylation sites than the metastatic variant when the alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc sialyltransferase is used as a cell surface probe. In this case, glycoconjugates of apparent Mr 74,000, 45,000, and 43,000 are more prominently observed on the cell surfaces of the nonmetastatic variant. These data indicate that the differences in lung-colonizing abilities of B16 melanoma metastatic variants do not correlate with the numbers or sialylation states of specific penultimate oligosaccharide structures on their surfaces. However, the relative levels of specific penultimate saccharide structures do correlate with the ability of the cells to undergo spontaneous metastasis from a subcutaneous tumor."

https://openalex.org/W1651616001,"The biosynthesis and maturation of human sucrase-isomaltase (SI, EC 3.2.1.48-10), was studied in cultured small intestinal biopsy specimens and mucosa explants. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine revealed one high mannose intermediate of Mr = 210,000 (pro-SIh) which was processed at a slow rate to an endo H-resistant, mature form of Mr = 245,000 (pro-SIc). The fully core-glycosylated form (Mr = 212,000) was detected only when 1-deoxynojirimycin was added to the culture medium, thus indicating that the core sugars undergo rapid processing by rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound glycosidases. The data presented showed that trypsin specifically and instantaneously (within 1 min) cleaves pro-SIc to two subunits Ic (Mr = 145,000) and Sc (Mr = 130,000). Elastase and chymotrypsin are not effective. Enzymic and chemical deglycosylations of SI with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) as well as probing for the binding capacity of SI to Helix pomatia lectin demonstrated that pro-SIc, Ic, and Sc are N- and O-glycosylated. Furthermore, the results were indicative of a posttranslational O-glycosylation of pro-SI, since (i) the earliest detectable precursor form, pro-SIh, did not bind to H. pomatia lectin and (ii) its deglycosylation products with both endo-beta-N-acetylglucosamidase H and TFMS were identical. Both the Sc and Ic subunits contain eight N-linked glycan units, at least one of which is of the high mannose type and found on Sc. Finally, Sc, but not Ic, was shown to display at least four populations varying in their content of O-linked glycans. The heterogeneous O-glycosylation pattern of Sc could be correlated with the distal position of this subunit (and its O-glycosylation sites) within the pro-SI molecule, thus affecting the extent of O-linked oligosaccharide processing and their subsequent presentation on the mature molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1498072653,"Abstract Tertiary and quaternary structural changes that occur during post-translational processing of the insulin proreceptor were examined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine, labeled insulin receptor species, isolated by immuno- and insulin-affinity adsorption, were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under conditions where intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds remained intact or were cleaved by reduction. Reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that the insulin receptor is synthesized as a long-lived (t1/2 = 3 h) proreceptor precursor of 210 kDa which undergoes proteolytic cleavage and carbohydrate maturation to form the alpha- and beta-subunits of the mature receptor. The proreceptor acquires insulin binding activity through a subtle structural change (t1/2 = 45 min) detected only by an autoimmune antibody specific for an epitope of the insulin binding site. Analysis of insulin receptor species by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the proreceptor undergoes two additional structural changes not detected by reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proreceptor is synthesized as a monomer (M1) with an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa that is converted by disulfide rearrangement to another monomeric form of 190-kDa apparent molecular mass (M2). N-Linked glycosylation is required for this transition, since aglycoproreceptor, synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin, does not undergo any detectable tertiary or quaternary structural changes. M2 self-associates to form a disulfide-linked proreceptor dimer (D) which is subsequently proteolytically processed, forming the mature, disulfide-linked alpha 2 beta 2 receptor tetramer. The mature receptor was distinguished from the three proreceptor species (M1, M2, and D) by its cell surface location and its ability to bind tightly to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, indicating the presence of complex oligosaccharide chains. Subcellular fractionation indicated that both the M1 to M2 and M2 to D conversions occur in the endoplasmic reticulum. Separation of the nonreduced proreceptor species into active and inactive forms by affinity chromatography on insulin-agarose revealed that neither the transition of M1 to M2, nor of M2 to D, is correlated with the acquisition of insulin binding function. Rather, during its life-time, the M2 species acquires insulin binding activity and an epitope recognized by a binding site specific autoimmune antibody through a subtle structural change not detected by reducing or nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1511361584,"Abstract A cDNA sequence has been used to derive the precursor structure of a highly repetitive protein in Xenopus laevis skin. From the sequence of a whole family of secretory proteins can be predicted containing a classical hydrophobic signal sequence at the NH2-terminal end of the precursor. The proteins contain four domains with high homology to porcine pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide. These four cysteine-rich, presumably physiologically active domains are separated in the molecule by a repetitive element, locating two such domains to the NH2 terminus of the precursor protein and the remaining two to the COOH-terminal end. The separating spacer consists of very unusual, precise, threonine and proline-rich repeats containing 9 residues which could be targets for extensive O-glycosylation. Additionally, processing at two pairs of basic residues is suggested to liberate two polypeptides (spasmolysins) and spasmolysin-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1978292798,"The self-binding properties of a dominant idiotypic antibody (T15) and a minor idiotypic antibody (M603), both specific for phosphorylcholine, were examined as models of self-binding antibodies (autobodies). Observed differences in the self-binding affinity of T15 and M603 relate to variable sequence differences in their respective heavy and light chains. A molecular recognition theory based on the translation of coding and noncoding DNA strands was used to identify complementary amino acid sequences responsible for self-binding. The second hypervariable region of the heavy chain domain, extending into the third framework region, was predicted as the primary self-binding locus. Among peptides synthesized with different variable heavy and light chain regions, a 24-residue peptide spanning the second hypervariable and third framework regions of the heavy chain of T15 was nearly as effective as phosphorylcholine in inhibiting the self-binding complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1480095913,"The switch region of IgA immunoglobulin in mice cloned into a recombinant plasmid contains a supercoil-dependent S1 nuclease hypersensitive site, indicative of a non-B-DNA secondary structure. This site maps to the (AGGAG)28 direct repeat (DR2) of the alpha switch region and appears at a negative superhelical density of greater than 0.02. Studies with P1 nuclease and bromoacetaldehyde indicate that this structure is also present at neutral pH. S1 nuclease sensitivity is retained for the shorter repeat (AGGAG)6GA in a recombinant plasmid but is not seen for the repeat (CTGAG)6, corresponding to the DR1 repeat of the alpha switch region, or in a sequence corresponding to a portion of the consensus sequence which contains a short stretch of alternating pyrine-pyrimidine residues. Fine mapping of the (AGGAG)6GA and flanking sequences with dimethyl sulfate, bromoacetaldehyde, osmium tetroxide, and diethyl pyrocarbonate reveals an asymmetric pattern of modification dependent on both pH and supercoiling. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis at low pH shows the relaxation of 3 superhelical turns on formation of this structure by the (AGGAG)6GA repeat. These results are most consistent with the formation of an intramolecular triple-strand."
https://openalex.org/W1510112285,"From a mutagenized population of wild type Leishmania donovani promastigotes, a clone was isolated in a single step by virtue of its resistance to 1 mM methotrexate, a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. This methotrexate-selected cell line, MTXA5, was cross-resistant to aminopterin but just as sensitive to growth inhibition caused by pyrimethamine, trimethoprim, and cytotoxic purine and pyrimidine analogs. Unlike previously characterized methotrexate-resistant Leishmania (Coderre, J. A., Beverley, S. M., Schimke, R., and Santi, D. V. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 2132-2136), resistance to the antimetabolite was not due to gene amplification or increased dihydrofolate reductase activity. The genetic defect in MTXA5 cells appeared to be in the methotrexate-folate transport system. The rate of uptake and transport of [3H]methotrexate and [3H]folate into MTXA5 cells was less than 1% of that of wild type parental cells. Neither wild type nor MTXA5 cells could multiply in folate-deficient medium, and thymine and thymidine at concentrations which circumvented methotrexate toxicity, did not restore the ability of Leishmania to grow. The concentration of exogenous folate that restored growth of wild type and mutant cells, however, was virtually identical, although MTXA5 cells, unlike parental cells, could not proliferate in folate-deficient medium supplemented with 10 microM biopterin. Interestingly, methotrexate and aminopterin could stimulate the growth of both leishmanial strains in folate-deficient medium, suggesting that these antifolate analogs were serving as a pteridine source for the parasite. These somatic cell genetic studies of folate transport in Leishmania provide genetic evidence for a specific folate permease in L. donovani promastigotes and have important implications concerning the mechanisms by which these parasites utilize exogenous pteridines and folates and by which they might become resistant to parasite-directed chemotherapeutic regimens."
https://openalex.org/W1536511686,"A rapid purification of troponin T from adult hearts of various species has been developed. The purification procedure included 60 degrees C treatment of the high salt extract, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The troponin T purified from the bovine left ventricle contained two isoforms, which differed in both apparent molecular mass and isoelectric point. Both isoforms were able to bind to F-actin filaments only in the presence of tropomyosin. Monoclonal antibody JLT12 against rabbit skeletal troponin T cross-reacted with both isoforms of bovine cardiac troponin T. There was no detectable difference in the relative amount of these two isoforms among different portions (atria, right and left ventricles) of the bovine heart. The purified protein was used as an antigen to immunize mice, and a mouse antiserum with high titer and specificity to both isoforms was subsequently obtained. This antiserum also cross-reacted with cardiac troponin T from chicken, rabbit, and rat. The antibodies were further used to probe cardiac development in rats by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. The results clearly showed that there was a switch of troponin T isoforms between hearts from 20-day-old rat embryos and hearts from 14-day-old rats. Immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from day 5 rat hearts revealed the presence of two isoforms of troponin T, suggesting that two mRNAs coding for these two isoforms existed in the heart cells. It is of interest to not that some profound changes in the morphology and function of cardiac muscle have also been detected at this time of development. Troponin T isoform switching thus may well represent an important marker for cardiac development and function."
https://openalex.org/W1809573767,"Attack by reactive oxygen species leads to a decay in phycoerythrin fluorescence emission. This phenomenon provides a versatile new assay for small molecules and macromolecules that can function as protective compounds. With 1-2 x 10(-8) M phycoerythrin, under conditions where peroxyl radical generation is rate-limiting, the fluorescence decay follows apparent zero-order kinetics. On reaction with HO., generated with the ascorbate-Cu2+ system, the fluorescence decays with apparent first-order kinetics. Examination of the major components of human urine in this assay confirms that at physiological concentrations, urate protects against both types of oxygen radicals. A novel finding is that creatinine protects efficiently by a chelation mechanism against radical damage in the ascorbate-Cu2+ system at creatinine, ascorbate, and Cu2+ concentrations comparable to those in normal urine. Urate and creatinine provide complementary modes of protection against reactive oxygen species in the urinary tract."
https://openalex.org/W1584373876,"Mouse ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) genomic clones were isolated from a bacteriophage lambda genomic library representing mouse myeloma 653-1 cells which over-produce ODC due to amplification of an active ODC gene. Sequence analysis of the amplified ODC gene revealed that ODC mRNA is encoded by 12 exons, 10 of which (exons 3 to 12) code for the ODC protein. Exon 12 also corresponds to the 3' noncoding region of the two species of ODC mRNA which are formed by alternative utilization of two polyadenylation signals separated from each other by 422 nucleotides. The transcription initiation site was mapped by S1 nuclease protection and by primer extension analysis. The 5' flanking region is extremely rich in G + C and contains typical promoter motifs such as the TATA box and SP1 transcription factor binding sites. Joining the 5' flanking region to the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene and its introduction into mouse cells resulted in the expression of a high level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. Comparing the sequence of the ODC gene to our previously published sequence of ODC cDNA revealed a disagreement between the sequences located 5' to the AvaI site and demonstrated that this region of our previously reported cDNA represents a cloning artifact. The portion of the correct 5' noncoding region encoded by exon 1 is extremely rich in G + C and includes potential secondary structures which may be involved in translational regulation of ODC mRNA."

The Drosophila mulleri Adh-1 gene is expressed in the larval fat body and in three other larval tissues. In this paper, we show that Adh-1 expression in multiple cell types is the result of synergistic interactions between fat body-specific enhancers and a specific Adh-1 promoter element."
https://openalex.org/W1550721230,"2-5A-dependent RNase (RNase L, RNase F) is an enzyme which mediates effects of 2-5A (px(A2'p)nA; x = 2 or 3, n greater than or equal to 2) in cells. 2-5A binding activity present in mouse liver extracts was measured using a 32P-labeled 2-5A derivative. Analysis of Scatchard plots was consistent with a single noninteracting 2-5A binding site with a Ka of 2.5 X 10(10) M-1. Similarly, affinity labeling of proteins with a 32P-labeled 2-5A derivative revealed a single, high-affinity 2-5A-binding protein of Mr 80,000. This 2-5A-binding protein was the only mouse liver protein specifically and consistently eluted by 2-5A from an affinity resin consisting of core(2-5A) covalently attached to cellulose. The 2-5A-eluted protein could degrade polyuridylic acid but not polycytidylic acid. Furthermore, when the 2-5A-eluted protein was electrophoresed into a polyuridylic acid-containing, nondenaturing gel, a band of degraded polyuridylic acid was demonstrated after incubation with 2-5A. There was no band of degraded polyuridylic acid when the elution was performed either in the absence of oligonucleotide or in the presence of low amounts of a closely related analog of 2-5A, p3I2'pA2'pA. Therefore, the Mr 80,000 2-5A-binding protein and the 2-5A-dependent RNase were almost certainly the same protein. Finally, the Mr 80,000 2-5A-binding protein was purified to homogeneity by electroelution from a polyacrylamide gel."
https://openalex.org/W1504165580,"As an initial step in studies aimed at addressing the question of what common and unique features of the S100 family of proteins are related to their specific functions and localizations, a gene coding for one of the S100 proteins, S100 beta, has been prepared by ligation of 12 overlapping, synthetic oligonucleotides. Automated DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the final construct has the expected structure. The gene was inserted into a plasmid vector that contains a tac promoter and ampicillin-resistance gene, thus allowing both amplification and direct expression cloning in Escherichia coli. The gene was designed to allow rapid, efficient changes of single or multiple amino acids by using cassette-based mutagenesis while the gene is resident in the vector. The expressed protein (VUSB-1) is indistinguishable from bovine brain S100 beta in terms of electrophoretic mobility, reactivity with antibodies to S100 beta, amino acid composition, and partial amino acid sequence analysis. Preparations of expressed protein are also functionally similar to bovine brain S100 beta as determined by aldolase activator activity and neurite extension factor activity, supporting the concept that these activities are a property of the S100 beta polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1537053060,"Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT; EC 2.1.1.28) catalyzes the synthesis of epinephrine from norepinephrine, the last step of catecholamine biosynthesis. To isolate a cDNA clone for human PNMT, we first isolated a cDNA clone for bovine adrenal medulla PNMT using mixed oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes whose synthesis was based on the partial amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides from the bovine enzyme. By screening a bovine adrenal medulla cDNA library, a cDNA clone with an insert of about 200 base pairs (bp) was isolated. This clone consisted of 84 bp of carboxyl-terminal coding region, which contained amino acid sequences corresponding to two tryptic peptides, and about 100 bp of 3'-untranslated region. Using this cDNA fragment as the probe, we screened a human pheochromocytoma cDNA library and isolated a cDNA clone with an insert of about 1.0 kilobase pairs, which contained the complete coding region of the enzyme. Northern blot analysis of human pheochromocytoma poly(A)+ RNA using this cDNA insert as the probe showed a single RNA species of about 1,000 nucleotides, suggesting that this clone is a full-length cDNA. Determination of the nucleotide sequence revealed that human PNMT consists of 282-amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 30,853, including initial methionine. The amino acid sequence of the human PNMT was highly homologous (88%) to that of the bovine enzyme. Chromosomal assignment of the gene for human PNMT was carried out using mouse-human somatic cell hybrids. The PNMT gene was assigned to chromosome 17."
https://openalex.org/W1594629478,"We previously described and partially characterized endogenous ligands for nuclear type II sites in normal and malignant tissues. Chromatography of these ligands on Sephadex LH-20 revealed that two peaks with binding activity (alpha and beta) could be resolved. The beta-peak component was present in all normal tissues that we examined, but not in malignant tissues, and it inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in vitro. Conversely, the alpha-peak component was found to be present in both normal and malignant tissues, and did not inhibit MCF-7 cell growth. The present studies describe the purification and identification of the alpha-peak and beta-peak components in bovine serum and an assessment of the effects of these compounds on normal and malignant cell growth. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of the purified beta-peak component demonstrated that the compound was methyl p-hydroxyphenyllactate (MeHPLA). Competition analysis revealed that MeHPLA binds to nuclear type II sites with a high binding affinity, while physiological levels of this compound blocked estradiol stimulation of uterine growth in vivo and inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in vitro. The alpha-peak component was found to be the corresponding acid, p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (HPLA). This compound interacted with nuclear type II sites with a relatively low affinity and did not block uterotropic response to estradiol or inhibit MCF-7 cell growth. These studies demonstrate that HPLA and MeHPLA are ligands for nuclear type II sites and that MeHPLA may be a very important regulator of normal and malignant cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W1541363280,"The exon-intron organization of two rabbit genes that hybridize with cytochrome P-450 3a (P-450ALC) cDNA has been determined by restriction mapping and sequence analysis. Gene 1 encodes cytochrome P-450 3a as judged by the complete identity of its coding nucleotide sequence with P-450 3a cDNA. Gene 2 encodes a previously uncharacterized cytochrome P-450 that is 97% identical in primary structure to P-450 3a, with 16 amino acid differences scattered throughout the protein. Genes 1 and 2, which are 10 and 9 kilobases in length, respectively, are comprised of 9 exons with exon-intron junctions occurring at identical positions along the mRNA sequences. Each gene contains two transcription start sites approximately 27 and 33 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation codon, as determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments. The predicted lengths of gene 1 and 2 transcripts from the first transcription start site to the poly(A) attachment site are 1999 and 1660 nucleotides, respectively. This difference in size is primarily the result of a 338-base pair deletion in the 3' nontranslated portion of the gene 2 transcript relative to that of gene 1. The two genes show considerable similarity in their 5' flanking regions, including a TATAA transcriptional promoter element at position -28. However, a 32-base pair element that is repeated in gene 1 is present only as a single inexact copy in gene 2. By use of synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes, gene 2 transcripts were shown to be present in poly(A)+ RNA from untreated rabbit liver at approximately 50% of P-450 3a mRNA levels. In kidney, however, no gene 2 mRNA was detected although 3a mRNA was present at approximately 10% of the level in liver."

https://openalex.org/W1040163121,"Membrane-associated peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) activity was investigated in rat anterior and neurointermediate pituitary tissues and in pituitary AtT-20/D-16v and GH3 cell lines. A substantial fraction of total pituitary PAM activity was found to be membrane-associated. Triton X-100, N-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and Zwittergent were effective in solubilizing PAM activity from crude pituitary membranes. The distribution of enzyme activity between soluble and membrane-associated forms was tissue-specific. In the anterior pituitary lobe and pituitary cell lines, 40-60% of total PAM activity was membrane-associated while only 10% of the alpha-amidating activity in the neurointermediate lobe was membrane-associated. Soluble and membrane-associated forms of PAM shared nearly identical characteristics with respect to copper and ascorbate requirements, pH optima, and Km values. Upon subcellular fractionation of anterior and neurointermediate pituitary lobe homogenates on Percoll gradients, 12-18% of total PAM activity was found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi fractions and 42-60% was localized to secretory granule fractions. For both tissues, membrane-associated PAM activity was enriched in the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pool, whereas most of the secretory granule-associated enzyme activity was soluble."
https://openalex.org/W186853567,"We have identified an infant with the perinatal lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta (type II) whose cells synthesize in equal amounts two different pro alpha 1(I) chains of type I procollagen: one chain is normal in length, the other contains an insertion of approximately 50-70 amino acid residues within the triple helical domain defined by amino acids 123-220. The structure of the insertion is consistent with duplication of an approximately 600-base pair segment in one allele of the alpha 1(I) gene (COL1A1). These cells synthesize normal type I procollagen molecules as well as molecules that contain one or two mutant chains. Unlike type I procollagen molecules synthesized by cells from most other infants with osteogenesis imperfecta type II which contain increased lysyl hydroxylation and hydroxylysyl glycosylation along the triple helical domain, the abnormal molecules synthesized by these cells are not overmodified. The lethal effect of this mutation may result from secretion of about one-quarter the normal amount of normal type I procollagen and secretion of a large amount of a molecule which has a lowered melting temperature, is extended asymmetrically, and which has altered structure in domains important for cross-link formation and bone mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W1489823528,"The interaction of several reovirus mRNAs with cap-binding initiation factors has been investigated. Two quantitative experimental techniques have been applied to this question: (a) the rates of reaction of different mRNAs with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase and (b) the extent of cross-linking of different mRNAs to initiation factors in the presence and absence of ATP. The effects of ionic strength on these reactions have also been investigated. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the purified initiation factors interact differentially with purified reovirus mRNAs under competitive conditions and thus confirm earlier interpretations based on kinetic data. Comparison of the data from these studies with the translational behavior of the reovirus mRNAs, both in vitro and in vivo, has also led to specific predictions about features of these mRNAs that determine their competitive efficiencies. 1) Under ordinary ionic conditions, the steric accessibility of the m7G cap moiety of a reovirus mRNA appears to be a major determinant of its translation rate. 2) When the ionic strength is increased to supranormal levels, an additional feature, which may simply be the amount of secondary structure formed by sequences proximal to the cap, can become rate-limiting for several, but not all, of these mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1564985177,"The folate compound 10-formyldihydrofolate (H2folate) has not been found as a component of intracellular folates in normal tissues but has been identified in the cytosol of methotrexate (MTX)-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells and normal human myeloid precursor cells. Its identity was verified by coelution of this compound with a synthetic marker on high pressure liquid chromatography, its reduction to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (H4folate) in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase, and its enzymatic deformylation to dihydrofolate in the presence of aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase. Chemically synthesized monoglutamated or pentaglutamated 10-formyl-H2folate was examined for its interaction with three folate-dependent enzymes: AICAR transformylase, glucinamide ribotide (GAR) transformylase, and thymidylatesynthase. 10-Formyl-H2folate-Glu5 was a competitive inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (Ki = 0.16 microM with 5,10-methylene-H4folate-Glu1 as substrate and 1.6 microM with 5,10-methylene-H4folate-Glu5) and inhibited GAR transformylase (Ki = 2.0 microM). It acted as a substrate for AICAR transformylase (Km = 5.3 microM), and its efficiency was equal to that of the natural substrate 10-formyl-H4folate-Glu5. The inhibition of thymidylate synthase by 10-formyl-H2folate was highly dependent on the inhibitor's polyglutamation state, the -Glu5 derivative having a 52-85-fold greater affinity as compared to the affinity of -Glu1. Polyglutamation of 10-formyl-H2folate did not affect its inhibition of GAR transformylase. While the actual role of 10-formyl-H2folate contributing to the cytotoxicity of MTX has not been determined, this compound has the potential to enhance inhibition of GAR transformylase and thymidylate synthase, and at the same time provides additional substrate for AICAR transformylase. The MTX-induced intracellular accumulation of 10-formyl-H2folate and H2folate may play a role in the drug-related cytotoxicity through the contribution of these folates to the inhibition of thymidylate synthase and de novo purine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1485282100,"Binding of exogenous DNA to the nuclear scaffold was investigated using a plasmid DNA (pBR322, EcoRI site deleted) of various topological forms and nuclear subfractions with different levels of nuclear DNA depletion. When supercoiled DNA was incubated with histone-depleted nuclei (nuclear halo), a dose-dependent binding of the DNA occurred, whereas no binding was observed with relaxed and linear forms of DNA. The bound DNA was released upon linearization with BamHI or digestion of the scaffolding structure with proteinase K. Extensive digestion of the halo with micrococcal nuclease generated additional sites which bind both relaxed and linear DNA. In the presence of a large excess of calf thymus DNA, these sites were effectively blocked and the specificity to supercoiled DNA was restored. The binding of all forms of DNA was abolished by heat-denatured DNA. There was no detectable change in linking number of the scaffold-associated supercoils. Competitive binding was observed between supercoiled DNAs with unrelated sequences, indicating that no specific nucleotide sequence is required for the binding. RNA was found to be a weak competitor. A DNA binding assay performed on electrophoretic blots of solubilized nuclear scaffold revealed a protein component with apparent molecular weight of 120,000 which retained selective binding to supercoils. These results suggest that the nuclear scaffold possesses DNA-binding sites for torsionally strained domains of chromatin and that an integral protein factor is involved in the binding. Implications of the findings are discussed in connection with proposed functions of the nuclear scaffold and topoisomerase II."

https://openalex.org/W1597974861,"The human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is shown to carry out efficient receptor-mediated endocytosis in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Microinjection of mRNAs encoding the human receptor led to synthesis of a 120-kDa precursor possessing high mannose N-linked sugars and core O-linked sugars. During its transport to the cell surface, the protein increased in apparent size to 160 kDa, which is similar to the change that occurs in human cells. This increase was not seen when the receptor lacked the serine/threonine-rich region that undergoes O-linked glycosylation. The surface receptors bound 125I-LDL at 0 degrees C and internalized it with a half-time of 2 min when the cells were warmed to 19 degrees C. The rate of internalization was slowed by 7-fold when a single residue in the cytoplasmic domain (Tyr807) was changed to a cysteine, an alteration that slows incorporation into coated pits in mammalian cells. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain abolished rapid internalization. We conclude that the signals for O-linked glycosylation and receptor-mediated endocytosis of the LDL receptor have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2140654138,"An endo-beta-glucuronidase acting on chondroitin sulfate was isolated from rabbit liver and purified about 550-fold, using a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300, affinity chromatography through heparin-Sepharose CL-6B and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pH optimum of this enzyme was 4.0 and the Km value 7 X 10(-3) M for chondroitin sulfate (Mr 40,000). The isoelectric point of the enzyme was found to be at pH 5.4. The molecular weight, estimated by gel filtration through Sephacryl S-200 and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was 35,000. This enzyme, which was found in the liver, kidney, spleen, and lung, hydrolyzed the glucuronyl galactose linkage of the linkage region of chondroitin sulfate possessing a very small peptide segment. The enzyme did not hydrolyze proteoglycan. It was concluded that an endo-beta-glucuronidase is involved in the catabolism of proteoglycan chondroitin sulfates."
https://openalex.org/W1524991795,"The transferrin receptor undergoes extensive co- and post-translational modifications during its biosynthesis. In this study, the functional and structural properties of the transferrin receptor from tunicamycin-treated A431 cells were examined. Incubation of A431 cells with this inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation results in a shift of the apparent molecular weight of the transferrin receptor from 94,000 to 79,000. The electrophoretic mobility of the receptor from treated cells is that of a monomer under nonreducing conditions, whereas the transferrin receptor in untreated cells has the mobility of a dimer under identical conditions. This result indicates a lack of disulfide bond formation between subunits of the receptor from tunicamycin-treated cells. In solution no dimers can be detected with cross-linking studies. This unglycosylated receptor does not appear to stably bind transferrin as demonstrated by a lack of isolation of this form of the receptor with transferrin-linked Sepharose. It is not transported to the surface of A431 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1578941405,"The mRNA coding for the rat liver S14 protein (Mr 17,000, pI 4.9) shows profound increases during postnatal development. In an effort to define the molecular basis for the postnatal rise in mRNAs14 we examined the chromatin organization of the S14 gene, its DNA methylation state, the hepatic expression of mRNAs14, and the in vitro S14 run-on activity prior to and after weaning at 21 days postpartum. In animals less than or equal to 15 days of age, the hepatic S14 gene is transcriptionally inactive, mRNAs14 levels are less than or equal to 0.5% of adult levels, and the chromatin organization within 11 kilobases of the 5' end of the S14 gene is similar to that found in tissues not expressing mRNAs14. From 18 to 22 days postpartum, the transcriptional activity of the S14 gene increases greater than or equal to 40-fold and mRNAs14 increases greater than or equal to 100-fold approaching adult levels of expression. Highly specific changes in S14 chromatin structure accompany gene activation. The formation of Hss-1 near the S14 cap site (-65 to -265 base pairs) and Hss-3 -3.3 kilobases upstream from the S14 cap site suggests that changes in DNA-protein interaction at these sites may function in both the tissue-specific and developmental regulation of S14 gene expression. The methylation studies suggest HhaI sites may be a cue for the tissue-specific expression of S14. However, the maintenance of hypermethylated HpaII sites throughout S14 gene activation argues against a role for these sites in either the tissue-specific or developmental regulation of S14 gene expression. These studies show that the principal molecular mechanism accounting for the major rise in mRNAs14 during postnatal development is activation of gene transcription and not stabilization of S14 RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1502439966,"We used 2 GHz harmonic content frequency-domain fluorescence to measure the intensity and the anisotropy decays from the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from human hemoglobin (Hb). The tryptophan intensity decays are dominated by a short-lived component which accounts for 35-60% of the total steady state intensity. The decay time of this short component varies from 9 to 27 ps and this component is sensitive to the ligation state of Hb. Our error analyses indicate the uncertainty is about +/- 3 ps. The intensity decays also show two longer lived components near 0.7 and 8 ns, which are probably due either to impurities or to Hb molecules in conformations which do not permit energy transfer. The anisotropy decays indicate the tryptophan residues in Hb are highly mobile, with apparent correlation times near 55 ps."
https://openalex.org/W129423254,"Oligosaccharyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the co-translational transfer of oligosaccharide from dolichyl-PP-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 to -Asn-X-Ser/Thr- sequences in nascent polypeptide chains, was studied in hen oviduct microsomes using the active site-directed photoaffinity probe 125I-labeled N alpha-3-(4-hydroxyphenylpropionyl)-Asn-Lys(N epsilon-p-azidobenzoyl)-Thr-NH2. Several lines of evidence established that the tripeptide probe interacted with a 57-kDa protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that was subsequently glycosylated and converted to a 60-kDa form. The 57-kDa protein, isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, was used as immunogen to prepare polyclonal antisera. The specificity of the antibody was established on the basis of its ability to 1) recognize the 57-kDa protein by immunoblotting and 2) immunoprecipitate the photolabeled protein. The antibody also recognized photolabeled protein from different tissues and organisms. The 57-kDa protein isolated by immunoprecipitation retained its ability to interact with the photoaffinity probe but was inactive in catalyzing glycosylation of peptides. This result suggests that the 57-kDa protein is the component of oligosaccharyltransferase that recognizes the glycosylation site in polypeptides. These results are discussed in terms of possible models for the structure of oligosaccharyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1573790623,"The microsomal fraction of homogenates of seminal vesicles of men and monkeys, Macaca fascicularis, were analyzed for prostaglandin (PG) 19-hydroxylase activity. The microsomes of the monkey seminal vesicles, supplemented with 1 mM NADPH, metabolized 0.2 mM PGE1 to 19-hydroxy-PGE1 at a mean rate of 0.26 nmol/min/mg of protein (with an apparent Km and an apparent Vmax of 40 microM and 0.30 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively). The enzyme catalyzed the incorporation of atmospheric oxygen into the substrate. Substituting NADH for NADPH reduced the prostaglandin E1 19-hydroxylase activity to 40%. Carbon monoxide and proadifen (SKF 525A) inhibited the enzyme. Prostaglandin E2 (0.2 mM) was metabolized to 19-hydroxyprostaglandin E2 (0.2 nmol/min/mg of protein), but PGE1 was preferred as a substrate. Prostaglandin B1 was metabolized to 18-hydroxy-, 19-hydroxy-, and 20-hydroxyprostaglandin B1 at a combined rate of approximately 25% of prostaglandin E1. 19-Hydroxyprostaglandin B1 was the main product. The microsomes of human seminal vesicles metabolized 0.2 mM PGE2 to 19-hydroxy-PGE2 in the presence of 1 mM NADPH, while carbon monoxide inhibited this reaction. These results suggest that prostaglandin 19-hydroxylase of seminal vesicles might be a cytochrome P-450. The biosynthesis of 19-hydroxyprostaglandin E1 and 19-hydroxyprostaglandin E2 was also studied in vivo in man by analysis of the product/substrate ratios (i.e. 19-hydroxyprostaglandin E1/prostaglandin E1 and 19-hydroxyprostaglandin E2/prostaglandin E2) in a series of consecutive ejaculates, which were obtained during short intervals. There was a 10-fold interindividual difference in these ratios. Although the product/substrate ratios decreased, the 19-hydroxylation of E prostaglandins appeared to be efficient in vivo, which was in contrast to the rather slow biosynthesis in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1509351439,"Effective repair of a vascular injury depends on establishment of a stable fibrin patch at the injury site. Data presented in this study demonstrate that structural modification of fibrin occurs as a result of fibrin interaction with naturally occurring components of the vascular basement membrane and subendothelial structures. Of the basement membrane components, type IV collagen produces the greatest structural modification, generating thick fibrin fibers; a 3-fold increase in the fiber mass/length ratio occurs when type IV collagen is increased from 0 to 100 ng/ml. Laminin and dermatan sulfate decrease the fibrin fiber mass/length ratio resulting in thinner fibers. However, the overall effect of the basement membrane on fibrin is to increase the fibrin fiber diameter. Electrophoretic light scattering and the binding of type IV collagen by fibrinogen-Sepharose further establish the interaction between type IV collagen and fibrinogen. Incorporation of laminin with type IV collagen onto coated surfaces decreases the ability of type IV collagen to bind fibrinogen. These studies emphasize that the final fibrin structure is influenced by the milieu in which the clot is assembled."

https://openalex.org/W1482886814,"The cell surface proteoglycan of mouse mammary epithelial (NMuMG) cells behaves as a receptor for interstitial matrix materials and consists of a membrane-associated domain and an extracellular domain (ectodomain). The ectodomain can be released intact from the cell surface by mild trypsin treatment and appears to be shed from the cells into the culture medium by cleavage from the membrane-associated domain. We have examined the chemical relationship between the trypsin-released proteoglycan and shed proteoglycan to assess their relationship to each other and to the cell surface. Purification and amino acid sequencing of the ectodomain released by mild trypsin treatment resulted in no clear signal until the protein was cleaved by CNBr treatment, suggesting that its N terminus is blocked and oriented extracellularly. The amino acid sequence identified in the trypsin-released ectodomain is present near the N terminus of the shed proteoglycan purified from conditioned medium, indicating that both forms possess closely related (if not identical) core proteins. The sequence reveals a pentapeptide identical to one near the C terminus of the rat hepatic lectin (RHL-1, rat asialoglycoprotein receptor). The medium proteoglycan, which migrates as a smear on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (between 93 and 200 kDa), is heterogeneous due to varying amounts of glycosaminoglycan and substituted O-linked oligosaccharide present on an approximately 46-kDa polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1486113404,"Sulfation of fibrinogen was studied in a primary culture of rat hepatocytes. After cells were incubated with [35S]sulfate, 35S-labeled fibrinogen was obtained from the medium by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/fluorography. It was demonstrated that [35S]sulfate is exclusively incorporated into the gamma B chain, which is a minor variant form found in rat fibrinogen, in addition to a major gamma A chain. When the purified 35S-gamma B chain was digested with carboxypeptidase Y, the radioactivity was almost completely released from the protein, and the labeled product released was identified as tyrosine O-sulfate. Based on the available primary structure of the gamma B chain, the results suggest that sulfation occurs on the tyrosine residue at the second position from its COOH terminus. Pulse-chase experiments using both [3H]leucine and [35S]sulfate showed that 35S-labeled fibrinogen is secreted into the medium much faster than the 3H-labeled molecule. Incubation of cells with monensin, an inhibitor of Golgi function, strongly inhibited the sulfation of fibrinogen. In addition, in vitro sulfation experiments demonstrated that sulfotransferase activity is localized in the Golgi fraction. These results indicate that the sulfation of fibrinogen takes place in the Golgi complex, especially in the trans Golgi region, just before its secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1547492708,"Chondrocytes from immature and mature rabbits have been compared in biosynthetic studies with [3H] leucine and [35S]sulfate as precursors. The time course of incorporation of [3H]leucine into general protein, proteoglycan monomer core protein, and link protein and of [35S]sulfate into proteoglycan monomer has been examined. Proteoglycan monomer was isolated from the high buoyant density (p greater than 1.60) fractions of dissociative CsCl gradients and link protein by immunoprecipitation with antibody 8A4 followed by gel electrophoresis. Results based on the period of linear isotope incorporation showed that mature cells synthesize protein at about 40% of the rate of immature cells and both proteoglycan and link protein at about 20% of the rate of immature cells. The labeling rates obtained suggest that immature cells synthesize an approximate 1:1 molar ratio of link protein to proteoglycan monomer, and for mature cells this ratio is about 0.8:1. While cell layer retention of newly synthesized proteoglycan was markedly lower in mature relative to immature cell cultures, link protein retention was high in both immature and mature cultures; this finding provides an explanation for our previous observation (Plaas, A. H. K., and Sandy, J. D. (1984) Biochem, J. 220, 337-340) that link-free monomer accumulates in the medium of mature but not immature cultures. The link protein synthesized by both ages of cells and isolated from cell layer or medium was a single major species of apparent molecular mass 48-51 kDa. The results suggest that mature chondrocytes are less efficient than immature chondrocytes in the coordinated assembly of link-stabilized proteoglycan aggregates in this culture system."
https://openalex.org/W1525237059,"The reduction of flavin in hepatic NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase by the hydrated electron (eaq-) was investigated by pulse radiolysis. The eaq- reduced the flavin of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase to form the red semiquinone between pH 5 and 9. The spectrum of the red semiquinone differs from that of enzyme reduced by dithionite in the presence of NAD+. After the first phase of the reduction, conversion of the red to blue semiquinone was observed at acidic pH. Resulting products are the blue (neutral) or red (anionic) semiquinone or a mixture of the two forms. The pK value for this flavin radical was approximately 6.3. Subsequently, the semiquinone form reacted by dismutation to form the oxidized and the fully reduced forms of the enzyme with a rate constant of 1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1 at pH 7.1. In the presence of NAD+, eaq- reacted with NAD+ to yield NAD(.). Subsequently, NAD. transferred an electron to NAD+-bound oxidized enzyme to form the blue and red semiquinone or mixture of the two forms of the enzyme, where pK value of this flavin radical was approximately 6.3. The blue semiquinone obtained at acidic pH was found to convert to the red semiquinone with a first order rate constant of 90 s-1, where the rates were not affected by pH or the concentration of NAD+. The final product is NAD+-bound red semiquinone of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W63265575,"The effect of side chain modification on the organic anion exchanger in the renal brush-border membrane was examined to identify what amino acid residues constitute the substrate binding site. One histidyl-specific reagent, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), and 2 arginyl-specific reagents, phenylglyoxal and 2,3-butanedione, were tested for their effect on the specifically mediated transport of p-amino[3H]hippurate (PAH), a prototypic organic anion. The specifically mediated transport refers to the difference in the uptake of [3H]PAH in the absence and presence of a known competitive inhibitor, probenecid, and was examined in brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from the outer cortex of canine kidneys. The experiments were performed utilizing a rapid filtration assay. DEPC, phenylglyoxal, and 2,3-butanedione inactivated the specifically mediated PAH transport, i.e. probenecid inhibitable transport with IC50 values of 160, 710, and 1780 microM, respectively. The rates of PAH inactivation by DEPC and phenylglyoxal were suggestive of multiple pseudo first-order reaction kinetics and were consistent with a reaction mechanism whereby more than 1 arginyl or histidyl residue is inactivated. Furthermore, PAH (5 mM) did not affect the rate of phenylglyoxal inactivation. In contrast, PAH (5 mM) affected the rate of DEPC inactivation. The modification by DEPC was specific for histidyl residues since transport could be restored by treatment with hydroxylamine. The results demonstrate that histidyl and arginyl residues are essential for organic anion transport in brush-border membrane vesicles. We conclude that the histidyl residue constitutes the cationic binding site for the anionic substrate, whereas the arginyl residue(s) serves to guide the substrate to or away from the histidyl site."
https://openalex.org/W1507346818,"In this study a synthetic analog of the calmodulin-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase, a 17-amino-acid peptide (M5) was used to examine the possible role of calmodulin in melanotropin receptor function. Binding of beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone to its membrane receptor and subsequent stimulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) were found to be specifically inhibited by M5 in a dose-dependent and noncompetitive manner, both in intact M2R melanoma cells and in a plasma membrane preparation derived thereof. Half-maximal inhibition of both hormone binding and melanotropin-sensitive AC activity was shown to occur at approximately 1 microM M5. In contrast, stimulation of AC by prostaglandin E1, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate, forskolin, and unstimulated enzyme activity were unaffected by the presence of M5, under the same assay conditions. Furthermore, addition of a molar excess of calmodulin to the AC assay completely abolished the inhibitory effects of the peptide on melanotropin-stimulated AC activity. Other peptides of similar size, which bind to calmodulin with low affinity (e.g. glucagon, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide), were shown to be totally ineffective in inhibiting melanotropin-sensitive AC. These findings, along with those shown previously for other antagonists of calmodulin, suggest a role for an M5-binding protein, as of yet unidentified, involved in the regulation of the melanotropin receptor function."

The activity profiles were congener-specific, and they establish the dissociable nature of the various actions that characterize the parent molecule, VBL."
https://openalex.org/W2109163058,"To investigate the possibility that the opioid peptide precursor proenkephalin A was glycosylated, we utilized an antiserum raised against the COOH terminus of Met-enkephalin Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (MERGL) to identify and characterize enkephalin-containing peptides from extracts of bovine adrenal medulla. Sephadex G-50 gel filtration separated two immunoreactive peaks which had apparent masses of 9 and 6 kDa. Anion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed that the 9-kDa material was a heterogenous mixture of immunoreactive peptides, of which one (9K-MERGL Ia) was purified to homogeneity. The 6-kDa material separated into two major immunoreactive peaks (6K-MERGL I and 6K-MERGL II) on anion-exchange chromatography, and these were obtained in an homogenous form after reverse-phase HPLC. Amino acid sequencing, together with immunological characterization, indicated that the three peptides were identical in chain length, and corresponded to proenkephalin A 116-165. They contained the sequence Asn-Ser-Ser which is a potential N-glycosylation site. In 9K-MERGL Ia, but not the others, automated Edman amino acid sequencing was unable to detect the relevant asparagine residue, suggesting that this residue has been chemically modified. Further investigation of the 9K-MERGL material using lectin affinity chromatography provided direct evidence of glycosylation. Verification of this result was obtained using the specific enzyme glycopeptidase F (glycopeptide-N-glycosidase) which demonstrated that 9K-MERGL contained, in part, N-linked oligosaccharide chains. These results show that an NH2 terminally extended Met-enkephalin Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 variant was N-glycosylated, and hence indicate that the precursor polypeptide proenkephalin A can be glycosylated during translation in the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2126446751,"Thromboxane A2 and cysteinyl leukotrienes are highly effective microvessel constrictors in normally perfused myocardium. Their release during acute coronary thrombosis might augment myocardial underperfusion. The constrictor action of these substances could be modified substantially, however, by concomitant myocardial ischemia. We compared the effects of the two eicosanoid constrictors in normally perfused and ischemic myocardium of 24 open-chest, pentobarbital-anesthetized pigs. Left anterior descending coronary flow was measured after intracoronary bolus injections of the stable thromboxane A2 analog U46619 (1-10 micrograms) or leukotriene D4 (LTD4, 1-10 micrograms). Each dose was given before and during myocardial ischemia induced by a snare adjusted to produce 63 +/- 2% decrease in coronary flow for 10 min. Marked dose-independent inhibition of eicosanoid-induced coronary flow decrease occurred during ischemia. With 10 micrograms U46619, coronary flow decrease in the unoccluded state (25 +/- 2 from 55 +/- 4 ml/min pretreatment baseline) was virtually eliminated during snare occlusion (1 +/- 1 from 21 +/- 3 ml/min pretreatment baseline, P less than 0.001). Similar results occurred with LTD4. Distal coronary pressure during ischemia indicated a lack of microvessel responsiveness to the eicosanoids rather than a buffering of resistance change by the snare. U46619 and LTD4 did induce transient, small reductions in regional shortening fraction during ischemia. Our data suggest that eicosanoid-induced constriction of myocardial resistance vessels is not a likely complication of acute coronary thrombosis. However, eicosanoids could depress residual contractility in moderately ischemic regions."

Direct measurement of storage and loss moduli were made using two rheometers of different design. Measurements of the diffusion of G-actin and of tracer particles added to G-actin solutions were carried out using dynamic light scattering and fluorescence photobleaching recovery techniques. Measurements were performed over a period of many hours, on actin solutions prepared under conditions for which anomalous gelation had been reported. All data from this investigation are consistent with the conclusion that dilute G-actin solutions behave as newtonian liquids."
