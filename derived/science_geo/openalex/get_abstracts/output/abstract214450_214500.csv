https://openalex.org/W2018297457,THE modifying effect of oxygen on the biological response to 14-MeV neutrons has been discussed in relation to the use of these neutrons in radiotherapy1–5; but no direct experimental data were cited. We have recently obtained for another purpose some data for 14-MeV neutrons on yields of chromatid-type aberrations in meristematic cells of bean root tips in aerated and anoxic conditions. The dose modification factor for true aberrations was about 1.5 and for non-staining lesions (‘gaps’)6 about 1.3. These values are very little greater than those found for chromosome damage in the same biological material with 3-MeV neutrons7 or in Tradescantia micro-spores with fission neutrons8.

https://openalex.org/W1980129044,"L-CYSTEINE, in common with several other amino-acids, is able to inhibit the uptake of L-histidine by brain slices, but the inhibition which it produces, unlike that produced by the other amino-acids, is non-competitive1. It therefore appeared possible that cysteine might also have an inhibitory action on other transport phenomena. Its effect on the transport system for potassium, as indicated by alteration in the level of potassium in brain slices (normally maintained well above that of a suitable environment2), has therefore been investigated, and compared with the effect of other amino-acids."

https://openalex.org/W2027358455,"DL-Amino-acids as substitutes for L isomers are often used in culture media of the microbial organisms and mammalian cells. The common absence of growth inhibition by using DL-amino-acids in the culture media led to the notion that D isomers are nutritionally inert. While this remains generally true in the sense of the culture of wild-type strain of micro-organisms, it is now apparent in our report that D-amino-acid even in the low concentration of 10−5 M inhibits the growth of the L-isomer-requiring mutant. Although several D-amino-acids have been found to inhibit cell division and growth1–3, the effect of D-tryptophan for cell growth has never been reported except that the high concentration of DL-tryptophan (6.8 × 10−3 M) caused formation of extremely long cells of Erwinia after 16 h incubation and that higher levels of the D-amino-acid resulted in growth inhibition1. This paper presents evidence that D-tryptophan in low concentration (10−5 M) was found to inhibit the growth of an L-tryptophan-requiring mutant of the E. coli, and the inhibition of the active transport is one of the bases of the growth inhibitory action of D-tryptophan on E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W2023747240,"HIGHLY significant changes have been shown in the levels of four members of the citric acid cycle (pyruvate, citrate, α-oxoglutarate and succinate) in the serum of cows suffering from primary ketosis1. It was suggested that there may be interference with the reactions of the citric acid cycle, involving the conversion of pyruvate and α-oxoglutarate to citrate and succinate respectively. Furthermore, it was suggested as a working hypothesis that the cause of such an interference may be a deficiency of a co-factor or co-factors common to both oxidative decarboxylation reactions, such as coenzyme A. During the winter of 1962–63 coenzyme A levels were estimated in the livers of 7 cows suffering from spontaneous primary ketosis and compared with the corresponding levels in the livers of 7 normal cows at the same stage of lactation."
