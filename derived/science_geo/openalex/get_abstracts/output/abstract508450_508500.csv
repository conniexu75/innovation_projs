https://openalex.org/W1964333133,"The structure of the 39S large mitoribosome subunit is solved by cryo-electron microscopy at an impressive 3.4 Å resolution, revealing the location of 50 ribosomal proteins, the peptidyl transferase centre, the tRNAs within this active site, and the nascent peptide chain within the exit tunnel. Mitochondrial ribosomes have a different RNA and protein composition than cytoplasmic ribosomes. Nenad Ban and colleagues have solved the structure of the 39S large mitoribosome subunit by cryo-electon microscopy at high (3.4 Å) resolution. They are able to locate 50 ribosomal proteins, the peptidyl transferase centre, the tRNAs within this active site, and the nascent peptide chain within the exit tunnel. One unanticipated feature of this ribosome subunit is that a mitochondrial tRNA has replaced the 5S ribosomal RNA, which has a structural role in the cytoplasmic large ribosomal subunit. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) are extensively modified ribosomes of bacterial descent specialized for the synthesis and insertion of membrane proteins that are critical for energy conversion and ATP production inside mitochondria1. Mammalian mitoribosomes, which comprise 39S and 28S subunits2, have diverged markedly from the bacterial ribosomes from which they are derived, rendering them unique compared to bacterial, eukaryotic cytosolic and fungal mitochondrial ribosomes3,4,5. We have previously determined at 4.9 Å resolution the architecture of the porcine (Sus scrofa) 39S subunit6, which is highly homologous to the human mitoribosomal large subunit. Here we present the complete atomic structure of the porcine 39S large mitoribosomal subunit determined in the context of a stalled translating mitoribosome at 3.4 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy and chemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry. The structure reveals the locations and the detailed folds of 50 mitoribosomal proteins, shows the highly conserved mitoribosomal peptidyl transferase active site in complex with its substrate transfer RNAs, and defines the path of the nascent chain in mammalian mitoribosomes along their idiosyncratic exit tunnel. Furthermore, we present evidence that a mitochondrial tRNA has become an integral component of the central protuberance of the 39S subunit where it architecturally substitutes for the absence of the 5S ribosomal RNA, a ubiquitous component of all cytoplasmic ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2065467053,"Here we show how a sperm-specific potassium channel (SLO3) controls Ca2+ entry into sperm through a sperm-specific Ca2+ channel, CATSPER, in a totally unanticipated manner. The genetic deletion of either of those channels confers male infertility in mice. During sperm capacitation SLO3 hyperpolarizes the sperm, whereas CATSPER allows Ca2+ entry. These two channels may be functionally connected, but it had not been demonstrated that SLO3-dependent hyperpolarization is required for Ca2+ entry through CATSPER channels, nor has a functional mechanism linking the two channels been shown. In this study we show that Ca2+ entry through CATSPER channels is deficient in Slo3 mutant sperm lacking hyperpolarization; we also present evidence supporting the hypothesis that SLO3 channels activate CATSPER channels indirectly by promoting a rise in intracellular pH through a voltage-dependent mechanism. This mechanism may work through a Na+/H+ exchanger (sNHE) and/or a bicarbonate transporter, which utilizes the inward driving force of the Na+ gradient, rendering it intrinsically voltage-dependent. In addition, the sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger (sNHE) possess a putative voltage sensor that might be activated by membrane hyperpolarization, thus increasing the voltage sensitivity of internal alkalization.

To fertilize the egg, the sperm must undergo a process known as capacitation that takes place in the female genital tract but can also be accomplished in vitro by incubating the sperm in defined conditions (1.Chang M.C.

As a result of capacitation, sperm acquire a special form of motility known as hyperactivation and the ability to undergo a regulated acrosome reaction. Two major ion channels become active in mouse sperm during capacitation, the SLO3 K+ channel and the CATSPER Ca2+ channel. Knock-out mutations of either of these channel genes confers male infertility, indicating that both of these channels play a vital role in sperm physiology (15.Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J.

It has been proposed that the elevation of Ca2+ necessary to hyperactivate the sperm is primarily driven by the concerted interplay of these two ion channel types (16.Navarro B. Kirichok Y. Clapham D.E. KSper, a pH-sensitive K+ current that controls sperm membrane potential.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7688-7692Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18.Zeng X.H.

Simultaneous knockout of Slo3 and CatSper1 abolishes all alkalization- and voltage-activated current in mouse spermatozoa.J. Gen. Physiol. 2013; 142: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the functional relationship between the two channels has not yet been demonstrated. Both of these channels are activated by intracellular alkalization, and both are voltage-activated and open upon depolarization (15.Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L.

Clapham D.E. Whole-cell patch-clamp measurements of spermatozoa reveal an alkaline-activated Ca2+ channel.Nature. 2006; 439: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although voltage-sensitive, sperm-specific SLO3 channels can contribute to the resting potential (9.Chávez J.C. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Escoffier J. Visconti P.E. Treviño C.L. Darszon A. Salkoff L. Santi C.M. Ion permeabilities in mouse sperm reveal an external trigger for SLO3-dependent hyperpolarization.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e60578Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) SLO3 channels have relatively high conductance (15.Schreiber M. Wei A. Yuan A. Gaut J. Saito M. Salkoff L. Slo3, a novel pH-sensitive K+ channel from mammalian spermatocytes.J Biol Chem. 1998; 273: 3509-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and the opening of only a relatively small number of SLO3 channels at resting potential in response to intracellular alkalization is sufficient to hyperpolarize the sperm membrane (9.Chávez J.C. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Escoffier J. Visconti P.E. Treviño C.L. Darszon A. Salkoff L. Santi C.M. Ion permeabilities in mouse sperm reveal an external trigger for SLO3-dependent hyperpolarization.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e60578Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that activation of the SLO3 K+ channel is the principal mechanism whereby the sperm plasma membrane hyperpolarizes during capacitation (16.Navarro B. Kirichok Y. Clapham D.E. KSper, a pH-sensitive K+ current that controls sperm membrane potential.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7688-7692Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17.Santi C.M.

Supporting this are experiments showing that sperm from the knock-out strain of Slo3 (Slo3−/−) lack the hyperpolarization that occurs during capacitation and remain depolarized during the process (17.Santi C.M. Martínez-López P. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Butler A. Alisio A. Darszon A. Salkoff L.

The events that lead to the activation of SLO3 channels and membrane hyperpolarization are complex and varied, but generally, external conditions favorable for capacitation promote internal alkalization (5.Vredenburgh-Wilberg W.L. Parrish J.J. Intracellular pH of bovine sperm increases during capacitation.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6.Breitbart H. Signaling pathways in sperm capacitation and acrosome reaction.Cell. Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we have found that sperm encountering an external alkaline environment alone is sufficient to activate SLO3 channels (9.Chávez J.C. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Escoffier J. Visconti P.E. Treviño C.L. Darszon A. Salkoff L. Santi C.M. Ion permeabilities in mouse sperm reveal an external trigger for SLO3-dependent hyperpolarization.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e60578Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), probably by an increase in pHi. The mechanisms that govern pHi in sperm are complex and might differ between species. In sea urchin sperm it has been proposed that membrane hyperpolarization raises intracellular pH, probably through a Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) 2The abbreviations used are: NHENa+/H+ exchangesNHEsperm-specific Na+/H+ exchangerBCECF2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluoresceinZPzona pellucidaHShigh salt. mechanism (23.Lee H.C.

Update. 2008; 14: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Both the acid load during sperm storage and the subsequent alkaline shift after release are required for fertility. During their transit through the female genital tract sperm encounter increasing external pH and higher concentrations of HCO3−, and both HCO3− and H+ transporters are considered to play a key role in capacitation and sperm hyperactivation (33.Nishigaki T.

Several types of these transporters have been described in mammalian sperm including the Na+/H+ exchanger (34.Garcia M.A. Meizel S.

Transport mechanisms that depend on the stored energy of the Na+ ion gradient rather than ATP are intrinsically voltage-dependent because they rely on the inwardly directed driving force of Na+, which increases with hyperpolarization. In addition, in mouse sperm, a different form of NHE has been described (sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger (sNHE)) that possess a putative voltage sensor domain that could possibly promote activation of Na+/H+ exchange upon membrane hyperpolarization (35.Woo A.L.

It has also been proposed that linear increases observed in pHi following increases in extracellular pH might be due to a membrane proton permeability present in several mammalian species (29.Hamamah S.

In human sperm the proton channel Hv1 has been proposed to play a key role in sperm alkalinization (40.Lishko P.V. Botchkina I.L. Fedorenko A. Kirichok Y. Acid extrusion from human spermatozoa is mediated by flagellar voltage-gated proton channel.Cell. 2010; 140: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This channel is activated by the combination of the pH gradient and membrane depolarization. In addition, it is proposed that Hv1 may also be activated by the removal of zinc during sperm passage through the female genital tract and by encountering anandamide during sperm penetration through the cumulus oophorus (40.Lishko P.V.

Kirichok Y. The role of Hv1 and CatSper channels in sperm activation.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 4667-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, in mouse sperm the Hv1 channel may not play as significant a role in the control of intracellular pH. Based on these facts it was proposed that human and mouse sperm control their intracellular pH in different ways (40.Lishko P.V. Botchkina I.L. Fedorenko A. Kirichok Y. Acid extrusion from human spermatozoa is mediated by flagellar voltage-gated proton channel.Cell. 2010; 140: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, human sperm also have sNHE that can contribute to sperm alkalinization as well (34.Garcia M.A. Meizel S. Regulation of intracellular pH in capacitated human spermatozoa by a Na+/H+ exchanger.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 52: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This could be a significant factor as sperm exit the cauda epididymis, where [Na+] is <25 mm and pH is <7, into the higher [Na+] and slightly more alkaline conditions present in most of the female reproductive tract (42.Florman HM D.T. Fertilization in Mammals.in: Neill J. Physiology of Reproduction. Elsevier, San Diego, CA2006: 55-112Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As sperm enter this new environment, the driving force of the Na+ gradient increases, which may facilitate proton efflux through sNHE, and hence pHi alkalinization. Thus, it is possible that human sperm may utilize two mechanisms for proton efflux, one of which is shared with mouse. Details of the relative importance of Hv1 and sNHE in human sperm are yet to be established. In this study we propose a model by which changes in pHi produced by different mechanisms may integrate the activity of the two sperm-specific ion channels, SLO3 and CATSPER, to produce an influx of Ca2+ ions. The process may unfold when sperm encounter HCO3− and a more alkaline environment in the female genital tract, both of which may initiate an increase in pHi. This may then be responsible for the initial activation of SLO3 channels leading to hyperpolarization, which in turn leads to a further rise in pHi via the effect of hyperpolarization on one of the voltage-sensitive mechanisms described above. The increasing alkalinity may then be sufficient to activate CATSPER channels, allowing Ca2+ influx either incrementally at hyperpolarized voltages or in a bolus upon depolarization. Depolarization can occur experimentally by the application of high extracellular K+ or by a more physiological source such as zona pellucida (ZP) (43.Arnoult C. Zeng Y. Florman H.M. ZP3-dependent activation of sperm cation channels regulates acrosomal secretion during mammalian fertilization.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The data we present in this study are consistent with this model. We show that Slo3−/− mutant sperm, which lack capacitation-associated hyperpolarization, are also deficient in Ca2+ entry through CATSPER channels. Furthermore, we show that the mutant phenotype of deficient Ca2+ entry can be rescued in Slo3−/− mutant sperm by two different strategies: 1) artificial hyperpolarization using the K+-specific ionophore valinomycin, and 2) increasing extracellular pH, which results in an increase in intracellular pH. A plausible hypothesis then is that hyperpolarization per se, which increases the inward driving force on Na+, is contributing to intracellular alkalization, possibly by augmenting the efficiency of H+ export by NHE and/or bicarbonate transport. Supporting this model are experiments we present showing that the treatment of sperm with valinomycin to achieve hyperpolarization in itself elevates internal pH. Valinomycin (catalog number V0627) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (catalog number D8418) were purchased from Sigma. Ionomycin (catalog number 407950) was obtained from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Fluo-4 (catalog number F-14201), Pluronic F-127 (catalog number P3000MP), and 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF; catalog number B-1151) were purchased from Life Technologies. All procedures described herein were reviewed and approved by the Animals Studies Committee of Washington University (St. Louis, MO) and were performed in accord with the National Institutes of Health Guiding Principles of the care and use of laboratory animals. Slo3 knock-out mice were synthesized by removal of the first two coding exons of the Kcnu1 gene (TG0050 TIGM). This removed the initiation codon and DNA sequence encoding the first and partial second membrane-spanning domains (17.Santi C.M. Martínez-López P. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Butler A. Alisio A.

CatSper1 knock-out mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. CatSper knock-out mice were synthesized by replacing the second exon encoding the first putative transmembrane domain, with an IRES-LacZ sequence followed by a neomycin resistance gene in 129S4/SvJae-derived J1 ES cells (19.Ren D.

Caudal epididymal sperm were collected from ∼90-day-old C57BL/6 male breeders from wild-type, Slo3−/− mutant, and CatSper1−/− mutant mice. Minced cauda epididymis from each animal were placed in HS medium (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 20 HEPES, 5 glucose, 10 lactic acid, 1 Na+-pyruvate in pH 7.4 or as indicated. The swim-up procedure was employed to separate the motile fraction of the sperm sample. To capacitate the sperm, we supplemented HS medium with 5 mg/ml BSA and 15 mm NaHCO3 and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. For some experiments, we used solubilized ZP from homogenized ovaries of 60-day-old virgin females obtained according to Ref. 44.Ward C.R. Kopf G.S. Storey B.T.

https://openalex.org/W2046218149,"Background Mitochondrial dysfunction is a crucial mechanism by which cisplatin, a potent chemotherapeutic agent, causes nephrotoxicity where mitochondrial electron transport complexes are shifted mostly toward imbalanced reactive oxygen species versus energy production. In the present study, the protective role of tempol, a membrane-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic agent, was evaluated on mitochondrial dysfunction and the subsequent damage induced by cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice. Methods and Findings Nephrotoxicity was assessed 72 h after a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (25 mg/kg) with or without oral administration of tempol (100 mg/kg/day). Serum creatinine and urea as well as glucosuria and proteinuria were evaluated. Both kidneys were isolated for estimation of oxidative stress markers, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and caspase-3 activity. Moreover, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity, complexes I–IV activities and mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mNOS) protein expression were measured along with histological examinations of renal tubular damage and mitochondrial ultrastructural changes. Tempol was effective against cisplatin-induced elevation of serum creatinine and urea as well as glucosuria and proteinuria. Moreover, pretreatment with tempol notably inhibited cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and disruption of mitochondrial function by restoring mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, complexes I and III activities, mNOS protein expression and ATP content. Tempol also provided significant protection against apoptosis, tubular damage and mitochondrial ultrastructural changes. Interestingly, tempol did not interfere with the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin against the growth of solid Ehrlich carcinoma. Conclusion This study highlights the potential role of tempol in inhibiting cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity without affecting its antitumor activity via amelioration of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2162189888,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of risk scores (Framingham, Assign and QRISK2) in predicting high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in individuals rather than populations.This study included 1.8 million persons without CVD and prior statin prescribing using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This contains electronic medical records of the general population registered with a UK general practice. Individual CVD risks were estimated using competing risk regression models. Individual differences in the 10-year CVD risks as predicted by risk scores and competing risk models were estimated; the population was divided into 20 subgroups based on predicted risk. CVD outcomes occurred in 69,870 persons. In the subgroup with lowest risks, risk predictions by QRISK2 were similar to individual risks predicted using our competing risk model (99.9% of people had differences of less than 2%); in the subgroup with highest risks, risk predictions varied greatly (only 13.3% of people had differences of less than 2%). Larger deviations between QRISK2 and our individual predicted risks occurred with calendar year, different ethnicities, diabetes mellitus and number of records for medical events in the electronic health records in the year before the index date. A QRISK2 estimate of low 10-year CVD risk (<15%) was confirmed by Framingham, ASSIGN and our individual predicted risks in 89.8% while an estimate of high 10-year CVD risk (≥ 20%) was confirmed in only 48.6% of people. The majority of cases occurred in people who had predicted 10-year CVD risk of less than 20%.Application of existing CVD risk scores may result in considerable misclassification of high risk status. Current practice to use a constant threshold level for intervention for all patients, together with the use of different scoring methods, may inadvertently create an arbitrary classification of high CVD risk."

The most extensively studied cellulase is the cellobiohydrolase Cel7A from Trichoderma reesei (an anamorph of the fungus Hypocrea jecorina). TrCel7A is a multidomain enzyme comprising a catalytic domain (core), which is connected by a highly glycosylated linker peptide to a family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) 3The abbreviations used are: CBMcarbohydrate-binding moduleBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.

The three-dimensional crystal structure of the catalytic domain in complex with different cello-oligosaccharides has been solved, revealing a 50-Å-long active site tunnel with 10 glucosyl-binding sites, numbered from −7 at the entrance of the tunnel to +3 at the exit (8Divne C.

The enzyme hydrolyzes cellulose processively from the reducing end with the scissile bond between subsite −1 and +1, hence leaving cellobiose in the +1,+2 expulsion site. Analysis of processive hydrolysis requires consideration of a number of steps, including adsorption, surface diffusion, recognition, “threading,” complex formation, catalysis, product expulsion, processive sliding, and dissociation (4Beckham G.T.

It is of particular importance to identify the slowest and hence rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle. Numerous earlier studies have addressed this question, and interestingly, it appears as if the conclusions fall mainly into two mutually conflicting groups. Thus, a number of works have used either direct experimental evidence or re-examination of broader, previously published material to conclude that the overall rate is governed by the association of enzyme and substrate, particularly the placement of a cellulose strand in the long active tunnel (11Shang B.Z.

In contrast to this, other studies, including work by this group on the pre-steady state kinetics of wild type Cel7A, have suggested that the formation of the activated complex is quite rapid and that dissociation of enzyme, which is in a position where further processive movement is hindered, is the rate-limiting step (19Kurasin M.

To elucidate this question, we have designed, expressed, and purified variants of TrCel7A with lower affinity for the substrate. The idea was that the kinetic behavior of an enzyme with a less stable substrate complex could reveal whether the bottleneck was located before or after the activated complex (i.e. whether rate limitation was one of the associating or dissociating steps). Specifically, we replaced Trp-38 located in subsite −4 (Fig. 1) in the active tunnel with Ala. Previous work has suggested that this tryptophan residue interacts with the substrate (8Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. High-resolution crystal structures reveal how a cellulose chain is bound in the 50 Å long tunnel of cellobiohydrolase I from Trichoderma reesei.J. Mol.

Here, we report a comparative analysis of steady-state kinetics, adsorption, and processivity for wild type TrCel7A and the Trp-38 → Ala variant, henceforth termed WT and W38A, respectively. To assess possible effects of the CBM, we have made this comparison both for the intact enzyme and the catalytic domain alone. All experiments were conducted in a standard 50 mm acetate buffer, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 5.0. All enzymes were expressed heterologously in Aspergillus oryzae and purified as described elsewhere (27Westh, P., Kari, J., Olsen, J., Borch, K., Jensen, K., Krogh, K. B. R. M., (May 1, 2014) PCT International Patent Application WO/2014/064115, C12N 9/00 Ed.Google Scholar). Core variants (i.e. the catalytic domain alone) were made by introducing a BamHI restriction-site in the TrCel7A gene at the end of the core domain, making it possible to splice out the core domain from the TrCel7A plasmid or W38A plasmid. All purified enzyme stocks showed a single band in SDS NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel (GE Healthcare), and the absence of specific contamination by β-glucosidase was confirmed by the lack of activity against p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside. Henceforth, we will use subscript “intact” for enzymes with and “core” for enzymes without the CBM. Enzyme concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients of 84,810 m−1 cm−1, 79,120 m−1 cm−1, 79,210 m−1 cm−1, and 73,520 m−1 cm−1 for WTintact, W38Aintact, WTcore, and W38Acore, respectively. The cellobiose production was monitored by an amperometric enzyme biosensor based on cellobiose dehydrogenase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium adsorbed onto the surface of a benzoquinone-modified carbon paste electrode as described in detail previously (28Cruys-Bagger N.

Measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a 5-ml water-jacketed glass cell connected to a water bath. Avicel PH 101 (Sigma-Aldrich) suspensions were stirred at 600 rpm, and enzyme was injected to a final concentration of 100 nm from a Chemyx Fusion 100 syringe pump with an injection time of 1.0 s. All measurements were made in duplicate with calibration before and after each run, using the average sensitivity as the calibration factor (28Cruys-Bagger N. Ren G. Tatsumi H. Baumann M.J.

Bioeng. 2012; 109: 3199-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The adsorption of enzyme on Avicel was measured in 96-well microtiter plates by adding substrate and enzyme to a final volume of 300 μl in each well. The substrate load was 10 g/liter for enzymes with CBM and 30 g/liter for the core variants, and the enzyme concentration was varied from 0 to 5 μm. The plate was sealed and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C and 1200 rpm orbital mixing. After incubation, the plate was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min, and 100 μl of supernatant was transferred to black 96-well microtiter plates. Intrinsic protein fluorescence was determined by measuring the emission at 340 nm at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. In all experiments, an enzyme standard curve was made using the enzyme in question as reference. The production of glucose, cellobiose, and cellotriose was measured at different time points by taking 500-μl subsets of a 50-ml reaction mixture, containing 10 g/liter Avicel and 0.50 μm enzyme at 25.0 °C. Subsets were quenched by mixing with the same volume 0.1 m NaOH, and following centrifugation, the concentrations of glucose, cellobiose, and cellotriose in the supernatants were measured on a Dionex ICS-5000 ion chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as described elsewhere (27Westh, P., Kari, J., Olsen, J., Borch, K., Jensen, K., Krogh, K.

The enzyme concentration was 100 nm in all trials, whereas the load of Avicel was varied over 2 orders of magnitude (0.5–60 g/liter).

The enzyme subsequently moves along the strand, which is sequentially shortened by one cellobiose, moiety C, for each step (so the strand is converted to Cm-1, Cm-2, etc.). In this process, the activated complexes (ECm-1, ECm-2 …) are all allowed two reaction pathways. They may either go through another catalytic cycle to produce a cellobiose and a correspondingly shortened cellulose strand, or they may dissociate. This reaction mechanism can be kinetically described by four parameters. These are the rate constants for association (kon), catalysis (kcat), and dissociation (koff) and the processivity number, n (the average number of sequential steps made following the attack of one cellulose strand). At quasi-steady state, the rate of cellobiose production according to the processive reaction in Scheme 1, pVSS, attains the usual hyperbolic form (23Cruys-Bagger N. Elmerdahl J. Praestgaard E. Borch K. Westh P. A steady-state theory for processive cellulases.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 3952-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), pVSS= pVmaxS pKm+S(Eq. 1) where S is the load of substrate in g/liter, and the processive kinetic parameters, pKm and pVmax, are defined by the processivity, n, and the rate constants from Scheme 1. pKm=koffkon(Eq. 2) and pVmax=βE0kcat(Eq. 3) (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3) rely on the assumption that the substrate is in excess (i.e. that the concentration of attack sites for enzyme on the substrate surface is much larger than the enzyme concentration). This has previously been shown to be a reasonable assumption for conditions similar to those used here (22Cruys-Bagger N. Elmerdahl J. Praestgaard E. Tatsumi H. Spodsberg N. Borch K. Westh P.

A steady-state theory for processive cellulases.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 3952-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We note that the main difference between the parameters for processive enzyme activity given in Equations 2 and 3 and the analogous parameters in the conventional Michaelis-Menten equation is the constant, β. This so-called kinetic processivity coefficient is defined, β = 1 − (kcat/(kcat + koff))n and may be interpreted as the probability that the enzyme will dissociate from the cellulose strand before completing the average number (n) of processive steps (23Cruys-Bagger N. Elmerdahl J. Praestgaard E. Borch K. Westh P. A steady-state theory for processive cellulases.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 3952-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The experimental data in Fig. 2 are typical for cellulases in the sense that a truly constant reaction rate (i.e. a fully linear progress curve) is never observed. As argued previously (23Cruys-Bagger N. Elmerdahl J. Praestgaard E. Borch K. Westh P. A steady-state theory for processive cellulases.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 3952-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this requires some compromise in the definition of the steady-state rate, and it was recommended to assign pVSS as the slope of the concentration trace after the initial burst, which represents a non-steady-state condition (23Cruys-Bagger N.

In accordance with this, we fitted a line to the data from 100 to 150 s in Fig. 2 and used the slope as a measure of pVSS. Results are plotted as a function of the Avicel load in Fig. 3. Comparisons of data for the two enzymes with CBM (WTintact and W38Aintact) and the two catalytic domains (WTcore and W38Acore), respectively, again show that the W38A mutation slightly decreases activity at very low substrate load but significantly promotes pVSS when the Avicel load approaches saturating levels. Fig. 3 also shows that Equation 1 accounts well for the experimental data for all four enzymes, and the kinetic parameters derived from the regression analysis based on Equation 1 are listed in Table 1. These parameters reveal that the two W38A variants have 1.6–2 times higher pVmax compared with the corresponding enzymes without this mutation. Conversely, the affinity for the substrate is lowered by the W38A mutation (pKm is increased 4 times for the intact enzyme and 2 times for the core variant).TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic and adsorption parameters for the four investigated TrCel7A variants, WTintact, W38Aintact, WTcore, and W38AcoreEnzymeKinetic parametersAdsorption parameterspVmaxpKmpVmax/pKmΓmaxKdΓmax/Kdnm/sg/liternmol/s/gnmol/gμmliter/gWTintact19.5 ±0.61.54 ± 0.2312.7 ± 1.93195 ± 70.145 ± 0.0191.345 ± 0.183W38Aintact38.4 ± 0.75.95 ± 0.346.5 ± 0.39114 ± 40.544 ± 0.0610.210 ± 0.025WTcore34.4 ± 1.812.6 ± 1.822.7 ± 0.4230 ± 21.43 ± 0.1950.021 ± 0.003W38Acore53.2 ± 2.924.3 ± 2.872.2 ± 0.2822 ± 32.97 ± 0.6200.008 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab The effect of the W38A mutation on substrate affinity was further investigated by adsorption measurements. Results in Fig. 4 show the characteristic adsorption saturation and a strong effect of the CBM, which have been discussed in detail earlier both for TrCel7A and numerous related cellulases (32Ståhlberg J.

Surface density of cellobiohydrolase on crystalline celluloses.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2869-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the current context, it is more important to note that the W38A mutation significantly reduces binding both in the intact enzyme and in the core variant. To quantify this, we analyzed the data with respect to a standard Langmuir isotherm, Γ, where the variables E and Γ represent free concentration and adsorbed amount of enzyme, respectively, and Γmax and Kd are the usual Langmuir parameters (saturation coverage and dissociation constant). The Langmuir isotherm was found to account well for the experimental data, and the parameters are listed in Table 1. It appears that the mutation weakens the interaction significantly because Kd increased 3.7 times in the intact enzyme and 2.1 times in the core variant. The saturation coverage, Γmax, was also reduced (30–40%) by the mutation, indicating a reduced substrate accessibility for the mutant. Progress curves for glucose, cellobiose, and cellotriose produced by WTintact and W38Aintact are shown in Fig. 5. These measurements were made to assess the influence of the W38A mutation on the processivity. It has previously been suggested that processivity can be estimated from the cellobiose/cellotriose ratio of either concentrations or steady-state production rates (31Kipper K. Väljamäe P.

Applying these principles, we found processivities of 23–24 for WTintact and 15–16 for W38Aintact. Product profiles were only measured for one enzyme concentration, and the following discussion of processivity hence neglects a possible dependence of n on the enzyme/substrate ratio. We note, however, that the enzyme/substrate ratio in the product profile measurements (Fig. 5) was comparable with the ratio in the kinetic measurements (Fig. 2) for substrate loads around pKm and hence that the two types of experiments appear compatible. The processivity of the wild type TrCel7A on Avicel has been measured before (15Nakamura A. Watanabe H. Ishida T. Uchihashi T. Wada M. Ando T. Igarashi K. Samejima M.

The distribution of granule dimension is bimodal, with a majority of small spherical B-granules and a smaller amount of large discoidal A-granules containing the majority of the starch. Starch granules are semi-crystalline structures with characteristic X-ray diffraction patterns. Distinct features of starch granules are controlled by different enzymes and are relevant for nutritional value or industrial applications. Here, the Targeting-Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) approach was applied on the barley TILLMore TILLING population to identify 29 new alleles in five genes related to starch metabolism known to be expressed in the endosperm during grain filling: BMY1 (Beta-amylase 1), GBSSI (Granule Bound Starch Synthase I), LDA1 (Limit Dextrinase 1), SSI (Starch Synthase I), SSIIa (Starch Synthase IIa). Reserve starch of nine M3 mutant lines carrying missense or nonsense mutations was analysed for granule size, crystallinity and amylose/amylopectin content. Seven mutant lines presented starches with different features in respect to the wild-type: (i) a mutant line with a missense mutation in GBSSI showed a 4-fold reduced amylose/amylopectin ratio; (ii) a missense mutations in SSI resulted in 2-fold increase in A:B granule ratio; (iii) a nonsense mutation in SSIIa was associated with shrunken seeds with a 2-fold increased amylose/amylopectin ratio and different type of crystal packing in the granule; (iv) the remaining four missense mutations suggested a role of LDA1 in granule initiation, and of SSIIa in determining the size of A-granules. We demonstrate the feasibility of the TILLING approach to identify new alleles in genes related to starch metabolism in barley. Based on their novel physicochemical properties, some of the identified new mutations may have nutritional and/or industrial applications."

The apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) system is involved in the regulation of cardiovascular function and central control of body homeostasis. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry, we first identified phosphorylated serine residues in the C terminus of APJ. To determine the role of phosphorylation sites in APJ-mediated G protein-dependent and -independent signaling and function, we induced a mutation in the C-terminal serine residues and examined their effects on the interaction between APJ with G protein or GRK/β-arrestin and their downstream signaling. Mutation of serine 348 led to an elimination of both GRK and β-arrestin recruitment to APJ induced by apelin-13. Moreover, APJ internalization and G protein-independent ERK signaling were also abolished by point mutation at serine 348. In contrast, this mutant at serine residues had no demonstrable impact on apelin-13-induced G protein activation and its intracellular signaling. These findings suggest that mutation of serine 348 resulted in inactive GRK/β-arrestin. However, there was no change in the active G protein thus, APJ conformation was biased.

Upon stimulation by agonists, GPCRs are activated and initiate intracellular signaling events. In addition to G protein-dependent signaling, the activated GPCRs may also interact with many intracellular proteins to expand their ability to transmit signals through G protein-independent signaling pathway, such as G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins. In this process, the agonist-occupied receptor is phosphorylated by GRKs, subsequently recruiting cytoplasmic β-arrestins to the GRK-phosphorylated receptor (4.Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Regulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins during receptor desensitization.Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). As intracellular adaptor and scaffolding proteins, β-arrestins play important roles in GPCRs desensitization, internalization, and intracellular trafficking and could activate signaling cascades independently of G protein activation (5.Luttrell L.M.

APJ remained an orphan GPCR until 1998 when the peptide apelin was isolated from bovine stomach extracts as its endogenous ligand (11.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Isolation and characterization of a novel endogenous peptide ligand for the human APJ receptor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Subsequently, numerous researchers have showed that apelin has an important regulatory role in various physiological processes. Among them, apelin-13 exhibits much stronger activity than other active isoforms in regulating the cardiovascular function (11.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.X.

The apelin/APJ system is currently envisaged to be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of heart failure, hypertension, and obesity-related diseases (12.Giddings A.S.R. Thomas J.

Duparc T. Knauf C. Valet P. Apelin, diabetes, and obesity.Endocrine. 2011; 40: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of APJ signal transduction are still under active investigation. New research has found that APJ has a dual role in cardiac hypertrophy (14.Scimia M.C. Hurtado C. Ray S. Metzler S. Wei K. Wang J. Woods C.E. Purcell N.H. Catalucci D. Akasaka T. Bueno O.F. Vlasuk G.P. Kaliman P. Bodmer R. Smith L.H. Ashley E. Mercola M. Brown J.H. Ruiz-Lozano P. APJ acts as a dual receptor in cardiac hypertrophy.Nature. 2012; 488: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Apelin activates the signals of APJ through the Gαi pathway and elicits a cardiac protective response. Although sustained overload activates APJ to induce cardiac hypertrophy via a G protein-independent fashion. Previous data suggested that the C-terminal portion of APJ are required for internalization and mediates receptor internalization through palmitoylation and phosphorylation (15.Masri B. Morin N. Pedebernade L. Knibiehler B. Audigier Y. The apelin receptor is coupled to Gi1 or Gi2 protein and is differentially desensitized by apelin fragments.J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated that mutagenesis of key serine/threonine residues at receptor phosphorylation result in diminished β-arrestin binding after agonist stimulation in receptors such as the M2 muscarinic receptor, the AT1A angiotensin receptor, and the V2 vasopressin receptor (16.Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

There are several putative phosphorylated amino acids at the C terminus of APJ, which has not been investigated. In the work presented here, we first identified a key C-terminal amino acid residue required for GRKs/β-arrestins recruitment to activated APJ after agonist binding. We found that the key residue for APJ regulation is serine 348. Furthermore, we assessed the role of serine 348 in APJ internalization and G protein-independent ERK1/2 activation. The results suggest that serine 348 is required for GRKs and β-arrestin-mediated biased G protein independent signaling of APJ. Taken together, these results are helpful for screening novel and existing drugs of the cardiovascular system based on this biased signaling pathway.

The HPLC gradient consists of holding 0% buffer B for 3 min, followed by increasing to 5% buffer B in 5 min, to 35% buffer B in 35 min, then to 60% buffer B in 5 min. In the following 2 min, the gradient was increased to 80% for 2 min. Initial chromatographic conditions were restored in 1 min and maintained for 10 min. A flow rate of 300 nl/min was used to elute the peptides into the ionization source of the mass spectrometer. The acquired MS/MS spectra were processed with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) for database correlation analysis. The search parameters through Mascot were set for phosphorylation emphasis and to search for biological modifications. Trypsin was set as the enzyme, and the IPI human database was searched. Each filtered MS/MS spectra exhibiting possible phosphorylated peptide was manually checked and validated. The pcDNA3.1(+)-APJ and pcDNA3.1(+)-HA tagged-APJ plasmids were purchased from Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). Rluc-β-arrestin1 and Rluc-β-arrestin2 were generated by PCR amplification with plasmids containing β-arrestin1/β-arrestin2 ORF (kindly provided by Prof. Karin Eidne (QEII Medical Centre, Nedlands, Australia)) as templates, the coding sequences of human β-arrestin without their stop codons and subcloned into pRluc-N1 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.). On the other hand, the cDNA encoding the hAPJ without its stop codon was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Plasmids GRK2-GFP2 and GRK5-GFP2 were kindly provided by Prof. Christian E. Elling, 7TM Pharma A/S, 2970 Horsholm, Denmark. FLAG-tagged β-arrestin1/β-arrestin2 was kindly provided by Prof. Vsevolod V. Gurevich (Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University). For construction of the Gαi2-Rluc and Gαq-Rluc fusion proteins, the coding sequence of humanized Rluc was PCR amplified and inserted in the coding sequence of each Gα subunit. Depending on the Gα subunit, the Rluc was inserted between either residues 91 and 92 of Gαi2, or residues 97 and 98 of Gαq. A series of APJ mutants were generated by overlap extension PCR using high fidelity Pfu polymerase and mutagenic primers as described previously (22.Li Y. Chen J. Bai B. Du H. Liu Y. Liu H. Heterodimerization of human apelin and κ opioid receptors: roles in signal transduction.Cell Signal. 2012; 24: 991-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mutagenic APJ cDNA was cut sequentially with EcoRI and HindIII and then ligated back into the original pcDNA3.1(+). All mutational cDNAs were confirmed by sequence analysis of both strands. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the same amount of pcDNA3.1(+) containing HA-tagged wild-type APJ or HA-tagged APJ-S335A, APJ-S345A, and APJ-S348A. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated in blocking solution (3% BSA) for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 1:1000 primary rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the immunoreactivity was detected by the addition of TMB Plus substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the reaction was stopped with 0.2 m H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). For each experiment, mock conditions corresponding to the transfection of vector without receptor were included. The expression levels of mutational receptors were calculated as a percentage of WT APJ expression using the formula: [(ODmutant − ODmock)/(ODwt − ODmock)] × 100%. Receptor internalization was measured with 100 nm apelin-13 treatment in 60 min at 37 °C by the above cell surface ELISA procedure. The percentages of mutational receptor internalization were defined as described previously (23.Hawtin S.R. Charged residues of the conserved DRY triplet of the vasopressin V1a receptor provide molecular determinants for cell surface delivery and internalization.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using the formula: [(ODbasal − ODmock) − (ODstimulated − ODmock)]/(ODbasal − ODmock) × 100%. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the same amount of WT APJ and mutational APJs. 48 h after transfection, a washed cell membrane preparation was prepared as described previously (24.Chen J. Randeva H.S. Genomic organization of mouse orexin receptors: characterization of two novel tissue-specific splice variants.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2790-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The interactions of 125I-apelin-13 with WT APJ or mutational APJ receptors were measured using radioligand binding displacement binding assays according to a previous report (9.Katugampola S.D. Maguire J.J. Matthewson S.R. Davenport A.P. [125I]-(Pyr(1))Apelin-13 is a novel radioligand for localizing the APJ orphan receptor in human and rat tissues with evidence for a vasoconstrictor role in man.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 6-well plates, grown to 60% confluence, and transiently co-transfected with constant amounts of plasmids encoding for HA-APJ and EGFP-β-arrestins. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, medium was changed to serum-free DMEM, and the cells were incubated with 100 nm apelin-13 at different time intervals. Then, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with 3% BSA in PBS/Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 1 h at room temperature. For the staining, anti-HA antibody was incubated as the first antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing the cells with PBS, cells were incubated with IgG TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Following a wash step, the cells were mounted on glass slides with VECTASHIELD medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., Peterborough, UK). Images were observed with a ×63 oil immersion objective in a Leica model DMRE laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Rluc-tagged and various EGFP (or GFP2)-tagged constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were then harvested in HEPES-buffered phenol red-free complete medium containing 5% FCS and seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well white microplates (Corning 3600). All BRET measurements were performed according to the donor and acceptor pairs used (Table 1) by the Mithras LB940 plate reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) and MicroWin 2000 software as described previously.TABLE 1Summary of substrate and filter setting used in BRET assaysMethodDonorSubstrateDonor emissionAcceptorAcceptor emissionnmnmBRET1RlucCoelenterazine h460EGFP535BRET2RlucDeep Blue C400GFP2515eBRETRlucEnduRenTM460EGFP535 Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (25.Wang C. Pan Y. Zhang R. Bai B. Chen J. Randeva H.S. Heterodimerization of mouse orexin type 2 receptor variants and the effects on signal transduction.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-APJ (or HA-APJ348) and FLAG-β-arrestin1 (or β-arrestin2) or the vector control. 36 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 100 nm apelin-13 for 15 min. For co-immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed and the supernatant fractions were collected and then incubated with anti-HA-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed three times with TBST and precipitates were eluted with SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants were then analyzed with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for anti-FLAG antibody immunoreactivity. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the WT APJ and various mutational APJs (APJ-S335A, APJ-S345A, APJ-S348A) as described above. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mm) and MgCl2 (10 mm) for 20 min and then stimulated for 10 min with forskolin (10 µm) in either the absence or presence of various concentrations of apelin-13 (0.1–10,000 nm) at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and suspended in acetate buffer. Intracellular cAMP level was measured using the absorbance-based cAMP ELISA kits (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293 cells expressing WT APJ or mutants were plated at 5 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well poly-d-lysine-coated black plate (Corning), respectively. In addition, un-transfected HEK293 cells were used as negative controls. Calcium fluorescences were detected using Fluo-4 NW Calcium Assay Kits (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before the detection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dye loading solution dissolved in assay buffer. Following incubation, the plates were washed twice with assay buffer, equilibrated at room temperature for an additional 30 min. Subsequently, all cells stimulated with 100 nm apelin-13 and calcium fluorescences were immediately detected with the Mithras LB940 plate reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Basal readings were obtained for 5 s prior to agonist addition and subtracted from post-injection readings to obtain a ligand-induced Ca2+ response. Calcium fluorescence ratio was represented using the formula: ligand-induced Ca2+ readings/basal readings. Data were imported into GraphPad Prism 5 software for statistical analysis and graphing. HEK293 cells expressing WT APJ or APJ-S348A in six-well plates were grown to 70–80% confluences. After overnight serum starvation, the cells were treated with apelin-13. Subsequently, cells were washed, harvested, and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. Ten micrograms of cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 was detected by immunoblotting with the antibody against phospho-ERK1/2. As a control for loading, the same membranes were stripped of antibody and re-probed with anti-total ERK1/2 antibody. The band intensities were measured by densitometry analysis and the change in ERK phosphorylation in both samples was calculated as the phospho-ERK/ERK ratio (see Ref. 19.Bai B. Tang J. Liu H. Chen J. Li Y. Song W. Apelin-13 induces ERK1/2 but not p38 MAPK activation through coupling of the human apelin receptor to the Gi2 pathway.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2008; 40: 311-318Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar for details). For β-arrestin1/2 shRNA experiments, HEK-293 cells stably expressing APJ or APJ-S348A were transiently transfected with either β-arrestin1 shRNA (Sigma, Clone ID NM_004041.3–828s21c1) or β-arrestin2 shRNA (Sigma, Clone ID NM_004313.3–309s21c1) and shRNA Negative Control Med GC (Sigma, pLKO.1-puro) according to the manufacturer's instructions using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Forty-eight hours later, cells were stimulated with apelin-13 and lysed for ERK1/2 assays. All data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Data were presented and analyzed using Prism 5.0 graphing software (GraphPad). Sigmoidal curves were fitted to the dose-response data using non-linear regression. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison post-test. Previous studies have shown that C-terminal serines of APJ are required for mediating receptor desensitization and internalization (15.Masri B. Morin N. Pedebernade L. Knibiehler B. Audigier Y. The apelin receptor is coupled to Gi1 or Gi2 protein and is differentially desensitized by apelin fragments.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18317-18326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the key residues involved in APJ regulation have not been defined. Putative APJ phosphorylation sites were obtained from NetPhos 2.0 prediction software (26.Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Sequence and structure-based prediction of eukaryotic protein phosphorylation sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) with APJ C-terminal serine 335, 345, and 348 mutants being chosen as above. Among them, sequence analysis revealed that serine 345 and 348 are highly conserved C-terminal phosphorylation sites between human, mouse, rat, and other creatures (Fig. 1A). To identify precise phosphorylation sites, we treated the stably transfected HEK293 cells with 100 nm apelin-13 for 10 min. Cell lysis and protein extraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained (Fig. 2A). Following reduction and alkylation as described under ”Experimental Procedures,“ we used mass spectrometry to better define the specific sites phosphorylated in APJ under apelin-13 stimulation. We conducted a mass spectrometric analysis of the phosphoacceptor sites on APJ and two serine phosphor-acceptor sites (Ser-345 and Ser-348) in the C-terminal tail of APJ are shown in Fig. 2B. To determine which phosphorylation site identified was most likely to be the most important for the function of APJ, we generated mammalian APJ expression plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis to construct C-terminal receptor serine to alanine mutants. After a series of mutants were constructed, we first investigated the cell surface expression level of WT APJ, APJ-S335A, APJ-S345A, and APJ-S348A in HEK293 cells. Both ELISA and BRET results showed that all three point mutants had little effect on the receptor cell surface expression compared with the WT APJ (Fig. 1, B and C). This data suggested that APJ mutants were correctly synthesized and trafficked to the plasma membrane. To characterize the binding properties of APJ, WT and mutational APJs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. Competitive displacement studies of 125I-apelin-13 by apelin-13 (cold), showed no differences in IC50 values of the WT APJ and mutational APJs (Table 2). Also, the Bmax values for binding 125I-apelin-13 to the membrane preparation did not differ (Table 2). The results further verified that the mutagenesis of APJ C-terminal serine residues had little influence on agonist binding. At least, serines 335, 345, and 348 were not key residues for apelin binding. Upon agonist binding, the mutants were likely to be activated and transmit downstream signaling, which can be used for subsequent experiments.TABLE 2Binding characteristics of WT and mutational APJsReceptorIC50Bmaxnmfmol/mg proteinWT APJ0.68 ± 0.088.26 ± 0.17APJ-S335A0.75 ± 0.047.92 ± 0.34APJ-S345A0.67 ± 0.058.43 ± 0.15APJ-S348A0.70 ± 0.098.37 ± 0.35 Open table in a new tab The effect of apelin-13 on cAMP signaling in HEK293 cells was previously studied (19.Bai B.

https://openalex.org/W1981169922,"Background Many advances have been recently made focused on the valuable help of dietary polyphenols in chronic inflammatory diseases. On the other hand, current treatment options for intestinal bowel disease patients are unsatisfying and, for this reason, it is estimated that many patients use dietary supplements to achieve extra benefits. Aim The aim of this work was to analyze under a mechanistic perspective the anti-inflammatory potential of resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, and to compare it with a pharmaceutical agent, 5-aminosalicylic acid, using the intestinal HT-29 cell line, as a cellular model. Methodology and Principal Findings In the present study, HT-29 colon epithelial cells were pre-treated with 25 µM resveratrol and/or 500 µM 5-aminosalicylic acid and then exposed to a combination of cytokines (IL-1α, TNF-α, IFN-γ) for a certain period of time. Our data showed that resveratrol, used in a concentration 20 times lower than 5-aminosalicylic acid, was able to significantly reduce NO and PGE2 production, iNOS and COX-2 expression and reactive oxidant species formation induced by the cytokine challenge. However, as already verified with 5-aminosalicylic acid, in spite of not exhibiting any effect on IkB-α degradation, resveratrol down-regulated JAK-STAT pathway, decreasing the levels of activated STAT1 in the nucleus. Additionally, resveratrol decreased the cytokine-stimulated activation of SAPK/JNK pathway but did not counteract the cytokine-triggered negative feedback mechanism of STAT1, through p38 MAPK. Conclusion/Significance Taken together, our results show that resveratrol may be considered a future nutraceutical approach, promoting remission periods, limiting the inflammatory process and preventing colorectal cancer, which is common in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2040044981,"Exotic invasive species can directly and indirectly influence natural ecological communities. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is non-native to the western United States and has invaded large areas of the Great Basin. Changes to the structure and composition of plant communities invaded by cheatgrass likely have effects at higher trophic levels. As a keystone guild in North American deserts, granivorous small mammals drive and maintain plant diversity. Our objective was to assess potential effects of invasion by cheatgrass on small-mammal communities. We sampled small-mammal and plant communities at 70 sites (Great Basin, Utah). We assessed abundance and diversity of the small-mammal community, diversity of the plant community, and the percentage of cheatgrass cover and shrub species. Abundance and diversity of the small-mammal community decreased with increasing abundance of cheatgrass. Similarly, cover of cheatgrass remained a significant predictor of small-mammal abundance even after accounting for the loss of the shrub layer and plant diversity, suggesting that there are direct and indirect effects of cheatgrass. The change in the small-mammal communities associated with invasion of cheatgrass likely has effects through higher and lower trophic levels and has the potential to cause major changes in ecosystem structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1999772546,"Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an increased number of CAG repeats in the HTT gene coding for huntingtin. Decreased neurotrophic support and increased mitochondrial and excitotoxic stress have been reported in HD striatal and cortical neurons. The members of the class O forkhead (FOXO) transcription factor family, including FOXO3a, act as sensor proteins that are activated upon decreased survival signals and/or increased cellular stress. Using immunocytochemical screening in mouse striatal Hdh(7/7) (wild type), Hdh(7/109) (heterozygous for HD mutation), and Hdh(109/109) (homozygous for HD mutation) cells, we identified FOXO3a as a differentially regulated transcription factor in HD. We report increased nuclear FOXO3a levels in mutant Hdh cells. Additionally, we show that treatment with mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid results in enhanced nuclear localization of FOXO3a in wild type Hdh(7/7) cells and in rat primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, mRNA levels of Foxo3a are increased in mutant Hdh cells compared with wild type cells and in 3-nitropropionic acid-treated primary neurons compared with untreated neurons. A similar increase was observed in the cortex of R6/2 mice and HD patient post-mortem caudate tissue compared with controls. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays, we demonstrate that FOXO3a regulates its own transcription by binding to the conserved response element in Foxo3a promoter. Altogether, the findings of this study suggest that FOXO3a levels are increased in HD cells as a result of overactive positive feedback loop."
https://openalex.org/W2052857169,"Although the pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx-1) transcription factor is known to play an indispensable role in β cell development and secretory function, recent data also implicate Pdx-1 in the maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) health. The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) pump maintains a steep Ca2+ gradient between the cytosol and ER lumen. In models of diabetes, our data demonstrated loss of β cell Pdx-1 that occurs in parallel with altered SERCA2b expression, whereas in silico analysis of the SERCA2b promoter revealed multiple putative Pdx-1 binding sites. We hypothesized that Pdx-1 loss under inflammatory and diabetic conditions leads to decreased SERCA2b levels and activity with concomitant alterations in ER health. To test this, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pdx-1 was performed in INS-1 cells. The results revealed reduced SERCA2b expression and decreased ER Ca2+, which was measured using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Cotransfection of human Pdx-1 with a reporter fused to the human SERCA2 promoter increased luciferase activity 3- to 4-fold relative to an empty vector control, and direct binding of Pdx-1 to the proximal SERCA2 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. To determine whether restoration of SERCA2b could rescue ER stress induced by Pdx-1 loss, Pdx1+/− mice were fed a high-fat diet. Isolated islets demonstrated an increased spliced-to-total Xbp1 ratio, whereas SERCA2b overexpression reduced the Xbp1 ratio to that of wild-type controls. Together, these results identify SERCA2b as a novel transcriptional target of Pdx-1 and define a role for altered ER Ca2+ regulation in Pdx-1-deficient states.

As secretory cells, β cells are dependent upon a highly developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to ensure that proteins are produced robustly and folded efficiently. Under conditions of metabolic stress, proteins may fail to fold correctly within the β cell ER lumen, initiating an unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR limits the delivery of new proteins to the ER and, ultimately, increases protein folding capacity through increased transcription and activity of protein chaperones and foldases. However, if the inciting stress is unresolved, continual stimulation of the UPR leads to the activation of apoptotic pathways and β cell death, a transition referred to as ER stress (2Evans-Molina C.

Islets isolated from Pdx-1 haploinsufficient mice demonstrate ER stress when animals are exposed to a high-fat diet, and Pdx-1 has been shown to enhance the transcription of a number of proteins involved in UPR signaling and ER function, including activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) and Wolframin (Wfs1) (9Tersey S.A.

Interestingly, our in silico analysis of the human SERCA2b promoter revealed multiple putative binding sites for Pdx-1. Given an emerging role for Pdx-1 in the maintenance of an ER-specific subgenome, we hypothesized that Pdx-1 may serve as a transcriptional regulator of the SERCA2 gene and that loss of Pdx-1 may underlie decreased SERCA2b expression, altered Ca2+ regulation, and activation of β cell ER stress signaling pathways in diabetes.

Human islets isolated from cadaveric non-diabetic and diabetic donors were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange or the Integrated Islet Distribution Program. On arrival, islets were immediately placed in DMEM containing 5.5 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Our analysis included islets from five non-diabetic donors and three donors with an established diagnosis of T2D. The average age of non-diabetic donors was 45.2 ± 6.1 years (S.E.), and the average body mass index was 27.6 ± 2.8 kg/m2. The average age of the donors with T2D was 53.0 ± 4.4 years, and the average body mass index was 22.7 ± 2.7 kg/m2.

The anti-Pdx-1 siRNA sequence used was 5′-GAAAGAGGAAGATAAGAAA-3′, and the random siRNA sequence was 5′-GAGACCCTATCCGTGATTA-3′. After 24–48 h, RNA or protein was isolated for the indicated analyses, or cells were used for Ca2+ imaging. For viral transduction of isolated mouse islets, groups of 50–100 islets were hand-picked within 1 h of isolation, incubated with adenovirus for 24 h, and washed with PBS followed by Ca2+ imaging or RNA or protein isolation. To simulate hyperglycemic and proinflammatory conditions in vitro, INS-1 cells were treated with 25 mm glucose and 5 ng/ml IL-1β for 16–24 h using a protocol established previously (19Kono T. Ahn G.

Endocrinol. 2012; 26: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Isolated islets or cultured cells were washed with PBS and lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% desoxycholate, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.1% SDS, 0.2% sarcosyl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% v/v benzonase nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysate from isolated islets was further disrupted by mechanical shearing using a 20-gauge needle and syringe. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) and a SpectraMax M5 multiwell plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Equal concentrations of proteins were suspended in 10% SDS solution prior to electrophoresis using a 4–20% Mini-Protean TGX gel in a Mini-Protean Tetra apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) prior to incubation with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used included the following: Pdx-1 (catalog no. 07-696 Millipore, Billerica, MA), SERCA2 (catalog no. sc-8095, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), Actin (catalog no. 691002, MP Biomed, Santa Ana, CA), and GAPDH (catalog no. ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Of note is that the SERCA2 antibody does not distinguish between the SERCA2a and SERCA2b isoforms. However, we have shown previously that SERCA2a is expressed at very low levels in mouse islets (19Kono T. Ahn G. Moss D.R. Gann L. Zarain-Herzberg A. Nishiki Y. Fueger P.T. Ogihara T. Evans-Molina C.

Immunoblots were scanned using a LI-COR Odyssey 1828 scanner and analyzed with LI-COR Image Studio software, with the densitometry of the scanned images calculated by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cultured cells or isolated islets were processed for total RNA using RNeasy Mini plus or Micro plus kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the instructions of the manufacturer and as described previously (43Sturek J.M.

After 24 h, cells were transduced with siPdx-1 or random siRNA adenovirus, and isolated mouse islets were transduced with SERCA2 or LacZ adenovirus as described. Prior to imaging, INS-1 cells and islets were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 4 μm Fura-2/AM and 0.02% pluronic F127 (Invitrogen) for 1 h and then washed and incubated with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Islets were next transferred to a small volume chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) mounted on the microscope stage. INS-1 cells and islets were perifused with a gradient pump (Bio-Rad) and maintained at 37 °C. For INS-1 cells, 10 mm caffeine or 1 μm thapsigargin were used to activate ryanodine receptors or inhibit SERCA activity, respectively. Fura-2/AM fluorescence was measured with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. Images were captured using a Zeiss Z1 microscope with a ×10 or ×20 objective, and results were analyzed with Zen Blue software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). A D4ER adenovirus described previously was used for direct analysis of ER Ca2+ levels (45Ravier M.A. Daro D. Roma L.P. Jonas J.-C. Cheng-Xue R. Schuit F.C. Gilon P.

The probe was created by replacing the Ca2+ binding domain of the D1ER construct with D4 to provide lower Ca2+ affinity, with the new construct placed downstream of the rat insulin promoter. Briefly, INS-1 cells were cultured for 18 h with the D4ER adenovirus and siPdx-1 adenovirus or random siRNA adenovirus. Cells were then allowed to recover for 6 h. FLIM was carried out in accordance with a protocol published previously (47Day R.N. Measuring protein interactions using Forster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.Methods. 2014; 66: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, the Alba FastFLIM system (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL) was coupled to an Olympus IX71 microscope using a ×60 water-immersion lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Confocal scanning was controlled by Build 143 VistaVision software (ISS Inc.) at 530/43 nm acceptor and 480/40 nm receptor wavelengths. Regions of interest were selected with >75 count averages. The lifetime determination was obtained by analyzing the first 11–12 modulation frequencies (10–120 MHz). Efficiency of FRET was estimated next using the following equation: EFRET = 1 − (τDA / τD), where τD and τDA are the donor fluorescence lifetime obtained in the absence and presence of the acceptor, respectively. Our previous publication utilized luciferase constructs incorporating different lengths of the human SERCA2 promoter (19Kono T. Ahn G. Moss D.R. Gann L. Zarain-Herzberg A. Nishiki Y. Fueger P.T.

Approximately 2.0 × 104 NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast cells were seeded in 12-well plates 24 h before transfection. Next, 100 μg of plasmid was transfected into cells using Metafectene Pro transfection reagent (Biotex, Munich, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

The precise in vivo role of Rab11a in mouse embryonic development is unknown. We globally ablated Rab11a and examined the phenotypic and molecular outcomes in Rab11a(null) blastocysts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Using multiple trafficking assays and complementation analyses, we determined, among multiple important membrane-associated and soluble cargos, the critical contribution of Rab11a vesicular traffic to the secretion of multiple soluble MMPs. Rab11a(null) embryos were able to properly form normal blastocysts but died at peri-implantation stages. Our data suggest that Rab11a critically controls mouse blastocyst development and soluble matrix metalloproteinase secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2021384780,"Auxin is a central hormone involved in a wide range of developmental processes including the specification of vascular stem cells. Auxin Response Factors (ARF) are important actors of the auxin signalling pathway, regulating the transcription of auxin-responsive genes through direct binding to their promoters. The recent availability of the Eucalyptus grandis genome sequence allowed us to examine the characteristics and evolutionary history of this gene family in a woody plant of high economic importance. With 17 members, the E. grandis ARF gene family is slightly contracted, as compared to those of most angiosperms studied hitherto, lacking traces of duplication events. In silico analysis of alternative transcripts and gene truncation suggested that these two mechanisms were preeminent in shaping the functional diversity of the ARF family in Eucalyptus. Comparative phylogenetic analyses with genomes of other taxonomic lineages revealed the presence of a new ARF clade found preferentially in woody and/or perennial plants. High-throughput expression profiling among different organs and tissues and in response to environmental cues highlighted genes expressed in vascular cambium and/or developing xylem, responding dynamically to various environmental stimuli. Finally, this study allowed identification of three ARF candidates potentially involved in the auxin-regulated transcriptional program underlying wood formation."

Here, we describe a conserved role for class IIa HDACs in sustaining robust circadian behavioral rhythms in Drosophila and cellular rhythms in mammalian cells. In mouse fibroblasts, overexpression of HDAC5 severely disrupts transcriptional rhythms of core clock genes. HDAC5 overexpression decreases BMAL1 acetylation on Lys-537 and pharmacological inhibition of class IIa HDACs increases BMAL1 acetylation. Furthermore, we observe cyclical nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC5 in mouse fibroblasts that is characteristically circadian. Mutation of the Drosophila homolog HDAC4 impairs locomotor activity rhythms of flies and decreases period mRNA levels. RNAi-mediated knockdown of HDAC4 in Drosophila clock cells also dampens circadian function. Given that the localization of class IIa HDACs is signal-regulated and influenced by Ca2+ and cAMP signals, our findings offer a mechanism by which extracellular stimuli that generate these signals can feed into the molecular clock machinery.

Circadian rhythms govern diurnal variations in physiological functions, synchronizing behavior to the 24-h cyclical changes in our environment. At the molecular level, circadian clocks involve periodic changes in gene expression achieved by transcription-translation feedback loops whereby the protein products of transcribed genes auto-regulate their own transcription. In mammals, the core transcriptional circuit is comprised of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 that heterodimerize and activate transcription of Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes. PER/CRY proteins then repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of CLOCK-BMAL1 until they are degraded to allow a new cycle of transcription to begin (1Lowrey P.L. Takahashi J.S. Genetics of circadian rhythms in Mammalian model organisms.Adv. Genet. 2011; 74: 175-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In addition, an interlocking feedback loop regulates rhythmic expression of Bmal1 through opposing actions of the ROR and REV-ERB families of orphan nuclear receptors that activate and repress Bmal1 transcription, respectively, and whose expression is controlled by the core loop (1Lowrey P.L. Takahashi J.S. Genetics of circadian rhythms in Mammalian model organisms.Adv. Genet. 2011; 74: 175-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Preitner N. Damiola F. Lopez-Molina L. Zakany J.

This mechanism is conserved in the Drosophila core loop, where heterodimers of CLOCK and CYCLE induce transcription of period and timeless and the interlocking loop generates rhythmic changes in clock expression (4Zheng X. Sehgal A. Probing the relative importance of molecular oscillations in the circadian clock.Genetics. 2008; 178: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These transcriptional oscillations are regulated by many post-translational events, including reversible protein acetylation that controls circadian gene expression by impinging on both transcription factor activity and chromatin structure via modification of histone proteins. Rhythmic histone acetylation has been observed at promoters of core clock genes (5Etchegaray J.P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M.

Given that class IIa HDACs have the potential to influence rhythms of gene expression through their effects on both histones and non-histone proteins, we investigated their role in circadian function. Expression vectors for wild-type HDAC5-FLAG, wild-type HDAC5GFP (HDAC5WT), and GFP-fused HDAC5 mutant (HDAC5MUT) have been described previously (19Soriano F.X. Chawla S. Skehel P. Hardingham G.E.

Primary antibodies against phospho-HDAC4/5 Ser-246/259, acetyl histone H3(K9), histone H3, and the FLAG epitope were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-acetyl BMAL1(Lys-537) and anti-CLOCK were from Millipore, and anti-HDAC5 made in goat was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Glutamax, and penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Cells were transfected 24 h after plating using Gene Juice (Novagen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids were transfected with the indicated expression constructs in a ratio 7:2:1 expression vector:circadian (firefly) luciferase reporter:pRL-CMV (Renilla luciferase, Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was used as an internal control to correct for transfection efficiency. Cells were synchronized by replacing the medium with air medium and sealing the dishes prior to bioluminescence recordings, which were performed using custom-made photomultiplier assemblies housed in a 37 °C incubator as described previously (22O'Neill J.S.

A DAM2 Drosophila activity monitor system (Trikinetics, Inc., Waltham, MA) was used to record locomotor activity in 2-min bins. 1-to-4-day-old adult males were collected and loaded into activity tubes containing 5% sucrose in 1% agar food at one end. Flies were entrained to 12-h light/12-h dark cycles (LD) at 25°C for 3 days and then monitored in constant darkness for 7 to 10 days. Activity records were analyzed using ActogramJ (24Schmid B. Helfrich-Förster C. Yoshii T. A new ImageJ plug-in “ActogramJ” for chronobiological analyses.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2011; 26: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and circadian rhythmicity was assessed by Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of the constant darkness data. 2-to-4-day-old males were entrained for 3 days in LD conditions and then frozen at the indicated zeitgeber times. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase. 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the resulting cDNA was amplified with gene-specific primers for semi-quantitative PCR analysis. Primer sequences for Drosophila genes were as follows: period, 5′-CGTGCTGTGTCTGGTCCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACGGACAGCAATGGGAATAG-3′ (reverse); 18S rRNA, 5′-AACATGAACCTTATGGGACATGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGGTACAAGACCATACGATCTGC-3′ (reverse); and HDAC4, 5′-ACAACGCGTCCAGTAACTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAGTGTCGGGAATCTGACT-3′ (reverse). To assess the effect of HDAC inhibitors on BMAL1 acetylation, NIH3T3 cells transfected with BMAL1-Myc using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) were treated with indicated HDAC inhibitors 24 h after transfection. After 18 h, cells were lysed in hot SDS sample buffer. To assess the effect of HDAC5 expression on BMAL1 acetylation protein extracts were prepared from cells 40 h after transfection. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using pre-cast Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted using standard protocols. Band intensities were quantified with ImageJ software. Statistical significance was determined with a two-tailed paired Student's t test using the SPSS Statistical suite (IBM). HDAC5 subcellular localization was assessed by live cell imaging or immunofluorescence in near confluent cultures. For live cell imaging, HDAC5GFP-transfected NIH3T3 cells were imaged 24 h after transfection. Cells were imaged at 37 °C on a Zeiss laser scanning confocal system (Zeiss LSM 780 multiphoton) in medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin) that was replaced immediately before the start of the experiment. Images of GFP transfected cells were captured every 2 h for 2 consecutive days. For immunofluorescence, NIH3T3 cells were fixed at indicated times after synchronization of cultures with 10 μm forskolin. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for 20 min. Cells were subsequently washed in PBS followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Cells were incubated with phospho-HDAC4/5 antibody (diluted 1:100) overnight at 4°C. Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:500 and nuclei were visualized with a Hoechst stain. Images were captured on a Zeiss laser scanning confocal system, and immunofluorescence intensities were assessed using ImageJ software. Class IIa HDACs shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in response to extracellular signals. Their cytoplasmic localization is mediated by phosphorylation of two conserved serine residues in their N termini (serines 259 and 498 in HDAC5) that promotes their interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. To examine whether class IIa HDACs play a role in modulating circadian rhythms, we examined the effect of overexpressing both wild-type HDAC5 (HDAC5WT) and a phosphorylation-defective mutant (HDAC5MUT) (19Soriano F.X. Chawla S. Skehel P. Hardingham G.E. SMRT-mediated co shuttling enables export of class IIa HDACs independent of their CaM kinase phosphorylation sites.J. Neurochem. 2013; 124: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that is rendered constitutively nuclear due to mutation of the two conserved serines to alanines. Fig. 1 shows that the HDAC5WT is nuclear in untreated NIH3T3 cells and translocates to the cytoplasm when cells are stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, whereas HDAC5MUT is constitutively nuclear. We examined the transcriptional rhythms of Bmal1 and Per2 in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts by co-expressing HDAC5 with luciferase reporter plasmids where the luciferase gene is driven either by the Bmal1 promoter (Bmal1::luc) or the Per2 promoter (Per2::luc). Real-time bioluminescence measurements show that HDAC5 overexpression severely compromised Bmal1 transcriptional rhythms (Fig. 2A). Compared with control cells that displayed clear rhythmic Bmal1 luciferase luminescence oscillations for four cycles, circadian rhythms were lost after the first cycle in cells expressing HDAC5WT and completely abolished in cells expressing the constitutively nuclear HDAC5MUT (Fig. 2A). Both HDAC5WT and HDAC5MUT dampened the amplitude of Per2 transcriptional oscillations (Fig. 2, B and C) without affecting the period (unpaired t test compared with control, p > 0.5, n = 6). Expression of wild-type HDAC5 caused a significant reduction in the amplitude of Per2 luciferase bioluminescence in the first cycle, whereas there was little effect of HDAC5MUT expression. However, both the wild-type and mutant HDAC5 proteins caused a similar reduction in Per2 luciferase amplitude and magnitude in successive cycles with an increased rate of dampening (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2HDAC5 overexpression compromises normal circadian function in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. A, representative traces of real-time bioluminescence from cells transfected with Bmal1::luc alone (control) or together with wild-type HDAC5GFP (HDAC5WT) or the constitutively nuclear mutant (HDAC5MUT). Representative results from six independent repetitions are shown.

Because many components of the core transcriptional-translational feedback loop are conserved in Drosophila, we examined locomotor activity rhythms in Drosophila lines with reduced expression of the fly homolog HDAC4. We used a HDAC4 hypomorph mutant line (HDAC4KG09091) containing a P-element insertion in the 5′-UTR, which leads to reduced HDAC4 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). We assessed locomotor activity in HDAC4KG09091 flies that were out-crossed with the wild-type strain, Canton-S and compared these with control flies generated by crossing the ry506 strain with Canton-S. The mutant flies showed normal locomotor activity profiles and circadian rhythms in 12-h LD cycles (Fig. 3B). However, in free-running conditions of constant darkness, 41% of HDAC4 mutant flies lacked any rhythms. Fig. 4A shows representative actograms of arrhythmic HDAC4 mutant flies and control flies. Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis revealed that the remaining HDAC4 mutant flies that showed rhythmic behavior exhibited weak rhythms with a 60% decrease (Fig. 4B) in the power (a measure of the strength) of the rhythm. Although HDAC4 mutants displayed less robust rhythms, there was no significant difference in the period (Fig. 4C). To investigate whether HDAC4 knockdown in Drosophila affects the molecular clock that underlies behavioral rhythms, we tested the effects of HDAC4 gene disruption on period mRNA levels. HDAC4 mutant flies had reduced period mRNA expression in LD cycles at ZT16 but had comparable period expression at ZT8 (Fig. 4D).FIGURE 4Impaired circadian function in Drosophila lines with reduced levels of HDAC4 expression. A, representative double-plotted actograms of control and HDAC4KG09091 mutant male flies in constant darkness (DD). Control flies were generated by crossing ry506 virgins with Canton-S males, and test flies were produced by crossing HDAC4KG09091 virgins with Canton-S males. B, the strength of circadian activity rhythms is significantly reduced in HDAC4KG09091 mutant flies. The power was calculated from a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of 46 flies for each genotype. 41.3% of HDAC4KG09091 flies were arrhythmic so the power was calculated from analyses of flies with rhythmic locomotor activity profiles. Data are shown here as the mean ± S.E. (**, p < 0.01 two-tailed Student's t test). C, graph showing the average period (± S.E.) of control and HDAC4KG09091 mutant flies with rhythmic locomotor activity profiles. D, semi-quantitative PCR analysis of period (per) mRNA and 18S ribosomal RNA levels in control and HDAC4KG09091 mutant flies. Flies were collected at the indicated zeitgeber times (ZT) after 3 days in LD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because HDAC4 is involved in many functions, including differentiation of Drosophila muscle, we used the Gal4/UAS system to direct RNAi-mediated knockdown of HDAC4 expression. We crossed transgenic flies that express RNAi directed against HDAC4 driven by a UAS element (UAS-HDAC4RNAi) with those that express Gal4 driven by the timeless gene promoter (tim-Gal4) to specifically knockdown HDAC4 RNA levels in all clock cells. Table 1 shows that Drosophila with reduced expression of HDAC4 in clock cells have either disrupted rhythms (31% arrhythmic flies) or weaker circadian activity rhythms, but the period remains unaffected. This is consistent with the behavioral phenotype of HDAC4KG09091 mutant flies. Taken together, our experiments in mammalian cells and Drosophila lines indicate that interfering with normal levels of class IIa HDAC expression disrupts circadian function at both the cellular and behavioral level.TABLE 1HDAC4 knockdown reduces stringency of Drosophila locomotor activity rhythmsGenotype% ArrhythmicPeriodPowernhry506/+0.024.3 ± 0.06102 ± 19.446HDAC4KG09091/+41.324.2 ± 0.2344.2 ± 2.046UAS-HDAC4RNAi/+0.024.4 ± 0.11170.6 ± 21.416tim-Gal4/+0.023.8 ± 0.06106.6 ± 16.816UAS-HDAC4RNAi/tim-Gal431.224.2 ± 0.1769.7 ± 7.916Canton-S4.024.5 ± 0.0996.5 ± 10.225w11186.224.6 ± 0.30115.8 ± 28.916 Open table in a new tab We next investigated whether class IIa HDACs can, similar to SIRT1, influence acetylation of BMAL1. We treated BMAL1-Myc transfected NIH3T3 cells with various HDAC inhibitors and assessed BMAL1 acetylation using an antibody specific for lysine 537-acetylated BMAL1. Trichostatin A, a class I and class II HDAC inhibitor increased BMAL1 acetylation levels 1.85-fold (Fig. 5, A and B). Trichostatin A had a dramatic effect on histone H3 Lys-9 acetylation, increasing it by 6.9-fold, a consequence of its inhibitory action on class I HDACs. The class II-specific HDAC inhibitor MC1568 (25Nebbioso A. Manzo F. Miceli M. Conte M. Manente L. Baldi A. De Luca A. Rotili D. Valente S. Mai A. Usiello A. Gronemeyer H. Altucci L. Selective class II HDAC inhibitors impair myogenesis by modulating the stability and activity of HDAC MEF2 complexes.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) also increased BMAL1 acetylation, and the effect was similar to the class III HDAC inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM). MC1568 and NAM had an additive effect when applied together. MC1568 increased H3 Lys-9 acetylation to a lesser degree than trichostatin A, whereas NAM did not influence histone H3 acetylation. Although pharmacological inhibition of class II HDACs increased BMAL1 acetylation, we found that co-expression of either wild-type HDAC5 or the constitutively nuclear HDAC5 mutant with BMAL1-Myc decreased BMAL1 acetylation (Fig. 5, C and D). The wild-type and mutant HDAC5 were equally effective at deacetylating BMAL1. The subcellular localization of BMAL1 changes during circadian cycles, and the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of BMAL1 is abolished in fibroblasts with disrupted circadian clocks (26Tamaru T. Isojima Y. van der Horst G.T. Takei K. Nagai K. Takamatsu K. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and phosphorylation of BMAL1 are regulated by circadian clock in cultured fibroblasts.Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of HDAC5 co-expression on the subcellular localization of ectopically expressed BMAL1. In agreement with previous work (27Kwon I. Lee J. Chang S.H. Jung N.C. Lee B.J.

In contrast, the cellular localization of BMAL1 in HDAC5-expressing cells was heterogeneous, and BMAL1-Myc and HDAC5 could be found co-localized either in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5E, top panel), or in the nucleus (Fig. 5E, bottom panel), or in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 5E, middle panel). Interestingly, when BMAL1 and HDAC5 were exclusively nuclear or exclusively cytoplasmic BMAL1 acetylation was aboli"
https://openalex.org/W2061230329,"Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the unique ability to home toward injuries or tumor sites. We have previously shown that the tumor-tropic property is dependent on the intrinsic expression and activity of the matrix remodeling gene, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1). Herein, crosstalk between MMP-1/protease activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) and the G-protein coupled receptor stromal-derived growth factor 1 (SDF-1)/C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR-4) in facilitating cell migration was investigated. Gain-of-function and RNA interference (RNAi) technology were used to evaluate the interplay between the key players. The downstream effect on the tumor-tropic migration of MSCs was investigated using modified Boyden chamber assay. Neutralizing PAR-1 activation using monoclonal antibody and targeted knockdown of MMP-1 using RNAi resulted in decreased expression of SDF-1, which was not observed in control-RNAi-transfected cells. Overexpression of CXCR-4 failed to promote MSC migration; the percentage of migrated cells toward tumor cell conditioned medium was similar to the vector-transduced and the CXCR-4-transduced MSCs. Furthermore, inhibition of SDF-1/CXCR-4 signaling using AMD3100 reduced MSC migration through the deregulation of MMP-1 promoter activities, protein expression, and metalloproteinase activity. Collectively, our results showed that MMP-1-mediated MSC tumor tropism is dependent on crosstalk with the SDF-1/CXCR-4 axis."
https://openalex.org/W2041573975,"Myxococcus xanthus is a Gram-negative deltaproteobacterium that has evolved the ability to differentiate into metabolically quiescent spores that are resistant to heat and desiccation. An essential feature of the differentiation processes is the assembly of a rigid, cell wall-like spore coat on the surface of the outer membrane. In this study, we characterize the spore coat composition and describe the machinery necessary for secretion of spore coat material and its subsequent assembly into a stress-bearing matrix. Chemical analyses of isolated spore coat material indicate that the spore coat consists primarily of short 1-4- and 1-3-linked GalNAc polymers that lack significant glycosidic branching and may be connected by glycine peptides. We show that 1-4-linked glucose (Glc) is likely a minor component of the spore coat with the majority of the Glc arising from contamination with extracellular polysaccharides, O-antigen, or storage compounds. Neither of these structures is required for the formation of resistant spores. Our analyses indicate the GalNAc/Glc polymer and glycine are exported by the ExoA-I system, a Wzy-like polysaccharide synthesis and export machinery. Arrangement of the capsular-like polysaccharides into a rigid spore coat requires the NfsA-H proteins, members of which reside in either the cytoplasmic membrane (NfsD, -E, and -G) or outer membrane (NfsA, -B, and -C). The Nfs proteins function together to modulate the chain length of the surface polysaccharides, which is apparently necessary for their assembly into a stress-bearing matrix."

We examined the mechanism and physiological consequences of Pma1p mislocalization. Pma1p is ubiquitinated in vma mutants, and ubiquitination depends on the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p and the arrestin-related adaptor protein Rim8p. vma mutant strains containing rsp5 or rim8 mutations maintain Pma1p at the plasma membrane, suggesting that ubiquitination is required for Pma1p internalization. Acute inhibition of V-ATPase activity with concanamycin A triggers Pma1p ubiquitination and internalization. In an endocytosis-deficient mutant (end4Δ) Pma1p is ubiquitinated but retained at the plasma membrane during concanamycin A treatment. Consistent with specificity in signaling loss of V-ATPase activity to Pma1p, another plasma membrane transporter, Mup1p, is not internalized in a vma mutant, and loss of the Mup1p adaptor Art1p does not prevent Pma1p internalization in a vma mutant. Very poor growth of vma2 rsp5-1 and vma2 rim8Δ double mutants suggests that Pma1p internalization benefits the vma mutants. We hypothesize that loss of V-ATPase-mediated organelle acidification signals ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation of a portion of Pma1p as a means of balancing overall pH homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2019956571,"Adolescents living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) comprise approximately 12% of the HIV-positive population worldwide. HIV-positive adolescents experience a higher rate of clinical depression, a greater risk of sexual and drug abuse behaviors, and a decreased adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART). Using adolescent HIV-1 transgenic rats (HIV-1 tg) that display related immune response alterations and pathologies, this study tested the hypothesis that developmental expression of HIV-1-related proteins induces a depressive-like phenotype that parallels a decrease in hippocampal cell proliferation and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the hippocampus. Consistent with this hypothesis, adolescent HIV-1 tg rats demonstrated a depressive-like behavioral phenotype, had decreased levels of cell proliferation, and exhibited elevated expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp-1) in the hippocampus relative to controls. Subsequently, we tested the ability of meloxicam, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, to attenuate behavioral deficits via inflammatory mechanisms. Daily meloxicam treatments did not alter the behavioral profile despite effectively reducing hippocampal inflammatory gene expression. Together, these data support a biological basis for the co-morbid manifestation of depression in HIV-positive patients as early as in adolescence and suggest that modifications in behavior manifest independent of inflammatory activity in the hippocampus."

This property was also promoted by high osmotic potentials or molecular crowding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PvLEA6 protein is able to form soluble homo-oligomeric complexes that also show high levels of structural disorder.

https://openalex.org/W1978073748,"IGF2 is an autocrine ligand for the beta cell IGF1R receptor and GLP-1 increases the activity of this autocrine loop by enhancing IGF1R expression, a mechanism that mediates the trophic effects of GLP-1 on beta cell mass and function. Here, we investigated the regulation of IGF2 biosynthesis and secretion. We showed that glutamine rapidly and strongly induced IGF2 mRNA translation using reporter constructs transduced in MIN6 cells and primary islet cells. This was followed by rapid secretion of IGF2 via the regulated pathway, as revealed by the presence of mature IGF2 in insulin granule fractions and by inhibition of secretion by nimodipine and diazoxide. When maximally stimulated by glutamine, the amount of secreted IGF2 rapidly exceeded its initial intracellular pool and tolbutamide, and high K(+) increased IGF2 secretion only marginally. This indicates that the intracellular pool of IGF2 is small and that sustained secretion requires de novo synthesis. The stimulatory effect of glutamine necessitates its metabolism but not mTOR activation. Finally, exposure of insulinomas or beta cells to glutamine induced Akt phosphorylation, an effect that was dependent on IGF2 secretion, and reduced cytokine-induced apoptosis. Thus, glutamine controls the activity of the beta cell IGF2/IGF1R autocrine loop by increasing the biosynthesis and secretion of IGF2. This autocrine loop can thus integrate changes in feeding and metabolic state to adapt beta cell mass and function."
https://openalex.org/W1986385425,"Fourier transform infrared spectromicroscopy provides label-free imaging to detect the spatial distribution of the characteristic functional groups in proteins, lipids, phosphates, and carbohydrates simultaneously in individual DRG neurons. We have identified ring-shaped distributions of lipid and/or carbohydrate enrichment in subpopulations of neurons which has never before been reported. These distributions are ring-shaped within the cytoplasm and are likely representative of the endoplasmic reticulum. The prevalence of chemical ring subtypes differs between large- and small-diameter neurons. Peripheral inflammation increased the relative lipid content specifically in small-diameter neurons, many of which are nociceptive. Because many small-diameter neurons express an ion channel involved in inflammatory pain, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), we asked whether this increase in lipid content occurs in TRPA1-deficient (knock-out) neurons. No statistically significant change in lipid content occurred in TRPA1-deficient neurons, indicating that the inflammation-mediated increase in lipid content is largely dependent on TRPA1. Because TRPA1 is known to mediate mechanical and cold sensitization that accompanies peripheral inflammation, our findings may have important implications for a potential role of lipids in inflammatory pain."
https://openalex.org/W2030689683,"The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a Ca(2+)-permeable, nonselective cation channel mainly expressed in a subset of nociceptive neurons. TRPA1 functions as a cellular sensor detecting mechanical, chemical, and thermal stimuli. Because TRPA1 is considered to be a key player in nociception and inflammatory pain, TRPA1 antagonists have been developed as analgesic agents. Recently, by utilizing species differences, we identified the molecular basis of the antagonistic action of A967079, one of the most potent mammalian TRPA1 antagonists. Here, we show a unique effect of A967079 on TRPA1 from diverse vertebrate species, i.e. it acts as an agonist but not as an antagonist for chicken and frog TRPA1s. By characterizing chimeric channels of human and chicken TRPA1s, as well as point mutants, we found that a single specific amino acid residue located within the putative fifth transmembrane domain was involved in not only the stimulatory but also the inhibitory actions of A967079. AP18, structurally related to A967079, exerted similar pharmacological properties to A967079. Our findings and previous reports on species differences in the sensitivity to TRPA1 antagonists supply useful information in the search for novel analgesic medicines targeting TRPA1."
https://openalex.org/W2077132455,"The NAD-synthesizing enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is a critical survival factor for axons and its constant supply from neuronal cell bodies into axons is required for axon survival in primary culture neurites and axon extension in vivo. Recently, we showed that palmitoylation is necessary to target NMNAT2 to post-Golgi vesicles, thereby influencing its protein turnover and axon protective capacity. Here we find that NMNAT2 is a substrate for cytosolic thioesterases APT1 and APT2 and that palmitoylation/depalmitoylation dynamics are on a time scale similar to its short half-life. Interestingly, however, depalmitoylation does not release NMNAT2 from membranes. The mechanism of palmitoylation-independent membrane attachment appears to be mediated by the same minimal domain required for palmitoylation itself. Furthermore, we identify several zDHHC palmitoyltransferases that influence NMNAT2 palmitoylation and subcellular localization, among which a role for zDHHC17 (HIP14) in neuronal NMNAT2 palmitoylation is best supported by our data. These findings shed light on the enzymatic regulation of NMNAT2 palmitoylation and highlight individual thioesterases and palmitoyltransferases as potential targets to modulate NMNAT2-dependent axon survival."
https://openalex.org/W2090523994,"Objective To assess the prognostic and diagnostic value of whole blood impedance aggregometry in patients with sepsis and SIRS and to compare with whole blood parameters (platelet count, haemoglobin, haematocrit and white cell count). Methods We performed an observational, prospective study in the acute setting. Platelet function was determined using whole blood impedance aggregometry (multiplate) on admission to the Emergency Department or Intensive Care Unit and at 6 and 24 hours post admission. Platelet count, haemoglobin, haematocrit and white cell count were also determined. Results 106 adult patients that met SIRS and sepsis criteria were included. Platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock when compared to SIRS/uncomplicated sepsis (ADP: 90.7±37.6 vs 61.4±40.6; p<0.001, Arachadonic Acid 99.9±48.3 vs 66.3±50.2; p = 0.001, Collagen 102.6±33.0 vs 79.1±38.8; p = 0.001; SD ± mean)). Furthermore platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in the 28 day mortality group when compared with the survival group (Arachadonic Acid 58.8±47.7 vs 91.1±50.9; p<0.05, Collagen 36.6±36.6 vs 98.0±35.1; p = 0.001; SD ± mean)). However haemoglobin, haematocrit and platelet count were more effective at distinguishing between subgroups and were equally effective indicators of prognosis. Significant positive correlations were observed between whole blood impedance aggregometry and platelet count (ADP 0.588 p<0.0001, Arachadonic Acid 0.611 p<0.0001, Collagen 0.599 p<0.0001 (Pearson correlation)). Conclusions Reduced platelet aggregometry responses were not only significantly associated with morbidity and mortality in sepsis and SIRS patients, but also correlated with the different pathological groups. Whole blood aggregometry significantly correlated with platelet count, however, when we adjust for the different groups we investigated, the effect of platelet count appears to be non-significant."
https://openalex.org/W2087975176,"We investigated contemporary and historical influences on the pattern of genetic diversity of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). The study was conducted in northeastern Poland, a zone where vast areas of primeval forests are conserved and where the European roe deer was never driven to extinction. A total of 319 unique samples collected in three sampling areas were genotyped at 16 microsatellites and one fragment (610 bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. Genetic diversity was high, and a low degree of genetic differentiation among sampling areas was observed with both microsatellites and mtDNA. No evidence of genetic differentiation between roe deer inhabiting open fields and forested areas was found, indicating that the ability of the species to exploit these contrasting environments might be the result of its phenotypic plasticity. Half of the studied individuals carried an mtDNA haplotype that did not belong to C. capreolus, but to a related species that does not occur naturally in the area, the Siberian roe deer (C. pygargus). No differentiation between individuals with Siberian and European mtDNA haplotypes was detected at microsatellite loci. Introgression of mtDNA of Siberian roe deer into the genome of European roe deer has recently been detected in eastern Europe. Such introgression might be caused by human-mediated translocations of Siberian roe deer within the range of European roe deer or by natural hybridization between these species in the past."
https://openalex.org/W2014769550,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that regulate maturation of the interleukin 1β-related cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 through activation of the cysteine proteinase caspase-1. NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) protein is a key component of inflammasomes that assemble in response to a wide variety of endogenous and pathogen-derived danger signals. Activation of the NLRP3-inflammasome and subsequent secretion of IL-1β is highly regulated by at least three processes: transcriptional activation of both NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β genes, non-transcriptional priming of NLRP3, and final activation of NLRP3. NLRP3 is predominantly expressed in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the hematopoietic-restricted protein, G protein signaling modulator-3 (GPSM3), as a NLRP3-interacting protein and a negative regulator of IL-1β production triggered by NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activators. In monocytes, GPSM3 associates with the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain of NLRP3. Bone marrow-derived macrophages lacking GPSM3 expression exhibit an increase in NLRP3-dependent IL-1β, but not TNF-α, secretion. Furthermore, GPSM3-null mice have enhanced serum and peritoneal IL-1β production following Alum-induced peritonitis. Our findings suggest that GPSM3 acts as a direct negative regulator of NLRP3 function."
https://openalex.org/W1990877318,"Background Venous Thrombo-embolism (VTE – Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) – in traumatized patients causes significant morbidity and mortality. The current study evaluates the effectiveness of DVT surveillance in reducing PE, and performs a cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods All traumatized patients admitted to the adult ICU underwent twice weekly DVT surveillance by bilateral lower extremity venous Duplex examination (48-month surveillance period – SP). The rates of DVT and PE were recorded and compared to the rates observed in the 36-month pre-surveillance period (PSP). All patients in both periods received mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis unless contraindicated. Total costs – diagnostic, therapeutic and surveillance – for both periods were recorded and the incremental cost for each Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was calculated. Results 4234 patients were eligible (PSP – 1422 and SP – 2812). Rate of DVT in SP (2.8%) was significantly higher than in PSP (1.3%) – p<0.05, and rate of PE in SP (0.7%) was significantly lower than that in PSP (1.5%) – p<0.05. Logistic regression demonstrated that surveillance was an independent predictor of increased DVT detection (OR: 2.53 – CI: 1.462–4.378) and decreased PE incidence (OR: 0.487 – CI: 0.262–0.904). The incremental cost was $509,091/life saved in the base case, translating to $29,102/QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis over four of the parameters used in the model indicated that the incremental cost ranged from $18,661 to $48,821/QALY gained. Conclusions Surveillance of traumatized ICU patients increases DVT detection and reduces PE incidence. Costs in terms of QALY gained compares favorably with other interventions accepted by society."
https://openalex.org/W2082668109,"The circadian transcription factor CLOCK exhibits a circadian oscillation in its phosphorylation levels. Although it remains unclear whether this phosphorylation contributes to circadian rhythm generation, it has been suggested to be involved in transcriptional activity, intracellular localization, and degradative turnover of CLOCK. Here, we obtained direct evidence that CLOCK phosphorylation may be essential for autonomous circadian oscillation in clock gene expression. Importantly, we found that the circadian transcriptional repressors Cryptochrome (CRY) and Period (PER) showed an opposite effect on CLOCK phosphorylation; CRY impaired BMAL1-dependent CLOCK phosphorylation, whereas PER protected the phosphorylation against CRY. Interestingly, unlike PER1 and PER2, PER3 did not exert a protective action, which correlates with the phenotypic differences among mice lacking the Per genes. Further studies on the regulatory mechanism of CLOCK phosphorylation would thus lead to elucidation of the mechanism of CRY-mediated transcriptional repression and an understanding of the true role of PER in the negative feedback system."
https://openalex.org/W1976067397,"Insect odorant receptors are heteromeric odorant-gated cation channels comprising a conventional odorant-sensitive tuning receptor (ORx) and a highly conserved co-receptor known as Orco. Orco is found only in insects, and very little is known about its structure and the mechanism leading to channel activation. In the absence of an ORx, Orco forms homomeric channels that can be activated by a synthetic agonist, VUAA1. Drosophila melanogaster Orco (DmelOrco) contains eight cysteine amino acid residues, six of which are highly conserved. In this study, we replaced individual cysteine residues with serine or alanine and expressed Orco mutants in Flp-In 293 T-Rex cells. Changes in intracellular Ca(2+) levels were used to determine responses to VUAA1. Replacement of two cysteines (Cys-429 and Cys-449) in a predicted intracellular loop (ICL3), individually or together, gave variants that all showed similar increases in the rate of response and sensitivity to VUAA1 compared with wild-type DmelOrco. Kinetic modeling indicated that the response of the Orco mutants to VUAA1 was faster than wild-type Orco. The enhanced sensitivity and faster response of the Cys mutants was confirmed by whole-cell voltage clamp electrophysiology. In contrast to the results from direct agonist activation of Orco, the two cysteine replacement mutants when co-expressed with a tuning receptor (DmelOR22a) showed an ∼10-fold decrease in potency for activation by 2-methyl hexanoate. Our work has shown that intracellular loop 3 is important for Orco channel activation. Importantly, this study also suggests differences in the structural requirements for the activation of homomeric and heteromeric Orco channel complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1972818659,"We report the functional and temporal relationship between cellular phenotypes such as oxidative stress, p38MAPK-dependent responses and genomic instability persisting in the progeny of cells exposed to sparsely ionizing low-Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation such as X-rays or high-charge and high-energy (HZE) particle high-LET radiation such as (56)Fe ions. We found that exposure to low and high-LET radiation increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as a threshold-like response induced independently of radiation quality and dose. This response was sustained for two weeks, which is the period of time when genomic instability is evidenced by increased micronucleus formation frequency and DNA damage associated foci. Indicators for another persisting response sharing phenotypes with stress-induced senescence, including beta galactosidase induction, increased nuclear size, p38MAPK activation and IL-8 production, were induced in the absence of cell proliferation arrest during the first, but not the second week following exposure to high-LET radiation. This response was driven by a p38MAPK-dependent mechanism and was affected by radiation quality and dose. This stress response and elevation of ROS affected genomic instability by distinct pathways. Through interference with p38MAPK activity, we show that radiation-induced stress phenotypes promote genomic instability. In contrast, exposure to physiologically relevant doses of hydrogen peroxide or increasing endogenous ROS levels with a catalase inhibitor reduced the level of genomic instability. Our results implicate persistently elevated ROS following exposure to radiation as a factor contributing to genome stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2088460216,"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-containing bone grafts are useful regenerative materials for oral and maxillofacial surgery; however, several in vitro and in vivo studies previously reported cancer progression-related adverse effects caused by BMP-2. In this study, by quantifying the rhBMP-2 content released from bone grafts, the rhBMP-2 concentration that did not show cytotoxicity in each cell line was determined and applied to the in vitro monoculture or coculture model in the invasion assay. Our results showed that 1 ng/ml rhBMP-2, while not affecting cancer cell viability, significantly increased the invasion ability of the cancer cells cocultured with fibroblasts. Cocultured medium with rhBMP-2 also contained increased levels of matrix metalloproteinases. rhBMP-2-treated cocultured fibroblasts did not show a prominent difference in mRNA expression profile. Some cytokines, however, were detected in the conditioned medium by a human cytokine antibody array. Among them, the cancer invasion-related factor CCL5 was quantified by ELISA. Interestingly, CCL5 neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced the invasion of oral cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that 1 ng/ml rhBMP-2 may induce invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells by CCL5 release in coculture models. Therefore, we propose that a careful clinical examination before the use of rhBMP-2-containing biomaterials is indispensable for using rhBMP-2 treatment to prevent cancer progression."

Although in recent times an increasing number of examples have been found in bacteria the underlying mechanisms of their evolution are unknown. In this work we explore how selective pressure in a protein-coding sequence influences its overlapping genes in alternative reading frames. We model evolution using a time-continuous Markov process and derive the corresponding model for the remaining frames to quantify selection pressure and genetic noise. Our findings lead to the presumption that, once information is embedded in the reverse reading frame −2 (relative to the mother gene in +1) purifying selection in the protein-coding reading frame automatically protects the sequences in both frames. We also found that this coincides with the fact that the genetic noise measured using the conditional entropy is minimal in frame −2 under selection in the coding frame."
https://openalex.org/W2129367932,"The insect neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is a functional ortholog of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, the coupling factor of the mammalian circadian pacemaker. Despite of PDF's importance for synchronized circadian locomotor activity rhythms its signaling is not well understood. We studied PDF signaling in primary cell cultures of the accessory medulla, the circadian pacemaker of the Madeira cockroach. In Ca2+ imaging studies four types of PDF-responses were distinguished. In regularly bursting type 1 pacemakers PDF application resulted in dose-dependent long-lasting increases in Ca2+ baseline concentration and frequency of oscillating Ca2+ transients. Adenylyl cyclase antagonists prevented PDF-responses in type 1 cells, indicating that PDF signaled via elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. In contrast, in type 2 pacemakers PDF transiently raised intracellular Ca2+ levels even after blocking adenylyl cyclase activity. In patch clamp experiments the previously characterized types 1–4 could not be identified. Instead, PDF-responses were categorized according to ion channels affected. Application of PDF inhibited outward potassium or inward sodium currents, sometimes in the same neuron. In a comparison of Ca2+ imaging and patch clamp experiments we hypothesized that in type 1 cells PDF-dependent rises in cAMP concentrations block primarily outward K+ currents. Possibly, this PDF-dependent depolarization underlies PDF-dependent phase advances of pacemakers. Finally, we propose that PDF-dependent concomitant modulation of K+ and Na+ channels in coupled pacemakers causes ultradian membrane potential oscillations as prerequisite to efficient synchronization via resonance."
https://openalex.org/W2100825071,"Hummingbirds have developed a remarkable diversity of learned vocalizations, from single-note songs to phonologically and syntactically complex songs. In this study we evaluated if geographic song variation of wedge-tailed sabrewings (Campylopterus curvipennis) is correlated with genetic divergence, and examined processes that explain best the origin of intraspecific song variation. We contrasted estimates of genetic differentiation, genetic structure, and gene flow across leks from microsatellite loci of wedge-tailed sabrewings with measures for acoustic signals involved in mating derived from recordings of males singing at leks throughout eastern Mexico. We found a strong acoustic structure across leks and geography, where lek members had an exclusive assemblage of syllable types, differed in spectral and temporal measurements of song, and song sharing decreased with geographic distance. However, neutral genetic and song divergence were not correlated, and measures of genetic differentiation and migration estimates indicated gene flow across leks. The persistence of acoustic structuring in wedge-tailed sabrewings may thus best be explained by stochastic processes across leks, in which intraspecific vocal variation is maintained in the absence of genetic differentiation by postdispersal learning and social conditions, and by geographical isolation due to the accumulation of small differences, producing most dramatic changes between populations further apart."

Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is the cellular receptor for CpG-ODN in mammalian cells. The CpG-ODN with 18–24 deoxynucleotides that are in current use for human and mouse cells, however, have low activity with rabbit TLR9. Using a cell-based activation assay, we developed a type of CpG-ODN containing a GACGTT or AACGTT motif in 12 phosphorothioate-modified deoxynucleotides with potent stimulatory activity for rabbit TLR9. The developed CpG-ODN have higher activities than other developed CpG-ODN in eliciting antigen-nonspecific immune responses in rabbit splenocytes. When mixed with an NJ85 peptide derived from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, they had potent activities to boost an antigen-specific T cell activation and antibody production in rabbits. Compared to Freund’s adjuvant, the developed CpG-ODN are capable of boosting a potent and less toxic antibody response. The results of this study suggest that both the choice of CpG-motif and its length are important factors for CpG-ODN to effectively activate rabbit TLR9 mediated immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2125563442,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B usually exhibit a low response to treatment with interferon α (IFN-α). An alternative approach to increase the response rate of IFN-α might be to immunologically stimulate the host with glucocorticoids (GCs) before treatment with IFN-α, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that the GCs enhance IFN signaling by inducing S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) when hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication was effectively suppressed by IFN-α. Here, we investigated the effect of GCs and IFN-α on AdoMet production and methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) expression in vitro. Furthermore, we determined whether post-transcriptional regulation is involved in HBV-repressed MAT1A expression and AdoMet production induced by dexamethasone (Dex). We found that AdoMet homeostasis was disrupted by Dex and that Dex directly regulated MAT1A expression by enhancing the binding of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to the glucocorticoid-response element (GRE) of the MAT1A promoter. HBV reduced AdoMet production by increasing methylation at GRE sites within the MAT1A promoter. The X protein of hepatitis B virus led to hypermethylation in the MAT1A promoter by recruiting DNA methyltransferase 1, and it inhibited GR binding to the GRE in the MAT1A promoter. Dex could increase an antiviral effect by inducing AdoMet production via a positive feedback loop when HBV is effectively suppressed by IFN-α, and the mechanism that involves Dex-induced AdoMet could increase STAT1 methylation rather than STAT1 phosphorylation. These findings provide a possible mechanism by which GC-induced AdoMet enhances the antiviral activity of IFN-α by restoring STAT1 methylation in HBV-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077664470,"Reproductive biotechnologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) enable improved reproductive efficiency of animals. However, the birth rate of in vitro-derived embryos still lags behind that of their in vivo counterparts. Thus, it is critical to develop an accurate evaluation and prediction system of embryo competence, both for commercial purposes and for scientific research. Previous works have demonstrated that in vitro culture systems induce alterations in the relative abundance (RA) of diverse transcripts and thus compromise embryo quality. The aim of this work was to analyze the RA of a set of genes involved in cellular stress (heat shock protein 70-kDa, HSP70), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, Bip; proteasome subunit β5, PSMB5) and apoptosis (BCL-2 associated X protein, Bax; cysteine aspartate protease-3, Caspase-3) in bovine blastocysts produced by IVF or SCNT and compare it with that of their in vivo counterparts. Poly (A) + mRNA was isolated from three pools of 10 blastocysts per treatment and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The RA of three of the stress indicators analyzed (Bax, PSMB5 and Bip) was significantly increased in SCNT embryos as compared with that of in vivo-derived blastocysts. No significant differences were found in the RA of HSP70 and Caspase-3 gene transcripts. This study could potentially complement morphological analyses in the development of an effective and accurate technique for the diagnosis of embryo quality, ultimately aiding to improve the efficiency of assisted reproductive techniques (ART)."
https://openalex.org/W1982309838,"In groups of cooperatively foraging individuals, communication may improve the group's performance by directing foraging effort to where it is most useful. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) use a specialized dance to communicate the location of floral resources. Because honey bees dance longer for more rewarding resources, communication may shift the colony's foraging effort towards higher quality resources, and thus narrow the spectrum of resource types used. To test the hypothesis that dance communication changes how much honey bee colonies specialize on particular resources, we manipulated their ability to communicate location, and assessed the relative abundance of different pollen taxa they collected. This was repeated across five natural habitats that differed in floral species richness and spatial distribution. Contrary to expectation, impairing communication did not change the number or diversity of pollen (resource) types used by individual colonies per day. However, colonies with intact dance communication were more consistent in their resource use, while those with impaired communication were more likely to collect rare, novel pollen types. This suggests that communication plays an important role in shaping how much colonies invest in exploring new resources versus exploiting known ones. Furthermore, colonies that did more exploration also tended to collect less pollen overall, but only in environments with greater floral abundance per patch. In such environments, the ability to effectively exploit highly rewarding resources may be especially important-and dance communication may help colonies do just that. This could help explain how communication benefits honey bee colonies, and also why it does so only under certain environmental conditions."

It is well established that PLCε plays an important role in skin inflammation, such as that elicited by phorbol ester painting or ultraviolet irradiation and contact dermatitis that is mediated by T helper (Th) 1 cells, through upregulating inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. However, little is known about whether PLCε is involved in regulation of inflammation in the respiratory system, such as Th2-cells-mediated allergic asthma.We prepared a mouse model of allergic asthma using PLCε+/+ mice and PLCεΔX/ΔX mutant mice in which PLCε was catalytically-inactive. Mice with different PLCε genotypes were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) followed by the challenge with an OVA-containing aerosol to induce asthmatic response, which was assessed by analyzing airway hyper-responsiveness, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, inflammatory cytokine levels, and OVA-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) levels. Effects of PLCε genotype on cytokine production were also examined with primary-cultured bronchial epithelial cells.After OVA challenge, the OVA-immunized PLCεΔX/ΔX mice exhibited substantially attenuated airway hyper-responsiveness and broncial inflammation, which were accompanied by reduced Th2 cytokine content in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. In contrast, the serum levels of OVA-specific IgGs and IgE were not affected by the PLCε genotype, suggesting that sensitization was PLCε-independent. In the challenged mice, PLCε deficiency reduced proinflammatory cytokine production in the bronchial epithelial cells. Primary-cultured bronchial epithelial cells prepared from PLCεΔX/ΔX mice showed attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production when stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α, suggesting that reduced cytokine production in PLCεΔX/ΔX mice was due to cell-autonomous effect of PLCε deficiency.PLCε plays an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma through upregulating inflammatory cytokine production by the bronchial epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1994783135,"The fibroblast mitogen platelet-derived growth factor -BB (PDGF-BB) induces a transient expression of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 (also named Nur77, TR3 or NGFIB). The aim of the present study was to investigate the pathways through which NR4A1 is induced by PDGF-BB and its functional role. We demonstrate that in PDGF-BB stimulated NIH3T3 cells, the MEK1/2 inhibitor CI-1040 strongly represses NR4A1 expression, whereas Erk5 downregulation delays the expression, but does not block it. Moreover, we report that treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 suppresses NR4A1 mRNA and protein expression. The majority of NR4A1 in NIH3T3 was found to be localized in the cytoplasm and only a fraction was translocated to the nucleus after continued PDGF-BB treatment. Silencing NR4A1 slightly increased the proliferation rate of NIH3T3 cells; however, it did not affect the chemotactic or survival abilities conferred by PDGF-BB. Moreover, overexpression of NR4A1 promoted anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells and the glioblastoma cell lines U-105MG and U-251MG. Thus, whereas NR4A1, induced by PDGF-BB, suppresses cell growth on a solid surface, it increases anchorage-independent growth."
https://openalex.org/W1997471030,"Studies of associations between plasma GSH-Px activity and cardiovascular risk factors have been done in humans, and contradictory results have been reported. The aim of our study was to assess the association between the scavenger antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in plasma and the presence of novel and classical cardiovascular risk factors in elderly patients.We performed a cross-sectional study with baseline data from a subsample of the PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) study in Spain. Participants were 1,060 asymptomatic subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), aged 55 to 80, selected from 8 primary health care centers (PHCCs). We assessed classical CVD risk factors, plasma oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) using multilevel statistical procedures.Mean GSH-Px value was 612 U/L (SE: 12 U/L), with variation between PHCCs ranging from 549 to 674 U/L (Variance = 013.5; P<0.001). Between-participants variability within a PHCC accounted for 89% of the total variation. Both glucose and oxidized LDL were positively associated with GSH-Px activity after adjustment for possible confounder variables (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively).In a population at high cardiovascular risk, a positive linear association was observed between plasma GSH-Px activity and both glucose and ox-LDL levels. The high GSH-Px activity observed when an oxidative stress situation occurred, such as hyperglycemia and lipid oxidative damage, could be interpreted as a healthy defensive response against oxidative injury in our cardiovascular risk population."
https://openalex.org/W2040153874,"DNA phosphorothioate (PT) modification is a recently identified epigenetic modification that occurs in the sugar-phosphate backbone of prokaryotic DNA. Previous studies have demonstrated that DNA PT modification is governed by the five DndABCDE proteins in a sequence-selective and RP stereo-specific manner. Bacteria may have acquired this physiological modification along with dndFGH as a restriction-modification system. However, little is known about the biological function of Dnd proteins, especially the smallest protein, DndE, in the PT modification pathway. DndE was reported to be a DNA-binding protein with a preference for nicked dsDNA in vitro; the binding of DndE to DNA occurs via six positively charged lysine residues on its surface. The substitution of these key lysine residues significantly decreased the DNA binding affinities of DndE proteins to undetectable levels. In this study, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis of dndE on a plasmid and measured DNA PT modifications under physiological conditions by mass spectrometry. We observed distinctive differences from the in vitro binding assays. Several mutants with lysine residues mutated to alanine decreased the total frequency of PT modifications, but none of the mutants completely eliminated PT modification. Our results suggest that the nicked dsDNA-binding capacity of DndE may not be crucial for PT modification and/or that DndE may have other biological functions in addition to binding to dsDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2005510044,"Assimilation of nitrogen is an essential biological process for plant growth and productivity. Here we show that three chloroplast enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation, glutamate synthase (GOGAT), nitrite reductase (NiR) and glutamine synthetase (GS), separately assemble into distinct protein complexes in spinach chloroplasts, as analyzed by western blots under blue native electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). GOGAT and NiR were present not only as monomers, but also as novel complexes with a discrete size (730 kDa) and multiple sizes (>120 kDa), respectively, in the stromal fraction of chloroplasts. These complexes showed the same mobility as each monomer on two-dimensional (2D) SDS-PAGE after BN-PAGE. The 730 kDa complex containing GOGAT dissociated into monomers, and multiple complexes of NiR reversibly converted into monomers, in response to the changes in the pH of the stromal solvent. On the other hand, the bands detected by anti-GS antibody were present not only in stroma as a conventional decameric holoenzyme complex of 420 kDa, but also in thylakoids as a novel complex of 560 kDa. The polypeptide in the 560 kDa complex showed slower mobility than that of the 420 kDa complex on the 2D SDS-PAGE, implying the assembly of distinct GS isoforms or a post-translational modification of the same GS protein. The function of these multiple complexes was evaluated by in-gel GS activity under native conditions and by the binding ability of NiR and GOGAT with their physiological electron donor, ferredoxin. The results indicate that these multiplicities in size and localization of the three nitrogen assimilatory enzymes may be involved in the physiological regulation of their enzyme function, in a similar way as recently described cases of carbon assimilatory enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2080558659,"The heart is the first organ required to function during embryonic development and is absolutely necessary for embryo survival. Cardiac activity is dependent on both the sinoatrial node (SAN), which is the pacemaker of heart's electrical activity, and the cardiac conduction system which transduces the electrical signal though the heart tissue, leading to heart muscle contractions. Defects in the development of cardiac electrical function may lead to severe heart disorders. The Erbb2 (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) gene encodes a member of the EGF receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The Erbb2 receptor lacks ligand-binding activity but forms heterodimers with other EGF receptors, stabilising their ligand binding and enhancing kinase-mediated activation of downstream signalling pathways. Erbb2 is absolutely necessary in normal embryonic development and homozygous mouse knock-out Erbb2 embryos die at embryonic day (E)10.5 due to severe cardiac defects. We have isolated a mouse line, l11Jus8, from a random chemical mutagenesis screen, which carries a hypomorphic missense mutation in the Erbb2 gene. Homozygous mutant embryos exhibit embryonic lethality by E12.5-13. The l11Jus8 mutants display cardiac haemorrhage and a failure of atrial function due to defects in atrial electrical signal propagation, leading to an atrial-specific conduction block, which does not affect ventricular conduction. The l11Jus8 mutant phenotype is distinct from those reported for Erbb2 knockout mouse mutants. Thus, the l11Jus8 mouse reveals a novel function of Erbb2 during atrial conduction system development, which when disrupted causes death at mid-gestation."
https://openalex.org/W1992390343,"This study was designed to establish a low dose salicylate-induced tinnitus rat model and to investigate whether central or peripheral auditory system is involved in tinnitus.Lick suppression ratio (R), lick count and lick latency of conditioned rats in salicylate group (120 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and saline group were first compared. Bilateral auditory nerves were ablated in unconditioned rats and lick count and lick latency were compared before and after ablation. The ablation was then performed in conditioned rats and lick count and lick latency were compared between salicylate group and saline group and between ablated and unablated salicylate groups.Both the R value and the lick count in salicylate group were significantly higher than those in saline group and lick latency in salicylate group was significantly shorter than that in saline group. No significant changes were observed in lick count and lick latency before and after ablation. After ablation, lick count and lick latency in salicylate group were significantly higher and shorter respectively than those in saline group, but they were significantly lower and longer respectively than those in unablated salicylate group.A low dose of salicylate (120 mg/kg) can induce tinnitus in rats and both central and peripheral auditory systems participate in the generation of salicylate-induced tinnitus."
https://openalex.org/W2048544033,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is an idiopathic disease that results from increased fibrosis of the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT). A recent study found overexpression of both transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the SSCT of CTS patients. This study investigated TGF-β and CTGF expression in a rabbit model of CTS, in which SSCT fibrosis is induced by a surgical injury. Levels of TGF-β1 and CTGF at 6, 12, 24 weeks after injury were determined by immunohistochemistry A significant increase in TGF-β1 and a concomitant significant increase in CTGF were found at 6 weeks, in addition to higher cell density compared to normal (all p<0.05), Interestingly, CTGF expression was reduced at 12 and 24 weeks, suggesting that an initial insult results in a time limited response. We conclude that this rabbit model mimics the fibrosis found in human CTS, and may be useful to study pathogenetic mechanisms of CTS in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1977186407,"Predicting protein domains is essential for understanding a protein's function at the molecular level. However, up till now, there has been no direct and straightforward method for predicting protein domains in species without a reference genome sequence. In this study, we developed a functionality with a set of programs that can predict protein domains directly from genomic sequence data without a reference genome. Using whole genome sequence data, the programming functionality mainly comprised DNA assembly in combination with next-generation sequencing (NGS) assembly methods and traditional methods, peptide prediction and protein domain prediction. The proposed new functionality avoids problems associated with de novo assembly due to micro reads and small single repeats. Furthermore, we applied our functionality for the prediction of leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains in four species of Ficus with no reference genome, based on NGS genomic data. We found that the LRRNT_2 and LRR_8 domains are related to plant transpiration efficiency, as indicated by the stomata index, in the four species of Ficus. The programming functionality established in this study provides new insights for protein domain prediction, which is particularly timely in the current age of NGS data expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2059845935,"The present study examined the effects of spatial sound-source density and reverberation on the spatiotemporal window for audio-visual motion coherence. Three different acoustic stimuli were generated in Virtual Auditory Space: two acoustically “dry” stimuli via the measurement of anechoic head-related impulse responses recorded at either 1° or 5° spatial intervals (Experiment 1), and a reverberant stimulus rendered from binaural room impulse responses recorded at 5° intervals in situ in order to capture reverberant acoustics in addition to head-related cues (Experiment 2). A moving visual stimulus with invariant localization cues was generated by sequentially activating LED's along the same radial path as the virtual auditory motion. Stimuli were presented at 25°/s, 50°/s and 100°/s with a random spatial offset between audition and vision. In a 2AFC task, subjects made a judgment of the leading modality (auditory or visual). No significant differences were observed in the spatial threshold based on the point of subjective equivalence (PSE) or the slope of psychometric functions (β) across all three acoustic conditions. Additionally, both the PSE and β did not significantly differ across velocity, suggesting a fixed spatial window of audio-visual separation. Findings suggest that there was no loss in spatial information accompanying the reduction in spatial cues and reverberation levels tested, and establish a perceptual measure for assessing the veracity of motion generated from discrete locations and in echoic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2015158134,"Accumulating evidence indicates that both defects in Treg numbers and/or function as well as resistance of effector T cells to suppression may contribute to the development of human chronic inflammatory diseases. However, which mechanism involved in the progression of atherosclerosis remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the production and function of CD4⁺ inflammatory and regulatory T cells in atherosclerosis-prone mice. We found that the hyperactivity and unresponsiveness to Treg-mediated suppression of inflammatory CD4⁺ T cells occurred in the progression of atherosclerosis, though Treg cells were present in very large numbers and fully functional. We further found that Gr-1⁺CD11b⁺ immature myeloid cells were significantly accumulated in atherosclerotic Apo E⁻/⁻ mice, and they promoted resistance of inflammatory CD4⁺ T cells to Treg-mediated suppression in vitro and in vivo. we further confirmed that Gr-1⁺CD11b⁺ immature myeloid cells produced high level of interleukin 6 which was at least partially responsible for inducing unresponsiveness of inflammatory CD4⁺ T cells to suppression via activation of Jak/Stat signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings might provide new insights to explore potential targets for immune therapeutic intervention in atherosclerosis."
