https://openalex.org/W2978131638,"The responses of CD8+ T cells to hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B range from dysfunction to differentiation into effector cells, but the mechanisms that underlie these distinct outcomes remain poorly understood. Here we show that priming by Kupffer cells, which are not natural targets of hepatitis B, leads to differentiation of CD8+ T cells into effector cells that form dense, extravascular clusters of immotile cells scattered throughout the liver. By contrast, priming by hepatocytes, which are natural targets of hepatitis B, leads to local activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells but not to differentiation into effector cells; these cells form loose, intravascular clusters of motile cells that coalesce around portal tracts. Transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses reveal unique features of these dysfunctional CD8+ T cells, with limited overlap with those of exhausted or tolerant T cells; accordingly, CD8+ T cells primed by hepatocytes cannot be rescued by treatment with anti-PD-L1, but instead respond to IL-2. These findings suggest immunotherapeutic strategies against chronic hepatitis B infection."
https://openalex.org/W2978006966,"tRNA fragments (tRFs) and tRNA halves have been implicated in various cellular processes, including gene silencing, translation, stress granule assembly, cell differentiation, retrotransposon activity, symbiosis, apoptosis, and more. Overexpressed angiogenin (ANG) cleaves tRNA anticodons and produces tRNA halves similar to those produced in response to stress. However, it is not clear whether endogenous ANG is essential for producing the stress-induced tRNA halves. It is also not clear whether smaller tRFs are generated from the tRNA halves. Here, using global short RNA-Seq approach, we found that ANG overexpression selectively cleaves a subset of tRNAs, including tRNAGlu, tRNAGly, tRNALys, tRNAVal, tRNAHis, tRNAAsp, and tRNASeC to produce tRNA halves and tRF-5s that are 26–30 bases long. Surprisingly, ANG knockout revealed that the majority of stress-induced tRNA halves, except for the 5′ half from tRNAHisGTG and the 3′ half from tRNAAspGTC, are ANG independent, suggesting there are other RNases that produce tRNA halves. We also found that the 17–25 bases–long tRF-3s and tRF-5s that could enter into Argonaute complexes are not induced by ANG overexpression, suggesting that they are generated independently from tRNA halves. Consistent with this, ANG knockout did not decrease tRF-3 levels or gene-silencing activity. We conclude that ANG cleaves specific tRNAs and is not the only RNase that creates tRNA halves and that the shorter tRFs are not generated from the tRNA halves or from independent tRNA cleavage by ANG. tRNA fragments (tRFs) and tRNA halves have been implicated in various cellular processes, including gene silencing, translation, stress granule assembly, cell differentiation, retrotransposon activity, symbiosis, apoptosis, and more.

One report also suggests stress-activated ANG could cleave the CCA at the 3′ end of mature tRNAs quickly, even before the cleavage at the anticodon loop (42Czech A. Wende S. Mörl M. Pan T. Ignatova Z. Reversible and rapid transfer-RNA deactivation as a mechanism of translational repression in stress.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9 (24009533): e100376710.1371/journal.pgen.1003767Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Most of these previous studies quantified the effect of ANG cleavage only on a subset of tRNAs by Northern blot analysis, so a global view is still lacking. On the other hand, biogenesis of stress-independent tRFs is poorly known, except a recent report of ANG-dependent tRNA halves in nonstressed sex hormone–positive cells (43Honda S. Loher P. Shigematsu M. Palazzo J.P. Suzuki R. Imoto I. Rigoutsos I. Kirino Y. Sex hormone-dependent tRNA halves enhance cell proliferation in breast and prostate cancers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We have shown that most 17- to 25-nt tRF-3s are generated by uncharacterized Dicer-independent pathways (5Kumar P. Anaya J. Mudunuri S.B. Dutta A.

This is a possibility, especially considering that ANG could directly generate tRF-3 as suggested by in vitro reactions (44Li Z. Ender C. Meister G. Moore P.S. Chang Y. John B. Extensive terminal and asymmetric processing of small RNAs from rRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, and tRNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22492706): 6787-679910.1093/nar/gks307Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or detach amino acids from tRNA 3′ CCA end (42Czech A.

In this report, we systematically characterize angiogenin’s role in tRNA cleavage in nonstressed and stressed human cell lines. We test whether ANG is sufficient and/or required for tRNA cleavage. By small RNA-Seq, we profiled the global tRNA cleavage pattern by ANG overexpression, which leads to specific increase of both tRNA 5′ halves and 3′ halves. Although increase of tRNA 5′ halves correlates with an increase in the long (26–30 nt) tRF-5s, tRF-1s, short (17–25 nt) tRF-5s and tRF-3s were unaffected by ANG cleavage. Surprisingly, the majority of tRFs were unaffected by ANG knockout and only a few specific tRNA halves (5′ tRNAHisGTG and 3′ tRNAAspGTC) were decreased by loss of ANG. CRISPR knockout of ANG cells still displayed arsenite stress-induced tRNA anticodon cleavage and translational arrest, suggesting other RNase(s) contribute extensively to the overall stress-induced tRNA cleavage. We conclude that human angiogenin is sufficient but not essential for tRNA anticodon cleavage and that the short tRF-3s and tRF-5s are generated by ANG-independent mechanisms. To identify which tRNAs are cleaved and how by ANG, we overexpressed full-length human ANG in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A). Western blotting in these cells confirms that a 14-kDa mature ANG protein is overexpressed in the cell lysate (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). We noted ANG mRNA was overexpressed over 500-fold (Fig. S1A), whereas ANG protein appears to be overexpressed in cell lysates to ∼10- to 20-fold (Fig. 1B), which could be because of the secretion of ANG protein from the cells. SYBR Gold staining of total RNA detects RNA bands around 35 and 40 nucleotides upon ANG overexpression (Fig. 1B), consistent with the tRNA halves in previous reports (17Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F.

Sequencing of tRNA fragments is known to be sensitive to both terminal and internal modifications on the RNA molecules. To make quantitative comparison of tRNA fragments between two conditions, we assumed the cloning efficiency for each tRF is not changed by different conditions of cell treatment. This is why we compare relative levels of the same tRF across conditions, rather than the levels of different tRFs in a given condition. ANG overexpression specifically increased counts of fragments derived from tRNAs, and fragments from ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) to a lesser extent (Fig. 1C). The slight i"

We developed questions designed to assess the extent and reasons for substitution of marijuana for opioids. We examined opioid substitution among respondents with a history of ever using marijuana who used opioids in the past 12 months. There were 9,003 respondents, corresponding to a 55.3% response rate. The mean age was 48 years. Among the 5% (n = 486) who reported ever using marijuana and using opioids in the past year, 43% used opioids daily, and 23% reported current (past 30 day) marijuana use. Forty-one percent reported a decrease or cessation of opioid use due to marijuana use; 46% reported no change in opioid use; and 8% reported an increase in opioid use. We found that a substantial number of US adults reported that they substituted marijuana for opioids."
https://openalex.org/W4205285591,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a malignant pediatric brain tumor for which new therapies are urgently needed. We demonstrate that treatment with EPZ-6438 (Tazemetostat), an enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitor approved for clinical trials, blocks MB cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and prolongs survival in orthotopic xenograft models. We show that the therapeutic effect is dependent on epigenetic reactivation of adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor B1 (BAI1/ADGRB1), a tumor suppressor that controls p53 stability by blocking Mdm2. Histone 3 trimethylated on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a marker of silent chromatin conformation is present at the ADGRB1 promoter, and inhibition of EZH2, the catalytic component of the Polycomb Repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that methylates H3K27, switches the gene into an active chromatin status and reactivates BAI1 expression. Mechanistically, targeting EZH2 promotes transition from H3K27me3 to H3K27ac at the promoter, recruits the C/EBPβ (CREB-binding protein) and CBP transcription factors and activates ADGRB1 gene transcription. Taken together, our results identify key molecular players that regulate ADGRB1 gene expression in MB, demonstrate that reactivation of BAI1 expression underlies EPZ-6438 antitumorigenic action, and provide preclinical proof-of-principle evidence for targeting EZH2 in patients with MB."
https://openalex.org/W2978206657,"Background The processes that result in progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain enigmatic. Moreover, the course of this disease can be highly variable and difficult to accurately predict. We hypothesized analyses of body mass index (BMI), a simple, routine clinical measure, may also have prognostic value in these patients, and might provide mechanistic insights. We investigated the associations of BMI changes with outcome, plasma adipokines, and adaptive immune activation among IPF patients. Methods Data were analyzed in an IPF discovery cohort (n = 131) from the University of Pittsburgh, and findings confirmed in patients from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (n = 148). Plasma adipokines were measured by ELISA and T-cell phenotypes determined by flow cytometry. Results Transplant-free one-year survivals in subjects with the greatest rates of BMI decrements, as percentages of initial BMI (>0.68%/month), were worse than among those with more stable BMI in both discovery (HR = 1.8, 95%CI = 1.1–3.2, p = 0.038) and replication cohorts (HR = 2.5, 95%CI = 1.2–5.2, p = 0.02), when adjusted for age, baseline BMI, and pulmonary function. BMI decrements >0.68%/month were also associated with greater mortality after later lung transplantations (HR = 4.6, 95%CI = 1.7–12.5, p = 0.003). Circulating leptin and adiponectin levels correlated with BMI, but neither adipokine was prognostic per se. BMI decrements were significantly associated with increased proportions of circulating end-differentiated (CD28null) CD4 T-cells (CD28%), a validated marker of repetitive T-cell activation and IPF prognoses. Conclusions IPF patients with greatest BMI decrements had worse outcomes, and this effect persisted after lung transplantation. Weight loss in these patients is a harbinger of poor prognoses, and may reflect an underlying systemic process, such as adaptive immune activation."

Mutations in the β-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene (β-MyHC) are a major cause of HCM, but the specific mechanistic changes to myosin function that lead to this disease remain incompletely understood. Predicting the severity of any β-MyHC mutation is hindered by a lack of detailed examinations at the molecular level.

Here, for the early and late onset HCM mutations, we show that the kinetic parameters of mutations also do not have a “unifying” disruption of the cycle. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not detect any strong differences in kinetic parameters between mutations seen in late onset versus early onset patients, or among mutations in the different structural domains of the motor that account for the difference in the timing of pathological manifestation. We produced recombinant mutant and WT human myosin motors in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells, performed extensive kinetic analysis, and evaluated the severity of these mutations based on alterations to the cross-bridge cycle. We specifically focused on the cross-bridge kinetics of the motor domain region utilizing the short subfragment 1 (sS1, corresponding to residues 1–808, Fig. S1). Steady-state ATPase data for 4 of the mutations examined here H251N, R719W, R723G, and G741R, have already been published (15Kawana M. Sarkar S.S. Sutton S. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A.

These are listed in Table 1 together with the kcat values for the remaining 4 mutations. The error on these measurements is of the order of 10% and 3 of the mutations, the early onset V763M and the late onset R719W and R723G, differ from WT by less than 5%. The kcat for G741R is less than 10% lower than WT. Three other mutations, H251N, D382Y, and P710R, differ significantly from WT. The early onset H251N and D382Y are higher than WT by 24 and 20%, respectively, whereas P710R is 39% lower than WT. Thus, there is no common pattern of change in the kcat values for these HCM mutations and no difference in pattern between early and late onset groups. This lack of common patterns led us to focus on the transient kinetic analysis that can reveal more detail about how mutations change the ATPase cycle.Table 1Kinetic parameters for β-WT and 8 HCM mutations Open table in a new tab Considerable amounts of pre–steady-state kinetic data have been collected for a number of DCM and HCM mutations in the β-MyHC motor domain.

We have taken the same approach to understand the impact of this set of HCM mutations and to compare with the results of previous studies. Details of individual measurements and the evaluation of data quality are presented in the supporting information (Fig. S2–S6). Here we focus on what effect each mutation has on the behavior of the cycle. For every mutant, each measurement was made at least 3 times with a minimum of 2 independent protein preparations. In general, all parameters were measured to a precision of better than 20% and in most cases better than 10%. Given this level of sensitivity, we assume any change of less than 20% is not significant. The data are interpreted in terms of the 8-step ATP-driven cross-bridge cycle that we have used previously (Fig. 2). Red shades indicate detached cross-bridges, yellow shades are weakly-attached, and blue shades represent strongly-attached force-holding cross-bridges. Table 1 shows the mean values and errors of the actin and nucleotide-binding experiments for the steps in the cycle that are accessible, together with the ATPase parameters. To make the overall pattern of the induced changes clearer, the percent changes relative to WT are color coded in Table 1. The data are also summarized in Fig. 3, where the percentage differences in each parameter relative to WT are plotted.Figure 3Summary of percentage differences in kinetic parameters of HCM mutations relative to WT. A, % change for measured dissociation or equilibrium constants. Also included is the Kapp value from ATPase analysis. B, % change of several measured rate constants. Color-coded to match the parameter to each HCM mutation. The dashed lines represent ±20% change in the parameter considered to be the precision of each measurement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Even though the reactions are not part of the normal cycle, nucleotide binding to the motor in the absence of actin is measured to understand how the nucleotide-binding pocket and the weakly-attached actin states might be affected by mutations. This process can be important to understand the cycle of the second myosin head, whereas the other can be attached to actin. The affinity of ATP for sS1 is weakened >2-fold for 2 mutations (P710R and G741R). All other mutations were 27–73% weaker except R719W, which was indistinguishable from WT. In contrast, most mutants bound ADP >2-fold tighter, with the exception of V763M (just less than 2-fold tighter) and P710R (6-fold weaker). Thus, no simple pattern of behavior was apparent for the sS1 in the absence of actin, but most mutations significantly affected nucleotide binding. The darker color coding of the data in Table 1 shows the parameters that change >2-fold (dark blue decrease, dark orange increase) and indicate that a large number of parameters have been affected, and at least one parameter for each mutant. Thus, the changes observed are not minor, despite relatively small changes in the value of the steady-state kcat. Fig. 3A shows that in general, the value of KT (the affinity of ATP for acto·sS1) measured at 10 °C where it is well-defined, KA (the affinity of actin for sS1), and KDA (the affinity of actin for sS1·ADP) have tighter binding. For KT this is >20% tighter, but none is as much as 2-fold tighter. For KDA the affinities are mostly >2-fold tighter with V763M, G741R, and P710R >4-fold tighter, whereas the data for KA is much more variable. The affinity of ADP for acto·sS1 is >2-fold weaker in 5 cases. R723G is an exception for both the KA and ADP affinity for acto·sS1 parameters, but there is a general pattern. Fig. 3B shows changes in measured rate constants. There is some consistent behavior, but it is not uniform for all mutations. The maximum rate constant for sS1 detachment from actin upon binding ATP (k+T*) is generally slower (20–70%) and the rate constant for ADP binding to acto·sS1 is also generally slower (30–70%) with the exception of R723G, which is increased by 70%. All other rate constants had variable changes or none at all. This highly variable pattern was also seen for the set of DCM mutations we previously reported (27Ujfalusi Z. Vera C.D. Mijailovich S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2978808987,"Influenza virus causes a heterogeneous respiratory infectious disease ranging from self-limiting symptoms to non-resolving pathology in the lungs. Worldwide, seasonal influenza infections claim ~500,000 lives annually. Recent reports describe pathologic pulmonary sequelae that result in remodeling the architecture of lung parenchyma following respiratory infections. These dysfunctional recovery processes that disproportionately impact the elderly have been understudied. Macrophages are involved in tissue remodeling and are critical for survival of severe influenza infection. Here, we found intrinsic deficiency of the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ in myeloid cells delayed the resolution of pulmonary inflammation following influenza infection. Mice with myeloid cell-specific PPAR-γ deficiency subsequently presented with increased influenza-induced deposition of pulmonary collagen compared to control mice. This dysfunctional lung remodeling was progressive and sustained for at least 3 months following infection of mice with myeloid PPAR-γ deficiency. These progressive changes were accompanied by a pro-fibrotic gene signature from lung macrophages and preceded by deficiencies in activation of genes involved with damage repair. Importantly similar aberrant gene expression patterns were also found in a secondary analysis of a study where macrophages were isolated from patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Quite unexpectedly, mice with PPAR-γ deficient macrophages were more resistant to bleomycin-induced weight loss whereas extracellular matrix deposition was unaffected compared to controls. Therefore PPAR-γ expression in macrophages may be a pathogen-specific limiter of organ recovery rather than a ubiquitous effector pathway in response to generic damage."

Materials and methods Protein expression levels of PD-L1 were determined by immunohistochemistry assay. Stromal type was classified based on the maturity of the tumor stroma. Results Different subtypes of breast cancer had distinct stromal types. Tumors from patients with mature stroma had lower pathological N stage and AJCC stage, more frequent high p53 expression and positive stromal PD-L1 staining. Hormone receptor negative patients had higher frequency of positive stromal PD-L1 staining. Stromal PD-L1 status was also associated with different breast cancer subtypes and EGFR expression level. Importantly, our data revealed that stromal types and stromal PD-L1 status were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion This study highlighted the importance of stromal types and stromal PD-L1 status in determining clinical outcomes in patients with breast cancer, and suggested that stromal type classification might be readily incorporated into routine clinical risk assessment following curative resection or optimal therapeutic design."

This study aimed to determine adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes among women admitted with HDPs in a tertiary hospital in Ghana, and directly compare these outcomes among women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and those with chronic/gestational hypertension. Methods An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among women who were admitted with HDPs to Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital from July 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. Data was collected on their socio-demographic and reproductive characteristics using a pretested structured questionnaire and review of their antenatal records. Crude and adjusted relative risks (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared using multivariable binomial regression. P ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 451 women with HDPs were studied: 5.3%, 32.4%, 48.8% and 13.5% had chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia respectively. Over 80% were either referrals or “self-referred” from other facilities. Overall, 87% had adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes. Women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia were at increased risks of caesarean section (adjusted RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01–1.87), preterm delivery at <34 weeks’ gestation (adjusted RR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.40–5.36) and preterm delivery at <37 weeks’ gestation (adjusted RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.25–2.85), compared to women with chronic/gestational hypertension. Conclusion Women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia were at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcome compared to those with chronic/gestational hypertension. Strategies for prevention and management of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia to improve pregnancy outcomes are required in this major maternity care centre."

DNMT3A activity is essential for normal development, and its dysfunction has been linked to developmental disorders and cancer. DNMT3A is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies with the majority of mutations occurring at Arg-882, where R882H mutations are most frequent. The R882H mutation causes a reduction in DNA methyltransferase activity and hypomethylation at differentially-methylated regions within the genome, ultimately preventing hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and leading to leukemogenesis. Although the means by which the R882H DNMT3A mutation reduces enzymatic activity has been the subject of several studies, the precise mechanism by which this occurs has been elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that in the context of the full-length DNMT3A protein, the R882H mutation stabilizes the formation of large oligomeric DNMT3A species to reduce the overall DNA methyltransferase activity of the mutant protein as well as the WT–R882H complex in a dominant-negative manner. This shift in the DNMT3A oligomeric equilibrium and the resulting reduced enzymatic activity can be partially rescued in the presence of oligomer-disrupting DNMT3L, as well as DNMT3A point mutations along the oligomer-forming interface of the catalytic domain. In addition to modulating the oligomeric state of DNMT3A, the R882H mutation also leads to a DNA-binding defect, which may further reduce enzymatic activity.

This is facilitated by the methyltransferase domain, which contains two distinct surfaces each capable of binding to another catalytic domain monomer (34Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A.

The FF interface is conserved between DNMT3A and DNMT3L, whereas the RD interface is not. DNMT3L can therefore bind to DNMT3A at the FF interface only.

In this work, we analyzed the solution behavior and biochemical properties of the full-length DNMT3A WT and mutant proteins. We find that the R882H hot spot mutation stabilizes the formation of large oligomeric DNMT3A species, which are intrinsically less active than smaller tetramers. When mixed with WT DNMT3A protein, the mutant protein shifts the equilibrium of WT–R882H complexes to larger and less active oligomers, contributing to the dominant-negative behavior of the mutant. DNMT3L disrupts the formation of large oligomers to activate DNMT3A and partially rescues the activity of the R882H mutant. In addition to influencing the multimeric state of DNMT3A, R882H also causes a defect in DNA binding, which is not rescued in the presence of DNMT3L. Together, these observations provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed dominant-negative loss of DNMT3A function in leukemia patients carrying the R882H mutation. The goal of our work was to interrogate the mechanism by which the R882H mutation impairs DNMT3A function. Prior to working with the mutant protein, we investigated whether the N-terminally truncated WT catalytic domain would be a suitable replacement for the WT full-length protein, which has lower ex"
https://openalex.org/W2977828214,"High HIV incidence rates have been observed among pregnant and breastfeeding women in sub-Saharan Africa. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can effectively reduce HIV acquisition in women during these periods; however, understanding of its acceptability and feasibility in antenatal and postpartum populations remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth interviews with 90 study participants in Malawi and Zambia: 39 HIV-negative pregnant/breastfeeding women, 14 male partners, 19 healthcare workers, and 18 policymakers. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to identify themes related to PrEP. As a public health intervention, PrEP was not well-known among patients and healthcare workers; however, when it was described to participants, most expressed positive views. Concerns about safety and adherence were raised, highlighting two critical areas for community outreach. The feasibility of introducing PrEP into antenatal services was also a concern, especially if introduced within already strained health systems. Support for PrEP varied among policymakers in Malawi and Zambia, reflecting the ongoing policy discussions in their respective countries. Implementing PrEP during the pregnancy and breastfeeding periods will require addressing barriers at the individual, facility, and policy levels. Multi- level approaches should be considered in the design of new PrEP programs for antenatal and postpartum populations."

Its structure and bioactivity were studied using gas chromatography (GC), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), periodate oxidation-smith degradation, partial acid hydrolysis, methylation-GC-MS, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), radicals scavenging assays and anti-inflammatory assays. STSP-I was consisted of fucose and galactose with a molar ratio of 1.2:1, and its mass was 373 kDa. The main structural components of STSP-I were →4)-α-D-Galp-(1→ and →3)-β-L-Fucp-(1→, STSP-I was a non-branched polysaccharide, and TEM further revealed the existence of entangled chains and linear forms. Compared with Vitamin C (Vc), STSP-I showed a higher scavenging effect of superoxide radical (EC50 = 0.22 mg/mL) and an equivalent scavenging effect of hydroxyl radical (EC50 = 0.88 mg/mL). STSP-I also exhibited good inhibitory effects of TNF-α, IL-6 and COX-2 mRNA expressions in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells, and the inhibitory effects were more than 91% at the concentrations of 75 and 150 μg/ml. The results indicate that the polysaccharide STSP-I from S. thunbergii with the linear structure may serve as potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents."
https://openalex.org/W2978261775,"The shelter environment may have a severe impact on the dogs' quality of life, and there is thus a need to develop valid tools to assess their welfare. These tools should be sensitive not only to the animals' physical health but also to their mental health, including the assessment of positive and negative emotions. Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA) is a 'whole animal' measure that captures the expressive quality of an animal's demeanour, using descriptive terms such as 'relaxed', 'anxious', and 'playful'. In this study, for the first time, we developed and tested a fixed-list of qualitative QBA terms for application to kennelled dogs. A list of 20 QBA terms was developed based on literature search and an expert opinion survey. Inter-observer reliability was investigated by asking 11 observers to use these terms to score 13 video clips of kennelled dogs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to extract four main dimensions explaining 70.9% of the total variation between clips. PC1 characterised curious/playful/excitable/sociable demeanour, PC2 ranged from comfortable/relaxed to anxious/nervous/stressed expression, PC3 described fearful demeanour, and PC4 characterised bored/depressed demeanour. Observers' agreement on the ranking of video clips on these four expressive dimensions was good (Kendall's W: 0.60-0.80). ANOVA showed a significant effect of observer on mean clip score on all PCs (p<0.05), due to few observers scoring differently from the rest of the group. Results indicate the potential of the proposed list of QBA terms for sheltered dogs to serve, in alignment with other measures, as a non-invasive assessment tool. However, the observer effect on mean PC scores points towards the need for adequate observer training, particularly in live scoring conditions. The QBA scoring tool can be integrated with existing welfare assessment protocols for shelter dogs and strengthen the power of those protocols to evaluate the animals' experience in shelters."
https://openalex.org/W2978617472,"In Lactococcus lactis, cell-wall polysaccharides (CWPSs) act as receptors for many bacteriophages, and their structural diversity among strains explains, at least partially, the narrow host range of these viral predators. Previous studies have reported that lactococcal CWPS consists of two distinct components, a variable chain exposed at the bacterial surface, named polysaccharide pellicle (PSP), and a more conserved rhamnan chain anchored to, and embedded inside, peptidoglycan. These two chains appear to be covalently linked to form a large heteropolysaccharide. The molecular machinery for biosynthesis of both components is encoded by a large gene cluster, named cwps. In this study, using a CRISPR/Cas-based method, we performed a mutational analysis of the cwps genes. MALDI-TOF MS-based structural analysis of the mutant CWPS combined with sequence homology, transmission EM, and phage sensitivity analyses enabled us to infer a role for each protein encoded by the cwps cluster. We propose a comprehensive CWPS biosynthesis scheme in which the rhamnan and PSP chains are independently synthesized from two distinct lipid-sugar precursors and are joined at the extracellular side of the cytoplasmic membrane by a mechanism involving a membrane-embedded glycosyltransferase with a GT-C fold. The proposed scheme encompasses a system that allows extracytoplasmic modification of rhamnan by complex substituting oligo-/polysaccharides.

A high degree of structural diversity is typically observed in these polymers among bacterial species or even among strains of the same species, which is considered to be a consequence of environmental and biological pressures and which results from coevolution of bacteria with their eukaryotic host, their infecting phages, or other microorganisms in a complex microbiota (3Mostowy R.J.

Despite this high diversity, the general mechanisms of PS polymerization and export exhibit conserved features (4Woodward L. Naismith J.H. Bacterial polysaccharide synthesis and export.Curr. Opin.

The most common mechanisms are the Wzx/Wzy- and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter pathways (5Yother J. Capsules of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria: paradigms for polysaccharide biosynthesis and regulation.Annu. Rev. Microb. 2011; 65 (21721938): 563-58110.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.162944Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 6Cuthbertson L. Kos V. Whitfield C.

In both pathways, PS (subunit) synthesis is initiated on a lipid acceptor, most often undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), by addition of sugar-phosphate to form Und-PP-sugar, at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane. In the Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway, following synthesis of individual PS repeat units linked to Und-P, they are exported by the flippase Wzx to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane where they are then assembled into the mature PS by the polymerase Wzy. In the ABC transporter–dependent pathway, the entire PS chain is elongated on the lipid carrier before being translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by an ABC transporter. In Gram-positive bacteria, CWPS or CPS chains can, subsequent to their translocation across the membrane, be covalently anchored onto peptidoglycan by proteins of the LytR–Cps2A–Psr (LCP) family (7Kawai Y. Marles-Wright J. Cleverley R.M. Emmins R. Ishikawa S. Kuwano M. Heinz N. Bui N.K. Hoyland C.N. Ogasawara N. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Daniel R.A. Errington J.

The diversity of PS structures results from the wide variety of glycosyltransferases, which are involved in glycan chain elongation and show a high degree of specificity for both their donor and acceptor substrates. Moreover, structural diversity of glycoconjugates can also be increased by modifications added late in the biosynthesis pathway after translocation of the glycan chain across the cytoplasmic membrane. Three-component systems that carry out extracytoplasmic glycosylation of glycoconjugates have been described previously and are characterized by the involvement of polyprenyl monophosphoryl donors and GT-C fold glycosyltransferases (8Mann E. Whitfield C. A widespread three-component mechanism for the periplasmic modification of bacterial glycoconjugates.Can. J. Chem. 2016; 94: 883-89310.1139/cjc-2015-0594Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The typical three-component modification machinery involves: (i) a glycosyltransferase that transfers a particular sugar from an NDP-sugar donor to polyprenol-P carrier, generating a polyprenol-monophosphate-sugar at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane; (ii) a flippase to transport the polyprenol-P-sugar to the outer side of the membrane; and (iii) a polytopic membrane glycosyltransferase with a GT-C fold that completes the reaction by catalyzing the transfer of the sugar from polyprenol-P-sugar to the glycoconjugate substrate. Lactococcus lactis is a bacterial species of tremendous economic importance, being extensively used in dairy fermentations (9Cavanagh D. Fitzgerald G.F. McAuliffe O. From field to fermentation: the origins of Lactococcus lactis and its domestication to the dairy environment.Food Microbiol. 2015; 47 (25583337): 45-6110.1016/j.fm.2014.11.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As a result, numerous bacteriophages infecting L. lactis have been isolated, constituting a major concern due to their detrimental effect on the quality of the final fermented food products. CWPSs with highly variable structures among L. lactis strains have been identified as receptors for phages of several families (10Mahony J. Cambillau C. van Sinderen D.

Moreover, the observed differences in CWPS structure are, at least partially, responsible for the high degree of specificity of lactococcal phages and their observed narrow host range (11Ainsworth S.

To date, the CWPS chemical structures of five different L. lactis strains have been elucidated (Fig. S1). Based on genomic sequence analysis of the gene cluster encoding CWPS biosynthesis (cwps cluster), L. lactis strains have been classified into three distinct cwps genotypes, i.e. types A, B, and C (12Mahony J.

The first of these, known as the polysaccharide pellicle (PSP), is made up of repeating oligosaccharide units linked by phosphodiester bonds and forms a thin outer layer exposed at the bacterial cell surface (13Chapot-Chartier M.P.

More recently, CWPSs from both an A-type and a B-type strain were found to consist of a unique component made of a rhamnose-rich or rhamnan linear chain, respectively, substituted by short oligosaccharide chains (16Vinogradov E.

Although it is established that the L. lactis NZ9000 cwps cluster is responsible for rhamnan and PSP biosyntheses, functional assignment is not available at present for each of the 22 proteins encoded by the gene cluster. Previously, we have proposed a model for rhamnan biosynthesis in L. lactis NZ9000 involving an ABC transporter–dependent pathway, assigning a function to nine proteins encoded in the 5′ part of the cwps cluster (15Sadovskaya I. Vinogradov E. Courtin P. Armalyte J. Meyrand M. Giaouris E. Palussière S. Furlan S. Péchoux C. Ainsworth S. Mahony J. van Sinderen D. Kulakauskas S. Guérardel Y. Chapot-Chartier M.P.

In contrast, little is known about PSP biosynthesis. In the current study, we have combined a mutational analysis of the cwps genes present in the C-type strain L. lactis NZ9000 with structural analysis of the mutant CWPS and bioinformatics analysis of the proteins encoded in the cwps cluster to propose an original model for PSP biosynthesis and linkage to rhamnan. Moreover, characterization of the constructed mutants by transmission EM and phage sensitivity assays support the proposed model. The conserved, 5′-positioned region of the cwps cluster was proposed to encode the biosynthetic abilities for the production of the rhamnan component of the CWPS, whereas the more variable 3′-located region was proposed to encode for the biosynthesis of the PSP component (11Ainsworth S.

Furthermore, the two chains are believed to be produced independently of each other because PSP-negative variants retain the rhamnan layer in their cell envelope (15Sadovskaya I. Vinogradov E. Courtin P. Armalyte J. Meyrand M. Giaouris E. Palussière S. Furlan S. Péchoux C. Ainsworth S. Mahony J. van Sinderen D. Kulakauskas S. Guérardel Y. Chapot-Chartier M.P.

To identify potential promoter-containing regions within the cwps cluster in L. lactis NZ9000, eight intergenic regions present within this cluster (Fig. S2) were individually cloned upstream of the promoterless lacZ gene located on the pPTPL vector. When β-gal activity was detected, the presence of a promoter sequence in the cloned region was further validated by means of primer-extension analysis (Fig. S2). In this way, three transcription start sites (TSSs) were identified: 28 nucleotides upstream of the annotated translation start site of rmlA (for NZProm1), 60 nucleotides upstream of the annotated translational start site of wpsA (for NZProm2), and 94 nucleotides upstream of the annotated translation start site of wpsH (for NZProm3) (Fig. 1A). Based on the TSSs for rmlA, wpsA, and wpsH, corresponding −10 and −35 hexamers were identified by visual scrutiny (Fig. 2A). The identified −10 regions of the L. lactis NZ9000 cwps gene cluster closely resemble the conserved motif sequence of the −10 regions (TATAAT) in the MG1363 transcriptome, whereas the −35 hexamers do not show significant homology to the conserved motif (TTGACA) (21van der Meulen S.B. de Jong A. Kok J. Transcriptome landscape of Lactococcus lactis reveals many novel RNAs including a small regulatory RNA involved in carbon uptake and metabolism.RNA Biol. 2016; 13 (26950529): 353-36610.1080/15476286.2016.1146855Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The relative strength of each of the promoter-containing regions identified above was measured as specific β-gal activity and assessed at three different time points during growth (Fig. 2B). From the obtained results, it is clear that NZProm1 consistently provided the highest level of expression followed by NZProm2, whereas NZProm3 exhibited barely measurable β-gal activity. Notably, these results are consistent with previous work on the L. lactis MG1363 whole-genome transcriptome that identified two of these regions (NZProm1 and NZProm2) as containing potential TSSs within the gene cluster (21van der Meulen S.B. de Jong A. Kok J. Transcriptome landscape of Lactococcus lactis reveals many novel RNAs including a small regulatory RNA involved in carbon uptake and metabolism.RNA Biol. 2016; 13 (26950529): 353-36610.1080/15476286.2016.1146855Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Additionally, the activity of these promoters appears to be growth phase–independent as it remains constant for all time points tested (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that CWPS biosynthesis is not regulated at the transcriptional level during growth under laboratory conditions. Further assessment of mRNA by means of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR indicated the occurrence of transcriptional read-through within the cwps gene cluster (Fig. S3).Figure 2A, summary of the identified promoter-containing regions along with the transcription start sites for each gene.

The transcriptional organization thus aligns with the previously hypothesized functional organization of the gene cluster. Regarding rhamnan biosynthesis, we have previously proposed a model based on an ABC transporter–dependent pathway, entailing intracellular polymerization of rhamnan before export at the outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane (15Sadovskaya I. Vinogradov E. Courtin P. Armalyte J. Meyrand M. Giaouris E. Palussière S. Furlan S. Péchoux C. Ainsworth S. Mahony J. van Sinderen D. Kulakauskas S. Guérardel Y. Chapot-Chartier M.P.

This model involves nine genes located in the more constant part of the cwps cluster, with the four genes predicted to be involved in dTDP-Rha precursor (rmlA, rmlB, rmlC, and rmlD), the three genes encoding putative rhamnosyltransferases (rgpA, rgpB, and rgpF), and the two genes encoding an ABC transporter (rgpC and rgpD) (Fig. 1A). In addition, we have shown that a tagO homolog (llnz_010205), encoding a putative phosphoglycosyltransferase (PGT) that belongs to the WecA family and located outside of the cwps gene cluster in L. lactis NZ9000, plays a role in rhamnan synthesis presumably as the initial transferase. Also, we obtained proof that LcpA is most likely the major LCP protein involved in rhamnan attachment to peptidoglycan. In our previous studies (11Ainsworth S. Sadovskaya I. Vinogradov E. Courtin P.

This region, which is under the control of NZProm2, contains five genes encoding putative glycosyltransferases, one encoding a putative UDP-galactopyranose mutase, and four encoding membrane proteins (Fig. 1A). Of note, three other genes, rmlX, rgpE, and wpsJ, located in the more conserved part, do not yet have assigned functions. Because PSP is a heteropolysaccharide composed of repeating phospho-hexasaccharide subunits (Fig. 1B) (13Chapot-Chartier M.P. Vinogradov E. Sadovskaya I. Andre G. Mistou M.Y. Trieu-Cuot P. Furlan S.

The expected steps of the PSP biosynthesis would thus be as follows: (i) initiation of PSP subunit synthesis onto a lipid carrier, presumably Und-P, at the inner face of the c"

Many new catalytic and spectroscopic properties of c-type cytochromes have been unraveled by studies on the biochemical pathways underlying the anammox process. The unique anammox intermediate hydrazine is produced by a multiheme cytochrome c protein, hydrazine synthase, through the comproportionation of ammonium and NO and the input of three electrons. It is unclear how these electrons are delivered to hydrazine synthase. Here, we report the discovery of a functional tetraheme c-type cytochrome from the anammox bacterium Kuenenia stuttgartiensis with a naturally-occurring contracted Cys–Lys–Cys–His (CKCH) heme-binding motif, which is encoded in the hydrazine synthase gene cluster. The purified tetraheme protein (named KsTH) exchanged electrons with hydrazine synthase. Complementary spectroscopic techniques revealed that this protein harbors four low-spin hexa-coordinated hemes with His/Lys (heme 1), His/Cys (heme 2), and two His/His ligations (hemes 3 and 4).

Cytochrome c proteins are characterized by one or more c-type heme cofactors that are covalently bound to the protein backbone. The two vinyl groups of a heme b moiety form thioether bonds with the sulfhydryls of two cysteine residues that are commonly arranged in the highly-conserved amino acid sequence CXXCH, the canonical heme-binding motif (20Kranz R.G.

Although the functional implications of covalent heme attachment are not fully understood, it has been proposed that it enhances protein stability and allows for more solvent-exposed heme centers (21Kleingardner J.G. Bren K.L. Biological significance and applications of heme c proteins and peptides.Acc. Chem.

The histidine residue of the CXXCH motif typically serves as the proximal ligand to the heme iron, whereas the distal ligand is often a histidine or a methionine residue at a variable distance from the motif in the amino acid sequence (22Liu J.

Even though the canonical CXXCH is by far the most common heme-binding motif, several cytochromes with more than two residues separating the cysteines have been described. The most extended heme-binding motif that has been identified so far is found in octaheme MccA from Shewanella and several ɛ-Proteobacteria and contains 15 or 17 residues between the two cysteines (CX15/17CH) (23Hartshorne R.S.

Several Desulfovibrio species express c3 tetraheme cytochromes where one or two hemes are bound to a CX4CH motif, and a CX3CH motif has been observed in Desulfovibrio gigas (24Aragão D. Frazão C.

A functional hemecontaining holoprotein protein with a contracted heme-binding motif was produced synthetically only once, and in contrast to extensions, contractions of heme-binding motifs (i.e. CXCH or CCH) have not been observed in nature (25Kleingardner J.G. Bren K.L. Comparing substrate specificity between cytochrome c maturation and cytochrome c heme lyase systems for cytochrome c biogenesis.Metallomics. 2011; 3 (21380436): 396-40310.1039/c0mt00086hCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition to three canonical CXXCH heme-binding motifs, KsTH also contains a CKCH sequence that is fully conserved in all 14 anammox TH sequences that were investigated in this study and potentially serves as a fourth contracted heme-binding site. In this study, we addressed this hypothesis using an array of complementary methods and characterized the spectroscopic and redox properties of purified KsTH. We demonstrated that this contracted heme-binding motif bound a heme c cofactor; we assessed whether this contracted heme coordination resulted in any distinct properties for the heme, and we probed the interaction between purified KsTH and hydrazine synthase. The gene product of kuste2854 was purified directly from K. stuttgartiensis biomass by a three-step purification protocol. The purified protein migrated as a monomeric species on both native and SDS-denaturing PAGE. Peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF MS verified the identity of the protein as kuste2854. Tandem MS analysis of the intact, albeit denatured full-length protein, established a molecular mass of 26095.2744 Da for the monoisotopic species (Fig. 1A). The theoretical value of the apoprotein without the N-terminal targeting sequence (aa 1–29) was 23634.79 Da. The +2460.4844-Da offset in mass could only be explained by the covalent binding of four heme groups to the protein backbone, resulting in a total theoretical mass of 26095.46 Da for the holoprotein, which was an exact match to the mass measured for the denatured full-length protein. Collision-induced dissociation tandem MS (CID MS/MS) detected only one dominant fragment ion of 617.18 [M + H]+ Da, and its spectrum matched the simulated isotope envelope of Fe-protoporphyrin IX (heme b) (Fig. 1B). Consequently, the observed mass discrepancy was most likely due to the covalent attachment of four heme groups instead of the three that were predicted from the presence of three canonical CXXCH heme c–binding motifs in the KsTH sequence. Hence, this additional heme must be bound to a noncanonical heme-binding motif. Apart from the cysteine residues present in the three canonical heme-binding sites, there are four additional cysteines present in the KsTH sequence (Cys-12, Cys-14, Cys-20, and Cys-151). Only two of these cysteine residues could constitute a heme-binding site, the contracted CKCH motif, which has been designated as “heme 1–binding site” (Fig. 2).Figure 2Sequence alignment of anammox TH sequences and cytochrome c554.

Bis-pyridine heme adducts that are linked to the protein via two thioether bonds result in an absorbance maximum of the α-band at 550 nm, whereas the presence of only a single thioether bond results in a red-shifted maximum at 553 nm (26Ishida M. Dohmae N. Shiro Y. Oku T. Iizuka T. Isogai Y. Design and synthesis of de novo cytochromes c.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15274636): 9823-983310.1021/bi049546eCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In perfect agreement, the reduced alkaline bis-pyridine adduct of KsTH displayed the typical absorbance maximum at 550 nm (Fig. 3), which was indicative of two thioether bonds linking the hemes to the protein backbone (26Ishida M. Dohmae N. Shiro Y. Oku T. Iizuka T. Isogai Y. Design and synthesis of de novo cytochromes c.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15274636): 9823-983310.1021/bi049546eCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results further corroborated that the CKCH motif served as the additional heme-binding site in KsTH. UV-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy were used to investigate the spin state of the KsTH hemes as well as the nature of their ligation. In optical spectroscopy, oxidized high-spin hemes with a single axial ligand exhibit a Soret maximum around 390 nm and a charge transfer absorption band around 600 nm, whereas in the reduced state a broad signal around 430 nm is generally observed (13Arciero D.M.

Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c. Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Google Scholar). Neither of these two features were observed in the KsTH spectra (Fig. 4). In EPR spectroscopy high-spin hemes give rise to a strong signal centered at g = 6 (27Moore G. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c.

Interactions between a high-spin heme and a neighboring co-factor can result in spectral features different from the g = 6 signal. In the case of a multiheme protein such as KsTH, these interaction signals are situated between the signals of the individual hemes. For example, such a signal is observed for c554 at g = 3.9. Nothing similar could be observed for KsTH. Furthermore, the EPR spectrum of KsTH was very similar to the spectrum of c554 at pH 12, where all hemes of c554 have been shown to be low-spin (30Andersson K.K. Lipscomb J.D. Valentine M. Münck E.

Methods A total of 535 non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients undergoing either ETV (n = 358) or TDF (n = 177) treatment were enrolled. Patients were followed for at least 12 months after stopping ETV or TDF treatment. Most patients (86.3%) fulfilled the retreatment criteria of Taiwan's National Health Plan. Results The 5-year cumulative rates of clinical relapse and retreatment were 52.1% and 47%, respectively, in 160 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients, and were 62% and 54.8%, respectively, in 375 HBeAg-negative patients. The median duration from the end of treatment until clinical relapse and retreatment was 40 and 57 weeks, respectively, for all patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that discontinuing TDF treatment, old age, male gender, and higher baseline HBsAg levels were independent factors of retreatment in HBeAg-positive patients; old age, HBV genotype B, and higher baseline and end-of-treatment HBsAg levels were independent factors in HBeAg-negative patients. A total of 18.8% of retreated patients satisfied the retreatment criteria of hepatic decompensation according to Taiwan's National Health Plan. Of the 64 patients who had clinical relapse without retreatment, 17 achieved sustained virological remission and 26 did not experience clinical relapse until their last visit after clinical relapse. Four patients developed HBsAg loss. Conclusions The 5-year retreatment rate was about 50% in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. Discontinuing TDF treatment was an independent factor of retreatment in HBeAg-positive patients."

https://openalex.org/W2978892956,"Citrus bacterial canker (CBC) caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) is a systemic bacterial disease that affects citrus plantations globally. Biotic stress in plants has been linked to a group of important transcription factors known as Basic Leucine Zippers (BZIPs). In this study, CsBZIP40 was functionally characterized by expression analysis, including induction by Xcc and hormones, subcellular localization, over-expression and RNAi silencing. CsBZIP40 belongs to group D of the CsBZIP family of transcription factors and localizes in the nucleus, potentially serving as a transcriptional regulator. In wild type (WT) plants CsBZIP40 can be induced by plant hormones in addition to infection by Xcc which has given insight into its involvement in CBC. In the present study, over-expression of CsBZIP40 conferred resistance to Xcc while its silencing led to Xcc susceptibility. Both over-expression and RNAi affected salicylic acid (SA) production and expression of the genes involved in the SA synthesis and signaling pathway, in addition to interaction of CsBZIP40 with CsNPR1, as detected by a GST pull-down assay. Taken together, the results of this study confirmed the important role of CsBZIP40 in improving resistance to citrus canker through the SA signaling pathway by the presence of NPR1 to activate PR genes. Our findings are of potential value in the breeding of tolerance to CBC in citrus fruits."

Our objective was to determine the concentration of ceftiofur and its metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract of steers treated with ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (CCFA) or ceftiofur hydrochloride (CHCL), determine the effect of these drugs on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fecal Escherichia coli, and evaluate shifts in the microbiome. Steers were administered either a single dose (6.6 mg/kg) of CCFA or 2.2 mg/kg of CHCL every 24 hours for 3 days. Ceftiofur and its metabolites were measured in the plasma, interstitium, ileum and colon. The concentration and MIC of fecal E. coli and the fecal microbiota composition were assessed after treatment. The maximum concentration of ceftiofur was higher in all sampled locations of steers treated with CHCL. Measurable drug persisted longer in the intestine of CCFA-treated steers. There was a significant decrease in E. coli concentration (P = 0.002) within 24 hours that persisted for 2 weeks after CCFA treatment. In CHCL-treated steers, the mean MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli peaked at 48 hours (mean MIC = 20.45 ug/ml, 95% CI = 10.29–40.63 ug/ml), and in CCFA-treated steers, mean MIC peaked at 96 hours (mean MIC = 10.68 ug/ml, 95% CI = 5.47–20.85 ug/ml). Shifts in the microbiome of steers in both groups were due to reductions in Firmicutes and increases in Bacteroidetes. CCFA leads to prolonged, low intestinal drug concentrations, and is associated with decreased E. coli concentration, an increased MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli at specific time points, and shifts in the fecal microbiota. CHCL led to higher intestinal drug concentrations over a shorter duration. Effects on E. coli concentration and the microbiome were smaller in this group, but the increase in the MIC of ceftiofur in fecal E. coli was similar."

Ligand binding can be essential for a protein to function in the cell by stabilizing or altering the conformation of a protein, particularly for partially or completely unstructured proteins. However, the mechanisms by which ligand binding impacts disordered proteins or influences the role of disorder in protein folding is not clear. To gain insight into this question, the mechanism of folding induced by the binding of a Pro-rich peptide ligand to the SH3 domain of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase unfolded in the presence of urea has been studied using kinetic methods. Under strongly denaturing conditions, folding was found to follow a conformational selection (CS) mechanism. However, under mildly denaturing conditions, a ligand concentration–dependent switch in the mechanism was observed. The folding mechanism switched from being predominantly a CS mechanism at low ligand concentrations to being predominantly an induced fit (IF) mechanism at high ligand concentrations. The switch in the mechanism manifests itself as an increase in the reaction flux along the IF pathway at high ligand concentrations.

Although these models were proposed to explain the allostery seen in the case of many multimeric proteins, the same concepts of induced fit (IF) 2The abbreviations used are: IFinduced fitPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseSH3Src homology 3CSconformational selectionIDPintrinsically disordered proteinLligandDLSdynamic light scatteringTStransition stateNnativeUunfolded. and conformational selection (CS) can be used to describe structural changes induced upon ligand binding to monomeric proteins. induced fit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Src homology 3 conformational selection intrinsically disordered protein ligand dynamic light scattering transition state native unfolded. Importantly, proteins are stabilized when a ligand binds more strongly to the folded state than to the unfolded state. Hence, a protein that would be unfolded in the absence of a ligand in the presence of denaturant is expected to fold completely upon the addition of ligand. Consequently, it becomes possible to study the folding reaction at high denaturant concentration (5Ivarsson Y. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. Malatesta F. Brunori M. Gianni S. An on-pathway intermediate in the folding of a PDZ domain.J. Biol.

This capability enables an important question in protein folding to be addressed: is the mechanism of folding at high denaturant concentration the same as that at low denaturant concentration? To address this question, it is first necessary to determine the mechanism of binding-induced folding. Because there are two steps, ligand binding and folding, associated with the acquisition of structure, there are two possible mechanisms for attaining the folded state (Fig. 1). The IF mechanism involves weak binding of the ligand to the unfolded state followed by folding. It posits that the binding energy, although not large, is sufficient to drive folding to the structured state. In contrast, the CS mechanism posits that the ligand binds selectively to a pre-existing, binding-competent conformation of the protein, which is in equilibrium with the unbound, structureless state. Thermodynamic coupling eventually leads to the folding of all the protein molecules. An understanding of binding-induced folding in the case of denaturant-unfolded proteins will provide insight into the mechanism by which an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) gains structure upon binding to its ligand. For IDPs, it has been predicted that both the IF and CS pathways may be operative at the same time (7Hammes G.G. Chang Y.-C. Oas T.G.

These biological processes are mediated by the formation of multimeric protein complexes. The formation of these complexes is facilitated by the binding of the SH3 domain to a Pro-rich motif present in its binding partner. SH3 domains recognize and bind to peptides having a PXXP (X is any amino acid residue) sequence segment (27Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T.

No significant conformational change occurs in the SH3 domain upon such binding (30Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L.

Chem. 2010; 391 (19919182): 33-4210.1515/BC.2010.003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the mechanism of ligand-induced folding of the SH3 domain of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was characterized. The ligand used was a Pro-rich peptide having nine amino acid residues (RPLPPRPSK). This peptide had been shown to bind to the PI3K SH3 domain in earlier studies (30Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Structural basis for the binding of proline-rich peptides to SH3 domains.Cell. 1994; 76 (7510218): 933-94510.1016/0092-8674(94)90367-0Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Here, binding to the peptide ligand is shown to stabilize the native protein against urea-induced denaturation. Addition of the peptide ligand to the protein in unfolding conditions is shown to drive the folding of the unfolded protein. To understand the mechanism of ligand-induced folding, the kinetics of the folding process was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy. A ligand concentration–mediated switch in the mechanism was found to occur, from being dominated by CS at low ligand concentrations to being IF at high ligand concentrations, under mildly denaturing conditions. The current study showing that binding-induced folding under unfolding conditions can be tuned from following only a CS pathway to following both the CS and IF pathways suggests that IDP folding is also tuneable by varying ligand concentration. In this study, the mechanism of folding of the PI3K SH3 domain, induced by a peptide ligand, has been studied. The PI3K SH3 domain is a well-folded, globular protein that does not undergo any major structural change upon binding to peptide ligands (30Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Structural basis for the binding of proline-rich peptides to SH3 domains.Cell. 1994; 76 (7510218): 933-94510.1016/0092-8674(94)90367-0Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 31Batra-Safferling R.

Chem. 2010; 391 (19919182): 33-4210.1515/BC.2010.003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Folding induced by the binding of the peptide ligand was studied under unfolding conditions where the free protein is mostly unfolded, but the protein–ligand complex is folded (Fig. 2c). Equilibrium binding studies were carried out at different urea concentrations by incubating a fixed concentration of protein with various concentrations of a Pro-rich peptide ligand for 5 h. The concentration of protein used in each case was at least 20-fold less than the KD value at every urea concentration so that binding did not affect the free ligand concentration. The sole Trp residue in the protein, Trp-53, is at the binding interface, and an ∼20-nm blue shift in the wavelength of the maximum fluorescence emission, accompanied by an increase in the fluorescence quantum yield, was seen upon ligand binding (Fig. 2a) upon excitation at 268 nm. Fig. 2a also shows that, in the absence of any peptide ligand, the Tyr fluorescence of the protein, which is maximum at 300 nm (32Eftink M.R. Fluorescence techniques for studying protein structure.Methods Biochem. Anal. 1991; 35 (2002770): 127-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dasgupta A. Udgaonkar J.B. Transient non-native burial of a Trp residue occurs initially during the unfolding of a SH3 domain.Biochemistry. 2012; 51 (22998628): 8226-823410.1021/bi3008627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), increases upon unfolding as the quenching of Tyr fluorescence by FRET occurring from Tyr residues to Trp-53 in N (native) is released upon unfolding to U (unfolded). The equilibrium binding curve obtained at each of four different urea concentrations (Fig. 3, a–d) yielded the overall apparent dissociation constant, which was found to increase in value with an increase in urea concentration (Fig. 3, a–d). Nevertheless, binding was observed at high ligand concentration. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the ligand-bound state at any of the urea concentrations showed maximum fluorescence emission at 335 nm (Fig. 3, inset) as did the bound state under native conditions (Fig. 2a). Because folding is induced by ligand binding (Fig. 1), at equilibrium, both the ligand-bound N state and the ligand-bound U state will contribute to the fraction of protein with bound ligand. The data were fit to Equation 2 and led to the determination of KDU. The fraction of protein in the UL state was found to be negligible compared with the fraction of protein in the NL state. The logarithm of KDU was found to increase linearly with an increase in urea concentration (Fig. S1b). The kinetics of ligand-induced folding was monitored at various concentrations of ligand, at different urea concentrations, in manual mixing experiments. The kinetic trace at each concentration of urea was describable by a single-exponential equation (Fig. 4, a–d). At all the urea concentrations, the t = ∞ points of the kinetic folding traces fell on the equilibrium binding curve, indicating that the reactions had been monitored till completion (Fig. 5, a–d). Nevertheless, a burst phase was observed to have occurred within the dead time of manual mixing (Fig. 4, a–d) whose amplitude increased with a decrease in the concentration of urea (Fig. 5, a–d). Stopped-flow mixing (dead time, 11 ms) did not abolish the burst phase (Fig. S4).Figure 5Comparison of the kinetic amplitudes with the equilibrium amplitudes of folding in 6 (a), 5 (b), 3.5 (c), and 2.8 m urea (d).

The percentage of molecules present in the U state, as determined from the equilibrium unfolding curve measured in the absence of ligand (Fig. 2c), is 98, 88, 30, and 15% in 6, 5. 3.5 and 2.8 m urea, respectively. Hence, it was likely that the burst phase corresponded to the very rapid binding of the ligand to the pre-existing N state population at that urea concentration and that this binding occurred on a much faster time scale than the folding reaction. Indeed, when protein and ligand were mixed under native conditions in the absence of any urea, under which essentially no U state is present, the entire change in fluorescence was observed to occur in a burst phase (Fig. S3). To confirm that the burst phase change did indeed correspond to the binding of ligand to pre-existing N, it was shown that the relative burst phase amplitude observed at a particular urea concentration corresponded to the fraction of molecules present as N at that urea concentration (Fig. 6a). Thus, the burst phase change corresponds to the binding of ligand to pre-existing N, which is not accompanied by any structural change, whereas the observable phase of fluorescence change at each of the four urea concentrations corresponds to the ligand binding–induced folding of pre-existing U. Hence, the dependence of the burst phase amplitude on the ligand concentration represented the binding curve for the N state at each urea concentration. The signal for unbound N was taken from the equilibrium binding curve because the N and U signals at the wavelength used for acquiring the binding curves were not very different (Fig. 2a). The value of KD for N (KDN) at each urea concentration was thus obtained; not surprisingly, the presence of urea caused the binding affinity of the ligand for N to decrease (Figs. 5 and S1a and Table 1).Table 1Parameters governing the ligand-induced folding of the PI3K SH3 domain6 m urea5 m urea3.5 m urea2.8 m ureakf (s−1)(5 ± 0.2) × 10−4(1.5 ± 0.4) × 10−3(5.2 ± 0.08) × 10−3(1.2 ± 0.07) × 10−2ku (s−1)(1.4 ± 0.2) × 10−2(7.3 ± 0.4) × 10−3(4.7 ± 0.4) × 10−3(3 ± 0.5) × 10−3kfL (s−1)(1 ± 0.06) × 10−2(2 ± 0.2) × 10−2kuL (s−1)(2 ± 0.4) × 10−4(1 ± 0.6) × 10−4KDN (μm)121 ± 11118 ± 1234 ± 218 ± 8KDU (μm)10,900 ± 15508,000 ± 11001,800 ± 320774 ± 25 Open table in a new tab It is assumed that the ligand binding steps are much faster than the conformational conversion steps. When the concentration of the ligand is much higher than the protein concentration, the observed rate constants of the two extreme mechanisms, CS and IF, are expected to decrease and increase, respectively, with an increase in ligand concentration (7Hammes G.G. Chang Y.-C. Oas T.G. Conformational selection or induced fit: a flux description of reaction mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106 (19666553): 13737-1374110.1073/pnas.0907195106Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the dependences on ligand concentration of observed rate constants of folding induced by ligand. Fig. 7, a and b, show the observed rate constants at 6 and 5 m urea where the fraction of protein in the N state is 2 and 12%, respectively. The observed rate constants decreased asymptotically in a hyperbolic manner with an increase in the concentration of ligand. When fit to the CS model (Equation 3), the data yielded the folding and unfolding rate constants at each urea concentration (Table 1), which were in agreement with the folding and unfolding rate constants obtained from folding and unfolding experiments with the free protein in the absence of ligand (Figs. 6b and S2, a–d). Fig. 7, c and d, show the dependences of the observed rate constants on ligand concentration at 3.5 and 2.8 m urea, respectively. In these cases, the rate constants decreased at low ligand concentrations and thereafter increased at high ligand concentrations. The data were explainable by a model that took into account both the mechanisms being operative simultaneously. The rate constants of folding and unfolding of the free PI3K SH3 domain and of the protein–ligand complex were obtained by fitting the data in Fig. 7, c and d, to Equation 4 (Table 1). The folding and unfolding rate constants of the free protein were in good agreement with the rate constants obtained from urea-induced folding and unfolding experiments carried out in the absence of any ligand (Figs. 6b and S2, a–d). The flux along each pathway at 3.5 and 2.8 m urea was then calculated from the knowledge of the rate constants and the population of each species on each pathway (Equations 7 and 10). The fractional flux along the IF pathway was found to increase at high ligand concentrations as the fractional flux along the CS pathway decreased (Fig. 8, a and b). It was also noted that, at 2.8 m urea, the fractional flux along the IF pathway became greater than that along the CS pathway at a lower concentration of peptide ligand than at 3.5 m urea (Fig. 8, a and b). It was important to rule out any nonspecific binding of ligand to protein at very high ligand concentrations. This was done by monitoring binding by measurement of fluorescence anisotropy, whose value depends on the size of the protein–ligand complex formed. The binding curve obtained with fluorescence anisotropy as the probe was found to be coincident with that obtained using fluorescence intensity as the probe, even at high ligand concentrations (Fig. S6). This ruled out the possibility of any nonspecific binding occurring at high ligand concentrations. Moreover, previous NMR experiments carried out under native conditions had shown that chemical shift perturbation occurs only at the primary binding site (34Booker G.W. Gout I. Downing K.A. Driscoll P.C. Boyd J. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. Solution structure and ligand-binding site of the SH3 domain of the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Cell. 1993; 73 (7684655): 813-82210.1016/0092-8674(93)90259-SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), even at a 2 mm concentration of the same peptide ligand used in the current study. Direct measurement of folding rate constants under denaturing conditions and unfolding rate constants under renaturing conditions was possible because of the coupling of the folding reaction to the binding reaction. The folding and unfolding rate constants at 5 and 6 m urea were determined by fitting the dependences of the observed rate constant on ligand concentration to Equation 3. The folding rate constants were found to fall on the extrapolated folding arm of the chevron (Fig. 6b). Moreover, the unfolding rate constants at these urea concentrations also matched the unfolding rate constants measured by urea-induced unfolding experiments (Fig. 6b). At 3.5 and 2.8 m urea, the folding and unfolding rate constants were determined by fitting the dependence of the observed rate constant on ligand concentration to Equation 4. The unfolding rate constants under renaturing conditions were found to fall on the extrapolated unfolding arm of the chevron (Fig. 6b). Additionally, the fraction of unfolded protein at every urea concentration, as calculated from the folding and unfolding rate constants, was found to be in agreement with the fraction of unfolded protein obtained from an equilibrium unfolding experiment (Fig. 6a). The mechanism of structure formation upon ligand binding has remained an open question for many years now. There has been a large body of work done on many systems to elucidate the mechanism of folding induced by binding (10Sugase K. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E.

Materials and methods Nested prospective cohort study within a randomized clinical trial of adult patients initiating ART at clinics in urban Nairobi and rural Maseno, Kenya, between 2013–2014. We estimated mortality incidence rates following ART initiation and used Cox proportional hazards regression to identify predictors of mortality within 12 months of ART initiation. Analyses were stratified by clinic site to examine differences in mortality correlates and risk by location. Results Among 811 participants initiated on ART, the mortality incidence rate within a year of initiating ART was 7.44 per 100 person-years (95% CI 5.71, 9.69). Among 207 Maseno and 612 Nairobi participants initiated on ART, the mortality incidence rates (per 100 person-years) were 12.78 (95% CI 8.49, 19.23) and 5.72 (95% CI 4.05, 8.09). Maseno had a 2.20-fold greater risk of mortality than Nairobi (95% CI 1.29, 3.76; P = 0.004). This association remained [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.09 (95% CI 1.17, 3.74); P = 0.013] when adjusting for age, gender, education, pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR), and CD4 count, but not when adjusting for BMI. In unadjusted analyses, other predictors (P<0.05) of mortality included male gender (HR = 1.74), age (HR = 1.04 for 1-year increase), fewer years of education (HR = 0.92 for 1-year increase), unemployment (HR = 1.89), low body mass index (BMI<18.5 m/kg2; HR = 4.99), CD4 count <100 (HR = 11.67) and 100–199 (HR = 3.40) vs. 200–350 cells/μL, and pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR; HR = 2.49). The increased mortality risk associated with older age, males, and greater education remained when adjusted for location, age, education and PDR, but not when adjusted for BMI and CD4 count. PDR remained associated with increased mortality risk when adjusted for location, age, gender, education, and BMI, but not when adjusted for CD4 count. CD4 and BMI associations with increased mortality risk persisted in multivariable analyses. Despite similar baseline CD4 counts across locations, mortality risk associated with low CD4 count, low BMI, and PDR was greater in Maseno than Nairobi in stratified analyses. Conclusions High short-term post-ART mortality was observed, partially due to low CD4 count and BMI at presentation, especially in the rural setting. Male gender, older age, and markers of lower socioeconomic status were also associated with greater mortality risk. Engaging patients earlier in HIV infection remains critical. PDR may influence short-term mortality and further studies to optimize management will be important in settings with increasing PDR."

Previous work has demonstrated that cryptochrome 2 (Cry2)/cryptochrome-interacting β helix–loop–helix (CIB), a blue light–activated protein–protein dimerization module from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, together with BCL2-associated X apoptosis regulator (BAX), an outer mitochondrial membrane–targeting pro-apoptotic protein, can be used for light-mediated initiation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and downstream apoptosis. In this work, we further developed the original light-activated Cry2-BAX system (hereafter referred to as OptoBAX) by improving the photophysical properties and light-independent interactions of this optogenetic switch. The resulting optogenetic constructs significantly reduced the frequency of light exposure required for membrane permeabilization activation and also decreased dark-state cytotoxicity. We used OptoBAX in a series of experiments in Neuro-2a and HEK293T cells to measure the timing of the dramatic morphological and biochemical changes occurring in cells after light-induced MOMP. In these experiments, we used OptoBAX in tandem with fluorescent reporters to image key events in early apoptosis, including membrane inversion, caspase cleavage, and actin redistribution. We then used these data to construct a timeline of biochemical and morphological events in early apoptosis, demonstrating a direct link between MOMP-induced redistribution of actin and apoptosis progression. In summary, we created a next-generation Cry2/CIB–BAX system requiring less frequent light stimulation and established a timeline of critical apoptotic events, providing detailed insights into key steps in early apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2978206908,"Semaphorins, specifically type IV, are important regulators of axonal guidance and have been increasingly implicated in poor prognoses in a number of different solid cancers. In conjunction with their cognate PLXNB family receptors, type IV members have been increasingly shown to mediate oncogenic functions necessary for tumor development and malignant spread. In this study, we investigated the role of semaphorin 4C (SEMA4C) in osteosarcoma growth, progression, and metastasis. We investigated the expression and localization of SEMA4C in primary osteosarcoma patient tissues and its tumorigenic functions in these malignancies. We demonstrate that overexpression of SEMA4C promotes properties of cellular transformation, while RNAi knockdown of SEMA4C promotes adhesion and reduces cellular proliferation, colony formation, migration, wound healing, tumor growth, and lung metastasis. These phenotypic changes were accompanied by reductions in activated AKT signaling, G1 cell cycle delay, and decreases in expression of mesenchymal marker genes SNAI1, SNAI2, and TWIST1. Lastly, monoclonal antibody blockade of SEMA4C in vitro mirrored that of the genetic studies. Together, our results indicate a multi-dimensional oncogenic role for SEMA4C in metastatic osteosarcoma and more importantly that SEMA4C has actionable clinical potential."
https://openalex.org/W2977416477,"Sensor network intrusion detection has attracted extensive attention. However, previous intrusion detection methods face the highly imbalanced attack class distribution problem, and they may not achieve a satisfactory performance. To solve this problem, we propose a new intrusion detection algorithm based on normalized cut spectral clustering for sensor network in this paper. The main aim is to reduce the imbalance degree among classes in an intrusion detection system. First, we design a normalized cut spectral clustering to reduce the imbalance degree between every two classes in the intrusion detection data set. Second, we train a network intrusion detection classifier on the new data set. Finally, we do extensive experiments and analyze the experimental results in detail. Simulation experiments show that our algorithm can reduce the imbalance degree among classes and reserves the distribution of the original data on the one hand, and improve effectively the detection performance on the other hand."
https://openalex.org/W2978940136,"Purpose To evaluate the effect of topical mydriatic eye drops on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) parameters in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods 27 eyes of 27 patients suffering from AMD were included in this cross-sectional study. Patients with ≥-4.5 diopters spherical equivalent, corneal opacities or dense cataract preventing high-quality imaging were excluded. Whole-en-face scans of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) in the central 3x3mm foveal region as well as whole-en-face and peripapillary scans of the radial peripapillary capillaries (RPC) were generated using OCTA (AngioVue®, Optovue). Imaging was first conducted with patients’ eyes in miosis, then in mydriasis after instillation of a dilating eye drop (0.5% tropicamide, 2.5% phenylephrine-HCl). Main outcome measures were flow density (FD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ), signal strength index (SSI) and motion artifact score (MAS). Results Our results reveal that in AMD patients there is no significant difference between FD measurements taken in miosis and those taken in mydriasis around the SCP (p = 0.198), DCP (p = 0.458), RPC whole-en-face (p = 0.275) and RPC peripapillary (p = 0.503). Measurements taken in these two states appear to be equivalent for assessment of FD (90%CI within ± 0.05). No significant difference was found either in the area of the FAZ (p = 0.338) or in the SSI (p = 0.371) before and after the instillation of tropicamide/phenylephrine. MAS was significantly lower after the application of mydriatic eye drops (p = 0.003). Conclusions Our findings reveal that neither measurements of FD nor measurements of the FAZ area changed significantly in AMD patients after the application of tropicamide/phenylephrine. Since MAS improved significantly in dilation, mydriatic examination is recommended. Nevertheless, a comparison of OCTA metrics from images taken with different pupil states (miosis versus mydriasis) is valid for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2979071652,"The aims of this study were to assess the characteristics of all acute poisoning admissions among adult emergency department (ED) patients, to identify factors associated with admission and to calculate direct medical cost.Data of 2017 (1st January to 31st December) were collected and analyzed retrospectively using patients' medical records and hospital invoices. Factors associated with type of hospitalization were identified using appropriate statistics.A total of 1,214 hospital admissions were included, accounting for 3.6% of all ED admissions. Men (62.2%) and the age group 21-40 years (43.0%) accounted for the largest proportion. Substances most commonly involved were ethanol (52.9%), benzodiazepines (9.7%), cocaine (4.9%), cannabis (4.6%), antidepressants (4.6%) and psychostimulants (4.6%). A total of 4,561 treatment acts were recorded, most commonly monitoring of vital signs (63.6%) and medication and/or intravenous drip administration (62.9%). Patients were discharged home after having received care in the emergency department (ED-amb) in 54.5% of admissions, were admitted to the emergency-department-24-hours-observation unit (ED-24h) or were hospitalized (Hosp) in 24.6% and 20.9% of admissions, respectively. Factors found to be associated with hospitalization type were age, hour of admission, victim location, degree of severity, use of antidotes, involvement of antidepressants, antipsychotics, psychostimulants, benzodiazepines and ethanol. Total cost was €1,512,346 with an average of €1,287 per admission.Poisonings entail a considerable percentage of patients admitted to an ED and financial burden. In particular, ethanol poisonings account for the largest proportion of all ED admissions. Comparison of our figures with other data is hampered by the heterogeneity in inclusion criteria. Availability of a uniform template would facilitate comparison and allow better monitoring policies for prevention and cost reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2978395405,"We performed a retrospective cohort study that aimed to identify one or more groups that followed a pattern of chronic, high prescription use and quantify individuals’ time-dependent probabilities of belonging to a high-utilizer group. We analyzed data from 52,456 adults age 18–45 who enrolled in Medicaid from 2009–2017 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania who filled at least one prescription for an opioid analgesic. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify groups of individuals with distinct patterns of prescription opioid use over time. We found the population to be comprised of three distinct trajectory groups. The first group comprised 83% of the population and filled few, if any, opioid prescriptions after their index prescription. The second group (12%) initially filled an average of one prescription per month, but declined over two years to near-zero. The third group (6%) demonstrated sustained high opioid prescriptions utilization. Using individual patients’ posterior probability of membership in the high utilization group, which can be updated iteratively over time as new information become available, we defined a sensitive threshold predictive of sustained future opioid utilization. We conclude that individuals at risk of sustained opioid utilization can be identified early in their clinical course from limited observational data."
https://openalex.org/W2979084451,"Mechanical loading is essential for the maintenance of musculoskeletal homeostasis. Cartilage has been demonstrated to be highly mechanoresponsive, but the mechanisms by which chondrocytes respond to mechanical stimuli are not clearly understood. The goal of the study was to determine how LRP4, LRP5, and LRP6 within canonical Wnt-signaling are regulated in simulated microgravity and cyclic hydrostatic pressure, and to investigate the potential role of LRP 4/5/6 in cartilage degeneration. Rat chondrosacroma cell (RCS) pellets were stimulated using either cyclic hydrostatic pressure (1Hz, 7.5 MPa, 4hr/day) or simulated microgravity in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor (11RPM, 24hr/day). LRP4/5/6 mRNA expression was assessed by RT-qPCR and LRP5 protein expression was determined by fluorescent immunostaining. To further evaluate our in vitro findings in vivo, mice were subjected to hindlimb suspension for 14 days and the femoral heads stained for LRP5 expression. We found that, in vitro, LRP4/5/6 mRNA expression is modulated in a time-dependent manner by mechanical stimulation. Additionally, LRP5 protein expression is upregulated in response to both simulated microgravity and cyclic hydrostatic pressure. LRP5 is also upregulated in vivo in the articular cartilage of hindlimb suspended mice. This is the first study to examine how LRP4/5/6, critical receptors within musculoskeletal biology, respond to mechanical stimulation. Further elucidation of this mechanism could provide significant clinical benefit for the identification of pharmaceutical targets for the maintenance of cartilage health."
https://openalex.org/W2977583682,"Military anesthesia meets unique logistical, technical, tactical, and human constraints, but to date limited data have been published on anesthesia management during military operations.This study aimed to describe and analyze French anesthetic activity in a deployed military setting.Between October 2015 and February 2018, all patients managed by Sainte-Anne Military Hospital anesthesiologists deployed in mission were included. Anesthesia management was described and compared with the same surgical procedures in France performed by the same anesthesia team (hernia repair, lower and upper limb surgeries). Demographics, type of surgical procedure, and surgical activity were also described. The primary endpoint was to describe anesthesia management during the deployment of forward surgical teams (FST). The secondary endpoint was to compare anesthesia modalities during FST deployment with those usually used in a military teaching hospital.During the study period, 1547 instances of anesthesia were performed by 11 anesthesiologists during 20 missions, totaling 1237 days of deployment in nine different theaters. The majority consisted of regional anesthesia, alone (43.5%) or associated with general anesthesia (21%). Compared with France, there was a statistically significant increase in the use of regional anesthesia in hernia repair, lower and upper limb surgeries during deployment. The majority of patients were civilians as part of medical support to populations.In the context of an austere environment, the use of regional anesthesia techniques predominated when possible. These results show that the training of military anesthetists must be complete, including anesthesia, intensive care, pediatrics, and regional anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2977321082,"Despite the well-recognised relevance of screening in colorectal cancer (CRC) control, adherence to screening is often suboptimal. Improving adherence represents an important public health strategy. We investigated the influence of family doctors (FDs) as determinant of CRC screening adherence by comparing each FDs practice participation probability to that of the residents in the same geographic areas using the whole population geocoded.We used multilevel logistic regression model to investigate factors associated with CRC screening adherence, among 333,843 people at their first screening invitation. Standardized Adherence Rates (SAR) by age, gender, and socioeconomic status were calculated comparing FDs practices to the residents in the same geographic areas using geocoded target population.Screening adherence increased from 41.0% (95% CI, 40.8-41.2) in 2006-2008 to 44.7% (95% CI, 44.5-44.9) in 2011-2012. Males, the most deprived and foreign-born people showed low adherence. FD practices and the percentage of foreign-born people in a practice were significant clustering factors. SAR for 145 (21.4%) FDs practices differed significantly from people living in the same areas. Predicted probabilities of adherence were 31.7% and 49.0% for FDs with low and high adherence, respectively.FDs showed a direct and independent effect to the CRC screening adherence of the people living in their practice. FDs with significantly high adherence level could be the key to adherence improvement.Most deprived individuals and foreigners represent relevant targets for interventions in public health aimed to improve CRC screening adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2977537390,"In Brazil, alcohol consumption is estimated to range from 7 to 40% in pregnant women. This research investigated the motivation for alcohol consumption or abstinence during pregnancy in a purposive sample of Brazilian women.Clinical-qualitative research was conducted, in which 14 women participated, identified as risk-drinkers during pregnancy by the T-ACE screening tool. Data were collected through semi-structured individual interviews. Reports were recorded, transcribed and investigated by a thematic content analysis approach. The results were discussed based on a comprehensive and interpretive framework.Sixteen themes were extracted and these were then classified into three thematic categories: (a) general motives for alcohol use, (b) specific motives for drinking during pregnancy, and (c) reasons for partly or fully abstaining from drinking during pregnancy. Social motives were the most relevant, particularly due to deeply rooted cultural values. Enhancement motives were widely mentioned and associated with a hedonic posture. Consumption also aimed to deal with negative emotions, characterizing two types of coping specifically to pregnancy: first, perceiving pregnancy as a period of less opportunity for social interaction and, therefore, drinking alcohol at home to compensate; secondly, perceiving pregnancy as a period of greater irritability, and hence experiencing difficulties to abstain. On the other hand, concern about fetal health, disapproval of consumption by relatives and health professionals, as well as the social construction of mothering were reported as reasons to abstain.Some specificities influence the decision to continue or discontinue alcohol consumption during pregnancy. To reduce consumption, we suggest educational actions based on a collective health perspective, articulated with individualized measures that allow identification and proper intervention for women at risk."
https://openalex.org/W2979152337,"Spleen stromal lines which support in vitro hematopoiesis are investigated for their lineage origin and hematopoietic support function in vivo. Marker expression and gene profiling identify a lineage relationship with mesenchymal stem cells and perivascular reticular cells described recently in bone marrow. Stromal lines commonly express Cxcl12, Pdgfra and Pdgfr typical of bone marrow derived perivascular reticular cells but reflect a unique cell type in terms of other gene and marker expression. Their classification as osteoprogenitors is confirmed through ability to undergo osteogenic, but not adipogenic or chondrogenic differentiation. Some stromal lines were shown to form ectopic niches for HSCs following engraftment under the kidney capsule of NOD/SCID mice. The presence of myeloid cells and a higher representation of a specific dendritic-like cell type over other myeloid cells within grafts was consistent with previous in vitro evidence of hematopoietic support capacity. These studies reinforce the role of perivascular/perisinusoidal reticular cells in hematopoiesis and implicate such cells as niches for hematopoiesis in spleen."
https://openalex.org/W2978225078,"2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a toxic man-made chemical compound contaminating the environment and affecting human/animal health and reproduction. Intracellular TCDD action usually involves the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The aim of the current study was to examine TCDD-induced changes in the proteome of AhR-silenced porcine granulosa cells. The AhR-silenced cells were treated with TCDD (100 nM) for 3, 12 or 24 h. Total protein was isolated, labeled with cyanines and next, the samples were separated by isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE. Proteins of interest were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and confirmed by western blotting and fluorescence immunocytochemistry. The AhR-targeted siRNA transfection reduced the granulosal expression level of AhR by 60–70%. In AhR-silenced porcine granulosa cells, TCDD influenced the abundance of only three proteins: annexin V, protein disulfide isomerase and ATP synthase subunit beta. The obtained results revealed the ability of TCDD to alter protein abundance in an AhR-independent manner. This study offers a new insight into the mechanism of TCDD action and provide directions for future functional studies focused on molecular effects exerted by TCDD."
https://openalex.org/W2978242416,"Taste receptor type 1 (T1r) is responsible for the perception of essential nutrients, such as sugars and amino acids, and evoking sweet and umami (savory) taste sensations. T1r receptors recognize many of the taste substances at their extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs). In order to detect a wide array of taste substances in the environment, T1r receptors often possess broad ligand specificities. However, the entire ranges of chemical spaces and their binding characteristics to any T1rLBDs have not been extensively analyzed. In this study, we exploited the differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to medaka T1r2a/T1r3LBD, a current sole T1rLBD heterodimer amenable for recombinant preparation, and analyzed their thermal stabilization by adding various amino acids. The assay showed that the agonist amino acids induced thermal stabilization and shifted the melting temperatures (Tm) of the protein. An agreement between the DSF results and the previous biophysical assay was observed, suggesting that DSF can detect ligand binding at the orthosteric-binding site in T1r2a/T1r3LBD. The assay further demonstrated that most of the tested l-amino acids, but no d-amino acid, induced Tm shifts of T1r2a/T1r3LBD, indicating the broad l-amino acid specificities of the proteins probably with several different manners of recognition. The Tm shifts by each amino acid also showed a fair correlation with the responses exhibited by the full-length receptor, verifying the broad amino-acid binding profiles at the orthosteric site in LBD observed by DSF."
https://openalex.org/W2979101942,"Polyethylene glycol repair (PEG-fusion) of severed sciatic axons restores their axoplasmic and membrane continuity, prevents Wallerian degeneration, maintains muscle fiber innervation, and greatly improves recovery of voluntary behaviors. We examined alterations in spinal connectivity and motoneuron dendritic morphology as one potential mechanism for improved behavioral function after PEG-fusion. At 2–112 days after a single-cut or allograft PEG-fusion repair of transected or ablated sciatic nerves, the number, size, location, and morphology of motoneurons projecting to the tibialis anterior muscle were assessed by retrograde labeling. For both lesion types, labeled motoneurons were found in the appropriate original spinal segment, but also in inappropriate segments, indicating mis-pairings of proximal-distal segments of PEG-fused motor axons. Although the number and somal size of motoneurons was unaffected, dendritic distributions were altered, indicating that PEG-fusion preserves spinal motoneurons but reorganizes their connectivity. This spinal reorganization may contribute to the remarkable behavioral recovery seen after PEG-fusion repair."

We aimed to explore radiologic and clinical factors affecting prognosis and to compare the prognosis of both central and peripheral lung SCCs.Radiologic, clinical, and pathologic profiles of surgically confirmed SCCs from 382 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Tumor location, enhancement, necrosis, the presence of obstructive pneumonitis/atelectasis and underlying lung disease were evaluated on chest CT examination. Age, pulmonary function, tumor marker, and cancer stage were also assessed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify any correlation to overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Hazard rate estimation and competing risk analysis were done to evaluate recurrence pattern.The median follow-up period was 56.2 months. Tumors were located centrally in 230 patients (60.2%) and peripherally in 152 patients (39.8%). Age (p = 0.002, hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.01, 1.06]) and interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) (p<0.001, HR 5.41, 95% CI = [3.08, 9.52]) were associated with poor OS on multivariate analysis. ILAs also had a strong association to DFS (p<0.001, HR 4.25, 95% CI = [3.08, 9.52]). Central cancers had two peaks of local recurrence development at 15 and 60 months after surgery, and peripheral tumors showed rising curves for metastasis development at 60 months.CT-determined ILAs are a strong biomarker predicting poor outcome. Prognosis may not vary according to tumor location, but the two groups exhibited different recurrence patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2978017828,"Propofol causes a profound inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and reduces spare electron transfer chain capacity in a range of human and rodent cells and tissues-a feature that might be related to the pathogenesis of Propofol Infusion Syndrome. We aimed to explore the mechanism of propofol-induced alteration of bioenergetic pathways by describing its kinetic characteristics.We obtained samples of skeletal and cardiac muscle from Wistar rat (n = 3) and human subjects: vastus lateralis from hip surgery patients (n = 11) and myocardium from brain-dead organ donors (n = 10). We assessed mitochondrial functional indices using standard SUIT protocol and high resolution respirometry in fresh tissue homogenates with or without short-term exposure to a range of propofol concentration (2.5-100 μg/ml). After finding concentrations of propofol causing partial inhibition of a particular pathways, we used that concentration to construct kinetic curves by plotting oxygen flux against substrate concentration during its stepwise titration in the presence or absence of propofol. By spectrophotometry we also measured the influence of the same propofol concentrations on the activity of isolated respiratory complexes.We found that human muscle and cardiac tissues are more sensitive to propofol-mediated inhibition of bioenergetic pathways than rat's tissue. In human homogenates, palmitoyl carnitine-driven respiration was inhibited at much lower concentrations of propofol than that required for a reduction of electron transfer chain capacity, suggesting FAO inhibition mechanism different from downstream limitation or carnitine-palmitoyl transferase-1 inhibition. Inhibition of Complex I was characterised by more marked reduction of Vmax, in keeping with non-competitive nature of the inhibition and the pattern was similar to the inhibition of Complex II or electron transfer chain capacity. There was neither inhibition of Complex IV nor increased leak through inner mitochondrial membrane with up to 100 μg/ml of propofol. If measured in isolation by spectrophotometry, propofol 10 μg/ml did not affect the activity of any respiratory complexes.In human skeletal and heart muscle homogenates, propofol in concentrations that are achieved in propofol-anaesthetized patients, causes a direct inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, in addition to inhibiting flux of electrons through inner mitochondrial membrane. The inhibition is more marked in human as compared to rodent tissues."

The participants were selected from among those who had taken part in two clinical studies in the UK using convenient, but purposive sampling. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed; the data analysis was conducted by thematic analysis.GDP's indicated their beliefs that ICDAS had an important role in caries prevention but reported four main barriers while using the full (6 caries stages) ICDAS coding system in their practices: lack of simplicity of coding, financial implications and time consumption (in both training and use of ICDAS) and inadequate undergraduate training. An overarching theme identified from the GDPS was the willingness to offer potential solutions to their barriers which might improve the utilisation of the system in primary care.The GDPs experienced common obstacles in using ICDAS in the primary care setting, many of which have relatively straight-forward solutions which they put forward themselves such as: incentivisation, undergraduate-level training in ICDAS for both dentists and nurses and computerized data entry. Further qualitative and quantitative research is needed on how to facilitate the utilisation of the system in dental practice. It is also recommended to explore the influences of wider agencies on influencing primary dental care professionals' caries management, including appropriate recording of diagnosis and risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2977309962,"In situ gene expression detection is the best way to determine temporal and spatial differences in gene expression. However, in situ hybridization procedures are inherently difficult to execute and typically suffer from degradation of sample tissues, limited sensitivity to genes with low expression, high background, and limitation to single gene detections. We propose to utilize an isothermal gene amplification technique, LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification), to solve these problems in a novel way. LAMP greatly amplifies the signal of expressed genes and can use multiple sets of primers and different fluorescent-labeled probes to produce multiplex gene detection. LAMP is a rapid, isothermal reaction that reduces the handling and degradation of tissue by cutting down on the washing steps required by other methods. Using this technique, we have successfully amplified 3 target genes, have produced positive fluorescent in situ results simultaneously for two genes. We have also demonstrated that LAMP can be used to exploit standard NBT/BCIP (nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3'-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt) detection of single expression. In situ LAMP is a robust and applicable method that can be exploited for detection of gene expression in plant species, as well as in animals and bacteria."

Although deep brain stimulation of the STN alleviates certain motor dysfunction, its specific effect on gait abnormalities remains controversial. This study investigated the long-term changes in locomotion following direct infusions of botulinum toxin-A into the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) to suppress the flow of information from the STN to the GPi in a hemiparkinsonian rat model. Static and dynamic gait parameters were quantified using a CatWalk apparatus. Interestingly, botulinum toxin-A at 0.5 ng significantly reduced only the dynamic gait parameters of hemiparkinsonian rats at 1 week and 1 month post-infusion, while static gait parameters did not change. This study offers new insights into the complexity of basal ganglia in locomotor control and shows the potential of central infusion of botulinum toxin-A as a novel intervention in the study of experimental hemiparkinson's disease."

We previously evaluated the association of CD34+ cells with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events over 23 months, but long-term CVD outcomes in relation to levels of CD34+ cells in patients on maintenance hemodialysis are unclear. Herein, we analyzed the long-term predictive potential levels of CD34+ cells for CVD outcomes and all-cause mortality. Between March 2005 and May 2005, we enrolled 215 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at Nagoya Kyoritsu Hospital and followed them up to 12.8 years. According to the CD34+ cell counts, patients were classified into the lowest, medium, and highest tertiles. Levels of CD34+ cells were analyzed in association with four-point major adverse CV events (MACEs), CVD death, and all-cause mortality. In univariate analysis age, smoking habit, lower geriatric nutrition risk index, lower calcium × phosphate product, and lower intact parathyroid hormone were significantly associated with the lowest tertile. Whereas, in multivariate analysis, age and smoking habit were significantly associated with the lowest tertile. Among 139 (64.7%) patients who died during a mean follow-up period of 8.0 years, 39 (28.1%) patients died from CVD. Patients in the lowest tertile had a significantly lower survival rate than those in the medium and highest tertiles (p ≤ 0.001). Using multivariable analyses, the lowest tertile was significantly associated with four-point MACEs (hazard ratio 1.80, p = 0.023) and CVD death (hazard ratio 2.50, p = 0.011). In conclusion, our long-term observational study revealed that a low level of CD34+ cells in the circulation predicts CVD outcomes among patients on maintenance hemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2978597139,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is an excitatory pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC), homologous to the inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor targeted by pharmaceuticals and endogenous sedatives. Activation of the GABAA receptor by the neurosteroid allopregnanolone can be inhibited competitively by thyroid hormone (L-3,3',5-triiodothyronine, or T3), but modulation of nAChR by T3 or neurosteroids has not been investigated. Here we show that allopregnanolone inhibits the nAChR from Torpedo californica at micromolar concentrations, as do T3 and the anionic neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS). We test for the role of protein and ligand charge in mediated receptor inhibition by varying pH in a narrow range around physiological pH. We find that both T3 and PS become less potent with increasing pH, with remarkably similar trends in IC50 when T3 is neutral at pH < 7.3. After deprotonation of T3 (but no additional deprotonation of PS) at pH 7.3, T3 loses potency more slowly with increasing pH than PS. We interpret this result as indicating the negative charge is not required for inhibition but does increase activity. Finally, we show that both T3 and PS affect nAChR channel desensitization, which may implicate a binding site homologous to one that was recently indicated for accelerated desensitization of the GABAA receptor by PS."
https://openalex.org/W2978978085,"Earth System Models (ESMs) are excellent tools for quantifying many aspects of future climate dynamics but are too computationally expensive to produce large collections of scenarios for downstream users of ESM data. In particular, many researchers focused on the impacts of climate change require large collections of ESM runs to rigorously study the impacts to both human and natural systems of low-frequency high-importance events, such as multi-year droughts. Climate model emulators provide an effective mechanism for filling this gap, reproducing many aspects of ESMs rapidly but with lower precision. The fldgen v1.0 R package quickly generates thousands of realizations of gridded temperature fields by randomizing the residuals of pattern scaling temperature output from any single ESM, retaining the spatial and temporal variance and covariance structures of the input data at a low computational cost. The fldgen v2.0 R package described here extends this capability to produce joint realizations of multiple variables, with a focus on temperature and precipitation in an open source software package available for community use (https://github.com/jgcri/fldgen). This substantially improves the fldgen package by removing the requirement that the ESM variables be normally distributed, and will enable researchers to quickly generate covarying temperature and precipitation data that are synthetic but faithful to the characteristics of the original ESM."
https://openalex.org/W2977950424,"Our decisions have a temporally distributed order, and different choice orders (e.g., choosing preferred items first or last) can lead to vastly different experiences. We previously found two dominant strategies (favorite-first and favorite-last) in a preference-based serial choice setting (the 'sushi problem'). However, it remains unclear why these two opposite behavioral patterns arise: i.e., the mechanisms underlying them. Here we developed a novel serial-choice task, using pictures based on attractiveness, to test for a possible shared mechanism with delay discounting, the 'peak-end' bias (i.e., preference for experienced sequences that end well), or working-memory capacity. We also collected psychological and clinical metric data on personality, depression, anxiety, and emotion regulation. We again found the two dominant selection strategies. However, the results of the delay, peak-end bias, and memory capacity tasks were not related to serial choice, while two key psychological metrics were: emotion regulation and conscientiousness (with agreeableness also marginally related). Favorite-first strategists actually regulated emotions better, suggesting better tolerance of negative outcomes. Whereas participants with more varied strategies across trials were more conscientious (and perhaps agreeable), suggesting that they were less willing to settle for a single, simpler strategy. Our findings clarify mechanisms underlying serial choice and show that it may reflect a unique ability to organize choices into sequences of events."
https://openalex.org/W2979161646,"Background Host-vector contact is a key factor in vectorial capacity assessment and thus the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF), an emerging zoonotic disease of interest in West Africa. The knowledge of the host-feeding patterns of vector species constitutes a key element in the assessment of their epidemiological importance in a given environment. The aim of this work was to identify the blood meal origins of the mosquito Aedes vexans arabiensis, the main vector of RVF virus in the Ferlo pastoral ecosystem of Senegal. Methodology/principal findings Engorged female mosquitoes were collected in Younouféré in the pastoral ecosystem in the Ferlo region during the 2014 rainy season. CO2-baited CDC light traps were set at six points for two consecutive nights every month from July to November. Domestic animals present around traps were identified and counted for each trapping session. Blood meal sources of engorged mosquitoes were identified using a vertebrate-specific multiplexed primer set based on cytochrome b. Blood meal sources were successfully identified for 319 out of 416 blood-fed females (76.68%), of which 163 (51.1%) were single meals, 146 (45.77%) mixed meals from two different hosts and 10 (3.13%) mixed meals from three different hosts. Aedes vexans arabiensis fed preferentially on mammals especially on horse compared to other hosts (FR = 46.83). Proportions of single and mixed meals showed significant temporal and spatial variations according to the availability of the hosts. Conclusion Aedes vexans arabiensis shows an opportunistic feeding behavior depending on the host availability. This species fed preferentially on mammals especially on horses (primary hosts) and ruminants (secondary hosts)."
https://openalex.org/W2978418845,"The effects of gravity on bevacizumab or the recommended head position after intraocular bevacizumab injection have not been reported. To evaluate the effect of gravity on bevacizumab in vitro, we added bevacizumab to the upper part of a test tube filled with balanced salt solution (BSS) and examined its distribution over time.Sixty-four test tubes were divided equally into two groups; group 1 (32, collected from upper part of the tube) and group 2 (32, collected from lower part of the tube). Each test tube was filled with 5 mL BSS before bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 mL) was added, and then stored at 36°C. Bevacizumab concentration in 8 test tubes from each group was measured at 12, 24, 48, and 168 h using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis (ELISA) kit. Mann-Whitney and Jonckheere-Terpstra tests were used for statistical analysis.Bevacizumab concentration was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 at 12, 24, 48, and 168 h (12, 24, 48, and 168 h; P < 0.01 each; Mann-Whitney test). The mean change in bevacizumab concentration over time tended to increase in Group 1 (P < 0.01; Jonckheere-Terpstra test), but tended to decrease in Group 2 (P < 0.01; Jonckheere-Terpstra test).The significant differences in concentration between the upper and lower parts even after a considerable amount of storage time showed that bevacizumab did not dissolve immediately and diffused evenly throughout the solution. It appeared that more bevacizumab settled in the lower part of the tube than in the upper part because of gravitational force. However, the concentration difference between the upper and lower parts decreased as bevacizumab gradually diffused over time, indicating that the difference in concentration due to gravity was more significant at the beginning of bevacizumab injection."
https://openalex.org/W2977302372,"Echolocation is the detection and localization of objects by listening to the sounds they reflect. Early studies of human echolocation used real objects that the experimental leader positioned manually before each experimental trial. The advantage of this procedure is the use of realistic stimuli; the disadvantage is that manually shifting stimuli between trials is very time consuming making it difficult to use psychophysical methods based on the presentation of hundreds of stimuli. The present study tested a new automated system for stimulus presentation, the Echobot, that overcomes this disadvantage. We tested 15 sighted participants with no prior experience of echolocation on their ability to detect the reflection of a loudspeaker-generated click from a 50 cm circular aluminum disk. The results showed that most participants were able to detect the sound reflections. Performance varied considerably, however, with mean individual thresholds of detection ranging from 1 to 3.2 m distance from the disk. Three participants in the loudspeaker experiment also tested using self-generated vocalization. One participant performed better using vocalization and one much worse than in the loudspeaker experiment, illustrating that performance in echolocation experiments using vocalizations not only measures the ability to detect sound reflections, but also the ability to produce efficient echolocation signals. Overall, the present experiments show that the Echobot may be a useful tool in research on human echolocation."
