https://openalex.org/W1990569430,"Objectives Study objectives were to investigate the prevalence and causes of prescribing errors amongst foundation doctors (i.e. junior doctors in their first (F1) or second (F2) year of post-graduate training), describe their knowledge and experience of prescribing errors, and explore their self-efficacy (i.e. confidence) in prescribing. Method A three-part mixed-methods design was used, comprising: prospective observational study; semi-structured interviews and cross-sectional survey. All doctors prescribing in eight purposively selected hospitals in Scotland participated. All foundation doctors throughout Scotland participated in the survey. The number of prescribing errors per patient, doctor, ward and hospital, perceived causes of errors and a measure of doctors' self-efficacy were established. Results 4710 patient charts and 44,726 prescribed medicines were reviewed. There were 3364 errors, affecting 1700 (36.1%) charts (overall error rate: 7.5%; F1:7.4%; F2:8.6%; consultants:6.3%). Higher error rates were associated with : teaching hospitals (p<0.001), surgical (p = <0.001) or mixed wards (0.008) rather thanmedical ward, higher patient turnover wards (p<0.001), a greater number of prescribed medicines (p<0.001) and the months December and June (p<0.001). One hundred errors were discussed in 40 interviews. Error causation was multi-factorial; work environment and team factors were particularly noted. Of 548 completed questionnaires (national response rate of 35.4%), 508 (92.7% of respondents) reported errors, most of which (328 (64.6%) did not reach the patient. Pressure from other staff, workload and interruptions were cited as the main causes of errors. Foundation year 2 doctors reported greater confidence than year 1 doctors in deciding the most appropriate medication regimen. Conclusions Prescribing errors are frequent and of complex causation. Foundation doctors made more errors than other doctors, but undertook the majority of prescribing, making them a key target for intervention. Contributing causes included work environment, team, task, individual and patient factors. Further work is needed to develop and assess interventions that address these."
https://openalex.org/W2013655874,"Crossing over between homologous chromosomes is initiated in meiotic prophase in most sexually reproducing organisms by the appearance of programmed double strand breaks throughout the genome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the double-strand breaks are resected to form three prime single-strand tails that primarily invade complementary sequences in unbroken homologs. These invasion intermediates are converted into double Holliday junctions and then resolved into crossovers that facilitate homolog segregation during Meiosis I. Work in yeast suggests that Msh4-Msh5 stabilizes invasion intermediates and double Holliday junctions, which are resolved into crossovers in steps requiring Sgs1 helicase, Exo1, and a putative endonuclease activity encoded by the DNA mismatch repair factor Mlh1-Mlh3. We purified Mlh1-Mlh3 and showed that it is a metal-dependent and Msh2-Msh3-stimulated endonuclease that makes single-strand breaks in supercoiled DNA. These observations support a direct role for an Mlh1-Mlh3 endonuclease activity in resolving recombination intermediates and in DNA mismatch repair."

Soluble decorin protein core, hereafter referred to as decorin, potently attenuated mitochondrial respiratory complexes and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. We found a rapid and dynamic interplay between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and the decorin-induced tumor suppressor gene, mitostatin. This interaction stabilized mitostatin mRNA with concurrent accumulation of mitostatin protein. In contrast, siRNA-mediated abrogation of PGC-1α-blocked decorin-evoked stabilization of mitostatin. Mechanistically, PGC-1α bound MITOSTATIN mRNA to achieve rapid stabilization. These processes were orchestrated by the decorin/Met axis, as blocking the Met-tyrosine kinase or knockdown of Met abrogated these responses. Furthermore, depletion of mitostatin blocked decorin- or rapamycin-evoked mitophagy, increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) production, and compromised decorin-evoked VEGFA suppression. Collectively, our findings underscore the complexity of PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis and establish mitostatin as a key regulator of tumor cell mitophagy and angiostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2073522519,"Background Cachexia affects the majority of patients with advanced cancer and is associated with a reduction in treatment tolerance, response to therapy, and duration of survival. One impediment towards the effective treatment of cachexia is a validated classification system. Methods 41 patients with resectable upper gastrointestinal (GI) or pancreatic cancer underwent characterisation for cachexia based on weight-loss (WL) and/or low muscularity (LM). Four diagnostic criteria were used >5%WL, >10%WL, LM, and LM+>2%WL. All patients underwent biopsy of the rectus muscle. Analysis included immunohistochemistry for fibre size and type, protein and nucleic acid concentration, Western blots for markers of autophagy, SMAD signalling, and inflammation. Findings Compared with non-cachectic cancer patients, patients with LM or LM+>2%WL, mean muscle fibre diameter was reduced by about 25% (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001 respectively). No significant difference in fibre diameter was observed if patients had WL alone. Regardless of classification, there was no difference in fibre number or proportion of fibre type across all myosin heavy chain isoforms. Mean muscle protein content was reduced and the ratio of RNA/DNA decreased in patients with either >5%WL or LM+>2%WL. Compared with non-cachectic patients, SMAD3 protein levels were increased in patients with >5%WL (p = 0.022) and with >10%WL, beclin (p = 0.05) and ATG5 (p = 0.01) protein levels were increased. There were no differences in phospho-NFkB or phospho-STAT3 levels across any of the groups. Conclusion Muscle fibre size, biochemical composition and pathway phenotype can vary according to whether the diagnostic criteria for cachexia are based on weight loss alone, a measure of low muscularity alone or a combination of the two. For intervention trials where the primary end-point is a change in muscle mass or function, use of combined diagnostic criteria may allow identification of a more homogeneous patient cohort, reduce the sample size required and enhance the time scale within which trials can be conducted."
https://openalex.org/W2019743870,"The box jellyfish Chironex fleckeri produces extremely potent and rapid-acting venom that is harmful to humans and lethal to prey. Here, we describe the characterization of two C. fleckeri venom proteins, CfTX-A (∼40 kDa) and CfTX-B (∼42 kDa), which were isolated from C. fleckeri venom using size exclusion chromatography and cation exchange chromatography. Full-length cDNA sequences encoding CfTX-A and -B and a third putative toxin, CfTX-Bt, were subsequently retrieved from a C. fleckeri tentacle cDNA library. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the new toxins belong to a small family of potent cnidarian pore-forming toxins that includes two other C. fleckeri toxins, CfTX-1 and CfTX-2. Phylogenetic inferences from amino acid sequences of the toxin family grouped CfTX-A, -B, and -Bt in a separate clade from CfTX-1 and -2, suggesting that the C. fleckeri toxins have diversified structurally and functionally during evolution. Comparative bioactivity assays revealed that CfTX-1/2 (25 μg kg(-1)) caused profound effects on the cardiovascular system of anesthetized rats, whereas CfTX-A/B elicited only minor effects at the same dose. Conversely, the hemolytic activity of CfTX-A/B (HU50 = 5 ng ml(-1)) was at least 30 times greater than that of CfTX-1/2. Structural homology between the cubozoan toxins and insecticidal three-domain Cry toxins (δ-endotoxins) suggests that the toxins have a similar pore-forming mechanism of action involving α-helices of the N-terminal domain, whereas structural diversification among toxin members may modulate target specificity. Expansion of the cnidarian toxin family therefore provides new insights into the evolutionary diversification of box jellyfish toxins from a structural and functional perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2090144600,"Solid tumors develop abnormally at spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to biophysical barriers that impact anti-tumor chemotherapy. This may increase the expenditure and time for conventional drug pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. In order to facilitate drug discovery, we propose a mathematical model that couples three-dimensional tumor growth and angiogenesis to simulate tumor progression for chemotherapy evaluation. This application-oriented model incorporates complex dynamical processes including cell- and vascular-mediated interstitial pressure, mass transport, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and vessel maturation to model tumor progression through multiple stages including tumor initiation, avascular growth, and transition from avascular to vascular growth. Compared to pure mechanistic models, the proposed empirical methods are not only easy to conduct but can provide realistic predictions and calculations. A series of computational simulations were conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed comprehensive model. The computational simulation results suggest that solid tumor geometry is related to the interstitial pressure, such that tumors with high interstitial pressure are more likely to develop dendritic structures than those with low interstitial pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1996282847,"The mainstay of treatment for thrombosis, the formation of occlusive platelet aggregates that often lead to heart attack and stroke, is antiplatelet therapy. Antiplatelet therapy dosing and resistance are poorly understood, leading to potential incorrect and ineffective dosing. Shear rate is also suspected to play a major role in thrombosis, but instrumentation to measure its influence has been limited by flow conditions, agonist use, and non-systematic and/or non-quantitative studies. In this work we measured occlusion times and thrombus detachment for a range of initial shear rates (500, 1500, 4000, and 10000 s(-1)) and therapy concentrations (0-2.4 µM for eptifibatide, 0-2 mM for acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA), 3.5-40 Units/L for heparin) using a microfluidic device. We also measured complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet activity using whole blood impedance aggregometry. Effects of shear rate and dose were analyzed using general linear models, logistic regressions, and Cox proportional hazards models. Shear rates have significant effects on thrombosis/dose-response curves for all tested therapies. ASA has little effect on high shear occlusion times, even at very high doses (up to 20 times the recommended dose). Under ASA therapy, thrombi formed at high shear rates were 4 times more prone to detachment compared to those formed under control conditions. Eptifibatide reduced occlusion when controlling for shear rate and its efficacy increased with dose concentration. In contrast, the hazard of occlusion from ASA was several orders of magnitude higher than that of eptifibatide. Our results show similar dose efficacy to our low shear measurements using whole blood aggregometry. This quantitative and statistically validated study of the effects of a wide range of shear rate and antiplatelet therapy doses on occlusive thrombosis contributes to more accurate understanding of thrombosis and to models for optimizing patient treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2145216692,"With over eight million cases of tuberculosis each year there is a pressing need for the development of new vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Subunit vaccines consisting of recombinant proteins are an attractive vaccine approach due to their inherent safety compared to attenuated live vaccines and the uniformity of manufacture. Addition of properly formulated TLR agonist-containing adjuvants to recombinant protein vaccines enhances the antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell response characterized by IFN-γ and TNF, both of which are critical for the control of TB. We have developed a clinical stage vaccine candidate consisting of a recombinant fusion protein ID93 adjuvanted with the TLR4 agonist GLA-SE. Here we examine whether ID93+GLA-SE can be improved by the addition of a second TLR agonist. Addition of CpG containing DNA to ID93+GLA-SE enhanced the magnitude of the multi-functional TH1 response against ID93 characterized by co-production of IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2. Addition of CpG also improved the protective efficacy of ID93+GLA-SE. Finally we demonstrate that this adjuvant synergy between GLA and CpG is independent of TRIF signaling, whereas TRIF is necessary for the adjuvant activity of GLA-SE in the absence of CpG."
https://openalex.org/W1973609430,"Metabolic stress, as well as several antidiabetic agents, increases hepatic nucleotide monophosphate (NMP) levels, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and suppresses glucose production. We tested the necessity of hepatic AMPK for the in vivo effects of an acute elevation in NMP on metabolism. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR; 8 mg·kg(-1)·min(-1))-euglycemic clamps were performed to elicit an increase in NMP in wild type (α1α2(lox/lox)) and liver-specific AMPK knock-out mice (α1α2(lox/lox) + Albcre) in the presence of fixed glucose. Glucose kinetics were equivalent in 5-h fasted α1α2(lox/lox) and α1α2(lox/lox) + Albcre mice. AMPK was not required for AICAR-mediated suppression of glucose production and increased glucose disappearance. These results demonstrate that AMPK is unnecessary for normal 5-h fasting glucose kinetics and AICAR-mediated inhibition of glucose production. Moreover, plasma fatty acids and triglycerides also decreased independently of hepatic AMPK during AICAR administration. Although the glucoregulatory effects of AICAR were shown to be independent of AMPK, these studies provide in vivo support for the AMPK energy sensor paradigm. AICAR reduced hepatic energy charge by ∼20% in α1α2(lox/lox), which was exacerbated by ∼2-fold in α1α2(lox/lox) + Albcre. This corresponded to a ∼6-fold rise in AMP/ATP in α1α2(lox/lox) + Albcre. Consistent with the effects on adenine nucleotides, maximal mitochondrial respiration was ∼30% lower in α1α2(lox/lox) + Albcre than α1α2(lox/lox) livers. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency was reduced by 25%. In summary, these results demonstrate that the NMP capacity to inhibit glucose production in vivo is independent of liver AMPK. In contrast, AMPK promotes mitochondrial function and protects against a more precipitous fall in ATP during AICAR administration."

The C-terminal cytosolic domain of mitoNEET hosts a redox-active [2Fe-2S] cluster via an unusual ligand arrangement of three cysteine residues and one histidine residue. Here we report that human mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters are fully reduced when expressed in Escherichia coli cells. In vitro studies show that purified mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters can be partially reduced by monothiols such as reduced glutathione, l-cysteine or N-acetyl-l-cysteine and fully reduced by dithiothreitol or the E. coli thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system under anaerobic conditions. Importantly, thiol-reduced mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters can be reversibly oxidized by hydrogen peroxide without disruption of the clusters in vitro and in E. coli cells, indicating that mitoNEET may act as a sensor of oxidative signals to regulate mitochondrial functions via its [2Fe-2S] clusters.

Because the cytosolic redox potential in eukaryotic cells is estimated to be around −325 mV (pH 7.0) (23.Dooley C.T. Dore T.M. Hanson G.T. Jackson W.C. Remington S.J. Tsien R.Y.

Nevertheless, the redox state of the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters in cells has not been demonstrated, and specific cellular components that may reduce the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters have not been identified. Here we report that human mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters are in the fully reduced state when expressed in E. coli cells under normal growth conditions and that purified mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters can be partially reduced by monothiols such as reduced glutathione, l-cysteine, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine and fully reduced by dithiothreitol and the E. coli thioredoxin-1 reduced by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. Importantly, the reduced mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters can be reversibly oxidized by hydrogen peroxide without disruption of the clusters, indicating that the redox state of the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters can be modulated by biological thiols and oxidative signals. Furthermore, we find that the type II diabetes drug pioglitazone can effectively inhibit the thiol-mediated reduction of the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters in vitro, suggesting that pioglitazone may modulate the function of mitoNEET by blocking the thiol-mediated reduction of the [2Fe-2S] clusters in the protein. The gene encoding human mitoNEET33–108 (containing amino acid residues 33–108) was cloned previously from the human cDNA library as described in Ref. 14.Tan G. Landry A.P. Dai R. Wang L. Lu J.

The mitoNEET mutant in which histidine 87 was substituted with cysteine (H87C) was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The constructed mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing (Operon Co.). Human mitoNEET and the mitoNEET mutant proteins were prepared following procedures described previously (14.Tan G.

The purity of purified proteins was greater than 95%, as judged by electrophoresis analysis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. The protein concentration of purified mitoNEET or the mitoNEET mutant H87C was measured at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 8.6 mm−1cm−1. The protein concentration of thioredoxin-1 and thioredoxin reductase was determined at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 14.2 and 17.7 mm−1cm−1, respectively. A Beckman DU640 UV-visible spectrometer equipped with a temperature control was used for measuring absorption spectra. Pioglitazone, l-cysteine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, reduced glutathione, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, NADPH, kanamycin, ampicillin, and dithiothreitol were from Research Product International Co. Pioglitazone was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as a stock solution containing 25 mm pioglitazone. An equal amount of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the samples as a control. For whole-cell EPR measurements, E. coli cells were grown for 2 h before the recombinant protein expression was induced. After 2 h of protein expression, cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and resuspended in phosphate buffer or fresh LB medium. An aliquot (350 μl) of the E. coli cells was then transferred to the EPR tube and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. For the reduced samples, freshly prepared sodium dithionite was added to the E. coli cells before the EPR samples were prepared. For protein sample preparation, purified mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters dissolved in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl were purged with pure argon gas in sealed vials for 15 min before reductant was added under anaerobic conditions. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, samples were transferred to the EPR tubes and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The X-band EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker model ESR-300 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments 910 continuous flow cryostat. Routine EPR conditions were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.47 GHz; microwave power, 10.0 milliwatt; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1.2 millitesla; temperature, 20 K; receive gain, 105. Purified human mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters are in an oxidized state and have no EPR signals (Fig. 1A). When purified mitoNEET [2Fe-2S]] clusters are reduced with sodium dithionite (Em7 = -600 mV (27.Mayhew S.G.

The gx, gy, and gz values represent the anisotropic g-factors of a typical [2Fe-2S] cluster in proteins. In parallel, we also prepared the mitoNEET mutant H87C, in which the unique ligand His-87 of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is replaced with Cys. Although purified mitoNEET H87C has no EPR signal, addition of sodium dithionite produces a new rhombic EPR spectrum of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, with gx = 1.896, gy = 1.970, and gz = 1.992, that is distinct from that of the wild-type mitoNEET (Fig. 1A). The EPR measurement provides an efficient and non-intrusive approach to determine the redox state of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins in solutions or in whole cells (30.Ding H. Demple B.

Here, we took the advantage of EPR to explore the redox state of the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters expressed in E. coli cells. Fig. 1B shows that E. coli cells without any recombinant proteins have very little or no EPR signals because of low concentrations of endogenous iron-sulfur proteins in cells (30.Ding H. Demple B. In vivo kinetics of a redox-regulated transcriptional switch.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8445-8449Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 31.Djaman O. Outten F.W. Imlay J.A. Repair of oxidized iron-sulfur clusters in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44590-44599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Under the same experimental conditions, E. coli cells expressing human mitoNEET show a rhombic EPR signal at g = 1.94, which is identical to that of the reduced mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters (Fig. 1A). In contrast, E. coli cells expressing the mitoNEET mutant H87C do not have any EPR signals (Fig. 1B), although both mitoNEET and the mitoNEET mutant H87C are expressed similarly in E. coli cells on the basis of SDS-PAGE gel analysis (data not shown). This is likely because the mutation of His-87 to Cys shifts the Em7 value of the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters from 0 to −320 mV (11.Bak D.W. Zuris J.A. Paddock M.L. Jennings P.A. Elliott S.J. Redox characterization of the FeS protein MitoNEET and impact of thiazolidinedione drug binding.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10193-10195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the cytosolic redox potential of E. coli cells is about −260 mV (32.Gaudu P. Weiss B. SoxR, a [2Fe-2S] transcription factor, is active only in its oxidized form.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the mitoNEET mutant H87C [2Fe-2S] clusters would be mostly in an oxidized (EPR-silent) state in E. coli cells. To further examine the redox state of the [2Fe-2S] clusters in wild-type mitoNEET and the mitoNEET mutant H87C expressed in E. coli cells, excess sodium dithionite is added to the cells to reduce all iron-sulfur proteins. Fig. 1C shows that addition of sodium dithionite to E. coli cells without recombinant proteins does not produce any new EPR signals. On the other hand, addition of sodium dithionite to E. coli cells expressing the mitoNEET mutant H87C generates an EPR signal at g = 1.97, which is the same as that of the reduced mitoNEET mutant H87C [2Fe-2S] clusters (Fig. 1A). Thus, the oxidized [2Fe-2S] clusters in the mitoNEET mutant H87C in E. coli cells can be reduced by sodium dithionite. In contrast, the EPR signal at g = 1.94 of the E. coli cells expressing the wild-type mitoNEET is not changed by addition of sodium dithionite, suggesting that the wild-type mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters are fully reduced in E. coli cells even before the addition of sodium dithionite. Because the cytosolic redox potential in eukaryotic cells (-325 mV (23.Dooley C.T. Dore T.M. Hanson G.T. Jackson W.C. Remington S.J. Tsien R.Y. Imaging dynamic redox changes in mammalian cells with green fluorescent protein indicators.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22284-22293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar)) is about 65 mV lower than that in E. coli cells (-260 mV (32.Gaudu P. Weiss B. SoxR, a [2Fe-2S] transcription factor, is active only in its oxidized form.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)), we postulate that the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters are most likely in a reduced state in human cells under physiological conditions. Although it has been shown that the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters are redox-active (11.Bak D.W. Zuris J.A. Paddock M.L. Jennings P.A. Elliott S.J.

Comparison to the (Cys)(4) mutant and implications of the effects of pH on the labile metal center.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4747-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), specific biological molecules that can reduce or oxidize the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters are unknown. Because the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters are fully reduced in E. coli cells, we reason that the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters may be reduced by cellular reducing components that are common in both human and E. coli cells. However, NADPH is not one of them because NADPH fails to reduce the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters in vitro (21.Zuris J.A. Ali S.S. Yeh H. Nguyen T.A. Nechushtai R. Paddock M.L. Jennings P.A. NADPH inhibits [2Fe-2S] cluster protein transfer from diabetes drug target MitoNEET to an apo-acceptor protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 11649-11655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Among other cellular reducing components, biological thiols are abundant. More importantly, biological thiols are able to form relatively stable intermediate thiol free radicals (33.Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Pathways of peroxynitrite oxidation of thiol groups.Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 34.Eaton P. Protein thiol oxidation in health and disease. Techniques for measuring disulfides and related modifications in complex protein mixtures.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1889-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) that can potentially provide electrons for the single-electron reduction of the oxidized [2Fe-2S] clusters in mitoNEET. To test this idea, purified mitoNEET was incubated with thiols under anaerobic conditions. After incubation, the samples were subjected to EPR and UV-visible absorption measurements. The reduced mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters were observed from the EPR signal at g = 1.94, and the UV-visible absorption peaks at 420 and 550 nm. As shown in Fig. 2, all biological thiols tested (reduced glutathione, l-cysteine, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine) are able to partially reduce the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters. Reduced glutathione appears to have the least ability to reduce the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters. l-cysteine and N-acetyl-l-cysteine are able to reduce about 50% of the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters in solution under anaerobic conditions, in comparison with the fully reduced mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters by sodium dithionite. A further increase of l-cysteine concentration (up to 50-fold excess over the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters) or incubation time (up to 60 min) does not increase the amount of the reduced mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters in the incubation solution (data not shown), suggesting that l-cysteine could not fully reduce the mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters under the experimental conditions. Interestingly, incubation wi"

We previously showed that a chicken homolog of mammalian Opn5 (Opn5m) is a Gi-coupled UV sensor having molecular properties typical of bistable pigments. Here we demonstrated that mammalian Opn5m evolved to be a more specialized photosensor by losing one of the characteristics of bistable pigments, direct binding of all-trans-retinal. We first confirmed that Opn5m proteins in zebrafish, Xenopus tropicalis, mouse, and human are also UV-sensitive pigments. Then we found that only mammalian Opn5m proteins lack the ability to directly bind all-trans-retinal. Mutational analysis showed that these characteristics were acquired by a single amino acid replacement at position 168. By comparing the expression patterns of Opn5m between mammals and chicken, we found that, like chicken Opn5m, mammalian Opn5m was localized in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer of the retina. However, the mouse and primate (common marmoset) opsins were distributed not in the posterior hypothalamus (including the region along the third ventricle) where chicken Opn5m is localized, but in the preoptic hypothalamus. Interestingly, RPE65, an essential enzyme for forming 11-cis-retinal in the visual cycle is expressed near the preoptic hypothalamus of the mouse and common marmoset brain but not near the region of the chicken brain where chicken Opn5m is expressed. Therefore, mammalian Opn5m may work exclusively as a short wavelength sensor in the brain as well as in the retina with the assistance of an 11-cis-retinal-supplying system.

Opsins are the universal photosensitive proteins responsible for visual and nonvisual photoreception in animals and are G protein-coupled receptors having a seven-transmembrane α-helical structure. They contain vitamin A-derivative retinal as their light-absorbing chromophore, and the retinal binds to a conserved lysine residue located at the center of helix VII through a Schiff base linkage. A variety of opsins have been identified so far and are classified into at least seven groups according to their sequence similarity (1.Koyanagi M. Terakita A. Gq-coupled rhodopsin subfamily composed of invertebrate visual pigment and melanopsin.Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; 84: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2.Shichida Y. Matsuyama T. Evolution of opsins and phototransduction.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 2881-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Opn5 is the most recently identified opsin in the human and mouse genomes (3.Tarttelin E.E. Bellingham J. Hankins M.W. Foster R.G. Lucas R.J. Neuropsin (Opn5). A novel opsin identified in mammalian neural tissue.FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and is categorized in an independent group on the basis of its low sequence homology to the other opsin groups. Opn5 genes have been identified in various vertebrates from fishes to primates and are classified into several subgroups (4.Ohuchi H. Yamashita T. Tomonari S. Fujita-Yanagibayashi S. Sakai K. Noji S. Shichida Y.

Takagi A. Noji S. Ohuchi H. Expression patterns of the opsin 5-related genes in the developing chicken retina.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 1910-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Most mammals have only one Opn5 gene (Opn5m), whereas nonmammalian vertebrates have additional Opn5 genes. This is probably because of the nocturnal period in the early evolution of mammals, during which mammals lost several nonvisual opsins as well as color opsin genes (6.Kuraku S. Kuratani S. Genome-wide detection of gene extinction in early mammalian evolution.Genome Biol. Evol. 2011; 3: 1449-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In our previous reports, we succeeded in the purification of recombinant Opn5 proteins obtained by the expression of chicken Opn5 genes and reported that these proteins are UV-sensitive bistable pigments that activate the Gi type of G protein (4.Ohuchi H. Yamashita T. Tomonari S. Fujita-Yanagibayashi S. Sakai K. Noji S. Shichida Y.

We also speculated from the complete conservation of the amino acid residues surrounding the chromophore between chicken and mammalian Opn5m proteins that mammalian Opn5m proteins should be UV-sensitive pigments, which was recently confirmed in mouse and human Opn5m proteins (8.Kojima D. Mori S. Torii M. Wada A. Morishita R. Fukada Y. UV-sensitive photoreceptor protein OPN5 in humans and mice.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e26388Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the present study, we compared the molecular properties of Opn5m proteins from zebrafish (fish), Xenopus tropicalis (amphibian), chicken (bird), mouse (mammal), and human (primate), paying particular attention to the differences between mammals and nonmammalian vertebrates. In addition, we also analyzed the expression patterns of mouse and primate (common marmoset) Opn5m and RPE65, an enzyme essential for generating 11-cis-retinal in the visual cycle (9.Cai X.

Fertilized chicken eggs (Gallus gallus domesticus) were purchased from a commercial farm (Goto-furanjyo, Inc., Gifu, Japan) and incubated at 37.5 °C in a humidified incubator until hatching. Posthatch chicks were housed under a 12:12 light-dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. Postnatal and adult mice were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Animal Center (ICR and C57BL/6 strains; Shizuoka, Japan). Animals were anesthetized and euthanized at Zeitgeber time 6–10. The eyes and brains of common marmosets were obtained through the Cooperation Research Program of Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University. The use of animals in these experiments was in accordance with the guidelines established by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan and University of Tokushima and Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine (chick; mouse, Mus musculus domesticus) and Kyoto University (common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus). The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Tokushima (permits 08089, 11091, and 11120), Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine (permit M22-197), and Kyoto University (permits 2011-142 and 2012-B-35). All surgery was performed under deep anesthesia (pentobarbital, 100 mg/kg of body weight), and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Efficient selection for high-expression transfectants with a novel eukaryotic vector.Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were introduced by the QuikChange kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's method. The plasmid DNA was transfected into HEK293 cells using the calcium phosphate method. After 1 day of incubation, 11-cis- or all-trans-retinal was added to the medium (final retinal concentration, 5 μm) (7.Yamashita T. Ohuchi H. Tomonari S. Ikeda K. Sakai K. Shichida Y.

The expression levels of human and Xenopus Opn5m proteins were very low, and thus to obtain sufficient amounts of recombinant proteins, we truncated 37 and 21 amino acid residues from the C terminus of human and Xenopus Opn5m proteins, respectively. n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) retinal pigment epithelium postnatal day n paraventricular organ. Absorption spectra were recorded at 10 °C (for human and mouse Opn5m proteins) or 0 °C (for Xenopus and zebrafish Opn5m proteins) with a Shimadzu UV-2400 spectrophotometer. The sample was irradiated with UV light through a UV-D35 glass filter (Asahi Technoglass), with yellow light through a Y-52 cutoff filter (Toshiba) or with orange light through an O-57 cutoff filter (Toshiba) from a 1 kW halogen lamp (Master HILUX-HR; Rikagaku). The absorption spectra of visible and UV light-absorbing forms of Opn5m proteins were calculated using the methods previously described (7.Yamashita T. Ohuchi H. Tomonari S. Ikeda K. Sakai K. Shichida Y. Opn5 is a UV-sensitive bistable pigment that couples with Gi subtype of G protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22084-22089Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, the spectral region at wavelengths longer than the maximum of the main peak of the spectrum difference between the visible and UV light-absorbing forms of the pigment was best fitted with a template spectrum previously described (12.Govardovskii V.I.

Photoreceptor spectral sensitivities. Common shape in the long-wavelength region.Vision Res. 1995; 35: 3083-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The best fitting spectrum was considered to be the visible light-absorbing form of the pigment. The absorption spectrum of the UV light-absorbing form was then calculated by adding the visible light-absorbing form to the difference spectrum. The chromophore configurations of the sample were analyzed by HPLC (LC-10AT VP; Shimadzu) equipped with a silica column (150 × 6 mm, A-012–3; YMC) according to the previous report (14.Tsutsui K.

A radionucleotide filter binding assay, which measures GDP/GTPγS exchange by G protein, was performed as described previously (4.Ohuchi H. Yamashita T. Tomonari S. Fujita-Yanagibayashi S. Sakai K. Noji S. Shichida Y.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22084-22089Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 0 °C. The assay mixture consisted of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% DM, 1 μm [35S]GTPγS, and 2 μm GDP. Mouse Opn5m pigments after reconstitution with 11-cis-retinal were purified in 0.02% DM in buffer A for the assay. Purified mouse Opn5m pigments (final concentration, 300 nm) were mixed with G protein solution (final concentration, 600 nm) and were kept in the dark or irradiated with UV light for 1 min or with subsequent yellow light (>500 nm) for 1 min. After irradiation, the GDP/GTPγS exchange reaction was initiated by the addition of [35S]GTPγS solution to the mixture of the pigment and G protein. After incubation for the indicated time in the dark, an aliquot (20 μl) was removed from the sample into 200 μl of stop solution (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GTPγS, and 2 μm GDP), and it was immediately filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane to trap [35S]GTPγS bound to G proteins. The amount of bound [35S]GTPγS was quantitated by assaying the membrane with a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2910 TR; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specific antibodies were raised to the N terminus of mouse Opn5m and the C terminus of human Opn5m using guinea pigs. Each polyclonal antibody was commercially produced against a 15-amino acid synthetic peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by Protein Purify Ltd. (Gunma, Japan), according to their standard procedures (mouse Opn5m, MALNHTALPQDERLPC; human Opn5m, CVRKSSAVLEIHEEWE). We confirmed that the sequence of this portion of human Opn5m (the C terminus) is identical to that of common marmoset Opn5m deposited in the public database. We also confirmed that this isoform of human Opn5m cDNA was isolated from human retina cDNA (Marathon-Ready cDNA; Clontech) with 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. These antibodies were affinity-purified prior to use by Protein Purify Ltd. The primary antibodies used in this study included guinea pig anti-chick Opn5m antibody (7.Yamashita T. Ohuchi H. Tomonari S. Ikeda K. Sakai K. Shichida Y. Opn5 is a UV-sensitive bistable pigment that couples with Gi subtype of G protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22084-22089Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and rabbit anti-RPE65 antibody (a gift from Dr. Rosalie K. Crouch, Medical University of South Carolina) (15.Tang P.H.

We performed Western blotting analysis using the antibodies and confirmed that the anti-mouse and human/monkey Opn5m antibodies recognized the recombinant proteins of full-length mouse and human Opn5m expressed in HEK293 cells, respectively (Fig. 1). The secondary antibody used for immunostaining in this study was Alexa Fluor 488 anti-guinea pig IgG (A-11073; Invitrogen). The animals were perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS under deep pentobarbital anesthesia, and the eye and brain were quickly dissected, postfixed for 2–3 h (for eyes) or 16 h (for brain) in the same fixative at 4 °C and then transferred to 20% sucrose until they sank. After embedding the samples in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura, Japan), the tissues were sectioned with a cryostat (Leica) at 20-μm thickness. Sections were thaw-mounted onto Matsunami adhesive silane-coated slides (Matsunami, Japan), dried in air for a few hours, and stored at −30 °C until use. The anatomy of the chick, mouse, and common marmoset brain was determined according to Refs. 16.Puelles L.

Fluorescent immunolabeling was performed using standard techniques. Briefly, all slides were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBS Triton X-100 (0.25%) (PBST) with 5% serum from the same species as the corresponding secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST with 5% serum and secondary antibodies in PBS. All wash steps were performed three times with PBST for 5 min each. Primary antibodies (anti-N terminus of mouse Opn5m (diluted 1:2000), anti-C terminus of human Opn5m (diluted 1:2000), and anti-RPE65 (diluted 1:140) were incubated for 5 h at room temperature or for 16 h at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature and diluted 1:750. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The slides were mounted with anti-fade mountant, Vectashield (Vector, H-1500). Fluorescent images were collected using a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal laser-scanning microscope with excitation at 405, 488, and 543 nm and emission wavelengths of 424–489, 505–539, and 551–618 nm for DAPI, green, and Cy3, respectively. Frozen sections (20-μm thickness) of mouse (ICR, postnatal days 0, 4, and 10 and 8 weeks, female; C57BL/6, 8 weeks, male and female) and adult common marmoset brain and retina were used. In situ hybridization was performed according to standard procedures. Briefly, digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were synthesized from full-length cDNA of mouse Opn5m (purchased from IMAGE cDNA Collection), common marmoset Opn5m (GenBankTM accession number XM_002746623, synthesized by Medical & Biological Laboratories, Japan), mouse Rpe65 (GenBankTM accession number AF410461, cloned by PCR from mouse eye), and human Rpe65 (GenBankTM accession number BC075035, purchased from IMAGE cDNA Collection) using T7 T3 or Sp6 RNA polymerase. Sections were pretreated with methanol for 2 h and with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 40 min at room temperature. After prehybridization, sections were incubated with digoxigenin-labeled RNA antisense or sense probes (15∼30 ng/ml in hybridization buffer) at 65 °C overnight. They were washed with 1× SSC buffer containing 50% formamide three times at 65 °C and maleic acid buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and subsequently incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:2000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100; Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C. Color was developed with BCIP/NBP. Sections were coverslipped and observed under a microscope. Extract from full-length human or mouse Opn5m-transfected HEK293 cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-human or mouse Opn5m antibody (1:1000) (Fig. 1). Protein extracts from mouse tissues were prepared as follows (8.Kojima D. Mori S. Torii M. Wada A. Morishita R. Fukada Y. UV-sensitive photoreceptor protein OPN5 in humans and mice.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e26388Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Eight-week-old male mice were anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold PBS. The tissues were dissected and solubilized in 1% DM in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mg/ml aprotinin, 4 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected for SDS-PAGE. Mouse Opn5m or RPE65 in the extracts from mouse neural retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), hypothalamus, other brain area, lung, and liver was detected by anti-mouse Opn5m (1:1500) or RPE65 antibody (1:1000) (see Fig. 7, O and P). We first expressed recombinant proteins of Opn5m from four vertebrates, zebrafish, X. tropicalis, mouse, and human, in cultured cells and examined whether or not these pigments have molecular properties similar to those of chicken Opn5m. As already reported, chicken Opn5m is a UV-sensitive bistable pigment that forms 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal bound states, the latter of which activates the Gi type of G protein (7.Yamashita T. Ohuchi H. Tomonari S. Ikeda K. Sakai K. Shichida Y. Opn5 is a UV-sensitive bistable pigment that couples with Gi subtype of G protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22084-22089Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We also found that, although the apoprotein of Opn5m protein is extremely unstable, we could successfully obtain adequate amounts of chicken Opn5m pigment by adding 11-cis- or all-trans-retinal to the culture medium during the protein expression. Fig. 2C shows the photoreactions of chicken Opn5m that had been purified after incubation with 11-cis-retinal. The absorption spectrum of purified pigment exhibited UV and visible absorbances, indicating that the chicken Opn5m protein binds 11-cis-retinal to produce a UV light-absorbing form and also binds all-trans-retinal, which is formed by thermal isomerization of 11-cis-retinal in culture medium, to produce a visible light-absorbing form (Fig. 2H) (7.Yamashita T. Ohuchi H. Tomonari S. Ikeda K. Sakai K. Shichida Y. Opn5 is a UV-sensitive bistable pigment that couples with Gi subtype of G protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22084-22089Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). UV light irradiation of the pigment caused the conversion of the UV light-absorbing form to the visible light-absorbing form, and subsequent yellow light irradiation resulted in the complete conversion of the visible light-absorbing form to the UV light-absorbing form. The light-induced interconversion between the UV light- and visible light-absorbing forms could be observed repeatedly (Fig. 2C). We performed similar experiments using zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse and human Opn5m proteins (Fig. 2, A, B, D, and E). The absorption spectra and photoreactions of zebrafish and Xenopus Opn5m were quite similar to those of chicken Opn5m. That is, the addition of 11-cis-retinal to the culture medium caused the production of UV light- and visible light-absorbing forms that were interconvertible by light (Fig. 2, D and E). In contrast, incubation of mouse and human Opn5m proteins with 11-cis-retinal in the culture medium caused the production of only the UV light-absorbing form. In fact, UV light irradiation of mouse and human pigments caused the production of the visible-light absorbing form, and subsequent yellow light irradiation resulted in the production of the UV-light absorbing form, whose absorption spectrum overlapped with that of the dark state (Fig. 2, A and B). The analysis of the retinal configurations of human Opn5m also showed that human Opn5m was exclusively reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal, and UV light irradiation induced the retinal isomerization from 11-cis to all-trans form (Fig. 2K). Therefore, mouse and human Opn5m showed photoreversibility similar to that of chicken Opn5m but had no ability to directly bind all-trans-retinal. The absorption maxima of the UV light-absorbing forms of these Opn5m proteins are all located at 360 nm (Fig. 2, insets). In contrast, whereas the absorption maxima of visible light-absorbing forms of zebrafish, Xenopus, and chicken Opn5m proteins are located at 474 nm, those of mouse and human Opn5m proteins are located at 469 nm (Fig. 2, insets). These differences would reflect the differences of the ability to bind all-trans-retinal among these Opn5m proteins. To confirm that mammalian Opn5m has no ability to directly bind all-trans-retinal, we performed similar expression experiments in the presence of all-trans-retinal instead of 11-cis-retinal in the culture medium (Fig. 2, F–J). In zebrafish and Xenopus Opn5m proteins, we observed the production of visible light-absorbing forms that exhibited photoreactions identical to that of chicken Opn5m (Fig. 2, H–J). On the other hand, we observed no pigments of mouse or human Opn5m under the present conditions (Fig. 2, F and G). These results clearly showed that mammalian Opn5m proteins have no ability to directly bind all-trans-retinal. We also confirmed that the visible light-absorbing form of mammalian Opn5m is the active state that couples with Gi (Fig. 3). Purified mouse Opn5m reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal activated Gi in a UV light-dependent manner and lost the activity after subsequent yellow light irradiation. These alterations of the activity are consistent with the spectral changes shown in Fig. 2B, indicating that the visible light-absorbing form is the state-activating G protein. Next, we attempted to identify the amino acid residue(s) whose substitution(s) resulted in a loss of the ability to directly bind all-trans-retinal in mammalian Opn5m proteins. Comparison of the amino acid residues within 4.5 Å from the retinal, which are inferred from the three-dimensional structures of bovine and squid rhodopsins (19.Murakami M. Kouyama T. Crystal structure of squid rhodopsin.Nature. 2008; 453: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 20.Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), indicates that all the residues are completely conserved in mammalian and chicken Opn5m proteins. Thus, we compared the residues within 8 Å from the retinal among vertebrate Opn5m proteins. There are four residues that are conserved in human and mouse Opn5m proteins but not in nonmammalian Opn5m proteins (Table 1). We introduced each corresponding mutation (T94S, T168A, D177S, or I204V in the bovine rhodopsin numbering system) into mouse Opn5m and analyzed the alteration of the ability of direct incorporation of all-trans-retinal. Orange light irradiation of mouse Opn5m mutants incubated with all-trans-retinal led to a significant spectral change in T168A mutant, but not in wild type or other mutants (Fig. 4A). The purified mouse Opn5m T168A had the peak of its absorption spectrum in the visible region and was photoconverted into a pigment whose absorption maximum was in the UV region (Fig. 4B). This spectral change is the same as those observed in nonmammalian Opn5m proteins reconstituted with all-trans-retinal. It should be noted that T168A mutation of mouse Opn5m resulted in red shift of absorption maximum, close to those of nonmammalian Opn5m proteins. These results indicated that T168A mutation alters the all-trans-retinal binding ability as well as the electrostatic environment of the all-trans-retinal chromophore. In addition, we prepared A168T mutant of Xenopus Opn5m reconstituted with all-trans-retinal. The purified mutant exhibited no detectable peak of the absorption spectrum in the visible region and no spectral change after yellow light irradiation (Fig. 4B). Thus, this mutant lost the ability to directly bind all-trans-retinal. These data clearly showed that a single amino acid residue can modulate the ability of direct incorporation of all-trans-retinal as well as the electrostatic environment of the all-trans-retinal chromophore.TABLE 1Comparison of the amino acid residues among vertebrate Opn5m proteinsResidue no.Bovine rhodopsinaNCBI accession numbers of opsin sequences are as follows: bovine rhodopsin, K00506; squid rhodopsin, X70498; platypus Opn5m, XM_001511941; and opossum Opn5m, XM_001369165.Squid rhodopsinZebrafish Opn5mXenopus Opn5mChicken Opn5mPlatypus/opossum Opn5mMouse/human Opn5m94bAmino acid residue numbers are designated using the bovine rhodopsin numbering system.TMFASTT168AAAAAAT177RANNSND204VIVVVIIa NCBI accession numbers of opsin sequences are as follows: bovine rhodopsin, K00506; squid rhodopsin, X70498; platypus Opn5m, XM_001511941; and opossum Opn5m, XM_001369165.b Amino acid residue numbers are designated using the bovine rhodopsin numbering system."
https://openalex.org/W2026967593,"Background The risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) following the United States' 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign in the USA led to enhanced active surveillance during the pandemic influenza (A(H1N1)pdm09) immunization campaign. This study aimed to estimate the risk of GBS following influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination. Methods A self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis was performed in Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Information was collected according to a common protocol and standardised procedures. Cases classified at levels 1–4a of the Brighton Collaboration case definition were included. The risk window was 42 days starting the day after vaccination. Conditional Poisson regression and pooled random effects models estimated adjusted relative incidences (RI). Pseudo likelihood and vaccinated-only methods addressed the potential contraindication for vaccination following GBS. Results Three hundred and three (303) GBS and Miller Fisher syndrome cases were included. Ninety-nine (99) were exposed to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination, which was most frequently adjuvanted (Pandemrix and Focetria). The unadjusted pooled RI for A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination and GBS was 3.5 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.2–5.5), based on all countries. This lowered to 2.0 (95% CI: 1.2–3.1) after adjustment for calendartime and to 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1–3.2) when we accounted for contra-indications. In a subset (Netherlands, Norway, and United Kingdom) we further adjusted for other confounders and there the RI decreased from 1.7 (adjusted for calendar month) to 1.4 (95% CI: 0.7–2.8), which is the main finding. Conclusion This study illustrates the potential of conducting European collaborative vaccine safety studies. The main, fully adjusted analysis, showed that the RI of GBS was not significantly elevated after influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination (RI = 1.4 (95% CI: 0.7–2.8). Based on the upper limits of the pooled estimate we can rule out with 95% certainty that the number of excess GBS cases after influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination would be more than 3 per million vaccinated."
https://openalex.org/W1968765462,"DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoints work in concert to help maintain genomic integrity. In vivo data suggest that these two global responses to DNA damage are coupled. It has been proposed that the canonical 30 nucleotide single-stranded DNA gap generated by nucleotide excision repair is the signal that activates the ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint response and that the signal is enhanced by gap enlargement by EXO1 (exonuclease 1) 5' to 3' exonuclease activity. Here we have used purified core nucleotide excision repair factors (RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, and XPF-ERCC1), core DNA damage checkpoint proteins (ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, RPA), and DNA damaged by a UV-mimetic agent to analyze the basic steps of DNA damage checkpoint response in a biochemically defined system. We find that checkpoint signaling as measured by phosphorylation of target proteins by the ATR kinase requires enlargement of the excision gap generated by the excision repair system by the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity of EXO1. We conclude that, in addition to damaged DNA, RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, XPF-ERCC1, ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, and EXO1 constitute the minimum essential set of factors for ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint response."

Our previous researches indicated that LRRC4 is a target gene of miR-381, the interaction of miR-381 and LRRC4 is involved in glioma growth. In this study, we demonstrate that LRRC4 is a target gene of the other microRNA, miR-182. We found that the high expression of miR-182 and miR-381 in gliomas are involved in pathological malignant progression. The silencing of miR-182 and miR-381 inhibited the proliferation in vitro and growth of glioma cell with in vivo magnetic resonance imaging by intracranial transplanted tumor model in rats. We also demonstrated that BRD7, a transcriptional cofactor for p53, is highly expressed and negatively correlated with LRRC4 expression in gliomas. Disturbing miR-182 and miR-381 affected transcriptional regulation of the BRD7 gene. This finding was verified by ectopic overexpression of LRRC4 or restoration of endogenous LRRC4 expression by treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza-dC. Taken together, miR-182 and miR-381 may be a useful therapeutic target for treatment of glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2013472204,"Mutations in the CSF3 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor CSF3R have recently been found in a large percentage of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia and, more rarely, in other types of leukemia. These CSF3R mutations fall into two distinct categories: membrane-proximal mutations and truncation mutations. Although both classes of mutation have exhibited the capacity for cellular transformation, several aspects of this transformation, including the kinetics, the requirement for ligand, and the dysregulation of downstream signaling pathways, have all been shown to be discrepant between the mutation types, suggesting distinct mechanisms of activation. CSF3R truncation mutations induce overexpression and ligand hypersensitivity of the receptor, likely because of the removal of motifs necessary for endocytosis and degradation. In contrast, little is known about the mechanism of activation of membrane-proximal mutations, which are much more commonly observed in chronic neutrophilic leukemia. In contrast with CSF3R truncation mutations, membrane-proximal mutations do not exhibit overexpression and are capable of signaling in the absence of ligand. We show that the Thr-615 and Thr-618 sites of membrane-proximal mutations are part of an O-linked glycosylation cluster. Mutation at these sites prevents O-glycosylation of CSF3R and increases receptor dimerization. This increased dimerization explains the ligand-independent activation of CSF3R membrane-proximal mutations. Cytokine receptor activation through loss of O-glycosylation represents a novel avenue of aberrant signaling. Finally, the combination of the CSF3R membrane proximal and truncation mutations, as has been reported in some patients, leads to enhanced cellular transformation when compared with either mutation alone, underscoring their distinct mechanisms of action."

However, it is not clear how this activity of Otub1 is regulated in cells. Here we report that Otub1 is monoubiquitinated by UbcH5 in cells and in vitro, primarily at the lysine 59 and 109 residues. This monoubiquitination, in turn, contributes to the activity of Otub1 to suppress UbcH5. The lysine-free Otub1 mutant (Otub1K0) fails to be monoubiquitinated and is unable to suppress the Ub-conjugating activity of UbcH5 in vitro and the MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in cells. Consistently, this mutant is unable to stabilize p53, induce apoptosis, and suppress cell proliferation. Overexpression of Otub1K0 inhibits DNA-damage induced apoptosis. Adding either Lys-59 or Lys-109 back to the Otub1K0 mutant restores the monoubiquitination of Otub1 and its function to stabilize and activate p53. We further show that UbcH5 preferentially binds to the monoubiquitinated Otub1 via Ub interaction with its backside donor Ub-interacting surface, suggesting that this binding interferes with the self-assembly of Ub-charged UbcH5 (UbcH5∼Ub) conjugates, which is critical for Ub transfer. Thus, our data reveal novel insights into the Otub1 inhibition of E2 wherein monoubiquitination promotes the interaction of Otub1 with UbcH5 and the function to suppress it.

https://openalex.org/W2031301610,"In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients airways mucus shows an increased viscoelasticity due to the concentration of high molecular weight components. Such mucus thickening eventually leads to bacterial overgrowth and prevents mucus clearance. The altered rheological behavior of mucus results in chronic lung infection and inflammation, which causes most of the cases of morbidity and mortality, although the cystic fibrosis complications affect other organs as well. Here, we present a quantitative study on the correlation between cystic fibrosis mucus viscoelasticity and patients clinical status. In particular, a new diagnostic parameter based on the correlation between CF sputum viscoelastic properties and the severity of the disease, expressed in terms of FEV1 and bacterial colonization, was developed. By using principal component analysis, we show that the types of colonization and FEV1 classes are significantly correlated to the elastic modulus, and that the latter can be used for CF severity classification with a high predictive efficiency (88%). The data presented here show that the elastic modulus of airways mucus, given the high predictive efficiency, could be used as a new clinical parameter in the prognostic evaluation of cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2056160510,"Recently, it was discovered that serglycin, a hematopoietic cell proteoglycan, is the major proteoglycan expressed and constitutively secreted by multiple myeloma (MM) cells. High levels of serglycin are present in the bone marrow aspirates of at least 30% of newly diagnosed MM patients. However, its contribution to the pathophysiology of MM is unknown. Here, we show that serglycin knockdown (by ∼85% compared with normal levels), using lentiviral shRNA, dramatically attenuated MM tumor growth in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. Tumors formed from cells deficient in serglycin exhibited diminished levels of hepatocyte growth factor expression and impaired development of blood vessels, indicating that serglycin may affect tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, knockdown of serglycin significantly decreased MM cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells and collagen I. Even though serglycin proteoglycan does not have a transmembrane domain, flow cytometry showed that serglycin is present on the MM cell surface, and attachment to the cell surface is, at least in part, dependent on its chondroitin sulfate side chains. Co-precipitation of serglycin from conditioned medium of MM cells using a CD44-Fc chimera suggests that CD44 is the cell surface-binding partner for serglycin, which therefore may serve as a major ligand for CD44 at various stages during myeloma progression. Finally, we demonstrate that serglycin mRNA expression in MM cells is up-regulated by activin, a predominant cytokine among those increased in MM patients with osteolytic lesions. These studies provide direct evidence for a critical role for serglycin in MM pathogenesis and show that targeting serglycin may provide a novel therapeutic approach for MM."
https://openalex.org/W1977718987,"Objective Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) transdifferentiation and subsequent inflammation are important pathological processes involved in the formation of cirrhotic portal hypertension. This study characterizes the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to cholestatic liver fibrosis and portal hypertension, and focuses on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as a potential modulator in the early phase of cirrhotic portal hypertension. Methods Early cirrhotic portal hypertension was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) for three weeks. One week after operation, sham-operated (SHAM) and BDL rats received rapamycin (2 mg/kg/day) by intraperitoneal injection for fourteen days. Vehicle-treated SHAM and BDL rats served as controls. Fibrosis, inflammation, and portal pressure were evaluated by histology, morphometry, and hemodynamics. Expressions of pro-fibrogenic and pro-inflammatory genes in liver were measured by RT-PCR; alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and antigen Ki67 were detected by immunohistochemistry; expressions of AKT/mTOR signaling molecules, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p-ERK1/2, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) were assessed by western blot. Results The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was markedly activated in the early phase of cirrhotic portal hypertension induced by BDL in rats. mTOR blockade by rapamycin profoundly improved liver function by limiting inflammation, fibrosis and portal pressure. Rapamycin significantly inhibited the expressions of phosphorylated 70KD ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-P70S6K) and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-S6) but not p-AKT Ser473 relative to their total proteins in BDL-Ra rats. Those results suggested that mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) rather than mTORC2 was inhibited by rapamycin. Interestingly, we also found that the level of p-ERK1/2 to ERK1/2 was significantly increased in BDL rats, which was little affected by rapamycin. Conclusions The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway played an important role in the early phase of cirrhotic portal hypertension in rats, which could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the early phase of such pathophysiological progress."
https://openalex.org/W2026208199,"Angiopoietin (Ang) -1 and -2 and their receptor Tie2 play critical roles in regulating angiogenic processes during development, homeostasis, tumorigenesis, inflammation and tissue repair. Tie2 signaling is best characterized in endothelial cells, but a subset of human and murine circulating monocytes/macrophages essential to solid tumor formation express Tie2 and display immunosuppressive properties consistent with M2 macrophage polarization. However, we have recently shown that Tie2 is strongly activated in pro-inflammatory macrophages present in rheumatoid arthritis patient synovial tissue. Here we examined the relationship between Tie2 expression and function during human macrophage polarization. Tie2 expression was observed under all polarization conditions, but was highest in IFN-γ and IL-10 -differentiated macrophages. While TNF enhanced expression of a common restricted set of genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation in GM-CSF, IFN-γ and IL-10 -differentiated macrophages, expression of multiple chemokines and cytokines, including CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL8, IL6, and IL12B was further augmented in the presence of Ang-1 and Ang-2, via Tie2 activation of JAK/STAT signaling. Conditioned medium from macrophages stimulated with Ang-1 or Ang-2 in combination with TNF, sustained monocyte recruitment. Our findings suggest a general role for Tie2 in cooperatively promoting the inflammatory activation of macrophages, independently of polarization conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2004904875,"Subjective visual assessment of cervical cytology is flawed, and this can manifest itself by inter- and intra-observer variability resulting ultimately in the degree of discordance in the grading categorisation of samples in screening vs. representative histology. Biospectroscopy methods have been suggested as sensor-based tools that can deliver objective assessments of cytology. However, studies to date have been apparently flawed by a corresponding lack of diagnostic efficiency when samples have previously been classed using cytology screening. This raises the question as to whether categorisation of cervical cytology based on imperfect conventional screening reduces the diagnostic accuracy of biospectroscopy approaches; are these latter methods more accurate and diagnose underlying disease? The purpose of this study was to compare the objective accuracy of infrared (IR) spectroscopy of cervical cytology samples using conventional cytology vs. histology-based categorisation.Within a typical clinical setting, a total of n = 322 liquid-based cytology samples were collected immediately before biopsy. Of these, it was possible to acquire subsequent histology for n = 154. Cytology samples were categorised according to conventional screening methods and subsequently interrogated employing attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform IR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. IR spectra were pre-processed and analysed using linear discriminant analysis. Dunn's test was applied to identify the differences in spectra. Within the diagnostic categories, histology allowed us to determine the comparative efficiency of conventional screening vs. biospectroscopy to correctly identify either true atypia or underlying disease.Conventional cytology-based screening results in poor sensitivity and specificity. IR spectra derived from cervical cytology do not appear to discriminate in a diagnostic fashion when categories were based on conventional screening. Scores plots of IR spectra exhibit marked crossover of spectral points between different cytological categories. Although, significant differences between spectral bands in different categories are noted, crossover samples point to the potential for poor specificity and hampers the development of biospectroscopy as a diagnostic tool. However, when histology-based categories are used to conduct analyses, the scores plot of IR spectra exhibit markedly better segregation.Histology demonstrates that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of liquid-based cytology identifies the presence of underlying atypia or disease missed in conventional cytology screening. This study points to an urgent need for a future biospectroscopy study where categories are based on such histology. It will allow for the validation of this approach as a screening tool."
https://openalex.org/W2009566609,"Key circulating molecules that link vitamin D (VD) to pediatric obesity and its co-morbidities remain unclear. Using a proteomic approach, our objective was to identify key molecules in obese children dichotomized according to 25OH-vitamin D (25OHD) levels. A total of 42 obese children (M/F = 18/24) were divided according to their 25OHD3 levels into 25OHD3 deficient (VDD; n = 18; 25OHD<15 ng/ml) or normal subjects (NVD; n = 24; >30 ng/ml). Plasma proteomic analyses by two dimensional (2D)-electrophoresis were performed at baseline in all subjects. VDD subjects underwent a 12mo treatment with 3000 IU vitamin D3 once a week to confirm the proteomic analyses. The proteomic analyses identified 53 ""spots"" that differed between VDD and NVD (p<0.05), amongst which adiponectin was identified. Adiponectin was selected for confirmational studies due to its tight association with obesity and diabetes mellitus. Western Immunoblot (WIB) analyses of 2D-gels demonstrated a downregulation of adiponectin in VDD subjects, which was confirmed in the plasma from VDD with respect to NVD subjects (p<0.035) and increased following 12mo vitamin D3 supplementation in VDD subjects (p<0.02). High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, a surrogate indicator of insulin sensitivity, was significantly lower in VDD subjects (p<0.02) and improved with vitamin D3 supplementation (p<0.042). A direct effect in vitro of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 on adipocyte adiponectin synthesis was demonstrated, with adiponectin and its multimeric forms upregulated, even at low pharmacological doses (10(-9) M) of 1α,25-(OH)2D3. This upregulation was paralleled by the adiponectin interactive protein, DsbA-L, suggesting that the VD regulation of adiponectin involves post-transciptional events. Using a proteomic approach, multimeric adiponectin has been identified as a key plasma protein that links VDD to pediatric obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1986204569,"Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) is an inflammation-associated hyaluronan (HA)-binding protein that contributes to remodeling of HA-rich extracellular matrices during inflammatory processes and ovulation. The HA-binding domain of TSG-6 consists solely of a Link module, making it a prototypical member of the superfamily of proteins that interacts with this high molecular weight polysaccharide composed of repeating disaccharides of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Previously we modeled a complex of the TSG-6 Link module in association with an HA octasaccharide based on the structure of the domain in its HA-bound conformation. Here we have generated a refined model for a HA/Link module complex using novel restraints identified from NMR spectroscopy of the protein in the presence of 10 distinct HA oligosaccharides (from 4- to 8-mers); the model was then tested using unique sugar reagents, i.e. chondroitin/HA hybrid oligomers and an octasaccharide in which a single sugar ring was (13)C-labeled. The HA chain was found to make more extensive contacts with the TSG-6 surface than thought previously, such that a D-glucuronic acid ring makes stacking and ionic interactions with a histidine and lysine, respectively. Importantly, this causes the HA to bend around two faces of the Link module (resembling the way that HA binds to CD44), potentially providing a mechanism for how TSG-6 can reorganize HA during inflammation. However, the HA-binding site defined here may not play a role in TSG-6-mediated transfer of heavy chains from inter-α-inhibitor onto HA, a process known to be essential for ovulation."
https://openalex.org/W2143836666,"TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer subtype that does not express hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors, ER and PR) or amplified human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), and there currently exist no targeted therapies effective against it. Consequently, finding new molecular targets in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is critical to improving patient outcomes. Previously, we have detected the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 (gene: GRM1; protein: mGluR1) in TNBC and observed that targeting glutamatergic signaling inhibits TNBC growth both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we explored how mGluR1 contributes to TNBC progression, using the isogenic MCF10 progression series, which models breast carcinogenesis from nontransformed epithelium to malignant basal-like breast cancer. We observed that mGluR1 is expressed in human breast cancer and that in MCF10A cells, which model nontransformed mammary epithelium, but not in MCF10AT1 cells, which model atypical ductal hyperplasia, mGluR1 overexpression results in increased proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasiveness. In contrast, mGluR1 knockdown results in a decrease in these activities in malignant MCF10CA1d cells. Similarly, pharmacologic inhibition of glutamatergic signaling in MCF10CA1d cells results in a decrease in proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Finally, transduction of MCF10AT1 cells, which express c-Ha-ras, using a lentiviral construct expressing GRM1 results in transformation to carcinoma in 90% of resultant xenografts. We conclude that mGluR1 cooperates with other factors in hyperplastic mammary epithelium to contribute to TNBC progression and therefore propose that glutamatergic signaling represents a promising new molecular target for TNBC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2056781427,"Biological and signaling events that connect developmentally induced hyperbilirubinemia to bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) and CNS toxicity in humans are poorly understood. In mammals, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is the sole enzyme responsible for bilirubin glucuronidation, a rate-limiting step necessary for bilirubin metabolism and clearance. Humanized mice that express the entire UGT1 locus (hUGT1) and the UGT1A1 gene, develop neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, with 8-10% of hUGT1 mice succumbing to CNS damage, a phenotype that is presented by uncontrollable seizures. We demonstrate that neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis are prominent features of bilirubin brain toxicity, and a disturbed redox status resulting from activation of NADPH oxidase is an important contributing mechanism found in BIND. Using knock-out mice and primary brain cells, we connect a key pattern recognition receptor, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), to hyperbilirubinemia-induced signaling. We illustrate a requirement for TLR2 signaling in regulating gliosis, proinflammatory mediators, and oxidative stress when neonatal mice encounter severe hyperbilirubinemia. TLR2-mediated gliosis strongly correlates with pronounced neuroinflammation in the CNS with up-regulation of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, creating a pro-inflammatory CNS environment. Gene expression and immunohistochemistry staining show that hUGT1/Tlr2(-/-) mice fail to activate glial cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and stress response genes. In addition, bilirubin-induced apoptosis was significantly enhanced by blocking TLR2 signaling indicating its anti-apoptotic property. Consequently, a higher neonatal death rate (57.1%) in hUGT1/Tlr2(-/-) mice was observed when compared with hUGT1 mice (8.7%). These results suggest that TLR2 signaling and microglia neuroinflammation are linked to a repair and/or protection mode against BIND."
https://openalex.org/W2050913224,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a key agent for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Increased MTX plasma concentrations are associated with a higher risk of adverse drug effects. ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2) is important for excretion of MTX and its toxic metabolite. The ABCC2 −24C>T polymorphism (rs717620) reportedly contributes to variability of MTX kinetics. In the present study, we assessed the association between the ABCC2 −24C>T polymorphism and methotrexate (MTX) toxicities in childhood ALL patients treated with high-dose MTX. A total of 112 Han Chinese ALL patients were treated with high-dose MTX according to the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster 2000 protocol. Our results showed that presence of the −24T allele in ABCC2 gene led to significantly higher MTX plasma concentrations at 48 hours after the start of infusion, which would strengthen over repeated MTX infusion. The −24T allele in ABCC2 gene was significantly associated with higher risks of high-grade hematologic (leucopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) and non-hematologic (gastrointestinal and mucosal damage/oral mucositis) MTX toxicities. This study provides the first evidence that the −24T allele in ABCC2 gene is associated with the severity of MTX toxicities, which add fresh insights into clinical application of high-dose MTX and individualization of MTX treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2065644986,"We previously reported an altered hyaluronan (HA) metabolism in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) lung tissue and cultured smooth muscle cells. Hyaluronan was present in the smooth muscle cell layer surrounding the pulmonary vasculature and in plexigenic lesions. Additionally, cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells produced spontaneous HA ""cable"" structures, without additional stimuli, that were leukocyte-adhesive. We now present evidence that the HA that accumulates in IPAH plexigenic lesions is a pathological form of HA in which heavy chains (HCs) from the serum-derived proteoglycan inter-α-inhibitor are covalently attached to the HA backbone to form a pathological HC-HA complex. CD45-positive leukocytes were identified within these HC-HA matrices. Elevated mRNA levels of the enzyme that transfers HCs to HA, known as tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6, were detected in IPAH lung tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2060672431,"P73, a member of the p53 family, plays a critical role in neural development and tumorigenesis. Due to the usage of two different promoters, p73 is expressed as two major isoforms, TAp73 and ΔNp73, often with opposing functions. Here, we reported that transcriptional factor DEC1, a target of the p53 family, exerts a distinct control of TAp73 and ΔNp73 expression. In particular, we showed that DEC1 was able to increase TAp73 expression via transcriptional activation of the TAp73 promoter. By contrast, Np73 transcription was inhibited by DEC1 via transcriptional repression of the ΔNp73 promoter. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we showed that DEC1 was unable to increase TAp73 expression in the absence of HDAC8, suggesting that HDAC8 is required for DEC1 to enhance TAp73 expression. Furthermore, we found that DEC1 was able to interact with HDAC8 and recruit HDAC8 to the TAp73, but not the ΔNp73, promoter. Together, our data provide evidence that DEC1 and HDAC8 in differentially regulate TAp73 and ΔNp73 expression, suggesting that this regulation may lay a foundation for a therapeutic strategy to enhance the chemosensitivity of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000437853,"Our aim was to test whether pharmacological inhibition of cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) reverses non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats via suppression of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway expression. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed to two groups and were fed with a high fat and sucrose (HF-HS) diet or a normal chow diet, respectively. After four weeks, rats fed with a HF-HS diet were made diabetic with low-dose streptozotocin. At the 9th week the diabetic rats fed with a HF-HS diet or the non-diabetic rats fed with a normal chow diet were further divided into two subgroups treated with vehicle or celecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor, 10 mg/Kg/day, gavage) for the last 4 weeks, respectively. At the end of the 12th week, rats were anesthetized. NASH was assessed by histology. Related cytokine expression was measured at both the protein and gene levels through immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot and real-time PCR. T2DM rats fed with a HF-HS diet developed steatohepatitis and insulin resistance associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), insulin levels and the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS). The expression of Wnt5a, JNK1, NF-κB p65, and COX-2 were all significantly increased in the T2DM-NASH group compared with the control and control-cele group. Hepatic injury was improved by celecoxib in T2DM-NASH-Cele group indicated by reduced serum ALT and AST levels and hepatic inflammation was reduced by celecoxib showed by histology and the NAFLD activity score (NAS). Serum related metabolic parameters, HOMA-IR and insulin sensitivity index were all improved by celecoxib. The expression of Wnt5a, JNK1, NF-κB p65, and COX-2 expression were all suppressed by celecoxib in T2DM-NASH-Cele group. The results of the present study indicated that celecoxib ameliorated NASH in T2DM rats via suppression of the non-canonical Wnt5a/JNK1 signaling pathway expression."
https://openalex.org/W2047649641,"The actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNa) regulates neuronal migration during development, yet its roles in the mature brain remain largely obscure. Here, we probed the effects of FLNa on the regulation of ion channels that influence neuronal properties. We focused on the HCN1 channels that conduct Ih, a hyperpolarization-activated current crucial for shaping intrinsic neuronal properties. Whereas regulation of HCN1 channels by FLNa has been observed in melanoma cell lines, its physiological relevance to neuronal function and the underlying cellular pathways that govern this regulation remain unknown. Using a combination of mutational, pharmacological, and imaging approaches, we find here that FLNa facilitates a selective and reversible dynamin-dependent internalization of HCN1 channels in HEK293 cells. This internalization is accompanied by a redistribution of HCN1 channels on the cell surface, by accumulation of the channels in endosomal compartments, and by reduced Ih density. In hippocampal neurons, expression of a truncated dominant-negative FLNa enhances the expression of native HCN1. Furthermore, acute abrogation of HCN1-FLNa interaction in neurons, with the use of decoy peptides that mimic the FLNa-binding domain of HCN1, abolishes the punctate distribution of HCN1 channels in neuronal cell bodies, augments endogenous Ih, and enhances the rebound-response (""voltage-sag"") of the neuronal membrane to transient hyperpolarizing events. Together, these results support a major function of FLNa in modulating ion channel abundance and membrane trafficking in neurons, thereby shaping their biophysical properties and function."

Following global cerebral ischemia, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons are more vulnerable to injury than their cortical counterparts. The mechanisms that underlie this difference are unclear. Cultured hippocampal neurons respond to OGD with a rapid internalization of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA2, resulting in a switch from GluA2-containing Ca2+-impermeable receptors to GluA2-lacking Ca2+-permeable subtypes (CP-AMPARs). GluA2 internalization is a critical component of OGD-induced cell death in hippocampal neurons. It is unknown how AMPAR trafficking is affected in cortical neurons following OGD. Here, we show that cultured cortical neurons are resistant to an OGD insult that causes cell death in hippocampal neurons. GluA1 is inserted at the plasma membrane in both cortical and hippocampal neurons in response to OGD. In contrast, OGD causes a rapid endocytosis of GluA2 in hippocampal neurons, which is absent in cortical neurons. These data demonstrate that populations of neurons with different vulnerabilities to OGD recruit distinct cell biological mechanisms in response to insult, and that a crucial aspect of the mechanism leading to OGD-induced cell death is absent in cortical neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2055702386,"This paper reports rational engineering of Trypanosoma rangeli sialidase to develop an effective enzyme for a potentially important type of reactivity: production of sialylated prebiotic glycans. The Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase and the homologous T. rangeli sialidase has previously been used to investigate the structural requirements for trans-sialidase activity. We observed that the T. cruzi trans-sialidase has a seven-amino-acid motif (197-203) at the border of the substrate binding cleft. The motif differs substantially in chemical properties and substitution probability from the homologous sialidase, and we hypothesised that this motif is important for trans-sialidase activity. The 197-203 motif is strongly positively charged with a marked change in hydrogen bond donor capacity as compared to the sialidase. To investigate the role of this motif, we expressed and characterised a T. rangeli sialidase mutant, Tr13. Conditions for efficient trans-sialylation were determined, and Tr13's acceptor specificity demonstrated promiscuity with respect to the acceptor molecule enabling sialylation of glycans containing terminal galactose and glucose and even monomers of glucose and fucose. Sialic acid is important in association with human milk oligosaccharides, and Tr13 was shown to sialylate a number of established and potential prebiotics. Initial evaluation of prebiotic potential using pure cultures demonstrated, albeit not selectively, growth of Bifidobacteria. Since the 197-203 motif stands out in the native trans-sialidase, is markedly different from the wild-type sialidase compared to previous mutants, and is shown here to confer efficient and broad trans-sialidase activity, we suggest that this motif can serve as a framework for future optimization of trans-sialylation towards prebiotic production."

However, it is still unknown whether these two brain areas also play a role in defensive behavior induced by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG). In the present study, rats were implanted with electrodes into the dPAG to determine freezing and escape response thresholds after sham or bilateral electrolytic lesions of the DH or VH. The duration of freezing behavior that outlasted electrical stimulation of the dPAG was also measured. The next day, these animals were subjected to contextual fear conditioning using footshock as an unconditioned stimulus. Electrolytic lesions of the DH and VH impaired contextual fear conditioning. Only VH lesions disrupted conditioned freezing immediately after footshock and increased the thresholds of aversive freezing and escape responses to dPAG electrical stimulation. Neither DH nor VH lesions disrupted post-dPAG stimulation freezing. These results indicate that the VH but not DH plays an important role in aversively defensive behavior induced by dPAG electrical stimulation. Interpretations of these findings should be made with caution because of the fact that a non-fiber-sparing lesion method was employed."
https://openalex.org/W1975317476,"The transcription factor SOX2, associated with amongst others OCT3/4, is essential for maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. SOX2 is highly expressed in embryonal carcinoma (EC), the stem cell component of malignant nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, referred to as germ cell cancer (GCC). In fact, OCT3/4 together with SOX2 is an informative diagnostic tool for EC in a clinical setting. Several studies support the hypothesis that SOX2 is a relevant oncogenic factor in various cancers and recently, SOX2 has been suggested as a putative therapeutic target for early stage EC. We demonstrate the presence of genomic amplification of SOX2 in an EC cell line, NCCIT, using array comparative genome hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Down-regulation of SOX2 by targeted siRNA provokes NCCIT cells towards apoptosis, while inhibition of OCT3/4 expression induced differentiation, with retained SOX2 levels. Mice pluripotent xenografts from NCCIT (N-NCCIT and N2-NCCIT) show a consistent SOX2 expression, in spite of loss of the expression of OCT3/4, and differentiation, with retained presence of genomic amplification. No SOX2 amplification has been identified in primary pure and mixed EC in vivo patient samples so far. The data presented in this study are based on a single EC cell line with a SOX2 amplification, with NT2 as control EC cell line, showing no profound induction of apoptosis upon SOX2 downregulation. The findings are of relevance to identify mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of EC tumors, and support the model of SOX2-oncogene dependency of EC, which however, does not exclude induction of differentiation. This finding is likely related to the presence of wild type p53 in GCC, resulting in expression of downstream target genes, amongst others miR-34a, miR-145 and SOX2, associated to the unique sensitivity of GCC to DNA damaging agents."

However, there is limited understanding of the role of STAT3 in modulating other aspects of tumorigenesis such as angiogenesis. In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide on tumor angiogenesis. Experimental Design A STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used to inhibit STAT3 in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. The biochemical effects of STAT3 inhibition were examined in conjunction with the consequences on proliferation, migration, apoptotic staining, and tubule formation. Additionally, we assessed the effects of STAT3 inhibition on tumor angiogenesis using murine xenograft models. Results STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide decreased proliferation, induces apoptosis, decreased migration, and decreased tubule formation of endothelial cells in vitro. The STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide also inhibited tumor angiogenesis in murine tumor xenografts. Lastly, our data suggest that the antiangiogenic effects of STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide were mediatedthrough the inhibition of both STAT3 and STAT1. Conclusions The STAT3 decoy oligonucleotidewas found to be an effective antiangiogenic agent, which is likely to contribute to the overall antitumor effects of this agent in solid tumors.Taken together with the previously demonstrated antitumor activity of this agent, STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide represents a promising single agent approach to targeting both the tumor and vascular compartments in various malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2006299598,"The allosteric communication between the ATP- and DNA-binding sites of RecQ helicases enables efficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis to translocation along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and, in turn, the restructuring of multistranded DNA substrates during genome maintenance processes. In this study, we used the tryptophan fluorescence signal of Escherichia coli RecQ helicase to decipher the kinetic mechanism of the interaction of the enzyme with ssDNA. Rapid kinetic experiments revealed that ssDNA binding occurs in a two-step mechanism in which the initial binding step is followed by a structural transition of the DNA-bound helicase. We found that the nucleotide state of RecQ greatly influences the kinetics of the detected structural transition, which leads to a high affinity DNA-clamped state in the presence of the nucleotide analog ADP-AlF4. The DNA binding mechanism is largely independent of ssDNA length, indicating the independent binding of RecQ molecules to ssDNA and the lack of significant DNA end effects. The structural transition of DNA-bound RecQ was not detected when the ssDNA binding capability of the helicase-RNase D C-terminal domain was abolished or the domain was deleted. The results shed light on the nature of conformational changes leading to processive ssDNA translocation and multistranded DNA processing by RecQ helicases. The allosteric communication between the ATP- and DNA-binding sites of RecQ helicases enables efficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis to translocation along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and, in turn, the restructuring of multistranded DNA substrates during genome maintenance processes. In this study, we used the tryptophan fluorescence signal of Escherichia coli RecQ helicase to decipher the kinetic mechanism of the interaction of the enzyme with ssDNA. Rapid kinetic experiments revealed that ssDNA binding occurs in a two-step mechanism in which the initial binding step is followed by a structural transition of the DNA-bound helicase.

The translocation of RecQ helicases along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is the basis for the various DNA-restructuring activities of these enzymes, is fueled by ATP hydrolysis catalyzed within their ATPase active site.

However, little is known about this communication in RecQ helicases (15.Gyimesi M. Sarlós K. Kovács M.

DNA-induced conformational changes were identified in various SF1, -2, and -6 helicases. DNA binding by E. coli UvrD (SF1) helicase is associated with a large rotation of the auxiliary DNA binding domain 2B relative to the rest of the protein (16.Lee J.Y. Yang W.

RecQ helicases have a motor core comprising two tandem RecA-like domains, together forming the ATPase pocket. The Zn2+-binding domain (ZBD) and the winged helix domain (WHD) together constitute the RecQ C-terminal region. The helicase-RNase D C-terminal (HRDC) domain is connected to the other domains via a flexible linker. Proposed DNA-interacting elements of E. coli RecQ helicase were identified by Bernstein et al. (29.Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. High-resolution structure of the E. coli RecQ helicase catalytic core.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), who crystallized a RecQ fragment comprising the RecA, ZBD, and WHD domains. An aromatic-rich region within the RecQ core (between conserved helicase motifs II and III) has been implicated in coupling nucleic acid binding, unwinding and ATP hydrolysis (30.Zittel M.C.

Role of a highly conserved aromatic-rich sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6982-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Via its interaction with the γ-phosphate of the bound ATP molecule, the so-called arginine finger (in helicase motif VI) was shown to be essential in coupling ATP hydrolysis and DNA binding to the unwinding activity of human BLM (31.Ren H. Dou S.X. Rigolet P. Yang Y. Wang P.Y. Amor-Gueret M. Xi X.G. The arginine finger of the Bloom syndrome protein.

Alignment of the crystal structure of human RECQ1 with those of DNA-bound complexes of other helicases provided no indications for significant DNA-induced conformational changes (32.Pike A.C.

Besides its general role in protein structure stabilization, the ZBD has been implicated to contribute to DNA binding by RecQ helicases (34.Liu J.L. Rigolet P. Dou S.X. Wang P.Y. Xi X.G.

Due to its flexible linkage to the helicase motor core, the HRDC domain could not be crystallized with the other RecQ domains. Thus, its structure has been determined in isolation from other parts of the molecule (35.Kitano K. Kim S.Y. Hakoshima T.

Molecular dynamics studies suggested that the interdomain flexibility within E. coli RecQ leads to changes in the interactions at domain interfaces upon DNA binding (40.Pandey N. Govardhan S. Pathak R.K. Mobility in the structure of E. coli recQ helicase upon substrate binding as seen from molecular dynamics simulations.Bioinformation. 2011; 7: 371-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Biochemical data on the coupling between nucleotide and DNA binding to RecQ helicases are scarce. A study of the DNA binding properties of E. coli RecQ DNA binding revealed only a weak effect of AMPPNP on the ssDNA affinity of the enzyme (45.Dou S.X. Wang P.Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G.

Kinetic data on the DNA interaction or the coupling of nucleotide and DNA interactions of RecQ helicases are missing, except for the implication that in human BLM, ATP binding was largely unaffected by the presence of ssDNA (15.Gyimesi M.

Studies utilizing fluorescence signals of protein Trp residues as well as those of fluorescently labeled DNA substrates revealed a two-step DNA binding process for Rep helicase, leading to dimerization of the enzyme (50.Bjornson K.P.

E. coli RecQ harbors four Trp residues located in the N-core RecA (Trp138 and Trp154), ZBD (Trp347), and WHD (Trp469) domains. In this study, we used Trp fluorescence signals in spectroscopic and rapid kinetic experiments to determine the kinetic mechanism of the interaction of the enzyme with ssDNA substrates. Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed at 25 °C in SF50 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2). Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ATP was from Roche Applied Science, and [γ-32P]ATP was from Institute of Isotopes Co. Ltd. (Budapest, Hungary). The RecQ-ADP-AlF4 complex was made by complementing a premixture of 3 μm RecQ and 1 mm ADP with 1 mm AlCl3 and 5 mm NaF, followed by incubation on ice for 3 h. In stopped-flow experiments using nucleotide-free RecQ, all reagents were preincubated with 0.02 unit/ml apyrase for 30 min at 25 °C to remove ATP contamination. Oligonucleotides and poly(dT) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Heparin (Sigma H3393) and dextran sulfate (DxSO4) (Sigma D8906) were dissolved in sterile distilled water at 50 mg/ml and dialyzed against sterile distilled water and then SF50 buffer in molecular weight cut-off 3500 dialysis tubing (Serva 44183). DNA concentrations are expressed in terms of constituent nucleotide units (nt) throughout. The coding regions of truncated RecQ constructs RecQ523 and RecQ414 were amplified by PCR using GoTaq polymerase, using the wild-type RecQ DNA construct as template (12.Sarlós K. Gyimesi M. Kovács M. RecQ helicase translocates along single-stranded DNA with a moderate processivity and tight mechanochemical coupling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 9804-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PCR products were digested and ligated into pTXB3 vector (New England Biolabs) between NotI and SapI (Fermentas) restriction sites. The RecQY555A DNA construct was prepared using QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. DNA constructs were transformed into E. coli BER2566 (NEB) cells. Induction, protein expression, and purification were performed as described previously for wild-type RecQ (12.Sarlós K. Gyimesi M. Kovács M. RecQ helicase translocates along single-stranded DNA with a moderate processivity and tight mechanochemical coupling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 9804-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other protein constructs (RecQY555A, RecQ523, and RecQ414) were further purified on a MonoQ anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) (0–1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 ml/min for 50 min) instead of the heparin column. Trp fluorescence was excited at 297 nm (with 1-nm bandwidth), and emission was detected at 310–420 nm (with 4-nm bandwidth) in a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer in SF50 buffer plus 10% glycerol. Spectra were corrected for the inner filter effect of DNA based on control experiments performed using N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide instead of RecQ (applied at a concentration identical to that of RecQ tryptophans). Stopped-flow experiments were performed in KinTek SF-2004 and BioLogic SFM 300 apparatuses. Trp fluorescence was excited at 297 nm (4-nm bandwidth), and emission was detected through a 340-nm interference filter (Comar). In order to obtain a sufficient number of data points throughout different time scales and ascertain their unbiased contribution to the fitted parameters, split linear or quasilogarithmic time base sampling was applied. Accordingly, the higher noise levels at shorter times resulted from the shorter signal integration times used in this regime. ATPase activities were measured using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-linked (PK-LDH) assay (14 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 200 μm NADH in the presence of 50 μg/ml BSA in SF50 buffer). Time courses of NADH absorbance (ϵ340 nm = 6220 m−1 cm−1) were followed at 340 nm in a Shimadzu UV-2101PC photometer. Data analysis and fitting was performed using OriginLab version 8.0 (Microcal Corp.). Means ± S.E. are reported throughout. The DNA concentration dependence of measured parameters was fitted by hyperbolic or quadratic binding equations (Equations 1 and 2, respectively).y=y0+(ysat−y0)CDNAKd+cDNA(Eq. 1) y=y0+(ysat−y0)xcE+ncDNA+Kd−(cE+ncDNA+Kd)2−4cEncDNA2cE(Eq. 2) where y represents the measured value at a given DNA concentration; y0 and ysat are the values of the given parameter at zero and saturating DNA concentration, respectively; cE and cDNA are concentrations of RecQ and DNA (in nt), respectively; n is the inverse of the binding stoichiometry (mol of RecQ/mol of DNA in nt); and Kd is the (apparent) dissociation constant. The quadratic equation was used in cases where the tight interaction between RecQ and DNA allowed the separate determination of DNA binding stoichiometries (1/n) and Kd values. To mimic the nucleotide states adopted by RecQ helicase during the ATPase cycle, we used a series of nucleotides and nucleotide analogs, including ATP, ADP, AMPPNP (a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog), and ADP-AlF4 (a nucleotide analog thought to mimic an intermediate during the hydrolytic process). The addition of different nucleotides to RecQ caused different extents of quench (5–17%) and a 2–3-nm red shift in the emission spectrum of the protein (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The addition of dT54 ssDNA to nucleotide-free RecQ caused a large (62%) quench and a 4-nm blue shift (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Similar large extents of DNA-induced quench were seen also in the presence of nucleotides (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The DNA-induced blue shift was even larger in RecQ-nucleotide complexes than in nucleotide-free RecQ (by about 2 nm), indicating the formation of ternary complexes between the enzyme and the nucleotide and DNA ligands. Increasing the nucleotide and DNA concentrations specified in Fig. 1A did not cause further changes in Trp spectra, indicating that quasisaturating conditions were reached.TABLE 1DNA binding properties of RecQ in different nucleotide statesParameterSource dataNucleotide-freeAMPPNPADPADP-AlF4Total DNA-induced quench (%)aRelative to the Trp fluorescence level of the corresponding DNA-free RecQ-nucleotide complex.Trp spectrabValues in parentheses indicate the extent of nucleotide-induced quench in the absence of DNA.65 ± 469 ± 4 (5 ± 1)62 ± 4 (11 ± 1)70 ± 3 (17 ± 2)Amplitudes59 ± 161 ± 151 ± 262 ± 2Contribution of slow phase (% of total quench)Amplitudes49 ± 756 ± 314 ± 1053 ± 2DNA-binding stoichiometry (nt/RecQ)Amplitudes20 ± 314 ± 814 ± 340 ± 18k1 (μm−1 s−1)Binding kinetics7.8 ± 1.75.0 ± 0.69.1 ± 0.60.76 ± 0.07k–1 (s−1)Binding kinetics140 ± 11088 ± 19140 ± 2010 ± 7K1 (μm)k−1/k118 ± 1818 ± 615 ± 313 ± 10k2 + k−2 (s−1)Binding kinetics8.5 ± 3.03.2 ± 0.418 ± 52.0 ± 0.3k−2 (s−1)Binding kinetics2.2 ± 3.30.30 ± 0.506.7 ± 2.7< 0.1DxSO4 chasingcDetermined at [DxSO4] = 0.1 mg/ml.4.1 ± 0.30.40 ± 0.0312 ± 1< 0.01Heparin chasingdValues extrapolated to zero heparin concentration (cf.

We estimate HIV over 18 years in a rural population in Uganda, examine method-specific differences in estimated , and estimate behavioural changes that would reduce below one. Methods Data on HIV natural history and infectiousness were collated from literature. Data on new sexual partner count were available from a rural clinical cohort in Uganda over 1991–2008. was estimated using six methods. Behavioural changes required to reduce below one were calculated. Results Reported number of new partners per year was 0 to 16 (women) and 0 to 80 (men). When proportionate sexual mixing was assumed, the different methods yielded comparable estimates. Assuming totally assortative mixing led to increased estimates in the high sexual activity class while all estimates in the low-activity class were below one. Using the “effective” partner change rate introduced by Anderson and colleagues resulted in estimates all above one except in the lowest sexual activity class. could be reduced below one if: (a) medium risk individuals reduce their partner acquisition rate by 70% and higher risk individuals reduce their partner acquisition rate by 93%, or (b) higher risk individuals reduce the partner acquisition rate by 95%. Conclusions The estimated depended strongly on the method used. Ignoring variation in sexual activity leads to an underestimation of . Relying on behaviour change alone to eradicate HIV may require unrealistically large reductions in risk behaviour, even though for a small proportion of the population. To control HIV, complementary prevention strategies such as male circumcision and HIV treatment services need rapid scale up."
https://openalex.org/W2014346074,"The enzyme phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa catalyzes an intramolecular phosphoryl transfer across its phosphosugar substrates, which are precursors in the synthesis of exoproducts involved in bacterial virulence. Previous structural studies of PMM/PGM have established a key role for conformational change in its multistep reaction, which requires a dramatic 180° reorientation of the intermediate within the active site. Here hydrogen-deuterium exchange by mass spectrometry and small angle x-ray scattering were used to probe the conformational flexibility of different forms of PMM/PGM in solution, including its active, phosphorylated state and the unphosphorylated state that occurs transiently during the catalytic cycle. In addition, the effects of ligand binding were assessed through use of a substrate analog. We found that both phosphorylation and binding of ligand produce significant effects on deuterium incorporation. Phosphorylation of the conserved catalytic serine has broad effects on residues in multiple domains and is supported by small angle x-ray scattering data showing that the unphosphorylated enzyme is less compact in solution. The effects of ligand binding are generally manifested near the active site cleft and at a domain interface that is a site of conformational change. These results suggest that dephosphorylation of the enzyme may play two critical functional roles: a direct role in the chemical step of phosphoryl transfer and secondly through propagation of structural flexibility. We propose a model whereby increased enzyme flexibility facilitates the reorientation of the reaction intermediate, coupling changes in structural dynamics with the unique catalytic mechanism of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2034087762,"Purpose Ventricular function is a powerful predictor of survival in patients with heart failure (HF). However, studies characterizing gated F-18 FDG PET for the assessment of the cardiac function are rare. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare gated F-18 FDG PET and cardiac MRI for the assessment of ventricular volume and ejection fraction (EF) in patients with HF. Methods Eighty-nine patients with diagnosed HF who underwent both gated F-18 FDG PET/CT and cardiac MRI within 3 days were included in the analysis. Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and EF were obtained from gated F-18 FDG PET/CT using the Quantitative Gated SPECT (QGS) and 4D-MSPECT software. Results LV EDV and LV ESV measured by QGS were significantly lower than those measured by cardiac MRI (both P<0.0001). In contrast, the corresponding values for LV EDV for 4D-MSPECT were comparable, and LV ESV was underestimated with borderline significance compared with cardiac MRI (P = 0.047). LV EF measured by QGS and cardiac MRI showed no significant differences, whereas the corresponding values for 4D-MSPECT were lower than for cardiac MRI (P<0.0001). The correlations of LV EDV, LV ESV, and LV EF between gated F-18 FDG PET/CT and cardiac MRI were excellent for both QGS (r = 0.92, 0.92, and 0.76, respectively) and 4D-MSPECT (r = 0.93, 0.94, and 0.75, respectively). However, Bland-Altman analysis revealed a significant systemic error, where LV EDV (−27.9±37.0 mL) and ESV (−18.6±33.8 mL) were underestimated by QGS. Conclusion Despite the observation that gated F-18 FDG PET/CT were well correlated with cardiac MRI for assessing LV function, variation was observed between the two imaging modalities, and so these imaging techniques should not be used interchangeably."
https://openalex.org/W2058891455,"mTORC1 plays critical roles in the regulation of protein synthesis, growth, and proliferation in response to nutrients, growth factors, and energy conditions. One of the substrates of mTORC1 is 4E-BP1, whose phosphorylation by mTORC1 reverses its inhibitory action on eIF4E, resulting in the promotion of protein synthesis. Raptor in mTOR complex 1 is believed to recruit 4E-BP1, facilitating phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by the kinase mTOR. We applied chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry analysis to gain insight into interactions between mTORC1 and 4E-BP1. Using the cross-linking reagent bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate, we showed that Raptor can be cross-linked with 4E-BP1. Mass spectrometric analysis of cross-linked Raptor-4E-BP1 led to the identification of several cross-linked peptide pairs. Compilation of these peptides revealed that the most N-terminal Raptor N-terminal conserved domain (in particular residues from 89 to 180) of Raptor is the major site of interaction with 4E-BP1. On 4E-BP1, we found that cross-links with Raptor were clustered in the central region (amino acid residues 56-72) we call RCR (Raptor cross-linking region). Intramolecular cross-links of Raptor suggest the presence of two structured regions of Raptor: one in the N-terminal region and the other in the C-terminal region. In support of the idea that the Raptor N-terminal conserved domain and the 4E-BP1 central region are closely located, we found that peptides that encompass the RCR of 4E-BP1 inhibit cross-linking and interaction of 4E-BP1 with Raptor. Furthermore, mutations of residues in the RCR decrease the ability of 4E-BP1 to serve as a substrate for mTORC1 in vitro and in vivo."

Declines in under-5 mortality in the four poorest wealth quantiles were compared to the decline among the wealthiest at varying levels of health aid per capita using fixed effects multivariable regression models and controlling for maternal education, urbanization, and domestic spending on health among recipient countries.Each additional dollar in total health aid per capita was associated with 5.7 fewer deaths per 10,000 child-years among children in the poorest relative to the wealthiest households (p<0.001). This was also true when measured in percent declines (1.90% faster decline in under-5 mortality among the poorest compared with the wealthiest with each dollar in total health aid, p = 0.008). The association was stronger when using health aid specifically for malaria than total health aid, 12.60% faster decline among the poorest compared with the wealthiest with each dollar in malaria aid, p = 0.001.Foreign aid to the health sector is preferentially related to reductions in under-5 mortality among the poorest compared with the wealthiest. Health aid addressing malaria, which imposes a disproportionate burden among the poor, may explain the observed effect."
https://openalex.org/W2032291788,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. One of the most important prognostic factors for survival is the early detection of the disease. Recent studies indicate that extracellular vesicles may provide diagnostic information for cancer management. We demonstrate the secretion of extracellular vesicles by primary breast epithelial cells enriched for stem/progenitor cells cultured as mammospheres, in non-adherent conditions. Using a proteomic approach we identified proteins contained in these vesicles whose expression is affected by hormonal changes in the cellular environment. In addition, we showed that these vesicles are capable of promoting changes in expression levels of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell markers. Our findings suggest that secreted extracellular vesicles could represent potential diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for breast cancer and support a role for extracellular vesicles in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2138366750,"Lung function measures are heritable, predict mortality and are relevant in diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD and asthma are diseases of the airways with major public health impacts and each have a heritable component. Genome-wide association studies of SNPs have revealed novel genetic associations with both diseases but only account for a small proportion of the heritability. Complex copy number variation may account for some of the missing heritability. A well-characterised genomic region of complex copy number variation contains beta-defensin genes (DEFB103, DEFB104 and DEFB4), which have a role in the innate immune response. Previous studies have implicated these and related genes as being associated with asthma or COPD. We hypothesised that copy number variation of these genes may play a role in lung function in the general population and in COPD and asthma risk. We undertook copy number typing of this locus in 1149 adult and 689 children using a paralogue ratio test and investigated association with COPD, asthma and lung function. Replication of findings was assessed in a larger independent sample of COPD cases and smoking controls. We found evidence for an association of beta-defensin copy number with COPD in the adult cohort (OR = 1.4, 95%CI:1.02-1.92, P = 0.039) but this finding, and findings from a previous study, were not replicated in a larger follow-up sample(OR = 0.89, 95%CI:0.72-1.07, P = 0.217). No robust evidence of association with asthma in children was observed. We found no evidence for association between beta-defensin copy number and lung function in the general populations. Our findings suggest that previous reports of association of beta-defensin copy number with COPD should be viewed with caution. Suboptimal measurement of copy number can lead to spurious associations. Further beta-defensin copy number measurement in larger sample sizes of COPD cases and children with asthma are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2021026714,"The insular cortex (IC) is a limbic structure involved in cardiovascular responses observed during aversive threats. However, the specific neurotransmitter mediating IC control of cardiovascular adjustments to stress is yet unknown. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the role of local IC adrenoceptors in the cardiovascular responses elicited by acute restraint stress in rats. Bilateral microinjection of different doses (0.3, 5, 10 and 15 nmol/100 nl) of the selective α1-adrenoceptor antagonist WB4101 into the IC reduced both the arterial pressure and heart rate increases elicited by restraint stress. However, local IC treatment with different doses (0.3, 5, 10 and 15 nmol/100 nl) of the selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonist RX821002 reduced restraint-evoked tachycardia without affecting the pressor response. The present findings are the first direct evidence showing the involvement of IC adrenoceptors in cardiovascular adjustments observed during aversive threats. Our findings indicate that IC noradrenergic neurotransmission acting through activation of both α1- and α2-adrenoceptors has a facilitatory influence on pressor response to acute restraint stress. Moreover, IC α1-adrenoceptors also play a facilitatory role on restraint-evoked tachycardiac response."
https://openalex.org/W2142973117,"Human cationic trypsinogen, precursor of the digestive enzyme trypsin, can be rapidly degraded to protect the pancreas when pathological conditions threaten, while trypsin itself is impressively resistant to degradation. For either form, degradation is controlled by two necessary initial proteolytic events: cleavage of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond by chymotrypsin C (CTRC) and cleavage of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond by trypsin. Here we demonstrate that the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond of human cationic trypsin, but not trypsinogen, is thermodynamically stable, such that cleavage by CTRC leads to an equilibrium mixture containing 10% cleaved and 90% uncleaved trypsin. When cleaved trypsin was incubated with CTRC, the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond was re-synthesized to establish the same equilibrium. The thermodynamic stability of the scissile peptide bond was not dependent on CTRC or Leu-81, as re-synthesis was also accomplished by other proteases acting on mutated cationic trypsin. The Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond is located within a calcium binding loop, and thermodynamic stability of the bond was strictly dependent on calcium and on the calcium-coordinated residue Glu-85. Trypsinolytic cleavage of the Arg122–Val123 site was also delayed in trypsin relative to trypsinogen in a calcium-dependent manner, but for this bond cleavage was modulated by kinetic rather than thermodynamic control. Our results reveal that the trypsinogen to trypsin conformational switch modulates cleavage susceptibility of nick sites by altering both the thermodynamics and kinetics of cleavage to protect human cationic trypsin from premature degradation.

Proteins are the versatile molecular workhorses of biology; they catalyze chemical reactions, perform complex mechanical tasks, and also comprise much of the structural scaffolding of living organisms. In the animal kingdom, essential amino acid building blocks for protein synthesis are derived from digestion of protein-rich foods, or through the salvage and degradation of cellular and secreted proteins that have passed their useful life span (1.Freeman H.J. Kim Y.S. Digestion and absorption of protein.Annu. Rev. Med. 1978; 29: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, the proteolytic enzymes evolved to break proteins down into their component amino acids are themselves proteins. How does such a protein, residing in a compartment filled with other digestive proteases, remain intact, and functionally active for long enough to carry out its function? Trypsin, an archetypal example of a digestive enzyme, must function in the digestive juice of the small intestine, comprised of a mixture of active digestive proteases at concentrations that may exceed one milligram per milliliter (2.Borgstrom B.

It retains its structure and activity for long enough to completely digest dietary protein in the duodenum, being only very slowly inactivated during its intestinal transit. In the terminal ileum trypsin retains about 10–20% of the activity measured in the duodenum; this gradual degradation is likely to serve the physiological purpose of mitigating loss of digestive enzyme protein through the stool (2.Borgstrom B.

Trypsin is produced in the pancreas as trypsinogen, an inactive precursor possessing a short N-terminal activation peptide. Trypsinogen is normally activated in the duodenum upon cleavage by enteropeptidase, but under pathological conditions can be susceptible to autoactivation in the pancreas, where in turn it will activate other digestive zymogens including CTRC (7.Sahin-Tóth M. Biochemical models of hereditary pancreatitis.Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 2006; 35: 303-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this event, degradation of remaining trypsinogen in the pancreas serves as an important protective mechanism to limit the scope of the damage. Trypsinogen degradation is initiated by CTRC and trypsin cleavage at the same two nick sites, but here will proceed much more rapidly to completion. In this study, we explored the basis for control of trypsin/trypsinogen proteolytic stability, and identified a novel mechanism by which the subtle trypsinogen to trypsin conformational switch modulates nick site cleavage susceptibility. Efficient digestion of a protein by a protease is generally understood to require (a) colocalization of protein and protease, (b) an amino acid sequence motif within the protein matching the specificity requirement of the protease, and (c) physical accessibility and sufficient flexibility of the cleavage site (8.Hubbard S.J. The structural aspects of limited proteolysis of native proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 9.Kazanov M.D. Igarashi Y. Eroshkin A.M.

Remarkably, we find that alterations in protein flexibility can modulate not only the accessibility of the nick site or the kinetics of proteolysis, but also the fundamental thermodynamic stability of the nick site peptide bond. Whereas in trypsinogen the cleavage of Leu81–Glu82 by CTRC proceeds rapidly to completion, in trypsin the enhanced thermodynamic stability of this same peptide bond results in a cleavage/re-ligation equilibrium in which the intact form predominates by a factor of 10. This mechanism, in which trypsin activity is temporarily prolonged in the presence of degrading enzymes by thermodynamic stability of a peptide bond, may be a widespread contributor to protein stability in vivo that has previously remained unrecognized.

To study re-synthesis of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond in S200A-trypsinogen, samples were pre-cleaved at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 25 nm CTRC for 15 min and re-synthesis was initiated by adding 1 mm CaCl2 and 100 nm CTRC. Samples (75 μl) were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration), the precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration), and heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Electrophoretic separation was performed on 15% SDS-PAGE mini gels in standard Tris-glycine buffer. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Quantitation of bands was carried out with the Quantity One 4.6.9 (Bio-Rad) software. Rectangles were drawn around each band of interest, and an identical rectangle was used in each lane for background subtraction. When cleavage and re-synthesis of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond was studied, the intensity of the uncleaved, intact trypsin band (24 kDa, migrating at ∼30 kDa) was expressed as percent of the total intensity of the cleaved and uncleaved trypsin bands. In this calculation only the larger, C-terminal cleavage fragment (18 kDa, migrating at ∼20 kDa), was considered and the small N-terminal fragment (6.5 kDa, migrating at ∼9 kDa) was ignored because its staining intensity was highly variable. This approach was validated by running samples under non-reducing conditions, when the cleaved trypsin formed a single band on gels migrating slower than intact, uncleaved trypsin. Results of the densitometric evaluation of the cleavage reactions were essentially identical when samples were analyzed under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Cleavage of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond in trypsinogen resulted in two fragments (12 and 13 kDa) that co-migrated on reducing gels as a single band at ∼15 kDa. Densitometry was performed by measuring the intensity of the uncleaved, intact trypsinogen band (25 kDa, migrating at ∼31 kDa) as percent of the total intensity of the cleaved and uncleaved bands. In trypsin, cleavage of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond generated two cleavage fragments (11 and 13 kDa, migrating at ∼13 and ∼15 kDa on reducing gels, respectively). The intensity of the uncleaved, intact trypsin band was determined by densitometry as percent of the total intensity of the intact band plus the two cleavage product bands. Human cationic trypsin structures were rendered with PYMOL 1.3 software using the coordinates of Protein Data Bank file 2RA3 (17.Salameh M.A. Soares A.S. Hockla A. Radisky E.S. Structural basis for accelerated cleavage of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) by human mesotrypsin.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4115-4123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mutated His-122 found in this structure was replaced with the native Arg in the model. Previously we discovered that degradation of human cationic trypsin is regulated by CTRC cleavage at the Leu81–Glu82 bond (Fig. 1A), which is necessary for subsequent autolytic breakdown (6.Szmola R. Sahin-Tóth M. Chymotrypsin C (caldecrin) promotes degradation of human cationic trypsin: identity with Rinderknecht's enzyme Y.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To selectively study the kinetics of this initial cleavage event without interference from autolysis, the catalytic serine residue in human cationic trypsin was mutated to alanine and constructs were made in this inactive S200A background. Incubation of cationic trypsin with a catalytic amount of CTRC in 1 mm calcium initially resulted in the appearance of products formed by cleavage at the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond, but surprisingly the reaction did not proceed to completion; minimal (<10%) cleavage occurred within 10 min but no further progress was observed over the course of one hour (Fig. 1, B and D, left panel). We hypothesized that a cleavage equilibrium might be established with about 90% intact and 10% cleaved trypsin forms present, corresponding to a Khyd = [cleaved]/[intact] of ∼0.1. To test our hypothesis that this was a true thermodynamic equilibrium, we asked whether CTRC could catalyze re-synthesis of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond. We generated two-chain cationic trypsin almost fully cleaved at Leu-81 by taking advantage of the empirical observation that trypsin is more readily cleaved by CTRC in the absence of calcium and the presence of 2 mm EDTA. When Leu-81-cleaved two-chain trypsin was supplemented with 3 mm calcium (i.e. 1 mm free calcium after chelating EDTA) and incubated with CTRC, intact, full-length trypsin accumulated as a function of time indicating re-synthesis of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond (Fig. 1, B and D, right panel). Importantly, the cleavage equilibrium (Khyd ∼0.1) was identical to that obtained in the forward cleavage reaction. Inhibition of CTRC by a high-affinity peptide inhibitor prevented re-formation of intact trypsin, confirming that re-synthesis of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond was catalyzed by CTRC (Fig. 2). Activation of trypsin from its precursor trypsinogen involves formation of an intramolecular salt bridge by the new N terminus, which results in structural stabilization of several loops that are disordered in trypsinogen, termed the “activation domain” (Fig. 1A). Although the Leu81–Glu82 bond lies within the calcium binding loop and is not part of the activation domain, we reasoned that its positioning adjacent to the activation domain might impact the thermodynamic stability of the bond. To determine whether CTRC cleavage of trypsinogen is characterized by a thermodynamic equilibrium similar to that of trypsin, we repeated our proteolysis experiments using cationic trypsinogen as the substrate. By contrast with trypsin, the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond in trypsinogen was fully cleaved by CTRC within 40 min and the primary cleavage products were further degraded. No re-synthesis of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond was detectable with Leu-81-cleaved two-chain cationic trypsinogen, which was also rapidly degraded by CTRC (Fig. 1, C and D). This observation reveals a novel mechanism of biological regulation that to our knowledge is unprecedented: the fundamental thermodynamic stability of a peptide bond is altered by the trypsinogen to trypsin transition, such that thermodynamic control favors cleavage and subsequent degradation for the zymogen versus stability for the active enzyme. Like other true catalysts, enzymes do not alter the relative thermodynamic stability of their substrates and products, and so do not shift chemical equilibria, but simply accelerate a chemical interconversion. We therefore anticipated that the high thermodynamic stability of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond in trypsin should be determined by the structure of the protein in the vicinity of the calcium binding loop and not by the cleaving protease (i.e. CTRC). Because the side-chain of Leu-81 points toward the solvent and does not participate in stabilizing interactions with neighboring amino acid residues, Leu-81 per se was predicted to be relatively unimportant for determining the cleavage equilibrium. To test these predictions, we mutated Leu-81 to Arg (L81R) in the inactive S200A trypsin background and carried out proteolysis experiments using a catalytic amount of active trypsin as the cleaving protease (Fig. 3A). To prevent tryptic cleavage at the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond, the construct also carried the R122A mutation (L81R,R122A,S200A). Although trypsin-mediated cleavage and re-synthesis of the Arg81–Glu82 peptide bond proceeded at a much slower rate than the analogous reactions with CTRC and a true equilibrium was not reached, the extrapolated hydrolytic equilibrium (Khyd ∼0.18) was comparable to that observed with CTRC acting on the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond. Similar results were obtained when the L81A trypsin mutant was incubated with human elastase 3B (CELA3B). This construct also carried mutation N84A, as previously we found that the L81A,N84A double mutant was cleaved by CELA3B at the Ala81–Glu82 peptide bond much more efficiently than the L81A mutant (18.Szabó A. Sahin-Tóth M. Determinants of chymotrypsin C cleavage specificity in the calcium-binding loop of human cationic trypsinogen.FEBS J. 2012; 279: 4283-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the Ala81–Glu82 peptide bond in the L81A,N84A,S200A mutant cationic trypsin was cleaved and re-synthesized by CELA3B, although neither reaction reached equilibrium during the time course studied and a Khyd value could not be assigned. More extended time courses resulted in degradation due to secondary cleavages. Taken together, properties of the L81R and L81A trypsin mutants clearly demonstrate that the high thermodynamic stability of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond is an inherent property of the protein not determined by Leu-81 or dependent on CTRC as the cleaving protease. The small changes in Khyd observed for the Leu-81 trypsin mutants are likely attributable to small adjustments in the local conformation of the calcium binding loop and an associated impact on stability. The experiments presented above were performed in 1 mm calcium, as this concentration approximates physiological levels in the pancreatic juice; at this concentration, the calcium site is expected to be fully occupied (6.Szmola R. Sahin-Tóth M. Chymotrypsin C (caldecrin) promotes degradation of human cationic trypsin: identity with Rinderknecht's enzyme Y.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Examination of the cationic trypsin structure reveals that calcium is coordinated by the carbonyl oxygens of Asn-77 and Val-80 and by the side chain carboxylates of Glu-75 and Glu-85 (Fig. 4A). Binding of calcium to trypsin is expected to limit the backbone conformational flexibility of the calcium binding loop, which may contribute to the high thermodynamic stability of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond. Indeed, when the forward cleavage reaction with CTRC was performed in 100 μm and 15 μm calcium concentrations, the Khyd values increased from 0.1 to 0.7 and 2.3, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that calcium dissociation dramatically decreases the thermodynamic stability of the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond, shifting the hydrolysis equilibrium. A likely explanation for these data is that by stabilizing the loop conformation, the bound calcium limits mobility of the newly formed termini after CTRC cleavage. Cleavage events that occur in more flexible regions of proteins proceed to completion, driven in part by the entropy gain realized due to increased rotational freedom of the newly formed termini (19.Niekamp C.W. Hixson Jr., H.F. Laskowski Jr., M. Peptide-bond hydrolysis equilibria in native proteins. Conversion of virgin into modified soybean trypsin inhibitor.Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20.Sealock R.W. Laskowski Jr., M. Thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactive site peptide-bond hydrolysis in bovine pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (Kazal).Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3139-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21.Finkenstadt W.R. Hamid M.A. Mattis J.A. Schrode J. Sealock R.W. Wang D. Laskowski Jr., M. Kinetics and thermodynamics of the interaction of proteinases with protein inhibitors.in: Fritz H. Tschesche H. Greene L. Truscheit E. Proteinase Inhibitors. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg1974: 389-411Crossref Google Scholar). Importantly, by restricting the mobility of the newly formed termini, the bound calcium ion will limit the gain in entropy upon cleavage, shifting the equilibrium toward the intact form. The structure suggests that calcium binding can directly dampen mobility for the residues of the loop that are N-terminal to Leu-81, by its coordination to Glu-75, Asn-77, and Val-80 (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the immobilization of C-terminal residues Glu-82, Gly-83, and Asn-84 appear to be dependent on bridging interactions of the Glu-85 carboxylate, which in addition to coordinating calcium lies within hydrogen bonding distance of the backbone amide nitrogens of Glu-82, Gly-83, Asn-84, and Glu-85 itself (Fig. 4A). To test the critical nature of these bridging interactions, we mutated Glu-85 to alanine. The Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond in the E85A,S200A mutant trypsin was almost completely cleaved by CTRC, yielding a Khyd value of ∼20 (Fig. 4, B and C). Trypsin and trypsinogen degradation require dual initial proteolytic events at CTRC nick site Leu81–Glu82 and at trypsin nick site Arg122–Val123. The trypsin nick site lies in a loop adjacent to the calcium-binding loop (Fig. 1A), and is conformationally stabilized by a hydrogen bond network (Fig. 5A). We previously found that the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond in human cationic trypsinogen also exhibits appreciable thermodynamic stability (22.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Human cationic trypsinogen. Arg117 is the reactive site of an inhibitory surface loop that controls spontaneous zymogen activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although the significance of this phenomenon has remained unknown. Trypsinolytic cleavage of the Arg122–Val123 bond in the physiologically relevant calcium concentration range (0.5–5 mm) led to a cleavage/re-synthesis equilibrium with Khyd ∼0.7 (22.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Human cationic trypsinogen. Arg117 is the reactive site of an inhibitory surface loop that controls spontaneous zymogen activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although not characterized quantitatively, the high thermodynamic stability of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond was also observed in trypsin (22.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine (a) whether calcium is important for the thermodynamic stability of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond (as it clearly is for the Leu81–Glu82 peptide bond), and (b) whether the transition of trypsinogen to trypsin modulates the thermodynamic stability of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond (as it does for the Leu81-Glu82 peptide bond), we measured Khyd values at different calcium concentrations in trypsin and trypsinogen. In these experiments the inactive S200A trypsin mutant and the non-activable K23Q trypsinogen mutant were cleaved with a catalytic quantity of cationic trypsin. The Arg122–Val123 peptide bond was cleaved in trypsin slowly and a true equilibrium was only reached at 15 μm calcium (Khyd 1.0) within the time course studied (Fig. 5, B and C, left panel). The extrapolated hydrolysis equilibrium in 100 μm calcium seemed to approach the same Khyd value, whereas in 1 mm calcium the rate of cleavage was so slow that a cleavage equilibrium could not be estimated reliably. Nonetheless, it appeared that calcium has only a small effect, if any, on the Khyd of the Arg122–Val123 peptide bond in trypsin. Consistent with previous observations (22.Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G.

However it remains unknown whether modulation of dendritic excitability is controlled by synaptic changes or whether it can be distinct from them. Here we report the first observation of the induction of a persistent plastic decrease in dendritic excitability decoupled from synaptic stimulation, which is localized and purely activity-based. In rats this local plasticity decrease is conferred by CamKII mediated phosphorylation of A-type potassium channels upon interaction of a back propagating action potential (bAP) with dendritic depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2041108727,"Interest in cell heterogeneity and differentiation has recently led to increased use of time-lapse microscopy. Previous studies have shown that cell fate may be determined well in advance of the event. We used a mixture of automation and manual review of time-lapse live cell imaging to track the positions, contours, divisions, deaths and lineage of 44 B-lymphocyte founders and their 631 progeny in vitro over a period of 108 hours. Using this data to train a Support Vector Machine classifier, we were retrospectively able to predict the fates of individual lymphocytes with more than 90% accuracy, using only time-lapse imaging captured prior to mitosis or death of 90% of all cells. The motivation for this paper is to explore the impact of labour-efficient assistive software tools that allow larger and more ambitious live-cell time-lapse microscopy studies. After training on this data, we show that machine learning methods can be used for realtime prediction of individual cell fates. These techniques could lead to realtime cell culture segregation for purposes such as phenotype screening. We were able to produce a large volume of data with less effort than previously reported, due to the image processing, computer vision, tracking and human-computer interaction tools used. We describe the workflow of the software-assisted experiments and the graphical interfaces that were needed. To validate our results we used our methods to reproduce a variety of published data about lymphocyte populations and behaviour. We also make all our data publicly available, including a large quantity of lymphocyte spatio-temporal dynamics and related lineage information."

R. China). The anticipating model for GPC of winter wheat was also established by the approach of NDVI at the different stages of winter wheat. The results showed that the spectrum models of PNC passed F test. The NDVI4.14 regression effect of PNC model of irrigated winter wheat was the best, and that in dry land was NDVI4.30. The PNC of irrigated and dry land winter wheat were significantly (P<0.01) and positively correlated to GPC. Both of protein spectral anticipating model of irrigated and dry land winter wheat passed a significance test (P<0.01). Multiple anticipating models (MAM) were established by NDVI from two periods of irrigated and dry land winter wheat and PNC to link GPC anticipating model. The coefficient of determination R(2) (R) of MAM was greater than that of the other two single-factor models. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) and relative error (RE) of MAM were lower than those of the other two single-factor models. Therefore, test effects of multiple proteins anticipating model were better than those of single-factor models. The application of multiple anticipating models for predication of protein content (PC) of irrigated and dry land winter wheat was more accurate and reliable. The regionalization analysis of GPC was performed using inverse distance weighted function of GIS, which is likely to provide the scientific basis for the reasonable winter wheat planting in Linfen city, China."

Samples with multiple infections were cloned, and sequence data submitted to phylogenetic analysis. We were able to identify 17 HIV-1 multiple infections out of 47 samples. Multiple infections were mostly composed by a mixture of recombinant viruses (94%), with only one case in which protease gene pure subtypes B and F were recovered. This is the first study that reports the prevalence of multiple infections and intersubtype recombinants in a population undergoing HAART in Brazil. Based on the data there was a steep increase of multiple infections after the introduction of the combined antiretroviral therapy in Brazil. Cases of multiple infections may be associated with HIV-1 genetic diversity through recombination allowing for the generation of viruses showing a combination of resistance mutations."
