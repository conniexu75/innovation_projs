We have isolated a new member of this family, designated Apo-2 ligand (Apo-2L), via an expressed sequence tag. Apo-2L is a 281-amino acid protein, related most closely to Fas/Apo-1 ligand. Transfected Apo-2L is expressed at the cell surface with its C terminus exposed, indicating a type II transmembrane protein topology. Like Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, the C-terminal extracellular region of Apo-2L (amino acids 114-281) exhibits a homotrimeric subunit structure. Soluble Apo-2L induces extensive apoptosis in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid tumor cell lines. The effect of Apo-2L is not inhibited by soluble Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors; moreover, expression of human Fas/Apo-1 in mouse fibroblasts, which confers sensitivity to induction of apoptosis by agonistic anti-Fas/Apo-1 antibody, does not confer sensitivity to Apo-2L. Hence, Apo-2L acts via a receptor which is distinct from Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors. These results suggest that, along with other family members such as Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, Apo-2L may serve as an extracellular signal that triggers programmed cell death.

Most TNF family cytokines are expressed as type II transmembrane proteins, whose C-terminal extracellular domain is processed proteolytically to form a soluble homotrimeric molecule. In contrast, the members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family are type I transmembrane proteins.

Members of the TNF family have diverse biological actions, including T cell co-stimulation, induction of B cell proliferation and differentiation, and macrophage activation (1Beutler B. van Huffel C.

In addition, certain TNF family members regulate the elimination of unwanted immune cells by inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis). For example, Fas/Apo-1 ligand (Fas/Apo-1L) plays a key role in peripheral deletion of self-reactive lymphocytes, as suggested by the autoimmune phenotype of the mouse mutations lpr and gld, which occur, respectively, in the Fas/Apo-1 receptor or ligand genes (4Krammer P.H. Behrmann I. Daniel P. Dhein J. Debatin K.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). In addition, Fas/Apo-1L is involved in apoptosis of B cells and CD4+ T cells subsequent to stimulation by antigen, while TNF mediates a similar function in CD8+ T cells (4Krammer P.H. Behrmann I. Daniel P. Dhein J. Debatin K.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5Nagata S. Golstein P.

Lynch D.H. Lenardo M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In this article, we describe a new member of the TNF cytokine family. We have designated this protein Apo-2L, because it resembles the Fas/Apo-1L in its amino acid sequence, as well as in its ability to induce apoptosis. Apo-2L appears to act via a receptor which is distinct from Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors, suggesting that its biological role is unique. To isolate a full-length cDNA that contains the sequence of expressed sequenced tag (EST) HHEA47M, a λgt11 bacteriophage library of human placental cDNA (~1 × 106 clones) (HL1075b, Clontech) was screened by hybridization to an oligonucleotide probe based on the 390-base pair EST (TGACGAAGAGAGTATGAACAGCCCCTGCTGGCAAGTCAAGTGGCAACTCCGTCAGCTCGT) and rescreened with a second, non-overlapping EST-based probe (GGTGAACTGGTCATCCATGAAAAAGGGTTTTACTACATCTATTCCCAAACATACTTTCGA). Of 12 independent clones that hybridized with both probes, 3 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers based on flanking vector sequence, subcloned into pGEM-T by T-A ligation (Promega), and subjected to dideoxy DNA sequencing. A mammalian expression pRK5 plasmid (8Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Gatanaga T. Granger G.A. Lentz R. Raab H. Kohr W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1990; 61: 361-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) encoding full-length Apo-2L fused to a C-terminal Myc epitope tag was cotransfected into human 293 cells with a second pRK5 plasmid that carries a neomycin resistance gene, by calcium phosphate precipitation. Stable clones expressing Apo-2L-myc were selected by ability to grow in the presence of the antibiotic G418 (0.5 mg/ml). Expression of Apo-2L-myc was assessed by FACS analysis using anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (9Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar) (Oncogene Science). Apo-2L codons 114-281 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into a modified baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen) in-frame and downstream of a sequence encoding a His10 tag and an enterokinase cleavage site. This His10-Apo-2L vector and BaculoGold™ virus DNA (Pharmingen) were cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) cells (ATCC) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 4-5 days of incubation at 28°C, the released viruses were harvested and used for further amplifications, as described (10O'Reilley D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors, a Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared as described (11Ruppert S. Wang E.H. Tijan R. Nature. 1993; 362: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and subjected to chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). His10-Apo-2L was eluted with a 0 to 500 mM imidazole gradient. Fractions containing the eluted His10-Apo-2L protein were pooled and dialyzed to remove the imidazole. To generate a control for the baculovirus-derived Apo-2L, we prepared lysates from mock-infected SF9 cells and processed them by an identical purification protocol; the same eluted column fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and used as the control in all experiments. Induction of apoptosis was assessed by examination of morphological changes by light microscopy, by FACS analysis, and by analysis of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. For FACS analysis, cells were stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and by the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI). Cells negative for both PI and annexin V staining are live cells; PI-negative, annexin V-positive staining cells are early apoptotic cells; PI-positive, annexin V-positive staining cells are primarily cells in late stages of apoptosis (12Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong G.

Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation was analyzed as described (16Moore A. Donahue C.J. Hooley J. Stocks D.L. Bauer K.D. Mather J.P. Cytotechnology. 1995; 17: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To find new members of the TNF cytokine family that may regulate apoptosis, we searched the DNA data bases for ESTs that show some homology to Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF. We identified one such EST, HHEA47M. Northern blot hybridization using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on this EST indicated expression of an ~2-kilobase mRNA transcript in human fetal lung, liver, and kidney, and in human adult spleen, thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, colon, peripheral blood lymphocytes, heart, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney (data not shown). Subsequently, we screened a human placental cDNA library for clones that hybridize specifically to two non-overlapping probes based on this EST. Sequence analysis of 3 positive clones demonstrated that they were identical except for some length variation at their 5′ ends; a polyadenylation sequence was found at the 3′ region (not shown). The cDNA has one long open reading frame (Fig. 1A). The initiation site was assigned to the ATG codon at nucleotide positions 91-93 based upon similarity to the proposed consensus sequence for translational initiation sites (17Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar) and on the presence of two in-frame stop codons preceding the ATG. The predicted polypeptide, which we designated Apo-2L, is 281 amino acids long, with a calculated molecular mass of 32.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.63. There is no apparent signal sequence at the N terminus, although a hydrophobic region occurs between residues 15 and 40, suggesting a type II protein topology. A potential extracellular N-linked glycosylation site is located at residue 109. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region of Apo-2L with that of the previously known members of the TNF family (Fig. 1B) reveals some homology particularly in regions presumed to form β strands based on the crystal structures of TNF and lymphotoxin α (LTα) (18Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Eck M.J. Ultsch M. Rinderknecht E. de Vos A.M. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2119-2122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loop connecting putative β strands B and B′ is relatively long in Apo-2L. In its C-terminal region, aligned as shown in Fig. 1B, Apo-2L exhibits the most identity to Fas/Apo-1L (23.2%), followed by CD40L (20.8%), LTα (20.2%), LTβ (19.6%), TNF (19.0%), CD30L and CD27L (15.5%), OX-40L (14.3%), and 4-1BBL (13.7%). These numbers are within the range of identities found between other TNF family members (2Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar, 3Gruss H.J. Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the cellular topology of Apo-2L, we transfected human 293 cells with an expression plasmid in which full-length Apo-2L cDNA was fused to a C-terminal Myc epitope tag. FACS analysis revealed a positive shift in anti-Myc mAb staining of cells transfected with the Apo-2L-myc plasmid, as compared to cells transfected with an Apo-2L plasmid lacking the Myc epitope (Fig. 1C). This result shows that Myc-tagged Apo-2L is expressed at the cell surface, with its carboxyl terminus exposed, thus confirming the type II protein topology predicted by the amino acid sequence of Apo-2L. Alignment of the Apo-2L sequence with that of TNF, whose extracellular processing site is known (3Gruss H.J. Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggested a potential cleavage site in Apo-2L approximately 7 residues upstream of the first β strand region (see Fig. 1B). Hence, to provide soluble Apo-2L for further analysis, we expressed a baculovirus transfer vector in which a His10 sequence was fused at the N terminus of Apo-2L codons 114-281 in SF9 cells and purified the protein from cell lysates by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a predominant 24-kDa protein band and additional bands of approximately 48 and 66 kDa (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Protein microsequence analysis (data not shown) confirmed the identity of the 24-kDa band as His10-Apo-2L. When the purified protein was subjected to chemical cross-linking, more of the protein migrated as a 66-kDa band (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). Hence, the 48- and 66-kDa bands probably represent dimeric and trimeric forms of soluble Apo-2L. To investigate the biological activity of soluble Apo-2L, we screened several lymphocyte cell lines for responsiveness to the purified protein. Apo-2L caused a marked reduction in cell number and morphological changes in 9D cells, an Epstein Barr virus-transformed human B cell line (Fig. 2A). An anti-Fas/Apo-1 mAb which mimics the action of Fas/Apo-1L (20Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) induced similar effects (Fig. 2A). FACS analysis of Apo-2L-treated 9D cells showed a marked decrease in forward light scatter, indicating cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation, which are characteristic of apoptosis (data not shown) (12Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong G. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 15-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition, Apo-2L-treated 9D cells exhibited elevated extracellular annexin V binding, as well as an increase in uptake of PI (Fig. 2B), providing further evidence for induction of apoptosis (14Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Choen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2214PubMed Google Scholar, 15Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparable results were obtained with anti-Fas/Apo-1 mAb (Fig. 2B). Apo-2L also induced apoptosis in Raji, a human Burkitt's lymphoma B cell line, and in Jurkat, an acute human leukemia T cell line, as did the anti-Fas/Apo-1 mAb (Fig. 2, C and D). Additional studies in Jurkat and in 9D cells showed that Apo-2L induces marked internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis (21Cohen J.J. Adv. Immunol. 1991; 50: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), within a period of 2 h (Fig. 2E). Next, we assessed whether Apo-2L can induce apoptosis in additional human tumor cell lines. HeLa cervical carcinoma cells, U937 hystiocytic lymphoma cells, A549 lung carcinoma cells, and ME180 cervical carcinoma cells all exhibited a marked increase in cell death when treated with Apo-2L (Table I). Notably, the latter three cell lines were more sensitive to Apo-2L than to the anti-Fas/Apo-1, whereas 293 cells were unaffected by Apo-2L and responded weakly to anti-Fas/Apo-1. These results show that Apo-2L can induce apoptosis in tumor cell lines from lymphoid as well as from non-lymphoid tissue origins.Table I.Induction of apoptosis in tumor cell linesCell line% apoptotic cellsaPercent of 50,000 cells analyzed per data point that stain positively with annexin V-FITC.

Cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Open table in a new tab The differential sensitivity of several of the cell lines to induction of cell death by Apo-2L or anti-Fas/Apo-1 mAb suggested that the two factors may act via distinct receptors. To examine this further, we tested whether a Fas/Apo-1-IgG fusion protein (immunoadhesin), which has been shown previously to block Fas/Apo-1L-induced apoptosis (7Zheng L. Fisher G. Miller R.E. Peschon J. Lynch D.H. Lenardo M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 22Dhein J. Walczak H. Baumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), can inhibit Apo-2L function. In addition, we tested the effect of TNFR1 and TNFR2 immunoadhesins, both of which have been shown previously to block TNF function (23Ashkenazi A. Marsters S.A. Capon D.J. Chamow S.M. Figari I.S. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. Palladino M.A. Smith D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10535-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 24Howard O.M.Z. Clouse K.A. Smith C. Goodwin R.G. Farrar W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2335-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Dose-response analysis of Apo-2L-induced apoptosis in 9D cells showed half-maximal induction at ~20 ng/ml (~0.25 nM) Apo-2L, and maximal induction at 0.5-1 µg/ml (6-12 nM) (Fig. 3A). Neither Fas/Apo-1-IgG, nor TNFR1-IgG, nor TNFR2-IgG inhibited the effect of Apo-2L on 9D cells (Fig. 3B), supporting the notion that Apo-2L-induced cell death is independent of Fas/Apo-1 and of TNFR1 or TNFR2. We tested also the ability of Apo-2L as compared with anti-Fas/Apo-1 mAb to induce apoptosis in mouse L929 cells stably transfected with human Fas/Apo-1. Expression of Fas/Apo-1 in these cells did not affect the sensitivity to Apo-2L, but conferred marked sensitivity to anti-Fas/Apo-1 mAb (Fig. 3C). This result substantiates further the conclusion that Apo-2L acts independently of Fas/Apo-1. Notably, Apo-2L induced some apoptosis in both mouse cell lines, suggesting that the human ligand can interact to some extent with the murine Apo-2 receptor. Our results extend the TNF cytokine family to include one additional member. We have designated this protein Apo-2L, because of its structural and functional similarity to Fas/Apo-1L. Importantly, Apo-2L appears to act through a receptor which is distinct from Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors. Apo-2L exhibits several structural properties characteristic of the TNF family, including extracellular sequence homology, a type II transmembrane protein topology, and an ability to form homotrimers in solution. Furthermore, Apo-2L resembles TNF family cytokines such as Fas/Apo-1L and TNF (3Gruss H.J. Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Krammer P.H. Behrmann I. Daniel P.

Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar) in its ability to induce programmed cell death in tumor cell lines from various tissue origins. Hence, Apo-2L may have potential utility as an anti-cancer agent."
https://openalex.org/W2095441352,"One of the assumptions of the mobile receptor hypothesis as it relates to G protein-coupled receptors is that the stoichiometry of receptor, G protein, and effector is 1:1:1 (Bourne, H. R., Sanders, D. A., and McCormick, F. (1990) Nature 348, 125–132). Many studies on the cooperativity of agonist binding are incompatible with this notion and have suggested that both G proteins and their associated receptors can be oligomeric. However, a clear physical demonstration that G protein-coupled receptors can indeed interact as dimers and that such interactions may have functional consequences was lacking. Here, using differential epitope tagging we demonstrate that β2-adrenergic receptors do form SDS-resistant homodimers and that transmembrane domain VI of the receptor may represent part of an interface for receptor dimerization. The functional importance of dimerization is supported by the observation that a peptide derived from this domain that inhibits dimerization also inhibits β-adrenergic agonist-promoted stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, agonist stimulation was found to stabilize the dimeric state of the receptor, while inverse agonists favored the monomeric species, which suggests that interconversion between monomeric and dimeric forms may be important for biological activity.

Similarly, co-expression of two binding defective angiotensin II receptor mutants was recently demonstrated to rescue the binding for the peptide (17Monnot C. Bihoreau C. Conchon C. Curnow K.M. Corvol Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1507-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The use of “split” receptors also suggests that GPCRs behave in some respects like two subunit proteins. Co-expression of truncated β2AR containing transmembrane segments I-V and VI-VII resulted in formation of functional receptors, while expression of either truncation alone yielded no signaling (18Kobilka B.K.

The importance of oligomerization in normal G protein-coupled receptor signaling is poorly characterized and a direct demonstration that GPCR dimers exist is lacking. In other transmembrane signaling systems, however, the role of receptor dimer is better understood. Many growth factor receptors are known to act functionally and structurally as dimers (for review, see 19Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). These include the EGF-R (20Yarden Y. Schlessinger J.

Cell. 1991; 66: 257-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the high affinity binding site on these receptors occurs only in their dimeric forms (20Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 21Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Indeed for the EGF-R, the high affinity state can be stabilized by the introduction of interreceptor disulfide bonds (27Sorokin A. Lemmon M.A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal for the formation of these dimers seems to be activation by ligand. Dimers are also seen in many bacterial sensory receptors, including those for aspartate and serine (for review, see 28Kim S.-H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and 29Stock J.B. Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, it is less clear whether or not these receptors dimerize upon activation by ligand (30Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1991; 254: 1651-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9904-9911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Biemann H.-P. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The notion that GPCRs may also dimerize in response to activation by ligand has not been tested. In this study we sought to determine whether monomeric GPCRs interact either functionally and/or physically as homodimers using a variety of approaches. These included expression of β2ARs in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system where differential epitope tagging was used, as well as stable expression of β2AR in LTK− and CHW cells. We also transiently expressed wild-type and truncated forms of the V2 vasopressin receptor in COS-7 cells. In order to determine the functional correlate of receptor dimerization, we measured the effect of disrupting dimerization on the ability of the receptor to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. Finally, we were interested in the effects of different β2AR ligands on the equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms of the receptor. The recombinant baculoviruses encoding the c-myc or hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type human β2-adrenergic receptor, the c-myc-tagged human M2 muscarinic receptor, and c-myc-tagged D1 dopamine receptor (c-myc β2AR and HA-β2AR, c-myc M2-R, and c-myc D1-R, respectively) were constructed as described (33Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HA (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) and c-myc (Glu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-Leu) tags containing initiator methionine residues were introduced into the receptor cDNAs immediately before their initiator methionines by subcloning the corresponding double-stranded oligonucleotides. Cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at multiplicities of infection ranging from 3 to 5. Sf9 cells are maintained at 27°C in serum-supplemented (10% fetal bovine serum, v/v) Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with gentamycin and fungizone. Cells were grown either as monolayers in T flasks or in suspension in spinner bottles supplemented with pluronic acid to prevent cell tearing due to agitation. Cells were infected at log phase at a density of 1 × 106 to 2 × 106 cells/ml for 48 h. CHW and LTK− cell lines with and without stably transfected β2AR were maintained as described (34Moffett S. Mouillac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with L-glutamate, 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamycin, and fungizone. Transfected CHW cells expressed ∼5 pmol of receptor/mg of protein, while transfected LTK− cells expressed 200 fmol of receptor/mg of protein. Stably transfected cell lines were grown in the presence of 150 µg/ml G418. For transient expression of V2 vasopressin receptors the following procedures were followed. COS-7 cells were maintained in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described above. Genomic DNA for the V2 vasopressin receptor was isolated from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus patients or unaffected individuals, subcloned into a construct containing a c-myc epitope tag, and ligated into a mammalian expression vector, pBC12BI (35Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Using DEAE-dextran, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector encoding either wild-type V2 vasopressin receptor, a truncation mutant O-11, or with vector alone for 48 h. Sf9 or mammalian cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then disrupted by homogenization with a Polytron in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA (plus a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml benzamidine, and 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C, the pellets homogenized as before, spun again, and the supernatants were pooled. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min and the pellets washed twice in the same buffer. In some cases receptors were then solubilized in 2% digitonin or 0.3% N-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside and purified by affinity chromatography on alprenolol-Sepharose as or by immunoprecipitation as described below. Solubilized receptors were affinity-purified by alprenolol-Sepharose chromatography as described (33Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Shorr R.G.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5820-5826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity-purified preparations were concentrated using Centriprep and Centricon cartridges (Amicon), and the amount of β2AR in each sample was determined in soluble 125I-CYP radioligand binding assays as described (33Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified receptors were desalted on Sephadex G-50 columns prior to SDS-PAGE. Tagged β2ARs were immunoprecipitated with either a mouse anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; 37Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) or a mouse anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (12CA5; 38Nimar H.L. Houghten R.A. Walker L.E. Reisfeld R.A. Wilson I.A. Hogle J.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4949-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) as described previously (33Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of digitonin and concentration of the solubilized receptor was performed by dialysis using Centriprep cartridges (Amicon) against an ice-cold solution (Buffer A) containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA (plus protease inhibitors described above) until the digitonin concentration was reduced below 0.05%. Purified 9E10 or 12CA5 antibody (1:1000 dilution) was added to the concentrate and gently agitated for 2 h at 4°C. Anti-mouse IgG agarose (Sigma; at an 11:1 secondary to primary antibody molar ratio) and protease inhibitor mixture were then added. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. The immunoprecipitate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was washed three times in buffer A and finally resuspended in 200 µl of nonreducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 30 min, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described below. Ten ml of Sf9 cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) were taken 48 h post-infection and either mock-treated with vehicle or treated with 1 mg of the membrane permeant photoactivatible cross-linking agent BASED (bis[β-(4 azidosalicylamindo)ethyl] disulfide; Pierce) for 60 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Membranes were then prepared from cells as described above and resuspended in nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Gels were subsequently immunoblotted as described below. Membrane preparations from Sf9 or mammalian cells or in some cases affinity-purified or immunoprecipitated β2AR were prepared for nonreducing SDS-PAGE on 10% slab gels as described previously (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). In the case of the V2 vasopressin receptors, reducing SDS-PAGE was performed. For Western blotting, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with either the mouse anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10), the anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (12CA5) at dilutions of 1:1000, or in the case of mammalian cells expressing the β2AR, a polyclonal rabbit anti- β2AR antiserum raised against a peptide from the COOH-terminal region of the β2AR at a dilution of 1:2000 (a generous gift of Dr. A. D. Strosberg, Institut Cochin de Génétique Moleculaire, Paris). Immunoblots against the anti-c-myc or anti-HA antibodies were revealed using a goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-coupled second antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) or a chemiluminescent substrate for a horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibody (Renaissance, NEN DuPont). For the experiments performed using mammalian cells expressing the β2AR Western blots were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate for goat anti-rabbit-coupled horseradish peroxidase antisera (Sigma). To assess total immunoreactivity of the various receptor species, blots were scanned by laser densitometry (Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Ultrascan). Peptides were synthesized on solid-phase supports using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (40Stewart J. Young J. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL1984Google Scholar) on a BioLynx 4175 manual peptide synthesizer (LKB). Peptides were solubilized in the following buffer: 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA (plus the protease inhibitor mixture described above), 0.05% digitonin, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Peptide sequences were confirmed either by mass spectrometry or amino acid analysis. Peptides used were as follows: 1) β2AR TM VI peptide consisting of residues 276–296; NH2-GIIMGTFTLCWLPFFIVNIVH-COOH, 2) a second peptide with Ala residues substituted at positions 276, 280, and 284 NH2-AIIMATFTACWLPFFIVNIVH-COOH, 3) a peptide derived from residues 407–426 of the D2 dopamine receptor TM VII NH2-YIIPNVASNVYGLWTFASYL-COOH, 4) a peptide derived from the COOH-terminal tail of the β2AR consisting of residues 347–358 NH2-LKAYGNGYSSNG-COOH, and 5) an additional peptide unrelated to the β2AR but of similar size as the TM VI peptide NH2-SIQHLSTGHDHDDVDVGEQQ-COOH. To assess the effect of the different peptides or β2AR ligands on the relative amount of different receptor species the following experiments were performed. Membrane preparations from mammalian or Sf9 cells or affinity-purified receptors derived from Sf9 cells expressing c-myc-tagged β2AR were treated increasing concentrations of the different peptides at room temperature for various times as indicated under “Results and Discussion.” Samples were then run on SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. In some cases membrane preparations were also treated with either 10 µM timolol or 1 µM isoproterenol instead of, or in addition to, the different peptides. Membranes were also used to determine the effect of various peptides on the ability of the β2AR to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity described below. Receptor number was calculated from saturation binding experiments using 125I-CYP as the radioligand (41Bouvier M. Hnatowich M. Collins S. Kobilka B.K. De Blasi A. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 33: 133-139Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 µl of a membrane preparation in a total volume of 0.5 ml was labeled with 250 pmol of 125I-CYP, which is at a near saturating concentration. Nonspecific binding was defined using 10 µM alprenolol. Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed by the method of Salomon et al. (42Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared and washed as described above. Again 10 µl of membranes (3–5 µg of protein) were used in a total volume of 50 µl. In some experiments, the peptides or the buffer used to solubilize them were added to the enzyme assay mix. Enzyme activities were determined in the presence of 1 nM to 100 µM isoproterenol, 100 µM forskolin, or 10 mM NaF. Data were calculated as picomoles cAMP produced per min/mg of protein and were analyzed by least squares regression using SigmaPlot 4.17 (Jandel Scientific). Immunoblotting of c-myc epitope-tagged β2AR expressed in Sf9 cells with the anti-c-myc antibody consistently revealed the presence of molecular species corresponding to the anticipated monomeric receptor (43–50 kDa) in Sf9 cells (33Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21733-21737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as higher molecular weight forms. In particular, a prominent band was detected at an apparent molecular weight corresponding to twice that of the monomer (85–95 kDa), suggesting the existence of an SDS-resistant dimeric species of the receptor. In some membrane preparations, discrete bands, which could represent even higher order structures of the β2AR, can also be detected (Fig. 1, lane 1). The dimer, which was readily observed in membrane preparations, was also detected in digitonin-solubilized receptors (lane 2) and following affinity purification of receptors on alprenolol-Sepharose (lane 3). As shown in lanes 4 and 5, when whole cells expressing the β2AR were treated with the membrane-permeant cross-linking agent BASED, the dimer to monomer ratio as assessed by immunoblotting was increased by 2-fold. This suggests that the dimer is already present before cell fractionation and that cross-linking stabilizes this form of the receptor. Therefore, the dimeric species does not represent an artifact of membrane preparation or solubilization. Identical results were obtained when membranes were solubilized with 0.3% N-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside instead of digitonin (data not shown). High molecular weight species have been previously observed for several GPCRs. Although some authors have suggested that these species may represent receptor dimers (14Herberg J.T. Codina J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In order to directly determine if the higher molecular weight species observed in this study corresponded to a specific β2AR homodimer, we devised a differential co-immunoprecipitation strategy using c-myc and HA epitope tagging. Human β2ARs bearing either of these tags were co-expressed in Sf9 cells. The receptors were then immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA or anti-c-myc antibodies, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted with one or the other antibody. In the results shown in Fig. 2 the anti-HA mAb was used to blot receptors immunoprecipitated with either the anti-HA or the anti-c-myc mAb. As seen in lane 2, blotting of the anti-HA immunoprecipitate revealed both the 45-kDa and the 90-kDa forms of the receptor. The β2AR could also be detected by the anti-HA mAb in the c-myc immunoprecipitate of co-expressed receptors but the dimer then represented the predominant form (lane 1). This indicates that the two molecular species (HA-tagged and c-myc-tagged β2ARs) were co-immunoprecipitated as part of a complex, which is stable in SDS, consistent with the higher molecular weight form being a β2AR homodimer. Similar but complementary results are obtained when co-expressed receptors are immunoprecipitated with either anti-c-myc or anti-HA antibodies and then immunoblotted with the anti-c-myc antibody (data not shown). The specificity of the mAbs is illustrated by the absence of cross-reactivity in cells expressing one tagged receptor species only (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6). The occurrence of intermolecular interactions appears to be receptor-specific. Indeed, although dimers of c-myc-tagged M2 muscarinic receptor could be detected in Sf9-derived membranes expressing this receptor (data not shown and 51Deleted in proof.Google Scholar), no co-immunoprecipitation with the HA-tagged β2AR was detected when the two receptors were co-expressed (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). The V2 vasopressin receptor is critical for regulation of water retention in the kidney (53Harris H.W. Zeidel M.L. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 516-531Google Scholar). Recently, several mutations of this receptor have been linked to congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, 54Bichet D.G. Birnbaumer M. Lonergan M. Arthus M.-F. Rosenthal W. Goodyer P. Nivet H. Benoit S. Giampietro P. Simonetti S. Fish A. Whitley C.B. Jaeger P. Gertner J. New M. DiBona F.J. Kaplan B.S. Robertson G.L. Hendy G.N. Fujiwara T.M. Morgan K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 278-286PubMed Google Scholar). In another approach to demonstrate GPCR dimer formation, transient expression of both wild-type and a truncated form of the V2 vasopressin receptor in COS-7 cells was studied. Both monomeric (∼64-69 kDa) and dimeric (∼120-135 kDa) forms of the wild-type human V2 vasopressin receptor were detected when expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, lane 1). A mutant form of the V2 receptor truncated in the COOH-terminal tail at residue 337 (O-11, isolated from a patient with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, 54Bichet D.G. Birnbaumer M. Lonergan M. Arthus M.-F. Rosenthal W. Goodyer P. Nivet H. Benoit S. Giampietro P. Simonetti S. Fish A. Whitley C.B. Jaeger P. Gertner J. New M. DiBona F.J. Kaplan B.S. Robertson G.L. Hendy G.N. Fujiwara T.M. Morgan K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 278-286PubMed Google Scholar) was also capable of forming dimers when expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, lane 2). Indeed, the O-11 V2 receptor was detected as ∼55-58-kDa and ∼89-100-kDa species, consistent with the idea that the higher molecular weight form represents a homodimer. These results confirm by a different approach that G protein-coupled receptors can form SDS-resistant dimers when expressed in mammalian cells. A number of chemical treatments failed to convert the dimeric species of the β2AR to a monomeric form. These included reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol and the denaturants urea or guanidinium hydrochloride (data not shown). Other examples of SDS-resistant oligomers of membrane proteins have been noted in the literature. These include glycophorin A (GpA, 55Furthmayr H. Marchesi V.T.

A new class of compounds has recently been developed (SC-58125) that have a high degree of selectivity for the inducible form of cyxlooxygenase (COX-2) over the constitutive form (COX-1). This unique class of compounds exhibit a time-dependent irreversible inhibition of COX-2, while reversibly inhibiting COX-1. The molecular basis of this selectivity was probed by site-directed mutagenesis of the active site of COX-2. The sequence differences in the active site were determined by amino acid replacement of the COX-2 sequences based on the known crystal structure of COX-1, which revealed a single amino acid difference in the active site (valine 509 to isoleucine) and a series of differences at the mouth of the active site. Mutants with the single amino acid substitution in the active site and a combination of three changes in the mouth of the active site were made in human COX-2, expressed in insect cells and purified. The single amino acid change of valine 509 to isoleucine confers selectivity of COX-2 inhibitors in the class of SC-58125 and others of the same class (SC-236, NS-398), while commonly used NSAIDs such as indomethacin showed no change in selectivity. Substitutions of COX-1 sequences in COX-2 at the mouth of the active site of COX-2 did not change the selectivity of SC-58125. This indicates that the single amino acid substitution of isoleucine at position 509 for a valine is sufficient to confer COX-2 selectivity in this example of a diaryl-heterocycle COX inhibitor.

Prostaglandin synthase catalyzes two separate reactions; the first being the cyclooxygenase function, which is the addition of molecular oxygen to arachidonic acid to form the unstable PGG2, 1The abbreviations used are: PGprostaglandinCOXcyclooxygenaseNSAIDnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsssvsheep seminal vesiclehhumanCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonateTMPDN,N,N′N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamineKPO4potassium phosphate bufferELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. and the second the further conversion of PGG2 to the more stable PGH2 by a peroxidase function. Hence, this “cyclooxygenase” (COX) enzyme performs the critical initial reaction in the arachidonic metabolic cascade leading to the formation of the prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin (1Needleman P.

This suggests that clinically useful NSAIDs inhibit pro-inflammatory PGs derived from the activity of COX-2, as well as PGs in tissues like the stomach and kidney (via COX-1). These homeostatic PGs are linked to normal gastric and renal function (15Haynes R.C. Gilman A.G. Rall T.W. Nies S. Taylor P. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. Pergamon Press Inc., New York1990: 1431Google Scholar). It is possible that a selective COX-2 inhibitor may eliminate the side effects associated with COX-1 inhibition while providing anti-inflammatory COX-2 inhibition. A new class of compounds has been described that are all selective inhibitors of COX-2. Compounds such as NS-398, DUP-697, and SC-58125 have been key in elucidating the physiological role of the two types of enzymes. These compounds have both in vivo and in vitro selectivity (9Masferrer J.L. Zweifel B. Manning P.T. Hauser S.D. Leahy K.M. Smith W.G. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been demonstrated that the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 exhibits a time-dependent inactivation of COX-2 and no time dependence versus COX-1. The mechanism of this time dependence is unknown. Inhibitor enzyme complexes can be separated after protein denaturation with no change in either the inhibitor or protein (17Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, it is apparently a very tight binding interaction and not a covalent one. Sequence alignment of the two enzymes offers little insight into the differences between the two enzymes at or around the active site. Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of sheep seminal vesicle COX-1 has been solved (18Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar), which gives insight into the structure of the active site. The sequence of COX-2 can be overlaid on the structure, and the differences can be mapped. Major sequence differences were found in the mouth of the substrate access channel and one difference in the active site channel. Therefore, mutants of COX-2 were constructed and expressed to evaluate specific residues for their contribution to the selective inhibition of compounds. Arachidonic acid was purchased from Nu-Chek-Prep Inc. (Elysian, MN); CHAPS, hemin chloride, TMPD, Tris, and heme (bovine hemin chloride) were purchased from Sigma; all other reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific.

The alignment used the percentage scoring method, a gap penalty of 3, K-tuple of 1, and a window size of 5. Differences between hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 were mapped onto the ssvCOX-1 x-ray coordinates using the Insight II (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) molecular graphics package. Residues for mutagenesis were selected based on a visual examination of side chains both in close proximity to the ssvCOX-1 x-ray structure of the inhibitor, flurbiprofen and along the channel reported to be the putative path of inhibitor binding. The coding region of hCOX-2 (16Gierse J.K. Hauser S.D. Creely D.P. Koboldt C. Rangwala S.H. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Biochem.

One pmol of mutant primer (5′-TGAAACCATGAT AGA- AGTTGGAG-3′, Midland Certified Reagent Company, Midland, TX) was annealed to 100 ng of single-stranded template, and mutagenesis was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. One-half of the final mutagenesis reaction was used to transform competent BMH 71–18 mutS cells (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) which were grown overnight in LB broth without ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 50-ml cultures using a Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). 10 ng of mutant plasmid was used to transform competent DH10B cells (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Plasmid DNA was isolated from ampicillin-resistant colonies and screened for the presence of the desired mutation by sequencing with a Prism® Cycle Sequencing Kit and 373 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Human COX-2 inserts containing the desired mutation with no secondary misincorporations were isolated with Qiaex resin (Qiagen, Studio City, CA) and subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector pVL 1393 for expression in SF-9 insect cells. Plasmid DNA containing the gene of interest was prepared by alkaline lysis of bacterial cultures and purified over a Qiagen column as described by the manufacturer. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by transfecting 5 µg of plasmid DNA with 400 ng of linearized baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) using the calcium phosphate procedure. Using the linearized DNA, the transfection mixture yields 99.0% or more recombinants. A stock of the recombinant baculoviruses was made from the transfection supernatant. Cells in a 1-liter spinner flask were grown to 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-containing medium (IPL41, tryptose phosphate, 10% fetal bovine serum) and infected with COX recombinant baculoviruses inoculum at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 at 27°C. The cells were harvested at 4 days postinfection by centrifugation at 3,000 × g. The purification has been described previously (16Gierse J.K. Hauser S.D. Creely D.P. Koboldt C. Rangwala S.H. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and is summarized here. 4–6 g of wet weight cells were homogenized in 10 volumes of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25 M sucrose. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g and resuspension in the same buffer, CHAPS detergent was added to 1% (w/v). The supernatant was removed following a 50,000 × g centrifugation and loaded directly onto a 5-ml anion exchange column (Macro-Prep High Q; Bio-Rad), equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.4% CHAPS, pH 8.1. COX enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing salt concentration to 0.3 M. The pool was concentrated 10× with a stirred cell (Amicon, Beverly, MA) YM-30 membrane to 1 ml and loaded onto a 25-ml Superose-12 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS, pH 8.1, and eluted with the identical buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Pools were aliquoted and stored at −80°C for further use. Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) was determined by measuring the turnover of TMPD used in a spectrophotometric assay. Arachidonic acid was used, as a hydroperoxide source, along with the peroxidase substrate N,N,N′N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) as a cosubstrate (10Raz A. Wyche A. Siegel N. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3022-3028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors were incubated for 1 min with purified enzyme in 1 µM heme, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The reaction was started by addition of 100 µM arachidonic acid, 170 µM TMPD and measured by a change in absorbance at 611 nm. Either the initial rate (linear for approximately 10 s) was measured or time points at 1 and 5 min were taken. Time-dependent inactivation curves were made by incubating 10 µM inhibitor with enzyme for 5 s to 2 min. Inhibitory profiles were also assessed by PGE2 determination. Inhibitors (0.001-100 µM) were preincubated with enzyme for 20 min in 50 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, 1 µM heme, 0.01% phenol, 0.3 mM epinephrine. Following a 10-min incubation of arachidonic acid, PGE2 formed as a function of the COX activity was detected by ELISA (Caymen, Ann Arbor, MI). COX-1 and −2 are 63% identical and 77% similar at the amino acid level. A cursory look at the sequence alignment of human COX-1 and COX-2 reveals that most of the major differences are in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The catalytic domain (117–587) is highly conserved, with the major residues known to be involved in catalysis or heme binding; Arg-120, His-206, Tyr-385, His-386, and His-388 all conserved, along with the residue which is acetylated by aspirin (Ser-530). Differences that could be responsible for selectivity are most likely found in the cyclooxygenase active site rather than the peroxidase site, due to the fact that the known selective inhibitors, as do most common NSAIDs, inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity and not the peroxidase activity. With the availability of the ram COX-1 structure, a better view of the cyclooxygenase active site is now available. The residues of COX-2 were overlaid onto the COX-1 structure. The subsequent alignment revealed a number of amino acid differences at the mouth of the cyclooxygenase substrate channel, where a series of amino acids on three α-helixes surrounding the mouth of the channel that have residue changes at approximately every turn in the helix (3 amino acids) and are all on the solvent side of the substrate channel (Table I). The first helix contains two changes; threonine 89 to valine 74 and leucine 92 to isoleucine 77. The helix directly on the opposite side of the channel contains three consecutive changes: leucine 112 to isoleucine 98, leucine 115 to tyrosine 101, and valine 119 to serine 105. A third helix located between the previous two contains one change: phenylalanine 357 to leucine 343. The first three changes (89, 92, 112) are rather benign, with nonpolar residues being exchanged for nonpolar residues of about the same size. More significant changes occur at position 115, where a nonpolar leucine is replaced by an uncharged polar tyrosine; 119 where a nonpolar valine is replaced by an uncharged polar serine; and 357 where a nonpolar leucine is replaced by the much larger nonpolar phenylalanine. One difference is observed at the cyclooxygenase active site, where the isoleucine at position 523 in COX-1 is a valine in COX-2.Table I.Significant cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 active site differencesSubstrate channel entranceUpper channelCOX-18992112115119357523Sheep-1InpaSubscripts np = nonpolar and ucp = uncharged polar.LnpLnpLnpVnpLnpInpHuman-1TucpLnpLnpLnpVnpLnpInpCOX-2747798101105343509Human-2VnpInpInpYucpSucpFnpVnpa Subscripts np = nonpolar and ucp = uncharged polar. Open table in a new tab A model of sheep COX-1 indicating the relative position of the differing residues and other residues of importance is shown graphically in Fig. 1. The substrate channel is oriented from top to bottom with heme at the top and residues 112, 115, and 119 at the bottom. A little further up the channel, but slightly below the catalytic site and NSAID binding pocket sits leucine 357, which is a phenylalanine in COX-2. Residues crucial for catalysis (Tyr-385, Arg-120) are found in close contact with flurbiprofen, which is presumed to be bound in the same space as substrate. Serine 530, which is acetylated by aspirin, is shown next to flurbiprofen. The only amino acid difference in the catalytic site, isoleucine 523, is found on the opposite side. Two hCOX-2 mutants were constructed by introducing hCOX-1 amino acids into a selected site(s); the first combined the three significant changes near the mouth of the substrate channel, tyrosine 101 to leucine, serine 105 to leucine, and phenylalanine 343 to leucine; the second is the single amino acid change, valine 509 to Isoleucine found in the active site. Insect cell expression levels of the mutants were similar to wild type without optimization at the 1-liter level. The purification scheme described under “Experimental Procedures” produced approximately 4 mg of protein from 1 liter at 50% purity. All assays were done with enzyme of this purity. Vmax of both mutants appears to be close to wild type hCOX-2 expressed in insect cells (data not shown). Using the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-58125, both wild type hCOX-2 and the triple mutant demonstrated similar inhibition profiles (IC50 = 1 µM). The single V509I mutation increased the IC50 to >100 µM, which looks like COX-1 at >100 µM (Fig. 2). The assay protocol influences the selectivity of the compound for hCOX-2 and the mutants. Wild type hCOX-2 has an IC50 of 1–2 µM with the assay run as an initial rate or as an end point assay at 1 min read time or 5 min read time. The V509I mutant, however, exhibited a much different behavior. At the initial velocities, there is only a slight right shift in the IC50 curve (to 4 µM). At 1 min, the curve is further shifted to >100 µM and, finally, at 5 min, there is no hint of inhibition at 100 µM, looking completely like COX-1 (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Inhibition curves, with variable assay time of the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-58125.

Inhibition of wild type enzyme by 10 µM SC-58125 is time-dependent and is complete by 1 min, with a half-maximal inhibition at 20 s (Fig. 4A). The mutant exhibits time-dependent behavior, as evidenced by a logarithmic decay in activity over time, only there is a distinct decrease in the rate at which the enzyme is inhibited over time, with only 20% inhibition at 2 min. DUP-697 at 0.5 µM shows a very similar profile with half-maximal inhibition at 5 s and maximal inhibition of 20% at 2 min (Fig. 4B). NS-398 at 10 µM exhibited half-maximal inhibition at 10 s with with wild type that increased to 40 s with the mutant (Fig. 4C). Half-maximal inhibition profiles were determined by the prostaglandin ELISA assay, which favors compounds with a time-dependent component, for a wide range of selective COX-2 inhibitors and known NSAIDs (Table II). All selective COX-2 inhibitors tested (SC-58125, SC-236, DUP-697, and NS-398) demonstrated hCOX-1-like activities with the mutant enzyme. The other commonly used NSAIDs, indomethacin, diclofenac, mephanamate, and flurbiprofen, showed no change in selectivity with the mutant. The only compound that did not follow the trend, Naproxen, had no inhibitory effect with the mutant compared to COX-1 and-2.Table IISelective pharmacology of NSAIDsIC50hCOX-1hCOX-2V509I hCOX-2µMIndomethacin0.080.50.56Mefenamate3.612241Diclofenac0.020.010.04Flurbiprofen0.42.72.6Naproxen2188>1000DUP-6970.90.0010.01NS-398>1000.05>100SC-58125>1000.04>100SC-236170.00515 Open table in a new tab With the identification of a second COX isoform, numerous groups have embarked on efforts to identify selective inhibitors of COX-2. Prior to their discovery, the ability to identify selective inhibitors of COX-2 was not obvious as the enzymes utilize the same substrate and have a high degree of sequence homology. Nonetheless, we and others have reported the identification of selective inhibitors of COX-2 (16Gierse J.K. Hauser S.D. Creely D.P. Koboldt C. Rangwala S.H. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 23Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C. Freire J. Chan H. Sigal E. Ramesha C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The mechanism of inhibition of COX-2 has been described as “time-dependent,” involving a tight binding component, while these compounds are reversible inhibitors of COX-1. (17Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This time-dependent component is the apparent basis for selectivity of this new class of COX-2 inhibitors, since these compounds are reversible inhibitors of COX-1. To further understand the molecular basis of this differential inhibition, a series of mutants was evaluated. We observed that a single amino acid change in COX-2 confers a COX-1 inhibitory profile for these COX-2 selective inhibitors. Specifically, the data suggest that the mechanism for selectivity is intimately associated with the removal of a single methyl group at position 523. Therefore, the time-dependent step could possibly be inhibited by the presence of an additional methyl group in the substrate channel. How do these subtle differences in the active site translate to two functionally distinct enzymes? Recombinant COX-1 and −2 demonstrate a similar Km and Vmax for their common substrate, arachidonic acid (23Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C. Freire J. Chan H. Sigal E. Ramesha C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both enzymes appear to reside on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (24Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, their catalytic roles appear to be the same. Therefore, the major differences between these isoenzymes may be a function of the regulatory mechanisms by which the two enzymes are expressed. For instance, COX-2 expression is induced in discrete cell population response to an inflammatory stimulus, while COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissue (9Masferrer J.L. Zweifel B. Manning P.T. Hauser S.D. Leahy K.M. Smith W.G. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3228-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that COX-1 and −2 have different requirements for hydroperoxide activation and that the hydroperoxide environment in the cell may influence the regulation of the enzyme activity (25Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24019-24023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), a mechanism that is distinct from that of all known NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors. Currently, our understanding of COX-2 structure has been deduced from the known COX-1 crystal structure. Given the high degree of homology between the two enzymes, replacement of the COX-2 residues with those predicted from COX-1 may provide a model of a COX-2 active site. Confirmation of the crystal structure of COX-2 will provide the final evidence as to the exact placement of valine 509 in the active site and the relationship of specific inhibitors in the active site of the enzyme."

Oxidatively modified hemoglobin and superoxide dismutase used as purified proteolytic substrates were also selectively degraded by K562 cell lysates, but exposure of these protein substrates to very high hydrogen peroxide concentrations actually decreased their proteolytic susceptibility. Our studies found little or no change in the overall capacity of cells and cell lysates to degrade “foreign” oxidized proteins after treatment of K562 cells with hydrogen peroxide or paraquat, a finding supported by proteasome Western blots and unchanged capacity of cell lysates to degrade the fluorogenic peptide succinyl-leucine-leucine-valine-tyrosine-4-methylcoumarin-7-amide. Six days of daily treatment of K562 cells with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide directed against the initiation codon region of the human proteasome C2 subunit gene dramatically depressed hydrogen peroxide-induced degradation of metabolically radiolabeled intracellular proteins.

In bacteria a number of proteolytic enzymes seem to be responsible for the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins, whereas in rat liver cells and rabbit, human, and bovine erythrocytes and reticulocytes the multicatalytic proteinase complex proteasome is integrally involved in the process. A number of studies have been conducted with cell lysates, cell extracts, and purified proteasome in an attempt to determine the role of proteasome in recognition and degradation of oxidized proteins (2Pacifici R.E. Salo D.C. Lin S.W. Davies K.J.A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1989; 7: 521-536Google Scholar, 3Salo D.C. Pacifici R.E. Lin S.W. Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol.

However, the role of proteasome in the degradation of mildly oxidized proteins in eucaryotic cells has been challenged in recent publications (9Dean R.T. Geiseg S. Davies M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 437-441Google Scholar, 10Matthews W. Tanaka K. Driscoll J. Ichihara A. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2597-2601Google Scholar). Several reports have explored possible roles of ATP-dependent and ATP-independent proteases in the degradation of oxidized proteins during red blood cell maturation (11Rieder R.F. Ibrahim A.

Rapoport S.M. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1987; 46: 565-570Google Scholar). The lack of specific inhibitors has long been a limiting factor in studying the role of proteasome in intracellular protein turnover. Progress has been made with certain synthetic inhibitors (16Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Angliker H. Shaw E. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 601-605Google Scholar, 17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L.

Cardozo C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Michaud C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29860-29866Google Scholar), and recently an apparently highly specific natural inhibitor has been found (20Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Google Scholar). One of the most specific ways to block the proteasome, however, is through the use of an antisense oligonucleotide, as we recently demonstrated in studies of clone 9 rat liver cells (5Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Google Scholar). We undertook the present investigations to test whether human hematopoietic cells are able to degrade oxidized proteins preferentially and how the ATP-independent 20 S protease proteasome is involved in this process. For our studies we selected K562 cells, a well known human hematopoietic cell line that is able to differentiate in culture. K562 cells (chronic myelogenous leukemia, human) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL 243). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were initially seeded at a density of 0.4 × 106 cells/ml and grown for 3 days to a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml before use. For the experiments the cells were seeded into 16 × 125-mm tissue culture tubes (2 ml of cell suspension per flask) without changing the media or cell density in order to perform the necessary washing procedures. Cell washing or media removal were performed by centrifuging the cells at 1500 × g for 10 min and resuspending in the necessary medium. The measurement of degradation of metabolically radiolabeled proteins (5Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Google Scholar, 21Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 485-502Google Scholar) was performed after either a 2-h labeling procedure or a 16-h labeling procedure (followed by a 2-h “cold chase”) in different experiments. During the labeling procedure cells were incubated with a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture in methionine-free minimal essential Eagle's medium. After 2 or 16 h of incubation at 37° C the labeling mixture was removed and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. In the case of the 16-h labeling procedure this was followed by a 2-h incubation in the cell culture medium with an excess of unlabeled methionine/cysteine and a further washing procedure. The 2-h labeling procedure produces mostly “short-lived” proteins, whereas the 16-h labeling procedure is considered to generate predominantly “long-lived” radiolabeled proteins. The degradation of metabolically labeled proteins was quantified following addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid to the cell suspension and scintillation counting the “released” acid-soluble counts in the supernatant after a centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The degradation of radiolabeled “foreign” proteins and the fluoropeptide s-LLVY-MCA 1The abbreviation used is: s-LLVY-MCAsuccinyl-leucine-leucine-valine-tyrosine-4-methylcoumarin-7-amide (a fluoropeptide substrate for proteolysis). was measured after addition of these substrates to unlabeled cell lysates. Cells were washed twice and then lysed by a 1-h incubation in 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. Unlysed cells, membranes, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. succinyl-leucine-leucine-valine-tyrosine-4-methylcoumarin-7-amide (a fluoropeptide substrate for proteolysis). Cells on the third day after seeding were exposed to bolus additions of H2O2 and paraquat. Exposures were performed for 30 min at 37° C in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) using 0.1 times the volume of the original cell suspension. After 30 min, additional cell culture medium was added to bring the cell suspension back to its initial volume. The effect of H2O2 and paraquat on the degradation of metabolically labeled short-lived proteins (i.e. proteins synthesized during 2 h of radiolabeling) is reported in Fig. 1. After treatment of the K562 cells with 0.4 mM H2O2 we found an increase in release of acid-soluble counts in comparison to the control (Fig. 1A). After 24 h the acid-soluble counts were twice the level of the control. However, an increase of the H2O2 concentration to 1.0 mM was not accompanied by an further increase in acid-soluble counts but instead caused a slight decrease. We next tested the effects of the superoxide-generating agent paraquat (Fig. 1B). Cells were treated with paraquat at two different concentrations, 20 and 300 µM. Both concentrations increased the release of acid-soluble counts by about 30% at the 24-h time point (Fig. 1B). The effect of these two oxidative stresses on the degradation of a longer-lived fraction of cell proteins was tested after labeling the cells for 16 h (followed by a 2-h cold chase) as shown in Fig. 2. Both concentrations of H2O2 used in the experiments showed similar effects on the degradation of long-lived proteins (Fig. 2A) as were seen in the experiments with short-lived proteins (Fig. 1), except that no biphasic proteolytic responses were seen with the long-lived protein pool. The effect of the superoxide-generating agent paraquat on long-lived protein (Fig. 2B) was also similar to its effects on short-lived proteins (Fig. 1). Proteolysis after cell treatment with 300 µM paraquat was decreased in comparison to treatment with 20 µM paraquat but was still higher than proteolysis in the control cells (Fig. 2B). To further explain the results shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 we added oxidatively damaged tritiated hemoglobin as an exogenous substrate to lysates of K562 cells. The tritiated hemoglobin was oxidized with different concentrations of H2O2 prior to incubation with K562 cell lysates to test whether there is an optimum H2O2 treatment for proteolytic susceptibility. Whereas untreated hemoglobin was a poor substrate for proteolysis in K562 cell lysates, increasing H2O2 treatments up to 20 mM H2O2 caused a progressive increase in proteolytic susceptibility (Fig. 3). Hydrogen peroxide concentrations over 20 mM caused more extensive hemoglobin damage, as described previously (22Davies K.J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 346-353Google Scholar), but actually decreased proteolytic susceptibility. Our explanation of this finding is that mildly oxidatively damaged proteins are susceptible to degradation, whereas extremely damaged proteins form cross-links and aggregates that are poor substrates for proteolysis (1Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9895-9901Google Scholar, 2Pacifici R.E. Salo D.C. Lin S.W. Davies K.J.A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1989; 7: 521-536Google Scholar, 3Salo D.C. Pacifici R.E. Lin S.W.

Trans. 1993; 21: 346-353Google Scholar). To test whether protein degradation depends on increased proteolytic susceptibility of substrates or on protease induction or activation, we harvested cells after various time intervals of oxidative stress (H2O2 or paraquat), lysed the cells, and measured the ability of these cell lysates to degrade foreign hemoglobin. The results of these measurements are shown in Fig. 4. Oxidized hemoglobin was degraded up to four times faster by cell lysates than was unmodified hemoglobin. This was true for lysates from control cells, hydrogen peroxide-treated cells, and paraquat-treated cells. There were no time-dependent changes in the ability of the K562 cell lysates to degrade unmodified or control hemoglobin after oxidant treatment of the cells. Thus, protease induction/activation does not appear to be a significant contributor to overall proteolysis, which rather appears to depend on substrate modification. Previous work in red blood cells demonstrated that the 20 S proteasome is responsible for about 70% of the increased proteolysis observed with H2O2 exposure, and our recent studies indicated a similarly important role for proteasome in cultured rat liver cells (5Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Google Scholar). The fluoropeptide s-LLVY-MCA is widely used as a preferential substrate for the 20 S proteasome. To test the possible importance of proteasome in degrading oxidatively modified proteins in K562 cells, we examined the ability of K562 cell lysates to degrade this fluoropeptide after oxidative treatment of the cells (Fig. 5). While we did observe in all cells a 10–15% decrease in proteolysis during the first 5 h, followed by a 30–35% increase in comparison with initial degradation rates, there were no observable H2O2 (Fig. 5A) or paraquat (Fig. 5B) effects. While we cannot explain these small changes in activity, it is important to note that they were limited to the s-LLVY-MCA peptidase activity of the lysates and not the activity against intact proteins. We decided to further test whether there is a real induction of the proteasome using an immunoblot as indicator. The antibody used to recognize the 20 S proteasome was a purified IgG fraction of an anti-20 S proteasome antiserum. In none of the well known proteasome bands was there significant change in intensity, again indicating that proteasome is not induced in our system (data not shown). To clarify the involvement of the proteasome in the increased degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins we decided to decrease proteasome activity in K562 cells using an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against the initiation codon region of the HC2 subunit of the proteasome. We used six daily treatments of K562 cell suspensions with 1 µmol/liter of either sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. Cell proteins were then metabolically radiolabeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine/cysteine, treated with H2O2, and the release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts was measured after 24 h (Fig. 6). With both control cells and “sense” oligodeoxynucleotide-treated cells we measured an increase in proteolysis after treatment with 0.4 mM H2O2 of about 100%. This increase was almost totally abolished in the case of K562 cells that had been pretreated with the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. To test whether there was a real decrease in the actual cellular proteasome content we performed an immunoblot (Fig. 6, inset) and found a decrease in several subunits of the proteasome. To quantify the effect of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide on proteolytic activity we next measured the degradation of a foreign protein substrate, hemoglobin, in K562 cell lysates. As one can see in Fig. 7A, the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide decreased the degradation of oxidatively damaged hemoglobin by >60%, whereas the sense oligodeoxynucleotide had no effect. There were no significant differences between any of the samples in the degradation of undamaged hemoglobin. The same results were also obtained using either peroxide-treated or untreated superoxide dismutase as a proteolytic substrate (data not shown). In Fig. 7B degradation of the fluoropeptide s-LLVY-MCA is shown. Whereas the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide decreased the proteolytic degradation of the peptide by >60%, the sense oligodeoxynucleotide had no significant effect. One can conclude from these data that proteasome plays a major role in the selective degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins in human K562 cells. Inhibition profiles for the degradation of oxidatively modified hemoglobin by human K562 cell extracts reveal a striking similarity with similar experiments in clone 9 liver cell lysates, erythrocyte lysates, and purified erythrocyte 20 S (670 kDa) core proteasome complex (Table I). These results indicate that, as previously reported for erythrocytes, reticulocytes, and rat liver cells (1Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9895-9901Google Scholar, 2Pacifici R.E. Salo D.C.

Our studies indicate that mild forms of oxidative stress are able to increase the intracellular degradation of both short-lived and long-lived proteins in human K562 cells. Similar findings were previously reported from studies with bacteria, chloroplasts, isolated rat mitochondria, rabbit and human erythrocytes and reticulocytes, rat muscles, and rat liver cells (1Davies K.J.A.

Our antisense studies using an oligodeoxynucleotide directed against the human proteasome C2 subunit indicate that proteasome is the main protease responsible for degradation of oxidized proteins in K562 hematopoietic cells. This is in good agreement with results from red blood cells (1Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9895-9901Google Scholar, 2Pacifici R.E. Salo D.C. Lin S.W. Davies K.J.A.

Trans. 1993; 21: 346-353Google Scholar) provided experimental evidence that the ATP-independent 20 S (670–700 kDa) core proteasome complex is the form that selectively recognizes and degrades oxidatively damaged proteins. The degradation of oxidized proteins in red cell and rat liver cell lysates and by the purified erythrocyte or reticulocyte 20 S proteasome complex are actually inhibited 15–20% by ATP as shown in both the present work and in previous studies (2Pacifici R.E.

This observation, plus the overall inhibitor profile reported in Table I, suggest that the ATP-independent 20 S (670–700 kDa) core proteasome is also largely responsible for the degradation of oxidized proteins in human hematopoietic cells. We also looked for a possible net increase in total proteasome activity or cellular content, since oxidative stress might either activate proteasome or induce proteasome synthesis. Our present studies involving comparisons of control and oxidatively stressed cells, however, revealed no evidence to suggest either of these possibilities. By Western blot analyses with polyclonal antiproteasome antibodies and actual proteinase assays measuring cellular capacity to degrade control and oxidatively modified protein substrates such as hemoglobin and superoxide dismutase, no evidence for net increased amounts of proteasome protein or increased total activities were found. Small changes in proteolytic activity toward the fluoropeptide s-LLVY-MCA were not related to oxidation but may be the result of induction or activation of a single 20 S proteasome subunit, which is responsible for degradation of this peptide, as was described for individual yeast proteasome subunits (40Hilt W. Enenkel C. Gruhler A. Singer T. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3479-3486Google Scholar, 41Heinemeyer W. Gruhler A. Mohrle V. Mahe Y. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Google Scholar), or may result from increased activity of another cellular protease. We cannot yet discount the possibility that proteasome activation and/or induction may have occurred but might have been masked by an equal and opposite decline in activity or synthesis or by an increase in proteasome degradation during oxidative stress. Nevertheless, in the absence of any net increase in proteasome activity or content, it seems highly probable that oxidative modification of substrate proteins is the major cause of increased cellular protein degradation following oxidative stress. The role of various proteases in the maturation of red blood cells has been widely studied (11Rieder R.F. Ibrahim A. Etlinger J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2015-2018Google Scholar, 12Fagan J.M.

An important role for lipoxygenase as an initiator of oxidative damage in maturing red cells has been suggested (15Dubiel W. Rapoport S.M. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1987; 46: 565-570Google Scholar). Furthermore, proteasome has been suggested as a candidate for the protease that may recognize lipoxygenase-damaged cellular proteins and initiate their selective degradation. Our current finding that proteasome appears largely responsible for the selective degradation of proteins damaged by oxidation in human erythroid progenitor cells adds credence to the concept that proteasome may perform a similar but more extensive function in the maturation process. Thus our initial studies also appear to validate the use of oligodeoxynucleotides to test this hypothesis."

These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components. Two proteins have been described as constituents of the IL-4 receptor, a ∼140-kDa glycoprotein (IL-4R) and the γ chain (γc) of the IL-2 receptor, but neither of these proteins binds IL-13. We have cloned a cDNA encoding an IL-13 binding protein (IL-13R) from the Caki-1 human renal carcinoma cell line. The cloned cDNA encodes a 380-amino acid protein with two consensus patterns characteristic of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family and a short cytoplasmic tail.

https://openalex.org/W2087612938,"In the present report we have characterized the binding of surfactant protein A (SP-A) to bone marrow-derived macrophages, U937 cells, alveolar macrophages, and type II epithelial cells. The binding of SP-A to all cell types is Ca2+-dependent and trypsin-sensitive, but type II cells express distinct Ca2+-independent binding sites. The binding of SP-A to macrophages is independent of known cell surface carbohydrate-specific receptors and of glycoconjugate binding sites on the surface of the cells and is distinct from binding to C1q receptors. Based on ligand blot analysis, both type II cells and macrophages express a 210-kDa SP-A-binding protein. The 210-kDa protein was purified to apparent homogeneity from U937 macrophage membranes using affinity chromatography with noncovalently immobilized surfactant protein A, and was purified from rat lung by differential detergent and salt extraction of isolated rat lung membranes. Polyclonal antibodies against the rat lung SP-A-binding protein inhibit binding of SP-A to both type II cells and macrophages, indicating that the 210-kDa protein is expressed on the cell surface. The polyclonal antibodies also block the SP-A-mediated inhibition of phospholipid secretion by type II cells, indicating that the 210-kDa protein is a functional cell-surface receptor on type II cells. In a separate report we have determined that antibodies to the SP-A receptor block the SP-A-mediated uptake of Mycobacterium bovis, indicating that the macrophage SP-A receptor is involved in SP-A-mediated clearance of pathogens.

Whitsett J.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). SP-A is also expressed and synthesized in cells of tracheal, bronchial, and tracheobronchial glands indicating that SP-A may be secreted in conducting airways (2Khoor A. Gray M.E. Hull W.M. Whitsett J.A. Stahlman M.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). SP-A is a member of the Ca2+-dependent lectin family of proteins containing an amino-terminal collagen-like domain and a carboxyl-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (3Childs R.A. Wright J.R. Ross G.F. Yuen C-T. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Drickamer K. Feizi T. J. Biol.

SP-A is thought to play an important role in the structural organization, biophysical activity and homeostasis of surfactant lipids, and to interact with alveolar type II epithelial cells and macrophages (4Wright J.R. Borchelt J.D. Hawgood S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5410-5414Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The interaction of SP-A with type II epithelial cells has been associated with inhibition of phospholipid secretion (7Rice W.R. Ross G.F. Singleton F.M. Dingle S. Whitsett J. J. Appl. Phys. 1987; 63: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), involvement in uptake of liposomal phospholipids (8Wright J.R. Wager R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol.

Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L148-L155PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A has also been implicated in lung-specific host defense due to its interaction with a variety of pathogens (11Zimmerman P.E.

Recent studies with recombinant SP-A mutants and domain specific SP-A antibodies show that the CRD domain of SP-A is important in binding to at least one population of receptors on the surface of type II cells (20McCormack F.X.

(6Pison U. Wright J.R. Hagwood S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L412-L417PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that SP-A binds to alveolar macrophages via its collagen-like domain. Malhotra et al.

Med. 1990; 172: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) reported that SP-A interacts with the C1q receptor on U937 macrophage-like cells, again implicating the collagen-like domain of SP-A in this interaction. However, Schlepper-Schaffer and colleagues (24Wintergerst E. Manz-Keinke H. Plattner H. Schlepper-Schafer J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 291-298PubMed Google Scholar, 25Manz-Keinke H. Egenhofer C. Plattner H. Schlepper-Schafer J. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that SP-A bound to monocytes and alveolar macrophages through a mannose-dependent process that may involve the lectin domain of SP-A.In the present work a novel receptor for SP-A was identified on macrophages and rat lung membranes. Polyclonal antibodies to the receptor inhibit SP-A binding to alveolar macrophages and type II cells and block SP-A-mediated inhibition of lipid secretion by type II cells. Our findings suggest that alveolar macrophages and type II cells share an SP-A receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMost reagents were purchased from Sigma. The protease inhibitors Pentafloc SC and (RS)-2-carboxy-3-phenyl propionyl-Leu-OH (CBBL) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA), respectively. N-Hydroxysuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate (Pierce), streptavidin, and HRP-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Pierce. Maltose-Sepharose was prepared as described previously by Townsend and Stahl (26Townsend R. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SP-A, biotinylated as described previously (27Ryan R.M. Morris R.E. Rice W. Ciraolo G. Whitsett J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) at pH 6.3 using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate, was kindly provided by Dr. Gary Ross (Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). C1q was purchased from Calbiochem and was filtered through a 10-ml Sephadex PD-10 column into PBS prior to use. Carrier-free Na125I and the ECL Western blot detection reagent kit were from Amersham Corp.Purification of SP-AHuman SP-A was purified from unfractionated alveolar proteinosis fluid (APF) according to a previously described procedure with some modifications (28Wright J.R. Wager R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APF was delipidated by dropwise addition into 1-butanol (0.5 ml of APF/25 ml of 1-butanol). The insoluble protein was recovered by centrifugation, dried under a constant stream of nitrogen, extracted twice with 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mMβ-D-octylglucoside and extensively dialyzed in 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.02% azide. Soluble SP-A was then recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml and stored at 4°C.Iodination of ProteinsRadioiodination of proteins was performed as described previously using chloramine T (29Shepherd V.L. Konish M.G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 160-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chroneos Z.C. Shepherd V.L. Am J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L721-L726PubMed Google Scholar) except that iodination of SP-A and C1q was carried in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, containing 10 µg of chloramine T and 0.15 mCi of Na125I.Isolation of MacrophagesRat bone marrow-derived macrophages (RBMM) were prepared as described previously (29Shepherd V.L. Konish M.G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 160-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat alveolar macrophages (RAM) were isolated by lung lavage with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were suspended in binding buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mM Hepes, 20 mM TES, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM MgCl2 and 1% BSA). U937 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For isolation of the SP-A receptor, U937 cells were cultured in 175-mm3 flasks to a density of 100 million cells per flask in a volume of 100–150 ml. For studies with surface-labeled cells, U937 cells were iodinated using glucose oxidase-lactoperoxidase as described previously (31Guan E. Burgess W.H. Robinson S.L. Goodman E.B. McTigue K.J. Tenner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20345-20355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was >98%.Isolation of Rat Alveolar Type II Epithelial CellsType II cells were isolated from 200–300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats essentially as described by Dobbs et al. (32Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar) except that type II cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% rat serum for 24 h. To suspend adherent type II cells the plates were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM EDTA and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline-EDTA for 15 min at 4°C. Subsequently, the cells were scraped off the plates, centrifuged, and suspended in binding buffer. Cell viability was >90%.Binding AssaysBinding of radiolabeled proteins to RBMM and U937 cells was performed as described previously (34Shepherd V.L. Abdolrasulnia R. Garrett Cowan H.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar). Binding to alveolar macrophages and type II cells was performed in binding buffer at a concentration of 2.5 to 3.5 million cells/ml in a volume of 0.3 ml. After 1 h on ice the cells were pelleted at 7,000 × g for 5 min, washed once in binding buffer, resuspended in 100-µl aliquots, and counted in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 mM EDTA.Electrophoretic MethodsExcept where indicated, SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions. For all ligand blotting procedures samples were mixed in reducing Laemmli SDS-PAGE buffer and loaded on gels within 30 min. All other samples were boiled for 3–5 min prior to electrophoresis. Fractionated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose by semidry blotting. The anode buffer was composed of 0.3 M Tris, pH 10.4, and 20% methanol. The cathode buffer contained 25 mM Tris, 40 mMε-amino-n-caproic acid, pH 9.4, and 0.1% SDS. Transfers were performed for 40 min at 170 mA for large gels or 100 mA for mini gels.Detection of SP-A Receptor on Nitrocellulose BlotsBlots were initially blocked for 1–2 h at room temperature with TBS-T (25 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.146 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% BSA). All ligand blotting procedures were performed in TBS-T supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2.Immunoligand Blot AnalysisBlots were incubated with unlabeled SP-A at a concentration of 1 µg/ml at 4°C overnight, washed, then probed with rabbit anti-human mannose receptor antibody (1:200) (33Shepherd V.L. Freeze H.H. Miller A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2257-2261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) the membranes were washed and developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine according to standard methods (33Shepherd V.L. Freeze H.H. Miller A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2257-2261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ligand Blot Analysis with bSP-AThis method was initially developed by Dr. Gary Ross (Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). 2G. Ross, unpublished results. The blots were incubated at 4°C overnight with 1.3 µg/ml bSP-A. Blots were then washed three times, 10 min each, with copious amounts of buffer. To detect bound bSP-A the blots were incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated streptavidin at a dilution of 1:50,000 from a stock solution of 1 mg/ml. The blots were washed three times in buffer and developed by chemiluminescence. In some experiments blots were blocked sequentially with streptavidin and D-biotin prior to addition of bSP-A in order to determine the presence of endogenous biotinylated proteins.Ligand Blot Analysis with 125I-SP-ABlots were incubated overnight at 4°C with 1 µg/ml radioactive ligand, washed as described earlier, and exposed to autoradiographic film.Immunoblot AnalysisBlots were probed with rabbit anti-rat lung SP-R210 (described below) at a dilution of 1:3000 in blocking buffer for 1–3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The blots were washed three times for 10 min each with TBS-T and probed with secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:20,000 for 2–4 h at room temperature. The blots were washed with TBS-T, briefly washed with water, and developed using chemiluminescence.Detergent Extraction of CellsCells were pelleted and resuspended in homogenization buffer (HB: 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM o-phenanthroline, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 50 µg/ml bacitracin, 3 µg/ml chymostatin, 10 µg/ml bestatin, 600 µg/ml Pentafloc SC, 20 µM phosphoramidon, 20 µM (RS)-2-carboxy-3-phenylpropionyl-Leu-OH, and 1 mg/ml DNase I) at a ratio of 1 ml/10-20 million cells. After addition of Triton X-100 to 1%, cells were maintained on ice for 30 min and used as whole cell extracts or microcentrifuged for 10 min to separate detergent-insoluble from detergent-soluble membranes.Preparation of SP-A Affinity ColumnPurified SP-A was bound to maltose-Sepharose noncovalently via its CRD. SP-A was dialyzed in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and mixed with maltose-Sepharose resin at a ratio of 0.6 mg of SP-A/ml of packed resin. After mixing, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mM. The supension was rotated for several hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The affinity column was washed to remove unbound material, resuspended in binding buffer and stored in the cold until used. Greater than 95% of added SP-A bound to the maltose-Sepharose.Isolation of SP-A Receptor from U937 CellsAll subsequent steps were performed at 0–4°C. U937 cells were washed once in RPMI and resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM o-phenanthroline, 10 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml bestatin, 100 µg/ml bacitracin, 20 µM phosphoramidon, and 20 µM CBBL (solution A). The cells were left on ice until 75% of cells lysed (20–40 min) and then homogenized with 10 strokes in a Wheaton Ten-Broeck chamber. At this stage, 97% of cells lysed. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 800 × g and a total membrane fraction was collected from the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membranes were resuspended using a plastic Pasteur pipette and allowed to swell in 10 ml of above buffer for a few hours to overnight. The membranes were solubilized for one hour on ice by addition of 20% Triton X-100 to 2% final concentration and adjusted to 0.15 M in NaCl. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Solubilized membranes were rotated overnight with a 1 ml packed volume of gelatin-Sepharose to remove fibronectin and collagenases and then with a 3-ml packed volume of maltose-Sepharose for 6 h in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 to remove maltose-binding lectins. The unadsorbed protein was rotated overnight with a 3-ml packed volume of previously prepared SP-A-maltose-Sepharose. Unbound protein was eluted and the resin washed with 10 volumes of solution A containing 2% Triton X-100. The resin was then washed with 5 volumes of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 60 mM octylglucoside, 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and protease inhibitors (solution B). The SP-R210 was then eluted in solution B adjusted to 0.25 mM in EGTA, 0.5 M in NaCl and pH 6.5. The SP-R210 fraction was dialyzed against 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM octylglucoside, 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM o-phenanthroline, and concentrated to 1.5 ml by osmosis against polyethylene glycol 20,000.Partial Purification of SP-A Receptor from Rat Lung Membranes and Development of Polyclonal AntibodiesRat lungs were perfused via the pulmonary artery with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM EGTA. The lungs were isolated and intratracheally instilled with 10–15 ml of ice-cold DNase I-free HB buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose. In all subsequent steps, HB buffer was used free of DNase I. The tracheas were then tied with surgical suture, and the lungs were placed on ice until homogenization. All subsequent steps were performed at 0–4°C. The lungs were cleared of extraneous tissue and homogenized in a Tekmar tissue homogenizer (3 × 20 s, two-thirds of maximum speed) using 25 ml of HB/lung. The homogenate was filtered over two layers of gauze and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 25 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 2.5 h over a cushion of 50% sucrose. The membrane pellet was washed once in 50 ml of HB buffer, resuspended in 15 ml of HB without sucrose and allowed to swell for several hours to overnight. Lung membranes at a concentration of 3.5 mg/ml were solubilized on ice for 15 min by addition of 25% Triton X-100 to 1% final concentration, and Triton-insoluble membranes were collected by centrifugation at 45,000 × g over a cushion of 50% sucrose for 1 h. The insoluble fraction was further enriched in SP-A receptor by dilution to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in the presence of 1 M KCl and 1% Triton X-100. This treatment removed peripheral membrane proteins and membrane-associated myosin. After 15–30 min on ice, the mixture was centrifuged for 1.5 h at 45,000 × g over a layer of HB containing 50% in sucrose. The pellet that passed through the sucrose layer containing the SP-R210-enriched fraction was resuspended in 3 ml of sucrose-free HB. To obtain polyclonal antibodies, the SP-R210 enriched extract was further purified by SDS-PAGE and its position identified by ligand blot analysis with bSP-A. The SP-R210 band was excised from the polyacrylamide gel and injected into rabbits in incomplete Freund's adjuvant according to standard protocols. The rabbit was boosted with antigen twice at 2 and 8 weeks after the initial injection.Other MethodsMethods for immunoprecipitation, phosphatidylcholine secretion, and collagenase digestion were performed as described previously (34Shepherd V.L.

Protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay with BSA as the protein standard.DISCUSSIONThe ability of SP-A to alter the function of macrophages and type II cells suggests that these cells express specific cell-surface SP-A receptors. Using in vitro binding assays and ligand blot analysis we identified a distinct 210-kDa membrane protein (SP-R210) on macrophages, type II cells and isolated rat lung membranes. The SP-R210 was purified to apparent homogeneity from U937 macrophage membranes and rat lung membranes. Polyclonal antibodies against the rat lung SP-R210 inhibited the Ca2+-dependent binding of SP-A to type II cells and macrophages indicating that SP-R210 is expressed on the cell-surface. The ability of antibodies against SP-R210 to inhibit SP-A function demonstrate that SP-R210 is a cell-surface receptor involved in the SP-A-mediated regulation of surfactant homeostasis and phagocytosis of pathogens.The mechanism of SP-A binding to cells is not completely understood. In the present work we were able to purify the SP-A receptor from macrophages using SP-A immobilized via its carbohydrate binding site. Furthermore, we could detect the purified receptor by immunoligand blotting using SP-A and antibodies specific to the CRD domain of SP-A (Fig. 6) suggesting that domains other than the carbohydrate binding site of SP-A are important for binding to the receptor. In agreement with previous findings (18Manz-Keinke H. Plattner H. Schlepper-Schafer J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 95-100PubMed Google Scholar), we also observed that collagen V inhibited SP-A binding to macrophages suggesting that the collagen-like domain is involved in SP-A binding (not shown). We also determined that carbohydrate-specific receptors were not involved in SP-A binding (Fig. 3) to macrophages. In agreement with our conclusions, earlier findings (28Wright J.R. Wager R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Using glycosylation-deficient mutants McCormack et al. (20McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P.A. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed that SP-A glycosylation is not required in cell binding. Recombinant rat SP-A deficient in the hydroxylation of prolines oligomerized to a lesser extend than native SP-A and had a significantly reduced ability to compete with native SP-A in binding to type II cell membranes, to inhibit phospholipid secretion and to aggregate liposomes (20McCormack F.X.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the intact collagen-like domain participates in SP-A function. Using epitope mapping analysis with monoclonal antibodies, Kuroki et al. (21Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined that the ability of SP-A to inhibit phospholipid secretion by type II cells resided in the CRD domain of SP-A. In contrast to earlier conclusions that the CRD binding site is not involved in SP-A binding, however, mutation of Glu195 and Arg197 to Gln195 and Asp197 in the CRD binding site of hydroxyproline-deficient SP-A converted SP-A to a galactose-specific lectin with lower affinity for type II cells and decreased ability to inhibit phospholipid secretion (51McCormack F.X.

Cell Res. 1991; 192: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) found that binding of recombinant SP-A to macrophages was partially mannose-dependent. The recombinant SP-A used in their studies was generated in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a vector containing the α3 gene of SP-A (24Wintergerst E. Manz-Keinke H. Plattner H. Schlepper-Schafer J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 291-298PubMed Google Scholar, 25Manz-Keinke H. Egenhofer C. Plattner H. Schlepper-Schafer J. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that was shown to form only partial SP-A oligomers and was inefficient in enhancing phagocytosis of bacteria compared to purified human alveolar proteinosis SP-A. Interestingly, the recombinant SP-A generated using both α2 and α3 SP-A genes partially restored the ability of SP-A to direct phagocytosis of bacteria (18Manz-Keinke H. Plattner H. Schlepper-Schafer J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 95-100PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the state of SP-A aggregation may be an important determinant in regulating the mechanism of SP-A binding to cells. In addition, binding of SP-A is Ca2+-dependent. Additional characterization of mutant SP-A molecules with respect to these parameters will further the understanding of SP-A binding to cells.The novel SP-A receptor that we have charac"

https://openalex.org/W2168076633,"We provide evidence that phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) formed during signaling in plants is metabolized by a novel pathway. In much of this study, 32Pi-labeled Chlamydomonas cells were used, and signaling was activated by adding the G-protein activator mastoparan. Within seconds of activation, large amounts of [32P]PtdOH were formed, with peak production at about 4 min, when the level was 5–25-fold higher than the control. As the level of [32P]PtdOH subsequently decreased, an unknown phospholipid (PLX) increased in radiolabeling; before activation it was barely detectable. The chromatographic properties of PLX resembled those of lyso-PtdOH and CMP·PtdOH but on close inspection were found to be different. PLX was shown to be diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP), the product of a newly discovered enzyme, phosphatidate kinase, whose in vitro activity was described recently (Wissing, J. B., and Behrbohm, H. (1993) Plant Physiol. 102, 1243-1249). The identity of DGPP was established by co-chromatrography with a standard and by degradation analysis as follows: [32P]DGPP was deacylated, and the product (glycerolpyrophosphate, GroPP) was hydrolyzed by mild acid treatment or pyrophosphatase to produce GroP and Pi as the only radioactive products. Since DGPP is the pyrophosphate derivative of PtdOH and is formed as the concentration of PtdOH decreases, we assumed that PtdOH was converted in vivo to DGPP. This was confirmed by showing that during a short labeling protocol while the specific radioactivity of DGPP was increasing, the specific radioactivity of the 32Pi derived from DGPP as above was higher than that of [32P]GroP. DGPP was also formed in suspension cultures of tomato and potato cells, and its synthesis was activated by mastoparan. Moreover, it was also found in intact tissues of a number of higher plants, for example, carnation flower petals, vetch roots, leaves of fig-leaved goosefoot, and common persicaria and microspores of rape seed. Our results suggest that DGPP is a common but minor plant lipid that increases in concentration when signaling is activated.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). Individual PKC isoenzymes are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner. In addition, PKC isoenzymes have slightly different activator requirements in vitro and undergo differential translocation and down-regulation in response to phorbol esters in vivo. These studies have suggested that PKC isoenzymes mediate distinct functions in vivo; however, as of yet, the nature of these specific functions or the mechanisms resulting in the selective regulation of individual isoenzymes have not been determined. protein kinase C sn-1,2-phosphatidylserine sn-1,2-diacylglycerol phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate actin binding site. To establish distinct functions for PKC isoenzymes, we examined the PKC βI and βII isoenzymes. PKC βI and βII are the two closest related PKC isoenzymes with 96% identity at the amino acid level. They are identical for the first 621 amino acids and differ only over their carboxyl-terminal 50–52 amino acids, where they are 45% homologous (Fig. 1). Significantly, this divergence has been precisely conserved over evolution with species as diverse as rat, rabbit, and human having identical PKC βI- and βII-specific amino acid sequences. In addition, among the PKC genes, the PKC β gene and its gene products, PKC βI and βII, are subject to the most extensive regulation with both tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression (2Yoshida Y. Huang F.L. Nakabayshi H. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9868-9873Google Scholar) as well as evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation (3Blobe G.C. Khan W.A. Halpern A.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10627-10635Google Scholar). We have reasoned that this extensive regulation and the evolutionary conservation of both the divergent sequences and the mechanisms for regulating their differential expression underscore the distinct functions mediated by these isoenzymes. Moreover, the well defined structural differences between these two isoenzymes may allow definitive delineation of unique structural motifs underlying the mechanism of isoenzyme-specific functions. Here we demonstrate that while PKC βI and βII display identical enzymatic activity in vitro, they behave as unique isoenzymes with distinct properties in vitro and in vivo. PKC βII is defined as an actin-binding protein that translocates to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Once translocated, PKC βII becomes activated and resistant to down-regulation allowing for prolonged activation of PKC βII in vivo. In addition, actin-bound PKC βII exhibits an altered substrate specificity. By establishing sequence-specific functions for PKC βII, these studies define a molecular basis for PKC isoenzyme-specific function and identify a new functional domain in PKC responsible for isoenzyme-specific protein-protein interaction and isoenzyme-specific function in vivo.

Autophosphorylation reactions were performed in the absence of substrate. Other PKC substrates were used at a concentration of 100 µg/ml. Assay contents were varied as depicted in the figures. In some cases, F-actin, H-7, or staurosporine were added at the indicated concentrations. Assays were analyzed either directly by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography or by filtering on GF/C filters and scintillation counting. MOLT-4, BJA-B, or K562 cells were treated with either 100 nM PMA or ethanol/Me2SO control for 5 min to 24 h at 37°C and harvested by centrifugation. In some cases, cells were pretreated with either cytochalasin D (10 µM) or with nocodazole (35 ng/ml) for 2 h before treatment with PMA as indicated. For translocation to the membrane and down-regulation, cells were lysed in homogenizing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in Me2SO, 0.2% (w/v) leupeptin) and sonicated on ice. For translocation to the cytoskeleton, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 solubilization buffer (15 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Cytoskeleton and supernatant, cytosol, and membrane were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. Samples were then resuspended and analyzed by Western blot analysis. G-actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle using the procedure of Pardee and Spudich (8Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Google Scholar). The G-actin was stored in G-actin buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol) and was greater than 99% pure as judged by Commassie Blue staining. G-actin was stored as F-actin by polymerization with the addition of 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl to G-actin in G-actin buffer. F-actin (30 µg) was incubated with 100 fmol of baculovirus-expressed partially purified PKC βI and βII isoenzymes in the absence or presence of PKC activators (MgATP, PS/DAG, Ca2+) as indicated for 1–5 min in a total volume of 50 µl. In some cases 10–500 µM peptide or troponin complex was added before the addition of PKC βI or βII as indicated. The F-actin was sedimented at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 50 µl of G-actin buffer for 1 h at 4°C, and then both the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) were analyzed by Western blot analysis. In some experiments, duplicates were run and Commassie Blue stained to confirm that all of the F-actin was sedimented in the pellet and that nonspecific proteins such as bovine serum albumin remained in the supernatant under the conditions of these studies. Treated or untreated cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 6–8 h and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50 µg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 1:100 dilution in RIPA lysis buffer for 2–24 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were harvested by centrifugation and washed 4 times with RIPA lysis buffer to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacyrlamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography and/or Western blot analysis. Extracts were obtained from cell lines by direct lysis in 2 × sample buffer (10% glycerol, 2.0% SDS, 0.3%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 0.25 × upper Tris (pH 6.8, 10% SDS), or by suspending cells in ice-cold homogenizing buffer at 107 cells/ml and lysing by sonication. Samples were run on 7.5%-10% SDS-polyacyrlamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose at 4°C overnight. Western blots were then performed as described previously (6Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 658-664Google Scholar). In certain cases an ECL system (Amersham Corp.) was used for detection. The basic properties of PKC βI and βII isoenzymes have been evaluated previously in isoenzymes expressed in COS cells (9Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Google Scholar). These studies concluded that PKC βI and βII displayed similar requirements for cofactors. To evaluate for functional differences between the PKC βI and βII isoenzymes, biochemical characterization of the partially purified PKC βI and βII isoenzymes was performed. These isoenzymes were expressed in the baculovirus expression system as described previously (10Stabel S. Schaap D. Parker P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 670-673Google Scholar), and their identity and purity have been confirmed previously by Western blot analysis (6Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 658-664Google Scholar). PKC βI and βII exhibited identical dependences and requirements for PS, DAG, oleic acid, Mg2+, and ATP (Fig. 2); they phosphorylated a number of in vitro substrates including histone IIIS and myelin basic protein in an identical manner (Fig. 2), and they were inhibited to a similar extent by both regulatory domain (sphingosine) and catalytic domain (staurosporine) inhibitors of PKC (Fig. 2). Examining the sequences of PKC βI and βII reveals that they are identical over the C1 domain, responsible for interaction with PS, DAG, phorbol esters, and sphingosine; identical over the C2 domain, responsible for interaction with calcium; identical over the C3 domain, responsible for interaction with ATP and staurosporine; and identical over the C4 domain, responsible for the interaction with substrates (Fig. 1). Therefore, the finding that PKC βI and βII isoenzymes are quite similar in the in vitro biochemical properties defined by these domains is predictable. The results obtained with baculovirus-expressed PKC βI and βII isoenzymes were also consistent with assays done with a mixture of PKC βI and βII isolated from natural sources such as rat brain (11Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2962-2972Google Scholar), suggesting that these baculovirus-expressed PKC isoenzymes were produced in a fully functional manner. Moreover, the identical enzymatic properties of these two proteins make it unlikely that any subsequent differences in function identified would be due to differences in their expression or purification. Finally, these data demonstrate that current biochemical assays for PKC isoenzymes are not adequate for defining isoenzyme-specific differences, underscoring the need for more sophisticated isoenzyme-specific assays. The in vitro biochemical properties of PKC examined thus far are determined by the domains that are identical in PKC βI and PKC βII. Therefore, we resorted to cellular studies that may provide insight into isoenzyme-specific function based on the isoenzyme-specific domains. Two in vivo properties of PKC, translocation to the membrane and to the cytoskeleton as well as down-regulation in response to phorbol ester treatment were evaluated. In several cell lines that express detectable levels of PKC βI and βII (the T-lymphoblastoid cell line, MOLT-4, the erythroleukemia cell line, K562, and the B-lymphoblastoid cell line, BJA-B), treatment with PMA caused both PKC βI and βII to translocate to the membrane and to undergo down-regulation with similar kinetics (Fig. 3A). However, only PKC βII translocated to the cytoskeleton (Fig. 3B). PKC βI could not be detected in the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 3B) even when exposure was carried out for 5 times the duration or when 10-fold excess protein was loaded (data not shown). Translocation of PKC βII to the cytoskeleton occurred as early as 5 min (Fig. 3C). Once translocated to the cytoskeleton, PKC βII was relatively resistant to down-regulation for prolonged periods of time, up to 24 h, as opposed to down-regulation by 2 h after translocation to the membrane (Fig. 3, A and C). The mechanism of this protection is unknown, but it may involve “sequestration” of PKC βII in a compartment not readily available to proteases. These results identify cytoskeletal association as a cellular activity specific to PKC βII but not PKC βI. To establish the cytoskeletal elements with which PKC βII was associating, cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D, to disrupt the microfilament-based cytoskeleton, or nocodazole, to disrupt the microtubule-based cytoskeleton. The translocation of PKC βII to the cytoskeleton was then examined. Cytochalasin D was able to inhibit translocation of PKC βII to the cytoskeleton; however, nocodazole treatment was ineffective (Fig. 4). Importantly, neither treatment was able to inhibit translocation of PKC βI (data not shown) or βII to the membrane (Fig. 4), demonstrating the specificity of the effects of these reagents. These studies suggested that translocation of PKC βII to the cytoskeleton was specifically mediated by the microfilament-based cytoskeleton. To identify potential proteins that could target PKC βII to the microfilament-based cytoskeleton, MOLT-4 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and PKC βI and βII were immunoprecipitated from control and PMA-stimulated cells. Although PKC βI and βII could not be directly detected by [35S]methionine labeling in MOLT-4 cells (due to their long half-life, low methionine content, and low cellular content of the protein), both PKC βI and βII were detected in the immunoprecipitates by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). PKC βII antiserum was also able to co-immunoprecipitate a 40-kDa protein in MOLT-4 cells, and the association of PKC βII with this 40-kDa protein was increased with phorbol ester stimulation (Fig. 5B). In contrast, neither the PKC βII preimmune serum nor the PKC βI antibody was able to co-immunoprecipitate any proteins in this range in either control or PMA stimulated cells (Fig. 5B). The ability of cytochalasin D to specifically inhibit the translocation of PKC βII to the cytoskeleton and the ability of PKC βII antiserum to specifically co-immunoprecipitate a 40-kDa protein both suggested that this 40-kDa protein was actin. Indeed, the 40-kDa protein was detected by anti-actin antibody (Fig. 5C). In addition, immunoprecipitation with anti-actin antibody resulted in a single band of approximately 40 kDa, which co-migrated with the 40-kDa protein co-immunoprecipitated with PKC βII and which was also identified by anti-actin antibody by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C), confirming the 40-kDa protein as actin. No actin was identified in PKC βI antiserum or PKC βII preimmune serum immunoprecipitates. Therefore, specific translocation of PKC βII to the microfilament-based cytoskeleton appears to be mediated by direct binding of PKC βII to actin, suggesting that the PKC βII-specific carboxyl sequence is necessary for this interaction. The molecular basis and mechanism of PKC βII binding to actin was investigated by examining the interaction of PKC βII and actin in vitro using purified actin (G- and F-actin) and baculovirus-expressed PKC βI and βII isoenzymes. Gel filtration of autophosphorylated PKC βII in the presence or absence of G-actin did not alter the elution profile of PKC βII or result in the formation of any higher molecular weight complexes demonstrating that PKC βII does not interact with G-actin (data not shown). In the absence of any PKC activators or cofactors, neither PKC βI or βII co-sedimented with F-actin (Fig. 6A). With the addition of calcium, PS, DAG, and MgATP, both PKC βI and βII precipitated in this assay, independent of the presence of actin (Fig. 6A). This is most likely a result of aggregation of PKC with lipids (11Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2962-2972Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). However, by increasing the concentration of magnesium in the assay from 0.2 to 1 mM, PKC βII bound to F-actin specifically in the absence of any lipid cofactors. In contrast, concentrations of 0.2 to 100 mM magnesium did not promote PKC βI binding (Fig. 6B). Having recapitulated the in vivo specificity of PKC βII binding to F-actin in vitro, the F-actin co-sedimentation assay was used to establish the molecular basis of the selective interaction of PKC βII with F-actin. Analysis of the divergent sequence of PKC βII (amino acids 622–673) revealed that there were two regions highly homologous to actin binding sites (ABS) of previously characterized actin binding proteins (underlined in Fig. 1). An amino-terminal site was homologous to the ABS of troponin I (ABS-1). The carboxyl-terminal ABS was homologous to a consensus ABS found in several actin-binding proteins including myosin heavy chain and α-actin (ABS-2). Significantly, these regions are not conserved in PKC βI. Therefore, we reasoned that they could represent the ABS of PKC βII. To determine whether either or both of these regions was responsible for mediating PKC βII binding to F-actin, peptides were synthesized to the entire divergent region of PKC βII including these two motifs and to the divergent region of PKC βI as well (Fig. 1). The ability of these peptides to compete off binding of PKC βII to actin was then assayed using the F-actin co-sedimentation assay (Fig. 7, A and B). Of the three peptides to PKC βII, only peptide 1 containing the majority of ABS-1 was effective (IC50 = 70 µM), while peptide 2, containing the carboxyl-terminal portion of ABS-1, was modestly effective (IC50 = 250 µM). On the other hand, neither peptide 3 to PKC βII (which contained all of ABS-2) nor any of the peptides to PKC βI (peptides 5–7) were active in this regard (Fig. 7, A and B). These results suggested that ABS-1 was responsible for mediating the interaction of PKC βII with actin. To evaluate this hypothesis further, the combination of peptides 1 and 2, as well as an additional peptide, peptide 4, which contains the entire ABS-1, were tested in the competition assay. These peptides were much more effective in competing off PKC βII binding (IC50 = 5–10 µM). In addition, as ABS-1 is homologous to the ABS of troponin I, we examined whether troponin I could compete off PKC βII binding. Indeed, exogenously added troponin complex was even more potent (IC50 = 2 µM), demonstrating that the selective binding of PKC βII to actin in vitro is mediated through ABS-1, which PKC βII contains in its unique diverged sequence (Fig. 7A). The F-actin co-sedimentation assay was then used to determine the mechanism of selective interaction of PKC βII with F-actin. Since stimulation of PKC by phorbol esters was required for translocation of PKC βII to the cytoskeleton and for efficient association with F-actin in vivo, we hypothesized that in the presence of 1 mM magnesium and F-actin, PKC βII was specifically activated to allow association with actin to occur in vitro. To evaluate this possibility, PKC activity was monitored in the presence and absence of F-actin under conditions of the F-actin co-sedimentation assay. PKC βII was maximally autophosphorylated in the presence of F-actin under actin-binding conditions and in the absence of any additional cofactors or activators (Fig. 8A). This level of autophosphorylation of PKC βII was similar to that observed in the presence of its “classical” activators (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, PKC βI underwent significant autophosphorylation only in the presence of activators, with much less autophosphorylation in the presence of actin and Mg2+ (Fig. 8A). This latter effect could represent either nonspecific effects of actin or a much weaker interaction of actin and PKC βI. Next, the association of autophosphorylated PKC βII with actin was investigated. All autophosphorylated PKC βII was bound to F-actin in the F-actin co-sedimentation assay (Fig. 8B). Since the F-actin buffer contains ATP, PKC βII may become autophosphorylated (and possibly activated) first and then binds actin. Therefore, to determine whether autophosphorylation/activation of PKC βII was required for F-actin binding or a consequence of this interaction, the F-actin co-sedimentation assay was performed in the presence of catalytic inhibitors of PKC, H-7 and staurosporine. These inhibitors, even when used at 160-7000-fold their Ki failed to inhibit F-actin binding by PKC βII (Fig. 9A); however, they were able to inhibit the activation of PKC βII once bound to F-actin as measured by inhibition of PKC βII autophosphorylation (Fig. 9B) and histone III-S phosphorylation (data not shown). These data suggest that activation of PKC βII is not required for F-actin binding but that once bound, PKC βII becomes activated. This may represent an important mechanism for the long-term activation of PKC βII in vivo, since cytoskeletal PKC βII is partially protected from down regulation. PKC phosphorylates many cytoskeletal-associated proteins in vitro including adducin (12Waseem A. Palfrey H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 563-573Google Scholar), myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (13Graff J.M. Gordon J.I. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1989; 246: 503-506Google Scholar, 14Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Google Scholar), troponin (15Noland Jr., T.A. Kuo J.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 123-129Google Scholar), and vimentin (16Inagaki M. Nishi Y. Nishizawa K. Matsushi M. Sato C. Nature. 1987; 328: 649-652Google Scholar). As PKC βII translocating to the cytoskeleton was activated and resistant to down-regulation, we examined the ability of F-actin-associated PKC βII to phosphorylate actin and other cytoskeletal proteins. Actin was phosphorylated by PKC βII with a 5-fold increase in phosphorylation compared with PKC βI, which was unable to phosphorylate actin over basal levels under any conditions (Fig. 10). These studies demonstrate that actin is a selective substrate for PKC βII. However, it should be noted that F-actin was a poor substrate for PKC βII with substoichiometric phosphorylation, suggesting that the observed phosphorylation reflects the intimate association of F-actin with activated PKC βII rather than actin serving as a physiological substrate. Next, we investigated whether PKC βII bound to F-actin could alter the substrate specificity of PKC βII. The presence of increasing amounts of F-actin under binding conditions was able to specifically inhibit the phosphorylation of histone IIIS by PKC βII in vitro, with 50% inhibition relative to PKC βI phosphorylation (Fig. 10). Importantly, F-actin under nonbinding conditions or G-actin were ineffective in this regard, and F-actin under binding conditions had no effect on PKC βI activity, demonstrating that alterations were due to changes in the substrate specificity of PKC βII once bound to F-actin. These studies suggested that binding to F-actin could selectively alter PKC βII substrate specificity. To investigate the role of F-actin in modulating PKC-substrate interactions further, other well characterized substrates for PKC were evaluated in this assay. All of these substrates were phosphorylated by PKC βI and βII in a stoichiometric fashion (data not shown). However, as with histone IIIS, the ability of PKC βII to phosphorylate vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, was also potently inhibited by increasing F-actin concentration under binding conditions, with 58% inhibition (Fig. 10). Evaluation of other in vitro substrates such as myelin basic protein and protamine sulfate or in vivo substrates such as myosin light chain, troponin, and adducin revealed that none of these phosphorylations by PKC βII or βI were influenced by the presence of F-actin, suggesting that the F-actin effect on PKC βII is substrate-specific (Fig. 10 and data not shown). In addition, the presence of F-actin, under binding conditions, was able to selectively and potently enhance the ability of PKC βII to use itself as a substrate (autophosphorylation), with 5-fold stimulation relative to PKC βI (Fig. 10). These results strongly suggest that the selective binding of PKC βII to F-actin not only activates PKC βII and renders it resistant to down-regulation, but it also alters its substrate specificity allowing isoenzyme-specific phosphorylation and functions to occur in vivo. This study has determined specific functions for the PKC βII isoenzyme based on its unique carboxyl-terminal tail. PKC βII can be distinguished from PKC βI through its interaction with F-actin mediated by ABS-1 as established by 1) the ability of PKC βII (and not PKC βI) to selectively translocate to the cytoskeleton, 2) the ability of cytochalasin D to selectively block association of PKC βII with the cytoskeleton, 3) the ability of PKC βII antibody (and not PKC βI antibody) to co-immunoprecipitate actin, 4) the ability of PKC βII (and not PKC βI) to selectively bind to F-actin in vitro, 5) the ability of PKC βII peptides (and not PKC βI peptides) to selectively block the binding of PKC βII to F-actin in vitro, 6) the determination of a specific ABS involved in the interaction of PKC βII with actin 7), the ability of F-actin to selectively activate PKC βII (and not PKC βI) in the absence of any cofactors, 8) the ability of PKC βII (and not PKC βI) to selectively phosphorylate F-actin, and 9) the ability of F-actin to selectively alter the substrate specificity of PKC βII (and not PKC βI). In addition, while this study was in progress, the localization of PKC isoenzymes was investigated in NIH-3T3 cells, and it was found that PKC βII, and not PKC βI, co-localized with the cytoskeleton following treatment with PMA (17Goodnight J. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Google Scholar). These immunocytochemical studies support our current in vitro and cellular biochemical findings of specific interactions of PKC βII with actin and the actin cytoskeleton. These studies suggest a novel mechanism for long-term regulation of PKC. Prolonged stimulation of PKC activity, by increasing the steady-state phosphorylation of substrates, has been shown to be essential for such PKC-mediated events as T-lymphocyte activation, maintenance of the multidrug resistance phenotype, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (18Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 411-431Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that PKC activity could be increased long term by either increasing the levels of PKC activators long term or by increasing the expression of the individual PKC isoenzymes. Here we demonstrate that although PKC βII requires a transient signal to translocate to the actin cytoskeleton, once bound, PKC βII becomes activated, and, more importantly, remains relatively resistant to down-regulation so that cellular PKC activity is increased for prolonged periods of time. This suggests that a distinct mechanism for increasing long term PKC activity in the cell derives from tethering a PKC isoenzyme to a discrete subcellular site where it becomes activated, has access to physiological substrates, and is sequestered from the proteases that are normally responsible for its subsequent down-regulation. PKC and specific PKC isoenzymes have been previously linked to many cellular proteins, with cytoskeletal proteins comprising a substantial portion of these proteins. In general two methods have been utilized to screen for proteins with which PKC isoenzymes interact. First, immunohistochemistry techniques have been utilized to define proteins with which PKC colocalizes. In this fashion, the interaction of PKC α with vinculin and talin in focal contacts (19Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Google Scholar), of PKC β with vimentin in intermediate filaments (20Spudich A. Meyer T. Stryer L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 250-256Google Scholar), of PKC β with ankyrin and spectrin in cytoplasmic aggregates (21Gregorio C.C. Repasky E.A. Fowler V.M. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 345-358Google Scholar), and of PKC with myofibrils and microfilaments (22Mochly-Rosen D. Henrich C.J. Cheever L. Khaner H. Simpson P.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 693-706Google Scholar) have been defined. These studies have suggested that the association of PKC with these subcellular elements may be critical to the function of PKC. Second, the protein-protein interactions of PKC have also been defined using the overlay assay. Indeed, these studies have led to the discovery of receptors for activated C-kinase by Mochly-Rosen and co-workers (23Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Google Scholar). The currently isolated RACKs appear to interact via the C2 domain (which PKC βI and βII have in common) and to be important for the translocation of all PKC isoenzymes to the membrane, although the possibility for isoenzyme-specific receptors for activated C-kinase has been proposed. In contrast, Jaken and co-workers (24Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Google Scholar) have used the overlay assay for interaction cloning of proteins associating with PKC, finding that most of these proteins are substrates for PKC such as β-adducin and myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate. In the present studies, immunoprecipitation experiments and protein-protein binding analysis have been utilized to determine proteins with which an individual PKC isoenzyme may interact. We believe that this approach may prove to be useful for identification of additional isoenzyme-specific protein-protein interactions.

The ESR spectra obtained using both spin traps were typical of an immobilized nitroxide and indicated that the adduct was a macromolecule.

Oxidative stress in mitochondria has been the focus of much research in the last several decades. Reports of the production of H2O2 via the incomplete reduction of O2 during oxidative phosphorylation have provided the impetus for such studies (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, hydrogen peroxide levels are kept relatively low (10−9-10−7M) through the actions of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Google Scholar). However, under certain conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion or inflammation, the production of excessive amounts of hydrogen peroxide does occur (2Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Free Rad. Biol.

This production of excess hydrogen peroxide is thought to precede several events that are characteristic of oxidative stress such as lipid peroxidation, glutathione depletion, calcium imbalance, and DNA and protein damage (3Janssen Y.M.W.

Many researchers have promoted the idea that the oxidative damage caused by hydrogen peroxide is conveyed through its reaction with transition metals, which would involve the Haber-Weiss-type reaction sequence (7Miller D.M. Buettner G.R. Aust S.D. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 95-108Google Scholar). Others have reported that the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with heme proteins, such as cytochrome c, produces highly reactive ferryl-heme species that are capable of oxidizing biomolecules and initiating lipid peroxidation (8Tappel A.L. Food Res. 1953; 18: 560-573Google Scholar, 9Radi R. Thomson L. Rubbo H. Prodanov E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 112-117Google Scholar, 10Radi R. Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem.

In separate studies, it was shown that mitochondrial lipid peroxidation could be initiated by hydrogen peroxide and cytochrome c (12Radi R. Sims S. Cassina A. Turrens J.F. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 653-659Google Scholar, 13Radi R. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 409-415Google Scholar). It was postulated that hydrogen peroxide oxidized cytochrome c to a ferryl-radical, compound I-type species similar to that seen with peroxidases and metmyoglobin. The ferryl-radical form of cytochrome c would then catalyze the oxidation of biomolecules. It should be noted, that unlike metmyoglobin, no direct evidence has been obtained for a ferryl or ferryl-protein radical form of cytochrome c. However, because the reactions of both metmyoglobin and cytochrome c with hydrogen peroxide yield oxidizing species that initiate lipid peroxidation and oxidize organic substrates (8Tappel A.L.

Horse heart cytochrome c, sodium phosphate, 4-oxo-TEMPO, DTPA, and horseradish peroxidase were all purchased from Sigma. MNP, potassium cyanide, and sodium dithionite were all obtained from Aldrich and DBNBS was synthesized using the method of Kaur et al. (15Kaur H. Leung K.H.W. Perkins M.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1981; 3: 142-143Google Scholar). Perdeuterated MNP-d9 was provided as a gift from Dr. B. Kalyanaraman. Superoxide dismutase, Pronase, and glucose oxidase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The reagents and buffer were prepared using deionized water and were treated with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad). Prepacked Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) size exclusion cartridges were purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). ESR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ECS-106 spectrometer (Billerica, MA) operating at 9.77 GHz with a modulation frequency of 50 kHz and a TM110 cavity. The reactions were initiated by the addition of cytochrome c. For all ESR experiments, the reactions were allowed to proceed for 3 min. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 size exclusion column and eluted with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). This was done primarily to remove the DBNBS from the sample and to minimize the contribution of the addition reaction (i.e. ene reaction) that DBNBS is known to undergo with tryptophan (16Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Rad. Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Google Scholar). For the experiment shown in Fig. 5, glucose and glucose oxidase were added to the reaction mixture 3 min before the addition of cytochrome c to produce anaerobic conditions. Prior to the addition of glucose oxidase, the solution containing all reactants except cytochrome c was bubbled with N2 for 5 min. The reactions were all performed in 100 mM sodium phosphate solutions (pH 7.4) that contained 200 µM DTPA to inhibit possible trace-transition metal catalysis. The computer simulations were performed using a program that is available through the internet (http://www.niehs.nih/LMB. The details of the program were described in a recent publication (17Duling D.R. J. Magn. Res. 1994; 104B: 105-110Google Scholar). The concentration of the DBNBS radical adduct(s) that were detected was estimated by comparing the ESR spectrum from the cytochrome c/H2O2 reaction mixture with that of a known concentration of the stable nitroxide 4-oxo-TEMPO (100 µM) dissolved in 30% glycerol. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, placed in a TE102 cavity, and the ESR spectra were recorded. The samples were compared at liquid nitrogen temperature so that an immobilized nitroxide could be detected from the 4-oxo-TEMPO. A reasonable comparison of these two radical species was made by first determining the appropriate power and modulation amplitude that gave the greatest signal in each case. The optimum power and modulation amplitude for the DBNBS/·cyt c-derived radical adduct was 20 mW and 18 G, respectively. A power of 1 mW and 24 G was found to be optimal for 4-oxo-TEMPO. Comparison of the double integrals from the resulting ESR spectra allowed us to estimate the concentration of the DBNBS/·cyt c adduct that was detected from the reaction. The mass spectrometric analyses were performed using a Voyager RP (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) time-of-flight dual-stage reflector mass spectrometer. The instrument uses a nitrogen laser at 337 nm to desorb/ionize the samples. The accelerating voltage used was 30 kV and the flight path was 1.3 m. A beam guide wire with an applied voltage was used to refocus dispersed ions back onto the detector. Data from 256 laser pulses (laser energy between 280 and 300 arbitrary units) were averaged on a Tektronix TDS 520A digitizing oscilloscope and then downloaded to a PC. Data analysis was performed using GRAMS 386 software (Galactic Industries Corp., Salem, NH). One µl of the MALDI matrix (a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 45:45:10, ethanol:water:formic acid) and 1 µl of of a 1:200 dilution of the cytochrome c samples (as described in the figure legends) was spotted onto the MALDI target. Co-crystallization of the sample and matrix was allowed to proceed at room temperature. The relative concentration of adducts that were formed under anaerobic or aerobic conditions was estimated using the integration function of the program Microcal Origin (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). When cytochrome c was allowed to react with 5 equivalents of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of MNP, a spectrum characteristic of an immobilized nitroxide was detected (Fig. 1A). The MNP/·cyt c-derived adduct persisted following size exclusion chromatography, which demonstrated that the radical adduct was a macromolecule (i.e. protein-bound). The adduct was dependent on the presence of MNP (Fig. 1B). In the absence of MNP a broad, featureless, direct ESR spectrum of a free radical with a line width of ∼10 G was detected. When the MNP/·cyt c-derived adduct was submitted to nonspecific proteolysis, an isotropic three-line spectrum was detected with a hyperfine coupling constant of 15.5 G (Fig. 1C). This was similar to that reported by Gunther et al. (18Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16075-16081Google Scholar) for the protease digested MNP/·metMb adduct. The fact that only a three-line spectrum was detected following Pronase treatment of the adduct suggested that the radical was located on a tertiary carbon atom (i.e. none of the neighboring atoms had nuclear spin). In a previous study, Gunther et al. (18Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16075-16081Google Scholar) used a lower modulation amplitude to resolve superhyperfine structure from the DBNBS/·metMb adduct. By comparing this superhyperfine structure with that detected from an authentic DBNBS/·trp adduct, they concluded that the radical trapped by DBNBS was centered on C-3 of a tryptophan residue in metmyoglobin. We employed the same technique here, except using perdeuterated MNP (i.e. the nine methyl hydrogens were replaced with deuterium). The deuteration of MNP decreases the hyperfine structure from the nine methyl hydrogens which would otherwise broaden the spectrum and prevent the resolution of superhyperfine structure. A three-line spectrum similar to that seen in Fig. 1C was detected when MNP-d9 was used as the spin trap (aN = 15.5 G) (data not shown). An 8-gauss scan of the low-field line from this primary triplet using a modulation amplitude of 0.14 gauss revealed superhyperfine structure consisting of five well resolved lines (Fig. 2A). The simulated spectrum in Fig. 2A (dashed line) was obtained using 2 equivalent hydrogens (aH = 0.66 G (2H)) and 1 nonequivalent hydrogen (aH = 1.1 G). It was possible that such an adduct might arise from the trapping of a tyrosyl radical at the C-1 position, the sole tertiary carbon in tyrosine. To investigate this possibility, an authentic MNP-d9/·tyr adduct was produced in a separate experiment using horseradish peroxidase and H2O2 to oxidize free tyrosine. Once again, a three-line spectrum was detected with a primary nitrogen splitting of 15.6 gauss (data not shown). When an 8-gauss scan was performed using the low-field line from this primary triplet, an identical spectrum to that seen with the MNP-d9/·cyt c derived adduct was detected (Fig. 2B). When all the ring positions of tyrosine were labeled with carbon-13, the three-line spectrum detected with tyrosine (Fig. 3A) was replaced by an eight-line spectrum (Fig. 3B). This, demonstrated that the radical site was located on the aromatic ring of tyrosine. The simulation was composed using couplings from one nitrogen (aN = 15.6 G), an α-carbon-13 (a13Cα = 7.1 G), and 2 equivalent β-carbon-13 atoms (a13Cβ = 8.0 G) (Fig. 3B, dashed line).Fig. 3Effect of 13C labeling on the ESR spectrum from the MNP/tyrosyl radical adduct. A, the reaction mixture contained 2 mM tyrosine, 0.1 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase, 150 µM H2O2, and 18 mM MNP (nondeuterated). B, the reaction mixture was the same as A except, tyrosine labeled with 13C in all the ring positions was used (dashed line is the simulation). The structure of the proposed radical adduct is shown with the carbon atoms that are positioned α and β with respect to the nitroxide moiety labeled. The instrument settings were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 1C, except the time constant was 0.65 s and the scan time was 671 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An immobilized nitroxide was also detected when the reaction was performed in the presence of DBNBS (Fig. 4A). The spectrum was not observed in the absence of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4B). Care was taken to ensure that the immobilized radical adduct was not formed by the ene reaction known to occur with DBNBS (16Hiramoto K. Hasegawa Y. Kikugawa K. Free Rad. Res. 1994; 21: 341-349Google Scholar). This reaction involves the addition of the DBNBS nitroso function to double bonds and is independent of peroxide. The ene reaction is relatively slow and, thus, the possibility of its interference was eliminated by using short incubation times and a G-25 size exclusion column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cyanide forms a low-spin ferric complex with cytochrome c and inhibits heme-catalyzed reactions (19Dyer C. Schubert A. Timkovich R. Feinberg B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 253-268Google Scholar). Accordingly, the addition of 1 M potassium cyanide prior to that of H2O2 prevented the formation of the DBNBS adduct (data not shown). There was no effect when 1 M potassium cyanide was added after the adduct had already been formed. The addition of DTPA, even at a final concentration of 10 mM, had no effect on the intensity of the ESR spectrum (data not shown). Therefore, the DBNBS adduct was not formed as a result of iron release from cytochrome c. The DBNBS adduct was also detected using ferrous cytochrome c (formed from dithionite reduction followed by size exclusion chromatography). This was not unexpected as the reaction of H2O2 with ferrous cytochrome c to form ferric cytochrome c has been reported (20Turrens J.F. McCord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 43-46Google Scholar). When DBNBS was incubated alone with the cytochrome c and then reacted with H2O2 after passing the sample over a G-25 column, the immobilized nitroxide was not observed (Fig. 4C). Instead, the same spectrum as seen in Fig. 1B was detected. This spectrum was detected again when cytochrome c was allowed to react with hydrogen peroxide in the complete absence of any spin trap (Fig. 4D). When the sample from Fig. 4A was submitted to nonspecific proteolysis, an isotropic ESR spectrum of one major and one or more minor species was detected (Fig. 4E). This spectrum consisted primarily of three lines with a hyperfine coupling constant of 13.6 G, which was similar to that reported for the proteolyzed DBNBS/·metMb adduct (18Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16075-16081Google Scholar). The intensity of the DBNBS adduct increased dramatically both before and after proteolysis when the reaction was performed in the absence of O2 (data not shown). This indicated that DBNBS was competing with O2 for reaction with the radical site(s). In previous studies a protein-derived peroxyl radical has been detected at 77 K following the reaction of metmyoglobin with hydrogen peroxide (21Kelman D.J. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7458-7463Google Scholar). We were unable, however, to detect a peroxyl radical from the cytochrome c/hydrogen peroxide reaction mixture. When the DBNBS/·cyt c-derived adduct obtained from the anaerobic reaction was proteolyzed, a more intense, but otherwise identical spectrum to that seen in Fig. 4E was detected (data not shown). The concentration of the DBNBS/·cyt c-derived adduct that was detected under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions was estimated by comparing frozen samples with the stable nitroxide standard, 4-oxo-TEMPO. The method for quantitation was described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using this method we were able to estimate that ∼50 µM adduct (10% of the initial cytochrome c concentration) was detected under aerobic conditions while ∼250 µM adduct (50% of the initial cytochrome c concentration) was detected using anaerobic conditions. Features from additional radical adducts can be seen in the ESR spectrum shown in Fig. 4E. Thus, it seemed probable that other radical sites were formed during the reaction that were trapped by DBNBS, but not MNP. To confirm that more than one DBNBS adduct was formed, the reaction of cytochrome c with hydrogen peroxide was analyzed using MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry (22Karas M. Bahr U. Giebmann U. Mass Spect. Rev. 1991; 10: 335-358Google Scholar). This technique uses energy transfer from a UV absorbing matrix to ionize the sample and is particularly useful for detecting samples of high molecular mass (i.e. 1–300 kDa). It is considered a soft ionization technique and, thus, the parent ion rather than fragment ions are detected. Because the mass spectrometer determines the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of an analyte rather than the mass directly, multiple protonation leads to spectra that contain ions at fractional mass. Fig. 5A shows the MALDI spectrum of the (M + H)1+, (M + 2H)2+, and (M + 3H)3+ molecular ions of native cytochrome c. Fig. 5B displays an expanded view of the (M + H)1+ ion. The shoulder observed at slightly higher mass is due to the noncovalent binding of a matrix ion to native cytochrome c. Following the reaction of cytochrome c with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of DBNBS, an additional ion was detected that had a molecular mass ∼344 daltons higher than native cytochrome c (Fig. 6A). The (M + 2H)2+ and (M + 3H)3+ ions for this adduct were also detected (data not shown). This adduct corresponded to the addition of one DBNBS (Mr = 344) to native cytochrome c. When the reaction of cytochrome c was performed in the absence of O2, four additional ions were detected, each increasing in molecular mass by ∼344 daltons (Fig. 6B). These ions corresponded to the addition of one, two, three, and four DBNBS molecules per cytochrome c. None of the ions with DBNBS additions were detected in the absence of hydrogen peroxide or DBNBS (data not shown). The estimated relative concentration of adduct(s) detected by MALDI was in reasonable agreement with the ESR quantitation data, as 8% of the total cytochrome c was detected under aerobic conditions as adduct while 63% was detected under anaerobic conditions. In the present study, an immobilized nitroxide was detected when either DBNBS or MNP was added to the reaction mixture containing cytochrome c and hydrogen peroxide. This type of protein-derived immobilized nitroxide has been observed from the reaction of other heme proteins such as myoglobin with H2O2 (18Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16075-16081Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450 with cumene hydroperoxide (23Barr D.P. Martin M.V. Guengerich F.P. Mason R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 318-325Google Scholar). Nonspecific proteolysis of either the DBNBS or MNP/·cyt c-derived adducts definitively indicated, that the radical site was located on a tertiary carbon. This was because only a three-line ESR spectrum was observed. If the radical were centered on a carbon that was adjacent to atoms with nuclear spin, additional hyperfine coupling would have been observed. Tyrosine and tryptophan provide two likely possibilities for the formation of a radical adduct that would yield the primary triplet observed in these studies. This is because considerable spin density resides on the C-3 position of the tryptophan radical and on the C-1 ring position of the tyrosyl radical (24Hoffman B.M. Roberts J.E. Kang C.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6556-6564Google Scholar, 25O'Malley P.J. MacFarlane A.J. Rigby S.E.J. Nugent J.H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 175-179Google Scholar). Both of these carbon atoms are tertiary, and radical adducts formed from either of them with DBNBS or MNP would yield three-line ESR spectra. In fact, photolysis studies have shown that the MNP adducts obtained from free tryptophan or tyrosine yield three-line ESR spectra (26Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 53-62Google Scholar, 27Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 43-52Google Scholar), although the structure of the tyrosine radical adduct was not characterized until now. The aN values presented here for the DBNBS/·cyt c-derived and MNP/·cyt c-derived adducts were almost identical to those reported for the corresponding metmyoglobin adducts (18Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16075-16081Google Scholar). In addition, the aN value for the MNP/·cyt c-derived adduct was very similar to those reported for either free tryptophan or free tyrosine (18Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16075-16081Google Scholar, 26Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 53-62Google Scholar, 27Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 43-52Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed highly probable that, with the proteins, MNP was trapping a radical that was centered on the tertiary carbon of either tryptophan or tyrosine. Since both tryptophan and tyrosine radicals form adducts with MNP that have similar primary aN values (26Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 53-62Google Scholar, 27Lion Y. Kuwabara M. Riesz P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 43-52Google Scholar), superhyperfine structure was needed to determine which MNP adduct was formed from cytochrome c. We were able to resolve this issue by comparing the high resolution ESR spectra obtained from the MNP-d9/·cyt c-derived adduct with that of an authentic MNP-d9/·tyr adduct. The fact that these ESR spectra were identical served as unambiguous proof that the radical trapped by MNP from the reaction of cytochrome c with H2O2 was centered on a tyrosine residue. We also re-examined the reaction of metmyoglobin with H2O2 using MNP-d9. Gunther et al. (18Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16075-16081Google Scholar) recently reported that MNP trapped a tryptophan radical from metmyoglobin. However, we have found that the same high resolution ESR spectrum can be detected from the MNP-d9/·metMb adduct (data not shown) as was seen with either the MNP-d9/·cyt c-derived or MNP-d9/·tyr adduct. Thus, MNP trapped a tyrosyl radical, and not a tryptophan radical, from metmyoglobin during its reaction with H2O2. It is possible that the tyrosyl radicals that have been found to cause cross-linking of metmyoglobin (28Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Google Scholar) were trapped by MNP. Evidence that the radical site was located on the aromatic ring of tyrosine was provided by the fact that an eight-line spectrum replaced the three-line spectrum when tyrosine labeled with carbon-13 in the ring positions was used. The eight-line spectrum was simulated convincingly by incorporating the spin = 1/2 couplings from an α carbon-13 (the one position of the ring) and 2 equivalent β carbon-13 atoms (the two and six positions of the ring). The coupling to three hydrogens that was detected in the MNP-d9 experiment combined with the fact that a significant fraction of the spin density is known to reside on C-1, indicated to us that C-1 was the radical site trapped by MNP. The structure of the radical adduct with the α and β carbons labeled is shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that attempts were made to resolve superhyperfine structure from the MNP-d9/·trp adduct (produced by HRP/H2O2, data not shown). However, the resolution of superhyperfine structure from this adduct was poor, and the lines that were seen did not resemble those that were seen from the MNP-d9/·cyt c-derived adduct. The ESR spectrum of the proteolyzed DBNBS/·cyt c-derived sample revealed an additional adduct (Fig. 4E). Although it was clear from the MNP data that a tyrosyl radical had formed during the reaction, other radical sites may have formed that were trapped by DBNBS but not MNP. We also could not rule out the possibility that DBNBS was trapping a different radical site than MNP. Because of this complexity, we utilized MALDI/MS to detect additional protein-derived adducts, including ESR silent adducts that may be formed if the nitroxide moiety is reduced (i.e. to the hydroxylamine). In the presence of O2 only one DBNBS/·cyt c-derived adduct was detected by MALDI/MS. However, when anaerobic conditions were enforced, as many as four DBNBS/·cyt c-derived adducts were observed. This indicated that more than one radical site in cytochrome c was formed during the reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The identity of these additional DBNBS adducts remains unknown. It is probable that DBNBS is trapping a radical centered on tryptophan 59, the only tryptophan in cytochrome c. There are also four tyrosines in cytochrome c, so trapping of multiple tyrosine residues is another possibility. If these additional adducts are formed and then rapidly reduced, they would be detectable by MALDI/MS, but not ESR. The fact that these additional adducts were not observed in the presence of O2 may indicate that short-lived peroxyl radicals (which do not form persistent DBNBS radical adducts) were formed more readily than the DBNBS carbon-centered adducts under aerobic conditions. Although we were unable to detect peroxyl radicals with ESR, the fact that both the ESR and MALDI/MS spectra of the DBNBS/·cyt c-derived adduct(s) were affected so dramatically by the omission of O2 strongly suggests peroxyl radical formation. Much work has been performed with metmyoglobin to elucidate the oxidative intermediates formed during the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water (18Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 354-362Google Scholar). The existence of a protein radical in metmyoglobin following the reaction with hydrogen peroxide was demonstrated using ESR as early as 1958 by Gibson et al. (29Gibson J.F. Ingram D.J.E. Nicholls P. Nature. 1958; 181: 1398-1399Google Scholar). However, there seems to be, in general, a void in the literature concerning the oxidative intermediate formed during the reaction of cytochrome c with hydrogen peroxide. To our knowledge this is the first report of tyrosyl radical formation from the reaction of cytochrome c with hydrogen peroxide. An earlier study by Davies et al. (35Davies M.J. Gilbert B.C. Haywood R.M. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1991; 15: 111-127Google Scholar) reported the formation of an immobilized nitroxide from cytochrome c, but the experiment was done using a Fenton reaction (i.e. ferrous EDTA and hydrogen peroxide), and the adduct was not characterized. The formation of a tyrosyl radical in cytochrome c might be explained in an analogous way to that of metmyoglobin (34Miki H. Harada K. Yamazaki I. Tamura M. Watanabe H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 354-362Google Scholar). That is, hydrogen peroxide is reduced to water forming a ferryl-porphyrin radical, compound I type species (which, in the case of cytochrome c and metmyoglobin, is very short-lived). Rapid electron transfer from a tyrosine residue to the porphyrin radical could be used to rationalize the absence of spectroscopic evidence for a compound I species. However, there is also a lack of spectroscopic evidence for a ferryl compound II-type species for cytochrome c. It is possible that the ferryl form of cytochrome c also rapidly oxidizes amino acids in the vicinity of the heme or, perhaps, the heme itself. Thus, no spectral intermediates are detected and the Soret absorbance spectrum merely bleaches (36Roubal W.T. Tappel A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 113: 150-155Google Scholar, 37Florence T.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1985; 23: 131-141Google Scholar, 38Kanner J. Harel S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 314-321Google Scholar). The fact that as many as four DBNBS adducts were detected on one molecule of cytochrome c by MALDI/MS suggested that cytochrome c turned over more than one time under the conditions used here (5 molar equivalents of hydrogen peroxide). Numerous investigations have demonstrated that, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, metmyoglobin and cytochrome c can initiate lipid peroxidation (8Tappel A.L. Food Res. 1953; 18: 560-573Google Scholar, 10Radi R. Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 118-125Google Scholar, 11Maiorino M. Ursini F. Cadenas E. Free Rad. Biol.

Biophys. 1993; 300: 409-415Google Scholar, 14Galaris D. Sevanian A. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 163-169Google Scholar), and the results presented here could provide a mechanism for cytochrome c-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. Since the cytochrome c-catalyzed lipid peroxidation reported by Radi et al. (10Radi R. Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 118-125Google Scholar) was not affected by hydroxyl radical scavengers or metal chelators, the Haber-Weiss type reaction was excluded as a possible mechanism. Instead, it was proposed that cytochrome c formed a ferryl, radical intermediate that was responsible for catalyzing the initial oxidation. While both cytochrome c and myoglobin catalyze hydrogen peroxide-dependent reactions that are characteristic of a ferryl-heme species, a visible absorption spectrum indicative of a ferryl myoglobin species was obtained decades ago (30George P. Irvine D.H. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 511-517Google Scholar), while no such evidence has yet been obtained for cytochrome c. In addition, since the crystal structure of aqueous cytochrome c shows the heme iron to be hexacoordinate, with a methionine ligand occupying the sixth position (39Dickerson R.E. Takano T. Eisenberg D. Kallai O.B. Samson L. Cooper A. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1511-1533Google Scholar), one might argue that it is not possible for H2O2 to gain access to the heme iron. However, several studies have demonstrated that this ligand is easily displaced by small changes in ionic strength, pH, or the presence of other ligands (19Dyer C. Schubert A. Timkovich R. Feinberg B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 253-268Google Scholar, 40Osheroff N. Borden D. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1689-1697Google Scholar, 41Wuthrich K. Aviram I. Schejter A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 253: 98-103Google Scholar). Thus, it is not unreasonable to presume that H2O2 might displace this ligand. In fact, the heme iron is definitely required as cyanide (a known inhibitor of heme-catalyzed reactions due to its ability to form a ligand in the sixth position) has been shown to inhibit cytochrome c-catalyzed oxidations (10Radi R. Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 118-125Google Scholar). In the present study, we also found that cyanide inhibited the formation of the adduct(s). Considering the data presented here, we suggest that an amino acid radical, formed via the aforementioned mechanism, may be responsible for the previously reported oxidations catalyzed by the cytochrome c/H2O2 system (10Radi R. Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 118-125Google Scholar, 11Maiorino M. Ursini F. Cadenas E. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 661-667Google Scholar, 12Radi R. Sims S. Cassina A. Turrens J.F. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 653-659Google Scholar, 13Radi R. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 409-415Google Scholar). From a space-filling model obtained from the crystal structure of cytochrome c, we observed that tryptophan 59 and three tyrosine residues are solvent-exposed. It is also known that an edge of the heme in cytochrome c is solvent-exposed (39Dickerson R.E. Takano T. Eisenberg D. Kallai O.B. Samson L. Cooper A. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1511-1533Google Scholar). Therefore, a radical formed at any one of these positions may allow the oxidation of molecules that are unable (possibly for steric reasons) to gain access to the heme iron. In the present study, only the tyrosine radical was definitively identified using MNP-d9. The identity of the other radical site(s) will require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2010239636,"Proton pump activity is not measurable in the plasma membrane of unstimulated neutrophils but becomes readily detectable upon activation by soluble agonists. The mechanism of pump activation was investigated in this report. V-type H+ pump activity, estimated as a bafilomycin A1-sensitive elevation of the cytosolic pH, was stimulated in suspended neutrophils by chemotactic peptides and by phorbol esters. Stimulation of pump activity induced by the agonists was greatly enhanced by cytochalasin B, an agent known to potentiate granular secretion in neutrophils. We therefore compared the rate and extent of pump activation with the pattern of exocytosis of the four types of secretory organelles present in neutrophils, using flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The kinetics of exocytosis of secretory vesicles and secondary and tertiary granules but not primary granules paralleled the appearance of pump activity. The subcellular localization of the pump was defined by cellular fractionation and immunoblotting using an antibody to the C subunit of the V-type ATPase. The pump was abundant in tertiary granules, with significant amounts present also in primary granules and secretory vesicles. The pump was scarce in secondary granules and not detectable in the cytosol. Finally, the agonists failed to stimulate pump activity in neutrophil cytoplasts, which are intact cell fragments devoid of acidic granules. Together, our results suggest that the V-type H+-ATPase is not constitutively present in the plasma membrane of neutrophils but is delivered to the surface membrane by exocytosis during cellular activation. Tertiary granules and secretory vesicles are the most likely source of V-ATPases. Following insertion in the plasma membrane, the pump is poised to effectively extrude the excess metabolic acid that is generated during chemotaxis and bacterial killing."
https://openalex.org/W1973485369,"N-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) is an important molecule in biological recognition systems. NeuAc is known to be biosynthesized either from UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine by an action of UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase or from N-acetyl-D-glucosamine by N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase (GlcNAc 2-epimerase). However, the physiological function of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase in NeuAc biosynthesis has not been fully evaluated. To clarify the role of GlcNAc 2-epimerase in NeuAc biosynthesis, the enzyme and its gene were isolated from porcine kidney cortex. Escherichia coli cells transformed with the gene expressed the GlcNAc 2-epimerase having the same properties as those of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase from porcine kidney. Sequence analysis indicated that the gene was capable of synthesizing a 46.5-kDa protein (402 amino acids) with a conserved leucine zipper motif. Homology search for the cloned gene revealed that the GlcNAc 2-epimerase was identical with renin-binding protein (RnBP) in porcine kidney (Inoue, H., Fukui, K., Takahashi, S., and Miyake, Y.

INTRODUCTIONN-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) 1The abbreviations used are: NeuAcN-acetylneuraminic acidRnBPrenin-binding proteinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is an important constituent of the carbohydrate chain of many glycoproteins and glycolipids, and has an important function in many biological recognition processes (1Shauer R. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1982; 40: 131-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of NeuAc has been studied extensively in vivo and in vitro (2McGuire E.J. Rosenberg A. Schengrund C.L. Biological Roles of Sialic Acid. Plenum Press, New York1976: 123Crossref Google Scholar, 3Warren L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Publishing Co., Amsterdam, London and New York1972: 1097Google Scholar). Two kinds of 2-epimerases have been assigned in the first step of the NeuAc biosynthetic pathway. One is N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase (GlcNAc 2-epimerase) (EC.5.1.3.8) catalyzing the interconversion of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). The other one is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase (UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase) (EC.5.1.3.14). The enzyme catalyzes the direct formation of ManNAc from UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) (4Van Rinsum J. Van Dijk W. Hooghwinkel G.J.M. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ManNAc formed by either reaction is eventually converted to cytidine 5′-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) through the consecutive reactions: GlcNAc or UDP-GlcNAc → ManNAc → ManNAc 6-phosphate → NeuAc 9-phosphate → NeuAc → CMP-NeuAc (5Kornfeld S. Kornfeld R. Neufeld E.F. O'Brien P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 6Ginsburg V. Adv. Enzymol. 1964; 26: 35-88PubMed Google Scholar). CMP-NeuAc is utilized as a precursor for the synthesis of connective tissues, blood cells, and other cellular macromolecules.Of the two 2-epimerases catalyzing the formation of ManNAc, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase has been considered to be essential in the NeuAc biosynthesis (4Van Rinsum J. Van Dijk W. Hooghwinkel G.J.M. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the physiological significance of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase in the formation of NeuAc is not known. However, no definitive evidence denying the participation of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase in the NeuAc biosynthesis together with UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase has been presented.The GlcNAc 2-epimerase has been found in porcine kidney, rat kidney, liver, spleen, brain, intestinal mucosa, thymus, pancreas, and in salivary gland (4Van Rinsum J. Van Dijk W. Hooghwinkel G.J.M. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Kornfeld S. Kornfeld R. Neufeld E.F. O'Brien P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1531-1536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) partially purified the enzyme from porcine kidney and found that the GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity is modulated by the catalytic amount of ATP. Datta (7Datta A. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3363-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) also reported that the GlcNAc 2-epimerase possesses two distinct interaction sites, a catalytic site for substrate and an allosteric site for ATP.To clarify reaction mechanism and function of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase, we have isolated from porcine kidney the enzyme and its gene, and analyzed their properties. Surprisingly, the GlcNAc 2-epimerase was found to be identical with a renin-binding protein (RnBP) isolated from porcine kidney (9Takahashi S. Ohsawa T. Miura R. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Inoue H. Fukui K. Takahashi S. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6556-6561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of RnBP has been presumed by several investigators. Leckie and McConnell (11Leckie B.J. McConnell A. Circ. Res. 1975; 36: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) suggested that RnBP is a regulator of renin because RnBP can tightly bind to renin and inhibit the renin activity. Boyd (12Boyd G.W. Circ. Res. 1974; 35: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) proposed that RnBP is a renin carrier. Murakami et al. (13Murakami K. Chino S. Hirose S. Higaki J. Biomed. Res. 1980; 1: 476-481Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) showed that the binding of RnBP is highly specific to renin and does not interact with other acid proteases in the kidney. Furthermore, in tissues containing renin, RnBP was always detected (14Tada M. Takahashi S. Miyano M. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Takahashi et al. (15Takahashi S. Inoue H. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13007-13013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that human RnBP gene is located in chromosome X, spans about 10 kilobases and consists of 11 exons separated by 10 introns. Tribioli et al. (16Tribioli C. Mancini M. Plassart E. Bione S. Rivella S. Sala C. Torri G. Toniolo D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Faranda et al. (17Faranda S. Frattini A. Vezzoni P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) indicated that the RnBP gene is mapped in distal Xq28 chromosomal band, closely linked to a housekeeping host cell factor 1-encoding gene, and both genes are transcribed in the same direction from telomere to centromere.In this paper, we report purification and molecular cloning of GlcNAc 2-epimerase from porcine kidney, and demonstrate the renin-binding ability of GlcNAc 2-epimerase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPorcine kidney was obtained from the Kyoto wholesale market. Porcine kidney renin was purchased from Sigma. DEAE-cellulose DE-52 was from Whatman. Q Sepharose FF, Sephadex G-100, Superose 12 HR 10/30, and Mono Q HR 5/5 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Butyl-Toyopearl 650M was from Tosoh. Hydroxyapatite and lysyl endopeptidase were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. The ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit, Gigapack II Gold packaging extract, and the Exo/Mung deletion kit were from Stratagene. Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.GlcNAc 2-Epimerase AssayGlcNAc 2-epimerase was assayed by measuring interconversion of GlcNAc and ManNAc. The reaction mixture (0.1 ml) consisted of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mM ManNAc, 4 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 µl of enzyme. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 3 min. The reaction products were treated with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone, and the derivatives were analyzed by HPLC (18Honda S. Akao E. Suzuki S. Okuda M. Kakehi K. Nakamura J. Anal. Chem. 1989; 180: 351-357Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was the quantity that produced 1 µmol of GlcNAc/1 min under the assay conditions.Purification of GlcNAc 2-EpimeraseUnless otherwise noted, all operations were carried out at 0–4°C. The potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6 (KPB), used always contained 1.0 mM EDTA and 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol. Centrifugation was carried out at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and dialysis was for 16 h against 20 mM KPB.GlcNAc 2-Epimerase in Porcine KidneyKidney cortex (5.6 kg) was homogenized in 12 liters of 3.0 mM KPB. The supernatant (11.7 liters) obtained after centrifugation was diluted with 11.7 liters of cold water followed by adding 705 ml of 2.0% protamine sulfate. Precipitated materials were removed, and the supernatant (22.9 liters) was treated again with 2.3 liters of 2.0% protamine sulfate. Precipitates were washed in 5 liters of 10 mM KPB, and then the extract (5.8 l) was treated for 10 min with 58 g of bentonite, which was suspended in 580 ml of 1 mM EDTA. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was dialyzed. The dialysate (6.5 liters) was put on a DEAE-cellulose DE-52 column (25 × 13 cm). After washing the column with 50 mM KPB containing 100 mM KCl, the GlcNAc 2-epimerase was eluted with 200 mM KPB containing 150 mM KCl. Ammonium sulfate (6.7 kg) was added to the eluate (12 liters) to 80% saturation. The precipitates were dissolved in 200 ml of 20 mM KPB and dialyzed. The dialysate (280 ml) was put on a hydroxyapatite column (2.6 × 9.5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mM KPB, and the enzyme was eluted with 324 ml of the same buffer. The enzyme was treated with ammonium sulfate (80%) and dialyzed. The dialysate (40 ml) was put on a Q Sepharose column (2.6 × 10 cm), and developed with a linear gradient (1 liter) of 100–400 mM KCl in 20 mM KPB. The GlcNAc 2-epimerase was eluted at 180–220 mM KCl. Active fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration with a ultrafilter UK-10 (Toyo Roshi Kaisha) and dialyzed. The dialysate (12 ml) was put on a Mono Q column. The column was washed with 20 mM KPB containing 200 mM KCl and developed with a linear gradient (20 ml) of 200–300 mM KCl in 20 mM KPB. The GlcNAc 2-epimerase was eluted at about 240 mM KCl. Active fractions were concentrated with ammonium sulfate (80%) and used throughout this study after dialysis.GlcNAc 2-Epimerase Expressed in Escherichia coliE. coli XL1-Blue were transformed with a plasmid pEP114 (see “cDNA Library, Subcloning, and Nucleotide Sequencing” for subcloning) an aerobically grown for 16 h at 30°C in Luria-Bertani medium (7 l) supplemented with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. The washed cells (about 32 g wet weight) were suspended in 350 ml of KPB, disrupted by sonication. After adding 93 mg of protamine to 340 ml of extract, the mixture was stirred gently for 30 min and centrifuged. The precipitates were discarded, and 3.5 g of bentonite was added to 350 ml of the supernatant. After incubation for 10 min, the precipitates were discarded. The enzyme was treated with ammonium sulfate (80%) and dialyzed. The dialysate was put on a DEAE-cellulose DE-52 column (5 × 20 cm) and then the enzyme was eluted with 200 mM KPB containing 150 mM KCl. Fractions containing GlcNAc 2-epimerase were concentrated with ammonium sulfate (80%) and dialyzed. The dialysate was put on a Sephadex G-100 column (5 × 90 cm), and then the enzyme was eluted with 20 mM KPB containing 200 mM KCl. Active fractions were concentrated with ammonium sulfate (80%) and dialyzed. The dialysate was put on a Q Sepharose column (2.6 × 10 cm), and then the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 100 to 400 mM KCl in 20 mM KPB. Active fractions, which were eluted between 180 and 220 mM KCl, were concentrated with ammonium sulfate (80%) and dialyzed. The dialysate was put on a Butyl-Toyopearl 650 M column (2.6 × 10 cm) and then the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 30 to 0% ammonium sulfate in 20 mM KPB. The enzyme was eluted between 19.5 and 13.5% ammonium sulfate. The active fractions were concentrated with ammonium sulfate (80%), dissolved in 8 ml of 20 mM KPB and then dialyzed.Preparation of Anti-GlcNAc 2-Epimerase AntibodyA Japanese white rabbit was injected subcutaneously into foot pads on the back with 1 ml of emulsion containing 840 µg of the purified GlcNAc 2-epimerase from porcine kidney cortex and complete Friend's adjuvant. The same amount of GlcNAc 2-epimerase emulsion was injected at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the first injection. After 8.5 weeks, bleeding was performed. Blood was allowed to clot at 37°C for 30 min and was then stored at 4°C overnight. An antiserum was separated from clots by centrifugation, added to 0.01% NaN3, and stored at 4°C. An IgG from the antiserum was purified with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia).Inhibition of Renin by GlcNAc 2-EpimeraseInhibitory effect on the renin activity by GlcNAc 2-epimerase was assayed according to the method of Takahashi et al. (9Takahashi S. Ohsawa T. Miura R. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Porcine kidney renin (1.4 pmol) was incubated at 37°C for 30 min in the presence or absence of GlcNAc 2-epimerase in a mixture (0.1 ml) containing 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 µM leupeptin, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 0.9 ml of chilled sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 µM leupeptin, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin. Remaining renin activity was assayed by measuring the rate of formation of angiotensin I from porcine plasma angiotensinogen (19Takahashi S. Ohsawa T. Miura R. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Binding of Renin with GlcNAc 2-EpimerasePorcine kidney renin (1.4 pmol) was incubated at 37°C for 30 min in the presence or absence of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase (140 pmol) in the mixture (0.1 ml) as described above. After incubation, the mixture was put on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 50 mM KPB containing 150 mM KCl and incubation products were eluted with the same buffer at 1.0 ml/min. Renin activity in each fraction (0.5 ml) was determined as described above.cDNA Library, Subcloning, and Nucleotide SequencingTotal RNAs were extracted from porcine kidney cortex in acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform mixture (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was fractionated on oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography. The cDNA library was constructed as described by Gubler and Hoffman (21Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3066) Google Scholar) by using λ DNA phage (λ ZAP) vector and E. coli SURE host. The cDNA library of 1.2 × 106 clones was screened by immunostaining using an anti-GlcNAc 2-epimerase antibody raised in rabbit. Briefly, 64 positive clones were identified using a primary antibody directed against the protein of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase and the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (goat). One of the positive clones were converted to phagemids carrying cDNA insert (1.4 kilobase pairs) in the sense orientation between EcoRI and XhoI sites of pBluescript SK(−) by in vivo excision in E. coli XL1-Blue host with R408 helper phage, and plasmid thus constructed was designated pEPI1. Sequential unidirectional deletion of the recombinant plasmid pEPI1 was carried out by cleavage at a unique SacI site of multicloning site, followed by digestion with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease. These deletion fragments were self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and the recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue. One of the recombinant plasmids thus generated had a deletion of about 60 base pairs of nucleotide sequence localized 5′ terminus in cDNA 5′-noncoding region and was designated pEP114. The nucleotides of cDNA were sequences in both strands by the dideoxy sequencing method of Sanger et al. (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52357) Google Scholar).Preparation of Peptide and Amino Acid AnalysisGlcNAc 2-epimerase (0.5 mg) from porcine kidney cortex was digested with 5 µg of lysyl endopeptidase in 0.5 ml of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 4 M urea at 37°C for 12 h. After reaction, the peptides were separated with a reversed-phase HPLC column (µBondasphere 5µ C18-300Å, 3.9 × 150 mm, Waters). N-terminal amino acids of protein or peptide were sequences by automated Edman degradation (23Edman P. Acta Chem. Scand. 1950; 4: 283-293Crossref Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer (model 477A). C-terminal amino acids of protein were sequenced using carboxypeptidase Y by Klemm et al. (24Klemm P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Free amino acids and hydrolyzed peptides were constant-boiling hydrochloric acid at 112°C for 24 h were analyzed with a Hitachi amino acid analyzer (model L8500).ElectrophoresisSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was done with 10–20% gradient gel as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.Computer AnalysisHomology analyses with other nucleotide and protein sequences were done using the FASTA comparison program (26Pearson W.R.

INTRODUCTIONN-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) 1The abbreviations used are: NeuAcN-acetylneuraminic acidRnBPrenin-binding proteinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is an important constituent of the carbohydrate chain of many glycoproteins and glycolipids, and has an important function in many biological recognition processes (1Shauer R. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1982; 40: 131-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of NeuAc has been studied extensively in vivo and in vitro (2McGuire E.J. Rosenberg A. Schengrund C.L. Biological Roles of Sialic Acid. Plenum Press, New York1976: 123Crossref Google Scholar, 3Warren L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Publishing Co., Amsterdam, London and New York1972: 1097Google Scholar). Two kinds of 2-epimerases have been assigned in the first step of the NeuAc biosynthetic pathway. One is N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase (GlcNAc 2-epimerase) (EC.5.1.3.8) catalyzing the interconversion of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). The other one is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase (UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase) (EC.5.1.3.14). The enzyme catalyzes the direct formation of ManNAc from UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) (4Van Rinsum J. Van Dijk W. Hooghwinkel G.J.M. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ManNAc formed by either reaction is eventually converted to cytidine 5′-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) through the consecutive reactions: GlcNAc or UDP-GlcNAc → ManNAc → ManNAc 6-phosphate → NeuAc 9-phosphate → NeuAc → CMP-NeuAc (5Kornfeld S. Kornfeld R. Neufeld E.F. O'Brien P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 6Ginsburg V. Adv. Enzymol. 1964; 26: 35-88PubMed Google Scholar). CMP-NeuAc is utilized as a precursor for the synthesis of connective tissues, blood cells, and other cellular macromolecules.Of the two 2-epimerases catalyzing the formation of ManNAc, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase has been considered to be essential in the NeuAc biosynthesis (4Van Rinsum J. Van Dijk W. Hooghwinkel G.J.M. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the physiological significance of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase in the formation of NeuAc is not known. However, no definitive evidence denying the participation of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase in the NeuAc biosynthesis together with UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase has been presented.The GlcNAc 2-epimerase has been found in porcine kidney, rat kidney, liver, spleen, brain, intestinal mucosa, thymus, pancreas, and in salivary gland (4Van Rinsum J.

Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1531-1536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) partially purified the enzyme from porcine kidney and found that the GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity is modulated by the catalytic amount of ATP. Datta (7Datta A. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3363-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) also reported that the GlcNAc 2-epimerase possesses two distinct interaction sites, a catalytic site for substrate and an allosteric site for ATP.To clarify reaction mechanism and function of the GlcNAc 2-epimerase, we have isolated from porcine kidney the enzyme and its gene, and analyzed their properties. Surprisingly, the GlcNAc 2-epimerase was found to be identical with a renin-binding protein (RnBP) isolated from porcine kidney (9Takahashi S. Ohsawa T. Miura R. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Inoue H. Fukui K. Takahashi S. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6556-6561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of RnBP has been presumed by several investigators. Leckie and McConnell (11Leckie B.J. McConnell A. Circ. Res. 1975; 36: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) suggested that RnBP is a regulator of renin because RnBP can tightly bind to renin and inhibit the renin activity. Boyd (12Boyd G.W. Circ. Res. 1974; 35: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) proposed that RnBP is a renin carrier. Murakami et al. (13Murakami K. Chino S. Hirose S. Higaki J. Biomed. Res. 1980; 1: 476-481Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) showed that the binding of RnBP is highly specific to renin and does not interact with other acid proteases in the kidney. Furthermore, in tissues containing renin, RnBP was always detected (14Tada M. Takahashi S. Miyano M. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Takahashi et al. (15Takahashi S. Inoue H. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13007-13013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that human RnBP gene is located in chromosome X, spans about 10 kilobases and consists of 11 exons separated by 10 introns. Tribioli et al. (16Tribioli C. Mancini M. Plassart E. Bione S. Rivella S. Sala C. Torri G. Toniolo D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Faranda et al. (17Faranda S. Frattini A. Vezzoni P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) indicated that the RnBP gene is mapped in distal Xq28 chromosomal band, closely linked to a housekeeping host cell factor 1-encoding gene, and both genes are transcribed in the same direction from telomere to centromere.In this paper, we report purification and molecular cloning of GlcNAc 2-epimerase from porcine kidney, and demonstrate the renin-binding ability of GlcNAc 2-epimerase.

https://openalex.org/W2020041839,"In Chlamydomonas, as in higher plants, synthesis of ADP glucose catalyzed by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is rate-limiting for the building of starch in the chloroplast. We have isolated disruptions of the STA1 ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase structural gene that rendered the enzyme less responsive to the allosteric activator 3-phosphoglycerate. The structure and composition of the residual starch synthesized by all mutants of the STA1 locus is dramatically altered. The residual polysaccharide is shown to be devoid of amylose despite the presence of granule-bound starch synthase, the amylose biosynthetic enzyme. In addition, the fine structure of the mutant amylopectin revealed the presence of an altered chain-length distribution. This distribution mimicks that which is observed during growth and photosynthesis and differs markedly from that observed during storage. We therefore propose that low nucleotide sugar concentrations are either directly or indirectly responsible for the major differences observed in the composition or structure of starch during storage and photosynthesis.

Starch is usually defined as a mix of two distinct polymer fractions, amylopectin and amylose. Amylopectin, the major compound, is composed of intermediate size α(1→4)-linked glucans that are organized in clusters of parallel chains (the crystal lamella) by a dense packing of α(1→6) linkages (the amorphous lamella). The sum of both lamellae in a unit cluster is precisely 9 nm in all plants analyzed to date, which is suggestive of a highly ordered and well conserved biosynthetic pathway (Jenkins et al., 11Jenkins P.J. Cameron R.E. Donald A.M. Staerke. 1993; 45: 417-420Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Amylose is often referred to as a smaller linear molecule with very few α(1→6) branches (for review, see 22Manners D.J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1989; 11: 87-112Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). ADP-glucose is now firmly established as the sole precursor for starch synthesis and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC) as the rate-limiting step in the pathway (Tsai and Nelson, 35Tsai C.-Y.

Science. 1992; 258: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been shown to be a heterotetramer composed of 2 distinct subunits both in higher plants and in Chlamydomonas (Iglesias et al., 10Iglesias A.A. Charng Y.Y. Ball S. Preiss J. Plant. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In most cases ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is activated by 3-phosphoglycerate and inhibited by orthophosphate (Ghosh and Preiss, 7Ghosh H.P. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4491-4504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (for review, see 29Preiss J. Denpun Kagaku. 1993; 40: 117-131Google Scholar and 30Preiss J. Sivak M.N. Zamski E. Schaffer A.A.

Starch in plants accumulates either in the chloroplast of the leaf cell during photosynthesis (photosynthetic starch) or in the amyloplast of non-photosynthetic storage organs (storage starch) (for reviews, see 31Shannon J.C.

Photoassimilate Distribution in Plants and Crops: Source-Sink Relationships. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 63Google Scholar). All structural investigations performed to date have dealt with storage starch. We have shown that growth-arrested (nitrogen-starved) Chlamydomonas cells accumulate a polysaccharide that bares a strong structural resemblance to maize endosperm storage starch (Ball et al., 1Ball S.G. Dirick L. Decq A. Martiat J.C. Matagne R.F. Plant Sci. 1990; 66: 1-9Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar; Fontaine et al., 5Fontaine T. D'Hulst C. Maddelein M.-L. Routier F. Marianne-Pepin T. Decq A.

Moreover we have demonstrated that it is synthesized by similar enzymes and that it responds in an identical fashion to mutations affecting these activities (Ball et al. 2Ball S. Marianne T. Dirick L. Fresnoy M. Delrue B. Decq A. Planta. 1991; 185: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Delrue et al. 4Delrue B. Fontaine T. Routier F. Decq A. Wieruszeski J.M. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Maddelein M.-L. Fournet B. Ball S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3612-3620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the starch accumulated during growth and photosynthesis differs markedly from storage starch (Libessart et al., 16Libessart N. Maddelein M.-L. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polysaccharide harbors little or no amylose and the amylopectin displays an altered chain-length distribution. Moreover, storage starch synthesis requires an additional function encoded by the STA4 gene product (Libessart et al., 16Libessart N. Maddelein M.-L. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This function is not needed for starch synthesis during growth. We now demonstrate that the STA1 locus that we had previously reported to be necessary for allosteric regulation of this enzyme is an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase structural gene. We show that mutants at the STA1 locus accumulate during storage a polysaccharide whose structure and composition display precise phenocopies of photosynthetic starch. We further show that this is a general property of mutants defective for ADP glucose supply. We therefore conclude that unlike other biological polymers such as proteins or nucleic acids, storage polysaccharides can display wide variation in structure through control of substrate supply.

Phosphoglucomutase zymograms were incubated in a buffer containing Tris-HCl 200 mM, pH 8.0, 50 mM MgCl2, 20 mg·ml−1 Glc-1-P; 0.03 mg·ml−1 Glc-1,6-P2, 0.4 mg·ml−1 NAD, 0.2 mg·ml−1 NADP, 0.4 mg·ml−1 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, 0.2 mg·ml−1 phenazine methosulfate. Gels were incubated at 20°C in darkness for 15–60 min and immediately photographed. Soluble crude extracts were always prepared from late log phase cells (2.106 cells·ml−1) grown in high salts acetate under continuous light (80 µE·m−2·s−1). ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity was followed by four distinct assays. Crude extracts assays (synthesis or pyrophosphorolysis) can be found in Ball et al. (2Ball S. Marianne T. Dirick L. Fresnoy M. Delrue B. Decq A. Planta. 1991; 185: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphorolysis (assay A) and synthesis assays (assay B) that were used during and after purification are described in Iglesias et al. (10Iglesias A.A. Charng Y.Y. Ball S. Preiss J. Plant.

Ball S. Preiss J. Plant. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant enzymes from 30 g of frozen Chlamydomonas pellets were purified, respectively, 2033- and 1180-fold by four chromatographic steps (DEAE-Sepharose, Mono Q, Green A Dye-Ligand, Mono Q) with yields of 32 and 27%. In a second series of purifications, the mutant enzyme withstood only the first two chromatographic steps (DEAE-Sepharose and Mono Q) which gave a 160-fold purification and 8% yield. In both cases the mutant enzyme displayed identical kinetics. Other enzyme assays or zymograms of starch synthases, branching enzymes, phosphoglucomutases, and phosphorylases were previously described (Fontaine et al. (5Fontaine T. D'Hulst C. Maddelein M.-L.

Methylation of total starch was performed according to Delrue et al. (4Delrue B. Fontaine T. Routier F. Decq A. Wieruszeski J.M. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Maddelein M.-L. Fournet B. Ball S. J.

Isoamylase-mediated debranching of gel permeation chromatography-purified fractions was achieved as described previously (Libessart et al., 16Libessart N. Maddelein M.-L. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After completion of the debranching reaction, samples were kept at 80°C in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide to avoid retrogradation of the long glucans into insoluble material. Half of the debranched polysaccharide was subjected to TSK-HW-50(F) chromatography while the other sample half was subjected to high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) on a Carbo-Pac PA-100 column. Details of those procedures can be found in Libessart et al. (16Libessart N. Maddelein M.-L. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Matrix-associated laser desorptions have been measured on a Vision 2000 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT. Brennen) using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix (10 mg ml−1 in MeCN:H2O, 70:30), 1 µl of sample (1.5 µg·µl−1) was mixed with 1 µl of matrix solution on a stainless steel target. Desorption/ionization was performed using a N2 laser at 337 nm. 20 spectra have been summed in order to enhance the signal to noise ratio. NMR analysis was performed as described in Fontaine et al. (5Fontaine T. D'Hulst C. Maddelein M.-L. Routier F. Marianne-Pepin T. Decq A. Wieruszeski J.M. Delrue B. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Bossu J.P. Fournet B. Ball S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16223-16230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of branching was estimated by integration of the same regions of proton resonances of the mono- and disubstituted glucose (δ∼5.2 and 4.85 parts/million, respectively) (Gidley, 6Gidley M.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 139: 85-93Crossref Google Scholar). Methylation of total starch and of fractions dialyzed and freeze-dried after TSK-HW-75 chromatography was performed according to Paz Parente et al. (27Paz Parente J. Cardon P. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Ricart G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 141: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and adapted to starch analysis (Delrue et al., 4Delrue B. Fontaine T. Routier F. Decq A.

The branching percentage was assayed as the ratio of methyl ether derivatives of α(1→4)-linked Glc either to those of α(1→4)- and α(1→6)- linked Glc or to those of Glc in a terminal nonreducing position (Delrue et al., 4Delrue B. Fontaine T. Routier F. Decq A. Wieruszeski J.M. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Maddelein M.-L. Fournet B. Ball S. J.

Standard glass beads-mediated transformation (Kindle, 12Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) was performed on the cell wall deficient arginine requiring strain 330 with 1 µg of pARG7.2 carrying the wild-type arginosuccinate lyase gene. Transformants were selected by complementation of the arginine auxotrophy present in the recipient strain. The transformants were screened for starch structure and amount by spraying iodine directly on replica plates (Fontaine et al. (5Fontaine T. D'Hulst C. Maddelein M.-L. Routier F. Marianne-Pepin T. Decq A. Wieruszeski J.M. Delrue B. Van Den Koornhuyse N. Bossu J.P. Fournet B. Ball S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16223-16230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those mutants that stained yellow contained less than 5% of the wild-type starch amount. They were selected and subjected to routine complementation analysis. The frequency of mutant selection in the starch pathway was in the order of 4 × 10−4. Algal DNA extraction was as described by Weeks et al. (38Weeks D.P. Beerman N. Griffith O.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). RNA extraction and purification was adapted from phenol extraction procedure described in Maniatis et al. (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Cloning of the large subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was performed using a λ EXlox (109 plaque-forming units·ml−1) library. The oligonucleotides 5′-AAG AT(CT) TAC GT(ACGT) CT(GT) AC(GTC) GAG TT-3′ and the antisense 5′-(GAC)GT (AG)CC (AG)AT (AG)T(CT) CTC CCA GTAT-3′generated a 650-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment that was used to rescreen the library. Five positive clones were then partly or fully sequenced. All clones displayed extensive sequence overlap. Subclones were generated either by the use of standard restriction sites or by that of ExoIII. The rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction kit from Perkin-Elmer was used to generate the 5′ end of the cDNA sequence. The amplification was performed using the 5′-GGC ATC AGC AAG ATC TA-3′ antisense nucleotide corresponding to the GTRLFP peptide. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The EMBL accession number for the sequence reported and used in this study is X91736. We had previously characterized the sta1-1 mutant allele as leading to a lower sensitivity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase to the allosteric effectors 3PGA and orthophosphate (Ball et al., 2Ball S. Marianne T. Dirick L. Fresnoy M. Delrue B. Decq A. Planta. 1991; 185: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To confirm these conclusions we purified the mutant activity from 95- to 1180-fold and made kinetic comparisons with the wild-type enzyme that was purified to homogeneity. Results shown in Fig. 1B clearly show that the mutant enzyme activity is less sensitive to 3PGA activation. However in contrast to what was initially reported for crude extracts (Ball et al., 2Ball S. Marianne T. Dirick L. Fresnoy M. Delrue B. Decq A. Planta. 1991; 185: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it remained sensitive to orthophosphate inhibition (Fig. 1A). The mutant S0.5 values measured in the presence of 2.5 mM 3PGA were 0.25 mM and 0.15 mM for ATP and Glc-1-P, respectively. These values, which are in the physiological range for ADP-glucose synthesis, are significantly higher than those reported for the wild-type activity in the presence of 2.5 mM 3PGA (S0.5 for ATP and Glc-1-P, were of 0.08 mM and 0.03 mM, respectively). However, they remain very close to those of the wild-type unactivated enzyme (S0.5 for ATP and Glc-1-P of 0.48 and 0.22, respectively) (Iglesias et al., 10Iglesias A.A. Charng Y.Y. Ball S. Preiss J. Plant. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, no significant decrease in the amount of total activity (in the absence of 3PGA) was found in crude extracts. In order to understand if these defects were specific of the x-ray generated sta1-1 allele, we selected gene disruptions of the STA1 locus. Strain BAFJ3 carrying the sta1-2::ARG7 disrupted allele failed to complement sta1-1 in diploids (Fig. 2). The disrupted strain showed the same phenotype as the original sta1-1 carrying mutants. It contained 5% of the wild-type starch amounts while ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase became selectively unresponsive to 3PGA activation.Fig. 2Phenotypes of wild-type and mutant haploid and diploid strains. The genotypes corresponding to each haploid or diploid strain with respect to starch are listed between parentheses. ZC1 and 137C are, respectively, wild-type diploid and haploid references. ZC21 is a diploid strain generated for the complementation test between NV314 (sta1-1) and BAFJ3 (sta1-2::ARG7). Cell patches were incubated for 5 days on solid nitrogen-deprived medium and sprayed twice with iodine vapors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lower sensitivity to 3PGA activation could be explained either by the absence of a regulatory protein responsible for switching the enzyme to a sensitive form or the absence or modification of one of the two subunits of the Chlamydomonas heterotetramer enzyme. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we have cloned and sequenced a full-length ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit cDNA. Southern analysis using the PvuII fragment in the middle of the cDNA coding sequences showed that all strains carrying sta1 deletions displayed major alterations (Fig. 3). Moreover, the size of the smallest fragments that appeared modified confirm that enzyme coding sequences are altered in the mutants. In addition Southern analysis was carried out on the meiotic progeny of a cross between I7 and wild-type strain 37, establishing cosegregation between the altered response and the mutant phenotype. While the results prove that STA1 encodes an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase subunit sequence, they do not distinguish yet between loci encoding large or small subunits of the enzyme. Both sta1-1 and sta1-2::ARG7 carrying strains contain highly selective defects. We have assayed the level and whenever possible the kinetics of all enzymes known to be involved in starch metabolism in the mutant strains. We found no indirect effect of the drop of nucleotide sugar supply on enzymes involved in starch metabolism. Total levels of GBSS, the enzyme known to be responsible for amylose biosynthesis, expressed per 106 cells showed a mere 2–3-fold reduction (Table I). However, a spectacular increase of this enzyme-specific activity expressed per µg of starch comes as as a consequence of the decrease in polysaccharide amounts (Table I and Fig. 4). Despite this increase, the decrease in the λmax (from 600 to 570 nm) of the iodine polysaccharide complex of purified starch granules suggested a large decrease in amylose content. The chromatograms displayed in Fig. 5 clearly show the absence of low molecular weight amylose in the residual starch stored by nitrogen starved sta1 carrying strains. In fact the storage polysaccharide chromatograms from the mutants are exact phenocopies of those of photosynthetic starch extracted from nitrogen supplied wild-type cultures. The absence of a contaminating amylose fraction in the purified amylopectin was confirmed by methylation analysis performed on unfractionated starch samples. Table II clearly shows that the starch from sta1 carrying mutants contain slightly more branches (6%) than mutants defective for amylose biosynthesis. The λmax of the high molecular weight amylopectin purified in these chromatograms displayed a small increase in the mutants. We therefore embarked in a more detailed structural characterization of the mutant amylopectin.Table I.Granule-bound starch synthase activity in wild-type and sta1-1 carrying strainsActivityStrainGenotypePer mg of starchPer 106 cellsVmaxanmol of ADP glucose incorporated into glucan per min per mg starch or per 106 cells.137C(+)3.282I7(sta1-1)1833a nmol of ADP glucose incorporated into glucan per min per mg starch or per 106 cells.

The wild-type haploid 137C strain starch extracted from nitrogen-starved cultures (storage starch) (panel A) can be seen to carry the standard type I (ApI) and type II (ApII) amylopectins and amylose (Am). Panel B displays starch from the same strain extracted from nitrogen-supplied growing and photosynthesizing cultures (photosynthetic starch). Panel C displays the starch extracted from a nitrogen-starved sta1-2::ARG7- carrying strain (BAFJ3). Panel D shows the starch extracted from nitrogen-starved I7 cells containing the sta1-1 mutation. Identical conclusions were reached using CL2B Sepharose in 10 mM NaOH. No amylose could be extracted from sta1 (both sta1-1 and sta1-2::ARG7)-carrying strains whatever solvent or pretreatment was used.

To test whether cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) participates in trans-Golgi pH regulation, intraluminal trans-Golgi pH was measured in stably transfected Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (expressing CFTR or ΔF508-CFTR) and CFTR-expressing and nonexpressing epithelial cells. trans-Golgi pH was measured by ratio-imaging confocal microscopy using a liposome injection procedure to label the lumen of trans-Golgi with fluid phase fluorescein and rhodamine chromophores (Seksek, O., Biwersi, J., and Verkman, A.

https://openalex.org/W2159316425,"Clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages is a crucial event following the resolution of acute inflammation. CD36, together with αvβ3, has been identified as one of the adhesion molecules on the surface of macrophages implicated in the clearance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The domain on CD36 implicated in the phagocytosis of aged neutrophils remains to be elucidated. In this study, COS cells transfected with human CD36 cDNA had a significantly higher capacity to phagocytose human apoptotic neutrophils compared with murine CD36 cDNA. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies 10/5 or OKM5 (epitopes identified on amino acids 155–183) but not monoclonal antibody 13/10 (epitope identified on amino acids 30–76) inhibited phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by COS cells transfected by human CD36. Swapping the human CD36 155–183 domain from human to murine CD36 (human-murine CD36 chimera) imparted to murine CD36-transfected COS cells an increased capacity to phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils. Conversely, when the murine domain 155–183 was inserted in human CD36, a decreased phagocytic capacity was observed. In addition, a synthetic peptide (155–169) but not its scrambled form significantly inhibited phagocytosis. These results identify for the first time a functional domain encompassing amino acids 155–183 on human CD36 implicated in the recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. Clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages is a crucial event following the resolution of acute inflammation. CD36, together with αvβ3, has been identified as one of the adhesion molecules on the surface of macrophages implicated in the clearance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The domain on CD36 implicated in the phagocytosis of aged neutrophils remains to be elucidated. In this study, COS cells transfected with human CD36 cDNA had a significantly higher capacity to phagocytose human apoptotic neutrophils compared with murine CD36 cDNA. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies 10/5 or OKM5 (epitopes identified on amino acids 155–183) but not monoclonal antibody 13/10 (epitope identified on amino acids 30–76) inhibited phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by COS cells transfected by human CD36.

INTRODUCTIONCD36 is a 88-kDa multifunctional adhesive glycoprotein expressed by platelets, monocytes, microvascular endothelial cells, mammary epithelial cells, erythroblasts, and several tumor cell lines (1Greenwalt D.E. Liosky R.H. Ockenhouse C.F. Ikeda H. Tandon N.N. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1992; 80: 1105-1115Google Scholar). It has been identified as one of the receptors for collagen type I (2Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Google Scholar) and thrombospondin (TSP) 1The abbreviations used are: TSPthrombospondinaPMNapoptotic polymorphonuclear leukocytesDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumhCD36human CD36mAbmonoclonal antibodymCD36mouse CD36PMNpolymorphonuclear leukocyte(s).

Moreover, CD36 mediates the cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to brain post capillary venular endothelium, a factor that contributes to the pathogenicity of the P. falciparum malaria (5Oquendo P. Hundt E. Lawler J. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 58: 95-101Google Scholar). Recently CD36 has been shown to act as a receptor for oxidized low density lipoproteins, and thus, it may be implicated in the evolution of atherosclerosis (6Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Google Scholar). This adhesion molecule has also been reported to act as a signaling molecule capable of mediating an oxidative burst in monocytes (7Schuepp B.J. Pfister H. Clemetson K.J. Silverstein R.L. Jungi T.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 263-270Google Scholar) and activated platelets (8Ockenhouse C.F. Magowan C. Chulay J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 468-475Google Scholar) by a process that may be associated with tyrosine phosphorylation (9Huang M.-M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shatill S.J. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7844-7848Google Scholar). Recent observations show that E-selectin, expressed by activated endothelial or transfected L cells, is capable of significantly increase the number of CD36 molecules expressed by monocytes (10Huh H.Y. Lo S.K. Yesner L.M. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6267-6271Google Scholar).Clearance of apoptotic or senescent neutrophils (PMN) by macrophages is a crucial process in events such as hemostasis, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. Indeed, efficient macrophage phagocytosis of senescent neutrophils undergoing constitutive apoptosis is likely to be critical for successful resolution of inflammatory responses (11Savill J. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 24: 715-723Google Scholar). To prevent damage to surrounding tissues, PMN undergo spontaneously apoptosis or programmed cell death (12Haslett C. Clin. Sci. 1992; 83: 639-648Google Scholar), which leads to recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages (13Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.H. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 865-875Google Scholar). CD36, together with the αvβ3 integrin, has been identified as one of the adhesion molecules on the surface of macrophages implicated in the clearance of PMN (14Savill J. Hogg N. Ren Y. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Google Scholar). Apoptotic T cells, following the resolution of viral infections, are also recognized by these two adhesion molecules (15Akbar A.N. Savill J. Gombert W. Bofill M. Borthwick N.J. Whitelaw F. Janossy G. Salmon M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1943-1947Google Scholar). Although increasing evidence supports the role of CD36 in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, very little is known concerning the structural domain on the CD36 molecule implicated in this recognition process. The epitope for the mAbs that blocked phagocytosis of apoptotic PMN (14Savill J. Hogg N. Ren Y. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Google Scholar, 16Ren Y. Silverstein R.L. Allen J. Savill J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1857-1862Google Scholar) was recently located in our laboratory to a region on CD36 encompassing amino acids 155–183 (17Daviet L. Buckland R. Puente Navazo M.D. McGregor J.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 303: 221-224Google Scholar). In this study, human-murine chimeric CD36 constructs together with anti-CD36 mAbs and peptides derived from this region were used to show the functional role of the 155–183 domain.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe cDNA coding for human and mouse CD36 were generously given by Dr Brian Seed (5Oquendo P. Hundt E. Lawler J. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 58: 95-101Google Scholar) and Dr. Gerda Endemann (6Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Google Scholar), respectively. LipofectAMINE reagent was from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Life Technologies, Inc. The COS-7 cell line was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). Culture media and supplements were from Life Technologies, Inc. Other reagents were from different sources and were of the highest purity available.Monoclonal AntibodiesAnti-CD36 monoclonal antibodies 10/5 and 13/10, were produced in our laboratory using for immunization a CD36-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus (18Daviet L. Craig A.G. McGregor L. Reck M.-P. Wild T.F. Berendt A.R. Newbold C.I. McGregor J.L. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 1141Google Scholar). 2L. Daviet, A. G. Craig, L. McGregor, M.-P. Reck, T. F. Wild, A. R. Berendt, C. I. Newbold, and J. L. McGregor, manuscript in preparation. These antibodies were further characterized by immunoprecipitation, Western blots, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of human platelets. mAbs 10/5 and 13/10 were found to be IgG2a and IgG2b, respectively, as determined by the Amersham isotyping kit (Amersham International). They were used as purified immunoglobulins. OKM5 was from Ortho (Raritan, NJ). LYP18, an anti-αvβ3 mAb, was produced in our laboratory (19Dechavanne M. French M. Pages J. French P. Boukerche H. Bryon P.A. McGregor J.L. Thromb. Haemost. 1987; 57: 106-109Google Scholar). As controls, different irrelevant immunoglobulins were used: mouse total IgG (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK), LYP20, an IgG1 directed against human P-selectin (20Parmentier S. McGregor L. Catimel B. Leung L.L.K. McGregor J.L. Blood. 1991; 77: 1734-1739Google Scholar), and a nonimmune IgG2a (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK). A polyclonal anti-CD36 human serum (anti-Naka) (21Daviet L. Morel-Kopp M.-C. Kaplan C. McGregor J.L. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 543-545Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Prof. Y. Shibata (Toranomon hospital, Tokyo, Japan).CD36 ConstructsChimeric proteins were generated by introduction of endonuclease sites into the human and mouse cDNA without altering the coding sequence as described (17Daviet L. Buckland R. Puente Navazo M.D. McGregor J.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 303: 221-224Google Scholar). Human and murine cDNA cloned in the eukaryotic vector pCDM8 were digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease to allow exchange of sequences between these two species and the ligation products transformed into E. coli MC1061/P3.PeptidesLinear peptides derived from the CD36 sequence were synthesized by Neosystems (Strasbourg, France) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography to a purity of >95% as analyzed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. The numbering of the peptides corresponds to amino acid sequence of CD36 and is as follows: 148–164, YQNQFVQMILNSLINL, and 155–169, MILNSLINKSKSSM. Control peptide for region 155–169 was identical to the authentic peptide, except that its sequence was scrambled. Stock solutions (14 mM) were prepared in water, and appropriate dilutions were made in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 10% autologous serum, just before each experiment.COS Cell TransfectionCOS cells monolayers cultured in 60-mm diameter dishes at 70% confluence were transfected with 2 µg of DNA and 6 µl of LipofectAMINE in DMEM according to the manufacturer's instructions.Following 24 h of transfection, the cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended with DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, seeded into 24-well plates (105 cells/well), and cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum for an additional period of 24 h. After 48 h of transfection, the expression of CD36 in the transfected cells was tested by anti-CD36 mAbs and flow cytometry with a FACSscan® using a LysisII software.CellsNeutrophils (>98% pure, Wright-Giemsa) were isolated from fresh, citrated blood from healthy donors, by dextran sedimentation and platelet-poor plasma Percoll density gradient centrifugation, aged for 24 h at 37°C, 5% C02 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% autologous platelet-rich plasma-derived serum. Apoptosis following 24 h of incubation was assessed in cytocentrifuge preparations stained with Wright-Giemsa (14Savill J. Hogg N. Ren Y. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Google Scholar). Human monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared by standard methods from adherent blood mononuclear cells by culture for 8 days in 24-well plates in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% autologous platelet-rich plasma-derived serum, as described (14Savill J. Hogg N. Ren Y. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Google Scholar).Phagocytosis AssaysFollowing 48 h of transfection, COS cells were washed with DMEM and then apoptotic PMN (aPMN) were added to the wells (2.5 × 106 aPMN/well). Following coincubation between the transfected cells and aPMN for 3 h at 37°C, in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 10% autologous platelet-rich plasma-derived serum, noningested apoptotic neutrophils were then washed with cold DMEM. Subsequently, cells were detached with 150 µl of trypsin/EDTA, and a cytocentrifuge preparation was made from each well. These were then fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, stained for myeloperoxidase to reveal ingested apoptotic neutrophils, and counterstained with Haemalum. The proportion of COS cells ingesting aPMN was assessed microscopically by counting 200 COS cells/slide.Effects of Monoclonal AntibodiesMonocyte-derived macrophages or transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with mAbs (final concentration, 50 µg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with 2 ml of DMEM followed by the addition of 2.5 × 106 aPMN/well. Phagocytosis assay was carried out as above.Effect of PeptidesThe effect of CD36-derived peptides on the phagocytosis of aPMN by monocyte-derived macrophages or hCD36-transfected COS cells was determined using the standard protocol with peptides being added to the PMN suspension at the concentration indicated prior to its addition to the COS cell monolayer.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have identified, for the first time, an important functional domain on CD36 involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. The role of this domain in mediating phagocytosis of human apoptotic neutrophils, in tandem with αvβ3, is supported by a number of lines of evidence: 1) COS cells transfected with mCD36 were observed to have a minimal capacity to phagocytose human aPMN compared with hCD36. Inserting the human CD36 155–183 domain into mCD36 imparts to the chimeric CD36 a capacity to phagocytose aPMN. 2) Conversely, inserting the mCD36 155–183 domain in the hCD36 abolishes its phagocytic capacity. 3) Monoclonal antibodies directed against the 155–183 domain but not mAbs directed toward the N-terminal domain block phagocytosis. 4) A peptide derived from hCD36 amino acids 155–169 but not its scrambled form blocks phagocytosis.A recent study has shown that the functional repertoire of human CD36 includes the capacity to promote, together with αvβ3, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells on COS and Bowes melanoma cells (16Ren Y. Silverstein R.L. Allen J. Savill J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1857-1862Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that the cooperation of CD36 and the αvβ3 integrin is crucial for recognition and phagocytosis of aPMN (22Savill J. Dransfield I. Hogg N. Haslett C. Nature. 1990; 343: 170-173Google Scholar, 23Savill J. Silverstein R. Ren Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6: 852Google Scholar, 24Dransfield I. Haslett C. Savill J. Tissue Antigens. 1993; 42: 416Google Scholar). Our results are in line with these findings but also show that mCD36 cDNA does not have the same capacity as hCD36, when transfected in COS cells expressing αvβ3, to phagocytose human apoptotic neutrophils. Indeed, it is of interest to note that human and murine macrophages may use different receptors for the recognition and phagocytosis of aPMN (25Fadok V.A. Laszlo D.J. Noble P.W. Weinstein L. Riches D.W.H. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 151: 4274-4285Google Scholar). Differences in phagocytosis capacity of COS cells, resulting from wild type human or murine CD36 transfection, together with epitope mapping of blocking mAbs have allowed us to identify a domain (amino acids 155–183) on hCD36 implicated in the recognition and internalization of aPMN.The 155–183 domain is adjacent to a region encompassing amino acids 139–155 that has been reported to represent a part of the OKM5 epitope and that is implicated in the initial binding to TSP (26Leung L.L.K. Li W.-X. McGregor J.L. Albrecht G. Howard R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18244-18250Google Scholar). It is important to note that domain 139–155 is identical in both the human and mouse proteins with the exception of residues 146 and 152 (17Daviet L. Buckland R. Puente Navazo M.D. McGregor J.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 303: 221-224Google Scholar). Thus, phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils is dependent on the 155–183 region, but residues in the adjacent 139–155 sequence may be important as well as observed for mAb binding (17Daviet L. Buckland R. Puente Navazo M.D. McGregor J.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 303: 221-224Google Scholar, 26Leung L.L.K. Li W.-X. McGregor J.L. Albrecht G. Howard R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18244-18250Google Scholar). Strong evidence is available to show that interaction between aPMN- and monocyte-derived macrophages or CD36-transfected cell lines is mediated by TSP (14Savill J. Hogg N. Ren Y. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Google Scholar, 16Ren Y. Silverstein R.L. Allen J. Savill J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1857-1862Google Scholar). According to the two step model of Leung et al. (26Leung L.L.K. Li W.-X. McGregor J.L. Albrecht G. Howard R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18244-18250Google Scholar), the 139–155 domain might be implicated in the initial binding of TSP that would consequently give rise to a high affinity binding site (amino acids 93–110) on CD36. Exposition of this second site allows further consolidation of the CD36-TSP interaction. Human TSP, in the same way as blocking mAbs, may initially interact with CD36 via a discontinuous site involving amino acids 139–155 and 155–183 domains. Replacing the 155–183 domain, in human CD36, by its murine homologue may either affect the stability of the TSP-CD36 interaction and/or the transmission of necessary outside-in signals (9Huang M.-M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shatill S.J. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7844-7848Google Scholar) to the macrophage and prevent the recognition and phagocytosis of aPMN. Alternatively, any changes in the sequence of 155–183, from human to murine, may locally affect the conformation of CD36 and consequently alter its capacity of phagocytosis. A peptide (155–169) derived from region 155–183 inhibits, in contrast to its scrambled form or a peptide derived from region 148–164, phagocytosis of aPMN by hCD36-transfected COS cells. Differences in functional reactivity between these two peptides may conceivably be due to one (155–169) but not the other (148–164), acquiring a conformation that is closer to the native state of this region. The work of Asch et al. implicates amino acids 87–99 in the binding of TSP and shows that this binding is linked to the phosphorylation of Thr92 (27Asch A.S. Liu I. Briccetti J.W. Barnwell F.M. Kwakye-Berko F. Dokun A. Goldberger J. Pernambuco M. Science. 1993; 262: 1436-1440Google Scholar). Moreover, the group of Silverstein uses recombinant proteins to show the role of the 93–120 domain in binding TSP (28Pearce S.F.A. Wu J. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2981-2986Google Scholar). The current hypothesis, modified following results obtained in this study, would suggest that TSP interacts in a first stage with a conformational site on CD36, represented by region 139–183, prior to its binding to a high affinity site most probably represented by region 87–120 (26Leung L.L.K. Li W.-X. McGregor J.L. Albrecht G. Howard R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18244-18250Google Scholar).The data presented in this study indicate that the functional domain encompassing amino acids 155–183 plays a critical role in the phagocytosis of aPMN. Moreover, recent data from our laboratory suggest that region 155–183 is a multifunctional domain implicated as well in the cytoadherence of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes to CD36 (29Aiken M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Byers-Wardand V. Plow E.F. Blood. 1990; 76: 2501-2509Google Scholar), as a signaling molecule implicated in inducing platelet aggregation and secretion (18Daviet L. Craig A.G. McGregor L. Reck M.-P. Wild T.F. Berendt A.R. Newbold C.I. McGregor J.L. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 1141Google Scholar) and in oxidized LDL binding (30Puente Navazo M.D. Daviet L. Ninio E. McGregor Blood. 1995; 86: 1490Google Scholar). The domain 155–183 is coded by a single exon (exon VI) (31Armesilla A.L. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18985-18991Google Scholar), and it is possible that this exon delineates an independent, structural, and functional domain of human CD36, directly implicated in cell-cell interactions. INTRODUCTIONCD36 is a 88-kDa multifunctional adhesive glycoprotein expressed by platelets, monocytes, microvascular endothelial cells, mammary epithelial cells, erythroblasts, and several tumor cell lines (1Greenwalt D.E.

https://openalex.org/W2065829956,"Cell proliferation requires the co-ordinate triggering of several protein kinases of Ser/Thr specificity such as p70 S6 kinase (S6K), which phosphorylates the ribosomal S6 protein and thus increases translation of mRNAs with polypyrimidine tracts. The multiplicity of signaling pathways leading to p70 S6K activation are not fully elucidated. However, several reports have indicated that the activation of p70 S6K is independent of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Interestingly, we and others have shown that constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway promotes cell proliferation, suggesting that this cascade is able to activate p70 S6K, a key step to trigger cell cycle entry. In this report we demonstrate that transfection of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 in CCL 39 cells leads to activation of p70 S6K. Furthermore, we have established a cell line that stably expresses ΔRaf-1:ER, an estradiol-regulated form of oncogenic Raf-1. The addition of estradiol to these cells was sufficient to elicit rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, MAPK, and p70 S6K. Surprisingly, the activation of p70 S6K is not mediated by MAPK because blocking MAPK activation by expression of the phosphatase MKP-1 did not prevent p70 S6K activation by ΔRaf-1:ER. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that activation of p70 S6K by ΔRaf-1:ER is mediated by a new MAPK-independent pathway. This pathway is resistant to low nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin, indicating that it does not involve membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate kinase activation. Cell proliferation requires the co-ordinate triggering of several protein kinases of Ser/Thr specificity such as p70 S6 kinase (S6K), which phosphorylates the ribosomal S6 protein and thus increases translation of mRNAs with polypyrimidine tracts. The multiplicity of signaling pathways leading to p70 S6K activation are not fully elucidated. However, several reports have indicated that the activation of p70 S6K is independent of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Interestingly, we and others have shown that constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway promotes cell proliferation, suggesting that this cascade is able to activate p70 S6K, a key step to trigger cell cycle entry. In this report we demonstrate that transfection of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 in CCL 39 cells leads to activation of p70 S6K. Furthermore, we have established a cell line that stably expresses ΔRaf-1:ER, an estradiol-regulated form of oncogenic Raf-1. The addition of estradiol to these cells was sufficient to elicit rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, MAPK, and p70 S6K. Surprisingly, the activation of p70 S6K is not mediated by MAPK because blocking MAPK activation by expression of the phosphatase MKP-1 did not prevent p70 S6K activation by ΔRaf-1:ER. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that activation of p70 S6K by ΔRaf-1:ER is mediated by a new MAPK-independent pathway. This pathway is resistant to low nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin, indicating that it does not involve membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate kinase activation. Activation of cell proliferation by hormones and growth factors has been shown to correlate with the intracellular activation of several interacting protein kinases cascades (reviewed in 1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). One of the kinases activated rapidly by all mitogens is the p70/p85 S6 kinase (reviewed in 2Thomas G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 3Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which leads to phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and increases the rate of translation of mRNAs containing a polypyrimidine tract (4Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the S6 kinase mRNA leads to the synthesis of two distinct proteins with molecular masses of 70 or 85 kDa. These isoforms have the same substrate specificity in vitro and seem to be activated similarly; thus for convenience they will be referred to collectively as p70 S6K. 1The abbreviations used are: S6KS6 kinasePI3Kphosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate kinaseERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMKK1mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1MKP-1mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1MOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPDGFplatelet-derived growth factor. The first clue indicating that activation of p70 S6 kinase is essential for triggering cell growth came from the discovery that it was the target of the immunosuppressant drug rapamycin (5Price D.J. Grove R.J. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 6Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), which blocks cell growth. This was confirmed independently by Thomas' group, who showed that micro-injection of antibodies raised against p70 S6K blocked DNA synthesis (7Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). S6 kinase phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate kinase estrogen receptor fetal calf serum mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis platelet-derived growth factor. A major advance to unveil the signaling cascade leading to p70 S6K activation came recently from the work of Weng et al., which showed that constitutively active PI3K activates indirectly p70 S6K by phosphorylation of its threonine 252 (8Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). One of the intermediate kinases may be Akt (PKB), because it was shown to be activated by PI3K and constitutively active Akt (PKB) activates p70 S6K (9Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). However, p70 S6K can be stimulated by O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate without PI3K activation (10Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); furthermore mutation of tyrosine 740 of the PDGF receptor abolishes the activation of PI3K in transfected 293 cells but does not alter the stimulation of p70 S6K by PDGF (11Ming X.-F. Burgering B.M. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems that several signaling pathways are able to activate p70 S6K. An additional class of protein kinases rapidly activated by all mitogens are the p42/p44 MAPK. Previous work from our group has demonstrated that activation of p42/p44 MAPK is an absolute requirement for fibroblasts to progress from G0 to S-phase. This was shown by expressing either p44 MAPK antisense or dominant-negative MAPK (p44 MAPK-TA) mutant (12Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Méloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). p42/p44 MAPK is activated by direct phosphorylation by MKK1 (13Alessi D. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), which itself is phosphorylated and activated by Raf (reviewed in 14Schlessinger J.

Prog. Growth. Factor Res. 1994; 5: 291-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Raf is recruited to the membrane by Ras upon activation of either G protein-coupled receptors (17van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) or tyrosine kinase receptors (18Clark S.G. Stern M.J. Horvitz R.H. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Activation of p42/p44 MAPK induces pleiotropic effects (reviewed in 16L'Allemain G. Prog. Growth. Factor Res. 1994; 5: 291-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) ranging from the phosphorylation of membrane bound proteins such as c-phospholipase A2 (19Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar) to the activation of transcription factors such as Elk-1 (20Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) following nuclear translocation of both p42 and p44 isoforms (21Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we and others have shown that permanent activation of the p42/44 MAPK pathway upon expression of a constitutively active form of MKK1 (MKK1-SSDD) promotes cell cycle entry and oncogenicity (22Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar, 24Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. VandeWoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that this cascade should activate all the steps necessary to trigger cell proliferation, such as activation of p70 S6K. Indeed, the first experiment of this report will show that transfection of MKK1-SSDD is sufficient to activate p70 S6K. This result is in accordance with the observation that v-Ras transformed cells have increased phosphorylation of S6 due to p70 S6K activation (25Blenis J. Erikson R.L. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 966-969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is in contradiction with several studies that led to the conclusion that the MAPK and p70 S6K signaling pathways are independent. It was shown that firstly MAPK does not phosphorylate in vitro p70 S6K (26Ballou L.M. Luther H. Thomas G. Nature. 1991; 349: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), secondly some agonists that fully activate MAPK have little or no effect on the activation of p70 S6K and vice versa (26Ballou L.M. Luther H. Thomas G. Nature. 1991; 349: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), thirdly the transfection of a dominant negative form of Ras prevents MAPK activation by epidermal growth factor or O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate without affecting p70 S6K activation (11Ming X.-F. Burgering B.M. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and fourthly, transfection of dominant negative mSOS1 is able to block insulin-mediated activation of Ras and of MAPK but has no effect on p70 S6K stimulation (27Sakaue M. Bowtell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The activation of p70 S6K by the constitutively active form of MKK1 that we report could be due to the triggering of an autocrine loop. In order to exclude this possibility we have examined the activity of p70 S6K following the rapid activation of the Raf-MAPK cascade through an estradiol-regulated form of oncogenic Raf-1 (28Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 29Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Raf-1 is capable of activating p70 S6K by a MAPK-independent pathway. Wortmannin, estradiol, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and myelin basic protein were obtained from Sigma. Thrombin was kindly provided by Dr. J. W. Fenton II (New York State Department of Health, Albany NY), and [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN; ECL and Hybond C extra supported membranes were from Radiochemical Centre (Amersham Corp.). Protein A-Sepharose CL4B was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; 12CA5 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the HA epitope was from BABCO (Emeryville, CA). P5D4 monoclonal antibody against the VSVG epitope (30Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. B. Gould, Institut Pasteur, Paris; 9E10 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the Myc epitope was provided by Dr. G. Evan, ICRF London. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. The polyclonal antibody M5 that immunoprecipitates specifically p70 S6K and the p70 S6K substrate (Ribosomal S6 protein) was kindly provided by Dr. G. Thomas (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland). Dr. F. R. McKenzie kindly provided the rabbit antibody that recognizes specifically p42 and p44 MAPK on Western blot (E1B, directed against the peptide coding for the 14 amino acids of the C-terminal end of hamster p44-MAPK) and the rabbit antibody that immunoprecipitates MAPK (Kelly, directed against bacterially produced GST-hamster p44 MAPK). The rabbit antibody that immunoprecipitates specifically MKK1 (MKK16) is identical to that previously reported (21Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster Lung fibroblasts CCL39 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (H21 reference number 52100, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mM NaHCO3. The derived CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER clone was maintained in H21 medium without phenol red, supplemented with glutamine and glucose to reach the concentrations of normal H21 (H21 without phenol red, reference number 11880). Both culture medium were supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 µg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. The CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER clonal cell line was obtained by transfection of CCL39 cells with the plasmid pLNCΔRaf-1:ER (28Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and selection of clones resistant to Geneticin (G418). The clone that displayed the highest stimulation of MAPK activity upon estradiol addition was selected and re-cloned. The plasmid p44 MAPK-VSVG is constructed from the hamster cDNA of p44 MAPK tagged with the VSVG epitope at its C terminus (21Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The plasmids p44 MAPK and p44 MAPK-T192A are derived from the hamster cDNA of p44 MAPK as described previously (12Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Méloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The plasmid p70 S6K-myc kindly provided by Dr. G. Thomas (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland) is constructed from the human cDNA of p70 S6K tagged with the Myc-9E10 epitope at its C terminus (31Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The human cDNA of the phosphatase MKP-1 kindly provided by Dr. S. Keyse (32Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) was subcloned in the expression vector pcDNAneo (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by J.-M. Brondello. The cells were stably transfected using the calcium phosphate method and selected in Geneticin (500 µg/ml). Cells were seeded at 7 × 105 in a 35-mm dish for transient transfection. 24 h later, cells were incubated for 6 h with the calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitate, the precipitate was removed, and the cells were allowed to recover for 12 h in presence of 7.5% FCS. Finally the cells were serum deprived for 24 h prior to subsequent stimulation. Confluent cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.1% Triton, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 40 mM paranitrophenylphosphate, and 200 µM orthovanadate). 25 µg of detergent-extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (29:1) and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C membranes and immuno-probed as described previously (33Méloche S. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). MKK1 activity was assayed as described previously (22Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the substrate is provided by immunoprecipitated p44 MAPK-HA from a nonstimulated over-expressor cell line. The substrate is incubated for 30 min with immunoprecipitated endogenous MKK1 (with the specific antibody MKK16 (21Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) at 30°C in presence of 30 µM ATP (3 µCi of [γ32P]ATP). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel). Measure of MAPK (33Méloche S. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and p70 S6K (34Reinhard C. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4052-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) activity was assayed as described previously: Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (120 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM EGTA, 15 mM NaPPi, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM orthovanadate). Cells remaining attached on the plate were scraped, and the extract was sonicated 30 s on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. 350 µl of the supernatant was incubated with the p70 S6K antibody, and 150 µl was incubated with the MAPK antibody. After 4 h of incubation with the specific antibody and protein A-Sepharose, the immune complex was washed five times in lysis buffer and one time in kinase buffer without substrate. Immunoprecipitated MAPK was incubated 20 min at 30°C in the following buffer: 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM paranitrophenylphosphate, 0.25 mg/ml myelin basic protein, and 30 µM ATP (3 µCi of [γ32P]ATP). Immunoprecipitated p70 S6K was incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the following buffer: 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM paranitrophenylphosphate, 30 µM ATP (3 µCi of [γ32P]ATP, and 2 mg/ml 40 S ribosomal subunit (35Lane H.A. Thomas G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 268-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that mutation of MKK1 on its two phosphorylation sites Ser218 and Ser222 to two aspartic residues (MKK1-SSDD) is sufficient to permanently activate p42/44 MAPK (22Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of MKK1-SSDD into the established cell line CCL39 (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts) increased the probability of cell cycle entry in the absence of exogenously added growth factors (22Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to analyze the effects of MKK1-SSDD on the activation of p70 S6K as activation of this protein kinase is required for cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 1, growth-arrested CCL39 cells co-transfected with MKK1-WT and epitope-tagged reporter kinases, display a low level of both p44 MAPK (see Fig. 3A) and p70 S6K (see Fig. 3B) activities (lane 1), whereas the addition of serum for 1 h markedly increased their activities (lane 2). Interestingly, serum-deprived cells (lane 3) co-transfected with MKK1-SSDD display an elevated level of p44 MAPK and p70 S6K activities equivalent to the levels reached by stimulation with 10% FCS for 1 h (lane 4). Hence, the expression of the constitutively active MKK1-SSDD is sufficient to promote activation of both p42/p44 MAPK and p70 S6K. The stimulation of p70 S6K by MKK1-SSDD could be either a primary effect mediated by its only known substrate p42/p44 MAPKs or a secondary effect due to the triggering of an autocrine loop subsequent to the persistent activation of the MAPK cascade. To resolve this question, we sought a means to conditionally and rapidly stimulate MAPK in vivo by acting downstream of membrane receptors. An interesting approach is provided by fusion of the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor to oncogenic forms of Raf kinases, which gives rise to fusion proteins whose activities are exquisitely controlled by the concentration of estradiol in the growth medium (28Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 29Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously in a variety of cell types, activation of ΔRaf-1:ER leads to the activation of MKK1 and MAPK minutes after the addition of estradiol to cells (28Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A stable clone of CCL39 cells expressing ΔRaf-1:ER was isolated and is hereafter referred to as CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER. The addition of estradiol to the parental cell line CCL39 did not affect the activity of MAPK nor p70 S6K, even at concentrations as high as 10 µM (data not shown). In contrast the addition of 1 µM of estradiol to CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER cell leads to the rapid activation of MKK1 activity, as can be seen by the increase in phosphorylation of its substrate p44 MAPK (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–8). The stimulation of MKK1 activity is detectable as early as 2 min following ΔRaf-1:ER activation (lane 4), reaches its maximum 15 min following agonist addition (lane 6) at a level comparable with that of serum stimulation (compare lane 2 and lane 6). The level of MKK1 activation following activation of ΔRaf-1:ER is maintained for at least 1 h (lane 8). In Fig. 2B, activation of ΔRaf-1:ER induces the mobility shift-up of both p42 and p44 MAPK in a time-dependent manner. This retardation of MAPK mobility in SDS-PAGE has been shown to result from phosphorylation of the two activation sites of MAPK and strictly correlates with MAPK activation (36Posada J. Cooper J.A. Science. 1992; 255: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The activation of MAPK is detected 5 min following activation of ΔRaf-1:ER (Fig. 2B, lane 4) and reaches its maximum 15 min later (lane 5). A number of experiments indicated that MAPK activation was maximal after 15–30 min. In most experiments, such as this one, the level of MAPK activation upon ΔRaf-1:ER activation is comparable with that observed following serum stimulation (Fig. 2B compare lanes 2 and 7) and persists for several hours (data not shown). Concentrations of estradiol as low as 10 nM elicited an upward mobility shift of p42 and p44 MAPK in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The maximal shift of MAPK is observed with concentrations of 100 nM or higher (data not shown). This effect is specific because the addition of estradiol to the parental CCL39 cell line does not affect MAPK activity (data not shown). The enzymatic activities of p44 MAPK (Fig. 3A) and p70 S6K (Fig. 3B) were measured in a single cell lysate obtained from CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER cells exposed to either 10% FCS or 1 µM estradiol for increasing periods of time. Induction of p44 MAPK activity following serum stimulation is rapid, reaching its maximum within 5 min (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Maximal activation persists for 60 min (Fig. 3A, lane 5) and decreases markedly 3 h post-stimulation (lane 6). The induction of p70 S6K activity by serum shows a similar profile; maximum activation is obtained 5 min following stimulation (Fig. 3B, lane 2) and remains activated for at least 3 h (Fig. 3B, lane 6). One must note that in this particular experiment, cells with high passage number were used, and the level of MAPK activation reached by ΔRaf-1:ER activation is lower than that obtained with serum (Fig. 3B, compare lane 9 with lane 3). Nonetheless ΔRaf-1:ER stimulates MAPK within 15 min, and it is worth emphasizing that ΔRaf-1:ER activation is sufficient to activate p70 S6K. This effect is detectable 30 min post-stimulation (Fig. 3B, lane 10). In this experiment the level of p70 S6K stimulation obtained by activation of ΔRaf-1:ER is lower than that obtained by serum (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 5 and 11, for example). In fact, the extent of p70 S6K activation by ΔRaf-1:ER compared with that obtained upon stimulation with FCS varied somewhat within experiments, but the appearance of p70 S6K activation by ΔRaf-1:ER activation was reproducibly detected within 30 min, and the extent of MAPK and p70 S6K activation seemed to be coordinated (data not shown). We compared the activation of MAPK and p70 S6K by ΔRaf-1:ER with that obtained by the stimulation with increasing amounts of FCS (Fig. 4). In several experiments such as this one (with cells of lower passage number than in Fig. 3), the level of MAPK activation reached by ΔRaf-1:ER activation is equivalent to stimulation with 10% FCS (Fig. 4A, compare lane 2 with lane 6). Surprisingly, the level of p70 S6K activity reached with ΔRaf-1:ER activation is only equivalent to the levels reached with stimulation by 0.3% FCS (Fig. 4B, compare lane 2 with lane 4). Thus activation of ΔRaf-1:ER stimulated MAPK more potently than p70 S6K relative to 10% FCS. Previous results demonstrate that activation of ΔRaf-1:ER is sufficient to increase p70 S6K activity. Presently, the only unambiguously defined substrates of Raf-1 are MKK1 and MKK2, which activate p42 and p44 MAPK (13Alessi D. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus Raf-1-mediated activation of p70 S6K could be a consequence of MAPK activation. In order to address this issue, we decided to test whether blocking MAPK activity would abrogate the ability of ΔRaf-1:ER to activate p70 S6K. As we published previously, inhibition of endogenous p42/p44 MAPK activity can be obtained by transient over-expression of the inactive p44-MAPK-T192A form (12Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Méloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5 we have assessed the effect of expression of the vector MAPK-T192A (20 µg) compared with the control vector MAPK, on the activity of the co-expressed reporter kinase p70 S6K-Myc (2 µg). Serum stimulation of p70 S6K-Myc activity is not affected by expression of the dominant-negative kinase p44 MAPK-T192A (Fig. 5, compare lane 2 with lane 5). This result is consistent with reports indicating that p70 S6K activation is independent from that of MAPK (11Ming X.-F. Burgering B.M. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Ballou L.M. Luther H. Thomas G. Nature. 1991; 349: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Similarly the level of p70 S6K stimulation by ΔRaf-1:ER activation is not impeded by expression of p44 MAPK-T192A (compare lanes 3 and 6). These results indicate that serum and ΔRaf-1:ER activation increase p70 S6K activity independently of MAPK activation. As an independent and perhaps more potent approach to block the MAPK cascade, we co-transfected the MAPK-specific phosphatase, MKP-1, in conjunction with the two reporter kinases p44 MAPK-VSVG and p70 S6K-Myc. MKP-1 has been shown in vivo and in vitro to dephosphorylate and inactivate MAP kinases (37Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). In cells co-transfected with the control vector (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3) estradiol or 10% FCS induced a marked activation of p44 MAPK-VSVG over control (compare lane 1 with lanes 2 or 3). However, the co-transfection of the phosphatase MKP-1 (Fig. 6A, lanes 4–6) reduced MAPK activity stimulated by ΔRaf-1:ER activation or 10% FCS nearly to control levels (compare lane 4 with lane 5 or 6). Interestingly, expression of MKP-1 reduced the basal level of p70 S6K activity in comparison with that obtained with the control transfection (Fig. 6B, compare lane 1 with lane 4). More importantly, expression of MKP-1 had no effect on the stimulation of p70 S6K by either ΔRaf-1:ER activation (Fig. 6B, lane 5) or by serum (lane 6). Clearly activation of p70 S6K by ΔRaf-1:ER still occurs despite the abolition of MAPK activation. Thus the activation of p70 S6K by Raf-1 is mediated by a MAPK-independent pathway. Does p70 S6K activation involve PI3K activation, one of the pathways that activate p70 S6K (38Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2073621782,"Relatively little is known regarding intracellular cholesterol trafficking pathways. To resolve some of these potential pathways, spontaneous and protein-mediated sterol transfer was examined between different donor-acceptor membrane pairs in vitro using L-cell fibroblast plasma membrane (PM) and microsomal (MICRO) and mitochondrial (MITO) membranes. Several new exciting insights were provided. First, the initial rate of spontaneous molecular sterol transfer was more dependent on the type of acceptor than donor membrane, i.e. spontaneous intracellular sterol trafficking was vectorial. Therefore, the rate of sterol desorption from the donor membrane was not necessarily the rate-limiting step in molecular sterol transfer. Second, the rate of molecular sterol transfer was not obligatorily correlated with the direction of the cholesterol gradient. For example, although PM had a 3.2-fold higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio than MITO, spontaneous sterol transfer was 4–5-fold faster up (MITO to PM) rather than down (PM to MITO) the concentration gradient. Third, sterol carrier protein-2 differentially stimulated the initial rate of sterol transfer for all donor-acceptor combinations, being most effective with PM donors: PM-MICRO, 27-fold; and PM-MITO, 12-fold. Sterol carrier protein-2 was less effective in enhancing sterol transfer in the reverse direction, i.e. MICRO-PM and MITO-PM (5- and 4-fold, respectively). Fourth, liver fatty acid-binding protein was limited in stimulating the initial rate of sterol transfer from PM to PM (1.5-fold), from PM to MITO (3-fold), and from MICRO to MITO (3-fold).

INTRODUCTIONSterols are essential components serving both structural and functional roles in mammalian cells. Sterols modulate membrane fluidity and thickness, thereby contributing to membrane passive permeability and activity of integral membrane proteins (1Yeagle P.L. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B.

Chem. 1981; 256: 2016-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, there appears to be synergism between cholesterol biosynthesis and synthesis of DNA, RNA, and phospholipids (9Cornell R.B. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Cornell R.B. Goldfein H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 504-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates such as isoprenoids are required for glycoprotein synthesis and the synthesis of ubiquinones (11Maltese W.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3319-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 12Edwards P.A. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 383Google Scholar).Cholesterol is not uniformly distributed in cells. Sterol synthetic activity in eukaryotic cells is concentrated in the relatively cholesterol-poor endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes (12Edwards P.A. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 383Google Scholar), whereas the plasma membrane accommodates the major part of intracellular sterol content (13Colbeau A. Nachbauer J.

Esfahani M. Swaney J.B. Advances In Cholesterol Research. Telford Press, Caldwell, NJ1990: 133Google Scholar). Consequently, extensive sterol transfer and targeting must occur between these intracellular membranes, either against or with the cholesterol gradient, respectively (4Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R.

Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite their importance to sterol homeostasis in the cell, the major pathways of intracellular sterol trafficking are still unclear.The vast majority of information on sterol transfer/exchange has focused on model membranes (4Schroeder F.

Thus, the first objective of this study was to explore spontaneous sterol trafficking between cellular components such as plasma, microsomal, and mitochondrial membranes. The second objective was to investigate the role of SCP-2 1The abbreviations used are: SCP-2sterol carrier protein-2L-FABPliver fatty acid-binding proteinDHEdehydroergosterol (Δ5,7,9,(11),22-ergostatetraen-3β-ol)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)PMplasma membrane(s)MICROmicrosomal membrane(s)MITOmitochondrial membrane(s). and L-FABP, cytosolic lipid transfer proteins, in targeting potential pathways of intracellular sterol trafficking.

Biochim. Biophys.

Jefferson J.R. Kier A.B. Knittel J. Scallen T.J. Wood W.G. Hapala I. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 196: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 43Liscum L. Underwood K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). One potential complication in studying cholesterol trafficking in intact cells is that multiple types of donor and acceptor membranes coexist and compete, thereby making it difficult to resolve individual components. In contrast, herein, an in vitro approach with different combinations of specific membrane marker-enriched membrane fractions isolated from L-cell fibroblasts in conjunction with a fluorescent molecular sterol transfer assay yielded several exciting new observations.Spontaneous sterol transfer occurs most rapidly between the cholesterol-rich plasma membranes as compared with relatively cholesterol-poor mitochondria. This surprising finding is complemented by data showing for the first time the existence and vectorial nature, at least in vitro, of the spontaneous intracellular sterol trafficking process. For example, sterol spontaneously moved down the cholesterol gradient from plasma membranes to microsomes almost three times faster than in the opposite direction. However, this trend of spontaneous sterol transfer down a concentration gradient cannot be applied uniformly. Spontaneous sterol transfer between mitochondrial and plasma membranes (MITO-PM), up the cholesterol gradient, was faster than down the gradient (PM-MITO). In short, spontaneous sterol transfer between dissimilar donor-acceptor pairs was obligatorily correlated with direction of the cholesterol gradient (e.g. PM-MITO versus MITO-PM and MICRO-MITO versus MITO-MICRO). Finally, not all intracellular pathways are equally available for rapid spontaneous movement of sterol. The PM-MITO, MICRO-PM, and MICRO-MITO transfer rates were extremely slow compared with the velocity observed for the other donor-acceptor combinations (Fig. 3).One of the classic assumptions in cholesterol transfer, based primarily on model membrane data, is that the rate of sterol transfer between membranes is limited by the rate of sterol desorption from the donor membrane, followed by diffusion of the sterol molecule through an aqueous space and its subsequent incorporation into the acceptor membrane (for review, see 19Phillips M.C. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar and 44Brown R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 3375-3389Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). If this were true for biomembranes, then different acceptors should not affect the rate of sterol transfer from the donor membrane. However, analysis of sterol movement in heterogeneous donor-acceptor pairs showed that the initial rate of sterol transfer was affected greatly by the nature of the acceptor. For example, replacement of the PM acceptor in the PM-PM combination by MICRO or MITO leads to 1.5- and 4.3-fold decreases in the initial sterol transfer rate, respectively (Table I). If the desorption of sterol molecules from the donor membrane was the rate-limiting step, the replacement of the acceptor membranes should have no effect on the process of intermembrane sterol transfer. These observations are consistent with recent model membrane data also showing that properties of both the donor and acceptor model membrane vesicles determine the rate of sterol and phospholipid transfer (45Schroeder F. Nemecz G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5992-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 46Gadella T.W.J. Wirtz K.W.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, these data do not support the commonly held assumption that the rate-limiting step in the process of sterol exchange between biomembranes is necessarily the rate of sterol desorption from a donor membrane. Therefore, in addition to the desorption rate, the nature of the acceptor membrane can have a significant role in this process.Another important observation made from this study is that SCP-2 is much more effective and has different specificity than L-FABP in enhancing the initial rates of intramembrane sterol trafficking in vitro. The concentration of SCP-2 used in this study (1.5 µM) falls in the range of 1–50 µM that is present in normal tissues (47Nichols J.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1889-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 48Paulussen R.J.A. Geleen M.J.H. Beyner A.C. Veerkamp J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This concentration was highly effective in stimulating sterol transfer in both similar and dissimilar donor-acceptor pairs (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and Tables I, II, III). The largest stimulatory effect of SCP-2 was seen in sterol transfer from plasma membranes to microsomes, where the rate was increased ∼27-fold, and from plasma membranes to mitochondria (∼12-fold). The lowest rate enhancement by SCP-2 was observed in homogeneous sterol exchange between microsomes (∼2-fold) and mitochondria (∼2-fold). More important, SCP-2 enhanced sterol trafficking from PM to MICRO and from PM to MITO to a much greater extent than in the reverse directions (27-fold versus 5-fold and 12-fold versus 4-fold, respectively). Thus, SCP-2 stimulates sterol transfer down a concentration gradient from cholesterol-rich PM to relatively cholesterol-poor MICRO and MITO. L-FABP under the same conditions caused a significant increase in the initial sterol transfer rate only in a few donor-acceptor pairs: PM-PM (∼1.5-fold), PM-MITO (∼3-fold), and MICRO-MITO (∼3-fold). Although it appears that L-FABP was much less effective in stimulating intermembrane sterol transfer, it must be recognized that the cytosolic L-FABP concentration in liver and intestine is up to 64-fold higher than that of SCP-2 (48Paulussen R.J.A. Geleen M.J.H. Beyner A.C. Veerkamp J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 49Paulussen RJA Veerkamp JH Subcell. Biochem. 1990; 16: 175-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, subcellular compartmentalization of SCP-2 differs markedly from that of L-FABP. SCP-2 is present not only in the cytosol, but also in peroxisomes and/or mitochondria (50Keller G.A. Scallen T.J. Clarke D. Maher P.A. Krisans S.K. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, L-FABP is primarily cytosolic, with some enrichment near the endoplasmic reticulum (49Paulussen RJA Veerkamp JH Subcell. Biochem. 1990; 16: 175-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 51Bordewick U. Heese M. Borchers T. Robenek H. Spener F. Biol. Chem.

Acta. 1989; 1002: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).It should be noted, that in comparison with L-FABP, the role of SCP-2 in sterol transfer has been investigated more extensively. To our knowledge, there are only a few examples (4Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R. Kier A.B. Knittel J. Scallen T.J. Wood W.G. Hapala I. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 196: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 21Woodford J.K. Jefferson J.R. Wood W.G. Hubbell T. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7682-7690Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) where an effect of L-FABP on intermembrane sterol transfer was tested. It appears that L-FABP enhances sterol exchange between plasma membranes (4Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R. Kier A.B. Knittel J. Scallen T.J. Wood W.G. Hapala I. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 196: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), but has no influence on sterol transfer between model lipid vesicles (29Hapala I. Kavecansky J. Butko P. Scallen T.J. Joiner C.H. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7682-7690Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was also shown that spontaneous sterol exchange between plasma membranes obtained from cells transfected with cDNA coding for L-FABP is significantly faster in comparison with nontransfected cell lines (21Woodford J.K. Jefferson J.R. Wood W.G. Hubbell T. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1145: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations serve as indirect evidence that expression of L-FABP alters the transferability of sterol between biological membranes and thereby alters the intracellular sterol distribution. Similar studies with transfected cells overexpressing SCP-2 remain to be performed.The mechanism by which cytosolic lipid carrier proteins stimulate sterol transfer between biological membranes is not fully understood. A preponderance of data indicate that SCP-2 or L-FABP binds to the membrane surface and then interacts with sterol in the membrane, thereby stimulating sterol desorption from the membrane (46Gadella T.W.J. Wirtz K.W.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 53Billheimer J.T. Gaylor J.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Under certain circumstances, differences in the surface charge between donor or acceptor model membranes can modulate the extent and direction of SCP-2-mediated sterol transfer (46Gadella T.W.J. Wirtz K.W.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The data presented in this paper do not allow assignment of a unique role to SCP-2 in each of the membrane combinations tested in vitro for intracellular protein-mediated sterol trafficking. However, the new observations made may be significant to sterol metabolism as follows.(a) Sterol movement within microsomes, a membrane fraction accounting for the majority of sterol synthesis and cholesterol esterification, was observed to be rapid. However, sterol synthesis does not occur in a single microsomal fraction, but a product of one intermediate reaction must be transferred to the next enzymatic step in another microsomal subfraction to accomplish complete cholesterol synthesis (56Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15592-15597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may be postulated that this fast intramicrosomal sterol trafficking may play an important role in sterol biosynthesis. This also suggests that the process of sterol transfer in this microsomal sterol synthetic machinery is mediated by a cytosolic protein. SCP-2 is an appropriate candidate protein that may mediate this sterol transfer.(b) SCP-2-mediated MICRO-PM and MITO-PM pathways may play an important role in reverse cholesterol transport, i.e. removing free cholesterol from nonspecialized cells, which do not produce steroid hormones or bile acids. The data show that SCP-2 enhanced MICRO-PM sterol transfer by 5-fold in vitro. Recent results with intact human fibroblasts transfected with SCP-2 antisense oligonucleotides showed a 5-fold reduction in rapid cholesterol transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to plasma membranes (58Puglielli L.

This observation is consistent with the present findings with isolated membrane fractions in vitro.(c) SCP-2-mediated MICRO-MITO and PM-MITO pathways may be involved in supplying cholesterol to mitochondria for oxidation to steroid hormones in steroidogenic cells (59Pfeiffer S.M.

SCP-2 is a potent stimulator of microsomal acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase in vitro (42Butko P. Hapala I. Scallen T.J. Schroeder F.

Intracellular esterification of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol is enhanced in transfected L-cell fibroblasts expressing SCP-2. 2E. J. Murphy and F. Schroeder, unpublished data. In contrast, published reports utilizing mutant Chinese hamster ovary (63Johnson W.J. Reinhart M.P. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hepatoma (64Van Heusden G.P.H. Souren J. Geelen M.J.H. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 846: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) cell lines provide some doubt as to whether SCP-2 functions in enhancing cholesterol esterification in vivo. Because it appears unlikely that the genetic defect in the mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells or hepatoma cells is in the SCP-2 gene, alterations in SCP-2 expression in the mutant and hepatoma cells may represent secondary effects. In addition, Puglielli et al. (58Puglielli L. Rigotti A. Greco A.V. Santos M. Nervi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have shown that both a vesicular and an SCP-2-mediated sterol transfer pathway are operative in human fibroblasts. Thus, reductions in SCP-2 expression (63Johnson W.J. Reinhart M.P. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 64Van Heusden G.P.H. Souren J. Geelen M.J.H.

Consequently, it is difficult to make clear-cut interpretations from correlations between SCP-2 expression and cholesterol esterification in the mutant cell lines. INTRODUCTIONSterols are essential components serving both structural and functional roles in mammalian cells. Sterols modulate membrane fluidity and thickness, thereby contributing to membrane passive permeability and activity of integral membrane proteins (1Yeagle P.L. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B. Advances In Cholesterol Research. Telford Press, Caldwell, NJ1990: 111Google Scholar, 2Bloch K. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 363Google Scholar). Sterols form both lateral and transbilayer sterol domains (for reviews, see 3Schroeder F. Nemecz G. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B.

Chem. 1981; 256: 2016-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, there appears to be synergism between cholesterol biosynthesis and synthesis of DNA, RNA, and phospholipids (9Cornell R.B. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Cornell R.B. Goldfein H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 504-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates such as isoprenoids are required for glycoprotein synthesis and the synthesis of ubiquinones (11Maltese W.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3319-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 12Edwards P.A. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 383Google Scholar).Cholesterol is not uniformly distributed in cells. Sterol synthetic activity in eukaryotic cells is concentrated in the relatively cholesterol-poor endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes (12Edwards P.A. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 383Google Scholar), whereas the plasma membrane accommodates the major part of intracellular sterol content (13Colbeau A. Nachbauer J.

Chem. 1976; 251: 5015-5026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Corticosteroid synthesis from cholesterol occurs in the cholesterol-deficient inner mitochondrial membrane (15Nestler J.E. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B. Advances In Cholesterol Research. Telford Press, Caldwell, NJ1990: 133Google Scholar). Consequently, extensive sterol transfer and targeting must occur between these intracellular membranes, either against or with the cholesterol gradient, respectively (4Schroeder F. Jefferson J.R.

Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite their importance to sterol homeostasis in the cell, the major pathways of intracellular sterol trafficking are still unclear.The vast majority of information on sterol transfer/exchange has focused on model membranes (4Schroeder F.

Thus, the first objective of this study was to explore spontaneous sterol trafficking between cellular components such as plasma, microsomal, and mitochondrial membranes. The second objective was to investigate the role of SCP-2 1The abbreviations used are: SCP-2sterol carrier protein-2L-FABPliver fatty acid-binding proteinDHEdehydroergosterol (Δ5,7,9,(11),22-ergostatetraen-3β-ol)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)PMplasma membrane(s)MICROmicrosomal membrane(s)MITOmitochondrial membrane(s). and L-FABP, cytosolic lipid transfer proteins, in targeting potential pathways of intracellular sterol trafficking.

Infection of cells with AdexCATβTR induced expression of the truncated receptor, the amount of which would be excessive compared with those of both full-length type I and type II receptors, as assessed by levels of their mRNAs. The antiproliferative effect of TGF-β was completely eliminated in both endothelial cells and Mv1Lu that were infected with AdexCATβTR. The transcriptional activation by TGF-β of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and fibronectin was entirely suppressed. Abrogation of the TGF-β-enhanced production of type I collagen in infected smooth muscle cells was confirmed by immunocytostaining and by [14C]proline incorporation in a quantitative manner. Mitogenic response to other growth factors remained unaffected in infected cells.

These results have prompted Cohen to propose that polyadenylation facilitates the exonucleolytic degradation of RNAs, particularly by PNPase, and that cleavage of RNAs mediated by RNase E is functionally coordinated with the 3′-exonucleolytic activity of PNPase (15Cohen S.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 829-832Google Scholar). The latter seems plausible in view of the association between these enzymes (16Carpousis A.J. van Houwe G. Ehretsmann C. Krisch H.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 889-900Google Scholar, 17Py B. Causton H. Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 717-729Google Scholar).The mRNA for ribosomal protein S20 is a well characterized substrate for RNase E both in vivo and in vitro (18Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4112-4120Google Scholar, 19Rapaport L.R. Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 992-998Google Scholar, 20Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2488-2497Google Scholar). Both crude and purified RNase E cleave a synthetic S20 transcript (372 residues) to generate a number of products, the most prominent of which spans 147 residues coterminal with the substrate's 3′-end and is identical to a degradative intermediate found in vivo (18Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4112-4120Google Scholar, 20Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2488-2497Google Scholar). Further degradation of the 3′-terminal 147-residue product of RNase E-mediated cleavage in vivo requires PNPase activity, since this product is stabilized and accumulates in pnp mutants (18Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4112-4120Google Scholar). The 147-residue product is, however, essentially stable in vitro, even in relatively crude extracts (8Mackie G.A. Genereaux J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 998-1012Google Scholar, 20Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2488-2497Google Scholar). The S20 mRNA has served as a model to search for conditions that would permit its total degradation in vitro and to test some of the predictions of Cohen's model (15Cohen S.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 829-832Google Scholar). We show here that RNase II can participate in the degradation in vitro of the 5′ two-thirds of the S20 mRNA and that oligoadenylation can significantly stimulate the activity of RNase II. Furthermore, oligoadenylation is a prerequisite for the complete degradation of the S20 mRNA, a process also dependent on PNPase, but both steps can be completely uncoupled from endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase E. INTRODUCTIONCurrent models for the turnover of mRNAs in Escherichia coli postulate that degradation is initiated by an endonucleolytic cleavage usually catalyzed by RNase E (1Mudd E.A. Krisch H.M. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2127-2135Google Scholar, 2Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1-5Google Scholar, 3Melefors Ö von Gabain A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 857-864Google Scholar). Subsequent steps involve the attack on newly created 3′-ends by one or both of two exonucleases, RNase II or polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) 1The abbreviation used is: PNPasepolynucleotide phosphorylase.

This raises the question of how RNAs containing regions of extensive secondary structure can be degraded, since stem-loop structures can occlude potential RNase E sites (8Mackie G.A. Genereaux J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 998-1012Google Scholar) and block the processive action of 3′-exonucleases (6Mclaren R.S. Newbury S.F. Dance G.S.C. Causton H.C. Higgins C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 81-95Google Scholar). Recent work has implicated the products of the pcnB and pnp genes encoding poly(A) polymerase (9Cao G.J. Sarkar N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10380-10384Google Scholar, 10Masters M. Collums M.D. Oliver I.R. He L. MacNaughton E.J. Charters Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4405-4413Google Scholar) and PNPase, respectively, in the degradation of RNA I, a highly structured, small (108 nucleotides), untranslated, antisense inhibitor of the replication of colE1 replicons (11Xu F.

Polyadenylation also destabilizes the mRNA encoding ribosomal protein S15 (13Hajnsdorf E. Braun F. Haugel-Nielson J. Regnier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3973-3977Google Scholar) and appears to regulate the decay of mRNAs generally (14O'Hara E.B. Chekanova J.A. Ingle C.A. Kushner Z.R. Peters E. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, we characterized a novel isoform of 11β-HSD in aldosterone target cells, which has high affinity for its substrate, is unidirectional, and prefers NAD as cofactor. In this study we utilized a green fluorescent protein (GFP) technique to determine the subcellular localization of this isoform, 11β-HSD2. We generated a chimeric gene encoding the full-length rabbit 11β-HSD2 and, fused to its C terminus, the coding sequence of GFP. This construct was stably transfected into CHO cells. The enzymatic characteristics of the expressed 11β-HSD2/GFP fusion protein were undistinguishable from those of the native enzyme: high affinity for corticosterone (KM 8–10 nM), NAD dependence, and lack of reductase activity. The intracellular location of the recombinant protein was determined by fluorescence microscopy. 11β-HSD2-associated fluorescence was observed as a reticular network over the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope, whereas the plasma membrane and the nucleus were negative, suggesting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization. Staining of CHO cells expressing 11β-HSD2/GFP with established subcellular organelle markers revealed a colocalization of 11β-HSD2/GFP only with ER markers and tubulin. To examine the orientation of 11β-HSD2 within the ER, we selectively permeabilized CHO cells and stained them with an anti-GFP antibody. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that the C-terminal region of 11β-HSD2 is on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER membrane, since it was accessible to the GFP antibody. This conclusion was confirmed by trypsin treatment of permeabilized cells followed by Western blotting. The C-terminal region of 11β-HSD2 was accessible to trypsin, indicating that it is on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane.These results indicate that 11β-HSD2 is localized exclusively to the ER. Since 11β-HSD2 does not contain any known ER retrieval signal, experiments are currently under way to determine what structural motifs are responsible for its ER localization. 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) is thought to confer aldosterone specificity to mineralocorticoid target cells by protecting the inherently non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) from occupancy by endogenous glucocorticoids.

INTRODUCTIONSecretory IgA (sIgA), 1The abbreviations used are: sIgAsecretory IgAIgAimmunoglobulin ASCsecretory componentrSCrecombinant human SCLPSlipopolysaccharideSPRsurface plasmon resonanceELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyHRPhorseradish peroxidaseIgGimmunoglobulin G. the principal immunoglobulin in mucous membrane secretions, consists of two monomeric IgA units and two additional polypeptide chains, J chain and secretory component (SC). The four constituent polypeptides are produced by two distinct types of cells. The heavy, the light, and the J chains are synthesized and assembled by plasma cells. SC corresponds to the five extracellular domains of the poly-Ig receptor and is contributed by the epithelial cells of mucous membranes and exocrine glands. During passage through the epithelium, dimeric IgA with attached J chain becomes associated with SC to form fully assembled sIgA. Despite the discovery of sIgAs in the early sixties, their mechanism of action remains poorly understood, mainly because of the difficulty in producing sufficient amounts of purified dimeric IgA or sIgA antibodies in a nonaggregated, native conformation.IgA produced in large quantities from hybridoma cell lines can potentially be used for passive protection or therapeutic intervention on mucosal surfaces. For instance, monoclonal IgA antibodies directed against respiratory syncytial virus applied passively to the nasopharyngeal mucosa subsequently prevented initial infection and pneumonia (Weltzin et al., 46Weltzin R. Hsu S.A. Mittler E.S. Georgakopoulos K.M. Monath T.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2785-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Passive oral delivery of IgA antibodies protected also against bacterial infections in the intestine of mice (Winner et al., 47Winner III, L. Mack J. Weltzin R. Mekalanos J.J. Kraehenbuhl J.-P.

Immun. 1995; 63: 1394-1399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, relatively high doses of antibodies have to be applied to ensure protection, because of 1) the heterogeneity of IgA hybridoma products (as for instance monomers, single heavy, and light chains), and 2) the lower proteolytic stability of IgAs without bound SC (Mestecky et al., 26Mestecky M. Lue C. Russell M.W. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1991; 20: 441-471PubMed Google Scholar). Such a passive treatment would therefore gain in efficiency if a purification procedure of biologically active IgA dimers with SC binding capacity would be available.IgA and sIgA have been purified on a laboratory scale from a variety of sources including milk (Brandtzaeg, 6Brandtzaeg P.

However, these methods suffer from the difficulty of obtaining highly purified and properly separated mono-, di-, and polymeric forms in sufficient quantities to allow for direct comparison of the biological properties of these antibody molecules. The present article describes methods for the purification of different molecular forms of IgA in milligram quantities from an anti-Vibrio cholerae mouse hybridoma cell line. The ability of the different molecular forms to bind with antigen and with recombinant SC have been studied extensively. We demonstrate using surface plasmon resonance that SC does not modify the affinity of IgA for the antigen. The readily scalable procedure described enables the preparation of biologically active IgA and sIgA molecular forms which eventually will contribute to a fuller biochemical understanding of how the function of this important class of antibodies is mediated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Line and Antibody ProductionThe murine hybridoma cell line ZAC3 is a fusion of a lymphocyte from Peyer's patches of a BALB/c mouse orally immunized with V. cholerae Inaba strain with the myeloma cell line Sp/2.0. ZAC3 secretes IgA antibodies corresponding to the human allotype A2 m(1) (Mestecky and Kilian, 25Mestecky M. Kilian M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 37-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) directed against surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The cultures were grown in a protein-free Turbodoma FMX standard medium (F. Messi Cell Culture Technologies, Switzerland) in a 2-liter continuous stirred tank reactor (Biolafitte, France) with a working volume of 1.6 liters. The pH was maintained at pH 7.3, the dissolved oxygen concentration was automatically controlled at 80% air saturation, and the temperature was maintained at 36.5°C. During production, the reactor was operated with a medium feed rate of 1.2 liters/day. For cell separation the harvest was filtered through a Sartoclean CA membrane capsule with pore sizes of 0.65 and 0.8 µm (Sartorius, Germany). The cell-free culture harvest containing the IgA antibodies was stored under sterile conditions at 4°C until further required.IgA Concentration10-liter harvests were concentrated with a cross-flow membrane ultrafiltration system (Skan AG, Switzerland) equipped with a type Omega low protein binding membrane (100-kDa molecular mass cut-off) of surface area 2.46 m2. Filtration was performed such that one-third of the liquid passed the membrane and two-thirds remained in the system. The solutions were 10-fold concentrated and diluted again to the starting volume with loading buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.3) for subsequent diafiltration. The final retentates of 10-liter culture harvests were stored at 4°C until further required. Protein concentration of small volumes (50–300 ml) was carried out using a 50-ml Amicon stirred cell equipped with an Omega type membrane (10 kDa cut-off value) at a pressure of 1 bar. Concentration reduced the starting volume to 5 ml.Column ChromatographyColumn chromatography was performed with a HiLoad™ system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) comprising an UV-M II monitor, P-50 pump, a gradient programmer GP-10, a SuperFrac fraction collector, and a recorder model 102. All steps were performed at 4°C unless otherwise indicated. The final retentate of a 10-liter cell culture harvest was loaded onto a 500-ml DEAE-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) column (5 cm × 25 cm) equilibrated in loading buffer. Following washes with 2 column volumes, stepwise elution was performed with 2 column volumes each of 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.3) containing successively 200 mM, 300 mM, and 500 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 30 cm/h. The profile of total protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and the IgA-containing fractions were identified by ELISA. These latter were pooled, diluted twice with 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.3) and passed over a 50-ml DEAE-Sepharose FF column (2.6 cm × 10 cm), washed, and eluted as above. The concentrated IgA was then separated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia) column (2.6 cm × 200 cm) equilibrated and run in PBS (Sambrook et al., 30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 0.02% sodium azide. Chromatography was carried out at room temperature with a flow rate of 6.1 cm/h (0.5 ml/min). Elution of total protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions containing the same molecular form of IgA were pooled and diluted twice with ultrapure water prior to final concentration by DEAE-Sepharose FF chromatography in a 5-ml column (1.6 cm × 5 cm) equilibrated in loading buffer. Elution was carried out using a linear salt gradient ranging from 200 mM to 500 mM NaCl over 10 column volumes. The IgA concentration of each molecular form was determined by ELISA, and the purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The IgA solutions were stored at 4°C. As an alternative approach, 20 ml of protein concentrate was passed over an AcA 22 Ultrogel (Biosepra, France) size-exclusion column (2.8 cm × 180 cm) equilibrated in 50 mM borate (pH 8.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 at a flow rate of 2 cm/h (0.3 ml/min).Anti-mouse IgA α Chain-specific ELISATotal IgA concentration was determined by sandwich ELISA. Goat anti-mouse IgA α chain-specific antiserum (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in 50 mM bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) was used to coat wells (50 µl/well) of Immulon (Dynatech) 96-well plates overnight at 4°C, which were subsequently blocked (250 µl/well) with 1% BSA (Fluka) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) at 37°C for 30 min. Between all antibody incubation steps except the last one, the plates were washed three times with PBS, 0.01% Tween 20. IgA samples and mouse IgA standards (Sigma; range 0.4 ng-7.5 ng) were diluted in blocking buffer, and 50 µl were applied, in duplicate, to the wells. After incubation for 2 h at 37°C, IgA was detected with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgA antibodies (Amersham) followed by coupling with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Amersham) and development with ortho-phenyldiamine/H2O2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.01% sodium azide in citrate buffer (pH 5.0). The absorbance was read at 492 nm and 629 nm, with the latter serving as reference reading.LPS-specific ELISAThe antibody binding specificity was detected by sandwich ELISA as above exept that LPS (lipopolysaccharide from V. cholerae, serotype Inaba 569B, Sigma) was used as the capture reagent. For each assay, three ELISA plates were needed. Plate 1 was used to measure the concentration of total IgA in the purified monomer, dimer, and polymer samples. Plate 2 served to test the specificity of association of the different molecular forms of IgA to the LPS antigen. Plate 3 allowed the percentage of LPS binding activity of IgA antibody molecules to be determined indirectly.Plates 1 and 3 were coated with 50 µl of goat anti-mouse IgA (α chain) antiserum diluted 1:500 in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6), while plate 2 was coated with 50 µl of 40 µg/ml LPS in the same buffer. Plates 1 and 2 were incubated for 3 h at 37°C and blocked as above, while plate 3 was incubated overnight at 4°C. Tetra-applicates of IgA samples and duplicates of mouse IgA standards (50 µl) in blocking buffer were applied into the wells of plates 1 and 2 and incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, plate 1 was developed according to the protocol given above for α chain-specific ELISA, yielding values of total IgA. Plate 3 was blocked for 30 min at 37°C, prior to transfer of 45 µl of each IgA sample of plate 2 and 45 µl of freshly diluted IgA standards, incubated for 2 h at 37°C, then developed as above to yield the concentration of LPS-unbound IgA. The LPS binding activity of the different IgA forms was finally calculated by subtracting the concentration values of plate 3 from the corresponding values of plate 1.Photometric Determination of Protein ConcentrationTotal protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford-based protein assay (Bio-Rad). For the estimation of protein concentration, an extinction coefficient of 1.3 was used (Stoscheck, 33Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar; Vaerman, 42Vaerman J.-P. Immunol. Invest. 1995; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), so that 1 unit A280 = 1/1.3 mg.In Vitro Reassociation of IgA and SCMonomeric, dimeric, and multimeric IgA from mouse hybridoma ZAC3 obtained by the purification procedure given above were combined with purified recombinant human SC (rSC; Rindisbacher et al. (29Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) in PBS and incubated for 16 h at ambient temperature. Molar ratios and the amount of protein used are indicated in the figure legends. Formation of covalent complexes was assayed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For antigen binding experiments (ELISA, SPR), reassociated secretory IgA was prepared in the presence of a molar excess of recombinant rSC, followed by size-exclusion chromatography to separate sIgA from the excess of rSC. For protein amounts below 100 µg, the samples were passed over a 1 cm × 30 cm Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) at 0.2 ml/min. For the preparation of 0.5 mg of protein and above, the samples were chromatographed on a Superdex 200 (Pharmacia) column (1.6 cm × 140 cm) run at 0.6 ml/min. Equilibration and elution were carried out in PBS. To ensure a constant flow rate, both columns were coupled to a FPLC system (Pharmacia), with continuous monitoring at 278 nm. The identity of the polypeptides in the column fractions was checked by immunoblotting with antisera against rSC and against IgA α chain. The resulting complex stoichiometry was assessed by ELISA.Electrophoretic MethodsProtein SDS-PAGEGel electrophoresis of proteins was carried out in a mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad), according to the method of 20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar. PAGE was performed under nonreduced denaturing conditions (1% SDS) or reduced (in the presence of 2%β-mercaptoethanol or 100 mM dithiothreitol) and native mode, depending on the nature of the samples under analysis. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R or immunoblotted.LPS Urea/SDS-PAGEGel electrophoresis of LPS was performed as described by 37Tsai C.-M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, using Salmonella wild-type LPS and Salmonella Re 595 LPS as standards (Sigma). Polyacrylamide gel concentration was either 14% or 8–15% gradient. Running and stacking gel buffers contained both 4 M urea and 0.1% SDS. Following separation, gels were stained with silver or immunoblotted with purified IgAm, IgAd, or IgAp.ImmunoblottingIgA Heavy and Light ChainNonspecific binding sites on nitrocellulose or polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) were saturated for 1 h at room temperature by incubation in a blocking buffer made of PBS, 10% BSA (Fluka), and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma). The membrane was probed for 2 h at room temperature with either biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgA heavy chain antibody (Amersham) or with biotinylated goat anti-mouse κ chain specific antibody (Amersham), diluted 1:1,000 in PBS/0.05% Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected using streptavidin coupled to HRP and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham.IgA J ChainNonspecific binding sites were saturated for 1 h at room temperature by incubation in a blocking buffer made of 25 mM Tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.5, 5% non-fat dry milk, and 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was probed for 2 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-human J chain serum (Hendrickson et al., 12Hendrickson B.A. Conner D.A. Ladd D.J. Kendall D. Casanova J.E. Corthésy B. Max E.E. Neutra M.R. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer for 2 h. Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies (Sigma) and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham.Human SCDetection of the SC-IgA complexes was performed using the procedure given in Rindisbacher et al. (29Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).LPSPolyvinylidine difluoride membranes were blocked with PBS, 10% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 prior to incubation with 1 µg of IgAd, IgAp, and sIgA for 1 h. The interaction between LPS on the membrane and various IgA forms was detected using goat anti-mouse IgA heavy chain antibody, and rabbit anti-goat HRP-conjugated IgG.Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) MeasurementsMeasurements were performed on a home-built setup using a Kretschmann configuration (Kretschmann, 19Kretschmann E. Opt. Commun. 1972; 6: 185-187Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar), as schematically shown in Fig. 1. Adsorption of molecules to, or desorption from, the surface shifts the angle of surface plasmon resonance (Knoll, 17Knoll W. Mat. Res. Soc. Bull. 1991; 16: 29-39Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For organic layers in which the thickness d is much smaller than the light wavelength, the angle shift is proportional to the change in optical thickness of the layer (which is the product Δn ×Δd, where the refractive index difference is Δn = nlayer− nbuffer and Δd the change in geometrical thickness). For molecular layers with an index of refraction n = 1.45, the experimental angle resolution of 0.01° allowed the detection of thickness changes of 1 Å, with a time resolution of 1 measurement every 10 s.Preparation of LPS Membranes on Gold Surfaces and IgA BindingA supported monolayer of LPS was formed on an alkylated gold surface by exposing the support to a LPS vesicles dispersion, a procedure analogous to vesicle spreading techniques used for formation of phospholipid monolayers on alkylated surfaces (Kalb et al., 15Kalb E. Frey S. Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1103: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar; Terrettaz et al., 35Terrettaz S. Stora T. Duschl C. Vogel H. Langmuir. 1993; 9: 1361-1369Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Glass slides with evaporated 50 nm gold film were immersed overnight in a 1 mg/ml solution of tetradecanethiol in ethanol to cover the gold with a self-assembled, tightly packed thioalkane layer (Bain et al., 2Bain C.D. Troughton E.B. Tao Y.-T. Evall J. Whitesides G.M. Nuzzo R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 321-335Crossref Scopus (3652) Google Scholar). LPS vesicle dispersions were produced by four times sonication of 1 mg of LPS in 50 µl of 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a bath-type sonicator (Sonorex PK, Modell 102p) for 3 min. The clear vesicle dispersion obtained was diluted to a final LPS concentration of 1 mg/ml. 400 µl of this dispersion were placed into the cuvette, and LPS adsorption to the surface was monitored with SPR. When a stable signal had been attained (usually after 1 to 1.5 h), indicating that LPS layer formation was complete, excess LPS was removed by diluting 1:1 (v:v) with 25 mM phosphate buffer 10 times, while continuously maintaining the LPS layer covered with buffer. The SPR angle obtained after this rinsing procedure was used as a packing measure of the LPS layer.To measure IgAd binding to these supported LPS monolayers, first the phosphate buffer was exchanged by PBS by diluting 10 times 1:1 with PBS, then 200 µl of PBS were removed, leaving 200 µl in the cuvette to cover the LPS monolayer. At the beginning of the IgAd concentration series, the baseline was recorded. Then, 200 µl of IgAd solution of two times the desired concentration was injected, mixed with the solution in the cuvette, and the binding was recorded. At low IgAd concentrations, intermediate injections were performed to account for adsorption of IgAd to the cuvette walls, by replacing 200 µl of the solution in the cuvette with 200 µl of the simple IgAd concentration. When binding at the given concentration was complete, a rinsing step was done by diluting 1:3 (v:v) with PBS 2 to 5 times, depending on the previous IgAd concentration in the cuvette. From the SPR angle after the rinse step, the base line was subtracted to give the angle shift corresponding to the amount of bound IgAd at the respective concentration. The binding at the next higher IgAd concentration was then measured.MicrocalorimetryCalorimetric measurements (Wiseman et al., 48Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar) were carried out using an MCS isothermal titration microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Due to the amphiphilic nature of LPS, measurements were performed in 50 mM octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (Fluka) dissolved in PBS. The 1.36-ml cell was filled with a 1 mg/ml IgA solution in octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside/PBS, corresponding to an antibody concentration of 2.9 µM. A solution of 1.5 mg/ml LPS in octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside/PBS was stepwise injected from a 250-µl syringe at 5-min intervals in portions of 12 µl (except the first shot, which was 1 µl), while stirring at 400 rpm. At this LPS concentration, an average of one LPS molecule is present per three detergent micelles; thus, no cross-linking by antibodies occurs. Water was used as reference and the instrument was calibrated by standard electrical pulses. Data analysis was performed using the Origin software and routines delivered by MicroCal together with the instrument. As LPS represents a mixture of species with different sugar chain lengths, an average molar mass had to be assumed. In a first step, this was set to 5,000 and the heat per injection was fitted with a single-site binding model with, as free parameters, number of ligands (N) per antibody, affinity constant K, and molar heat of binding H. From the obtained value of N, the average LPS molar mass was readjusted to give a binding stoichiometry of n = 4 (new molar mass: 10,400), and the fit was repeated to give new values K and H.DISCUSSIONAmong the human immunoglobulins, IgA is one of the most difficult to purify. Indeed, IgA heterogeneity with respect to molecular weight is known for IgA deriving from myeloma cells and for sIgA from colostrum. Procedures developed for monomeric IgA deriving from natural sources such as human serum (Heremans, 13Heremans J.F. Sela M. The Antigens. Academic Press Inc., New York1974: 365Crossref Google Scholar; Mestecky and Kilian, 25Mestecky M. Kilian M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 37-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) are complicated processes most frequently yielding only small quantities of purified IgA. Higher molecular IgA forms are found in human myeloma cultures and in external secretions. Colostrum and early milk represent the most convenient source of human sIgA. No simple purification procedure for IgA produced by hybridoma cell culture techniques, which allows the purification and separation of different molecular forms of IgA in large quantities, has been reported so far. We have developed a simple purification scheme, based on classical chromatographic methods leading to pure and biologically active IgAd and IgAp.Since IgA was produced in protein-free culture medium, the problems associated with purification due to the presence of serum IgA were abolished. As an alternative to ammonium sulfate precipitation (Mestecky and Kilian, 25Mestecky M. Kilian M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 37-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which presents the disadvantage of exposing the samples to salts that interfere in ELISA and protein determination,2 ultrafiltration was found to be a valuable method, allowing to concentrate IgA 10-fold with a yield of 80%. We indeed observed that a 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off did not only reduce the loading volume for the following chromatography step, but also the amount of protein (contaminants and IgAm) in the IgA-containing fraction by about 60%. Further enrichment in IgA by a factor of 3.4 was achieved using ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose FF resin. 80 to 90% of the IgA loaded could be eluted stepwise as a single fraction with 200 mM salt. This choice of a DEAE-type resin has been applied to the purification of human IgA (Mestecky and Kilian, 25Mestecky M. Kilian M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 37-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and mouse IgA (Lee et al., 21Lee C.K. Weltzin R. Soman G. Georgakopoulos K.M. Houle D.M. Monath T.P. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 887-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may suggest a general use for DEAE-based ion-exchange chromatography in IgA purification or concentration. Subsequently, IgA mono-, di-, and polymers were separated in a single chromatography step. This separation required a 200-cm-long Sephacryl S-300 column (maximum load 25–30 mg of protein) and a long run (6.1 cm/h), but avoided the repetitive runs using AcA 22 Ultrogel columns reported by 42Vaerman J.-P. Immunol. Invest. 1995; 24: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar for IgA from human myeloma cells.The biochemical characterization of the different forms of IgA showed that polymeric and dimeric forms contained all three α, κ, and J chain polypeptides (Fig. 4, A-E). Two different forms of mouse IgA exist (Vaerman, 41Vaerman J.-P. Res. Immunochem. Immunobiol. 1972; 3: 1-95Google Scholar): one in which light chains are disulfide-linked to each other (IgAL-L) and the second where light chains are linked to heavy chains (IgAH-L). In ZAC3 hybridoma, partial covalent association of the light chain to heavy chain could be detected in monomers and dimers but not in polymers (Fig. 4B). Under nonreducing conditions, the presence of J chain could be detected in dimeric and polymeric IgA forms only (Fig. 4E). However, under reducing conditions, the monomer fraction also showed a weak J chain signal (Fig. 4D), most likely due to traces of IgAd (Fig. 3C), as reported by 45Weicker J. Underdown B.J. J. Immunol. 1975; 114: 1337-1344PubMed Google Scholar. Indeed, IgAm usually does not contain J chain (Koshland, 18Koshland M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1985; 3: 425-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar; Kerr, 16Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).Binding experiments of the different purified IgA forms to an outer membrane LPS antigen from V. cholerae revealed that IgA monomers did not associate with LPS whereas dimers and polymers did. As published by Ishizaka et al. (14Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. Lee E.H. Fudenberg H. J. Immunol. 1965; 95: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar), the polymeric nature of secretory IgA provides an increase in overall avidity for antigen and also an enhanced ability to cross-link multiple particles.

Lis H. Science. 1989; 246: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). The lectin reversibly binds saccharides only when the calcium-binding site S2 is occupied (Kalb and Levitzki, 19Kalb A.J. Levitzki A. Biochem. J. 1968; 109: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Binding of calcium itself is conditional on the binding of one of several divalent metal ions (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, or Zn2+) (Shoham et al., 37Shoham M. Kalb A.J. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or, at neutral pH, also Ca2+ (Koenig et al., 22Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) at the transition metal binding site S1. The metal ions in S1 and S2 are only 4.2 Å apart and are bridged by two aspartate carboxyl groups (Asp10 and Asp19) (Hardman et al., 15Hardman K.D. Agarwal R.C. Freiser M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Two ligand side chains of calcium are involved in monosaccharide binding, either directly (Asn14) or via a water molecule (Asp208) (Derewenda et al., 1989). The binding of the metal ions causes large structural changes that pull the ligand residues of the saccharide-binding site into place and induce the carbohydrate binding capacity of the lectin. Nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion studies have allowed the successive binding to metal-free ConA of the metal ions in S1 and S2 to be followed (Brown et al., 8Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3883-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The binding of the metal ions induces a slow (from minutes to days) conformational transition in the protein, referred to as “locking” because it involves an increase in the affinity of both metals for the protein (Koenig et al., 22Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The high activation energy for this process is probably largely due to the isomerization of a non-proline peptide bond, Ala207-Asp208, located in a β-strand neighboring the S2 site. This bond has the trans-conformation in metal-free ConA (Bouckaert et al., 4Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Prot. Struct. Funct. Gen. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but adopts the unusual cis-conformation in the native protein.A most interesting result of the NMRD studies was the demonstration that a significant portion of metal-free ConA, 12.5% at 25°C and pH 6.4, is locked (Brown et al., 9Brown III, R.D. Brewer C.F. Koenig S.H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Locked metal-free ConA can bind methyl-α-D-mannopyranoside with 7% of the affinity of the fully metallized locked conformation, which is at least a factor 103 higher than its binding to the metal-free unlocked protein. Even more striking is that the unlocked/locked equilibrium can be shifted from being predominantly in the unlocked conformation to more than one-half (60%) locked, by preequilibration with excess saccharide for 5 days at 25°C. The specificity of saccharide binding is preserved in the metal-free locked conformation (i.e. galactose does not bind). Brown and co-workers (Brown et al., 8Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3883-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar; Brownet al., 1982) concluded that it is predominantly the locked conformation of ConA that is responsible for the saccharide binding of the lectin. The contribution of the metal ions is to maintain the locked conformation. The binding of Mn2+ in S1 and Ca2+ in S2 shifts the unlocked/locked equilibrium completely toward the locked form.In our work, we analyzed two structural intermediates in the pathway of the unlocked to the locked conformation, through the binding of a metal ion only in S1. A first approach was the soaking of crystals of metal-free ConA (Bouckaert et al., 4Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Prot. Struct. Funct. Gen. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with zinc or cobalt (apoZn-ConA and apoCo-ConA). Zn2+ and Co2+ can bind in S1 but not in S2 (Shoham et al., 37Shoham M. Kalb A.J. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in contrast to Mn2+, Cd2+, and Ca2+ that can occupy both sites (Shoham et al., 37Shoham M. Kalb A.J. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; Harrington and Wilkins, 16Harrington P.C. Wilkins R.G.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding of a metal ion in the proto-S1 site does not induce significant structural changes. Because intermolecular crystal packing interactions may hinder the sequence of changes upon metal ion binding in S1, a second approach was the co-crystallization of metal-free ConA with zinc to obtain Zn-ConA. ConA ZnCa, the structure resulting from the co-crystallization of metal-free ConA with both Zn2+ and Ca2+, has Zn2+ bound in S1 and Ca2+ in S2 and bears the structural features of the native, locked ConA.

Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or, at neutral pH, also Ca2+ (Koenig et al., 22Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) at the transition metal binding site S1. The metal ions in S1 and S2 are only 4.2 Å apart and are bridged by two aspartate carboxyl groups (Asp10 and Asp19) (Hardman et al., 15Hardman K.D. Agarwal R.C. Freiser M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Two ligand side chains of calcium are involved in monosaccharide binding, either directly (Asn14) or via a water molecule (Asp208) (Derewenda et al., 1989). The binding of the metal ions causes large structural changes that pull the ligand residues of the saccharide-binding site into place and induce the carbohydrate binding capacity of the lectin. Nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion studies have allowed the successive binding to metal-free ConA of the metal ions in S1 and S2 to be followed (Brown et al., 8Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3883-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The binding of the metal ions induces a slow (from minutes to days) conformational transition in the protein, referred to as “locking” because it involves an increase in the affinity of both metals for the protein (Koenig et al., 22Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Brown III, R.D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The high activation energy for this process is probably largely due to the isomerization of a non-proline peptide bond, Ala207-Asp208, located in a β-strand neighboring the S2 site. This bond has the trans-conformation in metal-free ConA (Bouckaert et al., 4Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Prot. Struct. Funct. Gen. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but adopts the unusual cis-conformation in the native protein.A most interesting result of the NMRD studies was the demonstration that a significant portion of metal-free ConA, 12.5% at 25°C and pH 6.4, is locked (Brown et al., 9Brown III, R.D. Brewer C.F. Koenig S.H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Locked metal-free ConA can bind methyl-α-D-mannopyranoside with 7% of the affinity of the fully metallized locked conformation, which is at least a factor 103 higher than its binding to the metal-free unlocked protein. Even more striking is that the unlocked/locked equilibrium can be shifted from being predominantly in the unlocked conformation to more than one-half (60%) locked, by preequilibration with excess saccharide for 5 days at 25°C. The specificity of saccharide binding is preserved in the metal-free locked conformation (i.e. galactose does not bind). Brown and co-workers (Brown et al., 8Brown III, R.D. Koenig S.H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3883-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar; Brownet al., 1982) concluded that it is predominantly the locked conformation of ConA that is responsible for the saccharide binding of the lectin. The contribution of the metal ions is to maintain the locked conformation. The binding of Mn2+ in S1 and Ca2+ in S2 shifts the unlocked/locked equilibrium completely toward the locked form.In our work, we analyzed two structural intermediates in the pathway of the unlocked to the locked conformation, through the binding of a metal ion only in S1. A first approach was the soaking of crystals of metal-free ConA (Bouckaert et al., 4Bouckaert J. Loris R. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Prot. Struct. Funct. Gen. 1995; 23: 510-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with zinc or cobalt (apoZn-ConA and apoCo-ConA). Zn2+ and Co2+ can bind in S1 but not in S2 (Shoham et al., 37Shoham M. Kalb A.J. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in contrast to Mn2+, Cd2+, and Ca2+ that can occupy both sites (Shoham et al., 37Shoham M. Kalb A.J. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; Harrington and Wilkins, 16Harrington P.C. Wilkins R.G.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4251-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding of a metal ion in the proto-S1 site does not induce significant structural changes. Because intermolecular crystal packing interactions may hinder the sequence of changes upon metal ion binding in S1, a second approach was the co-crystallization of metal-free ConA with zinc to obtain Zn-ConA. ConA ZnCa, the structure resulting from the co-crystallization of metal-free ConA with both Zn2+ and Ca2+, has Zn2+ bound in S1 and Ca2+ in S2 and bears the structural features of the native, locked ConA.

The lectin reversibly binds saccharides only when the calcium-binding site S2 is occupied (Kalb and Levitzki, 19Kalb A.J. Levitzki A. Biochem.

All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is a potent and specific inducer of CD38 in myeloid cells. In this report, we demonstrate that RA-induced CD38 protein from human myeloid (HL-60) leukemia cells coimmunoprecipitates with another protein of molecular mass ≈190 kDa (p190). The p190 protein is localized exclusively in the membranes and is a consequence of post-translational cross-linking of CD38 protein. This conclusion was based on the observations that purified CD38 effectively competes with p190, its accumulation is preceded by the accumulation of CD38, it immunoreacted with three different monospecific anti-CD38 antibodies on immunoblots, and its peptide map revealed several peptides in common with CD38. Furthermore, CD38 could serve as a suitable substrate for transglutaminase (TGase)-catalyzed cross-linking reactions in vitro, and the accumulation of p190 in RA-treated HL-60 cells is effectively blocked by the presence of TGase-specific inhibitor. The purified p190 showed at least three times more cyclase activity than CD38. Conversely, p190 was at least 2.5-fold less active than CD38 in hydrolyzing cADPR to ADPR. These results suggest that post-translational modification of CD38 may represent an important mechanism for regulating the two catalytic activities of this bifunctional enzyme.

The ability of CD38 protein to function as a bifunctional enzyme is likely to contribute to some of its cell-regulatory functions. Ligation of CD38 with agonistic monoclonal antibodies (moAb) has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes, suggesting that CD38 may be involved in transduction of signals that lead to activation and proliferation of these cells (2Malavasi M. Funaro A. Roggero S. Horenstein A. Calosso L. Mehta K. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Perturbation in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations is known to affect the signals involved in cell growth and proliferation. The observation that CD38 can effectively catalyze the conversion of NAD+ into cADPR, which functions independently from inositol triphosphate, suggests that CD38 may participate in signal transduction for cell growth and proliferation. However, an extracellular enzymatic role for CD38 poses an interesting topological dilemma. How does the extracellularly produced cADPR help mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular pools? One possibility is that CD38 is internalized following its interaction with an as yet unknown ligand. An alternative is that CD38 undergoes post-translational changes in response to some external stimuli and then acts intracellularly. Indeed, ligation of receptors on interaction with specific ligands is a well-known mechanism for subsequent internalization. In this paper we demonstrate that all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-induced CD38 protein in HL-60 cells undergoes post-translational modification into a high molecular weight form (p190) and that this post-translational modification of CD38 results in altered cyclase to hydrolase activities. HL-60, a human myeloblast leukemia cell line, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells (2 × 107) were cultured overnight in the presence or absence of 0.1 µM RA (supplied by Aronex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., The Woodlands, TX). Prior to metabolic labeling, the cells were incubated in cysteine-free medium for 30 min and pulsed with [35S]cysteine (50–100 µCi/ml, specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) for 2 h in the same medium with RA or in fresh medium without RA. The metabolically labeled cells (1–2 × 107) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mM unlabeled cysteine and lysed in lysis buffer (PBS containing 3% CHAPS and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) at 4°C for 20 min. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min), and the cleared lysates were preabsorbed with an irrelevant moAb, followed by the addition of 20 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Bio-Rad). The cell lysates were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with 5–15 µg of anti-CD38 antibody (IB4 or IB6 moAbs) and then for 15 min with a goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG). The immune complexes thus formed were recovered by incubating the mixture with protein A-Sepharose at 4°C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice, extracted by boiling for 4 min in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gel according to the method of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed in isopropyl alcohol:acetic acid:water (25:10:65) and soaked in AMPLIFY (Amersham Corp.) prior to drying. The dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Sigma) for fluorography. To test the ability of purified CD38 to compete with the radiolabeled immunoprecipitable bands, CD38 was purified from red blood cells according to a procedure described elsewhere (18Zocchi E. Franco L. Guida L. Benatti U. Bargellesi A. Malavasi F. Lee H.C. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Purified CD38 protein (10 µg) was included in the labeled cell lysate during immunoprecipitation with anti-CD38 antibody. To study the kinetics of p190 accumulation, HL-60 cells (2 × 107) were incubated in the presence or absence of RA for 2, 4, 6, 10, or 16 h. Two hours prior to harvesting, the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine. The labeled cells were washed, lysed, and immunoprecipitated by using anti-CD38 moAb, as already described. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) after electrophoresis in SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 250 mM sucrose and 1 mM PMSF. The cells were lysed in this buffer by three freeze/thaw cycles and separated from lysate by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to sediment the membranes (19Nervi C. Grippo J.F. Sherman M.I. George M.D. Jetten A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5854-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF. Two-hundred-microliter aliquots (150–200 µg of protein) from each cytosolic and membrane fraction were used for the immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates from metabolically labeled HL-60 cells were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-CD38 moAb, IB4, or IB6, or with purified IgG fraction from rabbit anti-CD38 antiserum raised against CD38 synthetic peptide (C248-267). The antigen-antibody reaction was detected by using IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:5,000 diluted) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Corp.) as per the manufacturer's recommendation. For peptide mapping, the RA-treated HL-60 cells were metabolically labeled, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoresis, as already described. Following electrophoresis, 1-cm gel slices corresponding to the 190- and 45-kDa molecular masses were cut out and transferred individually into separate microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes were kept at −70°C for 30 min to freeze the gel slices. The frozen gel slices were homogenized and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The samples were stored overnight at 4°C to allow maximum recovery of the proteins. The supernatants were obtained by centrifugation, dialyzed against 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and lyophilized. The lyophilized samples (containing ≈105 cpm in each sample) were resuspended in 200 µl of SDS-containing sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The proteolytic cleavage of isolated radioactive proteins was performed at 37°C for 0, 2, 4, or 8 h with 1 µg/ml Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Glu-C, EC; Sigma), essentially as described earlier (20Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides generated as a result of V8 proteolysis were identified by subjecting the reactants to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analysis of the radioactive bands by PhosphorImager. The ability of purified CD38 protein to serve as a substrate for transglutaminase (TGase)-catalyzed cross-linking reactions was determined. The reaction was carried out at 37°C in 0.1 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 µCi of [3H]putrescine (specific activity 29.4 Ci/mmol DuPont NEN), 8 µg of purified CD38, and 0.5 µg purified guinea pig liver TGase (Sigma). At different time points, the Ca2+-dependent incorporation of [3H]putrescine into CD38 protein was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the reaction mixture, followed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Background values were obtained by substitution of 5 mM EGTA for CaCl2 in the reaction mixture. Alternatively, the purified CD38 protein (15 µg) was labeled (2.6 × 106 cpm/µg) with 0.5 mCi of 125I (Amersham Corp.), using IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce) and incubated in Tris-HCl-buffered saline (50 mM (pH 7.4)), containing 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 µg of purified TGase, and 5 mM CaCl2 or EGTA. After 15 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 10 × SDS sample buffer and boiling for 2 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed. In vivo effect of monodansylcadaverine (Sigma), a TGase-specific substrate inhibitor, was studied to determine the role of enzyme-catalyzed reactions on the accumulation of CD38 and p190. HL-60 cells were incubated with RA (0.1 µM) in the presence or absence of either 50 or 100 µM monodansylcadaverine for 8 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with IB4 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was probed with anti-CD38 moAb (IB4), as already described. The p190 was separated from CD38 in a two-step procedure consisting of anti-CD38 immunoaffinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. Five milliliters of desalted IgG fraction containing anti-CD38 moAb (4.6 mg of protein/ml) were conjugated to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gel was packed in a column (12 × 1.5 cm) and washed extensively with 0.1 M MOPS buffer to remove unbound IgG. The cell lysates (5–10 mg of protein) from RA-treated HL-60 cells were applied to the IB4-Affi-Gel column, and nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the gel with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M MOPS buffer (pH 7.5) and then with 50 ml of buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.8). The fractions (1 ml each) were neutralized, dialyzed overnight against 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and checked for the enzyme activity. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 0.2-ml volume using an Amicon Cell equipped with PM-10 membrane (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The concentrated fraction was subjected to gel filtration, using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equipped with a 200-µl superloop. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.15 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min; 1-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were analyzed for NADase activity, and the active fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining to determine the identity of proteins present in them. We used previously published fluorometric methods to determine the NADase (21Muller H.M. Muller C.D. Schuber F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 456-464Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and cyclase (22Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activities. NADase activity was determined by incubating the sample with 0.1 mM NAD+ at 37°C for 15 min in 0.1 ml of PBS. The cyclase activity was assayed by monitoring the conversion of nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) into cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR), essentially as described earlier (22Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each case the reaction was terminated by adding 100 µl of 5% SDS. Eight hundred microliters of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were then added to the reaction mixture, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 410-nm emission wavelength (excitation at 300 nm), using the RF-5000 Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The protein content in cell extracts and column fractions was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The enzyme activity was expressed as a net change in the fluorescence intensity/h/µg protein. Overnight incubation of HL-60 cells with RA (0.1 µM) resulted in a 30-fold higher NADase activity than in untreated control cells (Fig. 1A). A similar increase in NADase activity had been observed earlier in response to RA treatment in HL-60 and other myeloid cells (24Drach J. Zhao S. Malavasi F. Mehta K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Drach J. McQueen C. Engel H. Andreef M. Robertson K.A. Collins S.J. Malavasi F. Mehta K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1746-1752PubMed Google Scholar, 26Graeff R.M. Mehta K. Lee H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Kontani K. Nishina H. Ooka Y. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16895-16898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RA-induced increase in NADase activity was associated with a parallel increase in the synthesis and accumulation of CD38 protein. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled HL-60 cells, using a monospecific anti-CD38 moAb (IB4), revealed no significant levels of CD38 protein (45 kDa) in untreated cells (Fig. 1B, lane 1), but treatment of cells with RA (0.1 µM for 18 h) resulted in a marked increase in accumulation of CD38 protein (Fig. 1B, lane 2). In addition to the expected 45-kDa band, we detected a high molecular weight protein (p190) that coimmunoprecipitated with anti-CD38 moAb IB4 from RA-treated HL-60 cell lysates (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Similar bands of 45 and 190 kDa were obtained when two other anti-CD38 antibodies, IB6 (anti-CD38 moAb) and rabbit anti-CD38 peptide, were used for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These results suggested that CD38 may be an integral part of p190. To determine the relationship between p190 and CD38, we next studied the ability of purified CD38 protein to inhibit immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled bands by anti-CD38 moAb IB4. The inclusion of purified CD38 protein during the immunoprecipitation step almost completely blocked the appearance of 45- as well as 190-kDa radiolabeled bands (Fig. 1B, lane 3). These results suggested that p190 represents a high molecular weight precursor of CD38, a post-translationally modified cross-linked product of CD38, or a protein that is closely associated with CD38 and coimmunoprecipitates along with CD38. To test this further, we determined the kinetics of CD38 and p190 accumulation. The cell lysates from HL-60 cells after 2, 4, 6, 10, or 16 h of RA treatment were immunoprecipitated with IB4. Results shown in Fig. 2 suggest that accumulation of CD38 protein (45 kDa) precedes the accumulation of p190. A significant accumulation of CD38 protein was evident as early as 4 h after RA treatment (Fig. 2, lane 3). However, a comparable level of p190 accumulation was seen only after 6 h of treatment with RA, and thereafter both the proteins showed a comparable increase and accumulation with time for at least up to 10 h of treatment (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). Since CD38 appeared before p190, the latter cannot serve as a precursor for CD38 protein. On the contrary, p190 may represent a post-translational cross-linked product of CD38 protein. To test further whether p190 is a post-translational modified product of CD38, we determined the immunoreactivity of p190 to three different anti-CD38 antibodies that recognize different epitopes on the CD38 molecule. The immunoprecipitates (obtained by using the anti-CD38 moAb IB4) from untreated or RA-treated HL-60 cells were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then probed with anti-CD38 moAbs (IB4 or IB6) or rabbit anti-CD38 peptide antibody. The results shown in Fig. 3A revealed the presence of two strong immunoreactive bands at 45 and 190 kDa in the immunoprecipitates from RA-treated HL-60 cells when the blots were probed with moAb IB4 (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The other two antibodies, IB6 and anti-CD38 peptide antibody, showed equally strong immunoreactivity with these proteins (45 and 190 kDa) in a Western blot assay (data not shown). The immunoprecipitate from untreated HL-60 cells showed no or very poor immunoreactivity with IB4 (Fig. 3A, lane 1), IB6, or anti-CD38 peptide antibodies. These results strongly suggested that p190 is not a CD38-associated protein but may represent a post-translational modified product of CD38. To define further the relationship between CD38 and p190, we compared their peptide maps generated by limited proteolysis with V8 Staphylococcus aureus protease. Both CD38 and p190 were digested with V8 protease for various times in SDS-containing buffer as discussed under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 3B shows an autoradiogram of peptide maps obtained from CD38 and p190 after 0, 2, 4, or 8 h of V8 treatment at a 20:1 substrate:enzyme ratio (w:w). The comparison of CD38 and p190 peptide maps revealed the presence of several common peptide fragments ranging from 7.2 to 39 kDa (Fig. 3B; labeled ◂). Except for the 66-kDa peptide (Fig. 3B; labeled ≪), p190 yielded a peptide pattern identical to that of CD38 following its digestion with the V8 enzyme. It is interesting that the qualitative pattern of peptide fragments did not change significantly even after 8 h of digestion. Similarly, the complete digestion of CD38 and p190 could not be achieved even after prolonged digestion (8 h) with increasing concentrations of V8 protease (data not shown). These results suggest the high specificity of V8 protease for cleaving the peptide bond at a specific site (C-terminal of glutamic acid) under the experimental condition employed in our assay system. Furthermore, the strikingly similar peptide profiles strongly supported the contention that CD38 is an integral part of the p190 protein and may represent a covalently modified product of CD38. The induction of CD38 is a specific response of HL-60 cells to RA rather than a general response to differentiation (25Drach J. McQueen C. Engel H. Andreef M. Robertson K.A. Collins S.J. Malavasi F. Mehta K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1746-1752PubMed Google Scholar, 26Graeff R.M. Mehta K. Lee H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A similar specificity has been reported for induction of another enzyme, tissue TGase (28Davies P.J.A. Murtaugh M.P. Moore Jr., W.T. Johnson G.S. Lucas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5166-5174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, treatment of HL-60 cells with RA has been shown to induce a rapid and large accumulation of TGase that was not seen with other agents that induce HL-60 differentiation (28Davies P.J.A. Murtaugh M.P. Moore Jr., W.T. Johnson G.S. Lucas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5166-5174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGase is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme that catalyzes irreversible cross-linking of proteins by promoting the formation of isopeptide bonds between protein-bound glutamine and lysine residues (29Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Since there are 14 glutamine and 19 lysine residues in human CD38 protein, providing a total of 33 potential sites for cross-linking by TGase, it was tempting to speculate that CD38 could be a substrate for TGase. To test this notion, we next determined the ability of purified CD38 protein to serve as a substrate for TGase-catalyzed cross-linking reactions. Results shown in Fig. 4A suggested that CD38 could indeed serve as a suitable -acyl donor substrate for TGase-catalyzed reactions. Incubation of purified CD38 protein with Ca2+ and purified TGase (from guinea pig liver) resulted in an appreciable incorporation of [3H]putrescine. TGase-catalyzed incorporation of putrescine into CD38 was linear for at least up to 10 min of reaction (Fig. 4A) and was completely dependent on the presence of Ca2+. Replacing Ca2+ with EGTA in the reaction mixture fully inhibited the reaction (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the incorporation of putrescine into CD38 protein is mediated by TGase. To our knowledge there is no other Ca2+-dependent process by which putrescine could be incorporated into proteins. The ability of CD38 to serve as substrate for TGase was further tested by studying the post-translational changes, if any, induced by purified TGase. Results shown in Fig. 4B demonstrate that CD38, in the presence of TGase and Ca2+ (Fig. 4B, lane 1), undergoes heavy cross-linking into a high molecular weight form (≈190 kDa). TGase-mediated cross-linking of CD38 was completely inhibited when Ca2+ was replaced with EGTA in the reaction mixture (Fig. 4B, lane 2). These results suggested that p190 that coimmunoprecipitates with CD38 from RA-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 1) may be the product of TGase-catalyzed cross-linking of CD38 protein. Indeed the presence of monodansylcadaverine, a competitive inhibitor of TGase, in culture medium at 50 or 100 µM concentrations (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) almost completely prevented the RA-induced accumulation of p190 in HL-60 cells. The inhibitory effect of monodansylcadaverine on p190 accumulation was a specific rather than a trivial toxic effect, since the accumulation of CD38 protein (45 kDa) in RA-treated cells was not significantly affected by the presence or absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 4C). TGase has been shown to induce post-translational cross-linking of several proteins in tissues and body fluids (30Aeschlimann A. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the post-translational modification of phospholipase A2 and interleukin-2. TGase-mediated dimerization of phospholipase A2 has been shown to result in a 10-fold increase in its catalytic activity with respect to monomeric enzyme (31Cordella-Miele E. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17180-17188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, TGase-catalyzed dimerization of interleukin-2 has been shown to render this protein cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes (32Eitan S. Solomon A. Lavie V. Yoles E. Hirschberg D.L. Belkin M. Schwartz M. Science. 1994; 264: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, it was tempting to determine whether p190 has any altered catalytic functions when compared with CD38 protein. To test this, we purified p190 from CD38 protein by taking advantage of the fact that the two proteins differ substantially in their molecular masses. p190 and CD38 were isolated from RA-induced HL-60 cells in a two-step procedure, the anti-CD38 immunoaffinity column and size-exclusion chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The bound fraction obtained from the immunoaffinity column, when subjected to FPLC gel filtration, yielded two fractions containing NADase activity with elution volumes of 5 ml (Fig. 5A, fraction a) and 15 ml (Fig. 5A, fraction b), respectively. Electrophoresis of the first active fraction (fraction a) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions revealed the presence of a major band at the 190-kDa position (Fig. 5B, lane 2), whereas the second active fraction (fraction b) showed a single band of 45-kDa size, as determined by silver staining (Fig. 5B, lane 1). Enzymatic assay of fractions obtained from the size-exclusion chromatography revealed the presence of a low NAD-glycohydrolase activity in the p190 fraction (Fig. 5A). Since CD38 also displays ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity (13Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan L.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C.

Zocchi E. Guida L. Franco L. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it was necessary to determine the cyclase activity in the p190 fraction. For this purpose, we took advantage of a recently described fluorometric assay. This assay is based on the fluorescence properties of cGDPR, produced from a nonfluorescent NGD+ substrate by Aplysia cyclase and human CD38-catalyzed reaction (22Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Graeff R.M. Mehta K. Lee H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, cGDPR, unlike cADPR, is a poor substrate for the hydrolase activity of CD38 (22Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GDP-ribose is not fluorescent. To determine the presence of cyclase activity in the p190 fraction, both p190- and CD38-containing fractions were incubated with 0.1 mM NGD+ at 37°C to induce cyclization reaction, and the fluorescence emission was then determined at 410 nm. It was interesting that the p190 fraction (Fig. 5A, fraction a) showed markedly different catalytic properties from the fraction containing CD38 (Fig. 5A, fraction b). The former showed three times more GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity than CD38; the difference in the ratio of cyclase to hydrolase activity was even more striking for the two proteins (Table I). These results further supported the premise that CD38 may become intimately associated with some critical stimulatory subunits under physiological conditions, accounting for not only the enzymatic activity associated with p190 but also the altered cyclase to hydrolase activity. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies by Tohgo et al. (33Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugiomoto T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28555-28557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the two cysteines present in the human CD38 molecule at positions 119 and 201 play a critical role in the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR (33Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugiomoto T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28555-28557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, C119K- and/or C201E-mutated CD38 exhibited only ribosyl cyclase activity (33Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugiomoto T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28555-28557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these observations, it is tempting to speculate that the preferential cyclase activity associated with p190 may result from the masking of these two cysteine residues in the CD38 molecule. It is also apparent that a region distinct from the active site is involved in post-translational modification of CD38, giving it a conformation more suitable for cyclase activity.Table I.Determination of cyclase and NADase activity in crude cell extracts and purified fractionsGDP-ribosyl cyclaseaThe enzyme activities are expressed as a net change in fluorescence (excitation 300 nm, emission 410 nm) produced by 1.0 µg of protein during 1-h reaction.,bThe data shown represent the average ± S.D. of three independent observations.NAD glycohydrolaseaThe enzyme activities are expressed as a net change in fluorescence (excitation 300 nm, emission 410 nm) produced by 1.0 µg of protein during 1-h reaction.,bThe data shown represent the average ± S.D. of three independent observations.GDP-ribosyl cyclase/NADase ratioUntreated HL-60 cell lysates0.16 ± 0.020.22 ± 0.020.72RA-treated HL-60 cell lysate4.4 ± 0.086.2 ± 0.160.71CD38 (45 kDa)229.2 ± 6.0438.8 ± 4.00.52CD38 (p190)696.0 ± 14.4174.8 ± 2.44.04a The enzyme activities are expressed as a net change in fluorescence (excitation 300 nm, emission 410 nm) produced by 1.0 µg of protein during 1-h reaction.b The data shown represent the average ± S.D. of three independent observations. Open table in a new tab The enzymatic activities of CD38 are exclusively confined to its extracellular domain (13Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan L.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). This raises a question regarding the physiological source of its substrate, NAD+. One possibility is that following some stimulus, CD38 may become internalized and act intracellularly. Since dimerization or oligomerization upon interaction with specific ligands is a prerequisite for subsequent internalization of certain receptors (34Greenlund A.C. Schreiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Pennica D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18103-18110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cochet C. Kashles O. Chambaz E.M. Borrello I. King C.P. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3290-3295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next determined whether modification of CD38 into a high molecular weight form (p190) could lead to its internalization. The membrane fractions from untreated and RA-treated HL-60 cells were obtained and immunoprecipitated by using moAb IB4. Results shown in Fig. 6 demonstrated that p190 was localized exclusively in the plasma membrane and thus may not necessarily represent a pathway for CD38 internalization. In conclusion, the TGase-catalyzed post-translational cross-linking of the CD38 protein may represent an important in vivo mechanism for regulating the catalytic functions of this bifunctional enzyme. The preferential ability of p190 to convert NAD+ into cADPR (cyclase activity), a potent inducer of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, suggests a role for this protein in cADPR-dependent cellular events. Since intracellular Ca2+ is a key factor in such important cell signaling pathways as cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and activation, it is likely that p190 is responsible for mediating some of these cellular events.

https://openalex.org/W1542404998,"Saturable binding of various inhaled anesthetics to serum albumin has been shown with a variety of approaches. In order to determine the location of halothane binding sites in serum albumin, both human and bovine serum albumins (HSA and BSA) were photolabeled with [14C]halothane, and subjected to proteolysis and microsequencing. BSA was found to have a higher affinity for halothane than HSA, and it contained two specifically labeled sites. One site was characterized by diffuse labeling from Trp212-Leu217, and the other by a more discrete and higher affinity labeling at Trp134-Gly135. HSA contained only a single labeled site, and although lower affinity, was determined to be analogous to BSA Trp212. The position 130–140 region of HSA, having a leucine instead of tryptophan at position 134, was not labeled. These results demonstrate specific and discrete binding of an inhaled anesthetic to a mammalian-soluble protein, and further suggest the importance of aromatic residues as one feature of inhaled anesthetic binding sites."

Furthermore, we determined that the coding region of ZNF74 gene lies a few kilobases proximal to a polymorphic marker (D22S264) (10Marineau C. Aubry M. Julien J.P. Rouleau G.A.

The involvement of the 22q11.2-deleted genes in DGS or other related disorders remains to be more directly addressed through genetic studies and functional characterization of their protein products. ZNF74 is a member of the Cys2/His2 (C2H2) class of zinc finger genes, which constitutes the largest family of genes encoding potential transcription factors. The C2H2 zinc finger motif corresponds to the consensus sequence: -CysX2,4-Cys-X3-Phe-X5-Leu-X2-His-X3,4-His-, where Xn,m denotes the presence of n or m amino acids between conserved residues; the cysteines and histidines coordinating the zinc are in bold and the conserved amino acids forming the link between consecutive fingers are underlined. The first described C2H2 zinc finger-containing protein was an abundant oocyte protein from the frog Xenopus called TFIIIA (19Pelham H.R. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). The zinc finger motif was subsequently identified in Drosophila genes such as Kruppel, and a search for homologues was undertaken in mammals (21Schuh R. Aicher W. Gaul U. Cote S. Preiss A. Maier D.

It is now estimated that between 300 and 700 human genes encode zinc finger proteins of the C2H2 TFIIIA/Kruppel type (24Klug A. Schwabe J.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Most studied C2H2 zinc finger proteins were found to bind to specific DNA sequences and to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression (25Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Molnar G. Crozat A. Pardee A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5242-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Hagen G. Muller S.

However, a small subset of multifinger proteins from Xenopus bind also RNA such as TFIIIA, while others bind only RNA such as p43, Xfin, and some members of the FAR subfamily of zinc finger proteins (e.g. XFG 5–1) (30Theunissen O.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3087-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Noticeably, TFIIIA is the only known characterized zinc finger protein with a dual role of DNA- and RNA-binding protein (30Theunissen O. Rudt F. Guddat U. Mentzel H. Pieler T. Cell. 1992; 71: 679-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is a specific transcription factor that binds to and activates transcription of genes coding for the 5 S ribosomal RNA. By also binding to the 5 S RNA itself, TFIIIA participates in the transport of this RNA molecule from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and in its storage prior to ribosome assembly (30Theunissen O. Rudt F. Guddat U. Mentzel H. Pieler T. Cell. 1992; 71: 679-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Guddat U. Bakken A.H. Pieler T. Cell. 1990; 60: 619-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). While base-specific recognition by individual zinc fingers is the driving force in DNA binding, it is thought that it is more the RNA secondary/tertiary structure than its primary structure that determines RNA-protein interactions (30Theunissen O. Rudt F. Guddat U. Mentzel H. Pieler T. Cell. 1992; 71: 679-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 38Predki P.F. Nayak L.M. Gottlieb M.B. Regan L. Cell. 1995; 80: 41-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Zinc finger proteins of the C2H2 family can be subdivided into at least four subfamilies based on the presence and identity of evolutionary conserved domains located at the amino terminus of the coding region. These different domains are known as: FAX (inger-ssociated Boes) (39Knochel W. Poting A. Koster M. Baradi T. Nietfeld W. Bouwmeester T. Pieler T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6097-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), FAR (inger-ssociated epeats) (35Klocke B. Koster M. Hille S. Bouwmeester T. Bohm S. Pieler T. Knochel W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), POZ (x virus and inc fingers, also known as ZiN) (40Numoto M. Niwa O. Kaplan J. Wong K.K. Merrell K. Kamiya K. Yanagihara K. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 41Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), and KRAB (uppel-ssociated ox) (42Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). About one-third of the hundred zinc finger genes of the mammalian genome are estimated by hybridization to contain a KRAB domain, but very few of their corresponding encoded proteins have been studied. The KRAB domain (about 75 amino acids) is a conserved motif found in all eukaryotes from yeast to humans. It has been recently demonstrated that the KRAB domain can confer distance-independent transcriptional repression when fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor (43Witzgall R.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that ZNF74 is a human zinc finger gene of the KRAB subfamily whose protein product is a nuclear matrix-attached protein exhibiting RNA binding activity. Furthermore, we show that the zinc finger domain exerts at least a dual function, being responsible for the RNA binding properties and for the nuclear targeting of ZNF74 protein. The previously isolated 2.4-kb ZNF74-1 cDNA cloned in pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for preparing the various ZNF74 constructs (9Aubry M. Demczuk S. Desmaze C. Aikem M. Aurias A. Julien J.P. Rouleau G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When convenient restriction sites were not available, selected fragments where amplified by PCR using VentR DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and cloned in the appropriate vectors (48Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). To eliminate sequence errors potentially introduced by the polymerase, large regions of the PCR-amplified inserts were substituted by cloning with corresponding restriction fragments from ZNF74-1 cDNA. Furthermore, PCR-derived regions remaining unsubstituted as well as cloning junctions were sequenced in all constructs. ZNF74-1 cDNA as well as two newly isolated cDNAs ZNF74-2a and ZNF74-2b, which formed a composite 3.8-kb cDNA called ZNF74-2 were obtained from a 23-week human fetal brain library as described before (9Aubry M. Demczuk S. Desmaze C. Aikem M. Aurias A. Julien J.P. Rouleau G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Their sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using the Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemistry Corp.) The use of a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase step to extend prematurely interrupted sequencing products (49DeShazer D. Wood G.E. Friedman R.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 288-290PubMed Google Scholar) and/or the resolution of sequencing products on highly denaturing urea/formamide gels (50Kapelner S.N. Turner R.T. Sarkar G. Bolander M.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 64-67PubMed Google Scholar) were in some cases required to eliminate sequencing artefacts observed in some strong GC compression areas. To deduce the exon/intron structure of the ZNF74 gene, exon fragments or oligonucleotide primer sequences derived from ZNF74 cDNAs were positioned on previously isolated cosmid clones containing ZNF74 genomic DNA (9Aubry M. Demczuk S. Desmaze C. Aikem M. Aurias A. Julien J.P. Rouleau G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the various cDNA probes and primers were hybridized to a Southern blot of ZNF74 cosmid clones digested with various restriction enzymes. To confirm the position of exons, subcloned EcoRI fragments derived from ZNF74 cosmid clones were sequenced along their exonic regions and at exon/intron boundaries. For in vitro transcription, the 3.8-kb ZNF74-2 cDNA and the 2.4-kb ZNF74-1 cDNA or its various truncated versions designed to eliminate from one to three of the first in frame methionines (ATG at positions 163–165, 259–261, and 364–366) were cloned into the HindIII or SmaI site of the pSP64 poly(A) transcription vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For such cloning, ZNF74-2 cDNA or sequences derived from ZNF74-1 cDNA and encoding the first three (nt 1-2144 or nt 125-2144), the second and third (nt 222-2144), the third (nt 285-2144), or none of the first three methionines (nt 367-2144) were obtained by digestion with restriction enzymes or by PCR amplification. [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were synthesized from pSP64 poly(A) constructs by using a TNT™ coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) as indicated by the manufacturer. To generate bacterially expressed full-length and truncated ZNF74 as fusion proteins with MBP, we used pMAL-c vector (New England Biolabs). PCR fragments were amplified from ZNF74-1 cDNA and subcloned in frame in the XbaI site of pMAL-c using primers containing an XbaI site. The various MBP fusion proteins described below include ZNF74 amino acid domains identical to the ones illustrated for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged proteins in Fig. 10. The various constructs obtained correspond to the full-length 572-amino acid coding region (nt 163-1881; MBP-ZNF74-(aa 1–572)), the zinc finger region (nt 685-1689; MBP-Zn-(aa 175–509)) and the C-terminal non-zinc finger region (nt 1696-1881; MBP-C-(aa 512–572)). A 1.9-kb EcoRI restriction fragment (nt 478-2416) corresponding to the complete coding region less the first 105 amino acids was subcloned in the EcoRI site of pMAL-c vector (MBP-ZNF74-(aa 106–572)). When no inserts are cloned in the polylinker site of pMAL-c, this vector generates an MBP-β-gal-α fusion (51 kDa). Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) transformed with pMAL-c fusion constructs were grown to an A600 of 0.4-0.6 and induced with 0.3 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Crude soluble extracts containing the soluble MBP fusion proteins were prepared from bacterial cells resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 µM ZnCl2, and 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol) (51Riggs P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 16.6.1Google Scholar). When required, MBP fusion proteins from these extracts were immobilized on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) (51Riggs P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 16.6.1Google Scholar). Other ZNF74 hybrid proteins were initially made by fusion with glutathione S-transferase in pGEX vectors (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), but the resulting proteins were all recovered in inclusion bodies as insoluble proteins. Crude bacterial extracts containing 0.5-2 µg of MBP fusion proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. One half of the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the other half was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The washed membranes were probed for 30–45 min at 25°C with 5–10 µCi of 65ZnCl2 (41 Ci/g; Du Pont Canada, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario) in 10 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 essentially as described by Makowski (52Makowski G.S. Lin S.M. Brenman S.M. Smilowitz H.M. Hopfer S.M. Sunderman F.J. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1991; 29: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In competition experiments, 0.01 mM ZnCl2 was included during the probing and the subsequent washing steps. The washed and dried membranes were exposed at −70°C with intensifying screens for 2–10 h. At last, the membranes were stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid and destained with water to confirm the efficiency of the protein transfer. The MBP fusion proteins were affinity-purified on an amylose resin (New England Biolabs) as described by the manufacturer, and the proteins immobilized on the resin were used for RNA binding analysis. Control experiments were done using MBP-β-gal-α fusion or a fusion protein corresponding to MBP linked to the C-terminal non-zinc finger portion of ZNF74 (MBP-C-(aa512-aa572)). RNA homopolymers (Sigma) were 5′-end-labeled as described by Koster et al. (36Koster M. Kuhn U. Bouwmeester T. Nietfeld W. El-Baradi T. Knochel W. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3087-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As determined by the manufacturer, the average molecular weights of RNA homopolymers vary from lot to lot. For the lots used, the average molecular weights were 102,000 for poly(U) and 384,000 for poly(G), and the molecular weights varied from 260,000 to 1,200,000 for poly(C) and from 100,000 to 1,700,000 for poly(A). The amylose resin (50 µl/assay) with immobilized fusion protein (0.5-2 µg) was incubated with 100 ng of radioactive homopolymer RNA ((2 × 103) − (1 × 104) cpm/ng) in a total volume 400 µl of binding buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 µM ZnCl2, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) in the presence or absence of competitor RNA or DNA (sonicated salmon sperm) for 30 min at room temperature. Bovine serum albumin (10 µg/assay) was added to the binding buffer to reduce nonspecific binding. After RNA binding, the amylose beads were washed 3 times with 0.75 ml of binding buffer at 4°C. Radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. RNA homopolymers binding to the MBP-β-gal-α- or MBP-C-(aa512-572) controls was similar to the background binding observed on the amylose resin alone. In some experiments, the ionic strength was varied by increasing the NaCl concentration of the binding buffer from 50 mM to 1 M; these salt conditions did not affect the binding of the MBP fusion protein to the amylose resin (not shown). For all the experiments presented in this paper, the amount of labeled poly(U) and poly(G) used in the RNA binding assay (100 ng) was near the concentration required to have half of the sites saturated as determined in saturation experiments using from 10 ng to 1 µg of labeled homopolymers. The binding of 100 ng of homopolymer RNA to increasing concentrations of fusion protein was quantified (up to 40–60% of input RNA could be retained after washing), and the amount of MBP-ZNF74-(aa 106–572) protein used in the described experiments was fixed to have always less than 10–20% of the input labeled RNA bound. MBP fusion protein extracts can be stored at −20°C over a period of several weeks without loss of specific binding activities. Various coding fragments of ZNF74-1 cDNA were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCGN (53Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes an N-terminal HA epitope tag under the control of the cytomegalovirus promotor. The HA epitope can be recognized by the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (54Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Walker L.E. Reisfeld R.A. Wilson I.A. Hogle J.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4949-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). ZNF74 fragments were amplified by PCR with primers containing an XbaI site for cloning into the XbaI site of pCGN. These fragments correspond to the full 572-amino acid coding region (nt 163-1881; HA-ZNF74-(aa 1–572)), the first 190 N-terminal amino acids (nt 163–732; HA-N-(aa 1–190)), the zinc finger region (nt 685-1689; HA-Zn-(aa 175–509)), the C-terminal last 61 amino acids (nt 1696-1881; HA-C-(aa 512–572)) as well as HA-ZNF74ΔKrab-(aa 68–572) (nt 364-1881), HA-NΔKrabZn-(aa68-509) (nt 364-1689), and HA-ZnC-(aa 175–572) (nt 685-1881) (see Fig. 10). The HA-β-galactosidase fusion construct was obtain by subcloning the β-galactosidase (starting with Val at position 8; 55Kalnins A. Otto K. Ruther U. Muller-Hill B.

HA-β-galactosidase-ZNF74-(aa 1–572) and HA-β-galactosidase-Zn-(aa 175–509) were obtained by first subcloning the ZNF74 full-length fragment (nt 163-1881) and ZNF74 zinc finger region (nt 658-1689), respectively, as XbaI-blunted fragments into the NdeI site lying just 5′ to the β-galactosidase stop codon. Subconfluent African green monkey COS-7 or human HeLa cells plated in 1 × 2-cm four-well Lab-Tek™ (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were transfected with the various plasmid constructs (2 µg) (56Colbere-Garapin F.

About 30–36 h after transfection, intact cells or monolayers of cells at different stages of nuclear matrix preparation (see below) were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Tween-20 for 1 h, treated sequentially with 50 mM NH4Cl and with 0.2% cold fish gelatin for 30 min, and then processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (57Zahs K.R.

The secondary fluorescent isothiocyanate rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was used at a 1:100 dilution. The DNA was stained by a 5-min treatment with 2.5 µg/ml Hoescht 33258 fluorochrome (Sigma).

Mutant p70, which lacked 50 amino acids at the C-terminus, failed to interact with the 11-kDa RPA subunit (p11) and, when deleted further at the C terminus, was unable to interact with either the 34-kDa subunit (p34) or with p11, suggesting that p70 directly interacts with both p34 and p11.

INTRODUCTIONThe control of cell proliferation in eukaryotes is a complex process involving the sequential activation and inactivation of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases known as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). 1The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinasePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenPCRpolymerase chain reaction. The activity of these enzymes is controlled by their association with a series of regulatory subunits called cyclins (Morgan, 27Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar; Pines, 33Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies from different groups have led to the identification of a family of proteins with ability to bind to the diverse cyclin-CDK complexes and to inhibit their activity (Peter and Herskowitz, 32Peter M. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1994; 79: 181-184Google Scholar; Sherr and Roberts, 37Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Google Scholar; Hirama and Koeffler, 16Hirama T. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1995; 86: 841-854Google Scholar). At present, a total of seven negative regulators of the cell cycle have been isolated and characterized at the amino acid sequence level, being the one called p21 the first to be identified (Xiong et al., 45Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366 (a): 701-704Google Scholar). p21, also known as WAF1 (wild type p53 activated fragment-1) (El-Deiry et al., 9El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar), CIP1 (cyclin-dependent kinases interacting protein-1) (Harper et al., 15Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar), or SDI1 (senescent cell-derived inhibitor-1) (Noda et al. 30Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Google Scholar), is a nuclear arginine-rich protein that inhibits the activity of all CDKs, preventing phosphorylation of their corresponding substrates and blocking cell-cycle transition from G1 to S phase.The expression of the p21 gene is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53 (El-Deiry et al., 9El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar), a transcription factor that controls the arrest of cell cycle progression at G1 checkpoint in response to DNA damage, thus preventing replication of damaged templates while allowing appropriate DNA repair (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 42Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Google Scholar; Ullrich et al., 41Ullrich S.J. Anderson C.W. Mercer W.E. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15259-15262Google Scholar; Levine, 19Levine A.J.

A series of recent findings have reinforced the idea that p21 serves as a key effector of cell-cycle arrest pathways (El-Deiry et al., 9El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R.

Jacks T. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Google Scholar). Thus, introduction of wild type p21 into a number of different tumor cell lines caused growth suppression, whereas transfection with a p21 cDNA mutant directing the synthesis of a truncated protein, resulted in loss of the ability of p21 to suppress growth of these tumor cells in vitro. In addition, p21 expression has been found to be stimulated by DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation in cells with a wild type p53 gene but not in cells harboring deletions or missense mutations in the p53 gene. Finally, whole-body irradiation of normal and p53 (−/−) mice, caused a marked increase in the levels of p21 mRNA in most wild type tissues but not in p53 deficient tissues. However, and although these results indicate that p21 is an essential part of the p53-mediated growth arrest pathway elicited by DNA damage, p21 can be also regulated independently of p53 in several situations including normal tissue development and cellular differentiation in response to appropriate signals like TGF-β, MyoD, phorbol esters, or retinoic acid (Michieli et al., 25Michieli P.

Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 4971-4974Google Scholar).In addition to its well established role as a general CDK inhibitor, p21 also complexes in vitro with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an essential DNA polymerase δ auxilliary factor that greatly enhances its processivity (Waga et al., 43Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Google Scholar; Flores-Rozas et al., 11Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z-Q. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Google Scholar). On the basis of these binding properties, it has been proposed that p21 can directly inhibit DNA replication in a way that appears to be independent of its cyclin-CDK inhibitory properties. Interestingly, p21 binding to PCNA results in the inhibition of the role of this auxilliary factor in DNA replication but not in nucleotide excision-repair, thus allowing growth-arrest while permitting active repair of damaged DNA (Li et al., 20Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Google Scholar; Shivji et al., 39Shivji M.K.K. Grey S.J. Strausfeld U.P. Wood R.D. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1062-1068Google Scholar).Taking into account this essential role of p21 as a downstream mediator of the cell cycle arrest induced by p53 as well as its direct role as an inhibitor of DNA replication, it is tempting to speculate that mutations in this gene might be involved in the development or progression of human cancers. In addition and because at present the precise mechanisms of inhibition of CDKs and PCNA interaction are not yet completely elucidated, functional analysis of putative p21 mutants could be important to define specific residues or protein domains that could be relevant for the biological activity of this protein. In this work, we show the identification of a p21 mutant present in a human breast carcinoma and characterized by the replacement of arginine at position 94 with a tryptophan residue. We have also performed a functional analysis of the mutant protein with the finding that the identified mutation impairs the ability of p21 to inhibit CDKs.DISCUSSIONIn this work we have performed a molecular analysis of the p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 gene in a series of 36 primary breast carcinomas with the finding of a single tumor specific mutation. This mutation results in the substitution of a tryptophan for an arginine residue at position 94 of the amino acid sequence previously determined for this CDK inhibitor. Furthermore, and because the only p21 mutation reported to date was found in a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Bhatia et al., 3Bhatia K. Fan S. Spangler G. Weintraub M. O'Connor P.M. Judde J.-G. Magrath I. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1431-1435Google Scholar), this work represents to our knowledge the first description of a p21 mutation in a primary tumor.In an attempt to examine the possible functional consequences of the R94W mutation, we have performed an analysis of the different biochemical properties of the identified p21 mutant, including studies of binding and inhibition of different cyclin-CDK complexes, examination of putative variations in its role as positive regulator of the cell cycle, and finally analysis of potential alterations in its binding properties to PCNA. These functional studies have revealed that the mutant protein is substantially impaired (between 5- and 10-fold) in its ability to inhibit a series of cyclin-CDK complexes, including cyclin A-CDK2, cyclin D1-CDK6, cyclin D-CDK4, and cyclin B-CDC2. Because residue 94 lies outside the minimal extent of the proposed CDK inhibitory domain (residues 1–80, Polyak et al., 34Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massagué J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Google Scholar), it is possible that this alteration has its effect on the overall structure of p21 rather than on a specific binding site within the protein. In this regard, it should be also noted that the Arg residue at position 94 is absolutely conserved in the amino acid sequence determined for the p21 protein from different strains of mice, including distantly related species (El-Deiry et al., 9El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar; Huppi et al., 17Huppi K. Siwarski D. Dosik J. Michieli P. Chedid M. Reed S. Mock B. Givol D. Mushinski J.F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3017-3020Google Scholar). This observation provides additional support for the potential relevance of this specific residue for the CDK inhibitory role of p21.In contrast to the observed impairment of the p21R94W mutant in its CDK-inhibitory ability, this protein was unaltered in its ability to promote cyclin-CDK association, suggesting that the R94W mutation preferentially affected the inhibitory role of p21 while leaving any possible function as a kinase activator intact. Similarly, p21 and p21R94W were virtually identical in their ability to bind PCNA, and thus the mutant may retain the ability to inhibit replicative DNA synthesis. The finding that PCNA binding properties are not altered in the p21R94W mutant is consistent with results from different groups demonstrating that the CDK and PCNA inhibitory activities of p21 are functionally independent and reside in separate protein domains (Chen et al., 5Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Google Scholar; Luo et al., 23Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Google Scholar; Nakanishi et al., 29Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17060-17063Google Scholar; Warbrick et al., 44Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Google Scholar). A more detailed analysis of the p21 structure has shown that the PCNA inhibitory function is localized at the C-terminal domain of the protein, being of particular relevance in this regard the region comprising residues 141–155 (Nakanishi et al., 29Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17060-17063Google Scholar). The finding that the p21 mutation identified in this work lies outside of the PCNA inhibitory domain provides additional explanation to our observation that p21R94W has only affected its CDK inhibitory properties without showing any detectable alteration on its ability to bind PCNA. Finally, it should be mentioned that experiments directed to clarify whether the R94W mutation primarily effects binding to the cyclin-CDK complex have not provided definitive answers. Consequently, additional competition experiments between wild type and mutant p21 will be necessary to detect and quantitate the putative differences in binding affinities between both molecules.In summary, the discovery of a tumor-specific mutation that impairs the ability of p21 to inhibit CDKs suggests that inactivation of p21 may somewhat contribute to neoplastic transformation. However, the results of mutational analysis of this gene in different cancer types appear to indicate that p21 mutations in human tumors will be rare events (Chedid et al., 4Chedid M. Michieli P. Lengel C. Huppi K. Givol D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3021-3024Google Scholar; Shiohara et al., 38Shiohara M. El-Deiry W. Wada M. Nakamaki T. Takeuchi S. Yang R. Chen D.-L. Vogelstein B. Koeffler H.P.

Lee P.D. Malkin D. Bull S.B. Andrulis L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1089-1092Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that loss of its function will be most often a consequence of inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 rather than the result of genetic alteration in its own structure. In this regard, it should be mentioned that recent studies from different groups have converged in the elucidation of the mechanisms by which this tumor suppressor guards normal cells against genetic damage (see Cox and Lane (6Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 501-508Google Scholar) for a review). Thus, p53 enforces cell cycle arrest via transcriptional induction of p21 expression (El-Deiry et al., 10El-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Wiman K.G. Mercer W.E. Kastan M.B. Kohn K.W. Elledge S.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Google Scholar), elicites apoptosis through induction of the Bax gene (Miyashita and Reed, 26Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Google Scholar), and enhances DNA repair via induction of GADD45 (Smith et al., 40Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.-Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr A.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1375-1380Google Scholar). Therefore, and although loss of the p21 pathway in the p53 response may contribute in some cases to neoplastic transformation, the frequent inactivation of p53 in human cancer must reflect simultaneous loss of multiple regulatory pathways. In fact, and according to recent data (Deng et al., 7Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Google Scholar; Brugarolas et al., 2Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Google Scholar), mice lacking p21, despite being defective in G1 checkpoint control, have not developed spontaneous malignancies during the first 7 months of observation, suggesting that p53-dependent suppression of early tumor formation is independent of p21.

In addition, recent studies from different groups have led to the identification of a family of proteins with ability to bind to the diverse cyclin-CDK complexes and to inhibit their activity (Peter and Herskowitz, 32Peter M.

Thus, introduction of wild type p21 into a number of different tumor cell lines caused growth suppression, whereas transfection with a p21 cDNA mutant directing the synthesis of a truncated protein, resulted in loss of the ability of p21 to suppress growth of these tumor cells in vitro. In addition, p21 expression has been found to be stimulated by DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation in cells with a wild type p53 gene but not in cells harboring deletions or missense mutations in the p53 gene. Finally, whole-body irradiation of normal and p53 (−/−) mice, caused a marked increase in the levels of p21 mRNA in most wild type tissues but not in p53 deficient tissues. However, and although these results indicate that p21 is an essential part of the p53-mediated growth arrest pathway elicited by DNA damage, p21 can be also regulated independently of p53 in several situations including normal tissue development and cellular differentiation in response to appropriate signals like TGF-β, MyoD, phorbol esters, or retinoic acid (Michieli et al., 25Michieli P.

Chem. 1995; 270 (a): 4971-4974Google Scholar).In addition to its well established role as a general CDK inhibitor, p21 also complexes in vitro with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an essential DNA polymerase δ auxilliary factor that greatly enhances its processivity (Waga et al., 43Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Google Scholar; Flores-Rozas et al., 11Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z-Q. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Google Scholar). On the basis of these binding properties, it has been proposed that p21 can directly inhibit DNA replication in a way that appears to be independent of its cyclin-CDK inhibitory properties. Interestingly, p21 binding to PCNA results in the inhibition of the role of this auxilliary factor in DNA replication but not in nucleotide excision-repair, thus allowing growth-arrest while permitting active repair of damaged DNA (Li et al., 20Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Google Scholar; Shivji et al., 39Shivji M.K.K. Grey S.J. Strausfeld U.P. Wood R.D. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1062-1068Google Scholar).Taking into account this essential role of p21 as a downstream mediator of the cell cycle arrest induced by p53 as well as its direct role as an inhibitor of DNA replication, it is tempting to speculate that mutations in this gene might be involved in the development or progression of human cancers. In addition and because at present the precise mechanisms of inhibition of CDKs and PCNA interaction are not yet completely elucidated, functional analysis of putative p21 mutants could be important to define specific residues or protein domains that could be relevant for the biological activity of this protein. In this work, we show the identification of a p21 mutant present in a human breast carcinoma and characterized by the replacement of arginine at position 94 with a tryptophan residue. We have also performed a functional analysis of the mutant protein with the finding that the identified mutation impairs the ability of p21 to inhibit CDKs."

On the other hand, the Lewis phenotyping of erythrocytes and secretory glands revealed the Le(a+b+) and partial Secretor phenotypes in selected Polynesian and Asian individuals (11Henry S.M.

The molecular basis of weak Secretor phenotypes, whether weak Se-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase is encoded by an altered Se gene or a gene other than H and Se, has yet to be determined.Recently, aberrant α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity, which synthesized Leb from Lea or Ley from the Lex determinant, or both, was found in cancer cells and tissues, suggesting the possibility of a third distinct α1,2-fucosyltransferase gene (13Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Sarnesto A. Thurin Y. Hindsgaul O. Koprowski H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Yazawa S. Nakamura J. Asao T. Nagamachi Y. Sagi M. Matta K.L. Tachikawa T. Akamatsu M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the rabbit, the possibility of a third type of α1,2-fucosyltransferase was suggested by immunohistochemical studies on DRG neurons. We recently cloned two types of rabbit α1,2-fucosyltransferase, RFT-I and RFT-II, showing that RFT-I but not RFT-II is expressed in postnatal rabbit brain (15Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8844-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RFT-I shows comparable affinities to types 1, 2, and 3 acceptors, which suggests that the binding specificity of RFT-I is primarily restricted to the terminal β-D-Gal residues of acceptors. In rabbit DRG neurons, fucosyl GM1 (type 3 H) is readily detected immunohistochemically on embryonic day 25, followed by the appearance of UEA-1 lectin-reactive antigens (type 2 H) postnatally (16Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Kanazawa I. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Kusunoki S. Chiba A. Shimizu T. Kanazawa I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). UEA-1 lectin-reactive antigens of DRG neurons in postnatal rabbits could be formed through fucosylation catalyzed by RFT-I. In contrast, fucosyl GM1 observed in DRG neurons of embryonic day 25 rabbits might not be the product of RFT-I because UEA-1 lectin-reactive antigens are not detected at that stage. This observation suggests the existence of another type of α1,2-fucosyltransferase that catalyzes preferential fucosylation to type 3 rather than type 2 glycochains.Here we report the molecular cloning of a third type of rabbit α1,2-fucosyltransferase, which could synthesize fucosyl GM1. This is the first direct evidence that, at least in one mammalian species, three active α1,2-fucosyltransferases exist.DISCUSSIONIn this and previous work (15Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8844-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) we reported the molecular cloning of three types of rabbit α1,2-fucosyltransferase, RFT-I, −II, and −III. These results constitute direct evidence that, at least in one mammalian species, three active α1,2-fucosyltransferases exist, one H type and two Se types, based on kinetic analysis.RFT-I exhibits comparable kinetic properties and significant structural homology with human H-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase, indicating that RFT-I is a counterpart of human H. RFT-II and −III show higher affinity to types 1 and 3 acceptors than to type 2 acceptors and phenyl-β-D-Gal. The kinetic parameters of RFT-II and −III are comparable with those of human Se-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase (2Kumazaki T. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4193-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Le Pendu J. Cartron J.P. Lemieux R.U. Oriol R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 749-760PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sarnesto A. Köhlin T. Hindsgaul O. Thurin J. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2737-2744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RFT-II and −III genes share remarkably conserved base pair sequence in the putative active domain (95%) as compared with the RFT-I gene. RFT-II and −III are thought to constitute Se-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase family. A recent report (10Kelly R.J. Rouquier S. Giorgi D. Lennon G.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4640-4649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) of the molecular cloning of human Se gene enables us to compare it with RFT-II and −III genes, as it was revealed that RFT-III exhibits higher amino acid identity with human Se than RFT-II. These findings led us to conclude that RFT-III is a counterpart of the human Se.The RFT-I, −II, and −III genes are assigned within approximately 90 kb, both RFT-II and −III genes being located in 3′ region of RFT-I, based on the results of pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The physical relationship of the RFT-I, −II, and −III genes are consistent with that of the human H, Se, and Sec1, α1,2-fucosyltransferase-related pseudogenes (22Rouquier S. Lowe J.B. Kelly R.J. Fertitta A.L. Lennon G.G. Giorgi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RFT-II corresponds to the human Sec1 gene. This idea is further supported by the structural analysis showing that the putative cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem domains of RFT-II and human Sec1 are well conserved as compared with other α1,2-fucosyltransferases (Table I). In this case, an ancestral Se gene is thought to have been duplicated into two related genes, one of which was subsequently inactivated by the frameshift mutations in humans. Site-directed point mutation analysis of the Sec1 gene, which corrects the frameshift, and kinetic studies on α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity of the mutants will provide further information on the relationship between RFT-II and Sec1. It is difficult to know the exact correspondence of recently cloned fragment of rat or porcine α1,2-fucosyltransferases (23Piau J.-P. Labarriere N. Dabouis G. Denis M.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Thurin J. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26577-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to RFT-I, −II, or −III, because all α1,2-fucosyltransferases, including the human and rabbit H type and Se types, exhibit high homology.It is interesting to consider that RFT-II represents a weak Se-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase. The weak Se-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase was postulated based on the results of Lewis phenotype analysis in Polynesian people. The Lewis antigens on erythrocytes are regulated by two fucosyltransferases, Se-type α1,2- and Lewis α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases. With the conventional analysis method, three Lewis phenotypes of erythrocytes were found in Caucasian adults, Le(a−b−), Le(a+b−), and Le(a−b+). When Se-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase is active (or in Secretor), most of the type 1 precursor is converted into type 1 H, which can be transformed into Leb by Lewis α1,3/4-fucosyltransferase. On the other hand, a fourth Lewis phenotype, Le(a+b+), was found on erythrocytes from selected Polynesian individuals. In addition, low levels of salivary ABH antigens, that is partial secretion, were found in saliva from Le(a+b−) and Le(a+b+) individuals, suggesting the presence of a weak Se-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase (11Henry S.M. Benny A.G. Woodfield D.G. Vox Sang. 1990; 58: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Henry S.M. Oriol R. Samuelsson B.E. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Molecular analysis of the Se and Sec1 genes of Polynesian people, especially of partial Secretor individuals, will facilitate determination of whether or not RFT-II corresponds to the human Sec1 gene.The fucosyltransferase assay showed that the relative activity of RFT-III toward GM1 as to glycoproteins was higher than that of RFT-I. RFT-III could also synthesize fucosyl GM1 from GM1 but not UEA-1 reactive antigens when expressed in Neuro2a cells, where RFT-I could form both and RFT-II could synthesize neither under the same transfection conditions. RFT-III is a good candidate for the enzyme that synthesizes fucosyl GM1 expressed in a subpopulation of neurons of rabbit embryonic DRG (16Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Kanazawa I. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Kusunoki S. Chiba A. Shimizu T. Kanazawa I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although we could not detect the expression of RFT-III in embryonic brain. It is possible that the expression of RFT-III is restricted to specific regions or specific types of neurons. In situ hybridization analysis will provide further information.Recently, aberrant α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity that synthesized Leb from Lea or Ley from the Lex determinant, or both, was found in cancer cells or tissues (13Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Sarnesto A. Thurin Y. Hindsgaul O. Koprowski H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Yazawa S. Nakamura J. Asao T. Nagamachi Y. Sagi M. Matta K.L. Tachikawa T. Akamatsu M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The classical models assume that Leb and Ley determinants are synthesized through the sequential actions of α1,2- and α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases through H determinants. In this case, α1,2-fucosyltransferase is not postulated to catalyze the fucosylation of Lea or Lex determinants. Accordingly, the α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity that formed Leb from Lea or Ley from the Lex determinant, or both, was supposed to represent an aberrant or new enzyme. In this study, however, we demonstrated that enzyme preparations from COS-7 cells transfected with rabbit α1,2-fucosyltransferases contained activity that fucosylated Lea or Lex or both determinants. Cancer cells or tissues of gastrointestinal origin might, we think, express an unusually large amount of H or Se α1,2-fucosyltransferase but not express an unusual α1,2-fucosyltransferase.Bombay individuals who lack active H and Se genes but who show no apparent abnormal phenotype cast doubt on the physiological role of α1,2-fucosylation of glycoconjugates. However, it remains possible that another α1,2-fucosyltransferase may operate at specific developmental stages or in restricted tissues or regions. This possibility was increased by the present study, in which we showed that at least in one mammalian species three active α1,2-fucosyltransferases exist.

In humans, genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that two distinct but closely linked structural genes (H and Se) code α1,2-fucosyltransferases with tissue-specific patterns (1Beyer T.A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5373-5379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Le Pendu J. Lemieux R.U. Lambert F. Dalix A.-M. Oriol R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1982; 34: 402-415PubMed Google Scholar). The human H gene controls the expression of H (Fucα1,2Galβ) antigens (along with A or B antigens or both) on erythrocytes, whereas the Se gene determines the soluble A, B, and H antigens in secretory glands, and Lewisb blood group antigens on red cells (for review, see 7Watkins W.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1980; 10: 1-136PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygosity for null alleles for the H and Se genes yields the rare Bombay blood type and non-Secretor phenotype, respectively. Recent molecular cloning of the H and Se genes provided the molecular basis for the Bombay and para-Bombay blood types and the non-Secretor phenotype, respectively, revealing point mutations within the coding regions that abolish the α1,2-fucosyltransferase activity (8Larsen R.D.

Budding yeast PCNA and the β-subunit of E. coli DNA pol III holoenzyme are structurally similar, one exception being that the β-subunit is composed of three globular domains forming a dimeric closed ring, whereas PCNA is composed of only two domains, thus forming a trimeric six-domain ring with a central cavity large enough to encircle DNA (24Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 25Krishna T.S.R. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Structural data have suggested that PCNA forms a homotrimer torus that encircles DNA and interacts with DNA polymerase δ, tethering it for processive DNA synthesis. These structural data also suggest that the protein loops between the six domains are important for interacting with other proteins for various DNA metabolic processes (24Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 25Krishna T.S.R. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). There is substantial conservation in the primary sequences of PCNA proteins from human, mouse, rice, Drosophila, and budding and fission yeast (reviewed in 26Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Double alanine scan mutagenesis of charged amino acid residues and random mutagenesis of budding yeast PCNA (POL30) have yielded varying degrees of growth defects and DNA damage sensitivity in vivo and defects in protein folding and protein-protein interactions in vitro. The pol30 mutant phenotypes have indicated distinct roles of budding yeast PCNA in DNA replication and repair (27Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, structure-function analysis of human PCNA has recently been described. Several amino acids were identified to be involved in stimulation of replication factor C (RF-C) ATPase activity or in enhancing the processivity of DNA synthesis by polymerase δ in vitro. Results of the human PCNA study suggest that some residues on the outer surface of PCNA function in protein-protein interactions (26Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To test if conservation of several residues in the protein loop regions of PCNA are essential for biological function, we isolated the gene and cDNA of fission yeast PCNA and overexpressed functionally active recombinant PCNA protein in bacteria. In this study, we analyzed nine site-directed mutations in seven conserved residues of fission yeast PCNA for their function in enhancing DNA polymerase δ processivity in vitro and their biological effects in vivo. Degenerate oligonucleotides were generated based on conserved sequence regions of PCNA from human, mouse, and budding yeast and used as polymerase chain reaction primers to amplify fission yeast genomic DNA. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were used to screen a genomic and cDNA library of S. pombe (28Wright A. Maundrell K. Heyer W.-D. Beach D. Nurse P. Plasmid. 1986; 15: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An EcoRI genomic fragment containing the entire gene of PCNA was isolated, and a full-length cDNA clone was obtained from multiple overlapping cDNA fragments. The full-length PCNA gene was cloned into pMT7H6p18 containing the M13 origin and named pMP1. This construct was used for generating site-directed mutants of S. pombe PCNA. A BamHI-SalI fragment containing either the wild type or mutant cDNAs as cassettes from site-directed mutagenesis reactions was constructed into pQE9, which contains a six-histidine tag (his6) at the amino terminus, and plasmids named pQE9/x. An expression vector pREP181 (LEU2, ars1+) was generated by modifying the multiple cloning site of pREP81 (30Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant PCNAs again as a BamHI-SalI cassette were constructed into the expression vector pREP181 for in vivo studies, and the resulting clones were named pREP181/x. Fission yeast media, cell growth, transformation, and standard genetic manipulations were as described (31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). Strains constructed and used in this study are listed in Table I. Diploid MAP112 containing a complete deletion of one copy of the PCNA coding sequence by replacement with the his3+ gene was constructed, verified by genomic Southern analysis, and used for in vivo studies. MAP112 was transformed with the expression plasmid pREP181 containing either wild type (pREP181/pcna+) or mutant PCNA (pREP181/mutantpcna) and sporulated in medium lacking leucine and histidine to select for leucine and histidine prototrophic haploids. Haploids containing the chromosomal Δpcna sustained by either pREP181/pcna+ or pREP181/mutantpcnas were analyzed. All cell growth was carried out at 30°C.Table IS. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceKG2h− ade6-M216 leu1-32 ura4-D18 his3-D1K. GouldKG3h+ ade6-M210 leu1-32 ura4-D18 his3-D1K.

Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. BamHI-SalI cassettes containing the mutations were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE9 and the yeast shuttle vector pREP181. Constructs containing wild type and mutant PCNAs were transformed into the E. coli M15[pREP4] (Nals,Strs,rifs,lac−,ara−,gal−,mtl−,F−,recA+,uvr+, [LacI]) for overexpression of protein. Cell cultures (500 ml) were grown in 2 × YT medium at either 30 or 37°C to A600 = 0.7-0.9. Cells were then induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and grown for 3 h at 30°C or 25°C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, and α2-macroglobulin), placed on ice for 10 min, and vortexed. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. Cell lysates were spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min. To the supernatants, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were added at 1 µl/ml of cell lysates and rotated end-over-end for 15 min at 4°C. The protein-bound Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were washed three times with high salt buffer (1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) followed by equilibration in a low salt buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then packed into a 10-ml column. The Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column was subsequently washed with 10 ml of low salt buffer. PCNA protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Fractions containing the protein eluate were pooled and dialyzed in successive volumes of either processivity buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) or fast protein liquid chromatography buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 25 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA). 200 µg of wild type or mutant PCNA proteins purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography from pQE9/PCNA+ or pQE9/x transformed M15 cell lysates was applied onto a Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel filtration column. Fractions of 500 µl were collected. Molecular mass markers used were: ferritin (multimer of 440 kDa), catalase (tetramer of 232 kDa), aldolase (tetramer of 161 kDa), transferrin (74 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (11 kDa). S. pombe PCNA protein overexpressed and purified as described above was partially denatured by incubating half of the sample at 95°C in 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. Both native and denatured proteins of PCNA were used as antigen to immunize a chicken for IgY production (33Gassmann M. Thommes P. Weiser T. Hubscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The polyclonal IgY specifically against S. pombe PCNA is named anti-FY-PCNA. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described in 34Park H. Francesconi S. Wang T.S.-F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. After transferring either the wild type or mutant recombinant PCNA proteins (0.5 µg) to Immobilon P membrane, they were blotted with anti-FY-PCNA in 1:100 dilution and detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-chicken IgG (Sigma). A reaction mixture (60 µl) containing 40 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.8, 2% glycerol, 40 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 6 mM MgCl2, 40 µM [α-32P]dTTP (320 cpm/pmol), 200 nM poly(dA)300-oligo(dT)16 (20:1 nucleotide ratio), 0.3 units of purified calf thymus polymerase δ (1Tan C.K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PCNA wild type or mutant protein as indicated were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated with 1 ml of 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 5 mg/ml carrier DNA. Acid-insoluble radioactive DNA products were quantitated (35Wang T.S.-F. Hu S.-Z. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1854-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The processivity of calf thymus polymerase δ in the presence of calf thymus PCNA and wild type or mutant S. pombe PCNA was measured on poly(dA)300-oligo(dT)16 using the DNA trap method (36Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Dong Q. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (a): 24163-24174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (10 µl) contained 100 nM primer-template, 0.5 units of purified calf thymus DNA polymerase δ, and 0.2 µg of either wild type or mutant PCNA. Reactions were commenced by incubation with dTTP for 1 min at room temperature, and DNA trap was subsequently added. Included as controls for each set of incubations were reactions with no dTTP substrate added, reactions with dTTP substrate but no DNA trap added, and reactions with dTTP substrate and DNA trap added simultaneously. The processivity is measured as the mean number of residues added by a DNA polymerase δ to a primer terminus per cycle of nucleotide addition as described in 36Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A.

Chem. 1993; 268 (a): 24163-24174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The assay for RF-C ATPase was as described (38Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22689-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modification. The reaction mixture (30 µl) contained 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl, 100 ng of single primed M13 mp18 DNA, 850 ng of E. coli SSB, 100 µM [α-32P]ATP, and PCNA as indicated. Reactions were started by addition of 25 ng of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RF-C and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 10 µl of 50 mM EDTA and 1% SDS. Products were analyzed by POLYGRAM cel 300 polyethyleneimine thin-layer chromatography in 0.5 M LiCl/1 M formic acid. Conversion of ATP to ADP was quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were ethanol fixed and stained with DAPI for microscopic analysis as described (39Sazer S. Sherwood S.W. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Park H. Davis R.E. Wang T.S.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4337-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). UV sensitivity analysis was performed by plating a known density of mid log phase cells onto appropriate agar plates and exposing cells to UV irradiation at different doses. Cells were then incubated at 30°C for 3–4 days. Colonies were counted, and survival was expressed as a percentage of colonies formed on irradiated versus nonirradiated plates. A known UV sensitive strain, rad26, was included as a positive control. Nine site-directed mutations were introduced into 7 conserved residues, Leu2, Asp63, Arg64, Gly69, Gln201, Glu259, and Glu260 of S. pombe PCNA. The location of these seven residues in the PCNA structure are depicted in Fig. 1. Leu2 is located at the amino terminus and is conserved among PCNA proteins of fission and budding yeast and rice. In mammalian cells and Drosophila, a hydrophobic residue, Phe, instead of Leu is located at this position. Asp63 and Arg64 are located in the protein loop between β-sheets βE1 and βF1 of budding yeast PCNA (25Krishna T.S.R. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Asp63 and Arg64 are conserved among PCNAs of mammalian cells, rice, Drosophila, and fission yeast, whereas budding yeast has a polar residue, His, in place of the charged residue, Arg. Gly69 is not located in a protein loop region but is in β-sheet βF1. Gly69 is highly conserved among PCNAs of all species. Mutation of this residue in budding yeast PCNA to Asp has been shown to suppress cold-sensitive alleles of CDC44, which encodes the large subunit of budding yeast replication factor C (41McAlear M.A. Howell E.A. Espenshade K.K. Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4390-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, Gly69 of S. pombe PCNA was selected for similar mutation to Asp to test the mutational effect. Gln201 is conserved only between budding and fission yeast. PCNA from most other species has the similar size residue Glu instead of Gln at this position. Gln201 is located in the second domain of the protein loop between βE2 and βF2. Glu259 and Glu260 are located at the carboxyl terminus. Leu2 was conservatively changed to Val, and Gly69 was changed to Asp like that in budding yeast (41McAlear M.A. Howell E.A. Espenshade K.K. Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4390-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas Asp63, Arg64, Gln201, Glu259, and Glu260 were all mutated to Ala to abolish both the length and charge of the side chains in order to test their function. A double mutation of the two adjacent charged residues Glu259 and Glu260 was generated to test the combinational charge effect of these two carboxyl terminus residues. The three-dimensional structure of budding yeast PCNA indicates that residues Leu2, Asp63, and Arg64 are located in one region of the PCNA homotrimer. The side chains of Leu2 and Arg64 are orientated toward the outer rim of one face of the PCNA molecule, whereas the side chain of Asp63 is orientated in a different direction (Fig. 1). Thus, a double mutant L2V/R64A was also generated to test the combinational effect of mutation of both Leu2 and Arg64. Wild type and mutant PCNA proteins were expressed in E. coli and affinity purified to near homogeneity. Although the cDNA of S. pombe PCNA has a predicted molecular mass of 29 kDa, the recombinant PCNA resolves as a 36-kDa protein in SDS gel analysis. The purified proteins were further verified by immunoblotting with antibodies against S. pombe PCNA (Fig. 2). To test if the wild type or mutant PCNA proteins had any significant physical alterations, these were analyzed by gel filtration for trimer formation. The recombinant wild type PCNA protein and all of the PCNA mutant proteins eluted mainly as trimers with a molecular mass of 90 kDa with minor quantities of the protein as monomer with a molecular mass of 29 kDa (Fig. 3, upper panel). SDS gel analysis of gel filtration fractions of the wild type and mutant PCNA proteins L2V, D63A, R64A, L2V/R64A, Q201A, E259A, E260A, and E259A/E260A showed the majority of protein in homotrimer form with the peak fraction of the protein eluting between fractions 27 and 29 (Fig. 3, lower panel, and data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the mutations introduced into these invariant residues either as single or as double mutants have no significant effect on homotrimer formation of the PCNA protein. Furthermore, all these eight PCNA proteins were expressed with a his-tag at the amino terminus. The ability of these PCNA proteins to form the homotrimer ring in solution strongly suggests that the amino-terminal his-tag does not affect the homotrimer ring formation (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Wild type PCNA and mutant L2V, R64A, and L2V/R64A proteins are able to form homotrimers. Upper panel, gel filtration profile of S. pombe PCNA proteins. 200 µg of purified recombinant wild type or mutant PCNA protein were analyzed on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel filtration column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two arrows mark the expected gel filtration position of PCNA trimer (approximately 90 kDa) and PCNA monomer (29 kDa). Molecular mass standards used are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lower panel, SDS gel analysis of gel filtration fractions. Gel filtration fractions 21–32 of wild type and mutant PCNA proteins were analyzed on a SDS gel and stained with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of heterospecies PCNA to stimulate calf thymus DNA polymerase δ in vitro has been previously demonstrated (42Bauer G.A.

Using poly(dA)-oligo(dT) as primer template, in vitro DNA synthetic activity of the highly purified two-subunit calf thymus DNA polymerase δ holoenzyme was analyzed either in the absence of PCNA, with calf thymus PCNA, or with wild type S. pombe PCNA. Wild type S. pombe PCNA was able to stimulate calf thymus DNA polymerase δ similar to calf thymus PCNA (Fig. 4A). Mutants D63A, Q201A, E259A, and E260A and the double mutant E259A/E260A were all able to stimulate DNA synthesis by polymerase δ at levels similar to that of wild type S. pombe PCNA (Table II). In contrast, mutants L2V and R64A showed approximately 50% of the wild type PCNA's ability to stimulate DNA polymerizing activity of polymerase δ. The double mutant, L2V/R64A, had synergistic effects resulting in less than 10% of the wild type PCNA's ability in stimulating DNA polymerizing activity of polymerase δ (Fig. 4B and Table II). The deficiency of mutant PCNAs L2V, R64A, and L2V/R64A to stimulate DNA polymerase δ is specific to Leu2 and Arg64 in this particular region of PCNA because mutant D63A, despite being a highly conserved residue adjacent to Arg64 and located in the same protein loop, had wild type PCNA capacity in stimulating DNA polymerase δ activity (Table II). These results suggest that the side chains of Leu2 and Arg64 but not the side chain of Asp63 are specific in stimulating the DNA synthetic activity of DNA polymerase δ. Lastly, mutant G69D was unable to stimulate DNA synthetic activity of polymerase δ beyond that of the holoenzyme alone. The abilities of each PCNA mutant to stimulate polymerase δ DNA synthetic activity are summarized in Table II.Table IISummary of PCNA mutant effects on DNA polymerase δ holoenzyme synthetic activity in vitroMutantDNA polδ Activity%L2V46D63A90 −100R64A46G69D0.3Q201A90 −100E259A90 −100E260A90 −100L2V/R64A8 −10E259A/E260A90 −100 Open table in a new tab The processivity of DNA polymerase δ was measured to test whether the deficiency of PCNA mutants L2V, R64A, and L2V/R64A to stimulate polymerase δ DNA synthesis activity was due to their inability to enhance DNA polymerase δ processivity. Using poly(dA)300-oligo(dT)16 as primer template, polymerase δ processivity was analyzed by a DNA trap method either in the absence of PCNA or in the presence of calf thymus PCNA, wild type S. pombe PCNA, or S. pombe mutant PCNAs L2V, R64A, L2V/R64A, and D63A (Fig. 5). In the absence of added PCNA, DNA polymerase δ incorporated merely 3 nucleotides per binding of the primer terminus. In the presence of calf thymus PCNA, polymerase δ was able to incorporate >30 nucleotides per binding event of the primer terminus. With wild type S. pombe PCNA, DNA polymerase δ showed a processivity of >20 nucleotides. In contrast, with mutant L2V, polymerase δ showed a greater than 50% reduction of its processivity as compared with the wild type PCNA with only 9 nucleotides incorporated per primer binding event. With mutant R64A, DNA polymerase δ had a 25% reduction in its processivity incorporating, 15 nucleotides per primer binding event. With the double mutant, L2V/R64A, DNA polymerase δ showed a processivity of 5 nucleotides incorporated per pr"

While HBx has been shown to increase gene expression in trans, it is generally believed that it does not bind double-stranded DNA. Using several experimental approaches, we show that HBx interacts with single-stranded DNA in a manner that is not sequence-specific. Various heterologous single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides were able to compete in HBx-ssDNA interactions in gel shift assays.

https://openalex.org/W2051723208,"Type II iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase is an ∼200-kDa multimeric enzyme in the brain that catalyzes the deiodination of thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) to its active metabolite, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine. In astrocytes, cAMP stimulation is required to express catalytically active type II iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase. The affinity ligand <i>N</i>-bromoacetyl-L-T<sub>4</sub> specifically labels the 29-kDa substrate-binding subunit (p29) of this enzyme in cAMP-stimulated astrocytes. To determine the requirements for cAMP-induced activation of this enzyme, we optimized <i>N</i>-bromoacetyl-L-T<sub>4</sub> labeling of p29 in astrocytes lacking type II iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase activity and examined the effects of cAMP on the hydrodynamic properties and subcellular location of the enzyme. We show that the p29 subunit is expressed in unstimulated astrocytes and requires 10-fold higher concentrations of <i>N</i>-bromoacetyl-L-T<sub>4</sub> to achieve incorporation levels equal to those of p29 in cAMP-stimulated cells. Gel filtration showed that p29 was part of a multimeric membrane-associated complex in both cAMP-stimulated and unstimulated astrocytes and that cAMP stimulation led to an increase of ∼60 kDa in the mass of the holoenzyme. In unstimulated astrocytes, p29 resides in the perinuclear space. Cyclic AMP stimulation leads to the translocation of p29 to the plasma membrane coincident with the appearance of deiodinating activity. These data show that cAMP-dependent activation of type II iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase activity results from the synthesis of additional activating factor(s) that associates with inactive enzyme and leads to the translocation of enzyme polypeptide(s) from the perinuclear space to the plasma membrane."

The mutagenized cassettes were used to replace the wild-type region in the full-length cDNA, and pools of mutants were transfected into HeLa cells. After the generation of resistant cells via selection in 0.5 µM ouabain, polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the mutagenized cassette from the genomic DNA of the stable transfectants. Sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction product revealed three amino acid substitutions: I729V, L793P, and K836R. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that only L793P was important for resistance. To elucidate the role of L793 in ouabain inhibition, additional mutations at this position were prepared. L793A and L793I mutants were constructed and expressed in HeLa cells. Only L793A survived selection using ouabain, which suggested that resistance is not due to the specific substitution of leucine with proline. To explore the mechanism of resistance, apparent affinities of the L793P mutant for sodium and potassium were compared to the wild-type HeLa pump. Although the apparent affinities were comparable for sodium, the mutant had a 2-fold higher apparent affinity for potassium. This suggests that the mechanism of ouabain insensitivity of L793P is due to a perturbation in the region of the enzyme that may include the K+ binding site.

INTRODUCTIONThe transit between the different endocytotic and exocytotic membrane compartments in the eucaryotic cell is mediated by carrier vesicles that bud from a donor compartment and fuse with the proximal acceptor membrane. Transport is regulated by an array of distinct proteins, which are conserved from man to yeast (for review see 1Rothman J.E.

Genetic and biochemical analyses have led to the discovery of two Ras-like GTP-binding proteins, SEC4 and YPT1, which are necessary for protein export in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Salminen A.

These so-called Rab proteins form an independent subfamily of the Ras-like GTPases, which can replace the corresponding YPT function in yeast (8Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Rab15 is also restricted to brain-specific tissue, and Rab17 is found only in polarized epithelial cells (17Elferink L.A. Anzai K. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Studies using different in vitro transport assays have shown the important role of Rab1b in ER to Golgi and cis to medial Golgi transport (11Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pin S. Khosravi-Far R. Bourne J.R.

Riedler M.A. Goda Y. Zerial M. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The Rab6 protein is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian cells and is found also in plants and yeast (14Goud B. Zahraoui A. Touchot N. Saraste J. Nature. 1990; 345: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 21Bednarek S.Y. Reynolds T.L. Schroeder M. Grabowski R. Hengst L. Gallwitz D. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 104: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In a previous study we have used the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor to prove that cis to medial Golgi transport needs the function of Rab proteins (22Elazar Z. Mayer T. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 794-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Goud and co-workers proposed that the transit of proteins through the Golgi depends on Rab6 protein (23Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salmareo J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To study the function of Rab6, we have generated specific antibodies against the hypervariable region of Rab6 protein. These antibodies were used to study the function of Rab6 in the well established cis to medial in vitro Golgi transport system. We report here that Rab6 is: 1) an essential factor for the vesicular transport between two Golgi cisternae and 2) involved in a step related to membrane fusion. The data presented here define for the first time a Rab6-dependent step on a molecular level.RESULTSTo study the function of Rab6 in the regulation of intercisternal transport between cis and medial parts of the Golgi apparatus, we raised inhibitory antibodies against the Rab6 protein. To ensure the antibody specificity for Rab6, two different antibodies were prepared, one against the native Rab6 protein and the other against a chemically synthesized C-terminal peptide fragment of Rab6. The synthetic peptide corresponds to amino acids 176–206 of the C-terminal coding region of Rab6. This region is called the hypervariable region and represents the most diverse part among the members of the Rab family (8Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8210-8214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). IgG fractions and affinity-purified antibodies were prepared from individual bleeds of the rabbits.Western blots were used to establish the specificity of the resulting antibodies. In total CHO or bovine brain cytosol and in Golgi membrane preparations, a single band of 26 kDa comigrating with the native Rab6 band was detected. No cross-reaction with other bands in the 20–30 kDa range could be detected. Using bacterially expressed Rab6 protein, the detection limit was 1–2 ng with an antibody concentration of 4 µg/ml. In ELISA neither of the two affinity-purified antibodies showed any cross-reactivity with Rab1b, the second member of the Rab family found in the Golgi apparatus.Rab6 Antibodies Inhibit Transport Between cis and medial CisternaeAffinity-purified peptide- or protein-specific antibodies were added to in vitro Golgi transport reactions, and the effects of the two different antibodies were studied. Both types of antibodies affected intra-Golgi transport. Comparison of different antibody preparations revealed that the preparations with the highest inhibitory potency could be generated by affinity-purifying antibodies raised against total Rab6 recombinant protein with the synthetic Rab6 peptide. In Fig. 1A the effect of these C-terminal specific antibodies on an in vitro transport assay is shown. Increasing amounts of antibody inhibit the assay. Maximum inhibition was achieved with 10 µg of antibody in a 50-µl assay. The half-maximal inhibition was observed at antibody concentrations of 40 µg of IgG/ml. Preincubation of the transport reaction for 1 h on ice before shifting the reaction to 37°C enhanced the inhibitory effect of the antibodies. To exclude interference of the anti-Rab6 antibodies with the antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation that quantifies the in vitro transport, anti-Rab6 antibodies were added at different points in time after the start of the transport reaction. Transport inhibition by the anti-Rab6 antibodies decreased when they were added after starting the transport reaction. Inhibition was negligible when the anti-Rab6 antibodies were added 40 min after starting the transport reaction (data not shown).Addition of rabbit IgG (Sigma) to the transport reaction also did not result in an inhibition of transport, thus excluding inhibition by IgG molecules. Further control experiments were performed with affinity-purified antibodies against ARF1. ARF1 is a related Golgi-associated small GTP-binding protein that is found in much higher concentrations in the cytosol than Rab6. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, no inhibition of the transport assay occurs, proving that antibodies to Golgi localized antigens have no inhibitory effect per se.After blocking of the Rab6 inhibitory antibodies by preincubation with the Rab6 peptide, an increase of transport was observed. A total recovery of transport activity by preincubation with the Rab6 peptide could not be achieved. This can be explained by two facts. 1) The amount of peptide that could be added to the transport reaction was limited, since the peptide itself showed an inhibitory effect on the transport. This inhibition may be to due to an interference of the peptide with the interaction of Rab6 and Rab6 accessory factors. 2) The Rab6 antibodies were prepared from antisera raised against Rab6 protein and subsequently purified using the Rab6 peptide as an affinity matrix. It is a known fact that antibodies have a much higher avidity to the corresponding native protein than to an artificial peptide. In the assay the peptide prebound to the antibody can so be exchanged against the endogenous Rab6 protein, resulting in a new inhibition of transport activity. The specificity of the peptide block is shown by the fact that preincubation of the Rab6 antibodies with a C-terminal Rab1 peptide did not result in a rescue of transport (Fig. 1B).To exclude cross-linking of the Golgi membranes by bivalent IgGs as the underlying event of the anti-Rab6 transport inhibition, monovalent Fab fragments were prepared from Rab6-specific sera. In Fig. 1C the inhibitory effect of Rab6-specific Fab fragments is demonstrated. The Fab fragments are not as potent as the intact IgGs, which could be due to partial denaturation of the molecules during the papain treatment. Control reactions in the presence of Fab fractions prepared from unspecific rabbit IgG (Sigma) showed no effect on the transport process. Thus a contaminating papain activity in the Fab preparation as an explanation for the inhibition was excluded.A Transdominant Mutant of the Rab6 Protein Interferes with Intercisternal Golgi TransportTo gain further proof of the essential function of the Rab6 gene product in intra-Golgi transport, interferant mutations were generated. Previous mutation analyses of Ras and Ras-related proteins have shown that certain mutations in the GTP-binding domains of small GTP-binding proteins result in a so-called trans dominant effect. Trans dominant mutations neutralize the function of the wild type gene product in trans (28Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar).Based on the knowledge of the structure-function relationship in the Ras superfamily, three different point mutations were introduced into the GTP-binding sites of the Rab6 protein. Table I summarizes the constructed mutations in the Rab6 gene. The hydroxy amino acid Thr-27 was changed to Asn. The corresponding mutation in the Ras protein results in a mutant that prefers to bind GDP instead of GTP (29Feig L. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 8: 3225-3243Google Scholar). The replacement of Gln-72 by Arg in the Rab6 protein leads to a mutant that shows a drastically reduced GTPase activity (28Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar). The change of Asn-126 to Ile results in an inability to bind any nucleotide in the Ras protein and in the closely related YPT1 and Rab gene products (20Grovel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 28Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar).The mutations were introduced into the Rab6 cDNA, and the mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli using the pQE9 vector system, which provides a His tag to facilitate purification by nickel-agarose chromatography. The structure of the Rab6 expression vector is shown schematically in Table I.Fig. 2A shows the effect of Rab6 wt, Rab6 Q72R, and Rab6 T27N proteins on cis and medial Golgi transport. No significant effect could be obtained; neither the wild type nor the T27N or Q72R mutation showed any interference with the transport reaction in concentrations up to 3 µg/50-µl assay. In contrast, the N126I mutation inhibited transport by more than 60% with a half-maximal concentration of about 60 ng in a 50-µl transport reaction (Fig. 2B). An inhibitory effect resulting from E. coli proteins copurifying with the Rab6 N126I could be excluded, since neither the Rab6 wt nor the T27N or the Q72R proteins, purified with the same protocol, showed an inhibitory effect. Wild type and mutant proteins were isolated from E. coli, so they lacked the C-terminal geranylgeranyl modification. This lipid modification is necessary for membrane binding of Rab proteins (20Grovel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 30Walworth N.C. Goud B. Kastan Kabcenell A. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 31Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. Stelzer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Membrane binding studies using isolated rabbit liver Golgi membranes showed that Rab6 protein purified from overexpressing E. coli cells binds only very poorly (data not shown). It can therefore be concluded that the Rab6 N126I mutation inhibits transport as a soluble agent. Whether the T27N and Q72R mutants have no effect on transport at all or may have an effect in a membrane-bound form awaits further investigations.Fig. 2Effect of Rab6 wt, Rab6 T27N, and Rab6 Q72R on transport between cis and medial Golgi cisternae. In vitro Golgi transport reactions were performed in the presence of increasing amounts of purified Rab6 wt or mutant proteins. Recombinant proteins were added in 50 mM imidazole, pH 7.0. After 1 h at 37°C, the amount of transported VSV-G protein was determined. A, purified Rab6 wt, T27N, or Q72R was added to the transport reaction. B, purified Rab6 N126I was added to the transport reaction. Note the different amounts of Rab protein added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rab6 Is Involved in a Process Close to Membrane FusionThe experiments shown above clearly illustrate the essential function of Rab6 in Golgi transport. Vesicle formation on Golgi membranes requires ARF and the soluble coatomer complex (32Orci L. Palmer D.J. Ravazzola M. Perrelet A. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 33Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Membrane binding studies using inhibitory Rab6 antibodies showed that the Rab6 antibodies had at most a slight effect on the binding of the coatomer complex to the membranes, as judged by the amount of βCOP bound to the membranes in the presence of GTPγS. These data make Rab6 participation in the formation of coated vesicles highly unlikely. The fact that we could not detect the Rab6 protein on Golgi-derived coated vesicles with Western blot analysis (data non shown) is an additional hint that Rab6 is functional in vesicle consumption rather than formation. Since Rab6 seems to be absent from coated vesicle membranes, it is unlikely that Rab6 functions as a factor that facilitates targeting or docking of Golgi-derived vesicles to their acceptor compartments.It has been postulated previously that Rab proteins mediate the fusion of vesicles with intracellular membranes. To gain further proof of this hypothesis, we used brefeldin A-treated or salt-washed transport assays. These assays are permutations of the in vitro Golgi transport assays (27Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 34Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Addition of the fungal metabolite brefeldin A to cultured mammalian cells results in fusion of Golgi membranes with membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Similar effects are observed on isolated membranes only (34Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Movement and glycosylation of the VSV-G protein in a brefeldin A-treated cis to medial Golgi transport assay are mediated by uncoupled fusion between the Golgi cisternae rather than by vesicle formation and vesicle fusion (35Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, brefeldin A uncouples fusion from vesicle formation by removing the coat from the Golgi membranes. Brefeldin A itself has little effect on the glycosylation of the VSV G marker protein. This can be explained by the fact that in the standard in vitro transport assay most of the G protein is transported and glycosylated by vesicular transport. The same is true for the brefeldin A-treated assay, but now glycosylation is achieved by colocalization of the G protein and the glycosyltransferase through uncoupled fusion induced by the cellular fusion machinery. Since under both conditions most of the G protein is glycosylated, only a minor difference in the total amount of glycosylation could be observed. Pretreatment of standard transport reactions with 200 µM brefeldin A made the transport resistant to GTPγS. This shows that brefeldin A-treated transport assays measure membrane fusion rather than vesicular transport, since GTPγS blocks uncoating of transport vesicles by arresting ARF on the coated vesicle membrane (34Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 35Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3A the effect of anti-Rab6 antibodies on brefeldin A transport assays is shown. Preincubation of transport assays with both 10 µg of anti-Rab6 antibodies and brefeldin A resulted in an inhibition of glycosylation similar to that observed in transport assays pretreated with anti-Rab6 antibodies only (Fig. 1).Fig. 3Anti-Rab6 antibodies inhibit fusion. In vitro Golgi transport assays were performed in the presence of 200 µM brefeldin A or with salt-washed membranes. After 1 h at 37°C, the amount of transported VSV G-protein was determined. A, 50-µl standard transport reactions were preincubated in the presence (rab6 Ab) or the absence of anti-Rab6 antibodies for 1 h on ice. Where indicated, brefeldin A (BFA) was added to 200 µM. Addition of 10 µM GTPγS is also indicated. B, transport assays were performed using standard membranes (untreated) or membranes washed with 1 M KCl (salt-washed). Assays were performed for 1 h at 30°C. Where indicated 10 µg of anti-Rab6 antibodies were added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An additional proof for a function of Rab6 in fusion came from the use of salt-washed assays. Treatment of donor and acceptor membranes with 1 M KCl results in the loss of peripheral membrane proteins, which makes the membranes competent for fusion with each other (27Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Fusion in brefeldin A and salt-treated transport depends on the cytosolic fusion proteins NSF and SNAPs (27Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 34Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows the effect of anti-Rab6 antibodies on the standard and salt-washed fusion assays. 10 µg of Rab6-specific antibodies inhibit the transport assay by more than 50%. These data are similar to those obtained from the standard transport assay (Fig. 1A). Thus, there is strong evidence for a role of Rab6 in fusion of vesicle membranes with their acceptor compartments.DISCUSSIONAt present, three different subclasses of GTP-binding proteins involved in intra-Golgi transport have been characterized.

(23Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salmareo J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate that overexpression of Rab6 or the Rab6 Q72L mutant reduced the transport of different proteins through the Golgi apparatus.In the investigations presented here, we used a cell-free system and pursued two different approaches to analyze possible functions of Rab6 in more detail.1) Inhibitory antibodies specific for the hypervariable region of Rab6 were found to block transport between cis and medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. Inhibitory antibodies have already been used as a tool to study Rab function in various cell-free systems (11Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pin S. Khosravi-Far R. Bourne J.R. Schwanninger R. Der C.J. Balch W.E.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 239-252Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 1 show the anti-Rab6 antibody effect to be specific for Rab6 inhibition.2) The effects of different mutations in the GTP binding regions of Rab6 on cis to medial Golgi transport were analyzed (Table I). One mutant, Rab6 N126I, showed a transdominant interferant effect on intra-Golgi transport (Fig. 2B), thus providing further evidence for the essential function of Rab6 in intra-Golgi transport. The analogous mutations in SEC4 (30Walworth N.C. Goud B. Kastan Kabcenell A. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and Rab5 (20Grovel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), with a substitution of Ile for Asn in the conserved NKXD motif, also resulted in a loss of GTP binding activity and a neutralization of the corresponding wild type protein.Since the Rab6 N126I mutant was purified from E. coli, the resulting protein lacked the C-terminal geranylgeranyl modification. Under the conditions used in our assay system, an efficient modification of the Rab6 proteins seems unlikely, since low molecular weight components were removed from the cytosol by gel filtration. The corresponding Rab1 N124I mutant had a similar effect on vesicle transport. Pind et al. showed that an non-isoprenylated form of this mutant inhibits the fusion of ER-derived vesicles with Golgi membranes (38Pind S.N. Nuoffer C. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Farquahar M.G. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 239-252Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). While for Rab1 and Rab6, isoprenylation of the N126I mutant seems optional, Stahl and co-workers demonstrated that for an analogous mutant protein of Rab5, Rab5 N133I, this lipid modification is needed for the trans dominant inhibitory effect (39Li G. Barbieri A. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that the Rab6 N126I mutant did not affect exocytosis after expression in HeLa cells (40Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This can be explained by the fact that the resulting protein product might be unstable after transfection into HeLa cells.Recombinant Rab6 wt, Rab6 T27N, and Rab6 Q72R had no effect in our assay system. However, overexpression of Rab6 wt and Rab6 T27N in mammalian cells resulted in a slowdown of protein transfer in the Golgi complex (23Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salmareo J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this lack of inhibition might be that the mutants can only show an effect after modification and subsequently binding to the cisternal membranes. Recen"

Electron density for the guanine-5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate complex is consistent with a mixture of the triphosphate nucleoside and its hydrolyzed diphosphate nucleoside bound to the active site. The base, ribose, and α-phosphate positions overlap, but the β-phosphates occupy different binding sites. The binding of guanosine-5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate to the active site is comparable with that of guanosine-5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. No electron density, however, for the corresponding diphosphate nucleoside is observed. In addition, electron density for bound Mg2+ is absent in these nucleotide complexes. The guanine nucleotide complexes of the synthetase are compared with complexes of other GTP-binding proteins and to a preliminary structure of the complex of GDP, IMP, Mg2+, and succinate with the synthetase. The enzyme, under conditions reported here, does not undergo a conformational change in response to the binding of guanine nucleotides, and minimally IMP and/or Mg2+ must be present in order to facilitate the complete recognition of the guanine nucleotide by the synthetase.

https://openalex.org/W1538781971,"The interaction of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nucleocapsid protein (NCp) with a substrate closely mimicking a retrovirus replication intermediate was studied. The heteroduplex substrate consisted of a DNA and RNA of 80 and 63 nucleotides, respectively. The nucleotides at the 3' end of the DNA were complementary to those at the 3' end of the RNA such that a hybrid region of 30 base pairs could form. HIV-reverse transcriptase (RT) extended the DNA and cleaved the RNA strand of the substrate. The rates of extension and cleavage were significantly decreased when the substrate was prebound with NCp before HIV-RT addition. In assays assessing the integrity of the substrate by measuring release of the DNA strand from the heteroduplex, prebinding with NCp protected the substrate when HIV-RT was added, a result consistent with resistance to RT-mediated cleavage. In contrast, NCp significantly decreased the thermal stability of the substrate as judged by incubation of the substrate at various temperatures. In strand transfer assays, a 189-nucleotide RNA (acceptor) with an internal region complementary to all 80 nucleotides of the substrate DNA was incubated with the substrate in the presence or absence of NCp. Nucleocapsid protein stimulated strand transfer in which the substrate RNA was displaced upon binding of the DNA to the acceptor. Results are discussed with respect to the role of NCp in retroviral recombination."
