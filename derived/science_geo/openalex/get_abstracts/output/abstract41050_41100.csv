https://openalex.org/W1541248931,"The complete nucleotide sequences of rat M1- and M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs were determined by sequencing the cDNAs and by analyses of S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension. The sequences have an identical molecular size of about 2220 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail and include 1593-nucleotide coding region. Their nucleotide sequences are identical except for 160-nucleotide sequences within the coding regions. The amino acid sequences of the M1- and M2-type subunits deduced from the cDNA sequences differ by only 45 residues within domain C, which constitutes the main region responsible for intersubunit contact. The sequence of this region of the M2-type shows higher homology than that of the M1-type with the corresponding sequence of the L-type. Since the M2- and L-types are allosteric enzymes, unlike to the M1-type, the residues common to the M2- and L-types, but not the M1-type may be important for mediating the allosteric properties. Genomic clones encoding both M1- and M2-type isozyme mRNAs were isolated. By partial sequence analysis of a clone lambda MPK37 four exons were identified, of which two adjacent exons coded the M1- and M2-specific sequences, respectively. The two remaining exons present downstream coded amino acids common to the two isozymes. Thus, we conclude that the M1- and M2-type isozymes of pyruvate kinase are produced from the same gene probably by alternative RNA splicing."

A 9000-base pair cloned probe of HBLV detected specific sequences in DNA and RNA of infected cells but did not hybridize to the genomic DNA of other human herpesviruses including the Epstein-Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex type I, and varicella-zoster virus. Conversely, while probes obtained from each of the known human herpesvirus readily detected the homologous viral DNA, they did not hybridize to genomic HBLV DNA. This evidence, in addition to serological and morphological distinctions and the biological effects of this virus demonstrate that HBLV is a novel human herpesvirus."
https://openalex.org/W2102575752,The specificity of reactions catalyzed by the Tetrahymena pre-rRNA intervening sequence (IVS) was studied using site-specific mutagenesis. Two sequences required for 5' splice-site selection during self-splicing were defined. Single-base changes in either a 5' exon sequence or a 5' exon-binding site within the IVS disrupt their ability to pair and result in inefficient or inaccurate splicing. Combinations that restore complementarity suppress the effect of the single-base changes. Sequence alterations in the 5' exon-binding site also change the specificity of two other reactions: intermolecular exon ligation (trans-splicing) and the enzymatic nucleotidyltransferase activity of the IVS RNA. Thus the substrate specificity of an RNA enzyme can be changed in a manner predictable by the rules of Watson-Crick base-pairing.

https://openalex.org/W2076017593,"Carboxypeptidase E (enkephalin convertase) was first identified as the carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of enkephalin in bovine adrenal chromaffin granules. A similar enzyme is present in many brain regions and in purified secretory granules from rat pituitary and rat insulinoma. Within the secretory granules, carboxypeptidase E (CPE) activity is found in both a soluble and a membrane-bound form, which differ slightly in relative molecular mass (Mr). Here, to investigate whether the CPE activities in the various tissues are produced from a single gene, purified CPE was partially sequenced and oligonucleotide probes were used to isolate a clone encoding CPE from a bovine pituitary complementary DNA library. This cDNA hybridizes to bovine pituitary poly(A)+ RNAs of approximately 3.3, 2.6 and 2.1 kilobases (kb), with the 3.3-kb messenger RNA the predominant species. The predicted amino-acid sequence of the cDNA clone contains the partially determined sequences of CPE, several pairs of basic amino acids and displays some homology with both carboxypeptidases A and B. Restriction analysis of bovine genomic DNA suggests only one gene for CPE. This is consistent with a broad role for CPE in the biosynthesis of many neuropeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2007707744,"Neuroleukin is a lymphokine product of lectin-stimulated T cells that induces immunoglobulin secretion by cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Neuroleukin acts early in the in vitro response that leads to formation of antibody-secreting cells, but continued production of immunoglobulin by differentiated antibody-secreting cells is neuroleukin-independent. Although the factor is not directly mitogenic, cellular proliferation is a late component of the response to neuroleukin. Neuroleukin does not have B-cell growth factor (BCGF) or B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF) activity in defined assays. Neuroleukin-evoked induction of immunoglobulin secretion is both monocyte- and T-cell-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1510923466,"We have previously reported the isolation of a 35-kDa protein from A-431 cells that, in the presence of Ca2+, can serve as a substrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/tyrosine kinase (Fava, R.A., and Cohen, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2636-2645). We now report the detection of an antigenically related 35-kDa protein in a number, but not all, of rat, pig, and human tissues. These antigenically related proteins also can serve as substrates for the EGF receptor/kinase in the presence of Ca2+. All of these proteins share the property of reversible, Ca2+-dependent binding to the particulate fraction (presumably membranes) of cell homogenates. We have isolated the 35-kDa substrate from porcine lung and have demonstrated that it is a Ca2+-binding protein. The amino-terminal sequence and the site of tyrosine phosphorylation therein have been determined. The positions of the acidic amino acid residues amino-terminal to the tyrosine phosphorylation site bear a distinct resemblance to the sequence in the homologous region of a number of other substrates for tyrosine kinases. Based on available data, the 35-kDa protein clearly differs from the protein I complex derived from intestinal mucosa and thought to be related to the proteins isolated herein (Gerke, V., and Weber, K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1688-1695). Finally, we report a striking sequence homology between the porcine 35-kDa described herein and human lipocortin, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1512269360,"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to monitor proteins synthesized in unstimulated control and in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)- or cAMP-stimulated rat adrenal cells. Four proteins, which have similar proteolytic peptide maps, have been identified. The two found primarily in unstimulated cells are referred to as pb and pa, where pb is the protein with more basic isoelectric point. Similarly, proteins ib and ia were detected only in stimulated cells. The synthesis of pb occurs only in unstimulated cells and that of ib only in stimulated cells. Protein ib accumulates with the same lag time, rate, and stimulant dose response as the increase in steroid hormone synthesis. Pulse-chase studies showed that protein ib is not produced from pb by a post-translational modification. Proteins pb and ib thus seem identical with proteins p and i previously identified in rat adrenal cortex and corpus luteum (Krueger, R.J., and Orme-Johnson, N. R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10159-10167, and Pon, L.A., and Orme-Johnson, N.R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6594-6599). The acidic forms, pa and ia, appear after a longer lag time and are produced at a slower rate than the basic forms. Pulse-chase studies showed that the disappearance of the basic form of each protein occurs concurrently with the appearance of the corresponding acidic form. Addition of [32P]orthophosphate to stimulated adrenal cells allowed direct demonstration that proteins ib and ia are phosphorylated. Moreover, alkaline phosphatase treatment of [35S]methionine-labeled, cAMP-stimulated adrenal cells caused a large decrease in the amounts of ib and ia and the appearance of proteins with the same two-dimensional electrophoretic mobilities as pb and pa. These observations suggest that protein ib may mediate stimulation of steroidogenesis, be produced by an ACTH- or cAMP-dependent, cotranslational phosphorylation of protein pb, and be lost by a cycloheximide-insensitive, post-translational conversion to ia."
https://openalex.org/W1486424025,"The synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) have been studied in a human hepatoma cell line, the Hep G2 cells. The time needed for the synthesis of apoB-100 was estimated to be 14 min, which corresponds to a translation rate of approximately 6 amino acids/s. ApoB-100 was compared with albumin and alpha 2-macroglobulin as to the distribution between the membrane and the luminal content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. The results suggested that apoB-100 approximately followed the distribution of these secretory proteins in the Golgi, while the ratios between the percent membrane-bound apoB-100 and percent membrane-bound albumin or alpha 2-macroglobulin were 3-4:1 in the ER. This may suggest that apoB-100 occurs in a membrane-associated form in ER prior to the integration in the lipoproteins. Pulse-chase studies combined with subcellular fractionation was used to investigate the kinetics for the intracellular transfer of apoB-100. A 3-min pulse of [35S]methionine was followed by an increase in apoB-100 radioactivity in the ER during the first 10-15 min of chase. The following 10-15 min of chase were characterized by linear decrease in apoB-100 radioactivity with a decay rate of approximately 6%/min. The residence kinetics for apoB-100 in the ER differed from that of transferrin and probably also from that of albumin. By comparing the time for the pulse maximum in ER with that in the denser Golgi fractions the time needed for the transfer between ER and Golgi could be estimated to be 10 min. The time needed for the secretion of newly synthesized apoB-100 was estimated to be 30 min. This indicates that the transfer of the protein through the Golgi apparatus to the extracellular space requires 20 min."

https://openalex.org/W1521754963,"The genes coding for three of the proteins of the lipid transport system, apolipoproteins A-I (apoA-I), C-III (apoC-III), and A-IV (apoA-IV), are closely linked and tandemly organized as a multigene family in the human genome. The evolution of this multigene family was studied by cloning and extensive restriction mapping analysis of an approximately 20-kilobase genomic DNA fragment containing the rat apoA-I gene. Low stringency hybridization blotting analysis of this DNA fragment using human apoC-III and apoA-IV cDNA probes revealed that the apoA-I, apoC-III, and apoA-IV genes are also closely linked and tandemly organized in the rat genome. Complete characterization of the rat apoA-I, apoC-III, and apoA-IV genes showed that their relative location, size, direction of transcription, and intron-exon organization are remarkably similar to those of the corresponding human genes. The relative steady state apoA-I, apoC-III, and apoA-IV mRNA levels in various rat tissues were determined by quantitative dot blot hybridization of tissue total RNA using the corresponding gene probes. Adult liver and intestine, but not colon, brain, spleen, muscle, heart, lung, and kidney, contain apoA-I, apoC-III, and apoA-IV mRNAs. Fetal liver and intestine contain apoA-I but not apoC-III or apoA-IV mRNAs. During neonatal development the liver contains apoA-I and apoC-III but not apoA-IV while the intestine contains apoA-I, apoC-III, and substantial amounts of apoA-IV mRNAs. In adulthood and during aging both liver and intestine contain all three apoA-I, apoC-III, and apoA-IV mRNAs. These results indicate that the apolipoprotein A-I/C-III/A-IV multigene family was established before mammalian radiation and suggest that these genes are similarly organized in the genomes of all mammals. In addition, these results indicate that expression of the rat apoA-I, apoC-III, and apoA-IV genes is liver- and intestine-specific and regulated by fetal-, neonatal-, and aging-related factors."
https://openalex.org/W1506033534,"NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase-catalyzed reduction of paraquat promoted the release of iron from ferritin. Aerobically, iron release was inhibited approximately 60% by superoxide dismutase, whereas xanthine oxidase-dependent iron release was inhibited nearly 100%. This suggests that both superoxide and the paraquat cation radical can catalyze the release of iron from ferritin. Accordingly, under anaerobic conditions, the paraquat radical mediated a very rapid, complete release of iron from ferritin. Similarly, the cation free radicals of the closely related chemicals, diquat and benzyl viologen, also promoted iron release. ESR studies demonstrated that electron transfer from the paraquat cation radical to ferritin accounts for the reductive release of iron. The ferritin structure was not altered by exposure to the paraquat radical and also retained its ability to re-incorporate iron. These studies indicate that release of iron from ferritin may be a common feature contributing to free radical-mediated toxicities."

https://openalex.org/W1586939748,"Intracellular pH (pHi) of human platelets was measured with the fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)5,6-carboxyfluorescein under various conditions. Stimulation by thrombin at 23 degrees C caused a biphasic change in pHi (initial pHi 7.09); a rapid fall of 0.01-0.04 units (correlated with the rise of [Ca2+]i measured with quin2) followed after 10-15 s by a sustained rise of 0.1-0.15 units pHi. The fall of pHi and [Ca2+]i mobilization was reduced by early (5 s) addition of hirudin, but the later elevated pHi was not reversed by hirudin added after 30 s, although this strips thrombin from receptors and rapidly returns [Ca2+]i to basal levels. In Na+-free medium, or in presence of the Na+/H+ antiport inhibitors, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride (DMA) or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), thrombin caused a greater fall of pHi (0.22-0.26 units) that was sustained. DMA or EIPA could also reverse the alkalinization response to thrombin. Ca2+ ionophores (ionomycin, A23187) decreased platelet pHi by 0.02-0.15 units, but without an increase of pHi comparable to that following thrombin; DMA and EIPA enhanced the fall of pHi (0.14-0.33 units). Cytoplasmic acidification produced by nigericin (K+/H+ ionophore) was followed by return towards normal that was abolished by Na+/H+ antiport inhibitors. The phorbol diester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate had little effect on resting pHi but increased the rate of recovery 2-3-fold after cytoplasmic acidification by nigericin, ionomycin, or sodium propionate. These results indicate that elevation of [Ca2+]i by thrombin enhances H+ production, but the subsequent alkalinization is independent of receptor occupancy or elevated [Ca2+]i and stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter by thrombin probably involves some mechanism apart from regulation by H+ and protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1581207574,"When dihydrocytochalasin (dhCB) was added either prior to or after CHO-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), the rate and duration of superoxide production in human granulocytes stimulated by fMLP was augmented. This effect was maximal when dhCB was added before fMLP, increasing the rate 1.5-3-fold. The effect of dhCB was progressively diminished for later additions and was undetectable after 6-10 min. The effects of dhCB could be blocked by the additional presence of 10 microM t-Boc-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe (where t-Boc is t-butoxycarbonyl) indicating a requirement for receptor occupancy. In the presence of dhCB, the reversible binding of fML[3H]P was elevated and the formation of slowly dissociating surface complexes of occupied receptor and cytoskeleton was inhibited. Myeloperoxidase and lactoferrin release from fMLP-stimulated cells was induced by dhCB but was only partially correlated with the potentiating effects of dhCB on superoxide production and receptor expression. To circumvent the complicating effects of degranulation on the analysis of the functional consequences of receptor-cytoskeletal associations, cells were also preincubated with 100 nM fMLP at 15 degrees C. Under these conditions, the majority of the surface receptors became irreversibly occupied and coisolated with the cytoskeletal fraction of the cell. Subsequent exposure of the cells to fMLP at 37 degrees C resulted in no superoxide production. This desensitization was blocked by dhCB which also inhibited coisolation of the ligand and cytoskeletons. Conversion of receptor to a slowly dissociating state may represent its trapping in an inactive form and would provide a role for receptor-cytoskeleton interactions in the termination of the granulocyte response to chemoattractants. The inhibition of such receptor sequestration and the induction of new receptor expression could, therefore, partially account for dhCB-induced potentiation of the fMLP response."
https://openalex.org/W1595294831,"The proposed ligand binding domain of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor consists of a 40-amino acid cysteine-rich unit that is repeated with some variation seven times. We describe here a mutant allele at the LDL receptor locus in which one of the seven repeats has been deleted. This mutation was found in a patient with the clinical syndrome of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. By molecular cloning, we show that the deletion arose by homologous recombination between repetitive Alu sequences in intron 4 and intron 5 of the gene. The deletion removes exon 5, which normally encodes the sixth repeat of the ligand binding domain. In the resultant mRNA, exon 4 is spliced to exon 6, preserving the reading frame. This mRNA produces a shortened protein that reaches the cell surface and reacts with anti-receptor antibodies but does not bind LDL, which contains apoprotein B-100 as its major protein component. Surprisingly, the deleted protein retains the ability to bind and internalize beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein, a lipoprotein that contains apoprotein E as well as apoprotein B-100. These data support the hypothesis that the seven repeated sequences in the receptor constitute the LDL binding domain. The data further indicate that the sixth repeat is required for binding of LDL, but not beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein, and that deletion of a single cysteine-rich repeat can alter the binding specificity of the LDL receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2033466465,"Replication of the Xenopus laevis 5S RNA gene in vitro is unimpeded by the presence of a complete transcription complex assembled on the internal control region of the gene. The transcription complex is disrupted by passage of the replication fork, specific transcription factors are displaced, and the daughter 5S RNA genes are inactivated. We have been unable to demonstrate that any “memory” of the preexisting transcription complex is transmitted to the daughter DNA duplexes following replication."
https://openalex.org/W1531393608,"The gluconate (gnt) operon of Bacillus subtilis has been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence (5482 base pairs) revealed four open reading frames, each of which was preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. These four frames were designated from the 5'-end as gntR, gntK, gntP, and gntZ. The gntR and gntK genes overlapped by 5 bases. The gntK and gntP gene products (consisting of 513 and 448 amino acids) were identified as gluconate kinase and permease, respectively, by means of insertional inactivation and deletion analysis of these genes subcloned in plasmid pC194. The functions of the gntR and gntZ gene products (243 and 468 amino acids) are presently unknown. S1 nuclease mapping and subcloning in a promoter probe vector (pPL603B) provided evidence that the gnt operon was transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. Besides the gnt promoter about 40 base pairs upstream of the gntR gene, we detected two overlapping internal promoters between the gntP and gntZ genes. The gnt transcripts terminate about 45 base pairs downstream of the gntZ gene."
https://openalex.org/W1997723742,"Hybridoma technology has made it possible to prepare monoclonal antibodies with the use of murine lymphocytes. Attempts to extend this technology to the human level, however, have met with difficulties. A method has been developed for making human monoclonal antibodies of predetermined specificity. Biotinylated antigens (human thyroglobulin or tetanus toxoid) were incubated with human B lymphocytes from peripheral blood. The lymphocytes to which the antigens bound were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Positively selected (high fluorescence) and negatively selected (low fluorescence) cells were then transformed with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and grown in microculture wells. All wells from the positively selected fraction produced antigen-specific antibody (95 to 1800 nanogram-equivalents per milliliter), whereas fewer than 6% of the wells from negatively selected fraction made any detectable antibody (less than 10 nanogram-equivalents per milliliter). When the positively selected EBV-transformed cells were cultured in limiting dilution, clones were obtained that made antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies. By this method, monoclonal antibodies to both foreign antigens and autoantigens can be prepared from the normal human B-cell repertoire."

https://openalex.org/W1538158127,"Interactions between homogeneous acetate kinase and proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS) were studied. The phosphorylation of D-glucose was followed spectrophotometrically using a coupled assay system, and acetate kinase and GTP were found to substitute for phosphoenolpyruvate provided that each of the PTS proteins was present in the mixture. To further define the phosphoryl transfer reaction pathway, the system was simplified to include only the homogeneous, soluble PTS proteins. 32P was transferred from [gamma-32P]ATP to the protein IIIGlc, but this transfer reaction required acetate kinase, and the PTS proteins Enzyme I and HPr. These results suggested that acetate kinase interacts with the first protein in the PTS sequence, Enzyme I. Acetate kinase was therefore incubated with [32P] phospho-Enzyme I, and a direct transfer of the phosphoryl group was observed without the addition of any other protein. These results show that there is a reversible transfer of the phosphoryl group between Enzyme I and acetate kinase. The possible role of this interaction in regulating sugar uptake by the Krebs cycle is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1504455862,"Using exogenous 125I-ubiquitin, ubiquitin-lens protein conjugation was observed with supernatants of cultured rabbit lens epithelial cells and lens cortex tissue. Conjugation was ATP-dependent with the greatest variety and amount of conjugates larger than 150 kDa. In vivo production of ubiquitin-protein conjugates in cultured rabbit and beef lens epithelial cells and rabbit lens tissues of different developmental age was established using immunological detection. There were limited similarities between conjugates found in youngest as opposed to oldest tissue. Cultured rabbit cells contained 27 pmol/mg free ubiquitin and 18 pmol/mg conjugated ubiquitin. Levels of free ubiquitin in lens tissue epithelium, cortex, and core were 36, 5, and 5 pmol/mg, respectively. There were only 2 pmol/mg conjugated ubiquitin in each of these tissues. Hydrolysis of 125I-ubiquitin was catalyzed by supernatants of cultured lens cells, beef and human lens tissues, and reticulocytes. Degradation was greatest in epithelial tissues, and least in core. This corroborates studies which show that proteolytic capabilities are attenuated in older tissue. Decreased initiation of proteolysis by ubiquitination as well as diminished proteolysis in older lens tissue may be related to the accumulation of damaged proteins in aging lens tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2112055913,"recA protein promotes the homologous pairing of single strands with duplex DNA by polymerizing on the single strands to make presynaptic nucleoprotein filaments which are polyvalent with respect to duplex DNA and which consequently form large networks or coaggregates when duplex DNA is added. Previous work has shown that efficient homologous pairing occurs within these networks. In the experiments described here, we observed that the length of the duplex DNA determined the stability of coaggregates, their steady state level, and the yield of joint molecules. Correspondingly, heterologous duplex DNA when preincubated with presynaptic filaments excluded subsequently added homologous duplex DNA from coaggregates and inhibited homologous pairing; the extents of exclusion and inhibition were determined by the length of the heterologous duplex DNA. On the other hand, long heterologous duplex DNA when added together with short homologous duplex DNA was capable of stimulating the absorption of the homologous molecules into coaggregates and increasing the rate of homologous pairing. In reactions involving short duplex molecules, polyamines exerted comparable effects on coaggregation and homologous pairing. We conclude that coaggregates are instrumental in homologous pairing, that they constitute distinct domains that are responsible for the processive or first order character of the pairing reaction, and that they act by concentrating DNA and facilitating diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W1906401409,"High multiplicity of GSH S-transferases (GST) with overlapping substrate specificities may be essential to their multiple roles in xenobiotics metabolism, drug biotransformation, and protection against peroxidative damage. Subunit composition analysis of rat liver GSH S-transferases indicated that heterodimer associations were not random, limiting the generation of GST isozyme multiplicity. We have analyzed a Yb subunit cDNA clone, pGTR187, that may correspond to an anionic Yb subunit sequence. Comparison with other GSH S-transferase cDNA sequences and blot hybridization results indicates that the multiple Yb subunits are encoded by a multigene family. This Yb subunit sequence has very limited homology to Ya and Yc subunit cDNAs, but slightly more sequence homology to the Yp subunit cDNA. More consistent sequence homology is found at the amino acid level with 28% conservation throughout the coding sequences. These results and results published from other laboratories clearly indicate that rat GSH S-transferases are products of at least four different gene families that constitute a supergene family. Conceptually, the supergene family may encode GSH S-transferases of very different structures that are essential to metabolize a multitude of xenobiotics in addition to serving other physiologically important functions."
https://openalex.org/W1883249023,"We have examined phosphorylation of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor in cultured sympathetic neurons and PC12 cells. Dissociated rat superior cervical ganglion neurons or PC12 cells were incubated with 32Pi to label cellular phosphoproteins. Membrane proteins were solubilized, and NGF receptor proteins were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 192-IgG. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography showed that NGF receptor components of Mr = 80,000 and Mr = 210,000 were phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of neither species was affected by treating the cells with NGF or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. When the 80,000-Da protein was subjected to complete trypsin proteolysis and then analyzed by reverse phase liquid chromatography, two 32P-labeled peptides were resolved. The more hydrophobic peptide accounted for most of the 32P and contained only phosphoserine; the other peptide contained phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. No phosphotyrosine was detected in the receptor proteins. When receptor molecules from nonlabeled PC12 cells were immunoprecipitated and then incubated in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP and the cAMP-independent protein kinase FA/GSK-3, phosphorylation occurred predominantly on serine and to a lesser extent on threonine. However, the immunoprecipitated receptor proteins neither autophosphorylated nor were they detectably phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase II, or protein kinase C (the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme). We conclude that binding units of the NGF receptor are phosphorylated constitutively in at least two sites in intact cells and that they can be phosphorylated by FA/GSK-3 in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2014718917,"Kinetics of mouse T-cell gamma gene rearrangements in ontogeny were determined as an approach to understanding the possible role of these genes in the development of fetal thymocytes. Two of these genes (C gamma 1 and C gamma 2) rearranged rapidly during days 14 to 17 of the gestational period in BALB/c mice. Moreover, these rearrangements seemed to be tightly synchronized with rearrangements of T-cell receptor beta chain genes in the same cells. It is suggested that the early transcriptional activity of gamma genes, which precedes that of beta chain genes, may not reflect the functional activation of these genes. Nevertheless, productive and therefore potentially functional gamma gene rearrangements precede surface expression of T-cell receptors in the thymus by 2 to 3 days, which is compatible with a role for gamma gene products in thymocyte development prior to antigen-specific stages."
https://openalex.org/W1578972885,"We have used pulse-chase techniques to study the synthesis, intracellular modification, and secretion of human apolipoprotein E by cultures of HepG2 cells and peripheral blood human monocyte macrophages. We have found that modified apoE isoproteins are detectable intracellularly after 14 min of pulse, and their relative concentration increases linearly over a 2-h pulse-chase period. At the same time, the relative concentration of unmodified apoE decreases. All the major modified apoE isoproteins appear simultaneously, and they correspond to the sialo apoE forms apooEs2, apoEs4, and apoEs6. ApoE secretion is first detected after a 30-min pulse. Secreted apoE consists of 92% of the same sialated apoE forms observed intracellularly. ApoE sialation and secretion were not affected by treatment of the HepG2 cultures with tunicamycin, whereas monensin inhibited both the intracellular sialation and secretion of this protein. These findings suggest that apoE is secreted in the form of three major isoproteins generated by intracellular modification of this protein with one or more O-linked oligosaccharide chains containing sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2157318791,"We have used temperature-sensitive COS cells to design delayed competition experiments in which competition for simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer factors occurs after enhancer-dependent transcription has been established. The results demonstrate that competition for SV40 enhancer-binding factors has no effect on enhancer-dependent transcription after transcription has been established at the SV40 early promoter. These data show that the enhancer and factors that bind to it are involved in the establishment of stable transcription complexes, although they do not show whether enhancer factors are an integral part of the transcription complexes. Furthermore, the results of delayed competition experiments with a replicating test plasmid are consistent with the possibility that enhancer-dependent stable transcription complexes could be maintained after DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1516804259,"The effects of various lectins on the interaction of the human cervical carcinoma cell line ME-180 with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF-alpha) was investigated. rTNF-alpha is known to have cytotoxic effects on this tumor cell line and has been reported to interact with these cells through a single class of specific high affinity receptors (Kd = 0.45 nM; approximately 1790 binding sites/cell). Exposure of cells to concanavalin A (ConA) causes an approximately 2-fold increase in rTNF-alpha receptors without any significant change in their affinity constant (Kd = 0.36 nM; approximately 3662 binding sites/cell). This increase in receptor number is dependent on temperature, the time of exposure and dose of ConA, and does not require the synthesis of new proteins. In spite of an increased binding of rTNF-alpha to cells, the cell killing induced by rTNF-alpha is totally blocked by ConA. Cells are also protected by this lectin from the synergistic cytotoxic effects of rTNF-alpha and recombinant human interferon-gamma. Furthermore, it was also found that ConA decreases the rate of internalization and dramatically inhibits the release and degradation of rTNF-alpha by the cells. These results, overall, demonstrate that ConA increases total number of binding sites for rTNF-alpha but blocks the transduction of the signal for the cytotoxic response."

Since the 5-propyl analog of kadsurenone (dihydrokadsurenone) retains roughly the same potency as kadsurenone, [3H]dihydrokadsurenone was therefore synthesized through tritiation of kadsurenone. Specific binding of [3H]dihydrokadsurenone in rabbit platelet membranes is saturable. Scatchard analysis of binding data reveals the presence of a single class of binding sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 16.81 ( +/- 0.57) nM. The total number (Bmax) of detectable binding sites is 2.27 ( +/- 0.09) pmol/mg protein. Both C16- and C18-PAF fully displace the specific binding of (3H]dihydrokadsurenone (5 nM) with an identical ED50 of 3.6 X 10(-9) M. Dihydrokadsurenone and kadsurenone also displace the specific binding with roughly the same potency (ED50 = 4.4 X 10(-8) M). Several other PAF analogs and PAF receptor antagonists tested show relative potencies roughly similar to those found in the [3H]PAF-specific binding assay. Other pharmacological agents with no PAF antagonistic activities did not inhibit the specific binding of [3H]dihydrokadsurenone. These results agree with our previous conclusion that kadsurenone is a specific and competitive receptor antagonist and strongly suggest that PAF and the PAF receptor antagonists tested may interact at a common binding site in the PAF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1763052662,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors were solubilized from rat pituitary membrane preparations in an active form by using the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid). The solubilized receptor exhibits high affinity, saturability, and specificity. The soluble supernatant retained 100% of the original binding activity when stored at 4 or -20 degrees C in the presence of 10% glycerol. The receptors were resolved into two components on the basis of chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. Homogeneous receptor preparation was obtained by two cycles of affinity chromatography on immobilized avidin column coupled to [biotinyl-D-Lys6]GnRH. The overall recovery of the purified receptor was 4-10% of the initial activity in the CHAPS extract, and the calculated purification -fold was approximately 10,000 to 15,000. Analysis of iodinated purified GnRH receptors by autoradiography indicated the presence of two bands, Mr = 59,000 and 57,000. This was confirmed by photoaffinity labeling of the partially purified receptors and suggests that both components can specifically bind the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1515710753,"Previous Mossbauer and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies of oxidized hydrogenase I (bidirectional) from Clostridium pasteurianum W5 demonstrated that this enzyme contains two diamagnetic [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters and an iron-sulfur center of unknown structure and composition that is characterized by its novel Mossbauer and ENDOR properties. In the present study we combine ENDOR and EPR measurements to show that the novel cluster contains 3-4 iron atoms. In addition, we have used EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies to investigate the effect of binding the competitive inhibitor carbon monoxide to oxidized hydrogenase I, using 13C-labeled CO and enzyme isotopically enriched in 57Fe. Treatment of oxidized enzyme with CO causes the g-tensor of the paramagnetic center to change from rhombic to axial symmetry. The observation of a 13C signal by ENDOR spectroscopy and analysis of the EPR broadening show that a single CO covalently binds to the paramagnetic center. The 13C hyperfine coupling constant (Ac approximately equal to 21 MHz) is within the range observed for inorganic iron-carbonyl clusters. The observation of 57Fe ENDOR signals from two types of iron site ([A1c] approximately 30-34 MHz; [A2c] approximately 6 MHz) and resolved 57Fe hyperfine interactions in the EPR spectrum from two nuclei characterized by [A1c] confirm that the iron-sulfur cluster remains intact upon CO coordination, but show that CO binding greatly changes the 57Fe hyperfine coupling constants."
https://openalex.org/W1591573176,"Uridine kinase from mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells may exist at 4 degrees C in multiple aggregation states that only slowly equilibrate with one another. Increasing the temperature leads to dissociation, and the appearance of a single predominant species: at 22 degrees C the enzyme exists as a tetramer. There is also a break in the dependence of enzyme activity on temperature as measured in an Arrhenius plot. The feedback inhibitors CTP and UTP cause the enzyme to dissociate to the monomer, whereas the substrate ATP reverses this process. Kinetic studies show that the monomer has little or no activity. Studies of the reaction mechanism show that binding of substrates is ordered, leading to a ternary complex, and release of products is ordered: uridine is the first substrate bound, ADP the first product released. Except for the inhibitors UTP and CTP, all other nucleoside triphosphates, whether purine or pyrimidine, or containing ribose or deoxyribose, act as phosphate donor. Especially interesting are the opposite effects of CTP and dCTP on uridine kinase: unlike CTP, dCTP does not dissociate the enzyme and is competent as a phosphate donor. We propose that the various effects of different ligands are best explained by the existence of a regulatory site (with more stringent specificity than the catalytic site) that controls dissociation of uridine kinase to the inactive monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1538029170,"It has been reported that the mitochondrial cytochromes and citrate cycle enzymes occur in constant proportions to each other and increase or decrease roughly in parallel in response to various stimuli. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this proportionality is an obligatory consequence of the way in which mitochondria are assembled. Severe iron deficiency was used to bring about decreases of the iron-containing constituents of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in skeletal muscle. Cytochrome c concentration and cytochrome oxidase activity were decreased approximately 50%, while succinate dehydrogenase and NADH dehydrogenase activities were decreased by 78% in iron-deficient muscle. On electron microscopic examination, mitochondria in iron-deficient muscles had relatively sparse numbers of cristae. The iron deficiency had little or no effect on the levels of a range of mitochondrial matrix enzymes, including citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarase, aspartate aminotransferase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacid-CoA transferase, and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase. These results show that the usual constant proportions between the constituents of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and matrix enzymes are not obligatory; they provide evidence that mitochondrial matrix enzymes and respiratory chain constituents can be incorporated into mitochondria independently and that the ratios between them can vary within wide limits."

https://openalex.org/W1521320504,"Na+,K+-ATPase from pig kidney was specifically modified with a sulfhydryl fluorescent reagent, N-[p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl]maleimide (BIPM), by pretreatment of N-ethylmaleimide. The preparation thus obtained retained 100% of initial Na+,K+-ATPase activity and contained 1 BIPM residue/alpha-chain, and it showed almost 2-fold larger fluorescence changes accompanying ATP hydrolysis than the previous preparations which retained 60% of initial activity and contained 3-4 BIPM residues/alpha-chain (Taniguchi, K., Suzuki, K., and Iida, S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10659-10667). Extensive trypsin (Sigma type I) treatment of the new preparation produced mainly two different fluorescent peptide peaks in both ion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. Amino acid sequence analysis of both peptides showed that they had the same common sequence, Ser-Tyr-X-Pro-Gly-Met-Gly-Val, except that the larger one contained Ala-Leu next to the Val residue. From the comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA from sheep kidney (Shull, G. E., Schwartz, A., and Lingrel, J. B. (1985) Nature 316, 691-695), X was shown to correspond to Cys-964 of the alpha-chain in Na+,K+-ATPase. The data suggest that the microenvironment of the BIPM residue covalently bound to the sulfhydryl group of Cys-964 changes accompanying sequential appearance of reaction intermediates of Na+,K+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1556029143,"Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin and cytochrome c oxidase in separated adult rat heart myocytes has been observed with Fourier transform IR spectroscopy at low temperatures. CO complexes of these two proteins can be spectrally separated through temperature manipulation of the relaxation of the photolyzed systems. Photolyzed carboxymyoglobin relaxes very rapidly above 80 K, whereas the CO photolyzed from cytochrome a3 associates with CuB and relaxes very slowly below 140 K. Cytochrome c oxidase is found to be present in two major molecular forms which we designate alpha and beta. Each form contains an a3Fe and its associated CuB which we observe by their CO complexes. The predominant FeCO band, the alpha form of cytochrome oxidase, is similar to that previously seen in beef heart mitochondria, but with a slightly larger activation enthalpy, delta H = 46 kJ/mol. At least one of the beta forms is similar, but two have not been observed in beef heart mitochondria. Upon photolysis of alpha-FeCO, the alpha-CuCO species is formed. This band splits into two at low temperature. Up to half of the FeCO band area of the intact myocytes is distributed among three or more minor species (beta forms). The beta-FeCO bands all appear to be associated with only one beta-CuCO band which does not split at low temperature. After photo-dissociation of CO, the beta forms relax considerably faster than the alpha form, achieving 50% recombination in 10% of the time required for the alpha form. In a tissue slice from an opossum heart exposed to CO, we observed alpha and beta forms of cytochrome oxidase very similar to those in the rat heart myocytes. The cause of the differences between the alpha and beta forms of the enzyme is unknown, but their possible role in the control of respiration is discussed. Carboxymyoglobin contained within intact rat heart myocytes was very similar to sperm whale carboxymyoglobin, but with a much smaller amount of the lower frequency minor component."
https://openalex.org/W1766881502,"Modelling studies with beta-endorphin have clearly demonstrated that an amphiphilic secondary structural segment is a salient feature of the biologically active conformation of this 31-residue opioid peptide hormone. Here, we have initiated the synthesis of peptide models using unnatural building blocks by designing a beta-endorphin analogue (peptide 6) in which the hydrophilic linker region between the NH2-terminal enkephalin (residues 1-5) and the COOH-terminal helix (residues 10-28, sequence identical to that of peptide 3 in region 13-31, Fig. 1) consists of four units of gamma-amino-gamma-hydroxymethylbutyric acid connected by isopeptidic linkages. Peptide 6 has physical properties similar to that of peptide 3, as shown by surface monolayer and circular dichroism studies. The binding affinities of the two peptides to delta- and mu-receptors are also similar. In rat vas deferens assays, the present model is equipotent to peptide 3. The most striking result of all is the potent analgesic activity displayed by peptide 6 when injected intracerebroventricularly into mice. The potencies of peptides 6 and 3 are comparable in these assays. These studies clearly illustrate that one can use unusual building blocks to construct structural regions of synthetic analogues and still preserve the biological activity of peptide hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1520005266,"The effect of pyrophosphate on the fidelity of in vitro DNA synthesis has been examined. Pyrophosphate enhances misincorporation by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I in copying phi X174 DNA. The increased misincorporation is directly proportional to the extent of inhibition of the rate of polymerization. In contrast, pyrophosphate is not detectably mutagenic with avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase or DNA polymerases alpha and beta from animal cells, which lack associated proofreading activities. This suggests that increased misincorporation by pyrophosphate is not due to an increase in misinsertions by DNA polymerase, but rather due to inhibition of proofreading by pyrophosphate. However, the pyrophosphate-induced infidelity has a different specificity from, and is not competitive with, two experimental markers of 3'----5' exonuclease proofreading; i.e. the effects of the next nucleotide or the addition of deoxynucleoside monophosphates. These distinctive features suggest a second mode of proofreading susceptible to inhibition by pyrophosphate. This concept is discussed in relation to models for proofreading described in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W1551655244,"The rat apolipoprotein E gene was isolated from a genomic library by screening with a cDNA probe. The nucleotide sequence of the gene plus a 5' flanking region of 623 nucleotides and a 3' flanking region of 234 nucleotides was determined. The gene contained three introns, which were located in the 5' nontranslated region and in the regions coding for the signal peptide and the mature protein. A box sequence TATAATT was found beginning at nucleotide -32. Two copies of the sequences GGGCGG or CCGCCC, potential binding sites for the transcription protein factor Sp 1, were found adjacent to the TATA box, beginning at nucleotides -52 and -72. The 5' proximal flanking region, up to about 140 nucleotides, was found to be highly conserved (82% homology) in the gene for rat and human. This region was GC-rich (68% G + C) and contained self-complementary sequences with the potential to form hairpin loop structures, suggesting a regulatory role of this region in gene transcription. Two open reading frames with promoter sequences were found, one located in the first and the other in the second intron. Expression of rat apolipoprotein E mRNA in murine L cells transfected with the cloned gene was detected at levels comparable to that in rat liver. Rat apolipoprotein E expressed in transfected cells was secreted from the cells into the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1605564324,"Membrane transport of long chain fatty acids in the isolated adipocyte can be stimulated 5-10-fold by epinephrine (Abumrad, N. A., Perry, P. R., and Whitesell, R. R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9969-9971). This study shows that isoproterenol and norepinephrine are more potent than epinephrine in activating the transport process. The stimulatory effect on transport is mediated by beta-receptor interaction and cAMP. This was shown by the following. alpha-Receptor agonists and antagonists were ineffective; methylisobutylxanthine at low concentration (3 microM) potentiated the effect of a suboptimal dose (0.01 microgram/ml) of epinephrine and was stimulatory at high concentration (100 microM) in the absence of epinephrine; and cAMP analogs were very effective activators. Involvement of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase was indicated by two lines of evidence. 1) Combinations of cAMP analogs which are specific for sites 1 and 2 of the protein kinase, respectively, had synergistic effects on fatty acid transport. Combinations of analogs specific for the same site were only additive in their effects. This is similar to the pattern of protein kinase activation in vitro and to that of lipolysis activation in the intact adipocyte (Beebe, S. J., Holloway, R., Rannels, S. R., and Corbin, J. D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3539-3547). 2) Treatment of cells with various metabolic poisons abolished the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine. The response of fatty acid transport to catecholamines showed multiple parallels with that documented for lipolysis except that it was much more rapid. This suggested that the transport process was a regulatory step in fatty acid mobilization. This interpretation is supported by the observation that basal Vmax for transport is much too slow to accommodate the rate of fatty acid release which is observed following stimulation of intact cells with adrenergic hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1604558032,"Two recombinant clones, lambda LC5 and lambda LC13, encompassing the entire regulatory myosin light chain 2 (MLC2A) gene of chicken heart muscle were isolated. Of these, lambda LC5 which contains a large 5'-flanking sequence of about 7.0 kb, was characterized by a partial nucleotide sequence analysis. A TATA-like sequence (TATTTTTA) and a CAAT-box (CAAAAGT) are located at positions -32 and -59, respectively, which most likely constitute the functional promoter region in the gene. Based on primer extension reaction with a synthetic 20-mer corresponding to the 5'-leader sequence and total poly(A+) RNA, the probable transcription initiation site in the gene was located. The gene promoter activity was demonstrated following transient expression of recombinant genomes containing the chicken upstream sequence fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or to the rat preproinsulin II genes. The extracts from a Quail fibroblast cell line (QT35) transfected with the construct (pLCo5.2iCat) containing the putative chicken promoter, and the CAT gene promoted the formation of 3'-acetate chloramphenicol. Another construct (pBC12LC5.2f) contains the rat preproinsulin II gene placed under the control of chicken promoter and a simian virus 40 origin of replication. Transfection of COS cell line with pBC12LC5.2f DNA resulted in an efficient expression of rat preproinsulin mRNA initiating from the chicken promoter. The transfection assay also allowed detection of chicken MLC2A gene transcripts by S1-nuclease protection of end-labeled DNA probes. A comparison of the MLC2A upstream gene sequence with those available for skeletal myosin light chains revealed no common sequence elements, suggesting that cardiac MLC2A gene promoter region has diverged considerably from its counterparts in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1544139445,"The 1017-bp intron within the cloned phage T4 td gene was deleted by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Induction of thymidylate synthase activity and mature td mRNA from this intronless construct (pKTd delta I) was compared both in vivo and in vitro with expression from plasmids bearing td genes in which the introns contain either no change (pKTd2), an XbaI linker inserted about 200 nucleotides from the 3'-end (pKTdX-1), or a deletion of two-thirds of the central portion (pKTd delta 1-3). Slightly more synthase accumulated in cells carrying pKTd delta I as compared to the other td genes when induction was performed at 30, 37, or 42 degrees C. Dramatically different results were observed in vitro, where enzyme activity synthesized from pKTd delta I DNA appeared earlier and reached severalfold higher levels than with pKTd2 DNA. In addition, thymidylate synthase expression from pKTdX-1 was impaired relative to pKTd2, while pKTd delta 1-3 accumulated enzyme at levels intermediate between those of pKTd2 and pKTd delta I. Under both in vivo and in vitro conditions, increasing levels of mature td mRNA preceded and paralleled those in enzyme activity for all four plasmids, demonstrating comparable translation of the mRNAs produced. From these results it would appear that the splicing of td RNA is much more efficient in vivo than in vitro, suggesting that other cellular components may facilitate in vivo processing of this intron-containing transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1603150956,"Ten min after infection of Xanthomonas campestris pv. oryzae by phage Xp10, a sharp decrease in the activity of the host RNA polymerase was observed. Host RNA polymerase from phage-infected and uninfected cells was purified, and their properties were compared. The enzyme from uninfected cells contained four polypeptides with Mr = 155,000, 155,000, 93,000, and 37,000, respectively, and assembled with a stoichiometry of alpha 2 beta beta' sigma. The enzyme from infected cells lacked the sigma-subunit. The enzyme from uninfected cells utilized Xp10 DNA and poly[d(A-T)] as templates, the enzyme from phage-infected cells failed to transcribe Xp10 DNA, but retained the ability to transcribe poly(A-T). The regions of the Xp10 genome transcribed by the two enzymes were also investigated. The enzyme from uninfected cells transcribed the leftmost 25-30% of the Xp10 genome. The enzyme from phage-infected cells also transcribed the same region, but the enzyme activity was very low. Other properties such as (a) the response to RNA polymerase inhibitors, (b) the effect of N-ethylmaleimide, (c) the requirement of Mg2+ and Mn2+, and (d) the optimum temperature and pH of the two enzymes were very similar."
https://openalex.org/W1488071934,"Pulsed and oxygenated forms of cytochrome c oxidase are believed to be variants of the oxidized enzyme. They were produced as a consequence of one or more reduction-oxidation cycles of the resting form and are characterized by an increase of the alpha band intensity and a red-shift of the Soret absorption band to 428 nm. The rate of decay of these species back to the resting enzyme varies appreciably and appears to depend on the nature of the reductant and/or oxidant used in their preparation. Here we report that if resting oxidase is incubated with either reduced or oxidized cytochrome c and then exposed to dioxygen, an activated form is rapidly produced which appears to be more oxidized than the starting material. This finding suggest some degree of partial reduction of the resting enzyme, but this by itself cannot explain the extent of activation. Our results further question the significance of the optical spectral signature of the oxygenated (Okunuki, K., and Sekuzu, I. (1954) Seitaino Kagaka 5, 265-272), pulsed (Antonini, E., Brunori, M., Colosimo, A., Greenwood, C., and Wilson, M. T. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W1510370324,"An artificial hybrid hemoglobin, alpha(Co)2 beta(Fe)2, the alpha- and beta-subunits of which contain cobaltous and ferrous protoporphyrins IX, respectively, and its complementary hybrid, alpha(Fe)2 beta(Co)2, were prepared from human hemoglobin, crystallized in the deoxy state, and examined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The orientations of the porphyrin normals in these deoxy Fe-Co hybrid hemoglobins in terms of the g parallel signals, were closely coincident with those of the heme normals of deoxyhemoglobin determined by x-ray crystallography. Two sets of axially symmetric EPR signals were found in the alpha(Co)-subunits, whereas only one set was observed in the beta(Co)-subunits. Nonequivalence in the electronic structures of the prosthetic groups between the two alpha(Co)-subunits, designated alpha I and alpha II, within deoxy-alpha(Co)2 beta(Fe)2 hybrid hemoglobin was correlated to these two distinct EPR signals. The interaction between the epsilon-nitrogen of the imidazole ring of the proximal histidine and the cobaltous ion in deoxy-alpha I(Co)-subunit is different from that in the deoxy-alpha II(Co)-subunit. The absence of a strict molecular dyad axis in the deoxy-alpha(Co)2 beta(Fe)2 hybrid hemoglobin suggests that the affinity state of the alpha(Co)-subunits may be partially switched to the R-state having a higher affinity for oxygen. Upon partial ligation of carbon monoxide to the beta(Fe)-subunits, the line width of the g parallel and perpendicular signals of the alpha II(Co)-subunit was found to become somewhat narrower without disruption of the crystal structure. This suggests that there may be very close contacts between the alpha- and beta-subunits of different hemoglobin molecules which appear to be responsible for stabilizing the deoxy crystal structure after partial ligation in the crystalline state."
