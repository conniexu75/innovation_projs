https://openalex.org/W1996812337,"The recently discovered layered rare-earth metal oxypnictides have reinvigorated research into high-temperature superconductivity. The first of these, found only a few months ago, had a transition temperature of 26 K. A recent paper in Nature reported an iron–arsenic-based material superconducting at 43 K with the application of pressure. Previously only copper oxides superconductors had beaten the 40 K barrier. Now Chen et al. report bulk superconductivity in the samarium–arsenide oxide SmFeAsO1−xFx with a transition temperature of 43 K without this pressure. A report on the discovery of bulk superconductivity in samarium-arsenide oxides SmFeAsO1−xFx with a transition temperature as high as 43 K. Since the discovery of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity in layered copper oxides, extensive effort has been devoted to exploring the origins of this phenomenon. A Tc higher than 40 K (about the theoretical maximum predicted from Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory1), however, has been obtained only in the copper oxide superconductors. The highest reported value for non-copper-oxide bulk superconductivity is Tc = 39 K in MgB2 (ref. 2). The layered rare-earth metal oxypnictides LnOFeAs (where Ln is La–Nd, Sm and Gd) are now attracting attention following the discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in the iron-based LaO1-xF x FeAs (ref. 3). Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in the related compound SmFeAsO1-xF x , which has a ZrCuSiAs-type structure. Resistivity and magnetization measurements reveal a transition temperature as high as 43 K. This provides a new material base for studying the origin of high-temperature superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2043474702,"We describe the use of zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) for somatic and germline disruption of genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio), in which targeted mutagenesis was previously intractable. ZFNs induce a targeted double-strand break in the genome that is repaired to generate small insertions and deletions. We designed ZFNs targeting the zebrafish golden and no tail/Brachyury (ntl) genes and developed a budding yeast–based assay to identify the most active ZFNs for use in vivo. Injection of ZFN-encoding mRNA into one-cell embryos yielded a high percentage of animals carrying distinct mutations at the ZFN-specified position and exhibiting expected loss-of-function phenotypes. Over half the ZFN mRNA-injected founder animals transmitted disrupted ntl alleles at frequencies averaging 20%. The frequency and precision of gene-disruption events observed suggest that this approach should be applicable to any loci in zebrafish or in other organisms that allow mRNA delivery into the fertilized egg."
https://openalex.org/W2097685453,"Direct genomic manipulation at a specific locus is still not feasible in most vertebrate model organisms. In vertebrate cell lines, genomic lesions at a specific site have been introduced using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs). Here we adapt this technology to create targeted mutations in the zebrafish germ line. ZFNs were engineered that recognize sequences in the zebrafish ortholog of the vascular endothelial growth factor-2 receptor, kdr (also known as kdra). Co-injection of mRNAs encoding these ZFNs into one-cell-stage zebrafish embryos led to mutagenic lesions at the target site that were transmitted through the germ line with high frequency. The use of engineered ZFNs to introduce heritable mutations into a genome obviates the need for embryonic stem cell lines and should be applicable to most animal species for which early-stage embryos are easily accessible."
https://openalex.org/W4246659915,"Relapse to cocaine use after prolonged abstinence is an important clinical problem. This relapse is often induced by exposure to cues associated with cocaine use. To account for the persistent propensity for relapse, it has been suggested that cue-induced cocaine craving increases over the first several weeks of abstinence and remains high for extended periods. We and others identified an analogous phenomenon in rats that was termed 'incubation of cocaine craving': time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine-seeking over the first months after withdrawal from self-administered cocaine. Cocaine-seeking requires the activation of glutamate projections that excite receptors for alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) in the nucleus accumbens. Here we show that the number of synaptic AMPA receptors in the accumbens is increased after prolonged withdrawal from cocaine self-administration by the addition of new AMPA receptors lacking glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2). Furthermore, we show that these new receptors mediate the incubation of cocaine craving. Our results indicate that GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors could be a new target for drug development for the treatment of cocaine addiction. We propose that after prolonged withdrawal from cocaine, increased numbers of synaptic AMPA receptors combined with the higher conductance of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors causes increased reactivity of accumbens neurons to cocaine-related cues, leading to an intensification of drug craving and relapse."

https://openalex.org/W2147157181,"Observations of individual virions in live cells have led to the characterization of their attachment, entry and intracellular transport. However, the assembly of individual virions has never been observed in real time. Insights into this process have come primarily from biochemical analyses of populations of virions or from microscopic studies of fixed infected cells. Thus, some assembly properties, such as kinetics and location, are either unknown or controversial. Here we describe quantitatively the genesis of individual virions in real time, from initiation of assembly to budding and release. We studied fluorescently tagged derivatives of Gag, the major structural component of HIV-1-which is sufficient to drive the assembly of virus-like particles-with the use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and total-internal-reflection fluorescent microscopy in living cells. Virions appeared individually at the plasma membrane, their assembly rate accelerated as Gag protein accumulated in cells, and typically 5-6 min was required to complete the assembly of a single virion. These approaches allow a previously unobserved view of the genesis of individual virions and the determination of parameters of viral assembly that are inaccessible with conventional techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2041256732,"Understanding the energetics of molecular interactions is fundamental to all of the central quests of structural biology including structure prediction and design, mapping evolutionary pathways, learning how mutations cause disease, drug design, and relating structure to function. Hydrogen-bonding is widely regarded as an important force in a membrane environment because of the low dielectric constant of membranes and a lack of competition from water. Indeed, polar residue substitutions are the most common disease-causing mutations in membrane proteins. Because of limited structural information and technical challenges, however, there have been few quantitative tests of hydrogen-bond strength in the context of large membrane proteins. Here we show, by using a double-mutant cycle analysis, that the average contribution of eight interhelical side-chain hydrogen-bonding interactions throughout bacteriorhodopsin is only 0.6 kcal mol(-1). In agreement with these experiments, we find that 4% of polar atoms in the non-polar core regions of membrane proteins have no hydrogen-bond partner and the lengths of buried hydrogen bonds in soluble proteins and membrane protein transmembrane regions are statistically identical. Our results indicate that most hydrogen-bond interactions in membrane proteins are only modestly stabilizing. Weak hydrogen-bonding should be reflected in considerations of membrane protein folding, dynamics, design, evolution and function."
https://openalex.org/W2051464954,"Detailed analyses of the clone-based genome assembly reveal that the recent duplication content of mouse (4.94%) is now comparable to that of human (5.5%), in contrast to previous estimates from the whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly. However, the architecture of mouse and human genomes differs markedly: most mouse duplications are organized into discrete clusters of tandem duplications that show depletion of genes and transcripts and enrichment of long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) and long terminal repeat (LTR) retroposons. We assessed copy number variation of the C57BL/6J duplicated regions within 15 mouse strains previously used for genetic association studies, sequencing and the Mouse Phenome Project. We determined that over 60% of these base pairs are polymorphic among the strains (on average, there was 20 Mb of copy-number-variable DNA between different mouse strains). Our data suggest that different mouse strains show comparable, if not greater, copy number polymorphism when compared to human; however, such variation is more locally restricted. We show large and complex patterns of interstrain copy number variation restricted to large gene families associated with spermatogenesis, pregnancy, viviparity, pheromone signaling and immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1982432510,"The recognition of terminally misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the extraction of these proteins to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation are determined by a quality control mechanism in the ER. In yeast, Yos9p, an ER lectin containing a mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domain, enhances ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of glycoproteins. We show here that human XTP3-B (hXTP3-B), an ER lectin containing two MRH domains, has two transcriptional variants, and both isoforms retard ERAD of the human alpha(1)-antitrypsin variant null Hong Kong (NHK), a terminally misfolded glycoprotein. The hXTP3-B long isoform strongly inhibited ERAD of NHK-QQQ, which lacks all of the N-glycosylation sites of NHK, but the short transcriptional variant of hXTP3-B had almost no effect. Examination of complex formation by immunoprecipitation and by fractionation using sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed that the hXTP3-B long isoform associates with the HRD1-SEL1L membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase complex and BiP, forming a 27 S ER quality control scaffold complex. The hXTP3-B short isoform, however, is excluded from scaffold formation. Another MRH domain-containing ER lectin, hOS-9, is incorporated into this large complex, but gp78, another mammalian homolog of the yeast ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p, is not. Based on these results, we propose that this large ER quality control scaffold complex, containing ER lectins, a chaperone, and a ubiquitin ligase, provides a platform for the recognition and sorting of misfolded glycoproteins as well as nonglycosylated proteins prior to retrotranslocation into the cytoplasm for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2129745135,"The immunophilin-like FKBP42 TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1) has been shown to control plant development via the positive modulation of ABCB/P-glycoprotein (PGP)-mediated transport of the plant hormone auxin. TWD1 functionally interacts with two closely related proteins, ABCB1/PGP1 and ABCB19/PGP19/MDR1, both of which exhibit the ability to bind to and be inhibited by the synthetic auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphylphtalamic acid (NPA). They are also inhibited by flavonoid compounds, which are suspected modulators of auxin transport. The mechanisms by which flavonoids and NPA interfere with auxin efflux components are unclear. We report here the specific disruption of PGP1-TWD1 interaction by NPA and flavonoids using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer with flavonoids functioning as a classical established inhibitor of mammalian and plant PGPs. Accordingly, TWD1 was shown to mediate modulation of PGP1 efflux activity by these auxin transport inhibitors. NPA bound to both PGP1 and TWD1 but was excluded from the PGP1-TWD1 complex expressed in yeast, suggesting a transient mode of action in planta. As a consequence, auxin fluxes and gravitropism in twd1 roots are less affected by NPA treatment, whereas TWD1 gain-of-function promotes root bending.

A new study identifies a list of genes synergistically regulated by the Ras oncogene and loss of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Many of these genes are essential for tumour formation in vivo, whereas few of the genes regulated by either Ras or p53 alone are important. This establishes a new approach to finding genes important in tumorigenesis that may also represent novel targets for tumour therapy. A new study identifies a list of genes synergistically regulated by the Ras oncogene and loss of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. A high proportion of these genes are essential for tumour formation in vivo, whereas only very few of the genes regulated by only either Ras or p53 are important. This establishes a new approach to finding genes important in tumourigenesis that may also represent novel targets for tumour therapy. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of cancer is of critical importance to the development of targeted intervention strategies. Identification of such targets, however, is notoriously difficult and unpredictable. Malignant cell transformation requires the cooperation of a few oncogenic mutations that cause substantial reorganization of many cell features1 and induce complex changes in gene expression patterns2,3,4,5,6. Genes critical to this multifaceted cellular phenotype have therefore only been identified after signalling pathway analysis7,8,9,10 or on an ad hoc basis4,11,12,13,14. Our observations that cell transformation by cooperating oncogenic lesions depends on synergistic modulation of downstream signalling circuitry15,16,17 suggest that malignant transformation is a highly cooperative process, involving synergy at multiple levels of regulation, including gene expression. Here we show that a large proportion of genes controlled synergistically by loss-of-function p53 and Ras activation are critical to the malignant state of murine and human colon cells. Notably, 14 out of 24 ‘cooperation response genes’ were found to contribute to tumour formation in gene perturbation experiments. In contrast, only 1 in 14 perturbations of the genes responding in a non-synergistic manner had a similar effect. Synergistic control of gene expression by oncogenic mutations thus emerges as an underlying key to malignancy, and provides an attractive rationale for identifying intervention targets in gene networks downstream of oncogenic gain- and loss-of-function mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2057896776,"Protein Arg methyltransferases function as coactivators of the tumor suppressor p53 to regulate gene expression. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4/PADI4) counteracts the functions of protein Arg methyltransferases in gene regulation by deimination and demethylimination. Here we show that the expression of a tumor suppressor gene, <i>OKL38</i>, is activated by the inhibition of PAD4 or the activation of p53 following DNA damage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a dynamic change of p53 and PAD4 occupancy and histone Arg modifications at the <i>OKL38</i> promoter during DNA damage, suggesting a direct role of PAD4 and p53 in the expression of OKL38. Furthermore, we found that OKL38 induces apoptosis through localization to mitochondria and induction of cytochrome <i>c</i> release. Together, our studies identify <i>OKL38</i> as a novel p53 target gene that is regulated by PAD4 and plays a role in apoptosis."

The active/deactive transition could play an important role in the regulation of complex I activity. It has been suggested recently that complex I may become modified by S-nitrosation under pathological conditions during hypoxia or when the nitric oxide:oxygen ratio increases. Apparently, a specific cysteine becomes accessible to chemical modification only in the deactive form of the enzyme. By selective fluorescence labeling and proteomic analysis, we have identified this residue as cysteine-39 of the mitochondrially encoded ND3 subunit of bovine heart mitochondria. Cysteine-39 is located in a loop connecting the first and second transmembrane helix of this highly hydrophobic subunit. We propose that this loop connects the ND3 subunit of the membrane arm with the PSST subunit of the peripheral arm of complex I, placing it in a region that is known to be critical for the catalytic mechanism of complex I. In fact, mutations in three positions of the loop were previously reported to cause Leigh syndrome with and without dystonia or progressive mitochondrial disease.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar for a review). This lag phase is abolished after brief preincubation of the enzyme under conditions where NAD(P)H:ubiquinone oxidoreductase turnover is permitted, thus providing reactivation of the enzyme (15Kotlyar A.B.

Only the rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activities in different species undergo the A/D transition, whereas the non-physiological NADH-dehydrogenase activities using ferricyanide or hexaammineruthenium (III) as electron acceptors are the same for active and deactive enzyme. It was initially observed by Estabrook's group (21Estabrook R.W. Tyler D.D. Gonze J. Peterson J.A Flavines and Flavoproteins. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo, Japan1968: 268-279Google Scholar) that the NADH-oxidase reaction of complex I becomes sensitive to N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) upon incubation of SMP at 37 °C. Later, it was established that treatment of the deactive form with sulfhydryl reagent completely blocks the turnover-dependent activation of complex I (22Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Gostimskaya I.S. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, the steady-state NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of the active form is entirely insensitive to thiol reagents, suggesting that the A/D transition involves conformational changes of complex I. In the deactive form, specific labeling by thiol reagents of only one subunit with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa has been observed with bovine SMP (24Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This subunit is not labeled in the active form and was reported to be susceptible to modification from the matrix side only in the D-form of the enzyme (23Gostimskaya I.S. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of the cysteine residue selectively accessible only in the D-form of complex I in the loop connecting two transmembrane helices of the mitochondrially encoded ND3 subunit. Implications for the mechanism and the role of the active/deactive transition are discussed. Bovine heart SMP were prepared as described previously (15Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Labeling of the A/D-transition-specific sulfhydryl group was performed as reported previously (24Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. All precipitation and wash steps were performed by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C 60 min 120,000 × g. SMP (1 mg/ml) were suspended at pH 8.0 in SET buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl). 0.4 mm NADPH was added, and the suspension was incubated aerobically with vigorous stirring for 30 min at 23 °C for complex I activation (25Burbaev D.S. Moroz I.A. Kotlyar A.B. Sled V.D. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 47-51Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Activated SMP were washed at pH 8.0 with SET buffer once, resuspended to 10 mg/ml at pH 9.0 in SET buffer, and treated with 30 mm NEM at 15 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 volumes of SET buffer (pH 7.5) containing 35 mm cysteine. After NEM treatment that blocked all thiol groups accessible in the active form of complex I, SMP were precipitated, washed with the same buffer without cysteine, and resuspended in SET buffer (pH 8.0). The SMP suspension was divided into two equal parts that were incubated synchronously for 90 min at 30 °C (deactive) or 4 °C (active). Afterward, both samples were treated with 0.5 mm N-fluoresceinyl maleimide (NFM) for 20 min at 15 °C in the dark. The reaction was terminated by 10-fold dilution with SET buffer (pH 7.5) containing 35 mm cysteine, and the SMP samples were washed twice with SET buffer (pH 8.0). Each sample was resuspended and diluted to a protein concentration of about 20 mg/ml and stored in liquid nitrogen. Although the sample retaining the active form by incubation at 4 °C kept their NADH oxidase or NADH:ubiquinone-1 oxidoreductase activities, the activities of samples that had been deactivated by incubation at elevated temperature before NFM labeling were irreversibly inhibited by 95%. Both preparations catalyzed the non-physiological oxidation of NADH by hexaammineruthenium with the same rates (not shown). The purification of complex I from each sample was carried out by blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) of SMP solubilized by 3 mg/mg of n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside as described previously (26Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The band containing complex I was cut out, and the protein was extracted from the gel by electroelution. This procedure allowed us to obtain around 30–50 μg of the enzyme from 1 mg of SMP protein. Doubled SDS-PAGE (dSDS-PAGE) using 10% acrylamide gel containing 6 m urea for first dimension and 16% acrylamide gel for second dimension Tricine-SDS-PAGE of complex I (in the absence of mercaptoethanol) was performed as described before (27Rais I. Karas M. Schägger H. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2567-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The gels were scanned for fluorescence using 488 nm excitation and 520 nm emission in a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare) after the end of the first run, and the final two-dimensional gels were scanned before and after silver staining. The fluorescent spot and a few neighboring spots were excised, and proteins were digested “in-gel” by trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase essentially as described (28Meyer B. Wittig I. Trifilieff E. Karas M. Schägger H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1690-1699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7818) Google Scholar), except that shrinking by acetonitrile before enzyme digestion was omitted. For mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS, dried samples were dissolved in 5 μl of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl of sample was mixed with 1 μl of matrix (1 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 1 ml of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) and dried on a target plate (Bruker Daltonics). The crystals were washed briefly with ice-cold 5% (v/v) formic acid. MS experiments were performed on an Ultraflex tandem time-of-flight instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The low mass gate was adjusted to 650 Da. The acquisition range was set to 700–5,000 Da. Approximately 3,000 scans were accumulated for each mass spectrum. The obtained resolution was around 15,000 at m/z = 2,000. Using external calibration, mass accuracy was at least 100 ppm. A standard peptide calibration mix (Applied Biosystems, MDS SCIEX) that contained six peptides covering the acquired mass range was used for calibration. Selected peaks were fragmented by the LIFT method to verify Biotools v2.2 calculations with a mass accuracy of 100 ppm for the precursor and 0.6 Da for the fragments. The isolation width for the precursor was adjusted manually (0.5–1% of the precursor mass), and the following fragmentation was laser-induced using ∼15,000 scans. All MS spectra were labeled according to monoisotopic peptide masses using Flex analysis v2.2 software (Bruker Daltonics; Sophisticated Numerical Annotation Procedure (SNAP) algorithm). Signal-to-noise ratios larger than three were used as cut-off values. MS spectra of the chymotrypsin and elastase digests were cleared from background signals, i.e. signals also found in MS spectra of blank gel pieces (listed in supplemental Tables S5 and S7). Using Biotools v2.2 software (Bruker Daltonics), theoretically possible fragments of the presumed protein sequence in the mass range 700–5,000 Da were calculated and automatically compared with the actual mass list. Mass tolerance was set to 100 ppm. Specific modifications of the protein sequence by NEM (molecular mass = 125.048 Da), NEM + H2O (molecular mass = 143.058 Da), NFM (molecular mass = 427.069 Da), N-fluoresceinyl-maleimide + H2O (NFMhyd; molecular mass = 445.08 Da), Mox (oxidized methionine; molecular mass = 15.999 Da), and methanesulfenic acid (molecular mass = 63.998 Da (30Schmidt F. Krah A. Schmid M. Jungblut P.R. Thiede B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 20: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) were considered. Trypsin specificity was defined by C-terminal cleavage of lysine and arginine except if proline was the next amino acid, and the maximum number of missed cleavages was two. Two definitions for C-terminal cleavage by chymotrypsin were used: cleavage following Phe, Trp, and Tyr or following Phe, Trp, Tyr, Leu, Met, Ala, Asp, and Glu (no cleavage if proline was the next amino acid; maximum number of missed cleavages was 20). Limited proteolysis by elastase varied too widely to be useful for calculating MS spectra by Biotools v2.2 software. Therefore, these MS spectra were analyzed manually, i.e. searched for characteristic signals of maleimide-modified fragments. For the analysis of the subsequent MS/MS experiments, a survey of all fragments potentially present in the MS spectra was required. Fragment masses of candidate protein sequences were therefore calculated without defining enzyme specificity and compared with the actual masses in the MS spectra. This approach was also used to search the MS data from chymotrypsin and trypsin cleavage to potentially identify further maleimide-modified peptides following unspecific cleavage. All MS/MS spectra were processed by Flex analysis v2.2 Software (Bruker Daltonics) similar to MS analysis but with further smoothing and baseline correction. Biotools v2.2 software was used to calculate the laser-induced fragmentation of peptide sequences. The predicted fragmentation pattern for a specific peptide corresponding to a signal in the MS spectrum was then compared with the actual MS/MS spectrum. All fine chemicals were from Sigma, and the enzymes were obtained as follows: modified trypsin, sequence grade (Sigma); modified chymotrypsin, sequence grade (Princeton Separations, Inc.); elastase (Roche Applied Science). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) matrix was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonics). Specific labeling of the thiol group involved in the A/D transition was achieved by a two-step procedure (24Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). First, all thiol groups of membrane-bound complex I in the active form were blocked by incubating bovine SMP with large molar excess of NEM. Although the blocking reaction was performed at a moderate temperature of 15 °C, some spontaneous deactivation of the enzyme inevitably occurred during the 1-h procedure necessary to wash and centrifuge, resuspend, and finally incubate the activated SMPs with NEM. Thus, as found previously (15Kotlyar A.B. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), some complex I had already converted back into the deactive form, and the thiol group only accessible in this state of the enzyme became already modified in a fraction of the sample during the blocking reaction. It is important to note, however, that after subsequent conversion of the enzyme into the D-form by incubation at 30 °C, exclusively sulfhydryl groups specifically exposed in this state became labeled with the fluorescent analogue of NEM (NFM). As a control, a portion of the NEM-blocked SMP was kept on ice to stabilize the active state and was also incubated with the fluorescent NEM derivative. Complex I from labeled and control SMP was extracted from the corresponding bands following blue native-PAGE by electroelution (Fig. 1A). 10% Tricine/SDS-PAGE of the concentrated complex I samples revealed a prominent difference in fluorescence between the active and deactive forms in a single band around 15 kDa (Fig. 1B). This observation was in accordance with previously published results (24Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, in the earlier study, it had not been possible to identify the labeled subunit since complex I contains several candidate subunits with apparent masses of around 15 kDa, namely 18-kDa, B18, B17.2, B16.6, ESSS, B17, SGDH, 15-kDa, ND3, B15, B14.7, B14.5a, B14.5b, and B14 (2Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32724-32727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To identify the labeled subunit, we further resolved the subunits of complex I by dSDS-PAGE (27Rais I. Karas M. Schägger H. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2567-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using a second dimension 16% Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2). A single fluorescent spot was observed in the dSDS-gel of the labeled complex I sample from deactivated SMP (Fig. 2D) that was absent in the sample from active SMP (Fig. 2C). Comparison with the silver-stained gels (Fig. 2, B and A) revealed that the fluorescent protein spot was only present in the deactivated sample and was well separated from other proteins. The position of the fluorescent spot (Fig. 2, B and D, spot 1) in dSDS-PAGE above a diagonal of hydrophilic proteins suggested that a highly hydrophobic protein had been labeled (27Rais I. Karas M. Schägger H. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2567-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The corresponding hydrophobic protein without fluorescent label was expected to have a 320 Da lower mass. Indeed, an appropriate spot was found in the silver-stained gels of the active and deactivated samples (Fig. 2, A and B, spot 2). As discussed before, the presence of the second spot in the deactivated sample was expected due to partial modification of the subunit in question by NEM during the blocking procedure because a fraction of the enzyme spontaneously deactivated, making the sulfhydryl group only accessible in this state amenable to chemical modification. We then went on to identify the protein that had been labeled specifically in the deactive form by mass spectrometry. The MALDI-MS spectrum of a tryptic digest of spot 2 revealed a doublet of signals (supplemental Fig. S1A and supplemental Tables S1 and S2) that could be assigned to the NEM-labeled peptide TSPYECGFDPMGSAR of ND3 (methionine-oxidized and not modified). A similar but extended (due to one missed cleavage at arginine) NFM-labeled peptide TSPYECGFDPMGSARLPFSMK of ND3 was revealed by MS analysis of a tryptic digest of spot 1 (supplemental Fig. S1B). However, mass accuracy of the NFM-labeled peptide (120 ppm) just missed the mass tolerance of external calibration (100 ppm), and the available small amounts of peptide were not sufficient for verification of the result by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Moreover, further tryptic fragments were unlikely to be detected because only five potential fragments are in the m/z range 700–5,000 and small peptides are not detectable in MALDI, whereas large peptides are hardly extractable from the 16% acrylamide gels used. Therefore, we tried to verify the involvement of subunit ND3 by using other proteases for limited hydrolysis. We next used chymotrypsin that produces a higher number of fragments with suitable size but cannot be used for common peptide mass fingerprint searches due to the lower specificity of the enzyme. It cleaves preferentially C-terminally at aromatic amino acids Phe, Trp, and Tyr and at a lower rate at amino acids Leu, Met, Ala, Asp, and Glu (32Blow D.M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3. Academic Press, New York1971: 185-212Google Scholar, 33Kamp R.M. Wittmann-Liebold B. Salnikow J. Erdmann V.A. Advanced Methods in Protein Microsequence Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 8-20Google Scholar). Analysis of chymotryptic digests of spots 1 and 2 using the Biotools v2.2 software and setting cleavage at Phe, Trp, and Tyr clearly identified ND3 in both cases (Fig. 3). The peaks with highest signal intensities (Fig. 3, boxed) were identified with a mass accuracy better than 20 ppm (see supplemental Tables S3 and S4) as the NEM- and NFMhyd-(N-fluorescein-5-yl maleimide + H2O) labeled peptides ECGFDPMGSARLPF (1667.8 and 1987.8 Da) and SEKTSPYECGFDPMGSARLPF (2460.1 and 2780.1 Da). The NEM- and NFMhyd-labeled peptides differed by the expected mass of 320.02 Da, and they always appeared as peak pairs with a 16-Da mass shift since methionine was detected unmodified and in the oxidized form. Minor peaks of non-labeled fragments ECGFDPMGSARLPF and SEKTSPYECGFDPMGSARLPF, potentially produced by in-source decay, could also be identified (see supplemental Tables S3 and S4). Further peaks and peak pairs could be assigned to NFMhyd-labeled peptides of ND3 that were either cleaved C-terminally to Leu, Met, Ala, Asp, and Glu (ECGFDPM and SEKTSPYECGFDPM) or cleaved non-specifically on one side of the peptide (Y)SEKTSPYECGFDPMG(S) as summarized in supplemental Table S3. MS/MS analyses of the NEM- and NFMhyd-labeled peptides ECGFDPMGSARLPF and SEKTSPYECGFDPMGSARLPF confirmed the MS results (supplemental Fig. S2). For further verification of subunit ND3 as the fluorescent-labeled protein, spot 1 was digested by elastase cleaving unspecifically at the C terminus of all small hydrophobic amino acids (Ala, Val, Leu, etc.). A signal pair with a 16-Da mass shift was identified in the MS spectrum as NFMhyd-labeled fragment SPYECGFDPMGS (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table S6). Mass accuracy was 15 ppm. The corresponding MS/MS experiment of this fragment revealed a short b-ion series (b5-b8) that could be assigned to the sequence tag GFD (Fig. 4B, inset) and two internal fragments still carrying the NFMhyd label (marked by arrows). The preferential cleavage of the D-P bond is characterized by the high intensity of the b8-ion signal. We conclude that MALDI-MS and MS/MS data unambiguously identified spots 1 and 2 as ND3 subunit labeled specifically at cysteine in position 39 by NFM and NEM, respectively. We have identified the mitochondrially encoded ND3 subunit as the protein that was specifically labeled in the deactive form of complex I by a fluorescent NEM derivative. The modified cysteine was found in position 39 of the ND3 subunit of bovine complex I. In fact, a previous study had suggested that the modified residue should reside close to the lipid bilayer (23Gostimskaya I.S. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The sequence of the ND3 (NuoA/NQO7) subunit is highly conserved in all organisms, but the only highly conserved cysteine is replaced by serine in Escherichia coli and T. thermophilus. Remarkably, the ND3 subunits of complex I from earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris), crickets (Acheta domesticus), and lobster (Hommerus hommerus) do contain this cysteine but are known to show no A/D transitions. It follows that the presence of this residue is not indicative of the capability of complex I to form a deactive form and is not required for the active/deactive transition. However, the fact that it is only labeled in the deactive form clearly indicates that the transition between the two functional states of complex I is associated with conformational changes of or around the ND3 subunit. The specifically labeled cysteine-39 resides in a hydrophilic loop connecting the first two of three predicted transmembrane helices of the ND3 subunit (Fig. 5). Notably, two acidic residues (Glu-38 and Asp-42, Fig. 5) are found nearby, consistent with the observation that the specifically labeled cysteine is unusually alkaline with its apparent pKA shifted to a value of 10.2 (24Gavrikova E.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). According to a recent study, the NEM-modified cysteine residue of deactive complex I was found to be accessible from the matrix side of the membrane (23Gostimskaya I.S. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, the topology of subunit ND3 as predicted by TMPred software based on the “positive inside rule” also places the N terminus of the protein into the intermembrane space so that cysteine-39 in the loop between the first and the second transmembrane helices would in fact reside on the matrix side (Fig. 5). This topology of the ND3 subunit was recently confirmed experimentally for the homologue NuoA from E. coli. 6Cecilia Hägerhall, personal communication. It should be noted, however, that the opposite orientation was proposed for the homologous Nqo7 subunit from P. denitrificans based on heterologously expressed glutathione S-transferase fusions (34Di Bernardo S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochem. 2000; 39: 9411-9418Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although this has to be kept in mind, it seems likely that the cysteine-containing loop resides on the matrix side of the membrane. This would place it at the interface to the peripheral arm of complex I as the ND3 subunit could be cross-linked to the PSST subunit (35Kao M.C. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Subunit PSST is the central subunit binding the terminal iron-sulfur cluster N2 that acts as the immediate electron donor to ubiquinone (11Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies on the orientation of the peripheral arm relative to the membrane arm (36Clason T. Zickermann V. Ruiz T. Brandt U. Radermacher M. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 159: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggest that the cysteine-39 loop of the ND3 subunit is part of the structure connecting the peripheral and the membrane arm of complex I. Chemical modification of cysteine-39 of the ND3 subunit prevents transition into the active form and thereby effectively inhibits complex I activity. This suggests that the region around the matrix loop of the ND3 subunit is critically involved in functionally relevant conformational changes occurring during the catalytic turnover of complex I. This notion gains further support from the fact that pathogenic mutations were reported in three positions of the loop upstream and downstream of Cys-39 (Fig. 5). Mutations S34P (Thr-34 in Bos taurus), S45P (Gly-45 in B. taurus), and A47T cause Leigh syndrome with or without dystonia or progressive mitochondrial disease (37Sarzi E. Brown M.D. Lebon S.

Taylor R.W. Thorburn D.R. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 55: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Also, basal ganglia lesions associated with complex I deficiency were recently found in patients with heteroplasmic A47T mutations (40Chae J.H. Lee J.S. Kim K.J. Hwang Y.S. Bonilla E. Tanji K. Hirano M. Pediatr. Res. 2007; 61: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Irreversible inhibitory S-nitrosation of the D-form has been demonstrated recently in vitro. This mechanism may be relevant in vivo under pathological conditions when the turnover of the enzyme is limited during hypoxia or when the nitric oxide:oxygen ratio increases (41Galkin A. Moncada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37748-37753Google Scholar) and may suggest a regulatory role of the ND3 subunit. As a central subunit, the ND3 protein is present in complex I from all sources, but so far the A/D transition has only been observed with eukaryotic complex I that contains a large number of accessory subunits not present in the bacterial enzyme (20Maklashina E. Kotlyar A.B. Cecchini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, although it seems clear that conformational changes around the cysteine-39 loop of the ND3 subunit play a critical role in the A/D transition, one or several of these accessory subunits may well be involved in exerting or controlling these conformational changes of complex I.

Nevertheless, these two cellular responses are mutually exclusive. To solve this apparent contradiction, we studied the behavior of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in response to increasing concentrations of PDGF. We found that there is strong cell proliferation induction only with PDGF concentrations >5 ng/ml, whereas the cell migration response arises starting from 1 ng/ml and is negligible at higher PDGF concentrations. According to these phenotypic evidences, our data indicate that cells display a differential activation of the main signaling pathways in response to PDGF as a function of the stimulation dose. At low PDGF concentrations, there is maximal activation of signaling pathways linked to cytoskeleton rearrangement needed for cell motility, whereas high PDGF concentrations activate pathways linked to mitogenesis induction. Our results suggest a mechanism by which cells switch from a migrating to a proliferating phenotype sensing the increasing gradient of PDGF. In addition, we propose that the cell decision to proliferate or migrate relies on different endocytotic routes of the PDGF receptor in response to different PDGF concentrations.

PDGF exerts its multifaceted functions by binding to the PDGF receptor (PDGFR), which dimerizes, activates its intrinsic catalytic activity, and undergoes autophosphorylation on >10 specific tyrosines that serve as docking sites for intracellular signaling molecules harboring the SH2 (Src homology 2) or protein tyrosine-binding domain (3Heldin C.H.

It has been largely reported that the activation of these multiple pathways leads ultimately to various kinds of cellular responses (i.e. cell proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation) (4Tallquist M. Kazlauskas A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Pennock S.D. Chen X. Kazlauskas A. Wang Z. J. Biol.

Cancer. 2001; 91: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this work, we studied the mechanism by which PDGF signaling, transduced by the same intracellular molecules, on the same cell type (mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts) is able to induce two radically different phenotypic outputs: migration and proliferation. What is the molecular basis of the cell decision to proliferate or to migrate sensing the same kind of stimulus? Our working hypothesis is that any single cell chooses to proliferate or migrate depending on the PDGF concentration in the environment. There are many physiologic and pathologic situations in which a growth factor gradient can be formed, e.g. during development, wound healing, and angiogenesis, as well as in cancer growth. In such conditions, target cells more distant from the gradient source sense a relatively low PDGF concentration, and their phenotypic response consists of directional cell migration along the gradient. When migrating cells arrive at a point at which the PDGF concentration reaches a precise threshold, they switch from a migrating phenotype to a proliferating one, leading, in the case of wound healing, to efficient tissue repair. Our experimental results essentially confirm this model. Moreover, we propose that differential routes of PDGFR endocytosis as a function of PDGF concentrations play a fundamental role in determining the cellular phenotypic output. Low PDGF doses induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which is not sufficient per se to elicit cell proliferation. In this condition, PDGFR remains prevalently on the cell surface, acting essentially as a sensor. At high PDGF concentrations, PDGFR internalization shifts, at least partially, toward a different kind of mechanism: raft/caveolin-mediated endocytosis (RME). In the latter case, PDGFR is able to start the mitotic process and then undergoes proteasomal degradation. Materials—Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma.

RNA interference oligonucleotides for dynamin-2 were from Qiagen Inc. Cell Culture—NIH3T3 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Crystal Violet Staining—2 × 104 NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 24-multiwell plates and serum-starved for 24 h before receiving the reported dose of PDGF for 24 and 48 h. Fresh growth factor was added daily. Cell growth was stopped by removing the medium and adding a 0.5% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol. After 5 min of staining, the fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.2 (200 μl/well). The absorbance at 595 nm was evaluated using a microplate reader. Biochemical Analysis—1 × 106 cells were seeded onto 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before receiving PDGF. Pharmacologic inhibitors (12.5 mg/ml nystatin plus 0.25 mg/ml filipin) were added to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C before stimulation. Cells were then lysed for 20 min on ice in 0.5 ml of complete radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with 0.1 μg of the specific antibodies. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Immunoblots were incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature; probed first with specific antibodies and then with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase; washed; and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Chemiluminescence was detected using the Gel Logic 2200 imaging system (Eastman Kodak Co.). Kodak MI software was used to perform the quantitative analysis of the spots. Rho and Rac pulldown assays were performed by treating the cells as described above. In complete RIPA buffer, cell lysates were added to 10 μl of rhotekin Rho-binding domain-agarose (Rho) or PAK-CRIB-GST-agarose (Rac). Samples was kept for 1 h at 4 °C, washed twice with 1 ml of complete RIPA buffer, denatured with 15 μl of SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine. The target sequences in the mouse dynamin-2 gene were CTGCCTCTGTATATCCTATTA and CTGGCTCAAGTTGTATATATA. Control siRNA had three mutations in the sequence of dynamin-2 siRNA. Cells were used for the experiments after 3 days of transfection. Two-dimensional Migration and Proliferation Assay of Adherent Cells in Culture—Two-dimensional lateral sheet migration and proliferation of adherent cells in culture were evaluated using a silicon template fencing technique as reported previously (7Parenti A. Donnini S. Morbidelli L. Granger H.J. Ziche M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 119: 619-621Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 10% bovine calf serum were seeded onto a rectangular silicon gasket inserted inside the wells of 6-well cell culture dishes and allowed to reach confluence. The gasket was then removed; confluent cell monolayers were washed with medium; and the four edges of the rectangular cell monolayer were marked with a scalpel on the outside of the tissue culture dish to define the starting line of cell progression. PDGF (in 0% bovine calf serum medium) was added, and the experiment was stopped after 24 h. Cell migration was quantified by (a) measuring microscopically the distance of migrated cells from the starting lines to the migration front (the farthest cells) with the aid of an ocular grid (225 × 225 μm = 1 grid unit) and (b) counting the total number of cells in each grid unit according to the method described elsewhere (7Parenti A. Donnini S. Morbidelli L. Granger H.J. Ziche M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 119: 619-621Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PDGFR Internalization Assay—PDGFR internalization was determined according to Roberts et al. (8Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then labeled with 0.2 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min on ice. Cell were incubated for 10 min on ice with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl to quench the unbound biotin. Cell were prewarmed at 37 °C for 5 min and then stimulated with 2 or 30 ng/ml PDGF for the indicated times. Biotin was removed from proteins remaining at the cell surface by incubation with a solution of 20 mm sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, and 100 mm NaCl for 2 min on ice. Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate was inactivated by adding a solution of 20 mm iodoacetic acid in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min on ice, and the cells were then lysed as described above. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the biotinylated proteins of the supernatant were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose resin. Cytofluorometric Analysis—105 NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes, and after 24 h of starvation, they were stimulated with 0, 1, 5, or 30 ng/ml PDGF. After 19 h, cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.6 ml of 50 mg/liter propidium iodide hypotonic solution. Sample analysis was performed in a BD Biosciences FACSCanto using FACSDiva and ModFit cell analysis software. Data Analysis—The results shown are from at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. PDGF Dose-dependent Phenotypic Response of NIH3T3 Cells—The time course of PDGFR phosphorylation in cells stimulated with 30 ng/ml PDGF (Fig. 1) reached a maximum after 10 min and rapidly declined thereafter. The time course of PDGFR phosphorylation at both 5 and 1 ng/ml was lower, as expected, compared with 30 ng/ml PDGF, but interestingly, the phosphorylation signal was more persistent (Fig. 1). The proliferative effect of PDGF concentrations on NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A) was a function of stimulation dose. In particular, cytofluorometric analysis of cells after 19 h of stimulation (Fig. 2B) with various PDGF concentrations demonstrated that doses <2 ng/ml did not elicit S phase cell entry, whereas at concentrations >5 ng/ml, cells entered S phase proportionally to the stimulation dose.FIGURE 2Dose-dependent PDGF-induced cell growth. A, analysis of cell growth rate. 5 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 10-mm dishes and stimulated with the indicated PDGF concentrations 24 h after starvation. After 24 and 48 h of stimulation, the cells were fixed with 0.5% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol. Cell growth was evaluated by measuring absorbance at 595 nm as described under “Materials and Methods.” n = 5 in duplicate. **, p < 0.001 versus 1 ng/ml PDGF. B, cytofluorometric analysis. 5 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 10-mm dishes and stimulated with the indicated PDGF concentrations 24 h after starvation. After 19 h, cells were lysed in 1 ml of propidium iodide solution and analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the dose-dependent effect of PDGF on NIH3T3 cell migration. First, we used a wound healing assay (Fig. 3A), which demonstrated that low doses of PDGF (1 or 2 ng/ml), at which there was no cell proliferation (Fig. 2B), caused migration, whereas higher doses of PDGF (5 or 30 ng/ml) showed a repair of the “wound” that was probably due to both cell proliferation and migration. To better dissect this aspect, we quantified the cell migration both by measuring microscopically the distance of the migrated cells from the starting lines to the migration front and by counting the total number of cells in each grid unit (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 3 (A and B) shows that 1 ng/ml PDGF was better able to induce cell migration compared with higher doses considering the cell number in the function of the distance traveled. In conclusion, low PDGF concentrations (1–2 ng/ml) are able to induce cell migration but not cell proliferation, whereas at high PDGF doses (5–30 ng/ml), cell proliferation induction prevails. Hence, increasing PDGF doses are able to induce a progressive shift from the migrating to proliferating phenotype in NIH3T3 cells. PDGF Dose-dependent Differential Activation of Intracellular Signaling Pathways—PDGFR phosphorylation increases fairly linearly with PDGF dose stimulation (see Fig. 1), but the changes in phenotypic outcome are not linear at all. In fact, we observed a drastic change in the cellular program as a function of PDGF concentration. We chose to study the dose-dependent intracellular signaling of PDGF, focusing in particular on pathways such as those initiated by PI3K and Ras activation as prototypes of proliferating and anti-apoptotic mediators of PDGF stimulation and by Rho, Rac, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation as prototypes of pathways involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. Ras/ERK cascade activation due to growth factor receptor stimulation is one of the most important signaling pathways promoting cellular division (9Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 10Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent activation of ERKs (Fig. 4A), as expected, paralleled that of PDGFR phosphorylation according to the fact that a pathway heavily involved in cell cycle progression is more active at high PDGF concentrations (5 and 30 ng/ml), at which we observed a strong mitosis induction. The other mitosis-related pathway that we examined was PI3K/Akt (Fig. 4B). PI3K activation has a major role in activating growth factor-stimulated cell cycle progression (11Collado M. Medema R.H. Garcia-Cao I. Dubuisson M.L. Barradas M. Glassford J. Rivas C. Burgering B.M. Serrano M. Lam E.W. J. Biol.

Beniston R. Franssen E. Slingerland J.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the dose-dependent activation of PI3K/Akt was not superimposable on that of PDGFR activation (Fig. 1A). In fact, the Akt phosphorylation level began to increase at a 1–2 ng/ml PDGF stimulation dose, at which there was no proliferation induction. One possible explanation may be that Akt activation is important not only in cell proliferation but also serves in anti-apoptotic signaling (15Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar), and hence, this pathway needs to be active also when cells are not proliferating (i.e. low PDGF concentration). FAK is a tyrosine kinase (16Ilić D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T.

PDGF dose-dependent activation of FAK (Fig. 5A) is very different from PDGFR phosphorylation. In fact, maximal FAK phosphorylation was reached at 1–2 ng/ml PDGF stimulation, at which PDGFR phosphorylation was very low, consistent with the evidence that NIH3T3 migration is greater at low PDGF doses. Rho and Rac belong to the Rho family of small GTPases, and both play a key role in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton related to directional cell migration (20Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 265: 23-32Crossref Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 21Yamazaki D. Kurisu S. Takenawa T. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 22Fukata M. Nakagawa M.

Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Once activated, these small G proteins are able to recruit intracellular effectors that induce cellular responses, such as protrusion of filopodia (Rac) or lamellipodia (Cdc42) at the leading edge of the cells or events linked to myosin-mediated contractility (Rho), which helps in the retraction of the trailing edge. Rho and Rac activation as a function of PDGF dose stimulation showed a maximum at 1–2 and 0.25–1 ng/ml, respectively. Once again, the time course of Rho/Rac activation did not follow that of PDGFR, in keeping with the evidence that only low PDGF doses are able to induce cell migration (Fig. 5, B and C). To confirm the role of Rho and Rac activation in low dose PDGF-BB-induced cell migration, we performed the wound healing assay in the presence of both the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 (26Désiré L.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 325: 273-284Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 6 show that both Rac1 and ROCK inhibitors were able to reduce PDGF-induced migration. In conclusion, low PDGF concentrations (<5 ng/ml) induce cell migration through the activation of pathways such as Rho, Rac, and FAK devoted to cytoskeleton rearrangement, whereas proliferative pathways such as Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt are not significantly activated. On the other hand, high PDGF concentrations (>5 ng/ml) are essentially pro-mitotic, and consequently, Rho, Rac, and FAK are down-regulated, whereas pathways involved in cell cycle progression are highly stimulated. PDGF Dose-dependent PDGFR Endocytotic Route—What is the mechanism through which PDGF concentration can determine the cell decision to proliferate or migrate? The answer could reside either in a “qualitative” difference of the single PDGFR molecule depending on the dose of ligand or in a “quantitative” difference. In the first hypothesis, a low dose of PDGF elicits the phosphorylation of a subset of PDGFR tyrosines different from those induced by a high dose of PDGF. This qualitative difference at the level of PDGFR could explain the activation of distinct pathways and hence the different phenotypic outputs. In the second hypothesis, the tyrosines that are phosphorylated in response to PDGFR stimulation are the same irrespective of the PDGF concentration, so the different cellular behavior as a function of the stimulation dose resides in the number of the activated receptors. To verify the qualitative hypothesis, we analyzed the PDGF dose-dependent activation of five PDGFR tyrosines that recruit important downstream signaling molecules such as PI3K (Tyr740), Src (Tyr579), Grb2 (Tyr716), phospholipase γ1 (Tyr1021), and Tyr857, which are involved in PDGF kinase activation (3Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). The results show that there were no differences in the phosphorylation of these tyrosines as a function of PDGF concentration (Fig. 7), ruling out the possibility that the differential activation of downstream pathways relies on the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern. One of the consequences of PDGFR activation is its internalization. Fig. 8 shows that high PDGF concentrations led to a higher PDGFR internalization rate than low doses. This is a quantitative difference because it does not depend on the state of the single PDGFR molecule but on the different number of activated receptors. This result is in agreement with Fig. 1, which shows an ∼80% down-regulation of PDGFR expression 1 h after stimulation with 30 ng/ml PDGF, whereas we did not observe a similar effect at low dose stimulation. In fact, to undergo proteasomal/lysosomal degradation, PDGFR has to be internalized (30Sorkin A. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 31Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4917-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and high PDGF doses were able to induce a higher PDGFR internalization rate than low doses (Fig. 8). Recently, Sigismund et al. (33Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at a low ligand dose follows exclusively a CME pathway, whereas at a high ligand dose, EGFR internalization proceeds also through RME. To study the relevance of these two kinds of endocytotic routes at high and low PDGF doses and their relative effects on NIH3T3 cellular behavior, we used two drugs, filipin (0.25 μg/ml) and nystatin (12.5 μg/ml), which preferentially interfere with non-CME-type internalization (33Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 34Pelkmans L.

Püntener D. Helenius A. Science. 2002; 296: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In the latter case, we obtained a 50–60% expression reduction 3 days after transfection with respect to NIH3T3 cells treated with unrelated siRNA (data not shown). Fig. 9A shows that, in cells stimulated with low PDGF concentrations, the treatment with dynamin-2 siRNA strongly inhibited PDGF-induced wound repair, suggesting a key role of CME in cell migration. Interestingly, cells treated with RME inhibitors induced increased cell migration compared with control cells, suggesting that inhibiting RME could redirect PDGFR to other endocytotic routes (i.e. CME) that are linked to cell-related migration signaling.FIGURE 9A, wound healing assay performed on dynamin-2 siRNA-transfected or filipin/nystatin-treated NIH3T3 cells. 24 h after starvation, a wound was produced on the cell layer using a pipette tip. The cells were then stimulated with 2 ng/ml PDGF. 24 h after wounding, the migrated cells in the grid area were counted. The mean migrated cell number ± S.E. was calculated from at least 15 randomly chosen optical fields. The results are representative of three independent experiments. *, p < 0.005 versus 2 ng/ml PDGF.

After 24 h, cell proliferation was assessed as described under”Materials and Methods.“*, p < 0.005 versus 30 ng/ml PDGF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a second set of experiments, we measured cell proliferation at high PDGF concentrations in cells treated with filipin/nystatin and/or dynamin-2 siRNA. Fig. 9B shows that the inhibition of RME led to a significant inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas NIH3T3 cells treated with dynamin-2 siRNA (hence inhibiting CME) showed a great increase in cell proliferation compared with control cells. These data indicate that RME is important for PDGF mitogenesis induction and that the proliferative effect of CME inhibition could be due to the redirection of PDGFR molecules to the pro-proliferative RME pathway. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that NIH3T3 cells treated with both dynamin-2 siRNA and RME inhibitors behaved similarly to the control cells, pointing to RME as responsible for the “extra” proliferation of dynamin-2 siRNA-transfected cells. PDGFR is a transmembrane receptor whose activation play an essential role in promoting and controlling many aspects of cell physiology such as mitosis, migration, and metabolism, as well as differentiation. In particular, two of these cellular responses, proliferation and migration, appear to be mutually exclusive for an individual cell at a given time. To clarify this apparent contradiction, we developed a very simple model in which the phenotypic output of a given cell depends essentially on the concentration of PDGF. First, we studied the ligand dose and the time and dose-dependent activation of PDGFR (Fig. 1) in relation to the phenotypic outcome induced in NIH3T3 cells. Our results show that, although PDGFR phosphorylation increases almost linearly as a function of the PDGF dose, the cellular response is not linear at all. Low PDGF concentrations (<2 ng/ml) were totally unable to induce cell proliferation (Fig. 2) but were more efficient in promoting cell migration than the higher doses both in wound healing experiments (Fig. 3A) and in the two-dimensional migration and proliferation assay tests (Fig. 3, B and C). Conversely, a high PDGF concentration (30 ng/ml) was able to induce a strong proliferating stimulus (Fig. 2) but had a minor effect on promoting cell migration compared with the lower doses (Fig. 3). The transition between these two cellular phenotypic responses takes place without solution of continuity being, for example, 5 ng/ml PDGF able to induce both mitogenesis and migration. A likely explanation of this effect would be that, in these conditions, two different subsets of the cell population make different behavioral decisions. Next, we analyzed some intracellular signaling pathways triggered by PDGFR activation. We found that of the two pathways linked with cell cycle progression examined, one, ERK (Fig. 4A), follows the same dose-dependent activation as PDGFR itself, whereas the other, PI3K/Akt (Fig. 4B), begins to be detectably active even at low doses (2–5 ng/ml). An explanation of this phenomenon may reside in the fact that not only Akt is involved in mitosis, but its activation is mandatory for cell survival, and hence its effects must be present also at low PDGF concentrations. We then examined three downstream PDGFR mediators that are strictly linked with cytoskeleton remodeling during cell migration: FAK, Rho, and Rac1 (Figs. 5, A–C; and 6). The activation of these three proteins is marked at low PDGF concentrations (in conditions permissive for cell migration), whereas at high PDGF concentrations, at which mitogenic signaling prevails, their functional activation is lowered. At this point, it is clear that PDGFR induces different and, for many aspects, opposite cellular responses through differential activation of intracellular signaling pathways, sensing the environmental concentration of its ligand. To explain this outcome, we developed two hypotheses. The qualitative hypothesis states that PDGFR phosphorylation is differentially stimulated by different PDGF doses, activating different subsets of signaling pathways. The quantitative hypothesis predicts that PDGFR activation is an all-or-none phenomenon so that every individual dimer of activated receptor is phosphorylated in the same way (i.e. has an identical tyrosine phosphorylation pattern) irrespective of the environmental ligand concentration. In the latter case, the PDGF dose simply influences the number of activated receptors. Our data rule out the first hypothesis because we could not measure a differential phosphorylation state of the five diverse PDGFR tyrosines as a function of ligand concentration (Fig. 7). One of the consequences of activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is their internalization. Not only is this event linked to their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, but it is well established that endosomal receptor tyrosine kinases play an important role in signal transduction (35Miaczynska M. Pelkmans L. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 36Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 897-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In particular, regarding PDGFR, Wang et al. (5Wang Y. Pennock S.D. Chen X. Kazlauskas A. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8038-8046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showed that endosomal PDGFR signaling is sufficient to activate the major signaling pathways that allow cell proliferation. Herein, we confirmed that it is not only sufficient but also necessary. First, we assessed that the PDGFR internalization rate depends on the concentration of the ligand (Fig. 8). PDGF at 30 ng/ml induces much more PDGFR endocytosis compared with 1 or 5 ng/ml. Sigismund et al. (33Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) observed that EGFR endocytosis proceeds through two different pathways: at low ligand stimulation doses, EGFR internalization depends exclusively on the CME pathway, whereas at high doses, EGFR endocytosis proceeds also through RME. We interfered with both CME (lowering the dynamin-2 expression level) and RME (using two pharmacologic inhibitors, filipin and nystatin) and studied the cellular behavior at low and high PDGF doses. Our data suggest that there is a balance (which depends on ligand concentrations) between these two kind of PDGF endocytotic routes that determines the cellular response. In fact, we found that, at low PDGF concentrations, which are exclusively permissive for cell migration, CME does play a functional role in this phenomenon because in cells in which dynamin-2 was silenced, cell migration was inhibited (Fig. 9A). Interestingly, cells treated with filipin and nystatin showed a significant increase in cell migration, supporting the idea that, in the presence of RME inhibition, PDGFR CME is strengthen, thus leading to higher cell motility. On the other hand, at high PDGF concentrations, at which cell proliferation is the prevalent effect, RME inhibition led to a corresponding inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 9B), indicating that RME represents a signal transduction pathway that is essential for PDGFR-mediated mitogenesis. Consequently, RME-dependent PDGFR degradation represents merely a consequence and not the aim of the RME route. In addition, in cells stimulated with high PDGF concentrations, inhibition of CME in dynamin siRNA-treated cells led to a great increase in cell proliferation compared with control cells (Fig. 9B). Similar to what was discussed above, the inhibition of CME could induce a shift in the PDGFR internalization route toward RME, thus leading to a stronger proliferative response compared with control cells. This “balance and shift” hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that dynamin-2 siRNA-transfected cells treated with filipin/nystatin show a proliferation response similar to control cell, indicating that RME is responsible for the extra proliferative signaling of CME-inhibited cells. In conclusion, PDGFR appears to have two distinct functions depending on the environmental ligand concentration. Similar to EGF (33Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), low PDGF doses induced exclusively CME that was strongly involved in cell migration but was not essential for cell proliferation (Fig. 9A). Under these conditions, PDGFR acts like a sensor on the cell surface guiding cell migration, and CME could play an essential role in regenerating free PDGFR on the surface that is needed to sense the PDGF gradient. Notably, low PDGF doses did not lead, at least within 1 h, to appreciable PDGFR down-regulation (Fig. 1), which was instead very high when cells were stimulated with high doses, strengthening the hypothesis of a sensor-like function for PDGFR in these conditions. At high PDGF doses, PDGFR internalization is mediated also by RME, and this endocytic route is not only sufficient (5Wang Y. Pennock S.D. Chen X. Kazlauskas A. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8038-8046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) but also necessary for PDGF-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 9A). Therefore, we propose that the dual “face” of PDGFR signaling depends on the environmental concentration of PDGF sensed by each target cell. Low PDGF concentrations are able to induce directional migration toward the ligand source. When the cell, migrating along the increasing gradient, finds the minimal PDGF concentration that is sufficient to induce proliferation, it stops moving and enters mitosis. This model can be easily applied to a variety of physiologic and pathologic situations such as wound healing, angiogenesis, and metastasis and can likely be extended to describe the behavior of many other receptor tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2081895505,"Heterotropic association of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) with extracellular matrix-associated fibronectin (FN) can restore the adhesion of fibroblasts when the integrin-mediated direct binding to FN is impaired using RGD-containing peptide. We demonstrate that the compensatory effect of the TG-FN complex in the presence of RGD-containing peptides is mediated by TG2 binding to the heparan sulfate chains of the syndecan-4 cell surface receptor. This binding mediates activation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and its subsequent interaction with β<sub>1</sub> integrin since disruption of PKCα binding to β<sub>1</sub> integrins with a cell-permeant competitive peptide inhibits cell adhesion and the associated actin stress fiber formation. Cell signaling by this process leads to the activation of focal adhesion kinase and ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Fibroblasts deficient in Raf-1 do not respond fully to the TG-FN complex unless either the full-length kinase competent Raf-1 or the kinase-inactive domain of Raf-1 is reintroduced, indicating the involvement of the Raf-1 protein in the signaling mechanism. We propose a model for a novel RGD-independent cell adhesion process that could be important during tissue injury and/or remodeling whereby TG-FN binding to syndecan-4 activates PKCα leading to its association with β<sub>1</sub> integrin, reinforcement of actin-stress fiber organization, and MAPK pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W2119097555,"A series of small compounds acting at the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR92 were screened using a signaling pathway-specific reporter assay system. Lipid-derived molecules including farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), N-arachidonylglycine (NAG), and lysophosphatidic acid were found to activate GPR92. FPP and lysophosphatidic acid were able to activate both Gq/11- and Gs-mediated signaling pathways, whereas NAG activated only the Gq/11-mediated signaling pathway. Computer-simulated modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis of GPR92 indicated that Thr97, Gly98, Phe101, and Arg267 of GPR92 are responsible for the interaction of GPR92 with FPP and NAG. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that GPR92 mRNA is highly expressed in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) but faint in other brain regions. Peripheral tissues including, spleen, stomach, small intestine, and kidney also expressed GPR92 mRNA. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GPR92 is largely co-localized with TRPV1, a nonspecific cation channel that responds to noxious heat, in mouse and human DRG. FPP and NAG increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in cultured DRG neurons. These results suggest that FPP and NAG play a role in the sensory nervous system through activation of GPR92.

Many members of this superfamily are major targets of pharmaceutical drugs (1Wilson S. Bergsma D. Drug. Des. Discov. 2000; 17: 105-114PubMed Google Scholar). Completion of the human genome project revealed the structures of many novel GPCRs for which the natural ligands remain to be identified, so-called orphan GPCRs. Because identification of the ligands for orphan GPCRs is important for understanding the physiological roles of these receptors and promises a rich source of potential drug candidates, efforts have been made to identify the ligands of these receptors (2Civelli O. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Wise A. Jupe S.C. Rees S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Cytol. 2006; 252: 163-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The human GPR92 (also known as GPR93) gene was first discovered by customized GenBank™ searches (5Lee D.K. Nguyen T. Lynch K.R. Cheng R. Vanti W.B. Arkhitko O. Lewis T. Evans J.F. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is located on chromosome 12, region p 13.31 and contains two noncoding and coding exons encoding 372 amino acid residues (6Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). GPR92 belongs to the rhodopsin-like GPCR family and is structurally related to GPR23/LPA4 receptor, an atypical lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor that shares only 20-24% amino acid identity with conventional LPA receptors (LPA1-3) (7Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). This structural relationship led to an identification of LPA as a GPR92 ligand (6Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 8Kotarsky K. Boketoft A. Bristulf J. Nilsson N.E. Norberg A. Hansson S. Owman C. Sillard R. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Olde B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). LPA increased cAMP levels and inositol phosphate (IP) production and induced intracellular calcium mobilization in cells expressing GPR92. This indicates that GPR92 is likely coupled to Gs and Gq/11. Further LPA-induced neurite retraction and stress fiber formation in GPR92-expressing cells suggests that GPR92 is also coupled to G12/13 (6Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar).This LPA responsiveness of GPR92 along with its structural similarity to LPA4 led to the suggestion that this receptor be renamed the LPA5 receptor (6Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that GPR92 has only a 35% amino acid homology with the LPA4 receptor. Additionally EC50 values for various LPA compounds in the production of cAMP and IP in GPR92-expressing cells range between 0.5 and 5 μm. This indicates that LPA is a moderately potent activator of GPR92 (6Lee C.W. Rivera R. Gardell S. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 8Kotarsky K. Boketoft A. Bristulf J. Nilsson N.E. Norberg A. Hansson S. Owman C. Sillard R. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Olde B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). More recently, a luminal protein hydrolysate was found to activate GPR92 and possess a higher potency for cAMP production than LPA (9Choi S. Lee M. Shiu A.L. Yo S.J. Hallden G. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: G1366-G1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possibility that molecules other than LPA can serve as ligands for GPR92 and that perhaps reference to this compound as the LPA5 receptor would be premature.While searching for orphan GPCR ligands using various chemical compounds, we found that many lipid-derived molecules are able to activate GPR92 with different potencies. Of these, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) was more potent than LPA in activating GPR92 as revealed by Emax and EC50 values. N-Arachidonylglycine (NAG) was as potent as LPA in activation of GPR92. FPP and LPA activated both Gs- and Gq/11-linked signaling pathways, whereas NAG was able to activate only the Gq/11-linked signaling pathway. Using computer-simulated molecular modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues responsible for the interaction of GPR92 with FPP and NAG. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that GPR92 mRNA was present in high levels in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in the nervous system as well as in the spleen, stomach, intestine, and kidney. Further FPP and NAG induced Ca2+ mobilization in cultured DRG cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—The chemicals 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and FPP were purchased from Sigma. U73122 and MDL-12330A were obtained from Calbiochem. We obtained 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). LPA (14:0) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All acylamides, including NAG, N-arachidonyl γ-aminobutyric acid, N-palmitoylserine phosphoric acid, N-arachidonylalanine, and N-arachidonylserine, were synthesized as described previously (10Huang S.M.

Site-directed mutagenesis of human GPR92 was generated by the PCR overlapping extension method (11Acharjee S. Do-Rego J.L. Oh D.Y. Ahn R.S. Choe H. Vaudry H. Kim K. Seong J.Y. Kwon H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54445-54453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All PCR-derived sequences were verified by automatic sequencing. pCMV β-Gal was purchased from Clontech. SRE-luc, containing a single copy of the serum response element (SRE; CCATATTAGG) followed by a c-fos basic promoter and luciferase, was constructed. Adenoviruses containing human GPR92 or an SRE-luc reporter were obtained from Neugex Co. (Seoul, Korea).Adenovirus Infection, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Adenovirus infection and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (4Oh D.Y. Kim K. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2006; 252: 163-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were maintained in DMEM in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (5 × 103) were plated into a 96-well plate. Cells were coinfected with adenoviruses containing human GPR92 and an SRE-luc reporter with 50 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) under serum-free conditions for 3 h. Cells were then incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM.For SRE-luc analysis, cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM for at least 16 h before treatment. Following treatment of cells with an agonist for 6 h, cells were harvested. Luciferase activity in the cell extracts was determined according to standard methods using a Wallac 1420 VICTOR3 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For transfection of GPR92 mutants, CV-1 cells were plated into 24-well plates and transfected 24 h later with Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The total amount of DNA used in each transfection was adjusted to 1 μg by adding appropriate amounts of pcDNA3. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with ligands for 6 h.GTPγS Binding Assay—Forty-eight hours after infection of CV-1 cells with adenoviruses containing human GPR92 or vehicle, cells were homogenized in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4) and stored at -80 °C until use. Agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was determined as described previously (12Fumagalli M. Trincavelli L. Lecca D. Martini C. Ciana P. Abbracchio M.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly membrane fractions (15 μg) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 3 μm GDP) in the presence of various concentrations of FPP, LPA, or NAG. [35S]GTPγS (0.2 nm) was added. Then samples were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The incubation was stopped by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Bound GTPγ[35S] was counted in a scintillation mixture. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm GTPγS to be less than 10% of total binding.Measurement of Inositol Phosphate Production—An IP production assay was performed as described previously (13Oh D.Y.

CV-1 cells were seeded into a 12-well plate and infected with adenoviruses containing human GPR92 with 100 m.o.i. After infection, cells were incubated in M199 medium (Invitrogen) in the presence of 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences)/well for 20 h. Medium was removed, and cells were washed with 0.5 ml Buffer A (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 4 mm KCl, 8 mm d-glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin). Cells were then preincubated for 30 min with Buffer A containing 10 mm LiCl followed by addition of 1 μm FPP, 10 μm NAG, or 10 μm LPA at 37 °C for 30 min with or without 15-min prior treatment with a phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122. Replacing incubation medium with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm formic acid terminated the reaction. After 30 min at 4 °C, the formic acid extracts were transferred to columns containing Dowex anion-exchange resin (AG-1-X8 resin, Bio-Rad). Total IPs were then eluted with 1 ml of ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid. Radioactivity was determined using a Tri-Carb 3100TR scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).cAMP Assay—Cyclic AMP levels were determined by measuring [3H]cAMP formation from [3H]ATP (13Oh D.Y. Song J.A. Moon J.S. Moon M.J. Kim J.I. Kim K. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours before transfection, HeLa cells were seeded into 12-well plates. Cells were transfected with the pcDNA3-GPR92 plasmid with Effectene reagent. One day later, cells were labeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h. Cells were first washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. Cells were stimulated with 1 μm FPP, 10 μm NAG, or 10 μm LPA for 30 min with or without 15-min prior treatment with an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, MDL-12330A. The reactions were terminated by replacing the medium with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm cAMP. [3H]cAMP and [3H]ATP were separated on AG 50W-X4 resin (Bio-Rad) and alumina columns as described previously (13Oh D.Y. Song J.A. Moon J.S. Moon M.J. Kim J.I. Kim K. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cAMP accumulation was expressed as [3H]cAMP/([3H]ATP + [3H]cAMP) × 1000.Ca2+ Mobilization Assay—F11 rat embryonic neuroblastoma × DRG neuron hybrid cells (generous gifts from Dr. Henning Otto, Freie Universität, Berlin, Germany) were transiently transfected with hGPR92-GFP and grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 24-48 h. Cells were then incubated in a physiological solution (138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) with 5 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 45 min. Cells were washed twice with the dye-free physiological solution and mounted in an acrylamide chamber that allows for perfusion of incubation medium. Fura-2/AM fluorescence was measured in GFP-positive cells at excitation wavelengths 340 and 380 nm and at emission wavelength 510 nm using an IX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) coupled to a digital cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP fx CCD camera, Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ).ERK Activation—CV-1 cells (2 × 105) were plated on a 60-mm dish for 1 day before infection with adenoviruses containing GPR92. Cells were infected with 100 m.o.i. adenoviruses for 3 h in serum-free DMEM. Then the medium was changed to 10% fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM. Before protein preparation for ERK Western blotting, cells were incubated for at least 16 h in serum-free medium prior to agonist stimulation. After agonist stimulation in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin, cells were lysed by RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) followed by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of cellular extracts were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 were detected by immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:2000) and anti-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:2000), respectively. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using the ECL reagent.Molecular Modeling—A homology model of GPR92 was built on the basis of the 2.2-Å crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1U19) of the bovine rhodopsin (14Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) using the homology modeling program molIDE (15Canutescu A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2914-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms and Kollman-all charges were added to the homology model of GPR92 using Sybyl v7.0 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The three-dimensional structure of FPP and NAG was sketched and refined using the Sybyl program with the Gasteiger-Huckel charge method. The virtual docking of clomipramine was performed using GOLD v3.0, a program that applies stochastic genetic algorithms for conformational searching (16Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). The number of genetic operations was set to 1 × 105, and the population size was set to 1 × 102. All structural figures were prepared using PyMol v0.98 (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Francisco, CA).Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues using TRI Reagent (Sigma). Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: mGPR92-F (5′-TGGCAGAGTCTTCTGGACACT-3′; 681-701) and mGPR92-R (5′-GCCAAAGGCCTGGTTTCAGCG-3′; 989-1010). The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57.5 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under a UV light source.Immunocytochemistry and Histochemistry—The mouse lumbar DRG was isolated from 6-week-old male C57B/6 mice. The human DRG was isolated from fresh cadavers with the informed consent of the relatives of body donors and the approval of the ethics committee of the Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. The isolated DRG was fixed for 4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose. The DRG was serially cut (10 μm) on a cryostat and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. Slides were incubated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight in primary antibody at 4 °C and washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The primary antibodies used in this study are as follows: mouse GPR92 (1:100, MBL International, Woburn, MA), human GPR92 (1:1000, Abcam), mouse and human TRPV1 (1:1000, Abcam), and neurofilament 200 kDa (NF200; 1:1000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After several washes, sections were incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit-Alexa594 antibody for human and mouse GPR92, anti-guinea pig-Alexa488 antibody for TRPV1, and anti-mouse-Alexa488 antibody for NF200, Molecular Probes), and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst33342 (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence labeling was observed under an LSM510 confocal laser microscope (Zeiss). Images were optimized for quantification using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).DRG Cultures and Intracellular Ca2+ Imaging—Cultured DRG neurons were prepared using a technique modified from Rhim et al. (17Rhim H. Kim H. Lee D.Y. Oh T.H. Nah S.Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 436: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly DRG were isolated from all levels of the lumbar and sacral spinal cord from Sprague-Dawley rats (100-150 g) and incubated with 0.15% collagenase (Sigma) for 20 min and then with 0.125% trypsin (Sigma) for 10 min in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HEPES buffer solution at 37 °C. DRG neurons were then mechanically dissociated with Pasteur pipettes by trituration and plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For intracellular Ca2+ imaging recordings, cells were used within 1-2 days after plating. The diameter of each DRG neuron was defined as the average of the distance along the longest and shortest axis of the cell body. All chemicals used for cell preparation were purchased from Invitrogen. For intracellular Ca2+ imaging, the acetoxymethyl ester form of fura-2 (fura-2/AM, Molecular Probes) was used as the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. DRG neurons were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 5 μm fura-2/AM and 0.001% Pluronic F-127 in a HEPES-buffered solution composed of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Cells were then washed with HEPES-buffered solution and placed on an inverted microscope (Olympus). Cells were illuminated using a xenon arc lamp. The required excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) were selected with a computer-controlled filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Emitter fluorescence light was reflected through a 515-nm long pass filter to a frame transfer cooled CCD camera. The ratios of emitted fluorescence were calculated using a digital fluorescence analyzer. All imaging data were collected and analyzed using Meta Imaging Software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA).Cell Transfection—DRG cells were transfected after 1 day in culture using Lipofectamine 2000. Briefly GPR92 siRNA (5′-CGUUUGCAUAUGGUGUdTdT-3′) or a nontargeting scrambled siRNA (negative) and the Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in serum-free DMEM/F-12 were combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After the culture media were removed and saved, cells were incubated with the siRNA/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were then incubated with the saved culture media for 48 h. To monitor transfection efficiency, the GFP expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was co-transfected with each siRNA. For each Ca2+ imaging experiment, the transfected cells without the GFP vector were loaded with fura-2/AM after separately confirming transfection efficiency (>80%).Data Analysis—All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Data analysis was performed using nonlinear regression. Data are expressed using sigmoidal dose-response curves. Agonist concentrations inducing half-maximal stimulation (EC50) and maximal -fold increase (Emax) were calculated using the GraphPad PRISM4 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). One-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls post-test was used for data analyses. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSLigand Screening for GPR92—We previously established a widely applicable screening system to identify ligands for orphan GPCRs (4Oh D.Y. Kim K. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2006; 252: 163-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this system, cDNAs for orphan GPCR and GPCR signaling-specific reporter genes are introduced to adenovirus. These reporter genes include a cAMP-responsive element-driven luciferase gene (CRE-luc) for Gs- and Gi/o-linked pathways and SRE-luc for Gq/11- or G12/13-linked pathways (4Oh D.Y. Kim K. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2006; 252: 163-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Oh D.Y. Song J.A. Moon J.S. Moon M.J. Kim J.I. Kim K. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We screened ligands for GPR92 using CV-1 cells that were doubly infected by adenoviruses containing human GPR92 and SRE-luc or CRE-luc. Cells were treated with various lipid-derived molecules. GPR92 activity was determined by measuring luciferase activity.In an initial screening, FPP, NAG, LPA, 2-AG, N-arachidonyl γ-aminobutyric acid, N-palmitoylserine phosphoric acid, N-arachidonylalanine, and N-arachidonylserine were found to activate GPR92. Dose-response studies showed that FPP had the highest potency with an EC50 of 0.26 μm, approximately 10 times lower than that of LPA (Fig. 1A). NAG, 2-AG, N-arachidonyl γ-aminobutyric acid, and LPA showed EC50 values ranging from 2 to 5 μm (Table 1). Further FPP showed 3-fold higher efficacy than other lipid-derived molecules.TABLE 1Agonistic potency to induce SRE-luc activity in CV-1 cells expressing GPR92LigandEC50Emaxμm-fold induction over basalFPP0.26 ± 0.0828.79 ± 1.46NAG4.47 ± 0.738.20 ± 0.38LPA1.82 ± 0.738.76 ± 0.79NAA>10NAS>10NAGABA3.79 ± 1.344.15 ± 0.262-AG1.78 ± 0.639.04 ± 1.21NPSPA7.33 ± 2.873.92 ± 0.27 Open table in a new tab To examine whether the agonist-induced SRE-luc activity is mediated by G protein coupling, a [35S]GTPγS binding assay was performed using cells expressing GPR92 in the presence of various concentrations of FPP, LPA, or NAG. FPP dose-dependently increased [35S]GTPγS binding to cell fractions containing GPR92 with a higher potency than NAG and LPA (Fig. 1B). No agonist-induced increases in [35S]GTPγS binding were observed in mock-infected cells.Signaling Pathways of GPR92—To investigate the signaling pathways of GPR92, we determined the levels of various second messengers after treatment with FPP, NAG, or LPA. Treatment of GPR92-expressing cells with these agonists resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in IP production. FPP showed the highest potency for IP production followed by LPA and NAG (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Agonist-induced production of IP was completely blocked by U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, indicating that GPR92 is Gq-coupled (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2GPR92-mediated signaling pathways. A and C, IP production (A) or cAMP accumulation (C) in response to various concentrations of FPP, NAG, or LPA were determined in CV-1 cells infected with adenoviruses containing GPR92. B and D, the specificity of the signaling pathway was verified by pretreating with U73122 (10 μm), a phospholipase C inhibitor (B), and MDL-12330A (10 μm), an adenylate cyclase inhibitor (C), 15 min before treatment with 10 μm FPP, NAG, or LPA, respectively. a, p < 0.05 versus the control group (basal); b, p < 0.05 versus the agonist-stimulated group.

Cells were treated with various concentration of FPP and NAG. F, ERK1/2 activation by agonists in GPR92-infected cells. CV-1 cells were infected with 100 m.o.i. adenoviruses with GPR92 and were serum-starved for 16 h prior to agonist stimulation. The mock-infected cells (F, upper panel) were treated with 1 μm FPP, 10 μm of NAG and LPA, and 200 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as a positive control for 5 min. GPR92-infected CV-1 cells (F, middle panel) were treated with various concentrations of NAG and FPP.

Nicastrin has been proposed to operate as the substrate receptor of the complex with the glutamate 332 (Glu333 in human) serving as the anionic binding site for the α-amino-terminal group of substrates. The putative binding site is located within the aminopeptidase-like domain of Nicastrin. The Glu332 is proposed to function as the counterpart of the exopeptidase Glu located in the active site of these peptidases. Although Glu332 could bind the α-amino-terminal group of substrates, we hypothesized, in analogy with M28-aminopeptidases, that other residues in the putative binding site of Nicastrin should participate in the interaction as well. Surprisingly, mutagenesis of these residues affected the in vivo processing of APP and Notch substrates only weakly. In addition, the E332Q mutation, which completely abolishes the anionic α-amino-terminal binding function, remained fully active. When we introduced the previously characterized E332A mutation, we found strongly decreased γ-secretase complex levels, but the remaining complex appeared as active as the wild-type complex. We confirmed in two independent in vitro assays that the specific enzymatic activity of the E332A mutant was comparable with that of the wild-type complex. Thus, Glu332 crucially affects complex maturation rather than substrate recognition. Moreover other Nicastrin mutants, designed to either impede or alter substantially the putative binding pocket, affected only marginally γ-secretase activity. Consequently, these studies indicate that the main role of the Glu332 is in the maturation and assembly of γ-secretase rather than in the recognition of the substrates.

Consequently, these studies indicate that the main role of the Glu332 is in the maturation and assembly of γ-secretase rather than in the recognition of the substrates. The γ-secretase is a multimeric membrane complex with aspartyl proteolytic activity. In contrast to other intramembrane proteases, the γ-secretase cleaves type I transmembrane proteins with broad specificity (1Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The size of the ectodomain determines whether a type I membrane protein is a γ-secretase substrate (3Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol.

In addition to other substrates, this protease complex cleaves the COOH-terminal 99-amino acid fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) 3The abbreviations used are: APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, amyloid β peptide; AICD, APP intracellular domain; AP-like domain, aminopeptidase-like domain; CTF, COOH-terminal fragment; Nct–/– cells, Nicastrin knockout cells; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; NCT, Nicastrin; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; Ps, presenilin; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type. within the membrane at different positions, to release the COOH-terminal intracellular domain (AICD) and COOH-terminal heterogeneous amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) (4De Strooper B.

Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides are the major component of amyloid deposits in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease, and the longer Aβ42 peptide generation appears to be crucial in the Alzheimer amyloid cascade (6Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11121) Google Scholar, 7Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 2004; 11: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Therefore, reduction of Aβ42 by specific inhibition of one of the key enzymes involved in its generation, the β- or the γ-secretase, is highly desirable. The γ-secretase complex is formed by presenilin (Ps), Nicastrin (Nct), anterior pharynx defective (Aph1), and presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen-2) (4De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H.

Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) and Nct, a type 1 transmembrane protein with a large and highly glycosylated ectodomain (Nct-ECD), has been implicated in the initial recognition of substrates (13Shah S.

Aph1 and Pen-2 are multipass transmembrane proteins that have been proposed to play a structural role in the assembly and maturation of the complex (14Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Kostka M. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1520-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol.

Although the sequence of events preceding full assembly and activation of the protease complex is controversial, the current hypothesis suggests that formation of the Nct-Aph1 subcomplex is the first step in γ-secretase assembly, followed by sequential incorporation of the Ps and Pen-2 subunits, respectively, or alternatively, incorporation of the Ps-Pen-2 subcomplex (16Hu Y.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nct homology with the M28 aminopeptidase superfamily initially led to speculation that the proposed Nct aminopeptidase (AP)-like domain might possess catalytic activity or could serve as a binding domain for substrates (20Fagan R. Swindells M. Overington J. Weir M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 213-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More recently, demonstration that Nct acts as a substrate receptor (13Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Sudhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and is rate-limiting for access to the protease active site, suggests that this function could be exploited as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease. According to the prevailing Nct receptor model, the initial binding of substrates to the γ-secretase complex crucially depends on a salt interaction between human Nct-E333 (Glu332 in mouse) and the α-amino-terminal group of the substrate, which leads to translocation and docking of the substrate in the catalytic core (13Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Sudhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This model proposes that Nct-Glu333 is the counterpart of the Glu residue present within the exopeptidase motif of APs (21Vazeux G. Iturrioz X. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Luciani N. Marie-Claire C. Ruffet E. Beaumont A. Roques B.P. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which is essential for the binding of the α-amino-terminal group of substrates and inhibitors. Furthermore, the model suggests that apart from Glu333 no other key structural determinants are involved in the Nct recognition mechanism, explaining the broad specificity of the γ-secretase. However, no further quantitative data are available to support this assumption. Indeed, functional and structural analysis of aminopeptidases, such as acidic and arginyl aminopeptidase LTA4H, has demonstrated that other residues in addition to the exopeptidase Glu are involved in substrate recognition (23Iturrioz X. Rozenfeld R. Michaud A. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14440-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Tholander F. Kull F. Ohlson E. Shafqat J. Thunnissen M.M. Haeggstrom J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33477-33486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In particular, this has been demonstrated for the Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase, one of the most similar counterparts of Nct (25Reiland V. Gilboa R. Spungin-Bialik A. Schomburg D. Shoham Y. Blumberg S. Shoham G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between Nct and the M28 enzymes and the conserved functional role of Nct-Glu332 (exopeptidase Glu in aminopeptidases) suggests a common substrate binding mode for aminopeptidases and this γ-secretase subunit. Thus, we hypothesized that additional residues in the Nct AP-like domain, as in the aminopeptidases, participate in the interaction with the substrates. To further characterize the contribution of Nct to γ-secretase function, we constructed a structural model of the AP-like domain of Nct, and then used this model to identify critical residues within the putative substrate binding site that may play a role in substrate recognition. Our results demonstrate that the mouse Nct-E332A and E332Q mutants strongly impair complex assembly but not complex activity as assessed by their specific activities, indicating that the substrate recognition/binding mechanism is mainly unaffected by these substitutions. Furthermore, additional mutations in the putative binding pocket altered γ-secretase complex levels but not its specific activity, supporting the crucial involvement of this domain in the maturation and proper assembly of the γ-secretase complex. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against mouse Ps1 NTF (B19.3), APH1a (B80.3), PEN-2 (B126.1), and APP COOH terminus (B63.3) and monoclonal 9C3 against the COOH terminus of Nicastrin have been described (26Annaert W.G.

Nct–/– MEFs were transduced using a replication-defective recombinant retroviral expression system (Clontech) with either wild-type or mutant mouse Nct. Stable Nct cell lines were selected with puromycin (5 μg/ml). Transduction with APP Adenovirus and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—MEF cell lines were transduced with the recombinant adenovirus Ad5/CMV-APP bearing human APP-695 (29Yuan H. Zhai P.

NICD levels were determined with a cleavage specific antibody (cleaved Notch1 Val1744) and quantified relative to the levels of Notch ΔE using an anti-Myc antibody.

Before collection, cells were treated overnight with 10 μm GM6001 inhibitor (Sigma) to avoid C83-3xFLAG generation.

Immunoaffinity purification was carried out with the anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's protocols. APP C99-3xFLAG was eluted in 100 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.7, 0.25% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Sigma) and immediately neutralized to pH 7 by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. In Vitro Activity Assay Using Solubilized γ-Secretase—In vitro activity assay was done as previously described (35Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, MEF microsomal fractions (10 mg/ml) were solubilized in 1% CHAPSO buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Afterward, membrane-solubilized protein fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. 3–4 μg were used in the in vitro assay or 10 μg were analyzed by Western immunoblot with Ps1 CTF and Pen-2-specific antibodies. In vitro reactions with 0.8 μm APP C99-3xFLAG (in 20 μl final volume) were carried out in 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1× EDTA-free Complete proteinase inhibitors (Roche), 2.5% DMSO, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine, and 0.0125% phosphatidylethanolamine (N[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl]-(s)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester at 37 °C. In Vitro Activity Assays Using Microsomal Preparations—MEF cell lines were transiently transfected with an expression vector for C99-3xFLAG using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and collected 48 h post-transfection. Before collection, cultures were treated overnight with 5 μm inhibitor IX (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl]-(s) phenylglycine t-butyl ester). Membranes corresponding to one-fourth of a 75-cm2 flask were resuspended in 25 μl of 50 mm PIPES, pH 7, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA and incubated on ice or at 37 °C, followed by ultracentrifugation. AICD amounts were estimated from supernatants. AICD Quantification and Normalization—Unless indicated otherwise, AICD product was analyzed after 4 h incubation at 37 °C. Lipids and substrate were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and AICD determined by semi-quantitative Western blot using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody from Sigma and IR detection at 800 nm using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. For specific activities AICD was normalized against Ps1 CTF and PEN-2 present in the reactions. Trypsin-proteolytic Digestion Assays—0.5% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-extracted membrane proteins MEFs (see “Microsomal Preparations”) were incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin (0–100 μg/ml) in 25 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, for 30 min at 30 °C. Proteolysis was stopped with addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and samples were analyzed by Western blot with a NCT-specific antibody. All the experiments in this paper were performed at least three times in duplicates or triplicates. The GraphPad Prism 4 software was used for statistical analysis and graphing. Identification of Critical Amino Acid Residues in the Aminopeptidase Fold of Nicastrin—To identify critical residues that contribute to the proposed substrate binding by Nct, and in the absence of structural information, we utilized the similarity between Nct and M28 enzymes, with a known crystal structure, to construct a three-dimensional model of the peptidase-like domain of Nct. In accordance with the literature (20Fagan R. Swindells M. Overington J. Weir M. Trends Biochem.

The aminopeptidase of S. griseus (SGAP) (40Greenblatt H.M. Almog O. Maras B. Spungin-Bialik A. Barra D. Blumberg S. Shoham G. J. Mol.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was used to construct a Nct peptidase-like domain model (residues 253 to 502) (Fig. 1A). Despite the low sequence identity between Nct and M28 peptidases (<20%), all algorithms utilized predicted, for the Nct domain, a hydrolase-like fold with very high levels of confidence (>99.9%). In agreement with Fagan et al. (20Fagan R. Swindells M. Overington J. Weir M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 213-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), three residues involved in the catalytic mechanism of aminopeptidases are conserved in the putative substrate binding pocket of the Nct model: Asp282, Glu332 (substrate binding site), and Tyr452 in mouse Nct, which are in analogous positions to residues Asp87, Glu131, and Tyr246 in SGAP. Asp87 is a second-shell residue that polarizes the His85 metal ligand; Glu131 participates as a general base during catalysis, involved in hydrogen bonding with the N terminus of the substrate, and Tyr246 stabilizes the transition state intermediate in this particular aminopeptidase. The other catalytic residues (metal ligands) in SGAP are, however, not conserved in Nct. These positions are occupied by residues Arg280, Ser296, Thr333, Gly365, and Gln453 in mouse Nct. Interestingly, the Nct model showed that Arg280 is located close to Glu332 and Glu363 residues, suggesting the existence of a salt bridge between these charged residues (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the negatively charged residue conserved at position 363 in all Nct sequences suggests that it could be of functional significance. Accordingly, we selected Arg280, Asp282, Ser296, Thr333, Glu363, Gly365, Tyr452, and Gln453 residues for further mutagenesis analysis (Table 1).TABLE 1Selection of residues for site-directed mutagenesisS. griseus leucyl aminopeptidaseHuman glutaminyl cyclaseAnalogous positions in mNCTResidues conservationMutantsHis85Metal ligandHis140In the active site pocketArg280Ser in plantsSerAsp87In the active site pocketAsp142In the active site pocketAsp282Completetly conservedAlaAsp97Metal ligandAsp159Metal ligandSer296Asp in insects, Gly in fishGly, Trp, LysGlu131Catalytic residueGlu201Catalytic residueGlu332Conserved, substrate binding siteAlaGlnGlu132Metal ligandGlu202Metal ligandThr333Ala in fish/plants, Ser in insectsAlaAsp160Metal ligandAsp248In the active site pocketGly365Asn in chincken, Gln in C. elegansAsnArg202Substrate binding siteGly301—Asp305Subs/Inh binding sitePro422—Ser425Higly conservedAlaTyr246Catalytic residueTrp329Substrate binding siteTyr452Val in Caenorhabditis elegansAlaHis247Metal ligandHis330Metal ligandGln453His in plants/insects, Glu in fishAlaHis, GluGlu363Charge conserved, close to Glu332AlaArg431NOT in the pocketAla Open table in a new tab In addition, we used the x-ray crystal structures of SGAP and human glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase in complex with inhibitors (25Reiland V.

A. 2005; 102: 13117-13122Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to identify residues that could be involved in the recognition of substrates by Nct. In SGAP, the inhibitory amino acids bind to the two zinc ions, present in the active site of the peptidase, via their free carboxylate group. Further stabilization is achieved by their interaction with catalytic residues Tyr246 and Glu131, the metal ligand Asp160, and two other residues Arg202 and Phe219 (25Reiland V. Gilboa R. Spungin-Bialik A. Schomburg D. Shoham Y. Blumberg S. Shoham G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1738-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Arg202 residue is presented by a loop that approaches the SGAP catalytic site. Similarly, the corresponding loop in the human glutaminylpeptide cyclotransferase structure (Ile303–Asp305) approaches the active site and interacts with the backbone of the inhibitors (41Huang K.F. Liu Y.L. Cheng W.J. Ko T.P. Wang A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13117-13122Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In our Nct model, the equivalent loop contains the 423PSS425 residues. Interestingly, multiple sequence alignments show that the 422PPSS425 motif is highly conserved, in particular Pro422, Pro423, and Ser425 are completely conserved in all reported Nct sequences. Our model also suggests that the 421LPPSS425 loop delineates the binding pocket and that Ser425 may interact by a hydrogen bond with Glu332 (Fig. 1A). Based on this comparison, the Ser425 residue was included in our mutagenesis analysis. Finally, the alanine substitution of the previously identified Glu332 critical residue (Glu333 in human NCT) was included as a positive control and the R431A substitution, which is not located in the pocket, was used as a negative control. For a summary, see Table 1. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression in Cell Culture—To investigate the contribution of the selected residues to the putative substrate binding site of Nct, we introduced single amino acid substitutions that minimally disturb the overall folding of the domain but should substantially change the binding properties of the pocket. As indicated in Table 1, in most cases we replaced the selected residues with alanine. We also used additional substitutions taking into account sequence information from the NCT orthologues (see Table 1). Finally, we investigated mutations that should impede substrate binding, either by eliminating the anionic binding site (E332Q), or by introducing bulky residues at Ser296, a position supposed to sterically block the pocket or neutralize the Glu332 side chain: S296W, S296K, respectively. In our analysis, we used Nct knock-out mouse fibroblasts (Nct–/– MEFs) to avoid interference of endogenously expressed wild-type Nct, which also allowed us to investigate to what extent the different mutants were able to restore γ-secretase assembly. We generated at least two different cell lines stably expressing each mutant. We confirmed that Nct expression levels were similar to endogenous expression levels in Nct wild-type cells, minimizing overexpression artifacts (Fig. 2). Interestingly, most mutants became glycosylated, indicating transport throughout the secretory pathway, with the exception of the E332A. An alanine substitution at position Glu332 dramatically decreased Nct complex glycosylation and its incorporation into the γ-secretase complex (see below). We have previously shown that γ-secretase activity does not depend on glycosylation of Nct (33Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and therefore the functional significance of decreased or increased glycosylation of Nct mutants is difficult to assess. Residues Located in the Putative Binding Pocket of Nct Affect Notch and APP Cleavage to a Limited Extent—We next investigated whether any of the Nct substitutions influenced γ-secretase processing of APP or Notch, by transducing the different mutant stable cell lines with full-length APPswe or Myc-tagged NotchΔE.

However, the relationship between α-synuclein aggregation and the impaired proteasome activity is yet unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of three soluble α-synuclein species (monomer, dimer, and protofibrils) on the degradation activity of the 26 S proteasome by reconstitution of proteasomal degradation using highly purified 26 S proteasomes and model substrates. We found that none of the three soluble α-synuclein species impaired the three distinct peptidase activities of the 26 S proteasome when using fluorogenic peptides as substrates. In striking contrast, α-synuclein protofibrils, but not monomer and dimer, markedly inhibited the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of unstructured proteins and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of folded proteins when present at 5-fold molar excess to the 26 S proteasome. Together these results indicate that α-synuclein protofibrils have a pronounced inhibitory effect on 26 S proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Because α-synuclein is a substrate of the proteasome, impaired proteasomal activity could further cause α-synuclein accumulation/aggregation, thus creating a vicious cycle and leading to Parkinson disease pathogenesis. Furthermore we found that α-synuclein protofibrils bound both the 26 S proteasome and substrates of the 26 S proteasome. Accordingly we propose that the inhibitory effect of α-synuclein protofibrils on 26 S proteasomal degradation might result from impairing substrate translocation by binding the proteasome or sequestrating proteasomal substrates by binding the substrates.

Psychiatry. 1997; 62: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The pathological hallmarks of PD are the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies contain dozens of proteins and lipids with α-synuclein (αSyn), which is deposited as fibrillar forms, as the predominant protein (2Shults C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 3Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5871) Google Scholar). αSyn is a 140-amino acid protein found enriched in the presynaptic terminus. Structurally αSyn adopts a random coil conformation in solution, whereas the N-terminal amphipathic domain turns into an α-helical structure when associated on anionic membrane surfaces (4Uversky V.N. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The possible physiological functions of αSyn include regulating synaptic plasticity, dopamine neurotransmission, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi trafficking, and acting as a molecular chaperone (5Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neuron. 2006; 52: 33-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). An abundance of evidence has implicated αSyn in PD pathogenesis. Genetically three point mutations in the αSyn gene (A30P, E46K, and A53T) are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of PD (6Kruger R. Kuhn W. Muller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M. Kosel S.

Singleton A.B. Neurology. 2004; 62: 1835-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), indicating that simply increasing αSyn concentration is enough for disease pathogenesis. Biochemically αSyn aggregation is a nucleation-dependent process, which is exacerbated by some disease-causing mutants and C-terminal truncations (4Uversky V.N. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 17-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Importantly, animals overexpressing αSyn, especially disease-associated mutants, develop movement disorder accompanying αSyn aggregation, recapitulating some features of PD and several other neurodegenerative diseases related to αSyn aggregation including dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy (13Fernagut P.O. Chesselet M.F. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 17: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The impaired mitochondrial function and ubiquitin-proteasome activity are the two leading factors contributing to PD pathogenesis at least in part through accelerating αSyn aggregation (14Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is responsible for the degradation of the majority of intracellular proteins, and it plays essential roles in maintaining almost every aspect of cellular activities including gene transcription, protein translation, cell development, signal transduction, and protein quality control (15Borissenko L. Groll M. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 687-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is a 2.5-MDa complex consisting of the 20 S proteasome and the 19 S regulatory complex (called PA700 in mammals). The eukaryotic 20 S proteasome has a heptameric, four-ring stacked structure arranged as α1–7β1–7β1–7α1–7. Three of the β subunits have distinct peptidase activities: β1 has a caspase-like activity, β2 has a trypsinlike activity, and β5 has a chymotrypsin-like activity. The six catalytic sites are housed inside the β chamber, which is sequestered from intracellular proteins by α chambers with sealed entrances (16Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Interestingly the sealed entrance can be opened upon association with proteasomal regulatory complexes PA28, PA200, and PA700 (17Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Only PA700, when associated on either or both ends of the 20 S proteasome that forms the 26 S proteasomes, has the ability to mediate the degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins. PA700 has 20 subunits, which possess activities to bind a polyubiquitin chain, bind denatured proteins, unfold protein substrates, catalyze substrate deubiquitination, and hydrolyze ATP (18Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar, 19Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Coordinated actions of these activities are necessary to mediate the degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins (20Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although both the 20 and 26 S proteasome can degrade unstructured proteins without a polyubiquitin chain modification (21Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 22Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the physiological role of the 20 S proteasome is still under debate. Several lines of evidence indicate a direct link of the impaired proteasome function to PD pathogenesis. Genetic mutations in PARK genes (PARK 2 encoding Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, and PARK 5 encoding ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1) encoding two components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are associated with familial PD (23Kitada T.

Nature. 1998; 395: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Histologically, immunohistological staining has revealed that Lewy bodies contain a great abundance of ubiquitin, ubiquitinated proteins, and proteasomal subunits (25Kuzuhara S. Mori H. Izumiyama N. Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 75: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 26Ii K. Ito H. Tanaka K. Hirano A. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Biochemical studies have shown the loss of proteasomal subunits and the impaired proteasomal activities in the substantia nigra pars compacta in sporadic PD (27McNaught K.S. Belizaire R. Isacson O. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 179: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies on animal models corroborate the involvement of proteasome dysfunction in the neurodegenerative process where administration of proteasome inhibitors induces dopaminergic neuronal death and the formation of αSyn/ubiquitin-containing inclusions in the surviving neurons (28McNaught K.S.

Consistently, two recent reports showed that αSyn or its insoluble aggregated forms directly inhibit proteasome activity. Lindersson et al. (38Lindersson E. Beedholm R. Hojrup P. Moos T. Gai W.

Also they found that the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20 S proteasome is inhibited by both αSyn monomer and insoluble αSyn aggregates (34Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J. Matouschek A.

An emerging concept in the neurodegenerative disease field is that the potential cytotoxic species are soluble oligomeric intermediates, such as protofibrils, but not the insoluble fibrils deposited in diseased brains. Much evidence supports this concept from αSyn aggregation related to PD pathogenesis. In vitro studies showed that both earlier onset familial PD-causing mutations, A30P and A53T, promote αSyn protofibril formation relative to wild-type protein, whereas the A30P mutation retards fibril formation (39Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), suggesting that the pathogenic form is αSyn protofibrils or other soluble oligomers. Consistently, αSyn protofibrils, not fibrils, promote cell death when introduced in cell culture media (40Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G.

Moreover, transgenic mice expressing human αSyn develop nonfibrillar intraneuronal inclusions, lose dopaminergic terminals, and show motor impairments (42Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Introducing human αSyn gene into the substantia nigra of rats causes the formation of nonfibrillar inclusions and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons (43Lo B.C. Ridet J.L. Schneider B.L. Deglon N. Aebischer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10813-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that fibril formation is not necessary for neurodegeneration. Pathologically, recent studies demonstrate that the formation of soluble oligomers accompanies Alzheimer disease and PD pathology (40Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C.

Whether the potential cytotoxic αSyn protofibrils could directly impair proteasome function, especially the physiologically important 26 S proteasome, is unknown. Here using fluorogenic peptides, unstructured proteins, and a polyubiquitinated protein as substrates, we examined the effects of three soluble αSyn species (monomer, dimer, and protofibrils) on the protein degradation activity of highly purified 26 S proteasomes. Reagents—Epoxomicin was purchased from BIOMOL International. Fluorogenic peptides were from Bachem. MG132 was from Sigma. Antibodies for the following proteins were purchased: anti-αSyn monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-polyhistidine (His-1) and anti-β-actin (AC-15) (Sigma), anti-UbcH10 polyclonal antibody (Boston Biochem), anti-p21cip1 (c-19), anti-IκBα (C-21) (sc-371), and anti-Ub (P4D1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-p31 polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. G. N. DeMartino (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—αSyn, His6-p21cip1, His6-UbcH10, UbD77, UbK48C, His6-E1, and GST-E225K were purified as described previously (20Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K.

His6-securin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) resins following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified securin was kept in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. PolyUb chains were synthesized according to a protocol established by Pickart and Raasi (46Pickart C.M. Raasi S. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Proteasome Purification—PA700 and 26 S proteasomes were purified from bovine red blood cells as described previously (20Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J.

Preparation and Separation of αSyn Monomer, Dimer, and Protofibrils—αSyn protofibrils were prepared by a method established by Lansbury and co-workers (48Ding T.T. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To increase protofibril production, purified αSyn was repeatedly lyophilized and redissolved two to four times. Soluble samples were loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column on a fast performance liquid chromatography system. The concentration of protofibrils was quantitated by measuring the density of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as a standard and assuming an average molecular mass of 1,500 kDa. The concentrations of αSyn monomer and dimer were measured using ϵ280 = 5,960 cm-1 m-1 and ϵ280 = 11,920 cm-1 m-1, respectively. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra were collected at 22 °C on a JASCO-810 spectropolarimeter using a cuvette with a 0.1-cm optical path length. The data were acquired at 0.2-nm intervals with an average of eight scans. Absorptions from individual buffer were subtracted as backgrounds. Atomic Force Microscopy—Atomic force microscopy measurements were collected using a Nanoscope IIIa system (Digital Instruments Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) operating in the tapping mode. Tapping mode etched silicon tips with a cantilever length of 125 μm and a characteristic frequency of 300–330 kHz were used for image acquisition. Protein samples were prepared according to the following procedures: 1) dipping the silicon wafers into 10 mm poly(diallydimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) solution for 10 min, 2) rinsing the PDDA-treated silicon wafers with Milli-Q water for 2 min, 3) dipping the washed silicon wafers into protein samples for 10 min, and 4) rinsing the protein-bound silicon wafers with Milli-Q water for 2 min. The advantages of using PDDA treatment are as follows. 1) PDDA is uniformly adsorbed on the silicon wafer, and the thickness of the PDDA layer is less than 0.3 nm so it does not have an obvious effect on the atomic force microscopy measurement of binding proteins. 2) The positive-charged PDDA layer allows the negative-charged proteins to be stably adsorbed on the silicon matrix due to the electrostatic attraction. Assay of Proteasomal Peptidase Activities and Deubiquitination Activity—For the proteasomal peptidase assay, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-Amc, Z-Leu-Leu-Arg-Amc, and Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-Amc fluorogenic peptides were used to monitor the chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and caspase-like activities of the 26 S proteasome, respectively. Appropriate concentrations of αSyn monomer, dimer, or protofibrils as indicated in the figure legend were incubated with 10 nm 26 S proteasome in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 5 min. 10-μl mixtures were then added to 200 μl of 50 μm fluorogenic peptide substrates in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. For the proteasomal deubiquitinase assay, 5 nm 26 S proteasome and 250 nm αSyn protofibrils in buffer A were preincubated for 5 min before adding 500 nm Ub-Amc. Fluorescence of released Amc was continuously monitored using a Synergy HT plate reader (BioTek) with an excitation/emission filter set at 360/40 and 460/40 nm, respectively. Activities were calculated by the slopes of the linear portions of the fluorescence curves. The results represented an average of three independent experiments. Assaying Proteasomal Degradation of Non-ubiquitinated Proteins and Polyubiquitinated Protein in Vitro—Lys-48-linked tetraubiquitin-conjugated UbcH10 (Ub4-UbcH10) was synthesized according to a recent report (20Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Purified 26 S proteasomes were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in buffer A with 1× PA700 to promote the assembly of doubly capped 26 S proteasome. Degradation of αSyn monomer, dimer, and protofibrils; p21cip1; securin; or Ub4-UbcH10 was performed in buffer A except that 125 mm NaCl was present in the buffer for the degradation of p21cip1 and securin. Concentrations of the proteasome and substrates are indicated in the figure legends. To determine the effect of αSyn monomer, dimer, and protofibrils on the degradation of p21cip1, securin, and Ub4-UbcH10, 1-, 5-, 25-, or 125-fold molar excess amounts of αSyn species were preincubated with the 26 S proteasome for 5 min prior to the supplementation of each substrate. At each designated time point, samples were withdrawn, and reactions were stopped by adding 5× SDS sample buffer. Degradation was evaluated by immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. Assaying αSyn Aggregation in Cultured Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 250 ng/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. At 50–60% confluence, the cells were transfected with empty pcDNA 3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) or the vector containing a myc-αSyn-HA insert using ExGen 500 transfection reagent (Fermentas). 48 h post-transfection, cells in a 10-cm plate were lysed into buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was collected as P1. The supernatant (S1) was further centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to further separate the Triton X-100-soluble (S2) and -insoluble (P2) fractions. Both P1 and P2 were washed five times with the lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer for immunoblotting using anti-αSyn antibody. Monitoring the Effect of αSyn Overexpression on Degradation of Endogenous Proteins in Cultured HEK293 Cells—48 h post-transfection of αSyn, cells in 35-mm plates were treated with 80 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. To determine IκBα degradation, the cells were treated with 20 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α to induce its rapid degradation. The cells were harvested at designated time points and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixtures). The degradation of endogenous p21cip1, UbcH10, and IκBα was evaluated by immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. Determining αSyn Protofibrils and PA700 Interaction—To assay αSyn protofibril binding to PA700, 100 μg of PA700 was preincubated with 200 μg of αSyn protofibrils at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min to pellet any insoluble aggregates prior to loading into a Superose 6 (16/60) gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein separation was conducted by a fast performance liquid chromatography system at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min and fraction size of 800 μl. 20 μl of each fraction was applied to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting assays. Size Exclusion Spin Column Assay—Micro Bio-Spin P-30 chromatography columns with an exclusion limit of 40 kDa (Bio-Rad) or homemade Sephadex G-75 spin columns with an exclusion limit of 80 kDa (matrix from Sigma and empty columns from Bio-Rad) were used to determine the interaction between αSyn species and the proteins of interest. Briefly, different molar ratios of αSyn monomer, dimer, or protofibrils were incubated with target proteins in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for 10 min. 60 μl of mixtures was then loaded into spin columns, and the centrifugation steps were followed according to the manufact"
https://openalex.org/W2028937313,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ). Interestingly, 18 of 22 mutations are concentrated in the C1 domain, which binds diacylglycerol and is necessary for translocation and regulation of PKCγ kinase activity. To determine the effect of these mutations on PKCγ function and the pathology of SCA14, we investigated the enzymological properties of the mutant PKCγs. We found that wild-type PKCγ, but not C1 domain mutants, inhibits Ca2+ influx in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation. The sustained Ca2+ influx induced by muscarinic receptor ligation caused prolonged membrane localization of mutant PKCγ. Pharmacological experiments showed that canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are responsible for the Ca2+ influx regulated by PKCγ. Although in vitro kinase assays revealed that most C1 domain mutants are constitutively active, they could not phosphorylate TRPC3 channels in vivo. Single molecule observation by the total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed that the membrane residence time of mutant PKCγs was significantly shorter than that of the wild-type. This fact indicated that, although membrane association of the C1 domain mutants was apparently prolonged, these mutants have a reduced ability to bind diacylglycerol and be retained on the plasma membrane. As a result, they fail to phosphorylate TRPC channels, resulting in sustained Ca2+ entry. Such an alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis and Ca2+-mediated signaling in Purkinje cells may contribute to the neurodegeneration characteristic of SCA14.

Autosomal dominant SCA14 is a genetically heterogenous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive motor incoordination affecting the gait and limbs, cerebellar dysarthria, and nystagmus due to degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells. SCA14 is caused by missense or in-frame deletion mutations in the PRKCG gene encoding protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) 2The abbreviations used are: PKCγ, protein kinase Cγ; SCA14, spinocerebellar ataxia type 14; Cch, carbachol; DAG, diacylglycerol; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; PS, phosphatidylserine; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate; DsRed, DsRed monomer; CHOhm1, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+; t½[Ca2+]i, the period required to reach the half-maximal level of intracellular Ca2+; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; DiC10, (±)-1,2-didecanoylglycerol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase.

PKCγ is a member of the PKC family that plays critical roles in many cellular functions, affecting diverse signal transduction pathways (2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). PKCγ is selectively expressed in neurons throughout the brain and is most abundant in cerebellar Purkinje cells (3Tanaka C. Saito N. Neurochem. Int. 1992; 21: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which specifically degenerate in SCA14 patients. One of the characteristic features of PKCγ is its translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (4Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Translocation is a hallmark of enzyme activation and is triggered by the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. It is well known that activation of such receptors causes elevations of DAG and intracellular Ca2+ (5Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). PKCγ contains C1 and C2 domains in its regulatory domain (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). The C1 domain has two zinc-finger motifs, C1A and C1B, that contain highly conserved Cys residues that bind to diacylglycerol (DAG) and tumor promoting phorbol esters. The C2 domain is a Ca2+ sensor that binds phosphatidylserine (PS) in the presence of elevated Ca2+. The C1 and C2 domains play crucial roles in PKCγ translocation through binding to DAG and Ca2+, respectively. The pathogenesis of SCA14 is not well understood. PKCγ knock-out mice exhibit persistent cerebellar multiple climbing fiber innervation and a slight ataxia. However, they do not have cerebellar degeneration (7Kano M. Hashimoto K. Chen C. Abeliovich A. Aiba A. Kurihara H. Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1995; 83: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 8Chen C. Kano M. Abeliovich A. Chen L. Bao S. Kim J.J. Hashimoto K. Thompson R.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1995; 83: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, gain-of-function, rather than loss-of-function, of PKCγ may be responsible for the cerebellar neurodegeneration in SCA14. Previously, we have reported that mutant PKCγs aggregate and cause cell death of several cultured cell systems (9Seki T. Adachi N. Ono Y. Mochizuki H. Hiramoto K. Amano T. Matsubayashi H.

Shimahara T. Saito N. Sakai N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 3126-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the aggregation was not observed in the Purkinje cells of a SCA14 patient who carried the H101Y mutation (1Chen D.H. Brkanac Z. Verlinde C.L. Tan X.J. Bylenok L. Nochlin D. Matsushita M.

This suggests that not only the aggregated, but also the soluble, fraction of mutant PKCγ may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCA14. To date, 22 different PKCγ mutations have been found in SCA14 families, 18 of which map to the C1 domain (11Dalski A. Mitulla B. Burk K. Schattenfroh C. Schwinger E. Zuhlke C. J.

This fact strongly suggests that these mutations disturb a fundamental property of PKCγ including membrane translocation and activator-dependent regulation of its kinase activity. In the present study, we tested whether these C1 domain mutations influence membrane translocation and activation of PKCγ. Our results show that C1 domain mutants have a shorter residence time on the plasma membrane. This results in decreased phosphorylation of the TRPC3 channel and alters Ca2+ influx. Our results suggest that alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis induced by mutant PKCγ may contribute to SCA14.

For cDNA cloning of human TRPC3, total RNA was extracted from HEK-293 cells using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). After DNase I treatment, total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using random primers and the Thermo-Script™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). PCR primers were designed based on a published nucleotide sequence of human TRPC3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_003305). Amplified TRPC3 gene was cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma). TRPC3 cDNA was verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, SH-SY5Y, and HEK-293 cells were purchased from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). CHO cells expressing human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 (CHOhm1) were a gift from Dr. Tatsuya Haga. COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Wako, Osaka, Japan), SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen), and CHOhm1 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium α medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All media contained 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (500 units/ml), and streptomycin (500 μg/ml). For SH-SY5Y cells, 1% GlutaMAX™-I (Invitrogen) was added. Transient expression in COS-7 cells was performed by electroporation (4Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and SH-SY5Y, HEK-293, and CHOhm1 cells were transfected by lipofection using FuGENE™ 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (18Adachi N. Oyasu M. Taniguchi T. Yamaguchi Y. Takenaka R. Shirai Y. Saito N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 139: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were cultured in EX-CELL™ 420 (JRH Biosciences) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) in a temperature-controlled orbital shaker operating at 150 rpm at 27.5 °C. Observation of PKCγ Translocation—The culture medium of CHOhm1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-GFPs (or PKCγ-DsReds) was replaced with Ringer's solution (135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES pH 7.35, 10 mm glucose). CaCl2 was added to the appropriate Ca2+ concentration depending on the experimental conditions. The fluorescence of the GFP was monitored with a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 488-nm argon excitation with a 515-535-nm band pass barrier filter, DsRed was excited with a 543-nm HeNe laser and detected using a 560-nm long pass filter. All experiments were done at 37 °C. Image analysis was performed using the Zeiss LSM 510 software, and the membrane fluorescence ratio was calculated as described previously (19Uchino M. Sakai N. Kashiwagi K. Shirai Y. Shinohara Y. Hirose K. Iino M. Yamamura T. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2254-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement—CHOhm1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-DsRed were incubated with 4 μm Fluo-4 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and 0.02% pluronic F-127 (Dojindo) in Ringer's solution containing 2 mm EGTA for 25 min at room temperature. Fluo-4 was loaded into SH-SY5Y and HEK-293 cells in Ringer's solution containing 2 mm Ca2+ (20 min, 37 °C). The cells were then washed twice with Ca2+-free Ringer's solution. The fluorescence of Fluo-4 was monitored by confocal microscopy. The time course of Ca2+ measurement was recorded using the Zeiss LSM 510 software. Fluorescence changes (ΔF/F0) within the cytoplasm of the cells were quantified as the fraction of the evoked change in Fluo-4 Ca2+ signal divided by the resting fluorescence level in Ca2+ free buffer recorded for 30 s prior to drug application. All cells within the plane of focus that had a change in Ca2+ signal were analyzed. All experiments were done at room temperature. In Vitro PKC Kinase Assay—COS-7 cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-GFPs were harvested and only the supernatant fraction of the recombinant PKC was used for the PKC kinase assay. Briefly, the cells were centrifuged, and resuspended in 400 μl of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). After sonication, samples were centrifuged (200,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected. To equalize the amount of PKCγ-GFP or its mutant proteins, GFP fluorescence intensity of the supernatants were measured by Mithras LB 940 (Berthold Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). For immunoprecipitation of PKCγ-GFP, an equivalent amount of GFP from each sample was rotated with anti-GFP antibody (1 h at 4 °C) and then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h. The beads were collected and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (-). Finally, 10 μl of suspended pellet was used for kinase assay as described previously (4Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, the kinase activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32P into myelin basic protein from [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of activators (20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.25 mm EGTA only) or in the presence of 8 μg/ml PS (Sigma), 0.8 μg/ml (±)-1,2-didecanoylglycerol (DiC10, BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and 50 μm Ca2+. In Vitro and in Vivo Phosphorylation of TRPC3—COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-TRPC3 were lysed in 400 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Samples were centrifuged (200,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel for 2 h at 4 °C and the pellet washed 4 times. Recombinant GST and GST-PKCγ were purified from BL21(DE3) pLys cells and Sf9 cells, respectively, using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Purified FLAG-TRPC3 on beads was incubated with purified GST (0.2 μg) or GST-PKCγ (0.2 μg) in the presence of 8 μg/ml PS, 0.8 μg/ml DiC10, and 500 μm Ca2+ with or without 1 mm GF 109203X for 15 min at 30 °C. For in vivo TRPC3 phosphorylation, COS-7 cells co-expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-GFP and FLAG-TRPC3 were labeled for 2 h with [γ-32P]phosphoric acid (0.33 mCi/ml) in Ringer's solution containing 2 mm EGTA. After extensively washing, the cells were incubated in Ringer's solution containing 2 mm Ca2+ with or without 200 nm TPA for 10 min. Cells were then harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) followed by sonication. After centrifugation, the pellets were solubilized in Lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described (18Adachi N. Oyasu M. Taniguchi T. Yamaguchi Y. Takenaka R. Shirai Y. Saito N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 139: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography using BAS2500 (FUJI Film). Single-molecule Imaging of PKCγ-GFP in Living CHOhm1 Cells—The apparatus, data acquisition, and data analysis will be described in detail. 3T. Kawasaki, T. Kobayashi, and N. Saito, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, individual PKCγ-GFP molecules in the plasma membrane of CHOhm1 cells were visualized using an objective-type total internal reflection microscope constructed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX81, Olympus, Japan) (20Iino R. Koyama I. Kusumi A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2667-2677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21Tokunaga M. Kitamura K. Saito K. Iwane A.H. Yanagida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cells were illuminated with 488 nm light from a blue laser (Sapphire 488; Coherent, Japan) using a ×100 objective (PlanApo, NA = 1.45; Olympus, Japan). Fluorescence images were intensified with image intensifier (C8600; Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) and obtained at video rate with an electron bombardment CCD camera (C7190-23; Hamamatsu Photonics). The fluorescent spots were tracked and analyzed to determine the residence time of PKCγ molecules on the plasma membrane. SCA14 Mutant PKCγ Exhibits Prolonged Membrane Localization—As 18 of 22 mutations in SCA14 families are located in the C1 domain of PKCγ (Fig. 1) and the C1 domain is responsible for membrane binding in PKC translocation, we first examined whether these C1 domain mutations affect the membrane targeting of PKCγ. CHOhm1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCγ-DsRed (H101Y, G118D, S119P, Q127R, and G128D) were stimulated with Cch and membrane translocation assessed by confocal microscopy. Both wild-type and mutant PKCγ-DsRed translocated in response to Cch (supplemental Fig. S1). However, whereas wild-type PKCγ rapidly returned (“retranslocated”) to the cytoplasm, retranslocation was delayed in the C1 domain mutants. To assess the temporal differences in re-translocation between wild-type and mutant PKCγ, wild-type PKCγ-DsRed and GFP-conjugated PKCγ carrying the G128D mutation were independently expressed in CHOhm1 cells and simultaneously observed (Fig. 2, A and B). Both wild-type and mutant PKCγ rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane in response to Cch. However, whereas re-translocation of wild-type PKCγ was complete by 80 s, membrane levels of the G128D mutant were still maximal. In fact, this prolonged membrane localization continued for at least 90 s; in some cases, it remained more than 3 min after stimulation (data not shown).FIGURE 2Prolonged membrane localization of SCA14 mutant by Cch stimulation in CHOhm1 cells. A, Cch-induced translocation of wild-type PKCγ-DsRed (WT-DsRed) and GFP-fused PKCγ carrying the G128D mutation (G128D-GFP). Wild-type and G128D mutant were transfected into CHOhm1 cells separately, and the movements of DsRed and GFP fluorescence induced by 10 μm Cch in Ringer's solution containing 2 mm Ca2+ were monitored simultaneously under a confocal laser scanning microscope. After 150 s, 5 mm EGTA was added to deplete the extracellular Ca2+. Images were collected every 10 s. B and D, the ratio (average intensity of fluorescence on the plasma membrane/average intensity of fluorescence in the cytosol) was plotted at each time point. C, the cells expressing wild-type or G128D were stimulated with Cch in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution. Data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Extracellular Ca2+ Is Responsible for Prolonged Membrane Localization of Mutant PKCγ—We have evidence that C1B peptides carrying SCA14 mutations (H101Y, S119P, Q127R, and V138E) have a decreased affinity for phorbol esters (PDBu). 4H. Takahashi, N. Adachi, T. Sugimoto, J. Nakakita, K. Irie, T. Seki, Y. Shirai, T. Ueyama, N. Sakai, and N. Saito, manuscript in preparation. Not surprisingly, the G128D mutation also exhibited lower phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding (data not shown). Thus, the affinity of the G128D mutant for endogenous DAG is also likely to be attenuated by mutations in the C1B domain. How then, are the mutants retained at the membrane? We tested the hypothesis that one of the other translocation factors, namely Ca2+, is involved in retaining the C1 domain mutants at the plasma membrane. Indeed, addition of the Ca2+ chelator, EGTA, to the extracellular solution resulted in immediate retranslocation of G128D mutant PKCγ-GFP (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, in Ca2+-free Ringer's solution, although G128D mutant exhibited a slight delay (about 10 s) in re-translocation compared with wild-type, both enzymes returned to the cytoplasm within 60 s (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicate that extracellular Ca2+ is responsible for the prolonged membrane localization of C1 domain mutant PKCγ. The Kinase Activity of PKCγ Is Required for Negative Regulation of Ca2+ Entry—We then investigated the effect of overexpression of PKCγ on Cch-induced Ca2+ entry in CHOhm1 cells. Ca2+ mobilization was assessed in Fluo4-loaded cells expressing wild-type PKCγ-DsRed or unconjugated DsRed as a control. As shown in Fig. 3A, Cch induced a rapid elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in both cells. However, the kinetics of the Ca2+ decrease in the cells expressing PKCγ-DsRed was distinct from DsRed. Specifically, the t½ [Ca2+]i of PKCγ-DsRed was 28.34 ± 5.44 s compared with 70.30 ± 8.69 s in DsRed-expressing cells. In addition, in Ca2+-free solution, the kinetics of Ca2+ decrease for PKCγ-DsRed and DsRed were identical (Fig. 3B). This data suggests that PKCγ modulates [Ca2+]i through plasma membrane calcium channels. To investigate whether catalytic activity is required for the negative regulation of Cch-induced Ca2+ entry, we examined the effect of PKC inhibitor, GF 109203X, on cells expressing wild-type PKCγ-DsRed or DsRed. The t½ [Ca2+]i of PKCγ-DsRed was prolonged in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of GF109203X (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the t½ [Ca2+]i for cells expressing a kinase-negative mutant (K380M) was significantly longer than that of wild-type in Ringer's solution containing Ca2+ (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that kinase activity of PKCγ is necessary for a rapid Ca2+ decay in response to Cch. C1 Domain Mutants Cannot Inhibit Ca2+ Entry—We then examined the effect of 17 missense mutations and one deletion mutation on the regulation of [Ca2+]i in CHOhm1 cells (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the t½ [Ca2+]i of all C1 domain mutants was significantly longer in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ compared with its absence; t½[Ca2+]i of wild-type was not significantly altered by addition or depletion of the extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4A). Thus, we concluded that the sustained high levels of [Ca2+]i are likely responsible for the prolonged membrane localization of these C1 domain mutant PKCγs. The kinase activity of PKCγ is required for a rapid Ca2+ decay in the cells (Fig. 3, C-E). However, the C1 domain mutants could not decrease [Ca2+]i after Cch stimulation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the C1 domain mutants were catalytically inactive. It is known that PKCγ is activated by PS and the DAG analog, DiC10. In addition, its kinase activity can be further elevated by the addition of Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S3). In this system, the kinase activity of wild-type PKCγ was enhanced 2.5-3-fold in the presence of PS, DiC10, and Ca2+ compared with their absence (i.e. Tris-HCl buffer with EGTA only). In contrast, all C1 domain mutants had high kinase activity, even in the absence of activators (Fig. 4B). Despite their high intrinsic kinase activity, the C1 domain mutants could not regulate [Ca2+]i levels. In regard to other four kinase domain mutants, we also observed translocation (supplemental Fig. S1), regulation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4A), and kinase activity (Fig. 4B). The V692G mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ entry in cells expressing constitutively active S361G and F643L mutants was exaggerated compare with wild-type (supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, the kinase negative G360S mutant exhibited prolonged membrane localization and sustained [Ca2+] similar to the C1 domain mutants. These data suggest that in addition to disruption of the C1 domain, a decrease or increase in its kinase activity ablates Cch-induced Ca2+ regulation in CHOhm1 cells. PKCγ Negatively Regulates TRPC Channels in Response to Cch—Cch induces Ca2+ influx through receptor-mediated Ca2+ channels such as TRPC channels (22Smyth J.T. Lemonnier L. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11712-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the hypothesis that PKCγ modulates TRPC channel activity to inhibit the Cch-induced Ca2+ entry, we examined the effect of various Ca2+ channel inhibitors on Ca2+ levels in cells expressing wild-type or G128D mutant PKCγ-DsRed. As shown in Fig. 5A, the t½ [Ca2+]i of G128D mutant was significantly longer than that of wild-type. Treatment with the TRPC channel inhibitors 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and SKF-96395 completely abolished the excessive Ca2+ entry in cells expressing the G128D mutant. Conversely, blocking the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger or the L-type Ca2+ channel with nifedipine and SEA0400, respectively, had no effect. These results suggest that the Cch-induced change in [Ca2+]i is mediated by TRPC channels. We next examined the effect of PKCγ on the Cch-induced Ca2+ response in HEK-293 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, cells that endogenously express muscarinic receptors. Similarly to CHOhm1 cells, wild-type, but not the G128D mutant, negatively regulated Ca2+ influx in both cell types (Fig. 5B). This result suggests that the negative regulation of [Ca2+]i by PKCγ likely occurs in neurons that endogenously express PKCγ and TRPC channels. Interestingly, although much of the data on Ca2+ responses in HEK-293 cells were similar to CHOhm1 and SH-SY5Y cells, Ca2+ oscillations were frequently observed in cells expressing wild-type but not the G128D mutant (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Ca2+ influx regulated by PKCγ likely depends on plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, especially TRPC channels. However, the G128D mutant lacks the ability to regulate these channels. A C1 Domain Mutant Fails to Phosphorylate TRPC3 Channel in Vivo—Among the TRPC subfamily, the TRPC3 channel is expressed predominantly in the brain, especially cerebellar Purkinje cells (23Mori Y.

Calcium Binding Proteins. 2007; 2: 60-72Google Scholar), which is rich in PKCγ. In addition, both TRPC3 channels and PKCγ are activated by DAG (25Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKCγ could phosphorylate the TRPC3 channel at the plasma membrane of Purkinje cells. In fact, PKCα has been reported to phosphorylate TRPC3 channels in vitro and in vivo (26Trebak M. Hempel N. Wedel B.J. Smyth J.T. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether the TRPC3 channel can be phosphorylated by PKCγ in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6A, significant phosphorylation of FLAG-TRPC3 by GST-PKCγ occurred in the presence of PS, DiC10, and Ca2+ and phosphorylation was abolished by the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X. Thus, PKCγ can directly phosphorylate TRPC3 in vitro. We next investigated wheth"

Here we show that MIF physically interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor in vitro and in vivo. This association was significantly reduced by a C81S mutation but not C57S or C60S mutations, suggesting that Cys81 is essential for the in vivo association between MIF and p53. This association also depended on Cys242 (and, to some extent, on Cys238) within the central DNA binding domain of p53. Ectopic expression of MIF, but not MIF(C81S), inhibited p53-mediated transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous MIF stimulated p53-mediated transcription. MIF inhibited p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, whereas the MIF(C81S) mutant, which is unable to physically associate with p53, had no effect. Consistent with these findings, confocal microscopy showed that MIF prevented p53 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We also demonstrated that MIF suppresses p53 activity by stabilizing the physical association between p53 and Mdm2. These results suggest that MIF physically associates with p53 and negatively regulates p53 function.

Recent studies have suggested that MIF contributes to tumorigenesis by suppressing the activity of p53 (3Hudson J.D. Shoaibi M.A. Maestro R. Carnero A. Hannon G.J. Beach D.H. J. Exp.

High levels of MIF expression have been found in human tumors, including melanomas, breast carcinomas, prostate cancer, and adenocarcinoma of the lung (5Meyer-Siegler K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6del Vecchio M.T. Tripodi S.A. Arcuri F. Pergola L. Hako L. Vatti R. Cintorino M. Prostate. 2000; 45: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). High levels of MIF also enhance tumor cell migration and the production of angiogenic factors (7Ogawa H. Nishihira J. Sato Y. Kondo M. Takahashi N. Oshima T. Todo S. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting that MIF is an important regulator of cell growth and apoptosis. A recent gene knock-out analysis demonstrated that MIF plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner (8Fingerle-Rowson G. Petrenko O. Metz C.N. Forsthuber T.G. Mitchell R. Huss R. Moll U. Muller W. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9354-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which MIF regulates p53 activity remained unknown. Several studies have suggested that MIF and thiol antioxidants are bridged through interchain disulfides (9Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.-Z. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol.

MIF exhibits a cysteine-dependent enzymatic oxidoreductase activity, and this activity is dependent on the redox-active conserved sequence motif (Cys57-Ala-Leu-Cys60) (11Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the conserved cysteine sequence motif Cys-X-X-Cys was reported to be critical for the macrophage-activating activities and JAB1-mediated activities of MIF (12Kleemann R. Hausser A. Geiger G. Mischke R. Burger-Kentischer A. Flieger O. Johannes F.J. Roger T. Calandra T. Kapurniotu A. Grell M. Finkelmeier D. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Thus, MIF could regulate p53 through direct interactions mediated by cysteine residues. p53 is tightly suppressed in nonstressed cells by Mdm2, which indirectly inhibits p53-dependent gene expression by ubiquitinating and degrading p53 (13Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 14Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). In addition, Mdm2 can prevent p53 transactivation through a direct interaction with the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53, blocking the interaction of p53 with the basal transcription machinery required for transactivation (15Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar, 16Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

To grasp how p53 is activated in response to stress-induced signals, extensive efforts have been made to identify molecules that can interfere with the interaction between p53 and Mdm2. Several proteins affect the p53-Mdm2 interaction by binding to p53 or Mdm2 (17Leung K.M. Po L.S. Tsang F.C. Siu W.Y. Lau A. Ho H.T. Poon R.Y.

A putative tumor suppressor, ING1b, stabilizes and activates p53 function through a direct interaction with the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53, probably by disrupting the interaction between p53 and Mdm2 (17Leung K.M.

ARF, the alternative reading frame product of the INK4a/ARF locus, binds Mdm2 and prevents Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation (19Kamijo T. Weber J.D. Zambetti G. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc.

In addition, p300 and retinoblastoma augment p53 stability by binding to the site adjacent to conserved region II, a highly acidic region of Mdm2 (18Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S. O'Connor D.J. Mittnacht S.

Therefore, one way to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the effect of MIF on p53 function is to analyze MIF as an intracellular regulator of Mdm2. Here we show that MIF physically binds to p53 in vivo and that this interaction requires the participation of cysteine residues present in each of these two proteins. Moreover, MIF negatively regulates p53 activity, probably by stabilizing the association between p53 and Mdm2. Reagents and Cell Culture—Anti-GST, anti-FLAG (M2), anti-β-actin, Alexa Fluor-594 anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit, and anti-histone (H2B) antibodies were described previously (22Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The anti-MIF, anti-Mdm2, anti-p53(DO-1), anti-p21, and anti-Bax, anti-histone H2B antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-HA antibody was kindly provided by Dr. S-C. Bae (Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea). 293T, HEK293, MCF7, U2OS, and HCT116 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (23Seong H.-A. Jung H. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12272-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Generation of Inducible MIF shRNA Cell Lines—For inducible knockdown of endogenous MIF expression, double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-TCGAGGACACCAACGTGCCCCGCGCTTCAAGAGAGCGCGGGGCACGTTGGTGTCTTTTTTA-3′, MIF sequence underlined) was cloned into the pSingle-tTS-shRNA vector (Clontech). HCT116 cells were transfected with pSingle-tTS-shRNA harboring MIF-specific shRNA or pSingle-tTS-shRNA empty vector using WelFect-Ex™ Plus (WelGENE, Daegu, Korea). Inducible MIF shRNA stable clones were screened in the presence of 450 μg/ml G418 until all control parental HCT116 cells died. Stable clones were isolated and treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma), a tetracycline analogue, for 72 h, and endogenous MIF knockdown was determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-MIF antibody. Plasmids and DNA Construction—The expression plasmids for wild-type p53 and its deletion derivatives were a kind gift from Dr. S-J Um (Sejong University, Seoul, Korea). To generate the p53(DBD) construct, PCR was performed using the following primers: forward primer (5′-GCGAATTCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACA-3′) containing an EcoRI site (underlined), and reverse primer (5′-GCCTCGAGGCGGAGATTCTCTTCCTC-3′) containing an XhoI site (underlined). The amplified PCR products were cut with EcoRI plus XhoI and cloned into a pFLAG-CMV2 vector using EcoRI plus SalI sites to generate the FLAG-p53(DBD). The six Cys to Ser p53(DBD) substitution mutants (C176S, C238S, C242S, C176S/C238S, C176S/C242S, and C238S/C242S) were generated by PCR. In brief, a human p53 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM000546) was used as the template for amplification with either the forward primer for p53(DBD) or the reverse primer for p53(DBD), in conjunction with one of the following mutant primers containing alterations in the nucleotide sequence of p53(DBD): for p53(DBD) Cys176 to Ser (C176S), sense 5′-GTGAGGCGCTCACCCCACCAT-3′, antisense 5′-ATGGTGGGGTGAGCGCCTCAC-3′; for p53(DBD) Cys238 to Ser (C238S), sense 5′-AACTACATGTCAAACAGTTCC-3′, antisense 5′-GGAACTGTTTGACATGTAGTT-3′; for p53(DBD) Cys242 to Ser (C242S), sense 5′-AACAGTTCCTCAATGGGCGGC-3′, antisense 5′-GCCGCCCATTGAGGAACTGTT-3′. To generate the double substitution mutant C176S/C238S, FLAG-C176S was used as the template, and the sense and antisense primers of C238S and p53(DBD) were used for PCR amplification. To generate the double substitution mutants C176S/C242S and C238S/C242S, PCR was carried out using FLAG-C176S and FLAG-C238S as templates in the presence of primers for C242S and p53(DBD). The identity of all of the PCR products was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analysis on both strands. In Vivo and in Vitro Binding Assay—Each plasmid DNA indicated under “Results” was transiently transfected into the indicated cells with WelFect-Ex™ Plus, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vivo binding assays were performed as described previously (23Seong H.-A. Jung H. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12272-12289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine the ability of p53 to bind to wild-type and mutant forms of MIF in vitro, p53 was translated in vitro using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system as directed by the manufacturer (Promega). In vitro-translated 35S-labeled p53 was incubated with unlabeled recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of MIF in the presence of 5 mm H2O2 at room temperature for 1 h, and then assessed by 8% nondenaturing PAGE as described previously (22Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RNA Interference Experiments—RNA interference experiments were performed using MIF-specific siRNAs. The sequences used were as follows: MIF-specific siRNA 1 (5′-ACACCAACGUGCCCCGCGCdTdT-3′) corresponding to a coding region (amino acids 7-13) of the human MIF (GenBank™ accession number NM002415); MIF-specific siRNA 2 (5′-CCUUCUGGUGGGGAGAAAUdTdT-3′) corresponding to a C-terminal region (nucleotides 427-445); MIF-specific siRNA 3 (5′-CAACUCCACCUUCGCCUAAdTdT-3′) corresponding toa3′-untranslated region (nucleotides 527-545); and a nonspecific control siRNA (5′-GCGCGGGGCACGUUGGUGUdTdT-3′), as described (24Seong H.-A.

Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractions—MCF7 cells (∼4 × 105 per 60-mm dish) transfected with the indicated expression vectors (wild-type and mutant forms of MIF) or a MIF-specific siRNA 1 were used for the preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions for immunoblot analyses, as described previously (22Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reporter Assays—Luciferase activity was monitored by using a p53-Luc reporter containing eight copies of the p53-responsive element derived from the p21 promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Y.-I. Yeom, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Taejon, Korea). MCF7 or U2OS cells were transiently transfected according to the WelFect-Ex™ Plus method with the reporter plasmids, along with the appropriate expression vectors as indicated. Luciferase activity was assessed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ubiquitination Assay—p53-null HCT116 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p53, wild-type, and mutant forms of MIF, MIF-specific siRNAs 1 and 2, and HA-tagged ubiquitin either alone or in combination. The cells were treated with 10 μg/ml MG132 (Calbiochem) for 4 h, harvested, and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), lysed in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 2% SDS, and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. p53 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p53 antibody and subjected to SDS-8% PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-HA antibody. Immunodepletion of MIF—HEK293 cell extracts were incubated with 4 μg of anti-MIF antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, and 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose were subsequently added and incubated for an additional 3 h at 4 °C. After immunodepletion twice with an anti-MIF antibody, aliquots of the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with an anti-MIF antibody to confirm the immunodepletion of MIF. The MIF-depleted extracts were mixed with recombinant GST alone, GST-MIF(WT), or GST-MIF(C81S) proteins (each 4 μg). The mixtures were then purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-p53 antibody to determine the complex formation between p53 and MIF. Apoptosis Assay—The apoptosis assay was performed as described previously (24Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). MCF7 cells undergoing apoptosis were quantified using the GFP system. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells visualized under a fluorescence microscope. FACS Analysis—MCF7 cells transiently expressing wild-type and mutant forms of MIF or MIF-specific siRNAs 1-3, together with transfectants expressing p53 or empty vector alone as controls, were washed with ice-cold PBS and then treated with 5FU for 30 h or with doxorubicin for 24 h. The trypsinized cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with a solution consisting of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma) in 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur-S system (BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—The indirect immunofluorescence method was described previously in detail (22Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Specimens were examined under a Leica Dmire2 confocal laser scanning microscope (Germany). MIF Directly Interacts with p53 in Mammalian Cells—To test whether MIF can associate with p53 in cells, we transiently expressed wild-type MIF in 293T cells as a FLAG-tagged fusion protein (FLAG-MIF) or expressed an empty vector (cytomegalovirus) as a control. The interactions of FLAG-MIF with endogenous p53 proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. MIF was detected in the p53 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1A). To verify the interaction of endogenous MIF with p53 in vivo, we next performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using MCF7 and HCT116 cell extracts. Endogenous p53 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the binding of endogenous MIF was subsequently analyzed using Western blotting with an anti-MIF antibody. Again, MIF was present in the p53 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1B, left panel). To examine whether MIF could bring down p53 in a reciprocal way, endogenous MIF was immunoprecipitated by anti-MIF antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-p53 antibody. The endogenous p53 was also detected in the MIF immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1B, right panel). These data demonstrate that MIF physically interacts with p53 in vivo. Formation of the MIF-p53 Complex Requires the Cysteine Residue (Cys81) of MIF—To investigate whether the cysteine residues of MIF are necessary for the formation of the MIF-p53 complex, we transiently cotransfected 293T cells with GST-tagged wild-type MIF and its mutants, MIF(C57S), MIF(C60S), and MIF(C81S), together with FLAG-tagged wild-type p53. The expression of the MIF mutants MIF(C57S) and MIF(C60S) did not notably influence the association between MIF and p53, whereas the MIF(C81S) mutant dramatically decreased the complex formation (Fig. 2A). We also used nondenaturing PAGE to analyze the association of purified, recombinant MIF proteins with p53 that was translated in vitro. When the 35S-labeled p53 was incubated in the presence of wild-type MIF and its mutants MIF(C57S) and MIF(C60S), the mobility clearly shifted relative to incubation in the absence of MIF (Fig. 2B, 1st lane versus 2nd to 4th lanes). In contrast, the mobility shift was not observed when 35S-labeled p53 was incubated with MIF(C81S) (Fig. 2B, 5th lane). This was further confirmed by measuring the binding capacity of recombinant MIF(C81S) with endogenous p53 in MIF-depleted extracts. A weak interaction between MIF(C81S) and p53 that was observed in normal cell extracts had completely disappeared in MIF-depleted extracts (Fig. 2C), providing additional evidence of a physical association between MIF and p53 through Cys81. As a control, the efficiency of depletion was shown to be 100% by immunoblotting with an anti-MIF antibody (Fig. 2C, bottom panels). To address the question of whether MIF specifically binds to p53 through Cys81, we also employed an inducible MIF shRNA system to deplete the expression of endogenous MIF in HCT116 cells. A similar result was also observed in a stable system for tetracycline-inducible expression of MIF shRNA (Fig. 2D, right panel). As a control, HCT116 cells stably expressing pSingle-tTS-shRNA vector harboring MIF-specific shRNA (MIF shRNA) showed a doxycycline-dependent RNA interference effect on the endogenous MIF silencing (Fig. 2D, right bottom panel), whereas stable HCT116 cells containing the empty vector alone (Vector Laboratories) showed no effect on the expression of endogenous MIF in the presence or absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2D, left upper and right bottom panels). These observations led us to investigate the effect of the redox status on the formation of the endogenous MIF-p53 complex in cells. The reductants DTT and β-mercaptoethanol considerably decreased the amount of coprecipitated MIF, whereas H2O2, an oxidant, did not (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the interaction of MIF with p53 in vivo is redox-dependent. These data strongly suggest that the in vivo association of MIF and p53 requires the participation of cysteine residues. Determination of the MIF Interaction Domain of p53—To map the domain(s) within p53 required for its association with MIF, we generated a set of six p53 deletion mutants (Fig. 3A, upper panel), and we examined their ability to interact with MIF using in vivo binding assays in 293T cells. MIF interacted with wild-type p53, p53(44/393), p53(44/387), p53(319/393), and p53(DBD) but not with p53(319/360) and p53(TAD) (Fig. 3A, lower panel). These results indicate that the interaction of MIF with p53 is mediated via the DNA binding domain (DBD) within residues 113-290. The basic domain within residues 363-393 served as a secondary interaction domain. The central DBD contains all the cysteine residues of p53. Three cysteine residues in murine p53 (Cys173, Cys235, and Cys239) are essential for the suppression of transformation, transactivation, and in vitro DNA binding (28Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of specific cysteines in MIF binding, we initially generated three human p53(DBD) substitution mutants, C176S, C238S, and C242S (Fig. 3B), and examined their ability to interact with MIF. MIF strongly interacted with the wild-type p53(DBD) and the C176S mutant but not with the C242S mutant (Fig. 3C, upper left panel). In addition, cells expressing the C238S mutant formed less of the complex than wild-type p53(DBD). This suggests that Cys238 of p53, like Cys242, potentially plays a role in the association of p53 with MIF, although to a somewhat lesser extent. To further examine the roles of Cys238 and Cys242 of the DBD domain of p53 in its association with MIF, we generated three p53(DBD) double substitution mutants, C176S/C238S, C176S/C242S, and C238S/C242S, and examined their binding properties in the in vivo binding assay. The expression of C176S/C242S or C238S/C242S dramatically inhibited complex formation between MIF and p53, as compared with the expression of the control p53(DBD) (Fig. 3C, upper right panel). These results suggest that both Cys238 and Cys242 of the DBD domain of p53 are important for its association with MIF; however, Cys242 had a stronger effect on formation of the complex between MIF and p53 than Cys238. We further analyzed whether the Cys81 of MIF and Cys242 (and Cys238) of p53 play a critical role in the association of MIF with p53 using an in vivo binding assay. As expected, expression of MIF(C81S) strongly inhibited the association in the presence of FLAG-C242S, whereas wild-type MIF, MIF(C57S), and MIF(C60S) did not modulate the association of the proteins (Fig. 3C, lower panel). Together, these results strongly suggest that MIF binds to p53 through Cys81 of MIF and Cys242 (and Cys238) of p53. MIF-p53 Association Is Regulated by 5FU and Doxorubicin—5FU is an anti-metabolite that inhibits thymidylate synthase and is important for the apoptotic response (29Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar); it is an important inducer of 53-mediated apoptosis. Doxorubicin induces cell cycle arrest by introducing double-stranded DNA breaks (30Kaeser M.D. Pebernard S. Iggo R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7598-7605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We next examined whether 5FU and doxorubicin can influence MIF-p53 complex formation in cells. Upon 5FU treatment, the association between endogenous MIF and p53 was considerably decreased compared with control cells not treated with 5FU (Fig. 4, left panel). Similarly, doxorubicin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the association between endogenous MIF and p53 (Fig. 4, right panel). This result was also confirmed by a reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment in which endogenous MIF was immunoprecipitated by anti-MIF antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-p53 antibody (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that the interaction between MIF and p53 appears to be dependent on p53 stimulation by 5FU or doxorubicin. MIF Suppresses p53-mediated Transcription—To identify the physiological role of the MIF-p53 complex, we first analyzed the effect of MIF on p53-mediated transcription. We transiently transfected MCF7 and U2OS cells with increasing amounts of MIF, together with a p53-Luc reporter plasmid, in the presence or absence of 5FU. The addition of MIF inhibited the p53-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), suggesting that MIF is a negative regulator of p53 activity. In contrast, expression of MIF alone, as a control, had no effect on the regulation of p53-mediated transcription. We also examined the effect of MIF-specific siRNAs on p53-mediated transcription in cells. The transfection of the MIF-specific siRNAs resulted in a significant increase of p53-mediated transcription that was proportional to the amount of MIF-specific siRNAs transfected (Fig. 5B, upper panel). A similar trend was also observed in p53-null HCT116 and H1299 cells transfected with the MIF-specific siRNA, supporting that the inhibitory effect of MIF on p53-mediated transcription is truly p53-dependent (Fig. 5B, lower panel). To further examine whether the MIF-induced inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity is dependent on its direct interaction with p53, we determined the effect of MIF mutants on p53-mediated transcription in MCF7 and U2OS cells. Expression of MIF(C81S) had little effect on p53-mediated transcription, whereas expression of wild-type MIF, MIF(C57S), and MIF(C60S) substantially decreased p53-mediated transcription to a similar extent in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). We extended this analysis to investigate the effect of MIF on p53 signaling. Overexpression of MIF decreased the expression of p53 target genes, including p53, p21, and BAX, whose genes are normally up-regulated by p53 signals, in cells tested (Fig. 5D); however, overexpression of MIF(C81S) did not have this effect. To further confirm the negative role of MIF in p53 signaling, we generated a stable system for tetracycline-inducible expression of MIF shRNA in HCT116 cells (MIF shRNA) and analyzed them for p53-induced gene expression. Compared with the expression in control HCT116 cells stably expressing the empty vector alone (Vector Laboratories), knockdown of endogenous MIF by doxycycline treatment significantly increased the expression of p53, p21, MDM2, and BAX (Fig. 5E, left panel). MIF-knockdown cells showed a lower induction of p53 target genes compared with parental HCT116 cells (parental cells) treated with 5FU that induces p53-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5E, left panel, lane 4 versus lane 5). We observed similar results in HCT116 cells transiently transfected with MIF-specif"
https://openalex.org/W2047166991,"Protein sumoylation is a regulated process that is important for the health of human and yeast cells. In budding yeast, a subset of sumoylated proteins is targeted for ubiquitination by a conserved heterodimeric ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, Slx5-Slx8, which is needed to suppress the accumulation of high molecular weight small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugates. Structure-function analysis indicates that the Slx5-Slx8 complex contains multiple SUMO-binding domains that are collectively required for in vivo function. To determine the specificity of Slx5-Slx8, we assayed its Ub ligase activity using sumoylated Siz2 as an in vitro substrate. In contrast to unsumoylated or multisumoylated Siz2, substrates containing poly-SUMO conjugates were efficiently ubiquitinated by Slx5-Slx8. Although Siz2 itself was ubiquitinated, the bulk of the Ub was conjugated to SUMO residues. Slx5-Slx8 primarily mono-ubiquitinated the N-terminal SUMO moiety of the chain. These data indicate that the Slx5-Slx8 Ub ligase is stimulated by poly-SUMO conjugates and that it can ubiquitinate a poly-SUMO chain."
https://openalex.org/W1980700716,"Unregulated activities of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family have been implicated in primary and metastatic tumor growth, angiogenesis, and pathological degradation of extracellular matrix components, such as collagen and laminin. However, clinical trials with small molecule MMP inhibitors have been largely unsuccessful, with a lack of selectivity considered particularly problematic. Enhanced selectivity could be achieved by taking advantage of differences in substrate secondary binding sites (exosites) within the MMP family. In this study, triple-helical substrates and triple-helical transition state analog inhibitors have been utilized to dissect the roles of potential exosites in MMP-9 collagenolytic behavior. Substrate and inhibitor sequences were based on either the α1(V)436–450 collagen region, which is hydrolyzed at the Gly ↓ Val bond selectively by MMP-2 and MMP-9, or the Gly ↓ Leu cleavage site within the consensus interstitial collagen sequence α1(I–III)769–783, which is hydrolyzed by MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP. Exosites within the MMP-9 fibronectin II inserts were found to be critical for interactions with type V collagen model substrates and inhibitors and to participate in interactions with an interstitial (types I–III) collagen model inhibitor. A triple-helical peptide incorporating a fibronectin II insert-binding sequence was constructed and found to selectively inhibit MMP-9 type V collagen-based activities compared with interstitial collagen-based activities.

A number of proteases have been described as exhibiting collagenolytic behavior, requiring that they catalyze the hydrolysis of the collagen triple helix (1Song F. Wisithphrom K. Zhou J. Windsor L.J. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 3100-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied are the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography; CAT, catalytic; HPX, hemopexin; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; FN, fibronectin; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; APMA, 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate; Flp, (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Dnp, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; Mca, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl; Hyp, 4-hydroxy-l-proline; THP, triple-helical peptide; THPI, THP inhibitor; fTHP, fluorogenic THP. MMPs that catalyze the hydrolysis of one or more of the interstitial collagens (types I–III) within their triple-helical domain include the secreted proteases MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-13 and the membrane-bound proteases MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP (5McCawley L.J.

In the cases of MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13, MT1-MMP, and MT2-MMP, efficient collagenolytic activity in the isolated enzyme requires both the catalytic (CAT) and hemopexin (HPX)-like domains (Fig. 1) (9Clark I.N.

Pereira H.M. Jacchieri S. Brentani R.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or by allowing for the proper orientation of the CAT and HPX domains (16Iyer S. Visse R. Nagase H. Acharya K.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The “gelatinase” members of the MMP family (MMP-2 and MMP-9) incorporate three fibronectin type II (FN II) inserts within their CAT domains (Fig. 1). The FN II inserts possess binding sites for type I collagen, and thus are alternatively called the collagen-binding domains (17Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 392: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The FN II inserts, along with the CAT and HPX-like domains, contribute to MMP-2 collagenolytic activity (19Patterson M.L. Atkinson S.J. Knäuper V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although the domains that participate in collagenolysis have been identified, little is known about the mechanism by which these domains collaborate to facilitate collagenolysis nor the specific sites that are necessary for the process. Collagenolysis may be divided into several steps as follows: (a) binding of the triple helix; (b) proper orientation of the MMP domains; (c) unwinding of the triple helix and/or trapping of relaxed triple-helical backbones; (d) binding of individual substrate strands to the active site; and (e) rapid sequential processing of all three strands (20Minond D.

One approach to identify MMP residues and regions that participate in the individual collagenolytic steps is to use triple-helical substrates in combination with site-specific or domain mutagenesis (14Hurst D.R.

This study has utilized triple-helical substrates and inhibitors to dissect the role of the FN II inserts in triple-helical peptidase activity. Three forms of MMP-9 have been examined as follows: wild-type MMP-9, MMP-9 with the HPX-like domain deleted (MMP-9 CAT), and MMP-9 with the HPX-like domain and FN II inserts deleted (MMP-9 CAT-FN). MMP-2 and MMP-1 (with and without the HPX-like domain) have also been studied to provide a comparison with MMP-9. The triple-helical substrates are derived from sequences hydrolyzed by all collagenolytic MMPs (23Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Nagase H. Fields G.B.

The triple-helical inhibitors have sequences analogous to the substrates, except that a phosphinate moiety replaces the scissile bond and creates a transition state analog. We have recently described a selective MMP-2/MMP-9 triple-helical inhibitor that incorporates GlyΨ{PO2H-CH2}Val (26Lauer-Fields J.L. Brew K. Whitehead J.K. Li S. Hammer R.P. Fields G.B. J. Am. Chem.

A second, more general collagenolytic MMP triple-helical inhibitor, containing GlyΨ{PO2H-CH2}Leu, is described for the first time here. Activity has been examined as a function of triple-helical content to evaluate the role of triple helicity in MMP behaviors. Finally, the effects of a recently described inhibitor that binds to the MMP-2 FN II insert on different MMP-2 and MMP-9 triple-helical peptidase activities have been compared. All standard chemicals were peptide synthesis or molecular biology grade and purchased from Fisher.

Eluants were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B). The elution gradient was 10–70% B in 60 min with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Detection was at λ = 220 nm. Fractions from analytical RP-HPLC were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) on a Bruker Proflex III instrument with XMASS software. α1(I–III)GlyΨ{PO2H-CH2}Leu THPI gave [M + H]+ 3921.4 Da (theoretical 3920.2 Da).

Peptide Purification—For α1(I–III)GlyΨ{PO2H-CH2}Leu THPI, semi-preparative RP-HPLC was performed on a Waters Deltaprep System using a Vydac C18 RP column (15-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, 200 × 25 mm) at a flow rate of 10.0 ml/min. Eluants were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B). The elution gradient was 10–30% B in 100 min, with detection at λ = 220 nm. Isolated fractions were analyzed by PDA RP-HPLC. PDA RP-HPLC was performed on a Waters 625 pump with a model 996 diode array detector controlled by Millennium software, using a Vydac C18 RP column (5-mm particle size, 120-Å pore size, 250 × 4.6 mm) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.

CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded over the range λ = 190–250 nm on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. Thermal transition curves were obtained by recording the molar ellipticity ([Θ]) at λ = 225 nm, whereas the temperature was continuously increased in the range of 5–95 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min. Temperature was controlled using a JASCO PFD-425S temperature control unit. For samples exhibiting sigmoidal melting curves, the inflection point in the transition region (first derivative) is defined as the melting temperature (Tm).

After activation, MMP-3(Δ248–460) was completely removed from MMP-1 by affinity chromatography using an anti-MMP-3 IgG Affi-Gel 10 column. Pro-MMP-3 was activated by reacting with 5 μg/ml chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. Chymotrypsin was inactivated with 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Pro-MMP-2 was purified from the culture medium of human uterine cervical fibroblasts (41Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem.

Recombinant pro-MMP-9 was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA) and activated with 1 mm APMA for 1 h at 37 °C. Recombinant MMP-9 with the linker and the C-terminal HPX-like domain deleted (MMP-9 residues 107–443; designated MMP-9 CAT) was expressed in E. coli in the active form with Phe107 at the N terminus as described (42Hamze A.B.

The concentrations of active MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 were determined by titration with recombinant TIMP-1 or N-TIMP-1 over a concentration range of 0.1–3 μg/ml. Pro-MMP-1(Δ243–450) was expressed in E. coli using the expression vector pET3a (Novagen), folded from inclusion bodies and purified as described previously (43Suzuki K. Kan C.-C. Huang W. Gehring M.R. Brew K. Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The zymogen was activated as described above for the full-length pro-MMP-1. Active site titrations utilized either Knight SSP or NFF-3 as substrate (28Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Peptide Kinetic Assays—Substrate stock solutions were prepared at various concentrations in EAB buffer (50 mm Tricine, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5). MMP assays were conducted in EAB buffer by incubating a range of substrate concentrations (0.7–90 μm) with 2–5 nm enzyme at 25 °C. Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax Gemini EM dual-scanning microplate spectrofluorometer using λexcitation = 324 nm and λemission = 393 nm. Rates of hydrolysis were obtained from plots of fluorescence versus time, using data points from only the linear portion of the hydrolysis curve. The slope from these plots was divided by the fluorescence change corresponding to complete hydrolysis and then multiplied by the substrate concentration to obtain rates of hydrolysis in units of micromolar/s. Kinetic parameters were evaluated by Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, and Hanes-Woolf analyses, as well as by a nonlinear regression, one-site hyperbolic binding model with SigmaPlot software. Gelatin Assay—DQ™ bovine skin type I gelatin (fluorescein-conjugated) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fluorescein-labeled pig skin type A gelatin was prepared by dissolving 10 mg/ml gelatin in 0.2 m carbonate buffer (pH 9.0), incubating with a ∼30-fold excess of fluorescein isothiocyanate overnight at room temperature, and dialyzing. Stock solutions of labeled gelatins were prepared in EAB buffer. MMP assays were conducted in EAB buffer by incubating a range of gelatin concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μg/ml) with 1.0 nm enzyme. Fluorescence was measured using λexcitation = 485 nm and λemission = 535 nm. Rates of hydrolysis were obtained as described above. Inhibition Kinetic Studies—Peptide substrates and inhibitors were dissolved in TSB buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5). 1–2 nm enzyme was incubated with varying concentrations of inhibitors for 2 h at room temperature. Residual enzyme activity was monitored by adding 0.1 volume of Knight SSP to produce a final concentration of <0.1 KM. Initial velocity rates were determined from the first 20 min of hydrolysis when product release is linear with time. Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax Gemini EM dual-scanning microplate spectrofluorometer using λexcitation = 324 nm and λemission = 393 nm. Apparent Ki values were calculated using Equations 1 and 2, vi/vo={Et−It−Ki(app)+((Et−It−Ki(app))2+4EtKi(app))0.5}/2Et(Eq. 1) Ki(app)=Ki({At+KM}/KM)(Eq. 2) where It is the total inhibitor concentration; Et is the total enzyme concentration; At is the total substrate concentration; vo is the activity in the absence of inhibitor; and KM is the Michaelis constant. In our assays the value of Et/Kappi does not exceed 100 so that the inhibitor is distributed in both free and bound forms, and Kappi can be calculated by fitting inhibition data to Equation 1. Because the substrate concentration is less than KM/10, Kappi values are insignificantly different from true Ki values. In cases where weak inhibition occurred, Kappi values were calculated using vi = vo/(1 + It/Kappi). It should be noted that the diastereomers present in α1(I–III)GlyΨ{PO2H-CH2}Leu THPI were not separable by RP-HPLC. Because the S stereoisomer is likely a better inhibitor than the R stereoisomer (26Lauer-Fields J.L. Brew K. Whitehead J.K. Li S. Hammer R.P. Fields G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 10408-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the true Ki values for the S form are likely lower than illustrated here. Triple-helical Substrates and Transition State Analogs—Two triple-helical substrates and two triple-helical transition state analog inhibitors were used as probes of MMP-9 function.

In this study their respective contributions toward formation of dolichols in Coluria geoides hairy root culture were estimated using in vivo labeling with 13C-labeled glucose as a general precursor. NMR and mass spectrometry showed that both the MVA and MEP pathways were the sources of isopentenyl diphosphate incorporated into polyisoprenoid chains. The involvement of the MEP pathway was found to be substantial at the initiation stage of dolichol chain synthesis, but it was virtually nil at the terminal steps; statistically, 6–8 isoprene units within the dolichol molecule (i.e. 40–50% of the total) were derived from the MEP pathway. These results were further verified by incorporation of [5-2H]mevalonate or [5,5-2H2]deoxyxylulose into dolichols as well as by the observed decreased accumulation of dolichols upon treatment with mevinolin or fosmidomycin, selective inhibitors of either pathway. The presented data indicate that the synthesis of dolichols in C. geoides roots involves a continuous exchange of intermediates between the MVA and MEP pathways. According to our model, oligoprenyl diphosphate chains of a length not exceeding 13 isoprene units are synthesized in plastids from isopentenyl diphosphate derived from both the MEP and MVA pathways, and then are completed in the cytoplasm with several units derived solely from the MVA pathway.

Polyisoprenoid alcohols together with sterols and quinone side chains constitute three main branches of terpene products originating from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) 4The abbreviations used are: FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; MVA, mevalonate; MEP, methylerythritol phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethyl allyl diphosphate; Dol-n, dolichol composed of n isoprenoid units; HPLC/ESI-MS, high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; Dol, dolichol; DX, deoxyxylulose. 4The abbreviations used are: FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; MVA, mevalonate; MEP, methylerythritol phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethyl allyl diphosphate; Dol-n, dolichol composed of n isoprenoid units; HPLC/ESI-MS, high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; Dol, dolichol; DX, deoxyxylulose.

These linear five-carbon unit polymers are divided into two groups, i.e. polyprenols and dolichols, according to the hydrogenation status of the α-terminal isoprene unit (dolichol structure is shown in Fig. 1). In cells, polyprenols and dolichols are always found as mixtures of prenologues, and data collected so far show polyprenols to be typical for bacteria and plants, whereas dolichols are generally attributed to animals and yeast (2Hemming F.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it should be remembered that dolichols are the predominant form in some plant organs like roots (3Skorupinska-Tudek K. Bienkowski T. Olszowska O. Furmanowa M. Chojnacki T. Danikiewicz W. Swiezewska E. Lipids. 2003; 38: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Data on the occurrence and functions of polyisoprenoids are summarized in recently published reviews (4Rezanka T. Votruba J. J. Chromatogr. A. 2001; 936: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Swiezewska E. Danikiewicz W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 235-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The formation of the polyisoprenoid chain, starting from the ω-end of the molecule (Fig. 1), proceeds in a biphasic manner with farnesyl-diphosphate synthase responsible for the synthesis of the all-trans-FPP (three isoprene units of ω-t2 structure, t stands for trans-isoprene unit), and its further elongation by cis-prenyltransferase. The latter enzyme, cloned from several prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (see Refs. 6Liang P.-H. Ko T.-P. Wang A. H.-J. Eur. J.

Rattanapittayaporn A. Koyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4671-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), utilizes isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) for elongation of FPP up to the desired chain length, thus producing a family of polyprenyl diphosphates (n isoprene units of ω-t2-cn-3 structure, c stands for cis-isoprene unit), which are subsequently converted to polyprenols or dolichols according to the “tissue-specific requirements” by a still unknown mechanism. In plant cells two pathways are known to produce IPP utilized by numerous enzymes to finally give more than 50,000 different isoprenoid structures, the mevalonate pathway (MVA) and the mevalonate-independent methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP) (for reviews, see Refs. 11Rohmer M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 12Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Arigoni D. Rohdisch F. Cell. Mol.

Both pathways are compartmentalized as follows: the MVA in the cytoplasm to provide sterols, the many sesquiterpenes, and the prenyl chains of ubiquinones, and the MEP one in the plastids giving hemi-, mono-, and diterpenes, carotenoids, and the side chain of plastoquinone. Although both pathways are thought to operate independently under normal conditions, interactions between them have been reported repeatedly. As a result of the exchange of intermediates derived from both pathways, “mixed origin” isoprenoids are described (reviewed in Ref. 12Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Arigoni D. Rohdisch F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1401-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). More recently, the potential for the cross-talk between the MEP and MVA pathways has been directly proven by genetic modifications of pathway-specific enzymes and by application of pathway-specific inhibitors, namely mevinolin (14Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshua H. Harris E. Patchett A. Monaghan R. Currie S. Stapley E. Albers-Schonberg G. Hensens O. Hirshfield J. Hoogsteen K. Liesch J. Springer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar), also referred to as lovastatin, a highly specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in the MVA pathway, and fosmidomycin (15Kuzuyama T. Shimizu T. Takahashi S. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 7913-7916Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase in the MEP pathway. Both inhibitors have recently been used to perturb biosynthetic flux in hairy roots (16Yamazaki Y. Kitajima M. Arita M. Takayama H. Sudo H. Yamazaki M. Aimi N. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Ge X. Wu J. Plant Sci. 2005; 168: 487-491Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The involvement of both pathways leading to the formation of a studied isoprenoid compound is most often estimated by the application of specifically labeled [13C]glucose. A pathway-specific pattern of 13C label within the isoprenoid residues (Fig. 2) allows their origins via the MEP or MVA route to be discerned. Using [3H]mevalonate, it has been shown that in plants mainly cis-polyisoprenoid alcohols are synthesized via the MVA pathway (18Gough D.P. Hemming F.W. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Swiezewska E. Thelin A. Dallner G. Andersson B. Ernster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Sagami H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) might be the indication of their MEP and MVA origin, respectively. On the other hand, the MEP pathway has been found to contribute significantly to the synthesis of solanesol, an all-trans-pren-9 (26Fukusaki E. Takeno S. Bamba T. Okumoto H. Katto H. Kajiyama S. Kobayashi A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 1988-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas the solanesyl-like side chains of ubiquinone turned out to be synthesized from IPP derived from the MVA pathway (27Disch A. Hemmerlin A. Bach T.J. Rohmer M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A hairy root culture of Coluria geoides was established for eugenol production (28Olszowska O. Alferman A.W. Furmanowa M. Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult. 1996; 45: 273-276Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar); and because it also produces dolichols, it could be a useful model for studies of the early steps of dolichol biosynthesis in plants. The recently developed HPLC/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry methods (3Skorupinska-Tudek K. Bienkowski T. Olszowska O. Furmanowa M. Chojnacki T. Danikiewicz W. Swiezewska E. Lipids. 2003; 38: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) should greatly facilitate precise investigation of their structure. Despite many efforts, the biosynthetic origin of polyisoprenoid alcohols in plants remains unclear. Therefore, we have decided to analyze which pathway is the source of IPP built into dolichol. Here we report that both pathways are involved in the biosynthesis of dolichols in hairy roots of C. geoides. The ω-terminal isoprene unit and several subsequent ones are synthesized with an involvement of both the MEP and MVA pathways, in contrast to the very last α-terminal and a few preceding units, where contribution of the MEP pathway is negligible. According to our MS data, on average 6–8 isoprene units per dolichol molecule (ranging from 14 to 18 isoprene units) are formed in the MEP-dependent manner. A model is discussed, suggesting spatial regulation of dolichol synthesis and a unidirectional influx of IPP into plastids. Chemicals and Isotope-labeled Compounds—[1-13C]Glucose (99%), [1,6-13C2]glucose (99 and 97%), and [U-13C6]glucose (99%), together with C62H6 (2H 99.5%) were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA); the inhibitors mevinolin and fosmidomycin were obtained from Merck and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. (RS)-[5-2H]Mevalonate was prepared according to Ref. 29Keller R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12053-12059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar using NaB[2H]4 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA). 1-Deoxy-[5,5-2H2]d-xylulose was synthesized as described earlier (30Meyer O. Hoeffler J.F. Grosdemange-Billiard C. Rohmer M. Tetrahedron. 2004; 60: 12153-12162Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All dolichol and polyprenol standards were from the Collection of Polyprenols (Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland). Chromatographic materials were from Merck and HPLC solvents from Baker B.V. (Deventer, Holland). Plant Material, Labeling Experiments, and Analysis of [13C]Polyisoprenoids—Hairy roots of C. geoides were cultivated in liquid medium (modified B5 medium containing 0.75% glucose) for 21 days (logarithmic growth stage) in darkness at 22 °C on a rotary shaker at 105 rpm (3Skorupinska-Tudek K. Bienkowski T. Olszowska O. Furmanowa M. Chojnacki T. Danikiewicz W. Swiezewska E. Lipids. 2003; 38: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All the biosynthetic precursors were added to the medium from the beginning of culture growth, and labeling was continued for 3 weeks. For NMR measurements the medium contained a mixture of natural abundance glucose (1.1% 13C) and [1-13C]glucose (99% 13C) at a 9:1 ratio (w/w). The maximal possible 13C abundance in the products was thus 5.4% (see “Results”). For mass spectrometry either [13C]glucose alone or, when indicated, native glucose supplemented with [5-2H]mevalonate (3.9 mg/flask) or 1-deoxy-[5,5-2H2]xylulose (4.6 mg/flask) was used. For inhibitor studies regular medium was supplemented either with mevinolin (30 μm) or fosmidomycin (100 μm) for the last 3 days of the culture, and no symptoms of toxicity were observed during these treatments. Two independent feeding experiments were carried out, each performed in duplicate. Non-saponifiable lipids obtained from dried hairy roots were purified chromatographically as described earlier (3Skorupinska-Tudek K. Bienkowski T. Olszowska O. Furmanowa M. Chojnacki T. Danikiewicz W. Swiezewska E. Lipids. 2003; 38: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For NMR analysis the dolichol-enriched fraction eluted from the silica gel column was further subjected to flash chromatography on RP-18 Lichroprep gel suspended in methanol. Pure dolichol mixture was eluted with acetone. NMR Analysis—1H and 13C NMR spectra of metabolically 13C-labeled dolichols (7 mm) were obtained with a Varian INOVA 400 MHz (Palo Alto, CA) spectrometer at 25 °C in C62H6. Two-dimensional {1H,13C} gradient heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments (31Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem.

One-dimensional 13C experiment was performed with 64 K data points and a spectral width of 25 kHz in one-dimensional proton-decoupled mode. The measurement was carefully calibrated to achieve integrals for quantitative analysis. For CH2 and CH3 carbons of dolichol, T1 was measured yielding values between 1.1 and 2.7 s. The pulse sequence was optimized according to the literature (34Canet D. J. Magn. Reson. 1976; 23: 361-364Google Scholar, 35Freeman R. Hill H.D.W. Kaptein R. J. Magn. Reson. 1972; 7: 327-329Google Scholar); delay of 5.0 s, pulse width of 90°, and acquisition time of 0.2 s were applied avoiding nuclear Overhauser effects and presaturation. One hundred and twenty thousand scans (168 h) were collected yielding S/N = 130. Spectra were calibrated against the chemical shift of benzene in 13C spectra (128.0 ppm). Assignment of all 13C NMR signals (Table 2, for sequential numbering of carbon atoms, and see also supplemental Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 1) was done by combined use of two-dimensional {1H,13C} gradient heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra and literature data (36Tanaka Y. Sato H. Kageyu A. Tomita T. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Four residual signals were assigned to the traces of the organic solvent used for dolichol isolation, n-hexane (δ(C-α H3), 14.4 ppm; δ(C-β H2), 23.1 ppm, and δ(C-γ H2), 32.3 ppm), and to traces of “grease” accumulated during sample preparation (δ(CH2), 30.2 ppm) as confirmed with 1H,13C correlation spectra, whereas two low intensity signals (δ 77.6 and 29.5 ppm) remained unassigned.TABLE 2Isotopic abundances in dolichol 13C NMR spectrum Isotopic abundance of [1-13C]glucose used was 10.9% and thus maximal possible abundance was 5.4%, see “Results.” Numbering of carbon atom positions is given in Fig. 2.

Briefly, when indicated potassium acetate dissolved in solvent B was introduced post-column by a syringe pump (flow rate 5 μl/min) through a T union into the LC flow before entering the mass spectrometer instead of the sodium salt. For statistical calculations, all the m/z data were normalized for [M + Na]+ pseudomolecular ions. Because in all measurements only singly charged dolichol pseudomolecular ions were observed, the values of m/z were considered as molecular masses (in daltons) of pseudomolecular ions (adducts with sodium or potassium cations, as indicated). Analysis of MS Spectra, Modeling of the Theoretical Envelope of MS Spectra—The theoretical distribution of isoptomers, Ψ(M), so-called “theoretical MS spectra,” is mathematically given by a binomial distribution describing the probability of k successes (i.e. number of 13C atoms replacing 12C ones) in a hypothetical experiment of N = n × z tries, i.e. synthesis of Dol-n consisting of n isoprene units, each unit containing “z” carbon atoms which, theoretically, might be 13C-enriched (see the Table 1) with the unitary probability of success, p, according to Equation 1, ψ(M)=ψ(Mmi,n+k)=(n×zk)pk(1−p)n×z−k (Eq. 1) where Mmi,n is the mass of monoisotopic [12C]Dol-n; a binomial coefficient is given by Equation 2, (Nk)=N!k!(N−k)! (Eq. 2) and p is the probability of labeling of the specified carbon atom, which depends on the feeding conditions (summarized in Table 1). For the statistical analysis, the isotopomer distributions calculated for [1-13C]glucose and [1,6-13C2]glucose experiments were additionally corrected for the natural 1.1% 13C abundance at “nonenriched” positions (cf. Fig. 2).TABLE 1Probability of 13C labeling of specified carbon atoms within an isoprene unit synthesized via the MEP or the MVA pathway For isoprene units obtained from [1-13C]- and [1,6-13C2]glucose feeding, two types of carbon atoms, labeled with different probabilities (p), are expected, unlike for native and [U-13C6]glucose-derived ones, where all carbon atoms are labeled with equal probability.

The values were estimated with the standard deviation 0.1–0.3 Da. Meta-analysis of MS Spectra, Linear Regression Analysis— The values of the estimated average molecular masses of dolichols were used to analyze the trends of the increase of dolichol molecular mass using two alternative linear regression procedures. In the first linear regression procedure, the average molecular masses of dolichols, M(n,i), were analyzed as a function of the number of the isoprene units in the dolichol molecule, n, according to Equation 3, M(n,i)=Dol0+n×m(i) (Eq. 3) Thus, the average molecular mass of a dolichol molecule, consisting of n isoprene units M(n,i), is the sum of the masses of all the isoprenoid units, n × m(i), and the intercept, called Dol0, which represents the mass difference obtained by subtraction of the mass of n repeating C5H8 units from the total mass of the Dol-n pseudomolecular ion [MDol-n + Na]+ (see the chemical formula below Table 3). It is also worth stressing that Dol0 contains no carbon atoms and consequently its mass cannot be dependent on feeding conditions. These calculations were performed separately for all the feeding conditions, enumerated by index i, and resulted in two sets of parameters, i.e. slopes m(i), which correspond to the average molecular mass of the isoprenoid unit specific for a given feeding experiment, and intercepts, Dol0. This approach permitted a qualitative estimation of the involvement of the metabolic pathways in the synthesis of individual isoprene units.TABLE 3Expected and experimental values of molecular masses and molecular mass enrichment of isoprene unitGlucoseIsoprene unit (C5H8) (Da)Dol0 (Da)aDol0 represents the mass difference obtained by subtraction of the mass of n repeating C5H8 units from the total mass of the Dol-n pseudomolecular ion [MDol-n + Na]+ and corresponds to the sum of masses of atoms highlighted in bold: [H(C5H8)n-1-CH2-CH(CH3)-CHH-CHH-OH · Na]+Molecular massMolecular mass enrichmentExpectedExperimentalExpectedExperimentalExpectedExperimentalMVAMEPMVAMEPNonlabeled68.0868.08 ± 0.050043.0443.1[1-13C]Glucose69.5769.0669.32 ± 0.091.490.981.24 ± 0.0941.4[1,6-13C2]Glucose71.0770.0671.17 ± 0.212.991.983.09 ± 0.2133.7[U-13C6]Glucose73.0372.87 ± 0.424.954.79 ± 0.4245.5a Dol0 represents the mass difference obtained by subtraction of the mass of n repeating C5H8 units from the total mass of the Dol-n pseudomolecular ion [MDol-n + Na]+ and corresponds to the sum of masses of atoms highlighted in bold: [H(C5H8)n-1-CH2-CH(CH3)-CHH-CHH-OH · Na]+ Open table in a new tab In the second linear regression procedure, the average molecular masses of dolichols were analyzed as a function of the theoretical isotopic enrichments, ϵMVA and ϵMEP, expected for the MVA and MEP pathways, respectively, according Equation 4; see Table 3 for the theoretical ϵ values. M(n,ϵ)=Mnat(n)+k×ϵMEP+(n−k)×ϵMVAq (Eq. 4) According to Equation 4, the average molecular mass of a Dol-n molecule is the sum of the following three components: the molecular mass of native dolichol, Mnat(n), the mass increment from k units derived via the MEP pathway, k × ϵMEP, and the mass increment from (n – k) units derived from the MVA pathway, (n - k) × ϵMVA, and (ϵMEP = ⅔ϵMVA). All the numerical analyses, including linear regression and fitting to the Gaussian distribution via conjugated gradient method (37Brandt S. Data Analysis: Statistical and Computational Methods. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag Inc., Berlin1999: 423-427Google Scholar), were performed with the aid of GnuPlot 4.0 software (©2004 Thomas Williams, Colin Kelley, available on line). 13C NMR Analysis of Polyisoprenoid Alcohols Labeled with [1-13C]Glucose—Previous analysis of polyisoprenoid composition showed that hairy roots of C. geoides contained a family of dolichols (Dol-13 to Dol-29, with Dol-16 dominating) accompanied by traces of polyprenols of similar chain lengths (3Skorupinska-Tudek K. Bienkowski T. Olszowska O. Furmanowa M. Chojnacki T. Danikiewicz W. Swiezewska E. Lipids. 2003; 38: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because ∼60% of dolichols accumulated in Coluria roots were in the form of esters with carboxylic acids (data not shown), alkaline hydrolysis was always performed prior to further analysis. Root cultures were grown for no longer than 3 weeks to keep glucose concentration in the medium sufficiently high to ensure that it was the main carbon and energy source. It is well established in the literature that after labeling with [1-13C]glucose, carbon atoms derived from C-3 of IPP and DMAPP (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1) should not be labeled either via the MVA or the MEP pathway. Indeed, analysis of the NMR spectrum of [13C]-labeled dolichol (Table 2) confirmed that their isotope abundances were the lowest of all the carbon atoms. Thus, the signals in 13C-labeled dolichol (Dol) spectrum assigned to the IPP/DMAPP C-3 atoms were considered as reference signals of the natural 13C isotope abundance, and the mean value of their integration calculated per a single carbon atom was considered as the natural abundance of ∼1.1% and used for the subsequent normalization of the abundances of other signals. High 13C abundances in 13C-labeled dolichol spectrum were recorded for C-2 and C-4 atoms of IPP and DMAPP; the calculated average abundance for C-2 and C-4 atoms was 3.0 ± 0.4 and 3.0 ± 0.2%, respectively. Somewhat higher values were observed for C-5 atoms of IPP and DMAPP (average value 3.5 ± 0.3%). In contrast, the isotopic abundance of C-1 of IPP and DMAPP was considerably lower (average 1.3 ± 0.4%) than those of C-2, -4, and -5. Notable differences between subgroups of the C-1 type atoms we"

In numerous cases sumoylation is facilitated by protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) proteins, characterized by the presence of a SP-RING domain related to the RING finger of many ubiquitin E3 ligases. The importance of SP-RING relies on its capacity to bind the E2 enzyme of the pathway. Additional domains may participate in SUMO ligase function and target selection.

Modification of GTE3 modulates its capacity to bind acetyl-histone H3 in vitro. Interestingly, AtSIZ1, as other plant PIAS proteins, also includes a PHD domain. We found that the PHD domain binds AtSCE1 and contributes to the SUMO ligase function, being partially and absolutely required for AtSCE1 and GTE3 sumoylation, respectively.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but in the last years an emergent role as facilitators of SUMO modification of proteins is becoming clear (2Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The small polypeptide SUMO modifies function of proteins involved in a wide range of processes, for instance DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, genome stability, protein stability, and cellular localization of proteins (3Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Covalent attachment of SUMO occurs through ϵ-amino groups of Lys residues, typically found at the consensus sequence ΨKX(E/D) (Ψ, large hydrophobic residue; X, any residue) (4Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The process involves the E1-mediated ATP activation of mature SUMO, transfer to catalytic Cys of the E2 conjugating enzyme, and covalent attachment to the target, frequently arbitrated by SUMO E3 ligases, such as PIAS proteins (5Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The presence of a SP-RING (from SIZ/PIAS-RING) domain in PIAS proteins (2Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), related to the RING finger found in many ubiquitin E3 ligases and able to interact with the E2 enzyme (6Kahyo T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), has reinforced the idea that PIAS proteins play a role as SUMO E3 ligases. Other domains may specify target selection or participate in ligase function or different activities. Besides the SP-RING finger, a SAP (from SAF/ACINUS/PIAS) domain, which associates to DNA sequences of matrix attachment regions (MAR) (8Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and a non-covalent SUMO interacting motif (SIM) (9Kerscher O. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) are also distinctive of PIAS proteins. The complete SUMO pathway has been identified in Arabidopsis (10Kurepa J. Walker J.M. Smalle J. Gosink M.M. Davis S.J. Durham T.L. Sung D.Y. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6862-6872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This includes the E1 heterodimer AtSAE1/AtSAE2, the E2 AtSCE1, several SUMO proteins (AtSUM), and a unique PIAS protein, AtSIZ1. Intriguingly, besides the characteristic domains, AtSIZ1, as other plant PIAS proteins, holds a PHD domain (Fig. 1A). The C4HC3 PHD finger is reminiscent of, but different from the C3HC4 RING finger (11Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similarly, SP-RING resembles the RING finger but lacks two of the cysteines that are conserved in all known RING ubiquitin E3 ligases. AtSIZ1 has been implicated in promoting AtPHR1, ICE1, flowering locus D, and stress-induced sumoylation in Arabidopsis (12Miura K. Rus A. Sharkhuu A. Yokoi S. Karthikeyan A.S. Raghothama K.G. Baek D.

Hasegawa P.M. Plant J. 2008; 53: 530-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but interaction of AtSIZ1 or specific domains with target proteins has not been studied. As a first attempt to investigate SUMO ligase function of AtSIZ1 we have performed a biochemical characterization of this protein. Our study has revealed AtSIZ1 self-sumoylation and AtSIZ1-dependent modification of AtSCE1 and highlights the relevance of the SP-RING domain in ligase function. More interesting, we show ligase function associated to the PHD domain as it also mediates binding to the E2 enzyme. Furthermore, we have identified the bromodomain protein GTE3 as a target of AtSIZ1 that requires both the PHD and SP-RING domains to be sumoylated. This modification impairs GTE3 capacity to bind acetylhistone H3 in vitro. Finally, we propose a model of interactions to explain SUMO ligase function associated to the PHD domain. DNA Constructions—AtSUM1 (U17495), AtSAE1 (U18656), and AtSIZ1 (U22197) cDNAs were obtained from Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (NASC). AtSCE1 (AV553396) cDNA was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute. AtSAE2 (RAFL17-41-D02) cDNA was obtained from RIKEN Bioresource Center. Other cDNAs were obtained by standard PCR techniques. Vectors for protein production are described below. For in vitro translation, cDNAs were cloned in pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) to be transcribed from the T7 promoter. For the two-hybrid screening a truncated AtSIZ1 construct (amino acids 1–536) was prepared as bait. AtSIZ1 Lys to Arg and AtSCE1 Lys to Arg and Cys to Ser mutations were generated by standard PCR techniques. PHD and SP-RING fingers were disrupted by deleting amino acids 134–142 and 379–384, respectively, encompassing important residues for finger structure. To generate a SAP mutant, the 37 N-terminal amino acids of AtSIZ1 (containing most of the SAP domain) were removed. The SIM mutant construct involved the deletion of amino acids 603–607, including the SXS motif and part of the preceding hydrophobic region. For GST-PHD, GST-RING, and GST-SAP constructions, PCR products corresponding to amino acids 78–211 (encompassing the PHD, 114–166), 300–469 (encompassing the SP-RING, 359–411), and 1–74 (encompassing the SAP domain. 11–45), were used, respectively. For C-terminal deletion of AtSCE1, we amplified by PCR a DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–145. Proteins and Pulldown Assays—Proteins (Table 1) were produced in Escherichia coli DH5α or BL21 strains as GST or Histail fusions from the pGEX-6P (GE Healthcare) or pET28 (Novagen) vectors and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) or His·Bind Resin (Novagen), respectively. GST fusions were eluted with glutathione or excised from GST by using PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). For detection, FLAG or His tags were N-terminal-placed, and standard Western blot procedures were applied by using monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) or anti-His (GE Healthcare) antibodies. AtSAE1, AtSAE2, and AtSIZ1 and derived mutants were purified as GST fusions. AtSUM1 was purified as GST fusion or excised from GST. Other GST fusions were excised from GST. For production of C-terminal RanGAP1 we used the pET28RanGAP1-C2 construction (16Uchimura Y. Nakao M. Saitoh H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vitro translation in the presence of [35S]Met was performed with the T7 TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega). For pulldown, matrix-bound GST or GST fusions (0.5–1 μg) were incubated with purified (500 ng) or in vitro translated (one-tenth of the reaction) proteins in 200 μl of buffer 1 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and washed with buffer 1 and buffer 1 supplemented with 400 mm NaCl. Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For binding to peptides, 2 μg of biotinylated acetylhistone H3 peptide (Upstate Millipore) were incubated with 0.5 μg of protein in buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% bovine serum albumin). Proteins were pulled down with streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, DYNAL, Invitrogen). Washes and elution were as formerly indicated. Western blot procedures, registration of chemiluminescence with a ChemiDocXRS apparatus (Bio-Rad), or registration of radioactive areas with an InstantImager Electronic Autoradiography apparatus (Packard Instrument Co.) were used for protein detection.TABLE 1Proteins produced for this studyProteinaSee “Experimental Procedures” for detailsShort nameAccession numberbNucleotideAtSAE1 (E1)E1At5g50580AtSAE2 (E1)E1At2g21470AtSUM1 (SUMO1)SUMOAt4g26840AtSCE1 (E2)SCE (E2)At3g57870FLAG-AtSCE1Fl-SCEHis6-AtSCE1His-SCEFLAG-AtSCE1 C94SFl-C94SFLAG-AtSCE11–145 (ΔC-ter)FLAG-AtSCE1 K146R/ K147R/ K150R/K154RAtSIZ1 (E3)SIZAt5g60410AtSIZ1 SAP mutantΔSAPAtSIZ1 PHD mutantΔPHDAtSIZ1 SP-RING mutantΔRINGAtSIZ1 PHD/RING mut.ΔPHD/RINGAtSIZ1 SIM mutantΔSIMAtSIZ1 K100RK100RAtSIZ1 K450RK450RAtSIZ1 K488RK488RAtSIZ1 K100R/K488RK100/488RAtSIZ11–536 (ΔC-ter)SIZΔCPHD domainPHDSP-RING domainRINGSAP domainSAPHis6-RanGAP1RanU88155FLAG-GTE3GTE3At1g73150FLAG-GTE5GTE5At1g17790FLAG-GTE7GTE7At5g65630FLAG-AtPCNA1PCNAAt1g07370FLAG-AtPHR1PHR1At4g28610a See “Experimental Procedures” for detailsb Nucleotide Open table in a new tab Sumoylation Assays—Assays were carried out in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm ZnSO4 for 90 min at 30 °C in the presence of Arabidopsis sumoylation proteins (100 ng of AtSAE1/AtSAE2 mix (E1), 50–500 ng of AtSCE1 (E2), 1 μg of AtSUM1 (SUMO), and 25 ng of AtSIZ1 when required). One-tenth of an in vitro translation reaction was used for sumoylation assays when using AtSIZ1 as a target. In other assays AtSIZ1 or derivatives were used as GST fusions. 50 ng of a purified tagged protein were typically used as the target. Reactions were initiated with 2 mm ATP and usually stopped with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol-containing Laemmli buffer. To discriminate between sumoylation and SUMO loading on AtSCE1, samples treated with 4 m urea-containing Laemmli buffer, which enables visualization of both SUMO loading and sumoylation, were compared with samples heated in 100 mm DTT-containing Laemmli buffer that, similar to β-mercaptoethanol-containing Laemmli buffer, efficiently eliminates SUMO loading but not sumoylation. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Assays and screening were conducted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 on selective medium lacking histidine. pGBKT7 and pGA10 plasmids (Clontech) were used for Gal4 DNA binding and activation domain fusions, respectively. We screened a pGAD10-based Arabidopsis inflorescence cDNA library kindly provided by J. L. Riechmann (the Meyerowitz laboratory, California Institute of Technology). Two-hybrid mutant constructs of AtSIZ1 were derived from that used for the screening.

Reactions were performed in 16 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, containing 10 ng of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 μg bovine serum albumin with 50 ng of protein for 20 min at room temperature.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To investigate ligase function of AtSIZ1, we first decided to analyze this process. Sumoylation assays with purified Arabidopsis proteins, and in vitro translated AtSIZ1 indicated that SUMO, E1, and E2 (AtSCE1) were required for AtSIZ1 self-modification (Fig. 1B). By using SUMO or GST-SUMO, we demonstrated that this modification was due to SUMO attachment (Fig. 1B). Next we examined the role of AtSIZ1 main domains in self-sumoylation. It has previously been shown that the SP-RING domain is relevant for ligase function (6Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh E.A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because PHD and SP-RING share certain structural features (both resemble RING type fingers), we decided to examine their function in AtSIZ1 self-modification. As a control we also investigated the SAP domain. Thus, by deleting the SAP domain or disturbing the PHD or/and SP-RING fingers (Fig. 1A), we stated the importance of the SP-RING domain in self-sumoylation (Fig. 1C). We then proceeded to identify SUMO attachment consensus sites in AtSIZ1. Three consensus sites could be identified with core Lys residues at positions 100, 450, and 488 (Fig. 1A). Lys to Arg mutations revealed that Lys-100 and Lys-488 were critical for modification, and the double mutation K100R/K488R highly impaired AtSIZ1 self-sumoylation (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we have identified two sites for SUMO attachment in AtSIZ1 and emphasized the importance of the SP-RING finger in self-modification. AtSIZ1 Mediates Covalent Attachment of SUMO to E2—In the second step of sumoylation SUMO is transferred from E1 to the catalytic Cys of E2 (C94 in AtSCE1) to form an E2-SUMO thioester. Besides this process of SUMO loading, covalent attachment of SUMO to E2 (sumoylation) has also been described (19Bencsath K.P. Podgorski M.S. Pagala V.R. Slaughter C.A. Schulman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47938-47945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Chung T.L. Hsiao H.H. Yeh Y.Y. Shia H.L. Chen Y.L. Liang P.H. Wang A.H. Khoo K.H. Shoei-Lung Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39653-39662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We detected AtSIZ1-dependent modification of AtSCE1 (Fig. 2A). Because samples were treated with β-mercaptoethanol-containing Laemmli buffer that eliminates SUMO loading, it should correspond to sumoylation. Moreover, a C94S mutant (impaired in SUMO loading) was also modified when adding in trans non-tagged wild type (WT) AtSCE1 (Fig. 2A), indicating that a modification different to SUMO loading occurs. To better discriminate between SUMO loading and sumoylation, we compared samples treated with urea, which enables visualization of both SUMO loading plus sumoylation, with samples treated with DTT that, similar to β-mercaptoethanol, efficiently eliminates SUMO loading but not sumoylation. This approach let us to confirm AtSIZ1-mediated sumoylation of AtSCE1 (Fig. 2B, it is worth noting that urea treatment also permits visualization of protein dimers not related to SUMO loading or sumoylation). A specific Lys at the C terminus has been previously described as the site for sumoylation of yeast and human E2 (19Bencsath K.P. Podgorski M.S. Pagala V.R. Slaughter C.A. Schulman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47938-47945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Chung T.L. Hsiao H.H. Yeh Y.Y. Shia H.L. Chen Y.L. Liang P.H. Wang A.H. Khoo K.H. Shoei-Lung Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39653-39662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This Lys corresponds to Lys-154 in AtSCE1. We tried to eliminate Lys-146, Lys-147, Lys-150, and Lys-154 by deleting the 15 C-terminal residues of AtSCE1 (from Lys-146), but this deletion rendered inactive AtSCE1 (not shown). Otherwise, Lys to Arg mutation of these residues did not impair SUMO attachment (not shown). Thus, besides SUMO loading, AtSCE1 is susceptible of SUMO attachment mediated by AtSIZ1. The AtSIZ1 PHD Domain Contributes to AtSCE1 Sumoylation—Because AtSCE1 modification depends on AtSIZ1, we investigated the involvement of its different domains in this process. Different AtSIZ1 mutants (Fig. 1A) were assayed for their ability to facilitate SUMO attachment to AtSCE1. Our results indicated that SP-RING disruption greatly, but not completely, impaired AtSCE1 sumoylation (Fig. 2C). Because SP-RING and PHD domains may display common structural features, we analyzed the involvement of PHD in this process. No apparent defects were observed with a PHD mutant; however, low sumoylation detected in the absence of the SP-RING finger was completely abolished when using a double PHD/SP-RING mutant (Fig. 2D). Then, although the SP-RING finger seems to be essential for efficient SUMO modification of AtSCE1, the PHD domain also contributes to this function. AtSCE1 Binds to the AtSIZ1 PHD Domain—Because the relevance of SP-RING has been based on its ability to interact with E2 (6Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh E.A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we proceeded to a detailed analysis of the AtSIZ1-AtSCE1 interaction to clarify how the PHD domain participates in sumoylation. We carried out two-hybrid assays (Fig. 3A) with AtSCE1 and several AtSIZ1 constructions derived from that used in our two-hybrid screening (see below). Growth of yeast harboring a PHD mutant construction of AtSIZ1 was similar to that of yeast carrying the WT construction. On the other hand, SP-RING disruption significantly reduced the interaction, although yeast growth was still appreciable. Interestingly, growth was completely arrested by using a double PHD/SP-RING mutant construct. Pulldown assays using matrix-bound GST-AtSCE1 protein and in vitro translated AtSIZ1 mutants or matrix-bound GST fusions of different AtSIZ1 domains and purified FLAG-AtSCE1 confirmed the interactions identified by yeast two-hybrid (Figs. 3, B and C). Because the C terminus of RanGAP1 is a substrate of E2 independent of SUMO ligases (16Uchimura Y. Nakao M. Saitoh H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) but AtSIZ1 binds AtSCE1, we speculated that AtSIZ1 may have a negative effect on AtSCE1-mediated sumoylation of RanGAP1. In fact, interference of AtSIZ1 and derived mutants with RanGAP1 sumoylation was proportional to the level of interaction with AtSCE1 (Fig. 3D). Besides the ability of AtSCE1 to interact with SP-RING, we have also revealed an interaction with the PHD domain, which may account for a SUMO ligase function. A Two-hybrid Screening Identifies GTE3 as a Partner of AtSIZ1—We have investigated the AtSIZ1-mediated attachment of SUMO to AtSCE1 and to itself. To further investigate the ligase function of AtSIZ1, we decided to perform a two-hybrid screening to identify AtSIZ1 targets not involved in the SUMO pathway. Because full-length AtSIZ1 fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain transactivated two-hybrid reporters in the absence of a partner interaction, we used a truncated protein (amino acids 1–536, SIZΔC), encompassing the SAP, PHD, and SP-RING domains as bait, which retained the ability to interact with AtSCE1 (Fig. 3A). Among the positive clones isolated, we identified AtSCE1 and GTE3 (At1g73150) (Fig. 4A), belonging to the BET (bromodomain and extra terminal domain) family of proteins (21Florence B. Faller D.V. Front Biosci. 2001; 6: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pulldown experiments demonstrated a direct and specific interaction (Fig. 4B). Importantly, GTE3 showed a pattern of interaction very similar to that observed for AtSCE1; i.e. SP-RING mediated major interaction, but the PHD domain also contributed (Fig. 4A). Twelve different GTE (Global transcription factor group E) proteins have been described in Arabidopsis (ChromDB Chromatin Data base). We wondered about the specificity of AtSIZ1 interaction with other GTE members. We used the two-hybrid approach to test interaction with GTE5 (At1g17790), a protein displaying high homology (80% identity) with GTE3, and GTE7 (At5g65630) and GTE10 (At5g63330), displaying only 43% identity with GTE3. The analysis revealed interaction of AtSIZ1 with GTE5 but not with GTE7 or GTE10 (Fig. 4C). Then, our two-hybrid screening, validated by the identification of AtSCE1 among the positive clones, has also revealed a member of the GTE family as a partner of AtSIZ1. AtSIZ1 Acts as a SUMO Ligase of GTE3—We subsequently addressed whether the AtSIZ1-GTE3 interaction mediated GTE3 sumoylation. Interestingly, GTE3 was susceptible of SUMO attachment, and this depended on AtSIZ1 (Fig. 5A). To check for target specificity we assayed other proteins. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) has previously been described as a SUMO substrate in yeast, and SIZ/PIAS seems to stimulate its modification (22Reindle A. Belichenko I. Bylebyl G.R. Chen X.L. Gandhi N. Johnson E.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4749-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); however, we found that AtPCNA1 is not modified in the presence of AtSIZ1 (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, sumoylation of the Arabidopsis phosphate-related MYB transcription factor AtPHR1 has also been previously demonstrated (12Miura K. Rus A. Sharkhuu A. Yokoi S. Karthikeyan A.S. Raghothama K.G. Baek D. Koo Y.D. Jin J.B. Bressan R.A. Yun D.J. Hasegawa P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Then, under our assay conditions it was modified, although not as efficiently as GTE3 (Fig. 5B). Because GTE5 but not GTE7 interacted with AtSIZ1, we also proved AtSIZ1-dependent sumoylation of these proteins. Accordingly with the interactions described, GTE5 but not GTE7 was susceptible of sumoylation (Fig. 5C). Because bromodomains have been demonstrated to bind acetylated histone tails (23Mujtaba S. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5521-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate if GTE3 bound to acetylhistone H3. As shown in Fig. 5D, GTE3 was retained by a peptide corresponding to acetylhistone H3 N-terminal tail (acH3), whereas AtSCE1, used as a control, was not. Then we wondered about the consequences of sumoylation in binding to acH3. To investigate this, after sumoylating GTE3, half of the reaction was used in pulldown experiments with acH3 and the remaining fraction was monitored as the input. Quantification of protein bands indicated that in contrast to 77% of non-modified GTE3, only 12% of sumoylated GTE3 was retained by the acH3 peptide (Figs. 5, E and F). In sum, certain members of the GTE family are specific targets of the SUMO ligase function of AtSIZ1, and sumoylation would modulate interaction of these proteins with other partners such as acetylated histone tails. AtSIZ1-mediated Sumoylation of GTE3 Requires the PHD—We then proceeded to study the implication of the different AtSIZ1 domains in SUMO transfer to GTE3. Surprisingly, the PHD mutant was as inefficient as that lacking the SP-RING domain in promoting GTE3 modification (Fig. 6A). Even more, a double PHD/SP-RING mutant molecule did not behave differently to single mutants (Fig. 6A). Similar results were obtained with GTE5 (not shown). To ensure that mutations affecting AtSIZ1-mediated SUMO transfer did not compromise other AtSIZ1 activities, we investigated the capacity of mutant proteins to bind a DNA MAR sequence. For that, we used a MAR sequence associated to the plastocyanin locus (17van Drunen C.M. Oosterling R.W. Keultjes G.M. Weisbeek P.J. van Driel R. Smeekens S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3904-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This function typically depends on the SAP domain, and accordingly, only the SAP mutant was affected (Fig. 6B). Because PHD is used to mediate protein-protein interaction and may facilitate dimerization, which might be important for E3 function of AtSIZ1 on certain proteins, we analyzed AtSIZ1 dimer formation in two-hybrid assays, but we did not detected interaction (not shown). Hence, the AtSIZ1 PHD mutant is highly impaired in SUMO transfer to GTE3 as the one lacking the SP-RING, but these mutations do not affect another PIAS function, the binding to a MAR sequence. In the Absence of the PHD Domain, AtSCE1 and GTE3 Compete for Binding to AtSIZ1—We have revealed a similar pattern of interaction of AtSCE1 and GTE3 with AtSIZ1 domains. This may lead to competition for binding and be reflected on ligase capacity. In the absence of the PHD domain, no AtSIZ1-mediated modification of GTE3 is detected. As PHD seems to constitute an alternative to the SP-RING for AtSCE1 and GTE3 association, this may anticipate in its absence, E2 (AtSCE1) and target (GTE3) compete for SP-RING binding and that both proteins mutually exclude each other. Then, we decided to investigate competition. Because GTE3 sumoylation obviously requires AtSCE1 (Fig. 5A), it is difficult to assess a competition effect of AtSCE1 on GTE3 sumoylation. By contrast, by using the PHD mutant, inactive in GTE3 sumoylation (Fig. 6A) but efficient in AtSCE1 modification (Figs. 2, C and D), we can measure AtSCE1 sumoylation in the presence of GTE3 as a reflection of competition of both proteins for binding to AtSIZ1. Results indicated that a 5-fold increase in GTE3 concentration abrogated AtSCE1 modification, whereas a similar concentration of other proteins such as AtPHR1 or AtPCNA1 had no effect (Fig. 7A). Moreover, competition of AtSCE1 and GTE3 for binding to the SP-RING domain was corroborated in pulldown experiments (Fig. 7B). Therefore, these results provide evidence that when mutating the PHD domain, GTE3 and AtSCE1 may compete for binding to AtSIZ1. AtSIZ1 has been implicated in phosphate starvation responses, salicylic acid-dependent pathogen defense, flowering, basal thermotolerance, and cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (24Miura K. Jin J.B. Hasegawa P.M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), but SUMO ligase function on specific targets has not been ascribed to particular AtSIZ1 domains. In this study we describe AtSIZ1 self-sumoylation and AtSIZ1-mediated sumoylation of AtSCE1 and GTE3 and attribute a SUMO ligase function in the modification of these proteins to the PHD domain. We have discriminated between SUMO loading and covalent attachment of SUMO to AtSCE1 and found than the last is dependent on A"
https://openalex.org/W2055528911,"Separation of duplicated centrosomes (spindle-pole bodies or SPBs in yeast) is a crucial step in the biogenesis of the mitotic spindle. In vertebrates, centrosome separation requires the BimC family kinesin Eg5 and the activities of Cdk1 and polo kinase; however, the roles of these kinases are not fully understood. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SPB separation also requires activated Cdk1 and the plus-end kinesins Cin8 (homologous to vertebrate Eg5) and Kip1. Here we report that polo kinase has a role in the separation of SPBs. We show that adequate accumulation of Cin8 and Kip1 requires inactivation of the anaphase-promoting complex-activator Cdh1 through sequential phosphorylation by Cdk1 and polo kinase. In this process, Cdk1 functions as a priming kinase in that Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation creates a binding site for polo kinase,which further phosphorylates Cdh1. Thus, Cdh1 inactivation through the synergistic action of Cdk1 and polo kinase provides a new model for inactivation of cell-cycle effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2090985948,"Human retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) was implicated in the oxidation of all-trans-retinol for biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid, however, initial assays suggested that RDH10 prefers NADP+ as a cofactor, undermining its role as an oxidative enzyme. Here, we present evidence that RDH10 is, in fact, a strictly NAD+-dependent enzyme with multisubstrate specificity that recognizes cis-retinols as well as all-trans-retinol as substrates. RDH10 has a relatively high apparent Km value for NAD+ (∼100 μm) but the lowest apparent Km value for all-trans-retinol (∼0.035 μm) among all NAD+-dependent retinoid oxidoreductases. Due to its high affinity for all-trans-retinol, RDH10 exhibits a greater rate of retinol oxidation in the presence of cellular retinol-binding protein type I (CRBPI) than human microsomal RoDH4, but like RoDH4, RDH10 does not recognize retinol bound to CRBPI as a substrate. Consistent with its preference for NAD+, RDH10 functions exclusively in the oxidative direction in the cells, increasing the levels of retinaldehyde and retinoic acid. Targeted small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of endogenous RDH10 or RoDH4 expression in human cells results in a significant decrease in retinoic acid production from retinol, identifying both human enzymes as physiologically relevant retinol dehydrogenases.

Retinoic acid is a small lipophilic molecule derived from vitamin A that regulates gene expression through binding to nuclear transcription factors, retinoic acid receptors (1Mangelsdorf, D., Umesono, K., and Evans, R. M. (1994) in The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine (Sporn, M. B., Roberts, A. B., and Goodman, D. S., eds) pp. 319-350, Raven Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde is the rate-limiting step in retinoic acid biosynthesis (2Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); however, the identity of the physiologically relevant retinol dehydrogenase(s) has long been controversial. Two types of enzymes have been implicated in the oxidation of retinol: cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) 2The abbreviations used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; RDH or RoDH, retinol dehydrogenase; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; RL-HSD, RoDH-like 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; CRBP, cellular retinol binding protein; HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells; HA, hemagglutinin; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. of the medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily and microsomal dehydrogenases (RoDH) of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily (reviewed in Ref. 3Duester G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several criteria have been suggested for evaluation of the candidate retinoid oxidoreductases. First of all, it was proposed that to function in the oxidative direction in vivo, the enzyme has to prefer NAD+ as a cofactor (reviewed in Ref. 4Kedishvili N.Y. Curr. Org. Chem. 2002; 6: 1247-1257Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), because unlike NADP+, NAD+ exists mostly in the oxidized form in the majority of cells (5Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Second, it was argued that the physiologically relevant retinol dehydrogenase must recognize retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein type I (holoCRBPI) as a substrate, because holoCRBPI is the predominant form of retinol in the cells (2Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Finally, the enzyme essential for the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde was expected to be expressed in the “hot spots” of retinoic acid biosynthesis during various stages of development and be relatively well conserved to support retinoic acid biosynthesis across all vertebrate species (4Kedishvili N.Y. Curr. Org. Chem. 2002; 6: 1247-1257Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Neither of the currently known retinoid oxidoreductases appears to satisfy all of these requirements (4Kedishvili N.Y. Curr. Org. Chem. 2002; 6: 1247-1257Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For example, microsomal rat retinol dehydrogenase, RoDH1, recognizes holoCRBPI as a substrate, but prefers NADP+ as a cofactor (6Boerman M.H. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7027-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, RoDH1 is not particularly well conserved across species (7Belyaeva O.V. Kedishvili N.Y. Genomics. 2006; 88: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cytosolic retinoid-active ADHs are NAD+-dependent, but individual ADH isozymes are not present in all “hot spots” of retinoic acid biosynthesis and do not recognize holoCRBPI as a substrate (4Kedishvili N.Y. Curr. Org. Chem. 2002; 6: 1247-1257Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 8Kedishvili N.Y. Gough W.H. Davis W.I. Parsons S. Li T.K. Bosron W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To date, genes for several of the candidate retinol dehydrogenases have been selectively disrupted in mice (9Deltour L.

Acta. 2007; 1770: 694-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); however, neither gene from the ADH or SDR superfamilies was found to be individually required for retinoic acid biosynthesis, suggesting that either retinol dehydrogenases are redundant or the essential enzyme has not yet been identified. Thus far, the only enzyme proven to be important for retinol oxidation in vivo is the NAD+-dependent 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (11-cis-RDH, RDH5), which catalyzes the oxidation of 11-cis-retinol for regeneration of visual pigment 11-cis-retinal in retinal pigment epithelium (14Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Mutations in human 11-cis-RDH were linked to fundus albipunctatus, a disease characterized by profound delayed dark adaptation of cone and rod cells (15Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). One of the features that distinguish 11-cis-RDH from other NAD+-dependent retinol dehydrogenases is the remarkably high degree of 11-cis-RDH conservation across all vertebrate species (7Belyaeva O.V. Kedishvili N.Y. Genomics. 2006; 88: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), probably reflecting its physiological importance. The only other retinoid oxidoreductase with a similar degree of conservation is retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) (16Wu B.X. Chen Y. Chen Y. Fan J. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 3365-3372PubMed Google Scholar). However, initial assays of recombinant RDH10 activity in COS cells suggested that RDH10 strongly prefers NADP+ over NAD+ as a cofactor (16Wu B.X. Chen Y. Chen Y. Fan J. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 3365-3372PubMed Google Scholar), contradicting one of the major requirements for an oxidative enzyme. Nevertheless, mutations in murine Rdh10 were recently linked to embryonic lethality in mice treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (17Sandell L.L. Sanderson B.W. Moiseyev G. Johnson T. Mushegian A. Young K. Rey J.P. Ma J.X. Staehling-Hampton K. Trainor P.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rdh10 may be essential for retinoic acid biosynthesis during embryonic development. Here, to clarify the role of RDH10 in retinoid metabolism and to evaluate the relative potential of other candidate SDRs as retinol dehydrogenases, we investigated the cofactor and substrate specificity of RDH10; examined its ability to utilize holoCRBPI as a substrate; and assessed the contribution of RDH10 and similar SDRs to retinoic acid biosynthesis in living human cells. RDH10 Expression Constructs—The full-length RDH10 cDNA (2751 bp) in pCMV-SPORT vector was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, IMAGE clone number 6153778). To prepare a vector for expression of RDH10 in HEK293 cells, an XhoI restriction site was constructed on the 5′-end of RDH10 cDNA through subcloning into pBluescriptSK(-) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). RDH10 was excised from RDH10-pBluescriptSK(-) plasmid with XhoI and NotI endonucleases and cloned into the matching sites (SalI-NotI) of pCMV-HA vector (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) in-frame with the N-terminal HA tag. To express untagged RDH10, a ∼1.5-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment containing the full-length RDH10 coding sequence, 5′-untranslated sequence, and partial 3′-untranslated sequence was transferred from the IMAGE clone into the pCMV-Tag4a vector (Stratagene). For expression in Sf9 cells, the RDH10 coding sequence was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGC TCT AGA ATG AAC ATC GTG GTG GAG TTC TTC G-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGC AAG CTT GAT TCC ATT TTT TGC TTC ATT ATT GTT TGT G-3′ (antisense) to introduce XbaI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively (underlined). This PCR product was subcloned between the XbaI and HindIII sites of pET28a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) as an intermediate step before transferring the RDH10 cDNA into the SmaI-NotI sites of the pVL1393 vector modified as described previously (18Belyaeva O.V.

All cDNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Activity Assays and Kinetic Characterization—Kinetic characterization of RDH10 catalytic properties was carried out using the microsomal preparation of the recombinant enzyme obtained from Sf9 cells. RDH10-His6 was expressed in Sf9 cells using the Baculovirus expression system (Orbigen Inc., San Diego, CA) as described previously for other retinoid-active microsomal SDRs (18Belyaeva O.V.

Microsomes containing RDH10 were isolated by differential centrifugation, resuspended in 90 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 40 mm potassium chloride (reaction buffer), supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 20% glycerol, and stored in small aliquots at -80 °C (20Gough W.H.

Determination of kinetic constants of RDH10 was performed as described previously in detail for RDH12 and RDH11 (18Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinaldehyde, and 9-cis-retinaldehyde were obtained from Sigma and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). 11-cis-Retinaldehyde was a kind gift from Dr. Rosalie Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). 9-cis-Retinol and 11-cis-retinol were synthesized by KBH4 reduction of the corresponding retinaldehydes, followed by HPLC purification. For activity assays, the required amount of retinoid in ethanol was added to the reaction buffer supplemented with equimolar delipidated bovine serum albumin and the mixture was sonicated for 10 min to disperse retinoids. The actual amount of solubilized retinoid was determined based on the corresponding molar absorption coefficients at the appropriate wavelength. The following molar absorption coefficients in aqueous solutions were used: ϵ328 = 39500 m-1 cm-1 for all-trans-retinol, ϵ326 = 39733 m-1 cm-1 for 9-cis-retinol, and ϵ329 = 25800 m-1 cm-1 for 11-cis-retinol (21Gallego O. Belyaeva O.V. Porté S. Ruiz F.X. Stetsenko A.V. Shabrova E.V. Kostereva N.V. Farrés J. Parés X. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in siliconized glass tubes for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of methanol. Retinoids were extracted twice with 2 volumes of hexane, dried under N2 gas, reconstituted into hexane, and separated by normal phase HPLC on a Spherisorb S3W column (4.6 × 100 mm) (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) in hexane/ethyl acetate (90:10, v/v) mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min using the Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array. The apparent Km values for retinols were determined at 1 mm NAD+ and 5–6 concentrations (0.0625–2 μm) of all-trans-retinol, 9-cis-retinol, or 11-cis-retinol. The apparent Km value for all-trans-retinaldehyde was determined at 1 mm NADH and six concentrations of all-trans-retinaldehyde (0.125–8 μm). The apparent Km value for NAD+ was determined at saturating all-trans-retinol (5 μm) and 5–6 concentrations of cofactor (1–625 μm). The background value without cofactor was determined for each concentration of substrate and was subtracted from each data point. The amount of protein varied between 3 and 20 μg, so that the amount of the product did not exceed 10% of the substrate. Reaction rates were determined based on the percent substrate conversion as described previously (18Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were calculated using GraFit (Erithacus Software Ltd., UK) and expressed as the mean ± S.D. The results shown are representative of three to four experiments. ApoCRBPI and holoCRBPI were prepared as described previously (19Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The A350/A280 ratio of the holo-CRBPI was 1.75. Sf9 microsomes containing recombinant human RoDH4 were prepared as described in Gough et al. (20Gough W.H. VanOoteghem S. Sint T. Kedishvili N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19778-19785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RDH10—HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were selected for these experiments because they are well characterized in terms of retinoid metabolism (22Chen Y. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 345-354PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chen Y. Moiseyev G. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Vision Res. 2003; 43: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All RDH10 overexpression experiments were conducted in comparison with mock-transfected cells. HEK293 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% horse serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and transiently transfected with the expression construct for RDH10 in pCMV-HA or pCMV-Tag4a vector using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, growth medium was replaced by a fresh medium containing either 2 μm all-trans-retinol or 5 μm all-trans-retinaldehyde. Retinoids were added to the medium from ethanol stocks. The final ethanol concentration did not exceed 0.6% (v/v). Cells were incubated with retinaldehyde or retinol as indicated. After the incubations, media and cells were collected separately under reduced light and aliquots of cell suspensions were taken for protein quantification and Western blot analysis. Retinoids were extracted into hexane (24Napoli, J. L., and Horst, R. L. (1998) in Methods in Molecular Biology: Retinoid Protocols (Redfern, C. P. F., ed) Vol. 89, pp. 29-40, Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJGoogle Scholar) and separated by normal phase HPLC using the Spherisorb S3W column as described above except that the linear mobile phase consisted of 99.6:0.3:0.1 hexane:isopropyl alcohol:acetic acid. Peaks were identified by comparison to retention times of retinoid standards and evaluation of wavelength maxima and quantified as described previously (18Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—The protocol for Western blot analysis was described elsewhere (18Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RDH10-His6 expression in Sf9 cells was detected using His tag monoclonal mouse antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) at a 1:6,000 dilution. HA-RDH10 expression in HEK293 cells was detected using HA tag monoclonal antibody 12CA5 at a 1:100 dilution (antibodies were obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Hengbin Wang, Department of Biochemistry, University of Alabama School of Medicine). Secondary goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was used at a 1:40,000 dilution. RDH10 polyclonal antiserum was generated in rabbit at Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). SacI-XhoI fragment encoding amino acids 159–341 was excised from RDH10 pVL1393 expression construct and subcloned into SacI-XhoI sites of pET21(a) vector (Novagen). Truncated RDH10 polypeptide fused to the C-terminal His6 tag was expressed in bacterial cells. The recombinant protein was abundant in the insoluble fraction but exhibited poor binding to metal affinity resin. The insoluble fraction of bacterial homogenate was dissolved in 6 m urea and subjected to electrophoreses in 10% SDS-PAGE. The band corresponding to partial RDH10 was purified by electroelution and used as an antigen. A 1:5,000 dilution of the antiserum detected 2 ng of purified truncated RDH10 when used with a 1:40,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce). RT-PCR Analysis of SDR Gene Expression—To test for endogenous expression of RDH10 in HEK293 cells, total RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamer primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). A 393-base pair fragment of the RDH10 transcript was amplified using forward primer 5′-AGG GAG AAC GTC TAC CTG AC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCT GAA CAT GCC AGT GTC TAC-3′. RT-PCR analysis of RoDH4 and RL-HSD expression was carried out using gene-specific pairs of primers: 5′-GAC TTC GTG ACC ATA CTG GAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAG GTG GGC ATG TAG CTC ATG-3′ (reverse), for RoDH4; and 5′-CAT TCT TAC ACC AAT TAC CTT ATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTC ATG TTT GTC ATT CCC GTT C-3′ (reverse) for RL-HSD. The expected sizes of the products for RoDH4 and RL-HSD were 515 and 309 bp, respectively. siRNA-mediated Knockdowns of SDR Gene Expression—To silence the expression of SDRs in HEK293 cells, the cells were grown in 35-mm dishes to 100% confluence and transfected with corresponding siRNA reagents in OptiMEM using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Negative control siRNA was ON-TARGETplus™ siCONTROL® pool of four nontargeting duplexes (D-001206-13-20, Dharmacon). The final concentrations of SDR-targeting or control siRNAs were 100 nm. To achieve more efficient silencing, transfections were repeated after a 24-h interval. Expression of RDH10 was silenced using ON-TARGETplus pool of four RDH10-targeting siRNA duplexes (LU-010008-01-0002, Dharmacon, Inc. Lafayette, CO) or individual siRNA duplexes. Sequences of the individual duplexes were as follows: duplex 9, 5′-CGG CUG AAA GAG UCC GCA AUU-3′; duplex 10, 5′-AGU GUA AAU UAA CCG ACU AUU-3′; duplex 11, 5′-GUU CAG UAC UGC CGG AGU UUU-3′, duplex 12, 5′-CAG UUG ACA UCU UCG CAA UUU-3′. Silencing of RoDH4 and RL-HSD gene expression was carried out using siGENOME SMARTpools M-008311-00 and M-009280-00 (Dharmacon), respectively. One day after the second transfection cells were treated with 10 μm retinol for 24 h and retinoid metabolites were analyzed as described above. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from siRNA-transfected HEK293 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA (20–30 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-XL nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled RDH10 549-base pair cDNA probe (SacI-NotI fragment of RDH10-pVL1393 construct) in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA bands were visualized by exposure to x-ray film at -80 °C with two intensifying screens for several days. A cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a loading control. Cycloheximide Treatment—HEK293 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and transfected with RDH10 in pCMV-Tag4A vector encoding untagged native RDH10 as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, medium was replaced with a growth medium containing cycloheximide at 25 μg/ml (added from a 25 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol) or a vehicle. Cells from the cycloheximide-treated and control dishes were harvested 36 h after treatment and the levels of RDH10 protein in homogenates were analyzed by Western blotting using RDH10 rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Densitometric and Statistical Analysis—Densitometric analysis of the protein bands was done using UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific Corporation, Orem, UT). Statistical significance was determined by a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Expression and Kinetic Characterization of Human RDH10—To characterize the catalytic properties of human RDH10, we expressed the enzyme in insect Sf9 cells using the Baculovirus expression system (18Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19778-19785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recombinant RDH10 protein was abundant in the microsomal fraction of the cells and could be readily visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 after separation of proteins in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). RDH10 constituted ∼10% of the total microsomal protein as determined by gel scanning densitometry. Electrophoretic mobility of the 354-amino acid recombinant His6-tagged RDH10 correlated well with the predicted molecular mass of 39.6 kDa. The activity of RDH10 in the microsomes was relatively stable, but some loss of activity occurred after repetitive freeze-thaw cycles. Purification of RDH10-His6 from Sf9 cells using nickel affinity chromatography produced an inactive enzyme; therefore, microsomal preparations of RDH10 were used for its kinetic characterization as described previously for other microsomal retinoid oxidoreductases (18Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19778-19785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Specific activity of RDH10 (nmol min-1 mg-1) was the same with 2 or 20 μg of microsomal protein, indicating a linear relationship between the amount of protein and the reaction rate. To determine the cofactor preference of RDH10, the retinol dehydrogenase activity of RDH10-containing microsomes was assayed in the presence of 1 mm NAD+ or NADP+. These assays showed that with NAD+ as a cofactor, RDH10-containing microsomes exhibited a 49-fold greater rate of retinol oxidation than wild-type Sf9 microsomes (1.48 ± 0.2 versus 0.03 ± 0.01 nmol min-1 mg-1). In contrast, with NADP+ as a cofactor, the activity of RDH10-containing microsomes did not exceed that of wild-type microsomes (0.17 ± 0.03 nmol min-1 mg-1). Further analysis of RDH10 activity over a wide range of NADP+ concentrations (2–6,250 μm) using 2–20 μg of microsomal protein confirmed that RDH10 was not active in the presence of NADP+. Thus, RDH10 appeared to be strictly an NAD+-dependent oxidoreductase, contrary to the previous report (16Wu B.X. Chen Y. Chen Y. Fan J. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 3365-3372PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis revealed that the apparent Km value of RDH10 for NAD+ with all-trans-retinol as substrate was ∼100 μm (Table 1). RDH10 was also quite active in the reductive direction with all-trans-retinaldehyde in the presence of NADH as a cofactor, challenging earlier findings (16Wu B.X. Chen Y. Chen Y. Fan J. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 3365-3372PubMed Google Scholar), which showed little or no activity of RDH10 toward all-trans-retinaldehyde. In fact, the apparent Vmax value of RDH10 in the reductive direction was higher than that in the oxidative direction, but because of the ∼10-fold lower Km value for all-trans-retinol, the catalytic efficiency of RDH10 (Vmax/Km) was greater in the oxidative direction (Table 1), indicating that RDH10 is a more efficient retinol dehydrogenase than a retinaldehyde reductase.TABLE 1Kinetic constants of human RDH10 Kinetic constants were determined using the same preparation of microsomes containing RDH10.

https://openalex.org/W1987706913,"Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases. Stress-induced overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), is one of the early events of inflammation. The objective of this study was to elucidate mechanistic links between oxidative stress and overproduction of IL-8 in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. We found that exposure of RPE cells to H2O2, paraquat, or A2E-mediated photooxidation resulted in increased expression and secretion of IL-8. All of these oxidative stressors also inactivated the proteasome in RPE cells. In contrast, tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBH), a lipophilic oxidant that did not stimulate IL-8 production, also did not inactivate the proteasome. Moreover, prolonged treatment of RPE cells with proteasome-specific inhibitors recapitulated the stimulation of IL-8 production. These data suggest that oxidative inactivation of the proteasome is a potential mechanistic link between oxidative stress and up-regulation of the proinflammatory IL-8. The downstream signaling pathways that govern the production of IL-8 include NF-κB and p38 MAPK. Proteasome inhibition both attenuated the activation and delayed the turnoff of NF-κB, resulting in biphasic effects on the production of IL-8. Prolonged proteasome inhibition (>2 h) resulted in activation of p38 MAPK via activation of MKK3/6 and increased the production of IL-8. Chemically inhibiting the p38 MAPK blocked the proteasome inhibition-induced up-regulation of IL-8. Together, these data indicate that oxidative inactivation of the proteasome and the related activation of the p38 MAPK pathway provide a potential link between oxidative stress and overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8.

Gerontol. 2000; 35: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Inflammatory events are also known to participate in the pathogenesis of these age-related diseases. The activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors may be involved in triggering the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (2Chung H.Y. Sung B. Jung K.J. Zou Y. Yu B.P. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 572-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, the molecular links between oxidative stress and inflammation are not fully understood. Retina has the highest metabolic rate and oxygen consumption in the body. The high metabolic rate and oxygen consumption is usually accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species. Chronic exposure to light could also increase the production of reactive oxygen species (1Beatty S. Koh H. Phil M. Henson D. Boulton M. Surv. Ophthalmol. 2000; 45: 115-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 4Liang F.Q. Godley B.F. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Therefore, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a primary target of oxidative stress. Age-related accumulation of lipofuscin in RPE is another source of oxidative stress. Lipofuscin is a mixture of non-degradable protein-lipid aggregates derived from the ingestion of photoreceptor outer segments (5Sparrow J.R. Boulton M. Exp. Eye Res. 2005; 80: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A2E is the major fluorophore of lipofuscin and acts as a photosensitizer to generate reactive oxygen species inside the cells upon exposure to blue light (5Sparrow J.R. Boulton M. Exp.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16182-16187Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Moreover, complement activation is associated with enhanced expression of IL-8, an important inflammatory cytokine (14Fukuoka Y. Medof E.M. Curr. Eye Res. 2001; 23: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Fukuoka Y. Strainic M. Medof M.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 131: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Increased expression of IL-8 was also reported when RPE were fed oxidized photoreceptor outer segments (16Higgins G.T. Wang J.H. Dockery P. Cleary P.E. Redmond H.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The increased expression of IL-8 may account, at least in part, for the inflammatory reactions during development of AMD (16Higgins G.T. Wang J.H. Dockery P. Cleary P.E. Redmond H.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Kalayoglu M.V. Bula D. Arroyo J. Gragoudas E.S. D'Amico D. Miller J.W. Graefe's Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 2005; 243: 1080-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate IL-8 expression under these conditions remain to be elucidated. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is the major non-lysosomal proteolytic pathway within cells (18Ciechanover A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 474-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 20Shang F. Taylor A. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Proteins destined for degradation are first conjugated with a polyubiquitin chain by the sequential action of three classes of enzymes: E1, E2, and E3. The ubiquitin-protein conjugates are then recognized and degraded by a large protease complex called the proteasome (19Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 21Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The UPP has been involved in a myriad of cellular processes (20Shang F. Taylor A. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Welchman R.L. Gordon C. Mayer R.J. Nat.

Dysfunction of the UPP has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (25Hope A.D. de Silva R. Fischer D.F. Hol E.M. van Leeuwen F.W. Lees A.J. J.

Because the UPP is involved in the regulation of gene expression and because it can be inactivated by oxidative stress (32Caballero M. Liton P.B. Epstein D.L. Gonzalez P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2008; 49 (in press)Google Scholar), we hypothesized that oxidative inactivation of the UPP is a molecular mechanism that links oxidative stress to inflammatory events during the development of many degenerative diseases. The results of this study show that exposing ARPE-19 cells to H2O2, paraquat, and A2E-mediated photooxidation resulted in the inactivation of the proteasome and a dramatic increase in the expression and secretion of IL-8. In contrast, TBH, a lipophilic oxidant that did not inactivate the proteasome, also failed to stimulate the production of IL-8. Furthermore, prolonged treatment of ARPE-19 cells with proteasome inhibitors delayed the turnoff of NF-κB, activated the p38 MAPK, and led to a dramatic up-regulation of IL-8. Moreover, inhibiting p38 MAPK abolished the up-regulation of IL-8 induced by proteasome inhibitors. These data support the hypothesis that oxidative inactivation of the proteasome is a mechanistic link between oxidative stress and IL-8 overproduction. Because overproduction of IL-8 was suggested to play a role in the development of AMD (16Higgins G.T. Wang J.H. Dockery P. Cleary P.E. Redmond H.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). MG132 and SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Epoxomicin was purchased from Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA). Sodium orthovanadate, paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium dichloride), Bay 11-7082, and the monoclonal antibody against β-actin were obtained from Sigma. The nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot was obtained from Bio-Rad. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated p38 MAPK and MKK3/6, total p38 MAPK, MKK3, and MKK6 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG and sheep anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The Super-Signal chemiluminescent detection kit was purchased from Pierce. The DuoSet ELISA kit for IL-8 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The NF-κB oligonucleotide was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell Culture and Treatments—The retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19 (40Dunn K.C. Aotaki-Keen A.E. Putkey F.R. Hjelmeland L.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) was obtained from ATCC. The cells were routinely maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and containing 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Before treatment, confluent cell monolayers were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh medium was added. For proteasome inhibition studies, MG132 and epoxomicin were prepared in DMSO at 10 mm and diluted to 10 (MG 132) and 5 μm (epoxomicin) in the cell medium immediately before use. Cells were incubated with proteasome inhibitors for different periods of time as indicated in the figure legends. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 was prepared in DMSO at 10 mm and then diluted to 10 μm in the cell medium immediately before use. The NF-κB inhibitor Bay 11-7082 was prepared in DMSO at 20 mm and then diluted to 10 μm in the cell medium immediately before use. Exposure to H2O2, Paraquat, or Tert-Butylhydroperoxide (TBH)—Subconfluent ARPE-19 cells were incubated in serum-, pyruvate-, and phenol red-free DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose in the presence of the indicated concentrations of H2O2, paraquat, or TBH for 1 h. The cells were then collected and proteasome activity was determined using a fluorogenic peptide as substrate. For IL-8 secretion studies, the cells were exposed to different concentrations of H2O2, paraquat, or TBH as described above. After a 1-h incubation, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to recover for 8 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS, pyruvate, and phenol red. Exposure to A2E and Blue Light—ARPE-19 cells devoid of endogenous lipofuscin were grown to confluence and then cultured in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acid solution with or without 10 μm A2E for 2 weeks. The medium was changed twice a week. With this protocol, A2E accumulates in the lysosomal compartment of the cells (41Sparrow J.R. Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2988-2995PubMed Google Scholar). For blue light exposure, the medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium, magnesium, and glucose and exposed to 430-nm light delivered from a tungsten halogen source (430 ± 20 nm for 15 min at 2.62 milliwatt/cm2). The cells were then cultured in DMEM with 1% fetal calf serum for another 6 h. The medium was collected to determine IL-8 levels and the cells were collected for proteasome activity assay. Controls included cultures that had neither accumulated A2E nor been exposed to blue light, cells that accumulated A2E only or that had only been exposed to blue light. All the control cells were cultured in the same way as the cells that had accumulated A2E and were exposed to blue light. Proteasome Activity Assay—ARPE-19 cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6. The chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome was determined using the fluorogenic peptide succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amidomethylcoumarin (LLVY-AMC) as a substrate (42Bulteau A.L. Lundberg K.C. Humphries K.M. Sadek H.A. Szweda P.A. Friguet B. Szweda L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30057-30063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The mixture, containing 20 μl of cell supernatant in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, was incubated at 25 °C with the peptide substrate (LLVY-AMC at 25 μm) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, and 0.04% CHAPS. The final volume of the assay was 200 μl. Rates of reactions were measured in a temperature-controlled microplate fluorometric reader. Excitation/emission wavelengths were 380/440 nm. Proteasome activity was defined as the portion of peptidase activity in the cell extracts that was inhibited by 20 μm MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis. After treatment, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, a phosphatase inhibitor, and immediately collected in SDS loading buffer. Cell lysates were then denatured at 100 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein (50 or 100 μg/lane) were resolved on 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated p38 MAPK and MKK3/6, total p38 MAPK, MKK3, and MKK6, or mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin. After incubation with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the specific bound antibody was visualized using Super Signal chemiluminescent detection kit. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Levels of IL-8 secreted into the medium by RPE were determined by ELISA. The medium was diluted 10 times to determine IL-8 levels. All ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA extraction from ARPE-19 cells and real time RT-PCR analysis were performed as described (27Fernandes A.F. Guo W. Zhang X. Gallagher M. Ivan M. Taylor A. Pereira P. Shang F. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 83: 1472-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For IL-8, the forward primer was: 5′-AAACCACCGGAAGGAACCAT-3′ and the reverse primer was: 5′-CCTTCACACAGAGCTGCAGAAA-3′. Levels of GAPDH were used for normalization of the total amount of mRNA. For quantification of GAPDH mRNA, the forward primer was 5′-ATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extract preparations and DNA-binding assays were performed as previously described (43Dudek E.J. Shang F. Taylor A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The NF-κB DNA-binding double-stranded oligonucleotide used was 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. Specific DNA binding complex of NF-κB was identified as the band that disappeared when a 50-fold excess of cold oligonucleotide competitor was added in binding assays. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test assuming equal variances for all data points. H2O2, Paraquat, or A2E-mediated Photooxidation Increases Production of IL-8 by RPE—A number of studies indicate that oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the dysfunction of RPE and in the pathogenesis of AMD (1Beatty S. Koh H. Phil M. Henson D. Boulton M. Surv. Ophthalmol. 2000; 45: 115-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 4Liang F.Q. Godley B.F. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential link between oxidative stress and inflammation, we determined the effect of oxidative stress on secretion of IL-8, a proinflammatory cytokine. First, we assessed the effect of H2O2 exposure on the secretion of IL-8 by RPE. As shown in Fig. 1A, incubation of ARPE-19 cells with H2O2 increased secretion of IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure of ARPE-19 cells to 500 μm H2O2 for 1 h resulted in a 2-fold increase in the secretion of IL-8 (Fig. 1A). We then determined the effect of paraquat, a superoxide generator (44Cocheme H.M. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1786-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), on the secretion of IL-8. The results show that exposure of ARPE-19 cells to 500 and 1000 μm paraquat for 1 h significantly increased the production of IL-8 (Fig. 1B), but exposure to lower concentrations of paraquat (<200 μm) had no detectable effect on IL-8 secretion (Fig. 1B). To further confirm the relationship between oxidative stress and up-regulation of IL-8, we evaluated the effect of A2E-mediated photooxidation on secretion of IL-8. Whereas exposure to blue light alone had little effect on IL-8 production, accumulation of A2E alone significantly increased IL-8 secretion as compared with the control (Fig. 1C). However, the combination of accumulation of A2E and blue light exposure further increased the secretion of IL-8 (Fig. 1C). Similar to the increase in IL-8 proteins in the medium, the mRNA levels of IL-8 in the cells also dramatically increased in response to these types of oxidative stress (Fig. 2). However, the extents to which IL-8 mRNA levels increased in response to oxidative stress were much greater than the increase in IL-8 proteins in the medium. Previous genomic and proteomic analyses found that for a substantial number of genes the absolute amount of protein in the cell is not strongly correlated to the amount of mRNA (45Nie L. Wu G. Zhang W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 46Tian Q. Stepaniants S.B. Mao M. Weng L. Feetham M.C. Doyle M.J. Yi E.C. Dai H. Thorsson V. Eng J. Goodlett D. Berger J.P. Gunter B. Linseley P.S. Stoughton R.B. Aebersold R. Collins S.J. Hanlon W.A. Hood L.E. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 960-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Whereas the levels of mRNA are mainly controlled by the transcription activity and mRNA stability, the levels of proteins reflect mRNA level, translation efficiency, and posttranslational modification and degradation. Secretion efficiency may also control the IL-8 levels in the medium. Taken together, these data suggest that physiologically relevant sources of oxidative stress lead to an up-regulation of IL-8 in RPE. These data are consistent with previous reports showing that oxidative stress stimulates IL-8 production in several cell types (47Ito K. Hanazawa T. Tomita K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 48Tomita K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Inflammation. 2003; 27: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the data show that accumulation of A2E alone also induced the secretion of IL-8, although it did not cause detectable oxidative damage, indicating that the expression and secretion of IL-8 are regulated by both oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms.FIGURE 2Oxidative stress increases IL-8 mRNA levels. ARPE-19 cells were cultured in serum-, pyruvate-, and phenol red-free DMEM in the presence of different concentrations of H2O2 for 1 h (panel A), or in the presence of different concentrations of paraquat for 1 h (panel B) and allowed to recover for 8 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS, pyruvate, and phenol red. Alternatively, ARPE-19 cells were treated with blue light, A2E, or A2E plus blue light as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” (panel C). The cells were lysed in situ and total RNA was extracted. Levels of mRNA for IL-8 were assessed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. GAPDH mRNA was used as a control to normalize the total mRNA levels. The results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Asterisk indicates p < 0.01 and double asterisk indicates p < 0.001 as compared with the control group; #, p < 0.001 as compared with blue light or A2E alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) H2O2, Paraquat, or A2E-mediated Photooxidation Inactivates the Proteasome in RPE—The UPP plays important roles in the regulation of many transcription factors and gene expression in response to various stimuli.

To test whether oxidation-induced proteasome inactivation could be the potential mechanistic link between oxidative stress and the enhanced production of IL-8 by RPE cells, we determined the effect of oxidative stress on proteasome activity in ARPE-19 cells. As predicted, exposure of RPE cells to H2O2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the proteasome activity (Fig. 2A). The proteasome in ARPE-19 cells was inhibited by H2O2 concentrations as low as 50 μm in the medium. The chymotrypsin activity of th"

Here, we have shown that frequent RTT-causing missense mutations (R106W, R133C, F155S, T158M) located in the methylated DNA-binding domain (MBD) of MeCP2 have profound and diverse effects on its structure, stability, and DNA-binding properties. Fluorescence spectroscopy, which reports on the single tryptophan in the MBD, indicated that this residue is strongly protected from the aqueous environment in the wild type but is more exposed in the R133C and F155S mutations. In the mutant proteins R133C, F155S, and T158M, the thermal stability of the domain was strongly reduced. Thermal stability of the wild-type protein was increased in the presence of unmethylated DNA and was further enhanced by DNA methylation. DNA-induced thermal stability was also seen, but to a lesser extent, in each of the mutant proteins. Circular dichroism (CD) of the MBD revealed differences in the secondary structure of the four mutants. Upon binding to methylated DNA, the wild type showed a subtle but reproducible increase in alpha-helical structure, whereas the F155S and R106W did not acquire secondary structure with DNA. Each of the mutant proteins studied is unique in terms of the properties of the MBD and the structural changes induced by DNA binding. For each mutation, we examined the extent to which the magnitude of these differences correlated with the severity of RTT patient symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W1971940467,"Current evidence supports a binding model in which the insulin molecule contains two binding surfaces, site 1 and site 2, which contact the two halves of the insulin receptor. The interaction of these two surfaces with the insulin receptor results in a high affinity cross-linking of the two receptor α subunits and leads to receptor activation. Evidence suggests that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) may activate the IGF-I receptor in a similar mode. So far IGF-I residues structurally corresponding to the residues of the insulin site 1 together with residues in the C-domain of IGF-I have been found to be important for binding of IGF-I to the IGF-I receptor (e.g. Phe23, Tyr24, Tyr31, Arg36, Arg37, Val44, Tyr60, and Ala62). However, an IGF-I second binding surface similar to site 2 of insulin has not been identified yet. In this study, we have analyzed whether IGF-I residues corresponding to the six residues of the insulin site 2 have a role in high affinity binding of IGF-I to the IGF-I receptor. Six single-substituted IGF-I analogues were produced, each containing an alanine substitution in one of the following positions (corresponding insulin residues in parentheses): Glu9 (HisB10), Asp12 (GluB13), Phe16 (LeuB17), Asp53 (SerA12), Leu54 (LeuA13), and Glu58 (GluA17). In addition, two analogues with 2 and 3 combined alanine substitutions were also produced (E9A,D12A IGF-I and E9A,D12A,E58A IGF-I). The results show that introducing alanine in positions Glu9, Asp12, Phe16, Leu54, and Glu58 results in a significant reduction in IGF-I receptor binding affinity, whereas alanine substitution at position 53 had no effect on IGF-I receptor binding. The multiple substitutions resulted in a 33–100-fold reduction in IGF-I receptor binding affinity. These data suggest that IGF-I, in addition to the C-domain, uses surfaces similar to those of insulin in contacting its cognate receptor, although the relative contribution of the side chains of homologous residues varies. Current evidence supports a binding model in which the insulin molecule contains two binding surfaces, site 1 and site 2, which contact the two halves of the insulin receptor. The interaction of these two surfaces with the insulin receptor results in a high affinity cross-linking of the two receptor α subunits and leads to receptor activation. Evidence suggests that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) may activate the IGF-I receptor in a similar mode. So far IGF-I residues structurally corresponding to the residues of the insulin site 1 together with residues in the C-domain of IGF-I have been found to be important for binding of IGF-I to the IGF-I receptor (e.g. Phe23, Tyr24, Tyr31, Arg36, Arg37, Val44, Tyr60, and Ala62). However, an IGF-I second binding surface similar to site 2 of insulin has not been identified yet. In this study, we have analyzed whether IGF-I residues corresponding to the six residues of the insulin site 2 have a role in high affinity binding of IGF-I to the IGF-I receptor. Six single-substituted IGF-I analogues were produced, each containing an alanine substitution in one of the following positions (corresponding insulin residues in parentheses): Glu9 (HisB10), Asp12 (GluB13), Phe16 (LeuB17), Asp53 (SerA12), Leu54 (LeuA13), and Glu58 (GluA17). In addition, two analogues with 2 and 3 combined alanine substitutions were also produced (E9A,D12A IGF-I and E9A,D12A,E58A IGF-I). The results show that introducing alanine in positions Glu9, Asp12, Phe16, Leu54, and Glu58 results in a significant reduction in IGF-I receptor binding affinity, whereas alanine substitution at position 53 had no effect on IGF-I receptor binding. The multiple substitutions resulted in a 33–100-fold reduction in IGF-I receptor binding affinity. These data suggest that IGF-I, in addition to the C-domain, uses surfaces similar to those of insulin in contacting its cognate receptor, although the relative contribution of the side chains of homologous residues varies. IGF-I 2The abbreviations used are: IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor-I; IR, insulin receptor; IGF-IR, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CD, circular dichroism. is a single chain polypeptide that plays an important role in regulating growth and development (1Baker J.

Med. 1996; 335: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). IGF-I consists of 70 amino acid residues arranged in four domains. The A and B domains are homologous to the A and B chains of insulin (Fig. 1), whereas the C-domain connecting the A- and B-domain and the D-domain extending from the C-terminal end of the A-domain are only present in IGF-I (3Humbel R.E.

The three-dimensional structures of insulin and IGF-I are also very similar. The B-domain of the two molecules is arranged in a central α-helix including residues 8–17 (B9–B19) (insulin residues in parentheses), and the A-domain contains two anti-parallel α-helices including residues 43–48 (A1–A8) and residues 54–60 (A13–A20) (4Rinderknecht E.

The insulin receptor family consists of the insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin-receptor-related receptor, all of which are receptortyrosine kinases. The members of the insulin receptor family consist of two receptor halves, each comprising an extracellular α-subunit and a transmembrane β-subunit, linked by a disulfide bridge. The receptor exists as a dimer when no ligand is bound, making an α2β2 receptor held together by disulfide bridges between the two α-subunits. The IR and the IGF-IR have sequence similarities varying from 41 to 84% depending on which regions are being compared. The overall structure of the L1–Cys-rich–L2 domains of the two receptors have been shown by x-ray crystallography to be similar (8Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol.

Numerous studies indicate that the IR and IGF-IR contains two separate binding sites for the ligand; however, only one ligand binds and activates the α2β2 receptor dimer. Insulin is believed to interact with the receptor using two binding surfaces, which cross-link the two receptor halves. This cross-linking is important for high affinity binding and thereby for downstream signaling (9De Meyts P. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 12De Meyts P.

The site 1 binding surface of insulin encompasses almost all of the dimerization surface of insulin, whereas the site 2 binding surface is located on the opposite side of insulin and includes several residues also involved in the hexamer-forming surface of insulin (12De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 15De Meyts P. Van Obberghen E. Roth J.

Therefore, the question arises of whether IGF-I interacts with the receptor in a similar “two-surface” manner as insulin and whether the surfaces are equivalent to the binding surfaces of insulin. A large body of evidence suggests that IGF-I activates the IGF-IR in a similar way as insulin. IGF-I binding to the IGF-IR has been analyzed extensively and shows similar binding properties to those seen for insulin (12De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev.

IGF-I binding exhibits a curvilinear Scatchard plot indicating the co-existence of more than one binding site. The dissociation of prebound labeled IGF-I is accelerated in the presence of increasing concentration of cold ligand, indicating that the binding sites exert negative cooperativity (17Christoffersen C.T. Bornfeldt K.E. Rotella C.M. Gonzales N. Vissing H. Shymko R.M. ten Hoeve J. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. De Meyts P.

The main difference in binding properties between IGF-I and insulin is that the dose-response curve for negative cooperativity is sigmoid rather than bell-shaped. Unlike insulin, there is no loss of accelerated dissociation at high concentrations of IGF-I. Several IGF-I residues equivalent to the residues believed to compose the site 1 binding surface of insulin are important for binding of IGF-I to the IGF-IR, i.e. Phe23 (PheB24), Tyr24 (PheB25), Val44 (ValA3), Tyr60 (TyrA19), and Ala62 (AsnA21) (insulin residues are in parentheses) (8Adams T.E.

In addition, several IGF-I residues are involved in IGF-IR binding, including Ala8, Met59, and some C-domain residues, i.e. Tyr31, Arg36, and Arg37, but are not important for insulin binding to its receptor (because there is no C-domain is present in insulin) (8Adams T.E.

Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2A) illustrates a way in which IGF-I could interact with one receptor half. In this model the IGF-I molecule is docked using a few parameters (Asp8 and Glu90 on the receptor <4.5 Å from IGF-I, Tyr24 of IGF-I <4.5 Å from the IGF-IR, and finally, Arg36 and Arg37 <8 Å from Glu242 on the IGF-IR). Fig. 2A illustrates this model, with residues corresponding to the site 2 binding surface of insulin highlighted in black, i.e. Glu9 (HisB10), Asp12 (GluB13), Phe16 (LeuB17), Asp53 (SerA12), Leu54 (LeuA13), and Glu58 (GluA17) (insulin residues in parentheses) (Fig. 2, B and C) (12De Meyts P.

It is clear from Fig. 2 that a surface more or less equivalent to the second binding surface of insulin is exposed and could have a role in cross-linking to the opposite receptor half. Previously IGF-IR binding analysis of Asp12 to alanine substitution and a Glu9 to lysine substitution suggested that these residues are important for IGF-IR binding (27Jansson M. Uhlén M. Nilsson B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Magee B.A. Shooter G.K. Wallace J.C. Francis G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15863-15870Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, a comparative study of all candidate site 2 residues has never been made. Here we show by alanine scanning mutagenesis that several of the IGF-I residues corresponding to the putative second binding surface of insulin are important for achieving high affinity IGF-I binding to the IGF-IR. The data show that Glu9 together with Asp12, Phe16, Leu54, and Glu58 play an important role in high affinity binding of IGF-I to the IGF-IR.

Briefly, inclusion bodies from a 0.5-liter fermentation were dissolved in 8 m urea containing 40 mm glycine, 0.1 m Tris, and 20 mm dithiothreitol at pH 9.1. Inclusion bodies were immediately desalted on a Superdex 75 column (1 × 30 cm (GE Healthcare)) using the same buffer but with 1.6 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions containing the IGF-I fusion proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and by reverse-phase chromatography and pooled. IGF-I folding was performed in 2 m urea, 10 mm glycine, 0.1 m Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, pH 9.1, and by dilution to less than 0.1 mg/ml. Cleavage of the fusion partner and a final reverse phase HPLC clean up were achieved as previously described (22Shooter G.K. Magee B. Soos M.A. Francis G.L. Siddle K. Wallace J.C. J. Mol.

Purified IGF-I analogues were analyzed by mass spectroscopy (Dr. Chris Bagley and Chris Cursaro, Adelaide Proteomics Facility) and were shown to have correct masses. Quantification of analogues was performed by comparing analytical C4 HPLC profiles with profiles of standard Long™R3IGF-I preparations. Correct folding of the analogues was tested by recording far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This method has been described previously (34Delaine C. Alvino C.L. McNeil K.A. Mulhern T.D.

Approximately 500,000 fluorescence counts of europium-labeled IGF-I were added to each well together with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed 4 times with 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and twice with water. DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) (100 μl/well) was added before time-resolved fluorescence was measured using 340-nm excitation and 612-nm emission filters with a BMG Laboratory Technologies Polarstar fluorimeter (Mornington, Australia). The assays were performed at least three times for each analogue. EC50 values were calculated using a sigmoid dose-response curve fit in the program GraphPad Prism 4.0. Whole cell receptor binding assays were performed using 293EBNA IGF-IR cells. For competition assays 1.0 × 105 cells/ml (10–20% binding) were incubated with 125I-labeled IGF-I (20,000 cpm/50 μl) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the cold ligand in a final volume of 500 μl for 3 h at 15 °C in Hepes binding buffer (100 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose, 15 mm sodium acetate, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), pH 7.6). Afterward, two separate 200-μl aliquots were transferred to centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The membrane pellet was counted in a Wallac WIZARD gamma counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The assays were performed at least three times for each analogue. Binding data were corrected for nonspecific binding and analyzed by computer-fitting using an Excel program developed in our laboratory by A. V. Groth and R. M. Shymko to obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). The EC50 values were also calculated using a sigmoid dose-response curve fit with variable slope in the program GraphPad Prism 4.0. For dose-response curves for negative cooperativity (accelerated dissociation), 2.0 × 107 293EBNA IGF-IR cells/ml were incubated with 125I-labeled IGF-I (150,000 cpm/ml of cells) for 2 h at 15 °C. Afterward the cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant (unbound ligand) was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in the same concentration of Hepes binding buffer, and 25 μl of cells were transferred to tubes containing increasing concentrations of cold ligand in 1 ml of Hepes binding buffer. The dissociation of prebound ligand was stopped after 30 min at 15 °C by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The membrane pellet was counted in a gamma counter. The assays were performed at least three times for each analogue. Kinase Receptor Activation Assay—The kinase receptor activation assays were performed as previously described (29Denley A.

Briefly, P6 IGF-IR cells were grown overnight in 96-well plates in a concentration of 2.5 × 104 cells/well and serum-starved for 4 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stimulated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of ligand at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The reaction was stopped by cell lysis at 4 °C using lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) with 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 μl/ml). IGF-IR was captured by transferring the cell lysate to Greiner Lumitrac 600 plates precoated with 24-31 antibody (35Soos M.A. Field C.E. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Zhang B. Roth R.A. Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Siddle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12955-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IGF-IRs were detected by adding europium-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Time-resolved fluorescence was measured as described above. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—DNA synthesis was quantified as [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) incorporation into genomic DNA according to an optimized method by C. Bonnesen and M. Oleksiewicz 3C. Bonnesen and M. Oleksiewicz, manuscript in preparation. (previously described in Ref. 36Gauguin L. Klaproth B. Sajid W. Andersen A.S. McNeil K.A. Forbes B.E. De-Meyts P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2604-2613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, L6 rat muscle myoblasts were starved in medium containing 0.1% serum and stimulated for 19 h in medium containing 0.1% serum supplemented with increasing concentrations of ligand. The cells were pulsed with 0.125 μCi/well [3H]thymidine for 2 h and harvested onto glass-fiber filters using a MICRO 96TM Skatron harvester (Molecular Devices). The filters were counted in a Wallac MicroBeta Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression, Quantification, and Characterization of the IGF-I Analogues—All the IGF-I analogues were successfully expressed in an E. coli expression system. Eight IGF-I analogues were expressed, six single-substituted analogues (E9A IGF-I, D12A IGF-I, F16A IGF-I, D53A IGF-I, L54A IGF-I, and E58A IGF-I), one double-substituted analogue (E9A,D12A IGF-I), and finally one triple-substituted analogue (E9A,D12A,E58A IGF-I). All analogues were of the correct mass as measured by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Alanine substitution generally has little effect on the overall structure of a molecule (37Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To confirm this was the case with these new analogues, we performed far UV CD. Misfolding of IGF-I analogues can be clearly identified by a significant change in the far UV spectrum from the spectrum seen for IGF-I (38Gill R. Verma C. Wallach B. Ursø B. Pitts J. Wollmer A. De Meyts P. Wood S. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All eight IGF-I analogues exhibited almost identical far UV CD spectra as seen for IGF-I (Fig. 3), confirming that the substituted alanines had little overall effect on secondary structure and that correct folding was achieved. Binding Properties of the IGF-I Analogues—The affinities of the analogues were tested in two different competition assays using either a soluble receptor assay where the IGF-IR from lysed P6 IGF-IR cells are captured by 24-31 antibody or a whole cell receptor assay using 293EBNA IGF-IR cells. The average EC50 values obtained in the soluble receptor assay and the average EC50 and Kd values obtained for the whole cell assay for each analogue are shown in Table 1. The curves are illustrated in Fig. 4, A–C, for the whole cell receptor assay. Because the Kd values and EC50 values are comparable for the whole cell receptor assay, the following comparisons between the two assays are made using the EC50 values.TABLE 1Competition by IGF-I analogues for europium-labeled IGF-I binding to soluble IGF-IR from lysed P6 IGF-IR cells and 125I-labeled IGF-I binding to 293EBNA IGF-IR cellsLigandSoluble IGF-IR293EBNA IGF-IREC50 ± S.D.Rel EC50EC50 ± S.D.Rel EC50Kd ± S.D.Rel Kdnm%nm%nm%IGF-I0.29 ± 0.031000.35 ± 0.041000.25 ± 0.02100E9A IGF-I0.86 ± 0.20343.87 ± 0.3093.55 ± 0.277D12A IGF-I0.99 ± 0.28291.89 ± 0.50192.29 ± 0.5711F16A IGF-I0.58 ± 0.02501.04 ± 0.16340.58 ± 0.0643D53A IGF-I0.40 ± 0.04730.50 ± 0.08700.38 ± 0.0566L54A IGF-I1.20 ± 0.09241.57 ± 0.57221.15 ± 0.1222E58A IGF-I1.88 ± 0.60154.50 ± 1.0883.69 ± 0.887E9A,D12A IGF-I>10<3>10<3>10<3E9A,D12A,E58A IGF-I>100<1>100<1>100<1 Open table in a new tab IGF-I has"

Six invariant cysteine residues forming three indispensable disulfide bonds and one Gly residue required structurally for an atypical β-bulge are totally conserved in the otherwise diverse sequences of all known mammalian α-defensins. In addition, a pair of oppositely charged residues (Arg/Glu), forming a salt bridge across a protruding loop in the molecule, is highly conserved. To investigate the structural and functional roles of the conserved Arg6–Glu14 salt bridge in human α-defensin 5 (HD5), we chemically prepared HD5 and its precursor proHD5 as well as their corresponding salt bridge-destabilizing analogs E14Q-HD5 and E57Q-proHD5. The Glu-to-Gln mutation, whereas significantly reducing the oxidative folding efficiency of HD5, had no effect on the folding of proHD5. Bovine trypsin productively and correctly processed proHD5 in vitro but spontaneously degraded E57Q-proHD5. Significantly, HD5 was resistant to trypsin treatment, whereas E14Q-HD5 was highly susceptible. Further, degradation of E14Q-HD5 by trypsin was initiated by the cleavage of the Arg13–Gln14 peptide bond in the loop region, a catastrophic proteolytic event resulting directly in quick digestion of the whole defensin molecule. The E14Q mutation did not alter the bactericidal activity of HD5 against Staphylococcus aureus but substantially enhanced the killing of Escherichia coli. By contrast, proHD5 and E57Q-proHD5 were largely inactive against both strains at the concentrations tested. Our results confirm that the primary function of the conserved salt bridge in HD5 is to ensure correct processing of proHD5 and subsequent stabilization of mature α-defensin in vivo.

In humans, defensins are classified into α- and β-families, differing by amino acid composition, cellular origin, and disulfide connectivity. To date, six human α-defensins have been identified, including four primarily from neutrophils, also known as human neutrophil peptides 1–4 or HNP1–4 2The abbreviations used are: HNP, human neutrophil peptide; HD5, human α-defensin 5; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-HPLC; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometer; Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl. 2The abbreviations used are: HNP, human neutrophil peptide; HD5, human α-defensin 5; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-HPLC; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometer; Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl.

Although more than 30 putative β-defensin genes have been described using genomics tools (13Jia H.P. Schutte B.C. Schudy A. Linzmeier R. Guthmiller J.M. Johnson G.K. Tack B.F. Mitros J.P.

Human α-defensins are synthesized in vivo as significantly larger precursor molecules consisting of an N-terminal pro domain of 43–49 amino acid residues and a C-terminal Cys-rich defensin domain of 29–33 amino acid residues. The pro domain in proHNPs, important for correct folding, sorting, and trafficking of defensins (17Liu L. Ganz T. Blood. 1995; 85: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Valore E.V. Martin E.

Immediately after phagocytosis, HNPs along with several antimicrobial enzymes including elastase are discharged into the microbe-containing phagocytic vacuole where microbial killing occurs (21Segal A.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 197-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). By contrast, stored in the granules of Paneth cells is unprocessed proHD5, which is secreted, both constitutively and inducibly, into the gut crypts of the small intestine where cleavages by trypsin generate mature HD5 (22Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). A fully functional HD5 on the crypt and lumenal surfaces of intestinal epithelia is important for the innate defense against bacterial infection and may also provide antimicrobial protection for stem cells in the gut epithelial layer within the crypts (23Zasloff M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 508-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Bevins and colleagues (24Salzman N.H. Ghosh D. Huttner K.M. Paterson Y. Bevins C.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) demonstrated in a mouse model that Paneth cells-associated expression of HD5 affords remarkable resistance of transgenic mice to oral challenge with virulent Salmonella typhimurium, providing support for a critical in vivo role of epithelial-derived defensins in mammalian host defense. Notably, the metalloproteinase matrilysin is required for the processing of mouse Paneth cell α-defensins (also known as cryptdins) (25Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in matrilysin, thus lacking functional mature cryptdins, are highly susceptible to orally administered Salmonella, indicative of the importance of cryptdins in defense against gut-associated pathogens (25Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 26Ouellette A.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 306: 1-25PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of all known mammalian α-defensins indicates that in addition to the six Cys residues forming three structurally indispensable disulfide bridges and Gly17, the salt bridge between Arg5 and Glu13 (HNP1 numbering) is highly conserved. Xie et al. (27Xie C. Prahl A. Ericksen B. Wu Z. Zeng P. Li X. Lu W.Y. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32921-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have previously shown that Gly17 adopting unusual dihedral torsion angles is required for the formation of an atypical β-bulge structure conserved in the α-defensin family and that replacement of Gly17 by any other l-amino acids in HNP2 invariably results in defensin misfolding. In a separate study, Wu et al. (28Wu Z. Li X. de Leeuw E. Ericksen B. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43039-43047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) demonstrated that destabilization of the conserved Arg5–Glu13 salt bridge in HNP1, whereas functionally inconsequential, dramatically accelerates proteolytic degradation of HNP1 by human neutrophil elastase, suggesting the importance of the salt bridge for defensin in vivo stability. Notably, Rosengren et al. (29Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L. Fornander L.M. Jonsson L.M. Shirafuji Y. Qu X. Vogel H.J. Ouellette A.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28068-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) recently reported that destabilization of the conserved salt bridge in mouse cryptdin 4 (Crp4) through a series of mutations of Glu15 (Crp4 numbering) has little impact on the bactericidal activity of the defensin, a result in agreement with that reported by Wu et al. (28Wu Z. Li X. de Leeuw E. Ericksen B. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43039-43047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the findings by Wu et al. (28Wu Z. Li X. de Leeuw E. Ericksen B. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43039-43047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), E15D-Crp4 and other salt bridge-deficient mutants are resistant to cleavage by the procryptdin processing enzyme matrilysin (29Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L. Fornander L.M. Jonsson L.M. Shirafuji Y. Qu X. Vogel H.J. Ouellette A.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28068-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The authors therefore concluded that the conserved salt bridge in Crp4 is not linked to proteolytic stability of the mature defensin (29Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L. Fornander L.M. Jonsson L.M. Shirafuji Y. Qu X. Vogel H.J. Ouellette A.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28068-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To better understand why the salt bridge is conserved in α-defensins and to account for the reported discrepancy on its role in defensin stability, we expanded our study to include HD5 whose processing enzyme (trypsin) has been previously identified (22Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We chemically synthesized HD5 and proHD5 as well as two corresponding salt bridge-destabilizing analogs: E14Q-HD5 and E57Q-proHD5 (Fig. 1). Detailed biochemical, functional, and structural characterizations of these synthetic defensin/pro defensin molecules help to establish that the conserved Arg6–Glu14 (HD5 numbering) salt bridge is critical not only for correct processing of proHD5 by trypsin but also for proteolytic stability of mature HD5 in the presence of its processing enzyme. Total Chemical Synthesis of HD5, proHD5, E14Q-HD5, and E57Q-proHD5—The amino acid sequences of HD5 and proHD5 are as follows: 1ATCYCRTGRC10; 11ATRESLSGVC20; 21EISGRLYRLC30; 31CR (HD5); and 1ESLQERADEA10; 11TTQKQSGEDN20; 21QDLAISFAGN30; 31GLSALRTSGS40; 41QARATCYCRT50; 51GRCATRESLS60; 61GVCEISGRLY70; 71RLCCR75 (proHD5). Arg43–Ala44 in proHD5 is the known processing site by trypsin both in vivo and in vitro (22Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The conserved salt bridge is formed between Arg6 and Glu14 (in bold typeface) in HD5, as shown in the crystal structure of a chemically synthesized HD5 (30Szyk A. Wu Z. Tucker K. Yang D. Lu W. Lubkowski J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2749-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (PDB code: 1zmp), and, presumably, between Arg49 and Glu57 in proHD5. Preparation of correctly folded synthetic HD5 used for this work was essentially as described previously (31Wu Z. Ericksen B. Tucker K. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 64: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similar procedures were used to synthesize E14Q-HD5. Native chemical ligation (32Dawson P.E. Kent S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 923-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 33Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar) of the following peptide fragments was used to assemble proHD5 and E57Q-proHD5: (1–47)-proHD5-αCOSR (R = CH2CH2CO-Leu-OH), (5–32)-HD5, and E14Q-(5–32)-HD5. Syntheses of E14Q-HD5, (5–32)-HD5, and E14Q-(5–32)-HD5 on Boc-Arg(Tos)-OCH2-PAM resin and of (1–47)-proHD5-αCOSR on Boc-Leu-OCH2-PAM resin were performed using an in-house chemistry tailored from the N,N-diisopropylethylamine in situ neutralization/2-(1H-benzotriazolyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate activation protocol originally developed by Kent and colleagues (34Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 35Kent S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) for Boc solid phase peptide synthesis. After chain assembly, the peptides were deprotected and cleaved by anhydrous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of 5% p-cresol at 0 °C for 1 h followed by precipitation with cold ether. All crude peptides were purified to homogeneity by preparative C18 reversed phase (RP) HPLC on a Waters Delta Prep 600 system, and their molecular masses were ascertained by a Micromass ZQ-4000 single quadrupole electrospray ionization-mass spectrometer (ESI-MS). Native chemical ligation between (1–47)-proHD5-αCOSR and (5–32)-HD5 or E14Q-(5–32)-HD5 was carried out at a total peptide concentration of 13 mg/ml in 0.25 m phosphate buffer containing 6 m GuHCl and 2% (v/v) thiophenol, pH 7.5. The ligation reaction went to completion overnight at room temperature, yielding a full-length proHD5 or E57Q-proHD5, which was subsequently purified to homogeneity by preparative RP-HPLC. The determined molecular masses of fully reduced HD5, E14Q-HD5, proHD5, and E57Q-proHD5 were in agreement with the expected values calculated on the basis of the average isotopic compositions of the four synthetic molecules. All defensins were quantified by UV absorbance measurements at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients calculated according to the algorithm published by Pace et al. (36Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). Comparative Oxidative Folding of HD5, proHD5, E14Q-HD5, and E57Q-proHD5—Productive oxidative folding of HD5 was previously established (31Wu Z. Ericksen B. Tucker K. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 64: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For comparison, reduced peptides were first dissolved at 2 mg/ml in 8 m urea containing 12 mm reduced and 1.2 mm oxidized glutathione followed by a 4-fold dilution with 0.25 m sodium bicarbonate. 30-μl aliquots were withdrawn at different time intervals (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h), to which an equal volume of 10% acetic acid was added to quench the reaction. The resultant solution (40 μl) was injected for HPLC analysis, which was performed at 40 °C on a Waters Symmetry™ C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient of 5–65% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 30 min. For data points collected at time 0, a reducing buffer containing 0.25 m phosphate, 6 m GuHCl, and 0.01 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, was used to dissolve peptide followed by acidification and HPLC quantification. The folding yields were calculated based on the ratio of the integrated areas of the two peaks given by folded defensin and fully reduced starting material. Obtaining Correctly Folded E14Q-HD5 and R6A-HD5 from Pro Defensin—We also synthesized (R43M, E57Q)-proHD5 and (R43M, R49A)-proHD5 using native chemical ligation. The Met residue was introduced to facilitate chemical release of the C-terminal defensin domain after folding. The pro defensin mutant (R43M, E57Q)-proHD5 or (R43M, R49A)-proHD5 was folded in 2 m urea, 3 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione, pH 8.3. Quantitative cleavage of the Met43–Ala44 peptide bond was achieved after an overnight reaction of the folded (R43M, E57Q)-proHD5 or (R43M, R49A)-proHD5 (1 mg/ml) with CNBr (25 mg/ml) in 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and the resultant E14Q-HD5 and R6A-HD5 were purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC. In Vitro Processing of proHD5 and E57Q-proHD5 by Trypsin—ProHD5 or E57Q-proHD5 at 0.5 mg/ml was incubated at room temperature with 0.01 mg/ml bovine trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Co.) in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.001% Triton X-100, pH 8.3. Aliquots of 100 μl were withdrawn and quenched with 20 μl of 10% acetic acid at different time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h), of which 60 μl was injected for RP-HPLC analysis on a Waters XBridge C18 column (3.5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) running a linear gradient of 5–45% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. ESI-MS was used to identify the cleavage products separated by analytical HPLC. X-ray Crystallographic Studies of Trypsin-processed HD5—To verify the correct fold of the mature HD5 obtained by the processing of proHD5 with trypsin, we subjected it to the detailed crystallographic analysis. The crystallization and x-ray data collection protocols essentially replicated those described by us earlier for an HD5 preparation obtained by the folding of reduced defensin (30Szyk A. Wu Z. Tucker K. Yang D. Lu W. Lubkowski J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2749-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The x-ray data collected for the single crystal of HD5 extended to the resolution of 2.1 Å. The space group (P6522) and unit cell parameters (a = b = 49.52 Å, c = 254.9 Å) were identical or nearly identical to reported previously (30Szyk A. Wu Z. Tucker K. Yang D. Lu W. Lubkowski J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2749-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Using the program Phaser (37Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), the structure of HD5 could be easily solved with the model of this protein taken from the Protein Data base (Protein Data Bank entry code: 1zmp). A few steps of refinement with the program Refmac 5 (38Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar), were sufficient to prove that the “new” structure of HD5 is virtually identical to previously reported. Values of the crystallographic R-factor and free-R for the final model were 0.217 and 0.258, respectively, and the root-mean-square deviation calculated for all the equivalent Cα-atoms was less than 0.1 Å. The detail characteristics from the data collection and the structure refinement are shown in supplemental Table S1. Proteolytic Stability of HD5 and E14Q-HD5—HD5 and E14Q-HD5 at 0.5 mg/ml each were incubated at room temperature with 0.0025 mg/ml bovine trypsin in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.001% Triton X-100, pH 8.3. Aliquots of 80 μl were withdrawn at different time intervals (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h for HD5; 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min for E14Q-HD5), acidified by 20 μl of 10% acetic acid, and injected (50 μl) for analysis on a Waters XBridge C18 column (3.5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) running a linear gradient of 5–45% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The percentage of residual defensin was calculated based on the ratio of integrated peak areas of the intact molecule at a given time versus at time 0. The percentages of the intermediate produced due to the first cleavage at the Arg13–Gln14 bond were calculated based on the ratio of integrated peak areas of cleaved E14Q-HD5 at a given time versus the intact starting material at time 0. Identical experiments were performed using R6A-HD5 and trypsin. In addition, the proteolytic stability of HD5 and E14Q-HD5 was examined under similar conditions with bovine chymotrypsin (Worthington Biochemical Co.), human leukocyte elastase (Elastin Products Co., Inc.), and human matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) (Chemicon). Antibacterial Activity of HD5, proHD5, E14Q-HD5, and E57Q-proHD5—Antimicrobial assays against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (Microbiologics) were conducted using a previously detailed 96-well turbidimetric method dubbed virtual colony counting (39Ericksen B. Wu Z. Lu W. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A 2-fold dilution series of defensin, ranging from 25 to 0.098 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with E. coli or S. aureus (1 × 106 colony-forming units/ml) followed by the addition of twice-concentrated Mueller-Hinton broth (2×) and 12-h kinetic measurements of bacterial growth at 650 nm. The Arg6–Glu14 Salt Bridge Is Important for In Vitro Oxidative Folding of HD5 but Dispensable for proHD5—We previously developed highly efficient protocols for in vitro oxidative folding of all six human α-defensins and some of their pro forms (20Wu Z.

Ericksen B. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2003; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As was demonstrated with HNP2, destabilization of the conserved salt bridge was detrimental to the folding of reduced HNP2 but had no adverse effect on the folding of reduced proHNP2 (28Wu Z. Li X. de Leeuw E. Ericksen B. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43039-43047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the Arg6–Glu14 salt bridge in the folding of HD5 and proHD5, we comparatively monitored time-dependent oxidative folding kinetics of HD5, E14Q-HD5, proHD5, and E57Q-proHD5 using analytical RP-HPLC coupled with ESI-MS, and the results are plotted in Fig. 2. Consistent with our previous finding that the pro peptide catalyzes oxidative folding of α-defensins in vitro (20Wu Z. Li X. Ericksen B. de Leeuw E. Zou G. Zeng P. Xie C. Li C. Lubkowski J. Lu W.Y. Lu W. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), proHD5 folded significantly more efficiently than HD5, with nearly 90% of proHD5 folded within 2 h as opposed to ∼40% of HD5 during the same time period. Although the yield of folded proHD5 plateaued at ∼92% after 4 h, the yield of folded HD5 slowly increased over time to ∼60% after 8 h. Expectedly, destabilization of the salt bridge dramatically reduced the folding efficiency of HD5, as evidenced by merely a 5% yield of folded E14Q-HD5 during an 8-h time period. However, the folding kinetics of E57Q-proHD5 was nearly identical to that of proHD5, suggesting that the salt bridge-destabilizing mutation (Glu57 → Gln57 in proHD5) had no impact on the folding of the defensin precursor. These results are entirely consistent with our previous findings on HNP2 (28Wu Z. Li X. de Leeuw E. Ericksen B. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43039-43047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 3 are folded and purified proHD5 and E57Q-proHD5 on analytical RP-HPLC and ESI-MS. Their determined molecular masses of 8103.6 ± 0.6 and 8102.7 ± 0.9 Da are in good agreement with the expected values of 8102.9 and 8102.0 Da, respectively, calculated on the basis of average isotopic compositions of the folded pro defensins. Trypsin Correctly and Efficiently Processes proHD5 in Vitro—Ghosh et al. (22Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) found that in human Paneth cells, trypsinogen is co-localized with proHD5 in the secretory granules. Upon secretion of proHD5 and trypsinogen, a yet-to-be-identified molecular event activates the enzyme, which in turn removes the pro region of proHD5, yielding predominantly mature HD5 and an N-terminally elongated (by an extra seven amino acid residues) minor processing product, i.e. TSGSQARHD5 (22Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To investigate the processing pathway of synthetic proHD5 in vitro, we incubated, at room temperature, 100 μg of proHD5 with 2 μg of bovine pancreatic trypsin in buffer, at pH 8.3, and monitored on HPLC and ESI-MS the cleavage reaction at different time intervals (30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h). The representative chromatographic traces collected at 30 min and 2 h are shown in Fig. 4. Within 30 min, proHD5 was nearly quantitatively converted to mature HD5 (found 3582.1 Da, expected 3582.2 Da), the minor processing product TSGSQARHD5 (found 4269.9 Da, expected 4269.9 Da), and a major fragment from the pro peptide, 15–36 (found 2263.6 Da, expected 2263.4 Da). Over time, the extra seven amino acid residues at the N terminus of TSGSQARHD5 were slowly excised by trypsin, suggesting that the first and most productive cleavage in proHD5 occurs at the expected maturation site Arg43–Ala44 rather than at the upstream site Arg36–Thr37. Notably, a transient, N-terminally truncated proHD5, Δ14-proHD5 (found 6515.7 Da, expected 6515.3 Da), was also detected during the cleavage reaction. Otherwise, intact HD5 largely remained as the terminally processed product during the entire time period (4 h). Trypsin-processed HD5 Is Correctly Folded—We previously reported the crystal structure (1zmp) of a synthetic HD5 prepared by stepwise solid phase peptide synthesis (30Szyk A. Wu Z. Tucker K. Yang D. Lu W. Lubkowski J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2749-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that oxidative folding of proHD5 and subsequent cleavage by trypsin yielded correctly folded HD5, we solved the crystal structure of trypsin-processed HD5 at 2.1 Å resolution. Shown in Fig. 5 are dimeric HD5 and its blown-up loop region stabilized by the Arg6–Glu14 salt bridge, where two well defined H-bonds, at an average distance of 2.8 Å, are depicted between Nϵ and Nη2 of Arg6 and Oϵ1 and Oϵ2 of Glu14. The charge-charge interaction, along with a perpendicular disulfide bond (Cys10–Cys30),"

Many studies suggest that complexin-I can arrest the fusion reaction and that synaptotagmin-I can release the complexin-I blockage in a calcium-dependent manner.

Herein, by using an in vitro flipped SNARE cell fusion assay, we have identified and characterized the minimal functional domains of complexin-I necessary to couple calcium and synaptotagmin-I to membrane fusion. Moreover, we provide evidence that other isoforms of complexin, complexin-II, -III, and -IV, can also be functionally coupled to synaptotagmin-I and calcium.

Vesicle trafficking comprises a highly orchestrated series of protein-protein interactions that culminate in the membrane fusion event (1Mellman I. Warren G. Cell. 2000; 100: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). During the late steps of membrane fusion reaction, the vesicle docks closely and firmly, within molecular contact distance of the target bilayer, as the cognate SNARE 3The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive attachment protein receptor; CPX, complexin; SYT, synaptotagmin; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; aa, amino acids; nls, nuclear localization signal. proteins zip up to form a four-helix bundle between the two membranes (termed a trans-SNARE complex or SNAREpin). When the SNARE complex fully zips up, the bilayers are merged, and the SNARE complex now emanates from the single, combined membrane. In regulated exocytosis, there are additional proteins added to this “core” fusion machinery that appear to freeze the process at intermediate stages and allow rapid mobilization from these intermediates (e.g. upon calcium entry) to allow a prompt bolus of secretion (2Brunger A.T.

SYT is now well described as the primary calcium sensor for SNARE-dependent fusion (reviewed in Refs. 10Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar and 11Koh T.W. Bellen H.J. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). SYTs are vesicle-associated integral membrane proteins with two cytosol-facing calcium-binding C2 domains (12Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Knock-out of mouse SYT1 abolishes the fast synchronous component of calcium-mediated release (13Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Mutations of SYT reduce or eliminate the apparent cooperativity of calcium in exocytosis, alter the vesicle release probability, and shift the calcium sensitivity (14Littleton J.T. Stern M. Perin M.

A series of genetic and electrophysiological experiments place the small soluble protein CPX at the same step in synaptic release as SYT (reviewed in Ref. 16Melia Jr., T.J. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2131-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As with SYT, changing the expression level of CPX impairs evoked exocytosis (17Tokumaru H. Umayahara K. Pellegrini L.L.

Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A sudden influx of calcium into the presynaptic terminal of a neuron leads to a synchronized, rapid release of neurotransmitter via the fusion of docked and primed vesicles (10Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 11Koh T.W. Bellen H.J. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Wojcik S.M. Brose N. Neuron. 2007; 55: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We had suggested, with the discovery of the SNARE proteins, that such a rapid synchronized release might result from a calciumsensitive clamp preventing the complete assembly of SNARE proteins (21Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar). In this way, the vesicles can be brought to the brink of fusion and a relatively mild energetic or kinetic switch could drive full neurotransmitter secretion. We have identified CPX as a protein that can clamp the fusion apparatus and SYT as the calcium sensor that releases this clamp (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Studies from three other groups working in liposomes, cortical neurons (by overexpression), and knock-out cells (from Drosophila) are consistent with this clamp hypothesis (23Schaub J.R. Lu X. Doneske B. Shin Y.K. McNew J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.H. Dai H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1235-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A further prediction of the clamp hypothesis would be that removal of one or the other clamp components (SYT or CPX) should result in an increase in unfettered or spontaneous exocytosis. In fact, spontaneous release is increased in Drosophila knockouts of SYT and CPX (14Littleton J.T. Stern M. Perin M. Bellen H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10888-10892Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 25Huntwork S. Littleton J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1235-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Broadie K.

Neuron. 2005; 48: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). How CPX clamps the SNARE complex and at what stage of assembly are open questions. CPX binds the cis-SNARE complex with a short helical sequence in the middle of the protein (29Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This sequence is sufficient to block exocytosis when appended directly to a SNARE (24Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.H. Dai H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2006; 126: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and mutations in this sequence reduce or eliminate the clamping capacity of CPX (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 24Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.H. Dai H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2006; 126: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Calcium-mediated exocytosis also relies on sequences in other parts of the protein (notably the membrane-proximal N terminus) (30Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), although how these sequences might act functionally is unknown. In this paper, we used an in vitro flipped SNARE cell fusion assay in order to identify and characterize functional domains on CPX-I required either to clamp the fusion reaction or to couple the fusion reaction to calcium and SYT-I. Although the expression of SNAREs and other normally cytoplasmic proteins on the outside of the cell is a decidedly nonphysiologic maneuver, it has the advantage of providing a highly simplified environment to which potential regulatory proteins can be added in a controlled manner. The artificial nature of the system raises potential questions about the physiological relevance of results from this assay. Comparison of results from this system with those obtained from more reductionist or even physiological systems have to date been favorable, and here we allow this comparison to be extended to include functional analysis of domains of CPX. Here we present direct evidence that CPX-I-(26-83) represents the minimal functional domain of CPX-I that preserves both the clamping activity and the calcium/SYT-I sensitivity in vitro. In addition, we show that other isoforms of CPX-glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) (CPX-II-, CPX-III-, and CPX-IV-GPI) can be functionally coupled to SYT-I. We compare these results with those obtained with in vivo systems. Constructs and Stable Cell Lines—To generate GPI-anchored complexin-I deletion constructs, we performed PCR using as a template plasmid CPX-I-GPI (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and the appropriate combination of the set of sense primers, which contains an XbaI site and encodes for an AU1 epitope (DTYRYI) (CPXI26AU1, CACCTCTAGAGACACATACCGATACATAAAGGACCCAGACGCCGCCAAGAAGGAGGAGGAG; CPXI34AU1, CACCTCTAGAGACACATACCGATACATAGAGGAGGAGCGGCAGGAGGCGCTGCGCCAG; CPXI48AU1, CACCTCTAGAGACACATACCGATACATACGCAAGGCCAAGTACGCCAAGATGGAGGCG) and the set of antisense primers, which contains an XhoI site (CPXI48-3′, TTTGGCTCGAGGCGCTCCTCCTCCGCCTGGCG; CPXI70-3′, TTTGGCTCGAGGTACTTGTCTCGGATGCCCTGGCG; CPXI86-3′, TTTGGCTCGAGCTGGGCCTCGGCCTCGCGCTC). The PCR product and the plasmid pCDNA3.1(+) CPX-I-GPI were digested with XbaI and XhoI. Both digestion products were ligated, yielding the indicated CPX-I-GPI deletion constructs. GPI-anchored constructs of human CPX-II and CPX-III or mouse CPX-IV fused to an AU1 epitope were generated using the same strategy as for CPX-I-GPI deletion constructs described above. Site-specific mutations were introduced on CPX-I-GPI using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit-II (Stratagene). HeLa stable cell lines co-expressing flipped SNAREs with the fluorescent protein markers were generated using the Tet-Off gene expression system (31Baron U. Freundlieb S. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3605-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Clontech) as described (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Two different types of SNARE-expressing HeLa cells were mainly used in this paper, cells lines stably expressing flipped VAMP2 and DsRed2-nuclear export signals (v-cells) or cell lines stably expressing flipped syntaxin 1, flipped SNAP-25, and cyan fluorescent protein-nls (t-cells). Cell-Cell Fusion Assay—5.5 × 105 HeLa v-cells grown for at least 3 days in complete medium in the absence of doxycycline (to initiate flipped VAMP2 and DsRed expression) were seeded in a 6-well plate. The next day, the cells were used for transient transfection to express complexin, synaptotagmin, and YFP-nls marker (4 μg of CPX-I-GPI plasmid, 4 μg of flipped Syt-I plasmid, 4 μg of YFP-nls plasmid, and 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)), complexin and the YFP-nls marker (CPX-I-GPI plasmid, 4 μg of YFP-nls plasmid, and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)), or YFP-nls marker alone for control experiments (4 μg of YFP-nls plasmid and 8 μl of Lipofectamine 2000). The same day as the transfection, 4.5 × 104 HeLa t-cells previously grown for at least 5 days in complete medium in the absence of doxycycline (to initiate expression of the flipped t-SNARE subunits and cyan fluorescent protein-nls) were seeded on sterile 12-mm glass coverslips contained in 24-well plates. The following day, transfected HeLa-v cells were detached from the dishes with sodium citrate cell-detaching solution (11 g/liter KCl, 4.4 g/liter sodium citrate). The detached cells were centrifuged at 200 × g and resuspended in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and counted in a hemacytometer. The assay was initiated by adding 5 × 104 v-cells to each coverslip already containing t-cells. After overnight incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the coverslips were gently washed once with HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm dithiothreitol (recovery solution). The recovery from the CPX-I-GPI block was performed by adding prewarmed recovery solution containing 1 unit/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and 20 μg/ml laminin, in the presence or absence of 1.8 mm EGTA (as indicated). The addition of PI-PLC is defined as t = 0. Cells were incubated for the indicated period of time at 37 °C in the water bath, and then the medium was aspirated, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 g/liter CaCl2 and 0.1 g/liter MgCl2 (PBS++) and mounted with Prolong Antifade Gold mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were collected as indicated under “Image Acquisition.” Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant soluble CPX-I, CPX-I-(26-83), and CPX-III were purified following the protocol described in Ref. 22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar. The flow-through after benzamidine treatment was incubated with 50 μl of (100%) benzamidine-Sepharose for 20 min at room temperature to bind thrombin. Benzamidine-Sepharose beads were collected in a spin column, and the flow-through was saved. The flow-through was dialyzed at 4 °C against 1 liter of HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with two changes of media. The dialyzed pool was then concentrated using a Centricon 20 concentrator (Amicon, Millipore) at 4,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4 °C. The concentration of the soluble complexin-I was then determined using the protein determination assay (Bio-Rad), and the purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Image Acquisition—Images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope, equipped with Leica LCS software, and usually using an HCX PL APO ×40, 1.25 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. For higher magnification images, a HCX PL APO ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective was used. The images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Data Analysis—At each time point, the percentage of transfected cells (red cytoplasm expressing the YFP-nls construct in the nucleus) containing blue nuclei (appearing either as a separate blue nucleus, or as “white” nuclei expressing both YFP and cyan fluorescent protein) was determined. Each data point in the paper represents two independent coverslips from which 40-60 separate fields were randomly chosen and imaged. The total number of cells counted per coverslip was 2000-3000. Each experiment is representative of at least two independent experiments. In previous studies using this assay, we recorded fusion as “contacting v- and t-cells that fused” (32Hu C. Ahmed M. Melia T.J. Sollner T.H. Mayer T. Rothman J.E. Science. 2003; 300: 1745-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Giraudo C.G. Hu C. You D. Slovic A.M. Mosharov E.V. Sulzer D. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This metric limits the data to cells that have the opportunity to fuse with a cognate SNARE-expressing cell. Unfortunately, this requires an additional color marker to define the plasma membrane of the t-cells (or to fill the cytosol of the t-SNARE such that the shape of the cell is obvious). In the experiments presented in this paper, no additional color was available in the t-cell, and as such the total efficiency should be considered an underestimate of the actual cell-cell fusion efficiency. In experiments following just the stable cells and utilizing a content marker to discern t-cell shape, the actual efficiency of contacting cells fusing was comparable with previous measures. Binding Experiments—t-cells were transiently co-transfected with flipped Vamp2 and the indicated CPX-I-GPI mutant construct or mock-transfected, and they were incubated with or without 500 milliunits/ml PI-PLC for 30 min, washed, fixed, and stained with anti-AU1 antibody. Total fluorescent intensity from individual cells in images was determined. Functional Domains in Complexin-I That Control SNARE-mediated Fusion—CPX-I protein is a small (15-kDa) soluble protein composed of 134 residues with an overall acidic pH. Secondary structure predictions showed a high α-helix content, the central α-helix (aa 29-71) being the most prominent (Fig. 1A). The crystal structure data of CPX-I bound to the cis-SNARE complex (29Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 34Bracher A. Kadlec J. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26517-26523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reveals that within this central α-helix reside the amino acids that physically interact with the SNARE bundle (residues 48-70). To delineate functional requirements for domains of CPX-I and SYT-I in calcium control of SNARE-dependent fusion, we have designed a series of deletion constructs of CPX-I-GPI. The first sets of serial deletions span both the N terminus and C terminus of CPX-I, including the accessory α-helix (aa 29-48), which was partially solved in the crystal structure CPX-I·SNARE complex, and the central α-helix (aa 48-70) (Fig. 1B). Each shortened deletion variant was fused to a GPI anchor motif in order to concentrate CPX-I on the cell surface (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Expression of these constructs on the cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence (data not shown), and their effect on cell fusion activity was analyzed using the flipped SNARE assay (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this assay, HeLa v-cells expressing flipped Vamp2 and DsRed protein fused to nuclear export signals were transfected with YFP-nls (co-transfection marker) and with or without a CPX-I-GPI wild type or deletion construct. After 24 h of expression, cells were seeded on top of HeLa t-cells attached to coverslips expressing flipped syntaxin-1, flipped SNAP-25, and the cyan fluorescent protein fused to nuclear localization signals. Cells were incubated overnight, and the fusion efficiency was quantified as a percentage of transfected v-cells that fused. Deletion of the first 47 residues of CPX-I (CPX-I-(48-134)-GPI) resulted in a nearly complete loss of the clamping effect of CPX-I (Fig. 1, C and D). In stark contrast, deletion of the C-terminal half of CPX-I (CPX-I-(1-70)-GPI) produced only a modest loss of function. Similar to previous observations with full-length CPX-I, the clamping effect of CPX-I-(1-70)-GPI could be fully reversed by cleaving CPX-I off of the GPI anchor, in the presence of calcium and SYT-I with PI-PLC. Likewise, the construct CPX-I-(26-83)-GPI (the domain previously used for the crystallization studies (29Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar)) could both clamp cell fusion and be reversed with PI-PLC, Ca2+/SYT-I. Further deletion at the amino terminus (CPX-I-(48-70)-GPI and CPX-I-(34-70)-GPI) resulted in inactive CPX-I fragments (i.e. no clamping). Thus, the region 26-83 of CPX-I constitutes the minimal clamping domain for coupling calcium control with SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. This domain consists of a SNARE binding region or central α-helix (aa 48-70) and of an accessory α-helix (aa 26-48). Both regions were mutually necessary to impart calcium sensitivity to the SNARE-mediated cell fusion, since constructs of other helix alone (CPX-I-(48-70)-GPI and CPX-I-(26-83)-GPI) did not affect the extent of cell fusion. Functional Domains in Complexins and Synaptotagmin-I That Interact in Calcium Control—In addition to CPX-I and CPX-II, which are mainly enriched in neurons, two other CPX isoforms were identified: CPX-III and CPX-IV, which are mainly expressed in retina, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cortex, inferior colliculus, thalamus, and striatum (19Reim K. Mansour M. Varogueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 35Reim K. Wegmeyer H. Brandstatter J.H. Xue M. Rosenmund C. Dresbach T. Hofmann K. Brose N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The CPX-III and -IV subfamily share a CAAX C-terminal farnesylation motif and a 10-12-aa insertion at the N-terminal region. Despite these differences, CPX-III and CPX-IV can functionally rescue the calcium-evoked release in neurons derived from CPX-I/II double knock-out mice, thus emphasizing a high level of functional redundancy. To better define functional domains of SYT-I and CPX-I that interact in calcium control, we studied the specificity of SYT-I for controlling calcium-stimulated fusion, using different combinations of the various CPXs and neuronal v- and t-SNAREs. First, we generated and characterized the expression of GPI-anchored versions of all known mammalian CPXs (CPX-I through -IV) (Fig. 2A). Then we compared the effect of CPX-I through -IV on cell-cell fusion using the flipped SNARE cell fusion assay. In agreement with previous rescue experiments (35Reim K. Wegmeyer H. Brandstatter J.H. Xue M. Rosenmund C. Dresbach T. Hofmann K. Brose N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), our results showed that all four CPXs inhibited the cell fusion reaction mediated by neuronal SNAREs to approximately the same extent. Moreover, the inhibition exerted by all CPX isoforms was partially reverted after cleavage of the GPI anchor. In all cases, SYT-I enhanced the cell fusion recovery in a Ca2+-dependent manner to levels comparable with CPX-I. These results not only provide direct evidence that the neuronal SNARE complexes can be the target for CPX-I through -IV but also provide evidence that SYT-I can confer calcium sensitivity to the fusion reaction halted by each isoform. To further characterize the minimal-clamping domain of CPX-I and different isoforms of CPX, we compared the effect of soluble forms of CPX (i.e. without a GPI anchor; sCPX-I) on the cell fusion assay. Soluble CPX-I also inhibited cell-cell fusion when applied at sufficient concentrations and did so in a dose-dependent manner (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although CPX-III is naturally prenylated, it also inhibited as a soluble protein, as did the minimal clamping domain of CPX-I. Both sCPX-I-(26-83) and sCPX-III inhibited the cell fusion reaction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The efficiency of inhibition did not differ significantly from sCPX-I. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Conserved Residues in CPX-I, -II, -III, and -IV—Previous biochemical and structural studies have identified the central α-helical region as responsible for the physical interaction with the SNARE complexes (29Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 34Bracher A. Kadlec J. Betz H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19808-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Crystal structure data show how a truncated form of CPX (comprising residues 32-72) intercalates in an antiparallel fashion in the groove between VAMP2 and syntaxin-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). The interaction of CPX-I with the SNARE complex involves hydrogen bonds (residues Tyr52 and Tyr70), salt bridges (Arg48, Arg59, Arg63, and Lys69), and hydrophobic interactions (Met62 and Ile66). It is yet unknown whether these residues are essential to the clamped state, where trans-SNARE complexes embedded in biological membranes are the target rather than truncated, isolated cis-SNARE bundles. Here, we tested the importance of conserved residues within the central helical region of CPX-I through CPX-IV that may play a role in either the clamping effect of CPX-I or in the SYT-I/Ca2+ release. Residues conserved within the central helical region across the four CPXs were identified in an alignment plot of CPX sequences from different species (Fig. 3C). The conserved amino acids within the central region of CPX-I where three-dimensional structure data are available were classified either as residues facing the SNAREpin (and therefore potentially playing a role in stabilizing SNARE-complexin interactions) or residues facing away from the SNARE complex (and potentially involved in complexin-lipid or complexin-synaptotagmin interactions) (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). First, we established whether the CPX-I mutants or deletion constructs preserved their ability to bind to cis-SNARE complexes present on the cell surface. For this purpose, HeLa t-cells were co-transfected with the desired CPX-I deletion/mutant construct and with a plasmid encoding for flipped VAMP2 in order to form cis-SNARE complexes on the cell surface. Afterward, CPX-I-GPI was cleaved off from its GPI anchor motif using PI-PLC, and the remaining CPX-I bound on the cell surface was determined by immunofluorescence using an anti-AU1 antibody (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As predicted by the structural data, the central α-helical region (aa 48-70) was indispensable for the interaction with SNARE complexes (30Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 36Pabst S. Margittai M. Vainius D. Langen R. Jahn R. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7838-7848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 37Pabst S. Hazzard J.W. Antonin W. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Rizo J. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19808-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations of the amino acids on CPX-I that are thought to contact the SNARE complex (R59H, R48A, R63A, and Y70A) showed a strong reduction in the binding capacity (Fig. 4); however, mutation of other residues facing the SNAREpin but not making contact with (R37A or R67A) or residues facing away from the SNAREpin (E36A, Q43A, E46A, A50W, A57W, or D68A) did not alter the binding capacity to SNARE complexes (Fig. 4). Therefore, membrane-incorporated cis-SNAREs bind CPX in a similar manner as soluble cis-SNARE bundles. Next, we tested the capacity of each of these point mutants to clamp cell-cell fusion. Conserved residues facing the SNARE-pin were Arg37, Arg48, Arg59, Arg63, Arg67, and Tyr70 (Fig. 3A). Of the SNAREpin-facing mutants, four (Arg48, Arg59, Arg63, and Tyr70) are involved in the interaction with the cis-SNARE complex, whereas Arg67 and Arg37 are not. Data from our functional flipped SNARE fusion assay correlated well with the structural data and showed a profound decrease in the clamping effect of the SNARE interaction mutants R48A, R63A, and Y70A. On the other hand, clamping effects of CPX-I mutants R67A and R37A were functionally indistinguishable from that of the CPX-I wild type (Fig. 3D). Neither R67A nor R37A mutants showed an altered Ca2+/SYT-I fusion recovery after the addition of PI-PLC. These results support the fact that the functional approach is sensitive and specific enough to detect minor changes in the regulatory machinery. When we introduced the outward facing mutations E36A, Q43A, E46A, A50W, A57W, or D68A (Fig. 3B), neither the clamping effect of CPX-I nor the calcium sensitivity conferred by SYT-I was significantly affected (Fig. 3C). The Minimal Clamping Domain of CPX-I Preserves the SYT-I/Calcium Sensitivity—Recent rescue experiments using neurons derived from CPX-I/-II double knock-out mice have suggested that the first 26 residues of CPX-I have a crucial facilitating function in vesicle release that may be associated with a novel interaction (30Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To further test in vitro the requirement of the N-terminal region of CPX-I for SYT-I/calcium sensitivity, we compared the cell fusion recovery of the minimum clamping domain of CPX-I (residues 26-83) with the wild type form of CPX-I-GPI. To this end, we performed a classical cell fusion experiment (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation, we incubated the cells with EGTA for 5 min and then incubated for an additional 5 min with PI-PLC. Finally, cells were treated with or without calcium, and the cell fusion recovery was analyzed over time. Results showed that the calcium/SYT-I-dependent recovery of the SNARE-mediated fusion of CPX-I-(26-83)-GPI was almost indistinguishable from that of CPX-I (wild type)-GPI (Fig. 5). These results established that CPX-I-(26-83) can fully recapitulate the calcium-regulated SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. In regulated exocytosis, the core membrane fusion machinery, SNARE proteins, is assisted by a group of regulatory factors in order to couple membrane fusion to particular stimuli, such as an increase of intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration. The functions of these factors in regulated exocytosis are largely unknown due to a lack of mechanistic studies in minimal functional fusion systems. Here, by using the cell fusion system in which “flipped” v- and t-SNAREs needed in exocytosis are co-expressed on the cell surface with different regulatory factors, we have identified and characterized the minimal functional domain of CPX-I that confers calcium sensitivity to the fusion reaction. The cell fusion system provides several key advantages. First, the fusion involves a biological membrane but without the complexity of the cytosol, so the functions of individual regulatory proteins can be assessed in a biologically relevant environment. Second, the regulators can be co-expressed with SNAREs such that the topology is maintained. Third, individual fusion events can be imaged to detect subpopulations of distinct fusion outcomes, and fusion can be followed in real time to allow the observation of relatively stable transient fusion intermediates, such as hemifusion (33Giraudo C.G. Hu C. You D. Slovic A.M. Mosharov E.V. Sulzer D. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Fourth, we have previously shown that the calcium-dependent membrane fusion reaction can be fully recapitulated using this in vitro fusion system (22Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Comparison of results from the flipped SNARE system with those obtained from physiological systems has to date been favorable, and here we allow this comparison to be extended to include functional analysis of domains of CPX with broad agreement with in vivo results (30Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our studies using CPX-I truncation constructs revealed that the N-terminal region of CPX-I is crucial for both the clamping effect on cell fusion and for the SYT-I/calcium-dependent fusion recovery. More precisely, the minimal functional domain of CPX-I we have identified that remains able to reconstitute the SYT-I/calcium-dependent fusion comprised residues 26-83 (Fig. 1D). Recent studies proposed that calcium-regulated exocytosis relies also on sequences in other parts of the protein (notably the membrane-proximal N terminus) (30Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These studies, in agreement with our results, attributed an inhibitory effect to an accessory helix of CPX-I because of the failure of a CPX-I-(27-134) construct to rescue the CPX-I/-II double knock-out phenotype. However, the authors speculate that the first 26 residues of CPX-I have a positive role on the fast calcium-regulated exocytosis in the absence of SYT-I. They also hypothesize that the positive role of the N-terminal region of CPX-I is mediated by interaction with a missing factor. Nonetheless, the authors cannot rule out the compensation of other SYT and or CPX isoforms in vivo. In stark contrast with this hypothesis, our results provide direct evidences that the minimal functional domain of CPX-I (residues 26-83) can recapitulate the SNARE-mediated calcium/SYT-I-dependent fusion in vitro without the need of any other accessory proteins. Combining our functional data from the cell fusion system together with the information from the crystal structure of the CPX-I·SNARE complex (29Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) strongly supports the model that binding of CPX-I to SNARE complex through residues 48-70 is a requisite for CPX-I to function but is not sufficient. The SNARE-facing residues Arg48, Arg59, Arg63, and Tyr70 are all conserved among different CPXs from different species and are essential to both binding and clamping, suggesting that the binding mechanism of other CPX isoforms to the SNAREpin may be conserved. Rescue experiments in CPX-I/-II double knock-out neurons using CPX-III and -IV constructs suggest a functional redundancy of different CPX isoforms (35Reim K. Wegmeyer H. Brandstatter J.H. Xue M. Rosenmund C. Dresbach T. Hofmann K. Brose N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous results, data presented here establish that CPX-I through -IV can each block a cell fusion reaction involving neuronal SNAREs with similar efficiencies. In addition, each CPX-I through -IV fusion blockage can be reverted by the same calcium sensor protein, SYT-I."
https://openalex.org/W2000100263,"RNA processing is altered during malignant transformation, and expression of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is often increased in cancer cells. Although some data support that PTB promotes cancer, the functional contribution of PTB to the malignant phenotype remains to be clarified. Here we report that although PTB levels are generally increased in cancer cell lines from multiple origins and in endometrial adenocarcinoma tumors, there appears to be no correlation between PTB levels and disease severity or metastatic capacity. The three isoforms of PTB increase heterogeneously among different tumor cells. PTB knockdown in transformed cells by small interfering RNA decreases cellular growth in monolayer culture and to a greater extent in semi-solid media without inducing apoptosis. Down-regulation of PTB expression in a normal cell line reduces proliferation even more significantly. Reduction of PTB inhibits the invasive behavior of two cancer cell lines in Matrigel invasion assays but enhances the invasive behavior of another. At the molecular level, PTB in various cell lines differentially affects the alternative splicing pattern of the same substrates, such as caspase 2. Furthermore, overexpression of PTB does not enhance proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, or invasion in immortalized or normal cells. These data demonstrate that PTB is not oncogenic and can either promote or antagonize a malignant trait dependent upon the specific intra-cellular environment.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, PTB shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (21Kamath R.V. Leary D.J. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3808-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is regulated through phosphorylation by 3′,5′-cAMP-dependent protein kinase (22Xie J. Lee J.-A. Kress T.L. Mowry K.L. Black D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8776-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing is a process that allows multiple different proteins to be made from the same pre-mRNA by either including or excluding particular exons during pre-mRNA splicing. PTB plays a key role in alternative site selection for many gene products by acting as a splicing repressor that prevents the inclusion of target exons (11Robinson F. Smith C.W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Gromak N. Matlin A.J. Cooper T.A. Smith C.W. RNA (N.

Biol. 2006; 26: 8755-8769Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Changes in alternative splicing sites have been previously correlated with malignant transformation (26Jin W. McCutcheon I.E. Fuller G.N. Huang E.S. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1221-1224PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jin W. Bruno I.G. Xie T.-X. Sanger L.J. Cote G.J.

Hentschel S.J. Fuller G.N. Jin W. Cote G.J. Neuro-Oncol. 2004; 6: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the expression level of PTB has been found elevated in transformed cells. Such an elevation is responsible for the increases in fibroblast growth factor receptor-1α-exon skipping in glioblastoma multiforme tumors (26Jin W. McCutcheon I.E. Fuller G.N. Huang E.S. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1221-1224PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in PTB expression are also associated with changes in alternative splicing of multidrug resistance protein 1, which contributes to the drug-resistant phenotype associated with many cancers (28He X. Ee P.L. Coon J.S. Beck W.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4652-4660Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to PTB, changes in the expression levels of other factors involved in alternative splicing, such as SR proteins, have been found to impact the metastatic phenotype. A classic example demonstrated that a CD44 splice variant, CD44 v6, confers metastatic potential when expressed in nonmetastatic cells (30Gunthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zoller M. Haussmann I. Matzku S. Wenzel A. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1991; 65: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in alternative splicing dynamics in tumor cells likely modify gene expression, in which the expression of functionally altered proteins may directly contribute to the malignant phenotype (31Venables J.P. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Being a splice repressor, PTB may influence the transformed phenotype through changing alternative splicing patterns. PTB itself also undergoes alternative splicing and has three splicing isoforms. PTB1 is the smallest, whereas PTB2 and -4 have an additional 19 or 26 amino acids, respectively, between RRM 2 and 3 as a result of exon 9 inclusion (1Ghetti A. Pinol-Roma S. Michael W.M. Morandi C. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3671-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 2Gil A. Sharp P.A. Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1224-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These isoforms are differentially effective in the alternative splicing of α-tropomyosin. PTB4 has strongest influence and PTB1 the weakest on exon 3 skipping in vivo and in vitro (32Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E.C. Jackson R.J. Smith C.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, differential splicing efficiency of the individual PTB isoforms is not observed for all PTB substrates, as demonstrated by the equal efficiency of α-actinin exon skipping by all isoforms (32Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E.C. Jackson R.J. Smith C.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, the differential expression of PTB isoforms may enormously influence gene expression because of the large number of PTB substrates present in the cell and thus differentially affect cellular behavior based on the amount of certain PTB substrates that are expressed in a given cell type. Although several studies have demonstrated altered PTB expression in cancer cells (31Venables J.P. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 33Faustino N.A. Cooper T.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 419-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), fundamental questions regarding the role of PTB in cancer cells remain unresolved. It is not clear whether increased PTB expression is a phenomenon common to cancers of all origins, or whether PTB isoform expression changes similarly among cancers from different origins, or whether increased PTB expression is important for the transformed phenotype. Recently, a study using siRNA knockdown technique demonstrated that PTB promotes the malignant phenotype in ovarian tumor cell lines (34He X. Pool M. Darcy K.M. Lim S.B. Auersperg N. Coon J.S. Beck W.T. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further address these issues, we investigated the changes in PTB expression in cancer cells from multiple origins and compared the PTB isoform profiles in these cells. We examined the role of PTB in malignant transformation by knocking down PTB expression in cultured tumor and nontransformed cells. We found that PTB levels generally increase in cancer cells from a variety of tissues; however, the expression levels of the three individual PTB isoforms are heterogeneous among different cell types. PTB knockdown by siRNA significantly reduces the growth rate for both cancer and normal cell lines, and reduces anchorage-independent growth in tumor cells to a great extent than monolayer culture. In addition, PTB knockdown inhibits the invasive capacity of two cancer cell lines but increased invasion in another. However, overexpression of PTB in normal and immortalized cells does not increase proliferation or induce traits associated with transformation in vitro. Our findings suggest that PTB itself is not transforming but may support or interfere with malignancy depending on the specific cellular environment as it can promote transformed phenotypes in some cells while antagonizing them in others. Cell Culture and Tissue Specimens—HeLa (human cervical cancer), Wacar and Homa (normal human skin fibroblasts), HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney transformed with adenovirus 5 DNA), and NIH-3T3 (Mus musculus, fibroblasts) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. PC-3, PC-3M, PC-3M Pro4, and PC-3M LN4 prostate cancer cell lines were generous gifts from the laboratories of Dr. Zhou Wang and Dr. Chung Lee (Northwestern University) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. WI-38 normal lung fibroblasts were grown in minimal essential medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin unless otherwise noted. CG cells (human neuroblastoma), T84 cells (human colon carcinoma), and SAOS-2 (osteosarcoma) were cultured according to the protocols provided by ATCC Cultures™. Stably expressing NIH-3T3 cells were created by transfecting ∼2 × 106 cells with 2 μg of either PTB1-GFP vector (39Wang C. Politz J.C. Pederson T. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or constitutively active K-Ras vector (courtesy of Dr. William Hahn-Addgene plasmid 9051) or 2 μg of each at the same time and then selecting with 500 μg/ml G-418 (PTB-GFP) and/or 5 μg/ml puromycin (H-Ras) for 2 weeks. The resulting stable, nonclonal cell lines were utilized for assays within 1 month of creation. Human endometrial tissue samples were obtained by surgical resection, trypsinized, and seeded in culture (Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University). Histopathological examination allowed the samples to be classified as benign, grade-1, grade-2, or grade-3 endometrial tumors. All cell culture products were obtained from Invitrogen, and all other reagents mentioned under “Materials and Methods” were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Immunostaining—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min followed by 5 min of permeabilization with 0.5% w/v Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature. Primary antibody was applied for 1 h, and cells were washed with PBS three times for 10 min. The primary antibody, SH54 (anti-PTB) (35Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), was used at a 1:300 dilution in PBS, and secondary anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red were used at a 1:200 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Coverslips were analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a SenSys cooled CCD camera (Photometrics). Images were captured using Metamorph image acquisition software (Universal Imaging). Protein Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein extracts were prepared by sonicating tissue or cells in RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, sodium salt, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of each protein sample were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies used for Western blot analysis were rabbit or mouse anti-PTB (SH54) at a 1:800 dilution, rabbit anti-actin (Sigma) at a 1:2000 dilution, mouse anti-GFP (BD Biosciences) at a 1:1000 dilution, rabbit anti-K-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:500 dilution, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:10,000 dilution. SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) detection reagents were used to detect immunoreactive bands. Northern Blotting—To determine the RNA expression level of PTB in different cell lines by Northern analysis, total RNAs were extracted from different cell lines with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAs from different cell lines were loaded (5 μg/lane) and run on a 1% agarose gel and subsequently transferred onto GeneScreenPlus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary action with a high salt solution. Hybridization and washing conditions were standard as described previously (36Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pp. 7.39-7.52, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). A 32P-labeled PTB probe was used to detect the expression level of RNA with labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe used as loading control. 32P was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. RT-PCR—RNA was converted to cDNA, and the DNA was amplified by PCR with a forward primer (5′-ACCAGCCTCAACGTCAAGTA) and a reverse primer (5′-GGGTTGAGGTTGCTGACCAG) in a single reaction. These primers were designed to include the alternatively spliced region of PTB so ratios of isoforms could be directly compared among cell lines. Reverse transcription was performed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) on total RNA obtained via TRIzol isolation from cell lines. PCR was carried out with 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 90 s. The PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. The intensity of the isoform bands were measured with Kodak MI software, which allowed for determination of isoform ratios. Alternative Splicing Efficiency Assay—A caspase 2 minigene was used as described previously (37Cote J. Dupuis S. Jiang Z. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were plated onto 6-well culture plates at 60–70% confluence. After 24 h, 4 μg of GFP-tagged PTB expression vectors and 1 μg of reporter minigene were introduced into cells by a standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. Total RNA was purified with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) from 6-well culture plates 36 h after transfection. Alternative splicing products of the caspase 2 minigene were detected using RT-PCR in the presence of [32P]dCTP (GE Healthcare) as described previously (37Cote J. Dupuis S. Jiang Z. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Zhang W.-J. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PCR products were fractionated with 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE buffer and then detected and quantified using a PhosphorImager BAS-1800II (Fuji Film). RNA Interference—Double-stranded RNA was chemically synthesized, deprotected, and purified by Dharmacon Research, Inc. One strand of the double-stranded RNA was homologous to the PTB mRNA sequence 5′-UGACAAGAGCCGUGACUAC(dTdT)-3′. The scramble control siRNA was from Ambion, Inc. (Silencer® negative control 2 siRNA). Transfection of siRNA duplexes into various cell lines was conducted as described previously according to the manufacturer's instructions (Oligofectamine reagent, Invitrogen) (39Wang C. Politz J.C. Pederson T. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were utilized for subsequent experiments 72 h post-transfection. In Vivo Br-UTP Incorporation—Seventy two hours after transfection with PTB siRNA, cells were rinsed once in Glycerol Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and permeabilized in the Glycerol Buffer with 50 μg/ml digitonin for 3 min. Cells were then incubated in transcription mixture (100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.2 mm Br-UTP) at 37 °C for 5 min and then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Fixed cells were double-labeled with anti-PTB at a 1:300 dilution and anti-BrdUrd that also recognizes Br-UTP (Sigma) at a 1:50 dilution and subsequently prepared as described above. Anchorage-independent Growth Assay—Seventy two hours after transfection, cells from the PTB siRNA and the control siRNA-treated dishes were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. The same number of cells (about 5 × 104) from all experimental conditions were added into 2 ml of 1.5% (w/v) methylcellulose media and seeded onto 1% agarosecoated 35-mm Petri dishes and allowed to grow for 10 days. At this point, pictures were taken using phase microscopy to show the colony formation. Then the media containing the cells were removed from the dish, put in a 15-ml tube, vigorously pipetted and vortexed to break up the colonies, allowed to sit for 5 min, and then gently mixed as to suspend the cells homogeneously while avoiding air bubbles. The cell number relative to control was determined by measuring the scattering at 650 nm using a spectrophotometer (Beckman DU-64). Invasion Assay—Invasive activity was determined via the transwell Matrigel invasion (Boyden chamber) assay. Transwell inserts (0.8 μm; BD Biosciences) were coated with Matrigel (100 μg in 100 μl, for 1 h at room temperature), and coated inserts were then washed with PBS and used immediately. Seventy two hours after siRNA transfection, 2 × 105 cells from each experimental condition were added to the upper chamber in 500 μl of serum-free medium. Twenty four hours after incubation at 37 °C, the noninvading cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab, and invading cells adherent to the bottom of membrane were fixed and stained using a Diff-Quick staining kit (DADE AG). Invading cells were counted by tallying the number of cells in 10 random fields under a ×20 objective using an ocular micrometer. Data were expressed as average relative (compared with control) number of migrating cells in 10 fields from six experiments (40Ghosh S. Munshi H.G. Sen R. Linz-McGillem L.A. Goldman R.D. Lorch J. Green K.J. Jones J.C. Stack M.S. Cancer. 2002; 95: 2524-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasminogen Activator Assay—Net plasminogen activator activity in conditioned media was quantified using a coupled assay to monitor plasminogen activation and the resulting plasmin hydrolysis of a colorimetric substrate (d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide; Sigma) as described previously (41Stack S. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42Ghosh S. Brown R. Jones J.C. Ellerbroek S.M. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23869-23876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transformed Cell Lines and Cancer Tissues Express Increased Levels of PTB—To evaluate the expression level of PTB in tumor cell lines and human tissue samples, we used both immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. For the immunofluorescent staining, tumor and normal cells were immunolabeled in parallel, and the images were captured under the same image acquisition settings. The results show a significant increase in nuclear labeling intensity in tumor cells over that in normal cells as exemplified in PC-3M (a human prostate cancer cell line), HeLa (human cervical cancer), CG cells (human neuroblastoma), SAOS-2 (osteosarcoma), versus WI-38 (a normal human lung fibroblast cell line) (Fig. 1A). Many malignant cells also contain the perinucleolar compartment (Fig. 1A, arrowheads), a nuclear structure that is highly enriched with PTB (43Kopp K. Huang S. J. Cell Biochem. 2005; 95: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To quantify the expression of total PTB protein in cancer cell lines from various tissue origins, we performed Western blotting using the anti-PTB antibody SH54 (35Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The panel of human cancer cells examined (HeLa, CG, T84, SAOS-2, HEK-293, PC-3, PC-3M, PC-3M LN4, and PC-3M Pro4) was derived from a broad spectrum of tissue types and represents cells of varying degrees of malignancy. The normal cell lines evaluated were WI-38 and Homa, which are human fibroblasts. Western blotting demonstrates that the level of PTB protein is generally increased in transformed cell lines examined when compared with the normal cell lines (Fig. 2B). The increases in protein expression is consistent with the increased level of steady state PTB mRNA in tumor cells as measured by Northern blotting (Fig. 1B). Densitometry quantification of the PTB protein levels shows that most tumor cell lines express PTB at a level 2-fold, or greater, than normal cells (data not shown). To evaluate whether the increases in PTB levels are correlated with the degree of malignancy, we compared PTB expression in three prostate cancer cell lines of varying levels of malignancy with the parental PC-3 line. PC-3 cells were originally isolated from a human prostate cancer, and PC-3M was created by implanting a PC-3 xenograft tumor into a nude mouse, allowing distant metastases to form, and subsequently removing a metastatic lesion to culture (44Kozlowski J.M. Fidler I.J. Campbell D. Xu Z.L. Kaighn M.E. Hart I.R. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3522-3529PubMed Google Scholar). PC-3M LN4 is enriched with highly metastatic cells through four iterations of inoculating PC-3M cells into the mouse prostate and isolating the metastatic tumor cells. In contrast, PC-3M Pro4 is highly concentrated with nonmetastatic tumor cells through four iterations of inoculating PC-3M cells into mouse prostate and isolating tumor cells localized to the prostate (45Pettaway C.A. Pathak S. Greene G. Ramirez E. Wilson M.R. Killion J.J. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1627-1636PubMed Google Scholar). If PTB level is directly related to the metastatic capacity, we would expect PTB expression in the PC-3 panel of cell lines to correlate with their metastatic capacity; however, PTB is expressed at a higher level in the PC-3M cells compared with PC-3 cells, and there is little difference among the three PC-3M derivatives (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Differential expression patterns of PTB isoforms. A, schematic illustration of PTB isoforms and PCR primers used to detect all PTB splicing isoforms. B, Western blotting shows PTB levels are generally higher in transformed cell lines when compared with normal cell lines. The shortest isoform, PTB1, shows significant increases in all cancer cell lines tested compared with normal cells, in which PTB1 is often below the level of detection. The normal cell lines used were WI-38 (lung fibroblasts) and Homa (human skin fibroblasts). C, quantitative RT-PCR shows that the ratio of PTB1:PTB2 is substantially increased in some tumor cell lines but not in all.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the expression of PTB in human tumor tissues, we examined the levels of PTB expression in freshly isolated normal endometrial and endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. PTB expression in cells isolated from five adenocarcinoma tissues of varying grades was compared with two normal endometrial tissue cells by Western blotting, and the results show the total level of PTB is increased in tumor tissues, which is consistent with the observations in cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C). However, there is no obvious correlation between the expression level of PTB and tumor grades as exemplified by the grade 3 tumor samples, in which one shows a substantial increase in PTB expression although the other is comparable with or slightly less than the grade 1 tumor (Fig. 1C). The lack of correlation between the levels of PTB and the severity of the disease are consistent with the findings from the prostate cancer PC-3 cell line derivatives (Fig. 2B). Together, these data demonstrate that PTB levels generally increase in cancer"

https://openalex.org/W2007338825,"alpha(2)-Macroglobulin (alpha(2)M) is a plasma protease inhibitor, which reversibly binds growth factors and, in its activated form, binds to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1), an endocytic receptor with cell signaling activity. Because distinct domains in alpha(2)M are responsible for its various functions, we hypothesized that the overall effects of alpha(2)M on cell physiology reflect the integrated activities of multiple domains, some of which may be antagonistic. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the growth factor carrier site and the LRP-1 recognition domain (RBD) as separate GST fusion proteins (FP3 and FP6, respectively). FP6 rapidly and robustly activated Akt and ERK/MAP kinase in Schwann cells and PC12 cells. This response was blocked by LRP-1 gene silencing or by co-incubation with the LRP-1 antagonist, receptor-associated protein. The activity of FP6 also was blocked by mutating Lys(1370) and Lys(1374), which precludes LRP-1 binding. FP3 blocked activation of Akt and ERK/MAP kinase in response to nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) but not FP6. In PC12 cells, FP6 promoted neurite outgrowth and expression of growth-associated protein-43, whereas FP3 antagonized the same responses when NGF-beta was added. The ability of FP6 to trigger LRP-1-dependent cell signaling in PC12 cells was reproduced by the 18-kDa RBD, isolated from plasma-purified alpha(2)M by proteolysis and chromatography. We propose that the effects of intact alpha(2)M on cell physiology reflect the degree of penetration of activities associated with different domains, such as FP3 and FP6, which may be regulated asynchronously by conformational change and by other regulatory proteins in the cellular microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2090596937,"In addition to its conventional role during protein synthesis, eukaryotic elongation factor 1A is involved in other cellular processes. Several regions of interaction between eukaryotic elongation factor 1A and the translational apparatus or the cytoskeleton have been identified, yet the roles of the different post-translational modifications of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A are completely unknown. One amino acid modification, which so far has only been found in eukaryotic elongation factor 1A, consists of ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol attached to two glutamate residues that are conserved between mammals and plants. We now report that ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol is also present in eukaryotic elongation factor 1A of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, indicating that this unique protein modification is of ancient origin. In addition, using RNA-mediated gene silencing against enzymes of the Kennedy pathway, we demonstrate that phosphatidylethanolamine is a direct precursor of the ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol moiety. Down-regulation of the expression of ethanolamine kinase and ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase results in inhibition of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in T. brucei procyclic forms and, concomitantly, in a block in glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to procyclins and ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol modification of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A.

Down-regulation of the expression of ethanolamine kinase and ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase results in inhibition of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in T. brucei procyclic forms and, concomitantly, in a block in glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to procyclins and ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol modification of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A. Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) 2The abbreviations used are: eEF1A, eukaryotic elongation factor 1A; EPG, ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol; Etn, ethanolamine; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; RNAi, RNA interference; Etn-P, ethanolamine-phosphate; CDP-Etn, CDP-ethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; HA, hemagglutinin; CM, chloroform:methanol; CMW, chloroform:methanol:water; GPI-phospholipase D, GPI-specific phospholipase D; MALDI-Tof/Tof, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. is a member of the G-protein family and represents an essential component during protein synthesis by binding aminoacyl-tRNAs in a GTP-dependent reaction to the acceptor site of ribosomes during peptide chain elongation (1Negrutskii B.S.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5360-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of eEF1A in complex with components of the nucleotide exchange factor eEF1B have recently been reported (4Andersen G.R. Valente L. Pedersen L. Kinzy T.G. Nyborg J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Andersen G.R. Nissen P. Nyborg J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 434-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Besides its role during protein synthesis, eEF1A is involved in other cellular processes. It has long been proposed that eEF1A associates with and modulates microtubules and actin filaments in several cell types (1Negrutskii B.S. El'skaya A.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 47-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 6Condeelis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 169-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, only recently could it be demonstrated that the conventional role of yeast eEF1A in protein synthesis and its non-canonical role in cytoskeleton organization clearly are separate functions (7Gross S.R. Kinzy T.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that eEF1A, at least in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, has yet another role in mediating the specificity of mitochondrial tRNA import (8Bouzaidi-Tiali N. Aeby E. Charriere F. Pusnik M. Schneider A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4302-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Almost 20 years ago, two groups independently showed that eEF1A from a human erythroleukemia cell line (9Rosenberry T.L. Krall J.A. Dever T.E. Haas R. Louvard D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7096-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a murine lymphocyte cell line (10Whiteheart S.W. Shenbagamurthi P. Chen L. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14334-14341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is modified by ethanolamine-phosphoglycerol (EPG), which is covalently attached to two conserved glutamate residues in the polypeptide chain (Fig. 1). Subsequently, the same modification was found in plant (11Ransom W.D. Lao P.-C. Gage D.A. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but not yeast (12Cavallius J. Zoll W. Chakraburtty K. Merrick W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), eEF1A. The discovery of the EPG modification was prompted by the observation that a 49-kDa cytosolic protein was labeled after incubation of mammalian cells in culture with tritiated ethanolamine (Etn) (9Rosenberry T.L. Krall J.A. Dever T.E. Haas R. Louvard D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7096-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Whiteheart S.W. Shenbagamurthi P. Chen L. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14334-14341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an approach that was originally aimed at identifying glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Etn is a component of the GPI core structure consisting of ethanolamine-phosphate-6-mannose-α1,2-mannose-α1,6-mannose-α1,4-glucosamine-α1,6-myo-inositol-1-phospholipid (13Ferguson M.A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway of Etn incorporation into GPI-anchored proteins involves uptake into cells via choline/ethanolamine transporter, incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) via common phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, transfer of the Etn moiety from PE onto a GPI precursor lipid, and attachment of the GPI to a polypeptide precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum (14Eisenhaber B. Maurer-Stroh S. Novatchkova M. Schneider G. Eisenhaber F. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Orlean P. Menon A.K. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 993-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Incorporation of tritiated ethanolamine into protein has also been observed for another lipid-modified protein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (17Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). This protein, together with its yeast homologue Atg8, is modified by PE, which renders these proteins membrane-bound (17Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 18Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The attachment of PE to a C-terminal glycine residue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg8 occurs in a ubiquitin-like conjugation reaction (18Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Recently, PE modification of Atg8 was shown to be linked to Atg8 function in membrane tethering and hemifusion during autophagosome formation (19Nakatogawa H. Ichimura Y. Ohsumi Y. Cell. 2007; 130: 165-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). At present, no information is available on the biosynthesis of EPG and its attachment to eEF1A, nor on its role in eEF1A function. Possible pathways for EPG synthesis include (i) the sequential addition of individual EPG components to the glutamate side chains of eEF1A, (ii) the pre-assembly of EPG, followed by its transfer to eEF1A, or (iii) the attachment of a larger structure containing the EPG moiety to eEF1A, followed by modification reactions on the protein. We favor this last possibility and hypothesize that eEF1A is modified with the phospholipid PE, followed by removal of the hydrophobic acyl or alkyl chains by appropriate enzymes. As a model system to address these questions, we chose T. brucei procyclic culture forms, because they readily take up tritiated Etn as a potential label for the EPG modification and because mutant cell lines can easily be generated to express tagged proteins, or down-regulate the expression of endogenous proteins using RNA interference (RNAi). In addition, as in most eukaryotic cells, the postulated substrate of the EPG modification, PE, represents a major phospholipid class in T. brucei (20Dixon H. Williamson J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1970; 33: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Patnaik P.K. Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. Yee M.C. Bütikofer P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells and yeast, PE biosynthesis has been studied in great detail (22Vance J.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 69-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Birner R. Daum G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 225: 273-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PE can be synthesized from Etn by phosphorylation to ethanolamine phosphate (Etn-P), which is subsequently activated to CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn), and transferred onto diradylglycerol to form PE. This reaction sequence involving a CDP-activated intermediate has originally been delineated by Kennedy and Weiss (24Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is commonly referred to as the Kennedy pathway. A similar reaction sequence involving a CDP-activated intermediate is also responsible for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (24Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The individual reactions for PE and PC synthesis by the Kennedy pathway have been localized to the cytosol (25Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PE can be generated by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS) or by head group exchange with PS. PS decarboxylation represents the major route for PE synthesis in mammalian cells and occurs in the Golgi and mitochondria (22Vance J.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 69-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Vance J.E. Steenbergen R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 27Choi J.Y. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In T. brucei, the pathways for the synthesis of PE, or other phospholipid classes, have not been studied in detail (28Vial H.J. Eldin P. Tielens A.G.M. van Hellemond J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5552-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on our hypothesis that PE may be the precursor of the EPG modification of eEF1A, we studied if blocking PE biosynthesis in T. brucei procyclic (insect) forms using RNAi against enzymes of the Kennedy pathway affects attachment of EPG to eEF1A. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were of analytical grade and were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland) or MP Biomedicals (Tägerig, Switzerland). [1-3H]Ethan-1-ol-2-amine hydrochloride ([3H]Etn, 60 Ci mmol-1) and [9,10(n)-3H]myristic acid ([3H]myristate, 60 Ci mmol-1) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). l-[3H(G)]Serine ([3H]serine, 29.5 Ci mmol-1) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. BioMax MS films were from GE Healthcare (Buckinghamshire, UK), and Kodak MBX films from Kodak SA (Lausanne, Switzerland). Trypanosomes and Culture Conditions—The T. brucei EP/GPEET procyclin null mutant Δprocyclin#1 (30Vassella E. Bütikofer P. Engstler M. Jelk J. Roditi I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the derived procyclic cell line expressing tagged eEF1A, were cultured at 27 °C in DTM supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). T. brucei 29-13 procyclic forms (31Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) (obtained from Paul Englund, John Hopkins University School of Medicine) were cultured at 27 °C in SDM-79 containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 μg/ml hygromycin, and 15 μg/ml G418 to maintain constitutive expression of the T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor. Derived RNAi strains, including the RNAi strain against T. brucei eEF1A (8Bouzaidi-Tiali N. Aeby E. Charriere F. Pusnik M. Schneider A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4302-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of André Schneider, University of Fribourg), were cultured in the presence of an additional 2 μg/ml puromycin. The expression of double-stranded RNA was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. T. brucei 427 bloodstream forms were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in HMI-9 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Differentiation of bloodstream forms to procyclic forms was induced by the addition of 6 mm cis-aconitate and transferring the cells to 27 °C in SDM-79 containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (32Bütikofer P. Vassella E. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Civenni M. Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Mookherjee N. Pearson T.W. Roditi I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was blocked in Δprocyclin#1 parasites by the addition of cycloheximide (50 μg/ml, final concentration) to the culture medium 30 min before the start of the experiment. Protein synthesis was measured by incorporation of [3H]serine into protein. Construction of Epitope-tagged T. brucei eEF1A—To express a hemagglutinin-tagged variant of eEF1A (HA-eEF1A), the annotated T. brucei eEF1A (TEF1) gene (GeneDB accession number Tb10.70.5670) was amplified by PCR with flanking HindIII and BamHI restriction sites (primers TbEF1A, supplemental Table S1), cloned into the TOP10F′ vector with a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen), and subsequently subcloned between HindIII and BamHI restriction sites into the pCorleone vector (a kind gift of Isabel Roditi, University of Bern) (33Ruepp S. Furger A. Kurath U. Kunz Renggli C. Hemphill A. Brun R. Roditi I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The vector was linearized with HindIII, and an oligonucleotide coding for the HA tag and flanked by two HindIII sites (primers HA, supplemental Table S1) was cloned into the same vector at the N terminus of the T. brucei eEF1A gene. Before transfection into Δprocyclin#1, the vector (pAShaEF) was linearized with NotI and SalI. RNAi-mediated Gene Silencing—Putative T. brucei ethanolamine kinase (GeneDB accession number Tb11.18.0017) and putative T. brucei ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (Tb11.01.5730) were down-regulated by RNAi-mediated gene silencing using stem loop constructs containing a puromycin resistance gene. Cloning the gene fragments into the vector pALC14 (a kind gift of André Schneider, University of Fribourg) was performed as described previously (34Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), using PCR products obtained with primers Tb0017 (spanning nucleotides 261–810 of Tb11.18.0017) and Tb5730 (spanning nucleotides 51–585 of Tb11.01.5730) (supplemental Table S1), resulting in plasmids pAS0017 and pAS5730, respectively. For transfection of T. brucei procyclic forms, the vectors were linearized with NotI. Stable Transfection of Trypanosomes—T. brucei procyclic forms were transfected with pAS0017, pAS5730, or pAShaEF and selected for antibiotic resistance by addition of 10 μg/ml blasticidin S HCl (Invitrogen) for Δprocyclin#1 cells or 2 μg/ml puromycin for 29-13 RNAi cells to the culture medium. Clones were obtained by limiting dilution. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA for Northern blotting was prepared by the standard acidic guanidium isothiocyanate method (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 32P-labeled probes were made by random priming of the same PCR products used as inserts in the stem-loop vector (Prime-a-Gene Labeling System, Promega, Madison, WI). Hybridization was performed overnight at 60 °C, and the membrane was analyzed by autoradiography using BioMax MS film and a TransScreen-HE intensifying screen (Kodak). Ribosomal RNA was visualized on the same gel by ethidium bromide staining to control for equal loading. Metabolic Labeling and Extractions—Trypanosomes were labeled with [3H]Etn or [3H]myristate for 2–20 h (36Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and sequentially extracted with 2 × 10 ml of chloroform:methanol (CM, 2:1, by volume) to extract bulk phospholipids, followed by 3 × 5 ml chloroform:methanol:water (CMW, 10:10:3, by volume) to solubilize GPI precursors and free GPIs (30Vassella E. Bütikofer P. Engstler M. Jelk J. Roditi I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Field, M. C., and Menon, A. K. (1992) in Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach (Hooper, N. M., and Turner, A. J., eds) pp. 155-190, IRL Press, OxfordGoogle Scholar). The resulting pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS. CMW fractions were pooled, dried under nitrogen, and partitioned between butan-1-ol (CMWbut) and water (CMWaqu) (37Field, M. C., and Menon, A. K. (1992) in Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach (Hooper, N. M., and Turner, A. J., eds) pp. 155-190, IRL Press, OxfordGoogle Scholar). In some experiments, CMWbut extracts were treated with purified GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-phospholipase D) from bovine serum as described before (38Bütikofer P. Boschung M. Brodbeck U. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15533-15541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). [3H]Etn-labeled acid-soluble metabolites were extracted from trypanosomes as described elsewhere (39Rifkin M.R. Strobos C.A.M. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TLC—One-dimensional TLC was performed on Silica Gel 60 plates. To separate phospholipids, CM extracts were run in solvent system 1, composed of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid: water (25:15: 4:2, by volume). For separation of GPI precursors, CMWbut phases were run in solvent system 2, composed of chloroform:methanol:water (4:4:1, by volume). Ethanolamine metabolites were separated in solvent system 3, composed of 25% ammonium hydroxide:methanol:0.6% NaCl in water (1:10: 10, by volume). Radioactivity was detected by scanning the airdried plate with a radioisotope detector (Berthold Technologies, Regensdorf, Switzerland) and quantified using the Rita Star® software provided by the manufacturer. Alternatively, the plate was sprayed with En3hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to MXB film at -70 °C. On all TLC plates, appropriate lipid standards were run alongside the samples. Lipid Phosphorous Determination—Phospholipid fractions were scraped from TLC plates and digested by boiling in perchloric acid, and the released inorganic phosphate was reacted with ammonium molybdate and quantified photometrically (40Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). Each determination was accompanied by a series of inorganic phosphate standards. The assay was linear between 0 and 200 nmol of phosphate per tube. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Extracted proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For detection of 3H-labeled proteins, gels were fixed, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, soaked in Amplify (GE Healthcare), dried, and exposed to MBX films at -70 °C. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semi-dry blotting. Mouse monoclonal antibody against eEF1A (α-EF, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Mouse monoclonal antibody against HA (α-HA, Covance, Berkeley, CA) was used at a dilution of 1:3000. Mouse monoclonal antibody against EP procyclin (α-EP), generously provided by Terry W. Pearson (University of Victoria), was used at a dilution of 1:2500. Primary antibodies were detected with secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Baar, Switzerland) at a dilution of 1:5000 and using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—HA-eEF1A from trypanosomes lyzed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 was immunoprecipitated with Anti-HA Affinity Matrix (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions and boiled in sample loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. Mass Spectrometry—Immunoprecipitated HA-eEF1A was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel reductive alkylation and trypsin digestion. Identification of peptide masses was done at the FingerPrints Proteomics Facility, Wellcome Trust Biocenter, University of Dundee (Dundee, Scotland), using an ABI 4700 matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-Tof/Tof) mass spectrometer. The tryptic peptides were further analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) using a Dionex Ultimate LC, equipped with a Pepmap C18 column (75 μm × 15 cm), coupled to an ABI Q-Trap 4000 mass spectrometer. The peptide-resolving part of the nano-LC gradient was from 1% to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 20 min at 300 nl/min. Chemical Treatment of eEF1A—Immunoprecipitated [3H]Etn-labeled HA-eEF1A was incubated in 50 μl of 70% formic acid at 37 °C for 4 or 22 h. The reaction was stopped by diluting the sample with 150 μl of water. After drying in a SpeedVac, peptides were resuspended in sample loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting or fluorography. Alternatively, SpeedVac-dried SDS fractions of [3H]Etn-labeled Δprocyclin#1 parasites were incubated with 50 μl of 70% formic acid at 37 °C for 4 or 22 h, diluted with 150 μl of water, and analyzed as above. T. brucei eEF1A Is Labeled with [3H]Etn—Alignment of the deduced protein sequence of T. brucei eEF1A with carrot and mouse eEF1A shows 76% identity with both sequences (Fig. 2). In particular, the two glutamate residues shown to be modified with EPG in plant, Glu289 and Glu362 (11Ransom W.D. Lao P.-C. Gage D.A. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and mammalian eEF1A, Glu301 and Glu374 (9Rosenberry T.L. Krall J.A. Dever T.E. Haas R. Louvard D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7096-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Whiteheart S.W. Shenbagamurthi P. Chen L. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14334-14341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are conserved in T. brucei eEF1A (Glu289 and Glu362). The original identification of EPG bound to eEFA1 in mammalian cells was prompted by the observation that eEF1A was labeled with [3H]Etn (9Rosenberry T.L. Krall J.A. Dever T.E. Haas R. Louvard D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7096-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Whiteheart S.W. Shenbagamurthi P. Chen L. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14334-14341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used the same approach in T. brucei and found that incubation of procyclic forms lacking the genes for procyclins (Δprocyclin#1) with [3H]Etn resulted in labeling of a single strong band at 49 kDa (Fig. 3A, left panel). The reason to use this particular mutant cell line was to avoid possible misidentification of labeled bands with the multiple forms of procyclins, which readily incorporate large amounts of [3H]Etn into their GPI anchors (36Bütikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2731-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that a band of similar molecular mass is also recognized by a monoclonal antibody against eEF1A (Fig. 3A, right panel). The band at 37 kDa likely represents a degradation product of eEF1A. Further evidence that the 49-kDa labeled protein is eEF1A was obtained from experiments using a T. brucei 29-13 procyclic cell line expressing an RNAi construct designed to knock down the expression of eEF1A (8Bouzaidi-Tiali N. Aeby E. Charriere F. Pusnik M. Schneider A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4302-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results show that, after induction of RNAi by the addition of tetracycline to the culture medium, the 49-kDa band is no longer labeled with [3H]Etn; in contrast, incorporation of label into GPI-anchored EP procyclin, which migrates as a broad band at ∼42 kDa, continued (Fig. 3B, left panel). Immunoblotting revealed that induction of RNAi against eEF1A resulted in complete disappearance of the 49- and 37-kDa bands that are recognized by eEF1A antibody in control cells (Fig. 3B, right panel). In addition, we found that when protein synthesis, as measured by incorporation of [3H]serine into total protein, is inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide to the culture medium (Fig. 3C, left panel), incorporation of label into eEF1A is blocked, indicating that the attachment of Etn to eEF1A occurs during, or shortly after, protein synthesis (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the 49-kDa [3H]Etn-labeled band was also seen in T. brucei 427 bloodstream forms and during differentiation of bloodstream to procyclic forms in culture (Fig. 3D). The additional 3H-labeled band at 55 kDa in T. brucei 427 bloodstream forms represents the variant surface glycoprotein, which is replaced during differentiation to procyclic forms by the EP/GPEET procyclins (43Roditi I. Liniger M. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Together, these results strongly indicate that the 49-kDa [3H]Etn-labeled band in T. brucei procyclic and bloodstream forms represents eEF1A.FIGURE 3Ethanolamine incorporation into T. brucei eEF1A. A, after incubation of the procyclic T. brucei strain Δprocyclin#1 with 2.5 μCi/ml [3H]Etn for 18 h, trypanosomes were washed to remove unincorporated label, delipidated with organic solvents, and sequentially extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins in the SDS extract were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (left panel, 1 × 108 cell equivalents) or immunoblotting using α-EF antibody (right panel, 2 × 105 cell equivalents). B, endogenous eEF1A in T. brucei 29-13 procyclic forms was down-regulated using RNAi by incubating the cells in the absence (-) or presence (+) of tetracycline (Tet). After 8 h of induction, 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]Etn was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 16 h. SDS extracts were prepared and analyzed as in A. The lanes contain 2 × 108 and 5 × 106 cell equivalents for fluorography (left panel) and immunoblotting (right panel), respectively. C, T. brucei Δprocyclin#1 cells were incubated in the absence (-) or presence (+) of cycloheximide (CHX, 50 μg/ml final concentration) for 30 min to inhibit protein synthesis. Sub"

In addition, the structures presented here define requirements for the design of artificial EGF-sequestering proteins that would be valuable anticancer therapeutics. Drosophila Argos is an antagonist of EGF receptor signalling that functions by binding and sequestering EGFR ligands. The structure of Argos bound to the EGFR ligand Spitz reveals that Argos engulfs the ligand using three related domains with structural resemblance to receptors for TGF-β and urokinase plasminogen activator. Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or ErbB/HER family and their activating ligands are essential regulators of diverse developmental processes1,2. Inappropriate activation of these receptors is a key feature of many human cancers3, and its reversal is an important clinical goal. A natural secreted antagonist of EGFR signalling, called Argos, was identified in Drosophila4. We showed previously that Argos functions by directly binding (and sequestering) growth factor ligands that activate EGFR5. Here we describe the 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of Argos bound to an EGFR ligand. Contrary to expectations4,6, Argos contains no EGF-like domain. Instead, a trio of closely related domains (resembling a three-finger toxin fold7) form a clamp-like structure around the bound EGF ligand. Although structurally unrelated to the receptor, Argos mimics EGFR by using a bipartite binding surface to entrap EGF. The individual Argos domains share unexpected structural similarities with the extracellular ligand-binding regions of transforming growth factor-β family receptors8. The three-domain clamp of Argos also resembles the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor, which uses a similar mechanism to engulf the EGF-like module of uPA9. Our results indicate that undiscovered mammalian counterparts of Argos may exist among other poorly characterized structural homologues. In addition, the structures presented here define requirements for the design of artificial EGF-sequestering proteins that would be valuable anti-cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2097778420,"The reduced folate carrier (RFC), a bidirectional anion transporter, is the major uptake route of reduced folates essential for a spectrum of biochemical reactions and thus cellular proliferation. However, here we show that ectopic overexpression of the RFC, but not of folate receptor alpha, a high affinity unidirectional folate uptake route serving here as a negative control, resulted in an approximately 15-fold decline in cellular viability in medium lacking folates but not in folate-containing medium. Moreover to explore possible mechanisms of adaptation to folate deficiency in various cell lines that express the endogenous RFC, we first determined the gene expression status of the following genes: (a) RFC, (b) ATP-driven folate exporters (i.e. MRP1, MRP5, and breast cancer resistance protein), and (c) folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase and gamma-glutamate hydrolase (GGH), enzymes catalyzing folate polyglutamylation and hydrolysis, respectively. Upon 3-7 days of folate deprivation, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed a specific approximately 2.5-fold decrease in RFC mRNA levels in both breast cancer and T-cell leukemia cell lines that was accompanied by a consistent fall in methotrexate influx, serving here as an RFC transport activity assay. Likewise a 2.4-fold decrease in GGH mRNA levels and approximately 19% decreased GGH activity was documented for folate-deprived breast cancer cells. These results along with those of a novel mathematical biomodeling devised here suggest that upon severe short term (i.e. up to 7 days) folate deprivation RFC transport activity becomes detrimental as RFC, but not ATP-driven folate exporters, efficiently extrudes folate monoglutamates out of cells. Hence down-regulation of RFC and GGH may serve as a novel adaptive response to severe folate deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2080151197,"The Rho GTPases are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are required for cell adhesion, migration, and polarity. Among the key Rho regulatory proteins in the context of cell migration are the p190 RhoGAPs (p190A and p190B), which function to modulate Rho signaling in response to integrin engagement. The p190 RhoGAPs undergo complex regulation, including phosphorylation by several identified kinases, interactions with phospholipids, and association with a variety of cellular proteins. Here, we have identified an additional regulatory mechanism unique to p190A RhoGAP that involves priming-dependent phosphorylation by glycogen synthase-3-beta (GSK-3beta), a kinase previously implicated in establishing cell polarity. We found that p190A-deficient fibroblasts exhibit a defect in directional cell migration reflecting a requirement for GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation of amino acids in the C-terminal ""tail"" of p190A. This phosphorylation leads to inhibition of p190A RhoGAP activity in vitro and in vivo. These studies identify p190A as a novel GSK-3beta substrate and reveal a mechanism by which GSK-3beta contributes to cellular polarization in directionally migrating cells via effects on Rho GTPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2138928151,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans bind to and regulate many inflammatory mediators in vitro, suggesting that they serve an important role in influencing inflammatory responses in vivo. Here we evaluated the role of syndecan-1, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in modulating inflammatory responses in Gram-positive toxic shock, a systemic disease that is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Syndecan-1-null and wild-type mice were injected intraperitoneally with staphylococcal enterotoxin B, a pyrogenic superantigen, and their inflammatory responses were assessed. Syndecan-1-null mice showed significantly increased liver injury, vascular permeability, and death in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B challenge compared with wild-type mice. Although serum levels of systemic IL-2 and IFNgamma were similar between the two backgrounds, those of TNFalpha and IL-6 were significantly increased in syndecan-1-null mice undergoing Gram-positive toxic shock. Furthermore, syndecan-1-null mice challenged with staphylococcal enterotoxin B showed enhanced T cell accumulation in tissues, whereas immunodepletion of T cells protected syndecan-1-null mice from the magnified systemic cytokine storm, inflammatory tissue injury, and death. Importantly, syndecan-1 shedding was induced in wild-type mice injected with staphylococcal enterotoxin B, and the administration of heparan sulfate, but not syndecan-1 core protein, rescued syndecan-1-null mice from lethal toxic shock by suppressing the production of TNFalpha and IL-6, and attenuating inflammatory tissue injury. Altogether, these data suggest that syndecan-1 shedding is a key endogenous mechanism that protects the host from Gram-positive toxic shock by inhibiting the dysregulation and amplification of the inflammatory response."

Although its product is the e-subunit of translation initiation factor eIF3, other evidence indicates that it interacts with proteasomes or other proteins to regulate protein stability. Here we report that the fission yeast int6+ is required for overcoming stress imposed by histidine starvation, using the drug 3-aminotriazole (3AT). Microarray and complementary Northern studies using wild-type, int6Δ or gcn2Δ mutants indicate that 3AT-treated wild-type yeast induces core environmental stress response (CESR) genes in addition to typical general amino acid control (GAAC) genes whose transcription depends on the eIF2 kinase, Gcn2. In agreement with this, Sty1 MAPK and its target transcription factor Atf1, which signal the CESR, are required for overcoming 3AT-induced starvation. We find that Int6 is required for maintaining the basal level of Atf1 and for rapid transcriptional activation of the CESR on 3AT-insult. Pulse labeling experiments indicate that int6Δ significantly slows down de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, Atf1 protein half-life was reduced in int6Δ cells. These effects would account for the compromised Atf1 activity on 3AT-induced stress.

Mouse mammary tumor virus integrates into the mouse genome, altering proteins or their expression and thereby eliciting mammary tumors. The sites of mouse mammary tumor virus integration were identified to delineate the molecular basis of the mammary tumorigenesis (see Refs. 1Li Y. Hively W.P. Varmus H.E.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3373-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Curiously, eIF3 isolated from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not contain the homologue of Int-6/eIF3e (6Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol.

Yet, eIF3 isolated from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe includes its homologue Int6 (also known as Yin6) (8Akiyoshi Y. Clayton J. Phan L. Yamamoto M. Hinnebusch A.G. Watanabe Y. Asano K.

To investigate the biological function of Int6 in gene regulation, we have utilized cDNA microarray analysis and biochemical and genetic tools available in fission yeast S. pombe. In this report, we focus on stress response induced by amino acid starvation. In mammalian cells and the budding yeast S. cerevisiae subjected to amino acid depletion, phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 at Ser-51 by an eIF2 kinase (eIF2K) termed GCN2 alters this translation factor, resulting in a block in global translation (for review, see Ref. 13Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Coincident with reduced protein synthesis, eIF2 phosphorylation promotes preferential translation of key transcription factors by a mechanism involving alternative ribosomal re-initiation at short upstream open reading frame elements located in the 5′-leader of mRNAs. Accordingly, GCN2 activation induces translation of distinct basic leucine zipper (bZIP)-type transcription factors, mammalian ATF4, and S. cerevisiae Gcn4p, respectively, for directing stress responsive genes involved in amino acid metabolism and nutrient salvaging (the general amino acid control or GAAC response). In mammals, four eIF2Ks, including GCN2, HRI, PKR, and PERK/PEK, function to regulate translation in response to different stress arrangements (14Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). S. pombe encodes only GCN2 and HRI orthologues, Gcn2 and Hri1/Hri2, that are activated by amino acid starvation and oxidative stress, respectively (15Zhan K. Narasimhan J. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2004; 168: 1867-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Zhan K. Vattem K.M. Bauer B.N. Dever T.E. Chen J.-J. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7134-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that histidine starvation caused by the drug 3-aminotriazole (3AT) induces Sty1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent signaling pathway in S. pombe, in addition to the GAAC response as typically induced in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, we show that Int6 stimulates the Sty1-dependent response by enhancing Atf1 expression in response to histidine starvation. The Sty1 MAPK (also known as Spc1 and Phh1) transduces the stress-activated signaling pathway in response to a number of conditions including oxidative stress, osmotic stress, and DNA damaging conditions (17Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bähler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Sty1 activation is best studied in the H2O2-induced oxidative stress response, which involves two different pathways. In the first pathway, three related membrane-spanning histidine kinases, Mak1, Mak2, and Mak3, are believed to directly sense the stress condition, transducing the signal to the Wis4 and Win1 MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKK), the Wis1 MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and then to Sty1 MAPK (19Ikner A. Shiozaki K. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, the oxidized cysteine of Sty1 makes a direct disulfide linkage with a cysteine residue of Tpx1, the sole 2-Cys peroxiredoxin; this interaction is additionally required for full Sty1 activation (20Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan M.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The active Sty1 then moves to the nucleus, and phosphorylates Atf1 therein (17Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), resulting in increased Atf1 stability and transcriptional activity (21Lawrence C.L. Maekawa H. Worthington J.L. Reiter W. Wilkinson C.R.M. Jones N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5160-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Activated Sty1 is also recruited to the chromosomes, in a manner dependent on Atf1 but independent of its phosphorylation status (22Reiter W. Watt S. Dawson K. Lawrence C.L. Bähler J. Jones N. Wilkinson C.R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 283: 9945-9956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Together, Sty1-mediated signaling induces transcription of Atf1-dependent genes, termed the core environmental stress response (CESR) (18Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bähler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Yet, in the presence of H2O2, the peroxidase activity of Tpx1 catalyzes a disulfide linkage formation within a second bZIP transcription factor Pap1, activating transcription of an overlapping but distinct set of genes compared with the CESR (23Bozonet S. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Cameron J. Veal E.A. Morgan B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23319-23327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is proposed that a high dose of H2O2 activates Sty1 and hence Atf1, whereas a low dose of H2O2 activates Pap1, but not Sty1 or Atf1 (24Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this way, fission yeast can express similar but distinct transcriptional profiles appropriate for the level of H2O2 exposure. By studying the genome-wide effect of Int6 on the 3AT-induced starvation response, we not only link the Sty1 MAPK pathway to the metabolic stress that is well characterized in S. cerevisiae, but also suggest that the robust translation initiation promoted by intact eIF3 is one of the requisites for sound MAPK-depending signaling governed by the activity of the Atf1 transcription factor. Thus, the present study provides an important insight into the mechanism of gene regulation changes caused by the compromised activity of Int6/eIF3e-directed translation.

Narasimhan J. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2004; 168: 1867-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). KAY329, KAY415, and KAY609 were constructed by transformation of KAY296, KAY406, and WY459 (15Zhan K. Narasimhan J. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2004; 168: 1867-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), respectively, with the int6::kanMX module, as described (8Akiyoshi Y. Clayton J. Phan L. Yamamoto M. Hinnebusch A.G. Watanabe Y. Asano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10056-10062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To construct KAY665, SP223 was transformed with the pap1::ura4+ disruption construct that was amplified by PCR using oligos 5′-CATTGCTTTGTGAATTACATT-3′ and 5′-CGATGAGGGGTTGTCTTTGT-3′ and DNA of TP108-03 (h- leu1 ura4 pap1Δ::ura4+, a gift of C. Shimoda) as template, and then the leu1–32 locus was converted into leu1+ using pJK148, as described above. KAY456, KAY508, KAY464, KAY484, KAY584, KAY569, and KAY606 were all derived from isogenic strains JY878 (h90 ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18), JX303 (h90 ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18 atf1Δ::ura4+), and JX25 (h90 ade6-M216 leu1–32 ura4-D18 pcr1Δ::ura4+), hence isogenic to each other. The three parental strains are kind gifts from M. Yamamoto. KAY456 was constructed by converting the leu1–32 and ura4-D18 loci of JY878 into leu1+ and ura4+, respectively, as described above. KAY508 was prepared by introducing int6Δ::kanMX into KAY456, as described above. Strains KAY464 and KAY484 were constructed by converting the leu1–32 locus of JX303 and JX25, respectively, into leu1+, as described above. KAY569 was constructed by transforming KAY464 with the int6Δ::kanMX module DNA. To create KAY584, we first constructed KAY485 (h90 ade6-M210 leu1–32::leu1+ 〈pJK148〉 ura4-D18 pcr1Δ::ura4+) by converting the leu1–32 locus of JX26 (h90 ade6-M210 leu1–32 ura4-D18 pcr1Δ::ura4+; isogenic to JX25 and a gift of M. Yamamoto) into leu1+ using pJK148, as described above. Then a diploid strain from crossing KAY485 and KAY464 was allowed to sporulate, producing haploid progenies. A clone, later named KAY584, had the desired genotype with pcr1Δ and atf1Δ markers, which were confirmed by PCR. To create KAY606, initial attempts to introduce int6Δ::kanMX into KAY484 by transformation were unsuccessful. Thus a diploid strain from the cross of KAY508 and KAY485 was allowed to sporulate and a haploid strain with the desired genotypes was selected and named KAY606. KAY672 is a haploid progeny from a cross between KAY465 (h90 ade6-M210 leu1–32 ura4-D18 atf1Δ::ura4+) and KAY665. KAY641, KAY647, KAY640, and KAY645 were all derived from isogenic strains PR109 (h- leu1–32 ura4-D18) and MR1366 (h- leu1–32 ura4-D18 spc1::ura4+) (26Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), kindly provided by P. Russell. KAY641 was prepared by converting the leu1–32 and ura4-D18 loci of PR109, as described above. Then KAY647 was created by introducing int6Δ::kanMX as described above. KAY640 was prepared by converting MR1366 to leu+ as described above. Then KAY645 was made by introducing int6Δ::kanMX into KAY640, as described above. KAY655 was a haploid progeny from a cross between a sty1-His6HA strain and a leu1+ wild-type strain. The int6+ gene of KAY655 was deleted as mentioned above to generate KAY658. Yeast Media and Growth Conditions—Cells were grown at 30 °C in YES media containing 225 mg/liter of adenine, leucine, histidine, lysine, and uracil or EMM media containing the appropriate auxotrophic requirements. For amino acid starvation, EMM media were supplemented with 100 mg/liters of para-amino benzoic acid and inositol, 225 mg/liter of all 20 amino acids lacking histidine and leucine, adenine, and uracil, and 1125 mg/liter of leucine (EMM-C), with or without 10 mm 3AT. Microarray Analysis—Yeast strains were cultured in liquid EMM-C at 30 °C at an early exponential growth, and treated with 30 mm 3AT. To avoid perturbation from stress response induced by higher cell density, 4S. Watt and J. Bahler, unpublished data. we maintained the culture density at A600 ≤ 0.5 by diluting the culture when harvesting cells at 1-h post 3AT treatment if necessary. 50 ml of cells were harvested before or 1 and 3 h after the 3AT treatment and then total RNA was isolated using a hot-phenol protocol (27Lyne R. Burns G. Mata J. Penkett C.J. Rustici G. Chen D. Langford C. Vetrie D. Bähler J. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We used DNA microarrays carrying all known and predicted S. pombe genes. 20 μg of total RNA was labeled by either Cy3-dCTP (reference RNA: wild-type time 0 RNA) or Cy5-dCTP (sample RNAs). Hybridization and initial data analysis were performed as previously described (27Lyne R. Burns G. Mata J. Penkett C.J. Rustici G. Chen D. Langford C. Vetrie D. Bähler J. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The normalized data were analyzed with GeneSpring software (Agilent). Data will be submitted to ArrayExpress. All processed data are available online. Northern Blotting—30 μg of total RNAs, which were extracted as described above, were separated by MOPS-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-XL membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by conventional capillary blotting, and fixed on the membrane with UV. Probes were prepared by PCR from genomic DNA using the gene-specific primers, listed in Table 2, with radiolabeled nucleotide. The RNAs transferred to the membrane were hybridized with the probe at 65 °C for 20 h. The membrane was then washed, exposed to imaging plate for an appropriate time, and analyzed by Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System (Packard).TABLE 2List of oligodeoxynucleotides used to prepare radiolabeled probes for Northern blotting in this study The following primers were designed by the Bähler group in their microarray studies (27Lyne R.

Resuspended cells were lysed by vortex with 0.5-mm glass beads in 4 cycles of 30-s spin and 30-s cooling. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C and employed as WCE. The protein concentration of the WCE was determined using the Protein assay kit I (Bio-Rad). WCEs were resolved by 8 or 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting. The immobilized samples were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween containing 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by immunoblotting using the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). Pulse Labeling Experiments—Yeast were grown to A600 ∼ 1 in 50 ml of EMM + adenine with a constant aeration at 30 °C and then supplemented with 30 mm 3AT. At appropriate times, 5 ml of the culture was transferred to a 50-ml conical tube, to which 300 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1175 Ci/mmol) was added. After 20 min, 1 mm non-radiolabeled methionine was added to the culture, and cells were harvested immediately for WCE preparation as described under “Immunoblotting.” WCE samples containing 10 μg of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining. The dried gel was analyzed with the STORM PhosphorImager. Gcn2 and Int6 Are Required for Histidine Starvation Response Induced by 3AT—Previous studies by others implicated eIF3i/Sum1 and eIF3e/Int6 in stress-activated signaling by pathways not yet identified (28Humphrey T. Enoch T. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Crane R. Craig R. Murray R. Dunand-Sauthier I. Humphrey T. Norbury C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3993-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, translational control induced by amino acid starvation has been well characterized using yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system. Thus, we studied the effect of int6+ deletion (int6Δ) on the amino acid starvation response in fission yeast. A specific measure of the activity of S. cerevisiae Gcn2p eIF2 kinase and its Gcn2-dependent GAAC response is resistance to growth on 3AT. 3AT is a competitive inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis, and loss of GCN2 prevents induced expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes required for growth in the presence of this drug. To test if Int6 is required for the histidine starvation response, we examined 3AT sensitivity of the int6Δ mutant in leu+ backgrounds. The plate assay showed that the int6 deletion confers sensitivity of S. pombe to 3AT (Fig. 1A, middle panel, row 2), a phenotype analogous to the Gcn- (general control non-derepressible) phenotype in S. cerevisiae. We also confirmed that the deletion of gcn2 (Fig. 1A, middle panel, row 3), but not of the other S. pombe eIF2K genes hri1 or hri2 (rows 4 and 5), conferred 3AT sensitivity (15Zhan K. Narasimhan J. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2004; 168: 1867-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Combining gcn2Δ with hri1Δ hri2Δ did not enhance 3AT sensitivity compared with gcn2Δ alone (rows 3 and 6), indicating that among the three eIF2Ks Gcn2 is solely responsible for the starvation response. In S. cerevisiae, the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 promotes different gene transcription programs, including the GAAC (30Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Goulb T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Deletion of its S. pombe orthologue gcn5 (31Yamada T. Mizuno K.-I. Hirota K. Kon N. Wahls W.P. Hertsuiker E. Murofushi H. Shibata T. Ohta K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1792-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) resulted in 3AT sensitivity (Fig. 1A, middle panel, rows 10 and 11). These results implicate Int6, Gcn2, and Gcn5 in the histidine starvation response. 3AT sensitivity displayed by the mutants was relaxed by addition of histidine in the medium (Fig. 1A, right panel), confirming that 3AT imposes histidine starvation to mutant yeasts. Genome-wide Expression Profiles of Fission Yeast in Response to 3AT-induced Histidine Starvation—Next, we wished to address the relationship between Int6/eIF3e and the components of the Gcn2 eIF2K pathway. As shown in Fig. 1A, combining int6Δ with gcn2Δ or hri1Δ hri2Δ marginally increased 3AT sensitivity of the parental int6Δ strain (middle panel, rows 2–3 and 7–9), suggesting that Int6 and eIF2Ks are involved in parallel pathways. However, the phenotypic difference is minor and its interpretation awaited further examination such as gene transcription profiling. Accordingly, we performed transcriptional profiling using cDNA microarray to compare mRNA levels among wild-type, int6Δ, gcn2Δ, and triple eIF2K knock-out strains. These strains were cultured to an early log phase and then 30 mm 3AT was added to elicit histidine starvation. To determine the time of 3AT treatment for microarray experiments, we first examined the timing of eIF2 phosphorylation in response to 3AT-induced stress. As shown in Fig. 1B, eIF2 was phosphorylated in wild-type cells within 1 h after the addition of 30 mm 3AT, and a high level of phosphorylated eIF2 was sustained for an additional period of 2 h (lanes 1–5). This phosphorylation was almost eliminated by gcn2Δ (lanes 11–15), although a modest amount of eIF2 phosphorylation was detected in the Gcn2-deficient cells at 1 h, which was dependent on Hri1 or Hri2 (compare lanes 13 and 18). Likewise, the addition of 1 mm histidine to the 3AT medium eliminated eIF2 phosphorylation for the initial period of 3 h (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 2–3 versus 5–6). These results together suggest that histidine starvation resulted in Gcn2 activation. Following 5 h of 3AT treatment, we did detect eIF2 phosphorylation even with the addition of histidine (Fig. 1C, lane 7). This suggests that, in S. pombe, longer periods of exposure to 3AT can trigger stress arrangements th"
https://openalex.org/W2059901328,"Maltose metabolism during the conversion of transitory (leaf) starch to sucrose requires a 4-alpha-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) in the cytosol of leaf cells. This enzyme is called DPE2 because of its similarity to the disproportionating enzyme in plastids (DPE1). DPE1 does not use maltose; it primarily transfers a maltosyl unit from one maltotriose to a second maltotriose to make glucose and maltopentaose. DPE2 is a modular protein consisting of a family 77 glycosyl hydrolase domain, similar to DPE1, but unlike DPE1 the domain is interrupted by an insertion of approximately 150 amino acids as well as an N-terminal extension that consists of two carbohydrate binding modules. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the DPE2-type enzyme is present in a limited but highly diverse group of organisms. Here we show that DPE2 transfers the non-reducing glucosyl unit from maltose to glycogen by a ping-pong mechanism. The forward reaction (consumption of maltose) is specific for the beta-anomer of maltose, while the reverse reaction (production of maltose) is not stereospecific for the acceptor glucose. Additionally, through deletion mutants we show that the glycosyl hydrolase domain alone provides disproportionating activity with a much higher affinity for short maltodextrins than the complete wild-type enzyme, while absence of the carbohydrate binding modules completely abolishes activity with large complex carbohydrates, reflecting the presumed function of DPE2 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2042092300,"Protein Z (PZ) is a multidomain vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that functions as a cofactor to promote the inactivation of factor Xa (fXa) by PZ-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) by three orders of magnitude. To understand the mechanism by which PZ improves the reactivity of fXa with ZPI, we expressed wild-type PZ, PZ lacking the γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain (GD-PZ), and a chimeric PZ mutant in which both Gla and EGF-like domains of the molecule were substituted with identical domains of fXa. The ZPI binding and the cofactor function of the PZ derivatives were characterized in both binding and kinetic assays. The binding assay indicated that all PZ derivatives interact with ZPI with a similar dissociation constant (KD) of ∼7 nm. However, the apparent KD for the chimeric PZ-mediated ZPI inhibition of fXa was elevated 6-fold on PC/PS vesicles and its capacity to function as a cofactor to accelerate the ZPI inhibition of fXa was also decreased 6-fold. The cofactor activity of GD-PZ was dramatically impaired; however, the deletion mutant exhibited a normal cofactor function in solution. A chimeric activated protein C mutant containing the Gla domain of fXa was susceptible to inhibition by ZPI in the presence of PZ. These results suggest that: (i) the ZPI interactive site of PZ is located within the C-terminal domain of the cofactor and (ii) a specific interaction between the Gla domains of PZ and fXa contributes ∼6-fold to the acceleration of the ZPI inhibition of fXa on phospholipid membranes.

Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, PZ has an N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain that is followed by two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (light chain homologue) and a C-terminal pseudo catalytic domain (heavy chain homologue) (1Ichinose A. Takeya H. Espling E. Iwanaga S. Kisiel W. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Sejima H. Hayashi T. Deyashiki Y. Nishioka J. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Unlike fXa and other vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteases, two of the catalytic triad residues of the C-terminal domain have not been conserved in the homologous regions of PZ (1Ichinose A. Takeya H. Espling E. Iwanaga S. Kisiel W. Davie E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Sejima H. Hayashi T. Deyashiki Y. Nishioka J. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, PZ has no catalytic function, but instead it binds to PZ-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) with a high affinity, thereby promoting the ZPI inhibition of fXa in the presence of PC/PS vesicles and Ca2+ by approximately three orders of magnitude (3Broze Jr., G.J. Miletich J.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 73: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). ZPI is a 72-kDa serpin with a plasma concentration of 2.6–2.9 μg/ml that appears to interact with the active site pocket of fXa by a covalent mechanism similar to that observed with antithrombin and most other inhibitory serpins (4Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, unlike antithrombin, which can inhibit all coagulation proteases, ZPI is a specific inhibitor of fXa and factor XIa (4Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tabatabai A. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Thromb. Haemostas. 2001; 85: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Rezaie A.R. Sun M.F. Gailani D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9427-9433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), though recent results have indicated that it may also inhibit factor IXa (9Heeb M.J. Cabral K.M. Ruan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33819-33825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ZPI may play a critical role in the regulation of the coagulation cascade because its deficiency is associated with venous thromboembolic diseases (10Water N. Tan T. Ashton F. O'Grady A. Day T. Browett P. Ockelford P. Harper P. Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 129: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 11Kemkes-Matthes B. Nees M. Kuhnel G. Matzdorff A. Matthes K.J. Thromb. Res. 2002; 106: 183-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ZPI by itself is a poor inhibitor of fXa, unless it forms a complex with PZ on membrane phospholipids in the presence of Ca2+ (4Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the inactivation of factor XIa by ZPI is independent of a cofactor (7Tabatabai A. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Thromb. Haemostas. 2001; 85: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Rezaie A.R. Sun M.F. Gailani D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9427-9433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PZ functions as a cofactor to accelerate the reactivity of fXa with ZPI on negatively charged membrane surfaces is not known nor is the PZ domain(s) that contains the ZPI interactive site(s) of the cofactor. To investigate the role of the light chain and heavy chain homologues of PZ in interaction with ZPI and to provide further insight into the mechanism of the cofactor function of PZ, we developed an expression/purification system for PZ and expressed a recombinant wild type (rPZ), a deletion mutant lacking its Gla domain (GD-PZ) and a chimeric form of PZ in which the light chain homologue of the molecule has been substituted with the same regions of factor X (exons encoding Gla, hydrophobic stack, EGF1 and EGF2 domains). The cofactor function of the PZ derivatives were characterized in both binding and inhibition assays using recombinant ZPI. The results indicate that the chimeric PZ interacts with ZPI with a normal affinity in the direct binding assay in the absence of PC/PS vesicles; it however, exhibits ∼6-fold weaker affinity for the inhibitor in the fXa inhibition assay on the negatively charged phospholipid vesicles in the presence of Ca2+. The cofactor activity of the chimeric PZ in the ZPI inhibition of fXa was also decreased 6-fold under the same conditions. The cofactor activity of GD-PZ was dramatically impaired on PC/PS vesicles, though the mutant exhibited a normal cofactor activity in solution. Interestingly, an activated protein C chimera containing the Gla domain of fXa reacted with ZPI in the presence, but not in the absence of PZ on PC/PS vesicles in the presence of Ca2+. We conclude that the ZPI interactive site of PZ is located within the C-terminal heavy chain homologue of the cofactor. Furthermore, PZ interacts with the Gla domain of fXa to facilitate the formation of a ternary complex, and the association of the serpin with the protease on the negatively charged membrane surface. Construction, Mutagenesis, and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—A PZ cDNA containing three extraneous point mutations (obtained from Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) was subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI restriction enzyme sites of the pRc/RSV mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and converted to the wild-type form by repairing the mutations by PCR mutagenesis methods. To facilitate the purification of PZ, the sequence of a 12-residue epitope for a Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody, HPC4, was also ligated to the 3′-end of the cDNA immediately before the native stop codon of the cofactor. The accuracy of the PZ cDNA in the expression vector was confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA. The PZ chimera in which the exons encoding the light chain homologue were replaced with the same exons encoding the light chain of fXa (Gla, hydrophobic stack, and both EGF-like domains) (PZ-fX/LC) was prepared by the PCR mutagenesis approach using the same HPC4-tagged PZ cDNA sequence. The expression vectors, which contain a neomycin gene for the G418 resistant selection, were transferred to human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, several G418-resistant clones were selected and examined for PZ expression by an ELISA using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal anti-PZ antibody obtained from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). A clone positive for the expression of each PZ derivative was identified, expanded, and 20 liters of cell culture supernatant were collected, concentrated, and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the HPC4 antibody linked to Affigel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described (12Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HPC4 eluates were further chromatographed on a Mono Q column using a gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl as described (13Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins from single preparations were frozen at –80 °C in small aliquots until use. Because of a very poor yield in the mammalian expression system, the Gla-domainless PZ (GD-PZ lacking residues 1–47) was expressed in the InsectSelect system (Invitrogen) using the pIZ/V5-His expression vector transfected to sf21 insect cells according to the manufacturer's instruction. The construction strategy was such that the sequence of His tag in the vector remained downstream of the stop codon for GD-PZ; thus it was not incorporated into the sequence of the mutant cofactor as we described previously for the expression of other proteins in this system (14Qureshi S.H.

The activated protein C mutants in which either the Gla domain or both the Gla and the first EGF-like domains of the protease were replaced with the corresponding regions of fXa (APC-fX/Gla and APC-fX/Gla/EGF1) were expressed in the same expression system as described (17Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Thromb. Haemostas. 2007; 97: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Human plasma protein Z (PZ) and fXa were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described (18Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrates, S2765 and Spectrozyme PCa (SpPCa) were purchased from American Diagnostica (Green-wich, CT). Inhibition Assays—The time course and concentration dependence of fXa inhibition by ZPI was studied both in the absence and presence of PZ derivatives on PC/PS vesicles under pseudo-first-order conditions as described (15Rezaie A.R. Manithody C. Yang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32722-32728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the absence of PZ, fXa derivatives (1 nm) were incubated with ZPI (100–250 nm) on PC/PS vesicles (20 μm) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 5 mm Ca2+ (TBS/Ca2+) for 30–120 min in 50-μl volumes in 96-well polystyrene plates at room temperature as described (15Rezaie A.R. Manithody C. Yang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32722-32728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the presence of PZ, the reaction conditions were the same except that fXa was incubated with ZPI (5–40 nm) in complex with a saturating concentration of PZ derivatives (100 nm) for 15 s to 10 min on PC/PS vesicles (20 μm) in the same TBS buffer system. The inactivation reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of S2765 (0.2 mm final) in TBS containing 50 mm EDTA, and the remaining enzyme activity was measured with a Vmax Kinetics Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) at 405 nm. The cofactor concentration dependence of the ZPI inhibition of fXa indicated that PZ concentrations are saturating under these conditions. The observed pseudo-first-order (kobs) rate constants were calculated from a first-order rate equation and the second-order rate constants (k2) were calculated from the slope of linear plots of kobs values versus PZ-ZPI complex concentrations as described (15Rezaie A.R. Manithody C. Yang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32722-32728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constants of PZ derivatives for interaction with ZPI were estimated from the hyperbolic dependence of kobs values on PZ concentrations in the presence of a fixed concentration of ZPI (5 nm) on PC/PS in TBS/Ca2+. Interaction with ZPI—The affinity of PZ derivatives for interaction with ZPI was evaluated by an ELISA-based binding assay using 96-well flat microtiter plates coated with a polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml) to ZPI in TBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 overnight at 4 °C. After washing plates three times with the same TBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, they were incubated with 1% BSA in TBS/Ca2+ for 2 h at room temperature. After the plates were washed three times, they were incubated with ZPI (2 μg/ml) for 1 h followed by washing and incubation with PZ derivatives (0–200 nm in TBS/Ca2+ containing 0.1% BSA) for another 1 h. After the plates were washed again, they were incubated with a goat anti-PZ polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) for 1 h. Then, the plates were washed and incubated with rabbit anti-goat IgG (KPL, MD, 1:1000) for 1 h. After washing, the plates were incubated with 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazo-line-6-sulfonate) (ABTS; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Colorimetric analysis was performed by measuring absorbance values at 405 nm as described above. All treatments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. In a variation of this assay, the microtiter plate was directly coated with ZPI (2 μg/ml), and the binding of PZ derivatives to the serpin was evaluated as described above. Competitive Binding—The competitive effect of the GD-PZ mutant on fXa inhibition by ZPI in the presence of wild-type PZ was studied using the same discontinuous assay method described above. In this case, the inhibition of fXa (0.5 nm) by ZPI (5 nm) in the presence of pPZ (10 nm) was monitored as a function of increasing concentrations of GD-PZ (0–1000 nm) in TBS/Ca2+ on PC/PS vesicles (20 μm). Following 2–5 min incubation at room temperature, 50 μl of S2765 was added to each well, and the remaining activity of fXa was measured as described above. Under these experimental conditions, ∼80% of the enzyme activity in the absence of the competitor was inhibited. The apparent dissociation constant was determined from the non-linear regression analysis of the saturable GD-PZ concentration dependence for recovery of the enzyme activity monitored by the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate at 405 nm as described above. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant PZ derivatives were expressed in HEK-293 (rPZ and PZ-fX/LC chimera) or insect cells (GD-PZ) in fusion with the 12-residue epitope for the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal HPC4 antibody to facilitate their purification by immunoaffinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thus, following passage of the supernatants through the immobilized HPC4 antibody, the substitution of Ca2+ with EDTA in the wash buffer was sufficient to elute the recombinant proteins from the antibody column as described (15Rezaie A.R. Manithody C. Yang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32722-32728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The HPC4 eluates for rPZ and PZ-fX/LC chimera were further purified by an anion exchange chromatography employing a Mono Q column as described (13Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions suggested that the expressed proteins have been purified to homogeneity and both rPZ and PZ-fX/LC chimera migrate as single bands with expected molecular masses of ∼62 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3), the same value observed for the plasma-derived PZ (lane 1). The GD-PZ mutant expressed in the insect cells migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼45 kDa under the same conditions (Fig. 1, lane 4). Interaction with ZPI—The PZ concentration dependence of the ZPI inhibition of fXa on PC/PS vesicles suggested that both pPZ and rPZ exhibit similar cofactor activity, thus promoting the ZPI inhibition of fXa with Kd(app) values of 1.1 nm and 1.4 nm, respectively, on PC/PS vesicles in the presence of calcium (Fig. 2A). Relative to rPZ, the corresponding value for the PZ-fX/LC chimera (8.7 nm) was elevated ∼6-fold (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the chimera, the cofactor activity of GD-PZ was dramatically impaired (see below) and thus the data with this mutant could not be included in this figure. Nevertheless, the GD-PZ mutant functioned as an effective competitor of fXa inhibition by the PZ-ZPI complex on PC/PS vesicles with a Kd(app) value of 29 ± 5 nm (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the ZPI interactive site is located within GD-PZ. The interaction of PZ derivatives with ZPI was also evaluated by an ELISA binding assay in the absence of PC/PS vesicles, but the presence of Ca2+. Interestingly, all PZ derivatives (pPZ, rPZ, PZ-fX/LC, and GD-PZ) interacted with ZPI with similar dissociation constants of 7–8 nm in this assay (Fig. 3). The results of the binding assays were essentially identical whether or not the interactions were analyzed with ZPI being directly bound to the ELISA plate or the serpin was first captured on the plate by a polyclonal antibody to ZPI. These results suggest that all recombinant PZ derivatives have been folded properly and that the ZPI interactive site of PZ is located within the C-terminal heavy chain homologue of the cofactor. We also conducted the binding assays in the presence of 1 mm EDTA. In this case, however, no interaction for ZPI was detected with any of the PZ derivatives. Whether the lack of binding was due to a Ca2+ requirement for the PZ-ZPI interaction was not investigated.FIGURE 3The binding of PZ derivatives to ZPI. An ELISA-based binding assay using a polyclonal anti-ZPI (2 μg/ml) as the capture antibody was used to evaluate the affinity of PZ derivatives for interaction with the serpin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The symbols are: pPZ (○), rPZ (•), PZ-fX/LC chimera (□), and GD-PZ (▪). The non-linear regression analysis of data according to a hyperbolic equation yielded KD values of 7.5 ± 0.5 nm for pPZ, 7.1 ± 0.1 nm for rPZ, 8.4 ± 0.1 nm for PZ-fX/LC, and 7.1 ± 0.2 nm for GD-PZ. Data are derived from averages of at least 2–3 independent measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cofactor Effects of PZ Derivatives in the ZPI Inhibition of fXa—The second-order association rate constants for the PZ-mediated ZPI inhibition of fXa were determined from the slope of the linear plots of kobs values in the presence of saturating concentrations of PZ derivatives (Fig. 4), which are presented in Table 1. The second-order association rate constant for the ZPI inhibition of fXa ((2.1 ± 0.2) × 106) in the presence of the plasma-derived PZ was essentially similar to the same value observed in the presence of rPZ ((1.8 ± 0.2) × 106), suggesting that both PZ and rPZ promote the ZPI inhibition of fXa to a similar extent of ∼2000-fold. Relative to rPZ, the cofactor activity of the PZ-fX/LC chimera was decreased 6-fold, which correlates well with the 6-fold elevated Kd(app) observed for the mutant in the inhibition assay presented in Fig. 2. The basis for the lower cofactor activity of the PZ chimera appears to be due to the loss of an interaction between the Gla domains of fXa and PZ on PC/PS vesicles, because an fXa chimera containing the Gla domain of activated protein C (APC) also reacted with ZPI with ∼3-fold lower k2 value (Table 1). Further support for the existence of a specific interaction between the Gla domains of PZ and fXa was provided by the observation that the APC chimeras containing either the Gla or both the Gla and EGF1 domains of fXa reacted with ZPI in the presence of PZ on PC/PS vesicles (Table 1). In the absence of PZ no reactivity for the APC chimeras was detected under the same experimental conditions. Wild-type APC did not react with ZPI in either the absence or presence of PZ on PC/PS vesicles. These results suggest that the C-terminal heavy chain homologue of PZ contains the interactive-site for ZPI with the N-terminal Gla domain of the cofactor also interacting with fXa, thereby contributing to optimal ZPI inhibition of fXa on the negatively charged phospholipid membrane. In agreement with this hypothesis, the PZ-mediated ZPI inhibition of the fXa mutant lacking the first EGF1 domain exhibited an ∼4-fold decreased k2 value, as this result has also been reported previously (15Rezaie A.R. Manithody C. Yang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32722-32728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This impairment in the interaction is not likely due to the loss of a specific interaction of the EGF1 domain of fXa with PZ because both wild-type fXa and an fXa mutant lacking both the Gla and EGF1 domains (E2-fXa) exhibited similar reactivity with ZPI in complex with either PZ or GD-PZ in the absence of PC/PS vesicles in TBS/Ca2+ (data not presented). Furthermore, similar k2 values were obtained for the reaction of fXa with both wild-type PZ (5.0 ± 0.5 × 103 m–1 s–1) and GD-PZ (6.2 ± 0.1 × 103 m–1 s–1) in solution, suggesting an ∼6-fold cofactor effect for GD-PZ in the ZPI inhibition reactions. These results indicate that the assembly of both PZ and fXa on PC/PS vesicles is essential for the effective ZPI inhibition of fXa. However, analysis of results with Gla domain chimeric proteases suggest that most of the cofactor effect of the PZ Gla domain can be recapitulated by Gla domains of other vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins. A specific interaction between the Gla domains of PZ and fXa makes a modest 5–6-fold contribution to the acceleration of the reaction.TABLE 1Second-order rate (k2) constants for the ZPI inhibition of fXa derivatives in the absence and presence of PZ derivatives on PC/PS vesiclesProtease-Cofactor+rPZ+PZ-fX/LCfXa(8.8 ± 0.4) × 102(1.8 ± 0.2) × 106(3.0 ± 0.2) × 105fXa-APC/Gla(8.6 ± 0.8) × 102(6.5 ± 0.3) × 105—a(—), not determined.fXa-desEGF1(7.9 ± 0.2) × 102(4.6 ± 0.4) × 105—APC-fX/GlabAPC-fX/Gla, activated protein C mutant in which the Gla domain has been replaced with the corresponding domain of factor X.NDcND, no decline in the amidolytic activity of APC derivatives was detected in the absence of PZ under these conditions.(1.2 ± 0.3) × 102—APC-fX/Gla/EGF1dAPC-fX/Gla/EGF1, activated protein C mutant in which both the Gla and EGF1 domains have been replaced with the corresponding domains of factor X.ND(0.9 ± 0.1) × 102—a (—), not determined.b APC-fX/Gla, activated protein C mutant in which the Gla domain has been replaced with the corresponding domain of factor X.c ND, no decline in the amidolytic activity of APC derivatives was detected in the absence of PZ under these conditions.d APC-fX/Gla/EGF1, activated protein C mutant in which both the Gla and EGF1 domains have been replaced with the corresponding domains of factor X. Open table in a new tab Noting that the reactivity of fXa with ZPI was minimally affected by PC/PS vesicles in the absence of PZ, the 6-fold cofactor effect of GD-PZ in the ZPI inhibition of the protease may thus be attributed to a conformational change in the reactive center loop of the serpin. Alternatively, the cofactor function of PZ may involve structural changes in a secondary binding site of ZPI, thus optimizing its interaction with an exosite of fXa, as we have previously identified Arg-143 as a critical residue on the autolysis loop of fXa which interacts with an unidentified site of ZPI (15Rezaie A.R. Manithody C. Yang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32722-32728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), by a mechanism similar to that observed with pentasaccharide activation of antithrombin (19Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further studies will be required to validate these hypotheses. Previous fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies have indicated that the binding of the Gla domain of fXa to PC/PS vesicles positions the active site of the protease some 60–70 Å above the membrane surface (20Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that a key cofactor role for PZ may involve maintaining the reactive center loop of ZPI at an appropriate height above the same membrane surface on which fXa is bound. In the context of this model, the first EGF domain of ZPI could play a spacer function to properly accommodate ZPI into the active site pocket of the membrane-bound enzyme without making any specific interaction with fXa in the ternary complex. A similar role for the EGF1 domain of fXa has been postulated in the prothrombinase complex (14Qureshi S.H. Yang L. Yegneswaran S. Rezaie A.R. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of the spacer function of EGF1 most likely accounts for ∼4-fold lower second-order rate constant observed for the PZ-mediated ZPI inhibition of fXa-desEGF1 on PC/PS vesicles. Further support for lack of an interactive site for EGF1 of PZ is provided by the observation that all fXa derivatives including E2-fXa lacking both the Gla and EGF1 domains reacted with similar k2 values with PZ and GD-PZ in solution in the absence of a membrane surface. In summary, we have shown in this study that the ZPI interactive site of PZ is located within the C-terminal heavy chain homologue of the cofactor. PZ binds to ZPI a KD of ∼7 nm in the direct binding assay and a KD(app) of ∼1 nm on PC/PS vesicles in the inhibition assay. The Gla domain of PZ also makes a specific interaction with the Gla domain of fXa on the negatively charged membrane surface. The Gla-Gla interaction contributes ∼6-fold to the cofactor effect of PZ in the fXa inhibition reaction. A further ∼6-fold cofactor effect of PZ appears to be mediated through the PZ altering the conformation of ZPI, and the remaining cofactor activity of PZ in the promotion of fXa inhibition can be attributed to a Gla and Ca2+-dependent assembly of fXa and PZ-ZPI complex on PC/PS vesicles, which can be recapitulated by the Gla domains of other vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2002011854,"The detailed structural basis for the cryptic nature (crypticity) of a B cell epitope harbored by an autoantigen is unknown. Because the immune system may be ignorant of the existence of such ""cryptic"" epitopes, their exposure could be an important feature in autoimmunity. Here we investigated the structural basis for the crypticity of the epitopes of the Goodpasture autoantigen, the alpha3alpha4alpha5 noncollagenous-1 (NC1) hexamer, a globular domain that connects two triple-helical molecules of the alpha3alpha4alpha5 collagen IV network. The NC1 hexamer occurs in two isoforms as follows: the M-isoform composed of monomer subunits in which the epitopes are accessible to autoantibodies, and the D-isoform composed of both monomer and dimer subunits in which the epitopes are cryptic. The D-isoform was characterized with respect to quaternary structure, as revealed by mass spectrometry of dimer subunits, homology modeling, and molecular dynamics simulation. The results revealed that the D-isoform contains two kinds of cross-links as follows: S-hydroxylysyl-methionine and S-lysyl-methionine cross-links, which stabilize the alpha3alpha5-heterodimers and alpha4alpha4-homodimers, respectively. Construction and analysis of a three-dimensional model of the D-isoform of the alpha3alpha4alpha5 NC1 hexamer revealed that crypticity is a consequence of the following: (a) sequestration of key residues between neighboring subunits that are stabilized by domain-swapping interactions, and (b) by cross-linking of subunits at the trimer-trimer interface, which stabilizes the structural integrity of the NC1 hexamer and protects against binding of autoantibodies. The sequestrated epitopes and cross-linked subunits represent a novel structural mechanism for conferring immune privilege at the level of quaternary structure. Perturbation of the quaternary structure may be a key factor in the etiology of Goodpasture disease."

The Ser substitution leads to the decreased ability of soluble THBS-2 signature domain protein to bind 4B6.13, a conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope in repeat 1C.

Group A THBSs (THBS-1 and THBS-2) form trimers and are composed of an N-terminal module, an oligomerization domain, a von Willebrand Factor type C homology module, three THBS type 1 or properdin modules, and a signature domain comprising three epidermal growth factor-like modules (EGF1, EGF2, and EGF3), a calcium-binding wire, and a C-terminal lectin-like module (Fig. 1A).

There is an insert in repeat 1C of the wire that contains an Asn-Ala-Thr glycosylation sequence in THBS-1 and THBS-2 (Fig. 1, B and C). The THBS-2 signature domain binds 30 calcium ions, with one calcium ion present in EGF2 at the EGF1-EGF2 interface, 26 sites in the wire, and three sites in the lectin-like module. The structure of the THBS-2 signature domain revealed extensive interactions among EGF2, EGF3, the wire, and the lectin-like module (Fig. 1B). Most strikingly, the wire wraps around the lectin-like module, making contact at repeats 1C and 9C. EGF2 and EGF3 also interact with the wire-lectin complex (5Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S.

When considered in the context of the crystal structure of the THBS-1 and THBS-2 signature domains, these genetic changes map to the wire and lectin-like modules (4Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The polymorphic residue in THBS-1 (N700S) associated with premature coronary artery disease is at position 10 of wire repeat 1C (Fig. 1C) near the interaction sites among EGF3, the wire, and the lectin-like module (5Carlson C.B.

Remarkably, position 10 of all 13 wire repeats of all five vertebrate THBSs is an Asn or Asp (2Adams, J. C., Tucker, R. P., and Lawler, J. (1995) in The Thrombospondin Gene Family, pp. 11–42, R. G.

A study of the effects of calcium ions on THBS-1 constructs containing EGF3 and the wire revealed that a change in calcium concentration is associated with a change in the fluorescence of Trp698. This transition occurs at higher calcium concentrations and with greater cooperativity in the Ser700 protein than the Asn700 protein (13Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Pranghofer M.M. Mosher D.F. J.

The homologous residue in THBS-2, Asn702, coordinates a calcium ion through a water molecule (Fig. 1, B and 1C), a finding consistent with the altered kinetics of a calcium-induced conformational change associated with the Ser700 allele (5Carlson C.B.

It is not known whether the Asn to Ser change in THBS-1 causes a loss of a calcium-binding site or changes after filling of the site. It is also not known how the Ser allele impacts stability and structure of specific parts of the protein, which could lead to the changes in protein function implied in the link to disease. In this study, we sought to answer these questions about the structural consequences of the THBS-1 N700S single nucleotide polymorphism by investigating the changes in thermal stability of the THBS-1 signature domain and investigating the homologous N702S change in the signature domain of THBS-2, for which, unlike THBS-1, there is a crystal structure (5Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol.

We found that the presence of the Ser allele alters the structure and stability of wire repeat 1C and the EFG-like modules, compared with the Asn-containing proteins. Protein Cloning—The pAcGP67.coco baculovirus transfer vector encoding a secretion signal peptide 5′ to the cloning site followed by DNA encoding a short linker and six-histidine tag was used to enable baculovirus-driven protein expression, secretion, and subsequent purification (15Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Signature domain THBS-2 comprises residues 551–1172 with ADP and ARGHHHHHH N- and C-terminal tails. The Ser702 allele was introduced by PCR mutagenesis into DNA encoding the signature domain THBS-2. Correct orientation and sequence of PCR-amplified DNA were verified by sequencing. Asn700 and Ser700 THBS-1 signature domain proteins (residues 549–1170 with ADP and NAAGHHHHHH N- and C-terminal tails), 4C-1, the lectin-like module with 10 adjacent wire repeats protein (residues 775–1170 ADP and NAGHHHHHH N- and C-terminal tails), EGF3-Wire-1, the third EGF-like module with the calcium-binding wire protein, (described previously (12Hannah B.L.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The Asn702 and Ser702 THBS-2 proteins were expressed by infecting High Five insect cells in SF900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C with high titer virus (>1 E108 plaque-forming units/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of ∼5. Conditioned medium was collected ∼65 h post-infection. Histidine-tagged proteins were purified from the medium in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and, if necessary, an anion-exchange HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare), as described previously (5Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm less the absorbance at 320 nm and divided by the calculated extinction coefficient of 1.24 ml mg–1 cm–1 (THBS-2 proteins), 1.2 ml mg–1 cm–1 (THBS-1 signature domain proteins), 1.33 ml mg–1 cm–1 (4C-1), 2.42 ml mg–1 cm–1 (E123-1), or 0.81 ml mg–1 cm–1 (EGF-Wire-1) (16Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—DSC experiments were performed at the University of Wisconsin Biophysics Instrumentation Facility using a Microcal VP-differential scanning calorimeter equipped with Origin 7 software. Proteins (8.3–25 μm) were dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm or 200 μm CaCl2, pH 7.5. Scans were conducted from 15 to 95 °C at a rate of 60 °C h–1, except EGF123-1, which was scanned from 15 to 85 °C. Appropriate buffer scans were used for reference subtraction and data were normalized using protein concentrations, including an estimated 2% dilution upon introduction into the DSC sample cell. Area-fitting analyses were performed with the DSC Origin 7 software package. Manual-fit baselines were subtracted from sample scans that were corrected for reference sample and concentration. This curve was then fitted to a non-2-state model with various numbers of peaks. Fits were refined using several iterations until the χ2 value stabilized. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Asn702 and Ser702 THBS-2 signature domain protein were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates at 10 μgml–1 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, plus 2 mm CaCl2. The plates were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS plus 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST). The monoclonal antibody 4B6.13 (14Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27067-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was diluted in TBST containing various concentrations of CaCl2 and then incubated with the plate for 2 h. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was added for a 1-h incubation. Sigma 104 AP substrate at 1 mg ml–1 in TBS, pH 9.0, was added to each well and color development was monitored at 405 nm. As a control, we used polyclonal rabbit anti-human THBS-2 antibodies (18Tooney P.A. Sakai T. Sakai K. Aeschlimann D. Mosher D.F. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to confirm that antigen protein was adsorbed to the plate and present at similar concentrations. The proteins were tested in competition ELISA as described (14Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27067-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to assess if soluble antigen was able to compete with surface-adsorbed antigen for binding of the monoclonal antibody. All ELISA experiments were repeated, each with triplicate data points, on multiple occasions. Data are expressed as the mean of the different experiments ± S.E. Protein Crystallization—The Ser702 THBS-2 signature domain was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Protein was first exchanged into 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m sodium acetate. Protein was then concentrated to 7–10 mg ml–1 using Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter units (Millipore). Drops were made from 0.9 μl of protein mixed with 0.9 μl of mother liquor (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5–9.0, 200 mm sodium acetate, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000) and 0.1 μl of 1 m glycine. Crystal formation was facilitated by streak seeding from Asn702 THBS-2 signature domain crystals (5Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Prior to data collection, crystals were stabilized by transfer to a cryoprotectant solution of the above mother liquor conditions supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol and then frozen directly in liquid nitrogen. Protein Crystal Data Collection and Analysis—Data were collected using a Proteum CCD detector with x-rays generated by a Microstar rotating anode (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI). Data were indexed and scaled using HKL2000 (19Otwinowski, Z., and Minor, W. (1997) in Methods in Enzymology (Carter, C. W., and Sweet, R. M., eds) Vol. 276 A, pp. 307–326, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The structure was solved to 2.9-Å resolution using AMORE (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) for molecular replacement with the Asn702 THBS-2 signature domain protein as a search model (5Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A.

Refinement with REFMAC5 (21CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) produced interpretable 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc electron density maps. The model was improved by rounds of refinement with REFMAC5 and manual rebuilding using O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) and Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

There was one molecule per asymmetric unit. 73.7% of all residues fall in the most favored Ramachandran category, with 23.8% in the allowed category, 2.1% in the generously allowed category, and 0.4% in the disallowed category. Superpose and root mean squared analyses of Cα carbons were calculated using the CCP4 suite of programs (21CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The Polymorphism Leads to Altered Thermal Stability of the EGF-like Modules and the Wire—To examine the impact of the Ser allele on stability of the signature domain and its specific parts, we examined the thermal melting profiles of THBS-1 and THBS-2 proteins having Asn or Ser at the position of the THBS-1 polymorphism (700 of THBS-1 and 702 of THBS-2). The DSC profile of the Asn700 THBS-1 signature domain in 2 mm calcium had four apparent melting events at 46.1, 53.7, 72.1, and 88.6 °C (Fig. 2A). The first two peaks were not reversible upon cooling and reheating, whereas the second two peaks were reversible (not shown). To identify the origins of these peaks, we studied various truncations of the THBS-1 signature domain (Fig. 2A). A construct comprising the three tandem EGF-like modules of THBS-1 (EGF123-1) melted reversibly with one peak at 68.0 °C. The EGF3-wire construct (EGF3-wire-1) melted reversibly with one peak at 87 °C. Because secretion of the lectin-like module requires a portion of the wire that mediates the wire repeat 9C-lectin interaction (4Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we examined a construct containing the lectin-like module and portion of the calcium-binding wire that includes repeats 4C to 13C (4C-1), including the wire repeat 9C-lectin interface (Fig. 1A). This protein melted with a non-reversible peak at 47.5 °C, followed by the beginning of a second peak at >90 °C, which was reversible. Alignment of the DSC curves (Fig. 2A) suggests that the first or second peak of the signature domain likely represents the melting of the wire repeat 9C-lectin interface, and the third and fourth peaks likely represent the melting of the EGF-like modules and the wire. Based on previous studies of the THBS-2 signature domain constructs (24Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (see below), we suspect that the other of the first two peaks represents melting of the wire repeat 1C-lectin interface. Compared with the Asn700 THBS-1 protein, the Ser700 THBS-1 protein also had two non-reversible melting events at 47.3 and 53.8 °C, but instead of the 72 and 88.6 °C peaks, there was a broad two-part reversible peak from 75 to 95 °C (Fig. 2A). Thus, the reversible high temperature melting events attributed to the EGF-like and wire modules are impacted by the amino acid substitution, whereas the non-reversible low temperature events are not. Previous studies with a THBS-1 construct comprising EGF3 and the wire demonstrated that the Ser allele is more susceptible to heat denaturation in 200 μm calcium, compared with the Asn-containing protein (12Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine if this is also seen in the signature domain protein, the thermal stability of Asn- and Ser-containing proteins were examined at 200 μm calcium, using DSC. At 200 μm calcium, the Asn700 protein melted with two apparent peaks at 43.5 and 69.4 °C. The Ser700 protein melted with an apparent three-part peak from 40 to 70 °C (Fig. 2B). Lowering the calcium concentration to 200 μm, therefore, lowers the temperatures of the reversible transitions and, as in 2 mm calcium, the Ser700 protein was more sensitive to heating than the Asn700 protein. The four peaks seen in the THBS-1 proteins contrasts with DSC studies on the signature domain of THBS-2, which melts with two peaks (24Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The first peak (non-reversible) of the THBS-2 protein has been assigned to the melting of the lectin-wire interfaces and the second peak (reversible) has been assigned to the melting of the wire itself (24Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the two THBS-2 peaks are each compound transitions comprising two melting events, we used area-fitting analyses assuming a non-two-state model based on the nonreversible status of the low temperature events. We fit the Asn702 THBS-2 melting profiles to a four-event model and a two-event model. The Asn702 THBS-2 curve modeled as two events (52.2 and 81.1 °C) had a χ2 of 8.5 × 105 (not shown), whereas this curve had a χ2 value of 7.4 × 104 for a four-event model (51.0, 53.1, 78.8, and 82.7 °C) (Fig. 2D), compatible with the hypothesis that the transitions seen for both THBS-1 and THBS-2 proteins are reporting four (or more) events. The DSC profile of the THBS-2 signature domain with the homologous Asn to Ser change, N702S, also fit best modeled as four events. When modeled as two events (50.9 and 77.6 °C), the Ser702 THBS-2 curve had a χ2 value of 2.3 × 106 (not shown) that decreased to 7.5 × 104 when modeled as four events (50.0, 51.0, 66.5, and 78.8 °C) (Fig. 2E). However, the melting events are altered in the Ser702 protein, compared with the Asn702 protein (Fig. 2C). The largest changes are seen in the reversible high temperature events where the Asn702 82.7 °C event is shifted to 78.8 °C in the Ser702 protein, and the Asn702 78.8 °C event is shifted to 66.5 °C in the Ser702 protein. Smaller changes are seen in the nonreversible low temperature events, where the Asn702 53.1 °C event is shifted to 51.0 °C in the Ser702 protein and the Asn702 51.0 °C event is shifted to 50.0 °C in the Ser702 protein. Thus, the major changes in the DSC pattern due to Ser702 are of the reversible high temperature events, and as with the THBS-1 protein, indicate changes in stability of the EGF-like and wire modules. Mutation of Asn to Ser Does Not Lead to a Loss of Calcium—A possible structural explanation for observed changes in protein stability in the Ser-containing proteins is that the Ser700 allele and Ser702 mutant are associated with a loss of a bound calcium ion. Residue 700/702 is located at position 10 of the consensus sequence found in both C-type and N-type wire repeats (Fig. 1C). Asp or Asn are invariably present at this position, and the residue coordinates calcium directly or through a water, as revealed in crystal structures of THBS-1 and THBS-2 signature domain proteins (4Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Asn702 coordinates calcium through a water molecule (Fig. 1, B and C) (5Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 76% identity between the sequences of THBS-1 and THBS-2 signature domain proteins and the changes in kinetics of the conformational transition induced by calcium and reported by adjacent Trp698 in Ser700 THBS-1 proteins (13Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Pranghofer M.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51915-51922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) argue for a similar calcium-binding role for Asn700 in THBS-1 (Fig. 1C). To examine the impact of the N700S polymorphism on calcium coordination, we first attempted to study the Asn700 and Ser700 THBS-1 signature domain proteins by crystallography. Our attempts to crystallize the Asn700 signature domain of THBS-1, including the C992S derivative used to stabilize and crystallize a portion of the THBS-1 signature domain (4Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), were unsuccessful. We therefore addressed this question by solving the crystal structure of the Ser702 THBS-2 signature domain in 2 mm calcium. The Ser702 protein crystallized under the same conditions used for the Asn702 protein"

We extend these studies to include GATC sites involved in diverse gene regulatory and DNA replication pathways as well as sites previously shown to undergo differential in vivo methylation but whose function remains to be assigned. EcoDam shows no change in affinity with variations in flanking sequences derived from these sources, but methylation kinetics varied 12-fold. A-tracts immediately adjacent to the GATC site contribute significantly to these differences in methylation kinetics. Interestingly, only when the poly(A) is located 5′ of the GATC are the changes in methylation kinetics revealed. Preferential methylation is obscured when two GATC sites are positioned on the same DNA molecule, unless both sites are surrounded by large amounts of nonspecific DNA. Thus, facilitated diffusion and sequences immediately flanking target sites contribute to higher order specificity for EcoDam; we suggest that the diverse biological roles of the enzyme are in part regulated by these two factors, which may be important for other enzymes that sequence-specifically modify DNA.

Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Casadesus J. Low D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 830-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). EcoDam homologues are found in many γ-proteobacteria, such as Salmonella typhimurium (7Heithoff D.M. Sinsheimer R.L. Low D.A. Mahan M.J. Science. 1999; 284: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (8Julio S.M. Heithoff D.M. Provenzano D. Klose K.E. Sinsheimer R.L. Low D.A. Mahan M.J. Infect.

Lett. 2001; 195: 223-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Hemophilus influenzae (10Piekarowicz A. Brzezinski R. Kauc L. Acta Microbiol. Pol. Ser. A Microbiol. Gen. 1975; 7: 51-65PubMed Google Scholar). Further, a growing number of bacterial pathogens have been found to require methylation for virulence (11Heusipp G. Falker S. Schmidt M.A. Int. J. Med. Microbiology. 2007; 297: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The lack of adenine methylation in higher eukaryotes has sparked interest in targeting EcoDam for the development of new antibiotics (12Mashhoon N. Pruss C. Carroll M. Johnson P.H. Reich N.O. J. Biomol. Screening. 2006; 11: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), thus making a thorough understanding of both the structure and mechanism of this enzyme critical. Monomeric EcoDam binds and methylates the N-6 position of the adenine in the DNA sequence 5′-GATC-3′ (13Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gene expression and proteomic studies of bacteria in which the EcoDam gene has been deleted show extreme and widespread changes in RNA and protein levels, in many cases involving well characterized virulence factors (14Oshima T.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7901-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Within the E. coli genome, ∼0.1–0.2% of the ∼20,000 GATC sites are undermethylated in vivo (18Tavazoie S. Church G.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Wang M.X. Church G.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Most of these GATC sites are found in the 5′-noncoding region of various genes, indicating that they could be involved in gene regulation. Additionally, chromosome replication is regulated in part by the methylation state of the GATC sites within the origin (20Smith D.W. Garland A.M. Herman G. Enns R.E. Baker T.A. Zyskind J.W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 489-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The GATC sites located within the origin of replication and those differentially methylated in the E. coli genome are thought to be protected from methylation by the presence of a competing protein. For example, SeqA preferentially binds at least two hemimethylated GATC sites in the origin of replication, thereby contributing to the lag in methylation of these sites relative to those within the genome (22Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Skarstad K. Lueder G. Lurz R. Speck C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although other factors are thought to contribute to the slow remethylation of the origin (25Bach T. Skarstad K. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Campbell J.L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 62: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 27Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), this sequestration of GATC sites is required for proper timing of chromosome replication. Characterized systems such as the bacterial origin of replication aid in the explanation of the lack of methylation at some genomic GATCs; however, the factors contributing to the lack of methylation at others are poorly understood. EcoDam shows a dramatic preference for the in vitro methylation of certain GATC sequences in plasmids and PCR-derived DNA fragments. For example, Guschlbauer and co-workers detected no methylation of some GATC sites on pBR322, whereas other sites are nearly completely methylated (28Bergerat A. Kriebardis A. Guschlbauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4064-4070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The linear or supercoiled nature of the plasmid had no affect on which GATC sites were preferentially methylated. Pili expression in E. coli is dependent upon the methylation state of two GATC sites located proximal (GATCprox) and distal (GATCdist) to the papAB gene within the pap promoter (29Blyn L.B. Braaten B.A. Low D.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4045-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Hernday A.D. Braaten B.A. Low D.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 947-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our previous work on these regulatory GATCs within the pap operon showed a 23-fold decrease in methylation kinetics when compared with a site known to undergo rapid methylation (31Peterson S.N. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This preference is enhanced when poorly and rapidly methylated sites are positioned on the same DNA molecule. More recently, Zonoviev et al. (32Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Sclavi B. Buckle M. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the EcoDam ortholog T4Dam also differentially methylates two GATC sites that are both located on a 40-base pair DNA molecule. Here we extend our original investigation of the modulation of EcoDam methylation kinetics by flanking sequences (31Peterson S.N. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to include GATC sites involved in other pathways. Our results show that the flanking sequences immediately adjacent to the GATC are important for determining the efficiency of methylation for many of these GATC sites. This effect is further dependent on the surrounding nonspecific DNA involving hundreds of flanking base pairs. The higher order specificity observed may contribute to the multiple levels of regulation controlling the various biological pathways in which EcoDam participates. Enzyme Expression and Purification—EcoDam was expressed and purified as previously described (33Mashhoon N. Carroll M. Pruss C. Eberhard J. Ishikawa S. Estabrook R.A. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52075-52081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, EcoDam was overexpressed in XL2-Blue (Stratagene) E. coli cells grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. Once an A600 of 0.4–0.6 was reached, cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.05% l-arabinose and grown for 2 h at 37 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 40–60 ml of P-11 buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol) and lysed by a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 60-ml phosphocellulose (Whatman) column. The protein was eluted with a salt gradient between 0.2 and 0.8 M NaCl, and those fractions containing EcoDam were pooled and dialyzed in BS buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol). The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a 20-ml Blue Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) column preequilibrated in BS buffer, and protein was eluted with a salt gradient between 0 and 1.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing EcoDam were flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C. Concentrations were determined using the extinction coefficient 1.16 ml mg–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. DNA Substrates—All DNA oligonucleotides (Table 1 and Fig. 5) and their reverse complements were ordered from Operon or Midland and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). The sequences corresponding to the GATC sites found in the pap operon (WTpapdist and WTpapprox; Table 1) were designed based on the native sequences found in the E. coli genome, including the 8–9 base pairs flanking the 5′- and 3′-end of the GATC (Table 1). The sequence for the mutated papdist oligonucleotide (MTpapdist; Table 1) was designed based on our previous work showing an increase in methylation efficiency when the WTpapdist flanks are changed to MTpapdist flanks (31Peterson S.N. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In vitro differentially methylated GATC sites on pBR322 were identified in previous work (28Bergerat A. Kriebardis A. Guschlbauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4064-4070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were designed based on those GATC sites and the native flanking DNA (8Julio S.M. Heithoff D.M. Provenzano D. Klose K.E. Sinsheimer R.L. Low D.A. Mahan M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7610-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Eberhard J. Oza J. Reich N.O. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 195: 223-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar bp from either end) found in pBR322 (A–I; Table 1). The eight phylogenetically conserved GATC sites located in the bacterial origin of replication were previously identified (21Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 489-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides were designed based on these GATC sites and the actual flanking DNA found in the E. coli genome (Table 1; 1Bestor T.H. Verdine G.L. Curr. Opin.

Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7610-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). GATC sites previously identified as undermethylated in vivo and located in the 5′-noncoding region of various genes within the E. coli genome were also used as templates for oligonucleotide design (18Tavazoie S. Church G.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Wang M.X. Church G.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These substrates were designed based on the actual GATC and flanking DNA sequences found in the E. coli genome and named according to the gene identified to be possibly impacted by the methylation state of that GATC (Table 1, mtl-yihU/V). Oligonucleotides used for systematic testing of flanking DNA sequences were based on the WTpapdist substrate and varied in both the rigidity of base pairs close to the GATC (Fig. 5A, R1–R4) and the distance of an A-tract to the GATC (Fig. 5A, D1–D3). Additionally, the mirror image of WTpapdist (R-WT-papdist; Fig. 5A) was designed and tested. All oligonucleotides mentioned above were annealed to their reverse complement by heating the 1:1 molar mixture for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by slow cooling (∼5 h) to room temperature. Duplex formation was verified by PAGE.TABLE 1Biologically derived DNA sequences used in this study Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5EcoDam is responsive to a directional A-tract flanking the target GATC site. A, sequence analysis of biologically derived GATC sites with a 7-fold or higher reduction in methyltransfer when compared with site H (WTpapdist, WTpapprox, car, and E). A-tracts directly adjacent to GATC site are highlighted in red. B, substrates were analyzed for methylation kinetics using the systematic movement of the A-tract away from the target GATC (D1, D2, and D3) and increasing amounts of rigidity close to the GATC (R1, R2, R3, and R4). The mirror image of WTpapdist (R-WTpapdist) was also tested. C, single-turnover analysis of control oligonucleotides seen in chart A reveal that an A-tract must be directly adjacent to the GATC site. Further, movement of the poly(A) portion of the A-tract to the 3′-end of the GATC showed a recovered rate of chemistry, indicating that the A-tract is directional.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) KDDNA Determination—Anisotropy experiments were performed on a Fluoromax-2 fluorimeter (ISA SPEX) equipped with an L-format autopolarizer at 22 °C. The change in anisotropy of 20 nm singly labeled (fluorescein) duplex DNA in MRB (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA) supplemented with 50 μm sinefungin was monitored as increasing enzyme was added. Data for each addition of enzyme were collected by monitoring the excitation at 494 nm and emission at 518 nm. Slit widths of 8 nm were used for all experiments. The resultant changes in anisotropy were plotted against enzyme concentration, and the dissociation constant was derived by fitting the data to the modified quadratic equation, f=(a+x+b)−(((a+x+b)2−4xa)1/2)2(Eq. 1) where b = KDDNA, x = [enzyme] × [DNA], and a = [enzyme-DNA]. All graphical analysis was done with Sigma Plot 6.1 (SSPS, Inc.). KMDNA and kcat Determination—Incorporation of tritiated methyl groups onto DNA was monitored by a filter binding assay, as previously described (33Mashhoon N. Carroll M. Pruss C. Eberhard J. Ishikawa S. Estabrook R.A. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52075-52081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). EcoDam was diluted in protein dilution buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). Reactions were carried out at 22 °C and contained 2 nm EcoDam in MRB, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 25 μm AdoMet, and DNA (0–500 nm) in a final volume of 20 μl. Mixtures were allowed to equilibrate at 22 °C prior to initiation with DNA. Reactions were quenched with 10 μl of 1% SDS at a single time point (30 min), and 25 μl was spotted onto 2.5-cm Whatman DE81 circular filter papers. Filter papers were washed three times in 50 mm KH2PO4, once in 80% ethanol, once in 100% ethanol, and once in diethyl ether for 5 min each. Papers were dried and submerged in BioSafeII scintillation fluid. Tritium levels were quantitated in a Beckman-Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter. Counts were converted to methylated product per unit time and plotted against the DNA concentration. Values for KMDNA and kcat were found by fitting the data to a rectangular hyperbola in Sigma Plot 6.1 (SSPS). kchem Determination—Single-turnover assays were done at 4 °C with limiting DNA. Reactions were carried out in MRB with 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 288 nm DNA, 420 nm EcoDam, and 30 μm AdoMet in a total volume of 100 μl. All reactions were initiated with the addition of DNA. At 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 300, and 600 s, 10-μl aliquots of the reaction were removed and quenched in 10 μl of 1% SDS. 15 μl of the resulting mixture was spotted on DE81 filter papers. Samples were washed, dried, and counted as described above. Counts were converted to nm methylated product and plotted against time. The kchem for each substrate was found by fitting the data to a single exponential in Sigma Plot 6.1. Competition Assay—Two substrates were designed and used for the competition assay. Both constructs contain the E and H GATC sites and their native flanking DNA described above on the same DNA substrate. The first construct with the sequence 5′-TAGCTCTTGATCCGGCAAACAGCTGTTCGCATCCTTTGATCTTTTCTACGCCTATGCC-3′ and its reverse complement was ordered and annealed as described above. The second construct consisted of the sequences 5′-AATTCTAGCTCTTGATCCGGCAAACACGAGGTCTCGAGCATCCTTTGATCTTTTCTACGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCGTAGAAAAGATCAAAGGATGCTCGAGACCTCGTGTTTGCCGGATCAAGAGCTAG-3′. When annealed, this duplex has overhangs complementary to the EcoRI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites. 5′-Phosphates were added to the duplex by incubating T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and ATP with the duplex at 37 °C for 2 h. T4 kinase was inactivated by heating the mixture to 65 °C for 20 min. The resulting duplex was cloned into pBR322 that had been linearized by EcoRI and HindIII. The resulting construct (pBREH) was analyzed by both restriction analysis and sequencing. A 270-bp construct was generated by PCR of pBREH containing the competition insert using the primers 5′-GGTTCCGCGCACATTTCCCCG-3′ and 5′-GGTGACGGTGCCGAGGATGACG-3′, respectively. PCR amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR clean-up kit (Qiagen) followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Concentrations of all DNA constructs were determined by measuring the A260. All competition assays were carried out at 22 °C with limiting enzyme. Methylation reactions were carried out in MRB supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml BSA and contained 10 nm EcoDam diluted into protein dilution buffer, 600 nm DNA, and 30 μm AdoMet. The reactions were quenched by removing aliquots from the reaction mixture into preheated TE at 75 °C and incubated for at least 15 min to ensure heat inactivation of EcoDam. After cooling to room temperature, samples were digested with DpnII for at least 12 h at 37 °C. A 10-bp ladder (Invitrogen), an uncut control, and the digested samples were run on a 12% (58-bp substrate) or 8% (270-bp substrate) native polyacrylamide gel for 4 h at 250 V. Gels were stained with Sybr Au (Invitrogen) and scanned on a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Band density was determined using ImageQuant version 1.2 (Molecular Dynamics Inc.) and further analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Density changes with time were finally plotted in Sigma Plot 6.1. The slopes of the linear fit to the formation of products that were methylated at both positions (νABC), methylated at only the preferred site (νAB), and methylated at only the nonpreferred site (νBC) were compared as previously described (34Jack W.E. Terry B.J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Stanford N.P. Szczelkun M.D. Marko J.F. Halford S.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6546-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The site preference for the preferred site (EP) over the nonpreferred site (EN-P) is described as follows. EP/EN-P=νAB/νBC(Eq. 2) These rates (νABC and νAB) are the only indication of the DNA being methylated at an individual site. Sequence Analysis—Multiple sequence alignment of substrates found to be preferentially methylated in single-turnover analyses (MTpapdist, A, B, C, D, G, H, I, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, mtl, cdd, flh, gut, yjdG, yidX, and yihU/V) was completed using ClustalX version 2.0 and the default parameters (36Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35395) Google Scholar). Semipreferred sites (F, 1, 2, fep, psp, and rsp) methylated 3–5-fold more slowly than preferred sites and nonpreferred sites showing an 8-fold or greater decrease in methylation kinetics (WTpapdist, WTpapprox, E, and car) were also aligned using the same method. Results were visualized using WebLogo version 2.8.2 (37Schneider T.D. Stephens R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6097-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar, 38Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8220) Google Scholar), where the height of each base within a stack is proportional to its frequency at that position. The sequence conservation is measured in bits; one bit measures the choice between equally likely possibilities (39Shannon C.E. Bell Syst. Tech. J. 1948; 27: 379-423Crossref Scopus (26679) Google Scholar). The most frequent base at each position is located on the top of the stack. Structural Analysis—Protein Data Bank file 2G1P containing the EcoDam/DNA co-crystal structure was downloaded from the RCSB data base and analyzed in PyMOL version 0.98 (DeLano Scientific). Residues within hydrogen bonding distance (≤3.0 Å) of the phosphate groups flanking the target GATC were displayed, and direct hydrogen bonds made from a side chain to the phosphate backbone were found by measuring the distances between atoms. Images were rendered and saved as .png files for use in Fig. 8. The pap System—Our original work on the importance of sequences flanking GATC sites was limited to the two poorly and nonprocessively methylated sites within the pap operon that control phase variation of pili expression in E. coli (31Peterson S.N. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our interest was to extend these initial studies to include GATC sites implicated in other important biological pathways. We first extended our original studies of the pap-related GATC sites to include the steady-state efficiency constant (kcat/KmDNA) (Fig. 1A). Observation of steady-state kinetic constants with low enzyme/substrate ratios more accurately represents the relatively few EcoDam molecules per GATC site within the cell (≤100) (40Lobnerolesen A. Boye E. Marinus M.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1841-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two 21-bp oligonucleotides containing the proximal and distal GATC sites, including the 8–9 base pairs naturally flanking the target sites (Table 1), were designed for these studies. Additionally, a 21-bp oligonucleotide was designed with flanks that were shown to increase EcoDam processivity on the WTpapdist substrate (MTpapdist; Table 1). The MTpapdist substrate varies from the WTpapdist substrate only in the three base pairs immediately adjacent to the GATC site. The similar kcat/KMDNA ratios for the WTpapdist and MTpapdist substrates result from a 3-fold increase in kcat for WTpapdist when compared with MTpapdist, which is compensated for by a 3-fold increase in the KMDNA (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, under steady-state conditions, there seems to be no apparent preference for one GATC site over another. EcoDam methylates GATC sites in a highly processive manner catalyzing multiple turnovers prior to dissociating from the DNA (41Urig S. Gowher H. Hermann A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because product release is rate-limiting under steady-state conditions and is dominating kcat, we included the pre-steady-state efficiency constant (kchem/KDDNA) for both the preferred and nonpreferred pap substrates (Fig. 1B). kchem is more relevant than kcat in the case of EcoDam, since it is highly unlikely that the enzyme will dissociate from the DNA prior to processively translocating to another GATC site. Thus, monitoring the kcat or product dissociation may not accurately predict preferential or nonpreferential methylation events. KDDNA and kchem determinations for each substrate best address the ability of EcoDam to both bind and catalyze the transfer of the methyl group on a particular DNA substrate. As previously observed by gel shift analysis (31Peterson S.N. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the WTpapdist and MTpapdist substrates showed no perturbation in DNA affinity under our anisotropy conditions (Fig. 1C). However, single-turnover analyses revealed an approximate 10-fold decrease in the rate of methylation"
https://openalex.org/W1989829809,"Activated coagulation factor V functions as a cofactor to factor Xa in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Based on the introduction of extra carbohydrate side chains in recombinant factor V, we recently proposed several regions in factor Va to be important for factor Xa binding. To further define which residues are important for factor Xa binding, we prepared fifteen recombinant factor V variants in which clusters of charged amino acid residues were mutated, mainly to alanines. The factor V variants were expressed in COS-1 cells, and their functional properties evaluated in a prothrombinase-based assay, as well as in a direct binding test. Four of the factor V variants, 501A/510A/511D, 501A/510A/511D/513A, 513A/577A/578A, and 501A/510A/511D/513A/577A/578A exhibited markedly reduced factor Xa-cofactor activity tested in the prothrombinase assay, and reduced binding affinity as judged by the direct binding assay. These factor Va variants were normally cleaved at Arg-506 by activated protein C, and the interaction between the factor Xa-factor Va complex and prothrombin was unaffected by the introduced mutations. Based on the integration of all available data, we propose a key factor Xa binding surface to be centered on Arg-501, Arg-510, Ala-511, Asp-513, Asp-577, and Asp-578 in the factor Va A2 domain. These residues form an elongated charged factor Xa binding cluster on the factor Va surface."

However, little is known about its functional regulation of p73, which has structural features similar to p53. In this study we found that TIP60 represses apoptosis, which is induced by exogenous and endogenous p73β. TIP60 also negatively regulated the expression of p73β downstream target genes such as p21 and Bax. Moreover, the specific repression of p73β-mediated transactivation by TIP60 was independent of p53 expression and not due to histone deacetylase recruiting transcriptional machinery. Transcriptional activities of both p73 splicing variants, p73α and p73β, were also repressed by TIP60. Furthermore, TIP60 markedly enhanced p73β binding affinity to MDM2 and physically associated with MDM2 through its zinc finger domain, which is specifically localized in the nucleus. Therefore, we demonstrate that TIP60 forms a ternary complex with p73β, which is directly bridged by MDM2. It is important to note that our findings contribute to a functional linkage between TIP60 and p73β through MDM2 in the transcriptional regulation of cellular apoptosis.

It is important to note that our findings contribute to a functional linkage between TIP60 and p73β through MDM2 in the transcriptional regulation of cellular apoptosis. p73 has significant sequence homology with p53, which provides similar structural features important for transcription factors (1Jost C.A.

Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Both p73 and p53 have an N-terminal transactivation domain, a central DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal oligomerization domain. Although p73 transcriptionally activates certain p53-responsive genes, which are closely related with cell cycle arrest and apoptotic responses (1Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), there are some functional differences between p73 and p53. For example, some viral oncoproteins including human Papillomavirus E6 and SV40 T-antigen do not interact with p73 even though they bind to p53 to inhibit its transcriptional activity (3Marin M.C.

Virol. 1999; 80: 3251-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The expression level of p73 is not affected by exposure to DNA-damaging agents such as ultraviolet irradiation, which efficiently increases p53 transcriptional activity (1Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p73 was known not only to be necessary for survival and long-term maintenance of central nervous system neurons including postnatal cortical neurons (5Pozniak C.D. Barnabe-Heider F. Rymar V.V. Lee A.F. Sadikot A.F. Miller F.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9800-9809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also to have an anti-apoptotic role during developmental neuron death (6Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). p73 is specifically activated by post-translational modifications including Chk1 phosphorylation (7Gonzalez S. Prives C.

Amphiphysin IIb-1 also inhibits p73 transactivation by sequestering nascent p73 proteins in the cytoplasm (14Kim K.C. Kim T.S. Kang K.H. Choi K.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Proteasome-dependent p73 degradation via ubiquitination is regulated by its interaction with Itch, which does not bind to p53 (15Oberst A. Rossi M. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Oren M. Melino G.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, the exact underlying mechanism associated with p73 regulation is not clear. TIP60 (HIV Tat-interacting protein, 60 kDa) was identified as an interaction partner for the HIV-1 Tat protein, which increases Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter (17Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The MYST (MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, SAS2, and TIP60) domain defines TIP60 as part of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) proteins that are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human (18Yang X.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 959-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). TIP60 functions as a transcriptional coactivator or corepressor depending upon the cellular context or the promoter site (19Sapountzi V. Logan I.R. Robson C.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1496-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For example, TIP60 associates with transcriptional activators such as HIV-1 Tat (17Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), type I nuclear hormone receptors (20Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E.

Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has also been implicated in the negative regulation of gene expression through binding to the transcriptional factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) or the transcriptional repressor ZEB (zinc finger E box-binding protein) (23Gavaravarapu S. Kamine J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Hlubek F. Lohberg C. Meiler J. Jung A. Kirchner T. Brabletz T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the role of TIP60 HAT activity in these processes remains to be elucidated. TIP60 was shown to act as a coactivator of p53-mediated transactivation. By interfering with MDM2-mediated p53 degradation through the formation of a ternary TIP60·MDM2·p53 complex (25Legube G. Linares L.K. Tyteca S. Caron C. Scheffner M. Chevillard-Briet M. Trouche D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44825-44833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), TIP60 increases p53 stability. The TIP60 transcriptional complex was also able to up-regulate p53-responsive genes including p21, GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 45), and MDM2 in response to DNA damage. Recently, it was also proposed that TIP60-dependent acetylation of p53 at Lys-120 plays a critical role for p53 activation to the apoptotic response (26Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 27Tang Y. Luo J. Zhang W. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, little is known about TIP60 functional regulation of p73 in cellular apoptotic responses. Therefore, we investigated the effects of TIP60 on p73 transcriptional activation using various human cell lines transiently transfected with a combination of knockdown or up-regulated expression plasmids of TIP60 and p73. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293), SK-OV-3, H1299, and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin (50 units/ml). SK-OV-3 and H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 2,3-Dichloro-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (NA) was provided by Dr. S. W. Ham at the Department of Chemistry at Chung-Ang University and dissolved in DMSO. Trichostatin A was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Transient transfection was performed by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with different plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—FLAG-TIP60 was a gift from S. H. Baek in the School of Biological Science at Seoul National University. The hTIP60 full-length coding region was amplified from hTIP60 cDNA in the human brain library (Clontech) using PCR and was introduced to pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), which was called pCRII-TOPO-TIP60. The hTIP60 clone was verified by DNA sequencing. TIP60 full-length (FL) was amplified from pCRII-TOPO-TIP60 using the PCR reaction: forward, 5′-GAA TTC ATG GCG GAG GTG GGG; reverse, 5′-TCT AGA TCA CCA CTT CCC CCT. TIP60-chromo, -Zn, and -HAT truncated mutants were amplified from TIP60-FL using PCR reaction; for TIP60-chromo, forward 5′-GAA TTC ATG GCG GAG GTG GGG-3′, reverse 5′-TCT AGA GAG GAC ATG TGT-3′; for TIP60-Zn, forward, 5′-GAA TTC ACC CCC ACT AAG AAC-3′, reverse, 5′-TCT AGA ATT GTA GTC TTC CGT-3′; for TIP60-HAT, forward, 5′-GAA TTC GTG GCC TGC ATC CTA-3′, reverse, 5′-TCT AGA TCA CCA CTT CCC CCT-3′. These PCR products were introduced into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and subcloned into the pCDNA-HA vector between EcoRI and XbaI and then verified by DNA sequencing. pCDNA-MDM2 and pCDNA3-HA-p73β have been described previously (28Jeong M.H.

Apoptosis Assays and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—To analyze cellular apoptosis, HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown to 60–70% confluence in complete media then transfected with plasmids encoding p73β in the presence or absence of a TIP60 expression plasmid. Apoptotic cells were identified by their rounded morphology compared with the spread-out morphology of non-apoptotic cells. The number of apoptotic cells was counted and presented as a percentage versus the total population of green fluorescence protein (GFP)-empty expressing cells. Chromatin condensation as an apoptotic marker was visualized by Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) staining. H1299 cells were transiently cotransfected with the expression plasmids for HA-p73β, pCDNA-MDM2, and FLAG-TIP60 with or without siRNA of p73 and shRNA of TIP60. Control transfection was performed with the empty plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were stained with trypan blue, and apoptotic cells in at least three different fields (more than 300 cells in one field) was measured. The apoptotic cells were additionally measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were re-washed with PBS and stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide and 5 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (51-65874X) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and BD Biosciences, respectively. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) for counting of apoptosis-positive cells. Luciferase Assay—HEK293, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes and transfected with the firefly luciferase p21 reporter gene (0.1 μg) and pCMV-β-galactosidase (0.1 μg) together with pcDNA-HA-p73β, pcDNA3-MDM2, and/or pEGFP-TIP60 using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h of transfection, cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cell extracts were analyzed with the luciferase reporter assay system using a Lumat LB 9501 Berthold Luminometer. Luciferase activities of the p21-luciferase vector were normalized based on β-galactosidase activity of the cotransfected vector. In Vivo Binding Assay and Western Blotting—HEK293, HeLa, and SK-OV3 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates at an initial density of 2 × 106 cells and allowed to grow for 12 h. The cells were transfected with the respective plasmids, further incubated for 24 h, and lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspensions were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation assays the supernatants were pre-cleaned with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose bead (50% slurry) and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 30 μl of fresh protein A/G bead in the presence of appropriate antibodies. The beads were washed three times in PBS, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using the appropriate antibodies to detect protein expression. The polyclonal antibody against the p73 protein generated from glutathione S-transferase-p73β was raised in the rabbit (29Kang K.H. Lee J.H. Kim K.C. Ham S.W. Kim M.Y. Choi K.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against TIP60 (sc-5725), MDM2 (sc-965), β-tubulin (sc-397), Bax (sc-493), and HA (sc-805) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against GFP (GFP-1814 460) and FLAG-M2 were purchased from Roche Diagnostics and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopic Detection—HeLa cells were grown on a sterile coverslip in 60-mm dishes and transfected with indicated expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and incubated with mouse anti-MDM2 antibody (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Plates were washed three times in PBS, and confocal imaging was performed with a Carl Zeiss LSM-510META laser scanning microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. For cell lysis 10% (v/v) of Nonidet P-40 was added, and the cells were vortexed for 10 s. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 s, the supernatant (cytosolic extracts) was transferred to a new tube. The pellet was added to ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (nuclear extracts) was transferred to new tubes and kept frozen at –70 °C until use. RNA Interference—To knock down endogenous p73 and TIP60, siRNA directed against human p73 (sc-36167, Santa Cruz) and shRNA for hTIP60 were introduced into H1299 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the expression levels of p73 and TIP60 by immunoblotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was performed following a protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). In brief, H1299 cells were treated with 20 μm NA. Twenty-four hours after NA treatment cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS-sample buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture. The suspension was sonicated 3 times for 10 s with a 1-min cooling period on ice and precleared with 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads blocked with sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were removed, and the chromatin solution of each experimental group was immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-p53, -p73, -MDM2, and -TIP60 antibodies at 4 °C followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3), and formaldehyde cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 6 h. Proteinase K was added to the reaction mixtures and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. DNA of the immunoprecipitates and control input DNA was purified using the phenol/chloroform extraction method and then analyzed by regular PCR using the human p21 promoter-specific primers. The primer sequences were 5′-CAC CTT TCA CCA TTC CCC TA-3′ and 5′-GCA GCC CAA GGA CAA AAT AG-3′ for p21. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of variances between two different experimental groups was performed with Tukey's post hoc comparison test using SPSS (Version 11.5). All experiments were repeated at least three times. The levels are considered significant for p < 0.05 (shown as a single asterisk), very significant for p < 0.01 (shown as double asterisks), obviously significant for p < 0.001 (shown as triple asterisks), and not significant (n.s.). p73β-induced Apoptotic Cell Death Is Inhibited by TIP60—TIP60 was controversially reported to be a transcriptional co-activator (20Brady M.E.

Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) and a co-repressor for certain transcriptional regulators (23Gavaravarapu S. Kamine J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Xiao H. Chung J. Kao H.Y. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined apoptotic patterns of HEK293 cells after transient co-transfection with p73β and TIP60 expression plasmids to investigate how TIP60 regulates p73β-mediated apoptosis. Apoptotic rate was assessed by counting the morphologically round and shrunken p73β-transfected cells in the absence or presence of TIP60. As indicated in Fig. 1A, p73β-induced apoptosis was significantly blocked by TIP60 in a dose-dependent manner. The chromatin-condensed pattern of p73β-induced apoptotic cells, which was visualized by Hoechst 33258 staining, was markedly decreased in the presence of TIP60 (Fig. 1B). Because endogenous p73β induced by a naphthoquinone analog (NA) was reported to augment cellular apoptotic responses (29Kang K.H. Lee J.H. Kim K.C. Ham S.W. Kim M.Y. Choi K.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we next determined the effects of TIP60 on endogenous p73β-induced apoptosis. After TIP60-transfected HeLa cells and their controls were treated with 20 μm NA, their apoptotic patterns were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). The annexin-V-stained portion, which represents an apoptotic pattern, was significantly increased to 37.4% in NA-treated HeLa cells compared with 11% in control cells. In contrast, TIP60-transfected cells showed 22.92% of the apoptotic ratio at the same experimental condition (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate that TIP60 represses increased apoptosis, which is induced by exogenous and endogenous p73β. TIP60 Reduces the Expression Level of Apoptotic Signaling Proteins Such as p21 and Bax, Which Are Induced by p73β—Because p73β induces cellular apoptosis by activating its downstream target proteins such as p21 and Bax (31Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined the expression level of p21 and Bax by Western blot analysis using HEK293 cells co-transfected with HA-p73β and GFP-TIP60 expression plasmids. As indicated in Fig. 2A, the enhanced expression level of p21 and Bax by p73β overexpression was significantly reduced by TIP60. We next examined the effects of TIP60 on the expression of p21 and Bax, which was enhanced by NA-induced endogenous p73β in p53 null H1299 cells. TIP60 also significantly reduced the expression level of p21 and Bax enhanced by endogenous p73β in H1299 cells (Fig. 2B, lane 3) and HeLa cells (supplemental Figs. S1, lane 3). In addition, p73 siRNA did markedly inhibit Bax and p21 expression induced by NA treatment (Fig. 2B, lane 4), suggesting that TIP60 represses Bax and p21 expression, which are specifically modulated through the p73-related pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that TIP60 negatively regulates the expression of p73β downstream target proteins such as p21 and Bax in a p53-independent manner. p73β Transcriptional Activity Is Repressed by TIP60—Because TIP60 reduces p73β-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting p73-downstream target genes, we investigated the effects of TIP60 on p73β transcriptional activity using HEK293, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cell lines, which were transiently co-transfected with a p73β expression plasmid plus a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the p73-responsive element from the p21 promoter. As indicated in Fig. 3A, enhanced luciferase activities of the three cell lines by p73β transactivation were significantly repressed by TIP60 in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that p73β-mediated transactivation is specifically inhibited by TIP60 in various cell lines independent of p53 expression. TIP60 Represses Transactivation of p73 but Not of p53—The p73 gene encodes at least two different proteins, termed p73α and p73β, that differ exclusively at their C-terminal portions due to an alternative splicing event (32Coates P.J. J. Pathol. 2006; 210: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine whether TIP60 can regulate transactivation of p53 and p73 splice variants such as p73α and p73β, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with combined expression plasmids of HA-p73α, HA-p73β, and HA-p53 along with a GFP-tagged TIP60 expression vector as indicated in Fig. 3B. In the presence of TIP60, transcriptional activities of both p73 variants were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner; however, p53 transactivation was increased with TIP60 expression compared with its control (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TIP60 can repress transcriptional activity of both p73 splicing variants, p73α and p73β, but not that of p53. TIP60 Does Not Recruit Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) to Repress p73β Transactivation—Recent studies have suggested that TIP60 acts either as a co-activator or a co-repressor to modulate transcriptional activities by associating with various transcriptional regulators. For example, TIP60 has been implicated in the negative regulation of interleukin-9-induced c-myc expression through STAT3 repression, which was associated with the recruitment of HDAC7 by TIP60 (30Xiao H. Chung J. Kao H.Y. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether TIP60 represses p73β transactivation through cooperation with HDACs. First, we incubated HEK293 cells co-transfected with p73β and TIP60 in culture media containing trichostatin A (an inhibitor of class I and II histone deacetylases) for 12 h. As indicated in Fig. 4, TIP60 repression of enhanced luciferase activities by p73β transactivation was not recovered by 1 or 5 μm trichostatin A treatment. These results indicate that TIP60 does not require HDAC activity to repress p73β transactivation. Interaction between p73β and TIP60 Is Mediated by MDM2—It has recently been reported that TIP60 interferes with MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 to maintain a basal pool of p53 under normal growth conditions (25Legube G. Linares L.K. Tyteca S. Caron C. Scheffner M. Chevillard-Briet M. Trouche D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44825-44833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). MDM2 was also reported to physically interact with TIP60 and induce its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation (33Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated possible MDM2 regulation in TIP60 repression of p73β transactivation. After HEK293 cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged p73β and GFP-fused TIP60 expression plasmids along with an MDM2 expression vector, the whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting using specific anti-HA and anti-GFP antibodies to determine p73β and TIP60, respectively (Fig. 5A). In the presence of MDM2, the amount of p73β proteins co-immunoprecipitated with TIP60 (Fig. 5A, lane 3) was significantly increased compared with that in the absence of MDM2 (Fig. 5A, lane 2). HEK293 cells transfected with p73β alone served as a negative control (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Likewise, p53-null SK-OV3 co-transfected with HA-tagged p73β and FLAG-tagged TIP60 expression plasmids in the presence of MDM2 showed the pattern of co-immunoprecipitated p73β and TIP60 (Fig. 5B, lane 2) in comparison to the absence of MDM2 (Fig. 5B, lane 1). The total amounts of p73β and TIP60 in whole cell lysates were almost equal in both experimental conditions (bottom in Fig. 5, A and B). Taken together, these results indicate that the interaction of TIP60 with p73β is physically mediated by MDM2. MDM2 Is a Bridge of Complex Formation between TIP60 and p73β—To further confirm the MDM2-mediated physical interaction between p73β and TIP60, we investigated the effect of MDM2 immunodepletion in HeLa cells co-transfected with TIP60 and p73β expression plasmids with or without the MDM2 expression plasmid. When MDM2 proteins were immunodepleted with 0.2–0.8 μg of anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibodies using protein agarose A/G beads from HeLa whole cell lysates, the level of MDM2 proteins was determi"
