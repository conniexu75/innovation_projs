https://openalex.org/W2071587854,"Familial male precocious puberty (FMPP) is a gonadotropin-independent disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant, male-limited pattern. Affected males generally exhibit signs of puberty by age 4. Testosterone production and Leydig cell hyperplasia occur in the context of prepubertal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH). The LH receptor is a member of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors, and we hypothesized that FMPP might be due to a mutant receptor that is activated in the presence of little or no agonist. A single A-->G base change that results in substitution of glycine for aspartate at position 578 in the sixth transmembrane helix of the LH receptor was found in affected individuals from eight different families. Linkage of the mutation to FMPP was supported by restriction-digest analysis. COS-7 cells expressing the mutant LH receptor exhibited markedly increased cyclic AMP production in the absence of agonist, suggesting that autonomous Leydig cell activity in FMPP is caused by a constitutively activated LH receptor."

The normal function of the FMR1 protein (FMRP) and the mechanism by which its absence leads to mental retardation are unknown. Ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) domains were identified within FMRP, and RNA was shown to bind in stoichiometric ratios, which suggests that there are two RNA binding sites per FMRP molecule. FMRP was able to bind to its own message with high affinity (dissociation constant = 5.7 nM) and interacted with approximately 4 percent of human fetal brain messages. The absence of the normal interaction of FMRP with a subset of RNA molecules might result in the pleiotropic phenotype associated with fragile X syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2080780289,"The adhesive interactions between leukocyte L-selectin and the endothelium are involved in the migration of lymphocytes through peripheral lymph nodes and of neutrophils to sites of inflammation. A recombinant L-selectin stains high endothelial venules (HEVs) in lymph nodes and recognizes sulfated carbohydrates found on two endothelial glycoproteins, Sgp50 and Sgp90. Amino acid sequencing of purified Sgp90 revealed a protein core identical to that CD34, a sialomucin expressed on hematopoietic stem cells and endothelium. A polyclonal antiserum to recombinant murine CD34 stains peripheral lymph node endothelium and recognizes Sgp90 that is functionally bound by L-selectin. Thus, an HEV glycoform of CD34 can function as a ligand for L-selectin."
https://openalex.org/W1558643874,"The cytokine-induced nitric oxide synthase (NOS) of macrophages is a homodimeric enzyme that contains iron protoporphorin IX (heme), FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin, and calmodulin. To investigate how the enzyme's quaternary structure relates to its catalytic activity and binding of prosthetic groups, dimeric NOS and its subunits were purified separately and their composition and catalytic properties compared. In contrast to dimeric NOS, purified subunits did not synthesize NO or contain bound heme or tetrahydrobiopterin. However, the subunits did contain FAD, FMN, and calmodulin in amounts comparable with dimeric NOS, displayed the light absorbance spectrum of an FAD- and FMN-containing flavoprotein, and generated an air-stable flavin semiquinone radical upon reduction of their ferricyanide-oxidized form. Dimeric NOS and NOS subunits were equivalent in catalyzing electron transfer from NADPH to cytochrome c, dichlorophenolindophenol, or ferricyanide at rates that were 8-30-fold faster than the maximal rate of NO synthesis by dimeric NOS. Reconstitution of subunit NO synthesis required their incubation with L-arginine, tetrahydrobiopterin, and stoichiometric amounts of heme and correlated with formation of a proportional amount of dimeric NOS in all cases. The dimeric NOS reconstituted from its subunits contained 0.9 heme and 0.44 tetrahydrobiopterin bound per subunit and had the spectral and catalytic properties of native dimeric NOS. Thus, NOS subunits are NADPH-dependent reductases that acquire the capacity to synthesize NO only through their dimerization and binding of heme and tetrahydrobiopterin. The ability of heme, tetrahydrobiopterin, and L-arginine to promote subunit dimerization is unprecedented and suggests novel roles for these molecules in forming and stabilizing the active dimeric NOS."
https://openalex.org/W1677528798,"Deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most prevalent mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF). This mutation (delta F508CFTR) leads to a reduced cAMP-sensitive Cl- conductance in epithelial cells. While the mutant protein can function as a Cl- channel, it seems to be misprocessed and unable to accumulate at normal levels in the plasma membrane. Under conditions where the biosynthetic block of delta F508CFTR is not complete, the residence time of delta F508CFTR in the plasma membrane is a critical determinant of the cAMP-sensitive Cl- conductance. To assess the stability of the mutant and wild-type CFTR, we compared their functional half-lives at the plasma membrane of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. The plasma membrane Cl- conductance was assessed by patch-clamp recordings and/or by fluorimetric determinations of the membrane potential. Accumulation of delta F508CFTR in the plasma membrane was promoted by growing the transfected cells at reduced temperature (24-28 degrees C), and was verified by immunoblotting and by detecting the appearance of a plasmalemmal cAMP-activated Cl- conductance. Subsequently increasing the temperature to 37 degrees C inhibited further delivery of newly synthesized delta F508CFTR to the surface membrane. By studying the time dependence of the disappearance of the Cl- conductance, the functional half-life of the mutant protein at the plasma membrane was determined to be 24 h). The latter was estimated by terminating protein synthesis or secretion with cycloheximide or brefeldin A, respectively. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not alter the rate of disappearance of delta F508CFTR at 37 degrees C, validating the difference in turnover between mutant and wild-type CFTR. These results indicate that the structural abnormality of delta F508CFTR affects not only the delivery of the protein to the plasma membrane, but also its stability therein. Moreover, they suggest that overcoming the processing block at the endoplasmic reticulum may not suffice to restore normal Cl- conductance in CF."
https://openalex.org/W1487858339,"Increasing evidence indicates that the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors can transduce biochemical signals from the extracellular matrix to the cell interior to modulate cell behavior. We have investigated the role of protein kinase C in alpha 5 beta 1 integrin-mediated signal transduction in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Up-regulation of protein kinase C activity by phorbol esters was found to enhance cell adhesion, spreading, and migration on a fibronectin substrate, without affecting the cell surface expression or fibronectin binding of the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin, whereas inhibition of protein kinase C activity by calphostin C inhibited these functions as well in unstimulated cells. In addition, we observed that protein kinase C activity in the cell membrane fraction transiently increases preceding cell spreading on fibronectin, but not on polylysine, additionally implying a specific role of protein kinase C in alpha 5 beta 1 integrin-mediated spreading on fibronectin. Experiments with phorbol esters and calphostin C also suggested that protein kinase C activity is required for enhanced phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, pp125fak, in cells plated on fibronectin. Protein kinase C-alpha was not, however, found to directly act on pp125fak, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in this phenomenon."

https://openalex.org/W2117377079,"Abstract Much progress has been made in elucidating early events in signal transduction by growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Upon ligand addition, these receptors dimerize and activate, becoming phosphorylated at a number of tyrosyl residues. These phosphorylation sites serve as docking points for proteins containing src homology-2 (SH2) domains. However, little is known about how phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), participate in these events. Recently, we and others molecularly cloned a ubiquitously expressed SH2 domain-containing PTP, SH-PTP2 (Syp, PTP1D, PTP2C), and found that it interacts directly with several activated growth factor receptors via its SH2 domains. Using a peptide competition assay, we now demonstrate that the major binding site for SH-PTP2 on the platelet-derived growth factor receptor is phosphotyrosine 1009. Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that SH-PTP2 is the previously unidentified 64-kDa protein known to bind at this site. Addition of a phosphotyrosyl peptide comprising the region around Tyr-1009 stimulates SH-PTP2 activity 5-10-fold, whereas other phosphotyrosyl peptides from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor have no stimulatory effect. Our data suggest that binding of SH-PTP2 to the activated receptor in vivo should result in stimulation of SH-PTP2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1962628502,"The actin cross-linking protein alpha-actinin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the beta 1 subunit of integrin, suggesting that alpha-actinin may form a direct link between the actin cytoskeleton and the transmembrane fibronectin receptor. In this study, we have used short synthetic peptides to localize the binding site for alpha-actinin within the cytoplasmic domain of beta 1 integrin. Four 13-residue peptides were tested in both an affinity chromatographic assay and a solid-phase binding assay. The results indicated that two regions of sequence contribute to the binding of alpha-actinin: one near where the beta 1 cytoplasmic tail emerges from the membrane and a second segment located near the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail. This binding pattern was investigated in more detail using an adaptation of the mimotope assay, in which each of the 32 overlapping sequential decapeptide segments from the beta 1 cytoplasmic domain was assembled on the head of a different plastic pin. The peptide-pin constructs were used to detect the binding of 125I-alpha-actinin. As predicted from our initial results, alpha-actinin was found to bind to two distinct clusters of peptide segments. This represents a novel use of the mimotope pin assay to map interactive sites on structural proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1577145787,"The identification and characterization of proteins that become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to growth factor stimulation is critical to furthering our understanding of the signal transduction pathways involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. In this report we demonstrate that interleukin-3, erythropoietin, and steel factor all induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of the SH2 containing protein, p52shc. These studies were carried out with various human and murine cell lines to document that this is a common event in hemopoietic cells. We also show that upon tyrosine phosphorylation, p52shc becomes associated with the adaptor protein, Grb2. The formation of this complex may directly link tyrosine phosphorylation events to Ras activation in hemopoietic progenitors and may be a critical step in stimulating these cells to transit through G1 into S phase."

https://openalex.org/W1985231117,"When the recognition sequence of a ribozyme is extended beyond a certain length, turnover is slowed and specificity is decreased. Here, it is shown that a protein can help a ribozyme overcome these general limitations on ribozyme activity. Cleavage of an RNA oligonucleotide by a hammerhead ribozyme is enhanced 10- to 20-fold upon addition of a protein derived from the p7 nucleocapsid (NC) protein of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1. The NC protein also enhances the ability of the ribozyme to discriminate between cleavage of RNA oligonucleotides with differing sequences. These catalytic improvements can be attributed to the strand exchange activity of this RNA binding protein. It is conceivable that endogenous or added proteins may provide analogous increases in ribozyme activity and specificity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1619700982,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) is a large cell surface receptor consisting of a 515-kDa heavy chain and an 85-kDa light chain proteolytically derived from a 600-kDa precursor. Previous work has shown that LRP is responsible for mediating the internalization of urinary-type plasminogen activator (uPA) complexed to plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) (Nykjaer et al., 1992; Herz et al., 1992). The current study indicates that pro-urokinase (pro-uPA) and two chain urokinase (tc-uPA) bind directly to purified LRP, and that LRP mediates their internalization and degradation in Hep G2 cells. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that pro-uPA and tc-uPA bind to purified LRP with affinities (Kd = 45 and 60 nM, respectively) that are approximately 15 to 20-fold weaker than the affinity of uPA.PAI-1 complex for LRP (Kd = 3 nM). Competitive binding experiments revealed that pro-uPA and tc-uPA completely inhibit binding of uPA.PAI-1 complexes to purified LRP. The binding of 125I-pro-uPA to LRP is blocked by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, but not by an amino-terminal fragment of uPA, which is known to block binding of uPA to the urokinase receptor. 125I-Pro-uPA can be internalized and degraded by Hep G2 cells independent of PAI-1. Both the internalization and degradation are completely blocked by receptor-associated protein or affinity-purified LRP antibodies, indicating that LRP is mediating this process. These processes are also blocked by the amino-terminal fragment, which suggests that the favored pathway for uPA metabolism is initial binding to the urokinase receptor, followed by ligand transfer to LRP, then internalization leading to degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1576493498,"Transforming growth factors beta (TGF-beta s) are disulfide-linked dimers. In Rat-1 cells both radioiodinated TGF-beta 1 and -beta 2 bind to and can be chemically cross-linked to type I and II receptors (which are thought to mediate effects of cell growth suppression and gene activation), to type III proteoglycan receptors, and to a novel approximately 50-kDa protein. After detergent solubilization of cells that were cross-linked with radioiodinated TGF-beta, antibodies specific for the type II receptor precipitated labeled receptor types I and III as well as type II. In these cells, the type III receptor is the predominant TGF-beta-binding protein, and antibodies specific for it precipitate mainly this cross-linked receptor. Thus, in the presence of TGF-beta ligand, receptor types II and III and types II and I form heteromeric complexes. The majority of the type III receptor does not associate with receptor types I and II, probably reflecting the relative amounts of the three receptors on the surface of Rat-1 cells. Since TGF-beta 1 but not TGF-beta 2 binds to the exoplasmic domain of the type II receptor in the absence of the type III receptor, and since both TGF-beta 1 and -beta 2 bind with high affinity to the type III receptor, we suggest that TGF-beta 2, and possibly TGF-beta 1, bind initially to the type III receptor. The TGF-beta 2-type III receptor complex would then interact with a type II receptor, thus modulating the affinity of the type II receptor for TGF-beta 2."
https://openalex.org/W1558930301,"The alpha 5 beta 1 integrin mediates cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin, a glycoprotein critical for normal vertebrate embryonic development. Indirect evidence reported to date suggests that this receptor also functions in the deposition of fibronectin matrices. We used a molecular genetic approach to critically evaluate this role of alpha 5 beta 1 integrins. Mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells deficient in alpha 5 integrin expression could not assemble a fibronectin matrix. Reconstituting alpha 5 beta 1 integrin expression by transfecting them with a full-length cDNA encoding the human alpha 5 chain completely restored fibronectin matrix assembly. CHO cells expressing an alpha 5 chain lacking the cytoplasmic domain also assembled a fibronectin matrix. Removing the cytoplasmic domain of alpha 5 appears to increase its activity in fibronectin matrix assembly. In addition to alpha 5 beta 1 integrin binding to fibronectin's RGD-containing domain, cells must bind with high affinity to fibronectin's amino-terminal 29-kDa matrix assembly domain to form a fibronectin matrix. Studies with the alpha 5-deficient CHO cells show that the expression of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin is also necessary for cells to bind fragments containing this distinct site in fibronectin and that a fibronectin matrix increases binding of the 29-kDa fragment. Thus, alpha 5 beta 1 integrins not only mediate cell adhesion to fibronectin, but also play an essential role in the assembly of a fibronectin matrix. This role includes direct binding to fibronectin and modulating a distinct binding event involving the interaction of fibronectin's amino-terminal matrix assembly domain with the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1588915448,"Cardiovascular collapse associated with Gram-negative septicemia is believed to result from the stimulation of phagocytes by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, LPS). It remains unclear how endotoxin activates phagocytes, but recent evidence suggests the involvement of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked myelocyte antigen, CD14. We report that transfection of human CD14 into Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts transfers macrophage-like responsiveness to otherwise LPS-unresponsive cells. These data demonstrate that LPS-induced responsiveness can be transferred to a heterologous non-responder cell type by expression of a single leukocyte-specific gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1505258801,"The binding of fibrinogen to membrane glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa on activated platelets leads to platelet aggregation. This interaction results in conformational changes in fibrinogen as evidenced by the expression of receptor-induced binding sites, RIBS, epitopes which are expressed by the bound but not the free ligand. In the present study, two RIBS epitopes have been localized. One sequence resides at gamma 112-119 and is recognized by mAb 9F9; the second is the RGDF sequence at A alpha 95-98 and is recognized by mAb 155B16. These epitopes are also exposed by adsorption of fibrinogen onto a plastic surface and digestion of the molecule by plasmin. Proteolytic exposure of the epitopes coincides with cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal aspects of the A alpha-chains to form fragment X2. The inaccessibility of the RGDF sequence at A alpha 95-98 in fibrinogen suggests that this sequence does not participate in the initial binding of the molecule to GPIIb-IIIa. The location of these RIBS epitopes suggests a model in which binding of fibrinogen to its receptor alters the conformation of the carboxyl-terminal aspects of the A alpha-chains, exposing the sequences which reside in the coiled-coil connector segments between the D and E domains of the molecule. These sequences may then serve as epitopes and may mediate unique functions of the receptor-bound molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1507060386,"The effects of the membrane-impermeable fluorescent sulfhydryl reagent eosin 5-maleimide (EMA) and the membrane-permeable sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) on ADP transport via the ADP/ATP carrier and their labeling sites in the carrier were studied in bovine heart submitochondrial particles. Of the 4 cysteine residues in the carrier, EMA labeled Cys159 very rapidly, Cys56 slowly, and Cys256 very slowly and did not label Cys128. Its labeling of Cys159 was associated with inhibition of the ADP transport, suggesting that the peptide segment containing Cys159 is involved in the transport of adenine nucleotides. In contrast to the very rapid binding of EMA to Cys159, NEM bound to Cys56 more slowly and labeled Cys159 and Cys256 much more slowly. Like EMA, it did not react with Cys128. The labeling of Cys56 with NEM also inhibited ADP transport. From these results, the locations of these cysteine residues in the ADP/ATP carrier are discussed in relation to the transport of adenine nucleotides mediated by the ADP/ATP carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1480844331,"We present evidence that the CD19 receptor is functionally operative and transmits pleiotropic signals throughout the pro-B, pre-pre-B, pre-B, early B, and mature B cell stages of human B-cell ontogeny. The signaling ability of CD19 does not depend on the existence of a functional B-cell antigen receptor complex (ARC). In B-cell precursors (BCP) lacking a functional ARC, CD19 is physically and functionally associated with Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTK). The engagement of the CD19 receptor on BCP with a high affinity anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or its homoconjugate rapidly activates the associated PTK and results in tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19. Moreover, this proximal PTK activation step triggers downstream stimulation of several different intracellular messenger systems. Remarkably, CD19 becomes rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon engagement of several other surface receptors as well, suggesting that it may function as a common response element linked via tyrosine phosphorylation to multiple BCP/B-cell receptors and signaling pathways. Furthermore, in all B-lineage lymphoid cell populations, co-approximation of the receptors CD19 and CD72 (ligand for the CD5 T-cell receptor) generates a stronger signal than the engagement of either individual receptor. These convergent observations constitute a strong argument for an important regulatory function of CD19 in human BCP and prompt the hypothesis that the CD19 receptor may play an important role in cognate interactions between B- and T-lineage lymphoid compartments as well as the coordinate production of BCP at multiple stages of human B-cell ontogeny."
https://openalex.org/W1574744729,"The binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors triggers the opening of an anion-selective channel. To identify amino acid residues that line the channel, we combined cysteine mutagenesis and covalent chemical modification. We mutated, one at a time, four consecutive residues (268-271) in the M2 membrane-spanning segment of the rat GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit to cysteine and expressed the mutant alpha 1 subunits, together with either the beta 1 subunit or the beta 1 and gamma 2 subunits, in Xenopus oocytes. We probed the susceptibility of the cysteine substitution mutants to covalent modification by charged, sulfhydryl reagents added extracellularly. We assumed that among the residues in membrane-spanning segments, only those lining the channel would be susceptible to modification by polar reagents and that such modification would irreversibly alter conduction. We infer that the residues Thr-268 and Ile-271 are exposed in the channel in both the open and closed states but that Leu-269 and Ser-270 are not exposed. The susceptibility of Thr-268 and Ile-271 in the closed state implies that the gate must be closer to the cytoplasmic end of the channel than Thr-268."
https://openalex.org/W1493605323,"Nitric oxide (NO), recently found to play many physiological roles, is generated by the catalysis of L-arginine and O2 to L-citrulline and NO by nitric oxide synthases (NOSs). Resonance Raman spectra from the heme of resting, reduced, and CO-bound forms of rat brain NOS firmly establish that the enzyme belongs to the P-450 class of enzymes. The electron density marker line (V4) in the Raman spectrum of ligand-free ferrous NOS has a low frequency (1347 cm-1), indicating a thiolate axial ligand on the heme. The assignment of a thiolate axial ligand is confirmed in the CO-bound form of the enzyme by the frequency of the Fe-C-O bending mode at 562 cm-1. The heme is resting NOS is five-coordinate high spin and thereby differs from the resting state of most substrate-free P-450s, which are predominantly six-coordinate low spin. The frequency of the Fe-CO stretching mode in the CO-bound enzyme at 491 cm-1, identified by isotope substitution, in higher than that in substrate-free P-450s. Thus, in the ferric and the CO-bound forms of the enzyme, the sixth-ligand binding site on the heme is restricted by steric or hydrophobic interactions. In addition, the Fe-CO stretching mode is broad (30 cm-1) and may be resolved into two overlapping lines of equal intensity, indicating that the heme domains can adopt two distinct conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2056132501,"Electrophysiology and structural studies were performed on an annexin V variant containing a mutation of glutamic acid-95 to serine in the center of the pore region. The mutation resulted in a lower single channel conductance for calcium and a strongly increased conductance for sodium and potassium, indicating that glutamic acid-95 is a crucial constituent of the ion selectivity filter. There were only minor differences in the crystal structures of mutant and wild-type annexin V around the mutation site; however, the mutant showed structural differences elsewhere, including the presence of a calcium binding site in domain III unrelated to the mutation. Analysis of the membrane-bound form of annexin V by electron microscopy revealed no differences between the wild type and mutant."

Recombinant dU2AF50 protein complements mammalian splicing extracts depleted of U2AF activity. Germline transformation of Drosophila with the dU2AF50 complementary DNA rescues a lethal mutation, establishing that the dU2AF50 gene is essential for viability.

Here, we report that the cytosolic (mot-1) and the perinuclear (mot-2) forms of mortalin cDNA cloned from mortal and immortal cells, respectively, differ by only two bases in the open reading frame, resulting in two amino acid changes. The induced expression of the cytosolic form by transfection of mot-1 cDNA (isolate from CD1-ICR mouse embryonic fibroblasts) to NIH 3T3 cells induced cellular senescence. However, the perinuclear form expressed by mot-2 cDNA (isolate from NIH 3T3 cells) did not yield an equivalent effect. The data suggest the senescence-inductive function of cytosolic mortalin and implicitly point to a genetic event involved in immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W1563229810,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/alpha 2MR) binds and internalizes several plasma proteins including tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and alpha 2-macroglobulin-protease complexes (alpha 2M*). A 39-kDa protein that copurifies with LRP/alpha 2MR inhibits the binding and uptake of ligands by LRP/alpha 2MR, including t-PA and alpha 2M*. To define domains on the 39-kDa protein which are essential for inhibition of t-PA and alpha 2M* binding to LRP/alpha 2MR, we have generated bacterial expression constructs encoding discrete regions of the 39-kDa protein as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase. Inhibition of t-PA and alpha 2M* binding to LRP/alpha 2MR on rat hepatoma MH1C1 cells are shown to require amino acid residues 18-24 and 100-107 on the 39-kDa protein. Inhibition of t-PA but not alpha 2M* binding to LRP/alpha 2MR is also mediated by residues 200-225 and 311-319. The same 39-kDa protein constructs that inhibit alpha 2M* and t-PA binding to MH1C1 cells are able to bind directly to purified LRP/alpha 2MR immobilized on nitrocellulose. Thus, our studies demonstrate several specific regions on the 39-kDa protein which are required for the inhibition of t-PA and alpha 2M* binding to LRP/alpha 2MR."
https://openalex.org/W1483115830,"The egg peptide speract activates sperm K channels by transient stimulation of guanylyl cyclase (see the accompanying paper, Cook, S.P., and Babcock, D.F. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22402-22407). Behavioral responses to speract are thought to require the brief elevations of cAMP and cytosolic [Ca2+] (Cai) also evoked by speract through yet unknown mechanisms. Here we present evidence that cAMP mediates activation of a putative, Mn(2+)-permeable Ca channel that is responsible for increased Cai. We find that: 1) prolonged elevation of Cai was produced by treatments previously shown to selectively enhance accumulation of cAMP; 2) elevation of Cai and entry of Mn2+ are prevented by those manipulations of external [Na+] and [K+] previously shown to prevent accumulation of cAMP; 3) the blockade to Ca2+ entry imposed by increased external K+ is bypassed by elevation of cytosolic pH (pHi) with NH4Cl; 4) in the absence of speract, NH4Cl allows Mn2+ entry that is enhanced by papaverine, an inhibitor of sperm cAMP phosphodiesterase. These results thus also suggest that elevation of pHi is both necessary and sufficient to activate adenylylcyclase. This study provides tentative identification of sperm Ca channels as downstream targets of cAMP action and indicates that pHi may determine whether cGMP- or cAMP-mediated second messenger pathways predominate in speract signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1491326847,"Eight agents that increase the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP were tested for their effect on edema formation. The specificity of the agents for vascular smooth muscle or the endothelium was determined by measuring vasodilation with a laser Doppler flow probe and cAMP production by endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. The agents were injected intradermally in anesthetized rabbit skin and the local accumulation of 125I-labeled albumin in response to intradermal bradykinin was measured. Il-oprost, prostaglandin E1, prostaglandin E2, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) potentiated bradykinin-induced edema. These same agents also increased blood flow and vascular smooth muscle cAMP concentrations, but did not increase endothelial cell cAMP production. Albuterol suppressed edema formation, did not cause vasodilation, but did increase endothelial cell cAMP concentrations. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram did not cause vasodilation, but suppressed edema and potentiated the cAMP response to albuterol in cultured endothelial cells. l-Isoproterenol affected both cell types. At a lower concentration l-isoproterenol was a potent stimulus to endothelial cell cAMP production and inhibited edema formation; a higher dose had additional effects on vascular smooth muscle and significantly increased blood flow. These findings support the hypothesis that increasing intracellular cAMP concentrations in vascular smooth muscle promotes edema via increased blood flow. In contrast, increasing cAMP concentrations in endothelium may suppress edema by enhancing the permeability barrier.—Warren, J. B., Wilson, A. J., Loi, R. K., Coughlan, M. L.

https://openalex.org/W1481685907,"The egg peptide speract stimulates sperm guanylyl cyclase and presumably enhances fertilization, but the roles of cGMP in sperm responses are yet undetermined. Here we show that speract-induced accumulation of cGMP or cAMP is selectively enhanced by the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) or papaverine, respectively. These inhibitors provided the unusual opportunity to examine the consequences of manipulating cGMP- and cAMP-dependent responses. The following observations suggest that cGMP mediates activation of K channels, the earliest known ionic event in speract signal transduction: 1) both cGMP content and K+ permeability are maximal within 15 s of speract stimulation and both decline after intracellular pH (pHi) increases in response to hyperpolarization; 2) IBMX prolongs elevation of cGMP and sustains K+ permeability after pHi increases; 3) both cGMP accumulation and K+ permeability also are enhanced when the pHi increase is prevented by an elevated concentration of external K+ (Ko); 4) elevating pHi with NH4Cl bypasses the blockade imposed by high Ko and decreases K+ permeability. Because IBMX antagonizes this action of NH4Cl, these results further suggest that elevation of pHi initiates an inactivation of guanylyl cyclase that leads to K channel closure. However, K+ permeability is restored upon subsequent elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] (Cai), indicating either that sperm K channels possess an alternate regulatory mode, or that a distinct Ca(2+)-activated K permeability also participates in speract signal transduction. Regardless of the mechanism that mediates Cai action, sperm K channels are identified as downstream targets of cGMP and are implicated in a feedback loop that both terminates guanylyl cyclase activity and leads to their own inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W1490530657,"Lovastatin inhibits mitogenesis in cultured cells and growth of tumors in vivo by unknown mechanism(s). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) is a putative second messenger-generating enzyme whose physical association with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) has been demonstrated to be required for the mitogenic activity of PDGF in cultured fibroblasts. Here we examine the effect of lovastatin on PDGF- and insulin-stimulated PI-3-kinase activity. In quiescent NIH-3T3 cells, PDGF (25 ng/ml) and insulin (200 nM) stimulate PI-3-kinase activity 10- and 6-fold, respectively. However, overnight pretreatment of cells with 10 microM lovastatin inhibits this stimulation of PI-3-kinase activity by PDGF and insulin. Immunoprecipitation of the PI-3-kinase p85 subunit demonstrates a PDGF-dependent association of PI-3-kinase with the tyrosine-autophosphorylated PDGFR. However, upon exposure of cells to 10 microns lovastatin for 40 h, the level of autophosphorylated PDGFR associating with PI-3-kinase after PDGF stimulation decreases significantly (75% reduction). No change in the expression of the PI-3-kinase p85 subunit was observed after treatment of cells with lovastatin. These results demonstrate that lovastatin disrupts a major growth factor signaling pathway and that inhibition of PDGF-induced association of PI-3-kinase with PDGFR and subsequent inhibition of PI-3-kinase activity is one potential mechanism by which lovastatin inhibits cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1514140289,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) Task Force on Birth Control Vaccines has selected the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as a target molecule for a contraceptive vaccine. A synthetic peptide antigen corresponding to the amino acid sequence 109-145 of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the hCG beta-subunit (hCG beta CTP), which is supposed to elicit hCG-immunoneutralizing antibodies, has been submitted to clinical trials. Recent findings suggest that hCG beta CTP does not play a role in the biological activity of hCG. This raises the question concerning the assumed mechanism of action of the hCG beta CTP-based birth control vaccine. We therefore investigated the immunoneutralizing capacity of antibodies directed against hCG beta CTP. Although it is possible to generate specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for hCG by using hCG beta CTP as an immunogen, it appeared that the biological response to hCG was not affected by such antibodies. The reason for this is that the hCG-antibody-complex is still able to bind to target cell receptors and therefore the intended contraceptive effect should not occur. In addition there is a risk of hazardous possible side effects such as an autoimmune reaction against the ovary because we found that at least one epitope is still accessible for antibody binding on receptor-bound hCG. We conclude from our results that both the efficacy and safety of the WHO vaccine are not yet ensured."
https://openalex.org/W1579920912,"Residues Phe33 and Arg35, individually, and a composite mutation of residues Arg42, Ser43, and Lys44 were changed to alanine in the human glycoprotein hormone common alpha-subunit using site-directed mutagenesis. These specific residues are highly conserved across species and have by chemical modification and synthetic peptide approaches been implicated in the binding of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to leutinizing hormone (LH) receptor. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that specific alpha-subunit amino acid residues which stabilize the hormone receptor interaction for hCG have the same function in human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH). Wild type or mutant alpha-subunit cDNAs were coexpressed with wild type hFSH or hCG beta cDNA in sialylation defective Chinese hamster ovary cells. Recombinant hormones were tested in a radioligand receptor competition assay, using rat testis membranes as a source of FSH and LH receptors. Mutant hFSH heterodimers F33A-FSH, R35A-FSH, Arg42-Ser43-Lys44/Ala42-Ala43-Ala44- FSH all displaced 125I-hFSH in a similar fashion, indicating that these residues are not important for binding of hFSH to the rat FSH receptor. On the other hand, F33A-CG evidenced a 5-fold decrease in binding, while R35A-CG had over a 100-fold decrease in binding to the rat LH receptor when compared to the wild type recombinant hCG. These data demonstrate that a receptor-binding site on the common alpha-subunit which is very important for hCG binding to LH receptor is not important for the binding of hFSH to FSH receptor. Our interpretation of these findings is that there are fundamental structural differences in the receptor interface contacts of the common alpha-subunit, which stabilize receptor binding among members of the glycoprotein hormone family."
https://openalex.org/W1517133019,"The molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding for an isoallergenic form of Lol p II, a major rye grass (Lolium perenne) pollen allergen, was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification on mRNA extracted from pollen. The amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA was truncated by 4 and 5 residues at the NH2- and COOH-terminal ends, respectively, and differed only in one position from that previously reported. This cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli by fusion to the carboxyl terminus of the human ferritin H-chain. The molecule was produced in high yields as a soluble protein and was easily purified. The protein retains the multimeric quaternary structure of ferritin, and it exposes on the surface the allergenic moiety, which can be recognized in Western blotting and in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments by specific IgE from allergic patients. The recombinant allergen was used to analyze the sera of 26 patients allergic to L. perenne compared with control sera. The results were in good agreement with the values obtained with the radioallergosorbent test assay. In addition, histamine release experiments in whole blood from an allergic patient and skin prick tests showed that the recombinant allergen retains some of the biological properties of the natural compound. These findings indicate that the availability of homogeneous recombinant allergens may be useful for the development of more specific diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Moreover, this expression system may be of more general interest for producing large amounts of soluble protein domains in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1561244155,"Antibody produced by a variant of the murine antidigoxin hybridoma 26-10 has reduced affinity for digoxin but enhanced recognition of the digoxin 12-hydroxyl due to a Tyr to His substitution at heavy chain position 50 (Schildbach, J. F., Panka, D. J., Parks, D. R., Jager, G. C., Novotny, J., Herzenberg, L. A., Mudgett-Hunter, M., Bruccoleri, R. E., Haber, E., and Margolies, M. N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4640-4647). Consistent with these data, the 26-10 Fab-digoxin x-ray crystal structure (Jeffrey, P. D., Strong, R. K., Sieker, L. C., Chang, C. Y., Campbell, R. L., Petsko, G. A., Haber, E., Margolies, M. N., and Sheriff, S. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press) reveals that Tyr-50 contacts a region of digoxin that includes the hapten-12 carbon. To determine the effects of other heavy chain position 50 substitutions, mutant antibodies were engineered, and their affinities for digoxin and digoxin analogues were measured. The affinity of the mutant antibodies for digoxin roughly correlates with the size of the position 50 side chain. Substitutions of Trp or Phe have no effect on affinity, whereas substitutions of Asn, His, Leu, Ala, Gly, and Asp confer progressively lower affinities. Although Trp and Phe mutants exhibit wild-type specificity, Asn and Asp mutants have improved affinity for digoxin relative to digitoxin (12-deshydroxydigoxin). Leu, Ala, and Gly mutants have improved affinity for 12-acetyldigoxin relative to digoxin as compared with 26-10. These results indicate that position 50 is a determinant of both antibody affinity and fine specificity for antibody 26-10 and that single-amino acid substitutions can alter antibody fine specificity. Models of the mutants were computationally constructed, and haptens were docked into the modeled binding sites. The results suggest that 12-acetyldigoxigenin occupies different orientations in the 26-10 and in the Ala mutant binding sites, resulting in altered binding."

https://openalex.org/W1491557047,"We have examined mechanisms of regulation of the human glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit gene by thyroid hormone (T3) and estradiol. Pituitary-derived GH3 cells were transiently transfected with chimeric constructs comprising between 1,500 and 98 base pairs of human alpha subunit gene 5‘-flanking sequence fused to the bacterial gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (h alpha CAT) and treated with T3 and estradiol, alone and in combination. In pituitary cells, 98 base pairs of alpha gene 5‘-flanking sequence were sufficient to mediate both inhibition of alpha gene promoter activity by T3 and stimulation by estradiol; inhibition of the alpha promoter by T3 was antagonized by estradiol. Mutation of nucleotides essential for T3 receptor binding to the alpha gene thyroid hormone response element abolished the response of h alpha CAT expression to estradiol as well as T3. In contrast to pituitary GH3 cells, estradiol treatment alone had no effect on expression of either h alpha CAT or the endogenous alpha gene in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells cotransfected with a human thyroid hormone receptor expression vector, but estradiol antagonized suppression of both endogenous and transfected alpha promoter activity by T3. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated specific binding of in vitro synthesized human estrogen receptor (ER) to the alpha gene thyroid hormone response element. These findings suggest that estradiol modulates expression of the human alpha subunit gene in pituitary and choriocarcinoma cells by direct binding of ER to the alpha gene promoter, and that interaction of ER with the alpha gene negative TRE accounts for the antagonistic effects of estradiol and T3."
https://openalex.org/W1593467645,"A motor neuron disorder resembling that of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was found in a patient who had received the intramuscular administration of a mixture of bovine brain gangliosides (Yuki, N., Sato, S., Miyatake, T., Sugiyama, K., Katagiri, T., and Sasaki, H. (1991) Lancet 337, 1109-1110). A very high titer of anti-GM2 IgM was detected in the patient's serum and the patient quickly recovered after plasmapheresis. The clinical course of the patient appeared to be different from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the anti-GM2 IgM was thought to be the culprit. The IgM reacted with GM2, GM1b-GalNAc, SPG(alpha 2-3)-GalNAc, and GD1a-GalNAc, but not with GA2 or GD2, meaning that the epitope recognized by the IgM was the GM2-like terminal structure, GalNAc beta 1-4(Neu-Ac alpha 2-3)Gal beta 1-. In this study, we found two novel GM2-epitope containing gangliosides, X1 and X2, in bovine brain gangliosides by TLC immunostaining using the patient's IgM. They were characterized as unique lacto-ganglio type gangliosides containing the following branching structures. [formula: see text] Their unusual structures may be immunogenic to humans to induce anti-GM2 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1481337898,"The structure and expression of the gene encoding serum amyloid P (SAP) component of the Syrian hamster have been studied by isolation of cosmid clones, nucleotide sequence analyses, and quantitation of nuclear run-on transcripts, nuclear RNA, mRNA, and protein levels. Hamster SAP, originally identified as female protein (FP), is a unique pentraxin because pretranslational expression of this gene is modulated by mediators of inflammation and sex steroids. SAP(FP) levels are high in sera from female hamsters and low in males. The response to inflammation is divergent; SAP(FP) levels decrease in females and increase in males during an acute phase response. The SAP(FP) gene encodes a 211 amino acid residue mature polypeptide as well as a 22-residue signal peptide. The intron/exon organization is similar to that of other pentraxins, but additional transcripts are generated from alternate polyadenylation sites in the 3' region. Circulating levels of SAP(FP) and the corresponding hepatic transcript levels are augmented by estrogen, while testosterone, dexamethasone, and progesterone cause a decrease in these levels. In addition the cytokines interleukin-1, -6, and tumor necrosis factor mediate a decrease in hepatic SAP(FP) transcript levels in female hamsters but did not cause a significant elevation of SAP(FP) mRNA in livers of male hamsters. The differences in expression of the SAP(FP) gene between male and female hamsters and between unstimulated male hamsters and male hamsters stimulated with an injection of lipopolysaccharide are due, at least in part, to alterations in transcription."
