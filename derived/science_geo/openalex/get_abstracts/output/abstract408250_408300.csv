https://openalex.org/W2006226224,"PHD2 serves as an oxygen sensor that rescues blood supply by regulating vessel formation and shape in case of oxygen shortage. However, it is unknown whether PHD2 can influence arteriogenesis. Here we studied the role of PHD2 in collateral artery growth by using hindlimb ischaemia as a model, a process that compensates for the lack of blood flow in case of major arterial occlusion. We show that Phd2 (also known as Egln1) haplodeficient (Phd2(+/-)) mice displayed preformed collateral arteries that preserved limb perfusion and prevented tissue necrosis in ischaemia. Improved arteriogenesis in Phd2(+/-) mice was due to an expansion of tissue-resident, M2-like macrophages and their increased release of arteriogenic factors, leading to enhanced smooth muscle cell (SMC) recruitment and growth. Both chronic and acute deletion of one Phd2 allele in macrophages was sufficient to skew their polarization towards a pro-arteriogenic phenotype. Mechanistically, collateral vessel preconditioning relied on the activation of canonical NF-κB pathway in Phd2(+/-) macrophages. These results unravel how PHD2 regulates arteriogenesis and artery homeostasis by controlling a specific differentiation state in macrophages and suggest new treatment options for ischaemic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1990875610,"Identification of the mechanisms that drive the transition from acute to chronic pain could lead to new treatments. Now, Zhizhong Pan and colleagues demonstrate that chronic pain causes epigenetic downregulation of GAD65 and results in inhibitory neurotransmission deficits in the brainstem of rats. Chronic pain is a common neurological disease involving lasting, multifaceted maladaptations ranging from gene modulation to synaptic dysfunction and emotional disorders. Sustained pathological stimuli in many diseases alter the output activities of certain genes through epigenetic modifications, but it is unclear how epigenetic mechanisms operate in the development of chronic pain. We show here that in the rat brainstem nucleus raphe magnus, which is important for central mechanisms of chronic pain, persistent inflammatory and neuropathic pain epigenetically suppresses Gad2 (encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)) transcription through histone deacetylase (HDAC)-mediated histone hypoacetylation, resulting in impaired γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synaptic inhibition. Gad2 knockout mice showed sensitized pain behavior and impaired GABA synaptic function in their brainstem neurons. In wild-type but not Gad2 knockout mice, HDAC inhibitors strongly increased GAD65 activity, restored GABA synaptic function and relieved sensitized pain behavior. These findings suggest GAD65 and HDACs as potential therapeutic targets in an epigenetic approach to the treatment of chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2023028445,"The authors find that cell-intrinsic activation of Hedgehog signaling without genetic alterations is a contributing feature to the progression and chemotherapy resistance of small-cell lung carcinoma, and that Hedgehog inhibition can prevent lung cancer growth and recurrence. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer for which there is no effective treatment1,2. Using a mouse model in which deletion of Rb1 and Trp53 in the lung epithelium of adult mice induces SCLC3,4, we found that the Hedgehog signaling pathway is activated in SCLC cells independently of the lung microenvironment. Constitutive activation of the Hedgehog signaling molecule Smoothened (Smo) promoted the clonogenicity of human SCLC in vitro and the initiation and progression of mouse SCLC in vivo. Reciprocally, deletion of Smo in Rb1 and Trp53-mutant lung epithelial cells strongly suppressed SCLC initiation and progression in mice. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of Hedgehog signaling inhibited the growth of mouse and human SCLC, most notably following chemotherapy. These findings show a crucial cell-intrinsic role for Hedgehog signaling in the development and maintenance of SCLC and identify Hedgehog pathway inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to slow the progression of disease and delay cancer recurrence in individuals with SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W1998329843,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibroproliferative disease characterized by an accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the alveolar wall. Even though the pathogenesis of this fatal disorder remains unclear, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced differentiation and proliferation of myofibroblasts is recognized as a primary event. The molecular pathways involved in TGF-β signalling are generally Smad-dependent yet Smad-independent pathways, including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), have been recently proposed. In this research we established ex-vivo cultures of human lung fibroblasts and we investigated the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in two critical stages of the fibrotic process induced by TGF-β: fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts. Here we show that the pan-inhibitor of PI3Ks LY294002 is able to abrogate the TGF-β-induced increase in cell proliferation, in α- smooth muscle actin expression and in collagen production besides inhibiting Akt phosphorylation, thus demonstrating the centrality of the PI3K/Akt pathway in lung fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, for the first time we show that PI3K p110δ and p110γ are functionally expressed in human lung fibroblasts, in addition to the ubiquitously expressed p110α and β. Finally, results obtained with both selective inhibitors and gene knocking-down experiments demonstrate a major role of p110γ and p110α in both TGF-β-induced fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. This finding suggests that specific PI3K isoforms can be pharmacological targets in IPF."
https://openalex.org/W2055768392,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by intra- and/or extracellular protein aggregation and oxidative stress. Intense attention has been paid to whether protein aggregation itself contributes to abnormal production of free radicals and ensuing cellular oxidative damage. Although this question has been investigated in the context of extracellular protein aggregation, it remains unclear whether protein aggregation inside cells alters the redox homeostasis. To address this, we have used in vitro and in vivo (cellular) models of Huntington disease, one of nine polyglutamine (poly(Q)) disorders, and examined the causal relationship among intracellular protein aggregation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and toxicity. Live imaging of cells expressing a fragment of huntingtin (httExon1) with a poly(Q) expansion shows increased ROS production preceding cell death. ROS production is poly(Q) length-dependent and not due to the httExon 1 flanking sequence. Aggregation inhibition by the MW7 intrabody and Pgl-135 treatment abolishes ROS production, showing that increased ROS is caused by poly(Q) aggregation itself. To examine this hypothesis further, we determined whether aggregation of poly(Q) peptides in vitro generated free radicals. Monitoring poly(Q) protein aggregation using atomic force microscopy and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production over time in parallel we show that oligomerization of httEx1Q53 results in early generation of H(2)O(2). Inhibition of poly(Q) oligomerization by the single chain antibody MW7 abrogates H(2)O(2) formation. These results demonstrate that intracellular protein aggregation directly causes free radical production, and targeting potentially toxic poly(Q) oligomers may constitute a therapeutic target to counteract oxidative stress in poly(Q) diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2009863539,"Microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) is prominently expressed during early stages of neuronal development, and it has been implicated in axonal growth and guidance. MAP1B expression is also found in the adult brain in areas of significant synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that MAP1B is present in dendritic spines, and we describe a decrease in the density of mature dendritic spines in neurons of MAP1B-deficient mice that was accompanied by an increase in the number of immature filopodia-like protrusions. Although these neurons exhibited normal passive membrane properties and action potential firing, AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents were significantly diminished. Moreover, we observed a significant decrease in Rac1 activity and an increase in RhoA activity in the post-synaptic densities of adult MAP1B(+/-) mice when compared with wild type controls. MAP1B(+/-) fractions also exhibited a decrease in phosphorylated cofilin. Taken together, these results indicate a new and important role for MAP1B in the formation and maturation of dendritic spines, possibly through the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This activity of MAP1B could contribute to the regulation of synaptic activity and plasticity in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2041917329,"Cigarette smoke is the primary risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Alterations in the balance between apoptosis and proliferation are involved in the etiology of COPD. Fibroblasts and epithelial cells are sensitive to the oxidative properties of cigarette smoke, and whose loss may precipitate the development of COPD. Fibroblasts express the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that attenuates pulmonary inflammation and may also regulate apoptosis. We hypothesized the AhR would prevent apoptosis caused by cigarette smoke. Using genetically deleted in vitro AhR expression models and an established method of cigarette smoke exposure, we report that AhR expression regulates fibroblasts proliferation and prevents morphological features of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing and chromatin condensation caused by cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Absence of AhR expression results in cleavage of PARP, lamin, and caspase-3. Mitochondrial dysfunction, including cytochrome c release, was associated with loss of AhR expression, indicating activation of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Heightened sensitivity of AhR-deficient fibroblasts was not the result of alterations in GSH, Nrf2, or HO-1 expression. Instead, AhR(-/-) cells had significantly less MnSOD and CuZn-SOD expression, enzymes that protects against oxidative stress. The ability of the AhR to suppress apoptosis was not restricted to fibroblasts, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of the AhR in lung epithelial cells also increased sensitivity to smoke-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that cigarette smoke induced loss of lung structural support (i.e. fibroblasts, epithelial cells) caused by aberrations in AhR expression may explain why some smokers develop lung diseases such as COPD."
https://openalex.org/W1975857103,"Histone methyltransferase G9a has been understood primarily as a corepressor of gene expression, but we showed previously that G9a positively regulates nuclear receptor-mediated transcription in reporter gene assays. Here, we show that endogenous G9a contributes to the estradiol (E(2))-dependent induction of some endogenous target genes of estrogen receptor (ER)α in MCF-7 breast cancer cells while simultaneously limiting the E(2)-induced expression of other ERα target genes. Thus, G9a has a dual and selective role as a coregulator for ERα target genes. The ERα binding regions associated with the pS2 gene, which requires G9a for E(2)-induced expression, are transiently occupied by G9a at 15 min after beginning E(2) treatment, suggesting that G9a coactivator function is by direct interaction with ERα target genes. Transient reporter gene assays with deletion mutants of G9a demonstrated that domains previously associated with the corepressor functions of G9a (C-terminal methyltransferase domain, ankyrin repeat domain, and cysteine-rich domain) were unnecessary for G9a coactivator function in ERα-mediated transcription. In contrast, the N-terminal domain of G9a was necessary and sufficient for enhancement of ERα-mediated transcription and for E(2)-induced occupancy of G9a on ERα binding sites associated with endogenous target genes of ERα. In addition to a previously identified activation domain, this region contains a previously uncharacterized ligand-dependent ERα binding function, indicating how G9a is recruited to the target genes. Therefore, the coactivator and corepressor functions of G9a involve different G9a domains and different molecular mechanisms."

Yet the role of ATP synthase in malaria parasites has remained unclear, as blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum appear to derive ATP largely through glycolysis. Also, genes for essential subunits of the FO sector of the complex could not be detected in the parasite genomes. Here, we have used molecular genetic and immunological tools to investigate the localization, complex formation, and functional significance of predicted ATP synthase subunits in P. falciparum. We generated transgenic P. falciparum lines expressing seven epitope-tagged canonical ATP synthase subunits, revealing localization of all but one of the subunits to the mitochondrion. Blue native gel electrophoresis of P. falciparum mitochondrial membranes suggested the molecular mass of the ATP synthase complex to be greater than 1 million daltons. This size is consistent with the complex being assembled as a dimer in a manner similar to the complexes observed in other eukaryotic organisms. This observation also suggests the presence of previously unknown subunits in addition to the canonical subunits in P. falciparum ATP synthase complex. Our attempts to disrupt genes encoding β and γ subunits were unsuccessful, suggesting an essential role played by the ATP synthase complex in blood stages of P. falciparum. These studies suggest that, despite some unconventional features and its minimal contribution to ATP synthesis, P. falciparum ATP synthase is localized to the parasite mitochondrion, assembled as a large dimeric complex, and is likely essential for parasite survival.

https://openalex.org/W1983282473,"Background Mesothelioma is a highly malignant tumor that is primarily caused by occupational or environmental exposure to asbestos fibers. Despite worldwide restrictions on asbestos usage, further cases are expected as diagnosis is typically 20–40 years after exposure. Once diagnosed there is a very poor prognosis with a median survival rate of 9 months. Considering this the development of early pre clinical diagnostic markers may help improve clinical outcomes. Methodology Microarray expression arrays on mesothelium and other tissues dissected from mice were used to identify candidate mesothelial lineage markers. Candidates were further tested by qRTPCR and in-situ hybridization across a mouse tissue panel. Two candidate biomarkers with the potential for secretion, uroplakin 3B (UPK3B), and leucine rich repeat neuronal 4 (LRRN4) and one commercialized mesothelioma marker, mesothelin (MSLN) were then chosen for validation across a panel of normal human primary cells, 16 established mesothelioma cell lines, 10 lung cancer lines, and a further set of 8 unrelated cancer cell lines. Conclusions Within the primary cell panel, LRRN4 was only detected in primary mesothelial cells, but MSLN and UPK3B were also detected in other cell types. MSLN was detected in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells and UPK3B was detected in retinal pigment epithelial cells and urothelial cells. Testing the cell line panel, MSLN was detected in 15 of the 16 mesothelioma cells lines, whereas LRRN4 was only detected in 8 and UPK3B in 6. Interestingly MSLN levels appear to be upregulated in the mesothelioma lines compared to the primary mesothelial cells, while LRRN4 and UPK3B, are either lost or down-regulated. Despite the higher fraction of mesothelioma lines positive for MSLN, it was also detected at high levels in 2 lung cancer lines and 3 other unrelated cancer lines derived from papillotubular adenocarcinoma, signet ring carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2074922627,"Steatosis is a frequent complication of hepatitis C virus infection. In mice, this condition is recapitulated by the expression of a single viral protein, the nucleocapsid core. Core localizes to the surface of lipid droplets (LDs) in infected liver cells through a process dependent on host diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), an enzyme that synthesizes triglycerides in the endoplasmic reticulum. Whether DGAT1 also plays a role in core-induced steatosis is uncertain. Here, we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from DGAT1−/− mice are protected from core-induced steatosis, as are livers of DGAT1−/− mice expressing core, demonstrating that the steatosis is DGAT1-dependent. Surprisingly, core expression did not increase DGAT1 activity or triglyceride synthesis, thus excluding the possibility that core activates DGAT1 to cause steatosis. Instead, we find that DGAT1-dependent localization of core to LDs is a prerequisite for the steatogenic properties of the core. Using biochemical and immunofluorescence microscopy techniques, we show that the turnover of lipids in core-coated droplets is decreased, providing a physiological mechanism for core-induced steatosis. Our results support a bipartite model in which core first requires DGAT1 to gain access to LDs, and then LD-localized core interferes with triglyceride turnover, thus stabilizing lipid droplets and leading to steatosis.

The correlation between the degree of steatosis and viral replication, as assessed by viral load, points to an important role of steatosis in HCV infection with genotype 3a strains (4Adinolfi L.E.

In genotype 3a-infected patients, steatosis also frequently resolves after successful clearance of HCV after antiviral therapy, providing further evidence for a direct association of steatosis with HCV infection (6Kumar D.

Hepatology. 2003; 38: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the most frequent genotype in the United States and Europe, the degree of steatosis is inversely related to the response to antiviral therapy (8Sanyal A.J. Liver Int. 2011; 31: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transgenic mice expressing the viral nucleocapsid protein core in their livers also develop steatosis, implying that viral infection itself may contribute to this process. In fact, some core-transgenic mouse strains progress from steatosis to hepatocellular carcinoma, recapitulating what is seen in some HCV-infected patients (9Moriya K. Fujie H. Shintani Y.

Hepatic steatosis is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs), which serve as central organelles in the HCV life cycle. The viral core protein localizes to LDs and initiates production of viral particles at LD-associated membranes of the ER (11Miyanari Y. Atsuzawa K. Usuda N. Watashi K. Hishiki T. Zayas M.

Core is produced in the ER and consists of the first 191 amino acids of the large viral polyprotein precursor that is translated from the positive-strand HCV RNA genome. The polyprotein is co- and post-translationally processed to structural and nonstructural proteins by host and viral proteases (14Selby M.J. Choo Q.L. Berger K. Kuo G. Glazer E. Eckart M. Lee C. Chien D. Kuo C. Houghton M. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Core anchors the polyprotein at the ER membrane through a C-terminal signal peptide that translocates subsequent E1 and E2 envelope proteins into the ER lumen (14Selby M.J. Choo Q.L. Berger K. Kuo G. Glazer E. Eckart M. Lee C. Chien D. Kuo C. Houghton M. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). After two sequential cleavages at the C terminus by host peptidases, processed core remains attached to the outer leaflet of the ER membrane and gains access to the surface of LDs (15McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The localization of core to intracellular LDs provides a platform for viral assembly and therefore appears to be a key step in viral replication. How the core protein induces LD accumulation and hepatic steatosis remains incompletely understood. One possibility that was previously reported was core-induced inhibition of the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a key protein in VLDL assembly and lipid export from hepatocytes (16Perlemuter G. Sabile A. Letteron P. Vona G. Topilco A. Chrétien Y. Koike K. Pessayre D. Chapman J. Barba G. Bréchot C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). More recent studies demonstrated that MTP function and lipoprotein secretion may be vital for functional HCV release (17Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Core also alters the expression of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis by activating transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ in cultured cells and in core-transgenic mice (20Yamaguchi A.

It is unclear whether these transcriptional changes are a direct consequence of core expression or reflect secondary changes because of altered metabolic homeostasis. In support of a model where core plays a direct role in altering transcriptional events, core was shown to bind and activate the DNA-binding domain of the retinoid X receptor α, a transcriptional regulator involved in the regulation of cellular lipid synthesis (24Tsutsumi T. Suzuki T. Shimoike T. Suzuki R. Moriya K. Shintani Y. Fujie H. Matsuura Y. Koike K. Miyamura T. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that genotype 3a core protein induces the formation of large lipid droplets in hepatoma cells by decreasing the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) (25Clement S. Peyrou M. Sanchez-Pareja A. Bourgoin L. Ramadori P. Suter D. Vinciguerra M. Guilloux K. Pascarella S. Rubbia-Brandt L. Negro F. Foti M. Hepatology. 2011; 54: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). IRS-1 has also been linked to the development of insulin resistance in HCV-infected patients in a genotype-specific manner; genotype 3a core causes IRS-1 degradation through down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and up-regulation of suppressor of cytokine signal 7 (SOCS7), whereas genotype 1b core instead activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (26Pazienza V. Clément S. Pugnale P. Conzelman S. Foti M. Mangia A. Negro F. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 1164-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Ultimately, steatosis reflects the accumulation of lipid droplets, which reflects the production and clearance of cellular triacylglycerols (TGs). We showed recently that core specifically interacts with DGAT1 (27Herker E. Harris C. Hernandez C. Carpentier A. Kaehlcke K. Rosenberg A.R. Farese Jr., R.V. Ott M. Nat.

However, although DGAT2 deficiency in mice is lethal early after birth, DGAT1 deficiency protects against hepatic steatosis in both diet-induced obesity and fasting paradigms, but it has no effect on steatosis in situations where de novo lipogenesis is increased (32Villanueva C.J. Monetti M. Shih M. Zhou P. Watkins S.M. Bhanot S. Farese Jr., R.V. Hepatology. 2009; 50: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). DGAT1 activity is critical to the localization of core to the surface of LDs, and interference with DGAT1 activity restricts core localization to the ER and blocks the assembly and release of infectious HCV progeny virions (27Herker E. Harris C. Hernandez C. Carpentier A. Kaehlcke K. Rosenberg A.R. Farese Jr., R.V. Ott M. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 1295-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The link of core to DGAT1 suggested that the mechanism of steatosis might relate to TG synthesis. Here, we show that core-induced steatosis is indeed DGAT1-dependent. However, we found no effect of core on increasing TG synthesis, but we instead uncover a novel mechanism in which LD-bound core blocks TG turnover. Our studies suggest an unexpected bipartite mechanism in which the viral core protein utilizes the host DGAT1 enzyme to gain access to LDs, and once localized to this compartment, it interferes with LD TG turnover, thereby stabilizing LDs necessary for viral assembly. Lentiviral expression constructs of core were as described previously (27Herker E. Harris C. Hernandez C. Carpentier A. Kaehlcke K. Rosenberg A.R. Farese Jr., R.V. Ott M. Nat.

To generate the adenoviral core expression construct, the 191-amino acid core coding sequence (genotype 1b, NC1) was cloned into pAdEasy via the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV (34He T.C.

Eight to 10-week-old male DGAT1−/− mice and control C57BL6 mice were administered 4.5 × 1010 pfu of adenovirus-expressing EGFP or core/EGFP in 300 μl of normal saline by tail vein injection. Four days later, mice were sacrificed and livers harvested. All animal experiments were approved by the University of California, San Francisco, IACUC.

For loading of cells with oleate, cells were incubated in the presence of 300 μm BSA-bound oleate (Sigma) for the indicated times. For the histological analysis of liver sections, livers were fixed in paraformaldehyde for 16 h, sucrose-infiltrated, and frozen in OCT using dry ice and 2-methylbutane. Sections were cut at 8 μm and allowed to dry overnight. OCT was removed by running water for 10 min and equilibrated in 50% and then 100% propylene glycol (Sigma) for 3 min each. The slides were stained in 1% ORO (Sigma) in propylene glycol for 18 h. Slides were then differentiated in three changes of 85% propylene glycol followed by a 10-min running water wash. Slides were counterstained in Mayers hematoxylin for 5 s, washed, and blued in running water and mounted using an aqueous mountant (CC-mount, American Mastertech). Cells and liver sections were analyzed with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with EC Plan NeoFluar 10×/0.3 PHM27, EC Plan NeoFluar 20×/0.5 PHM27, EC Plan NeoFluar 40×/0.75 PH, and Plan Apo 63×/1.4 Oil DIC M27 objectives, filter sets 38HE, 43HE, 45, and 50, Optivar 1.25 and ×1.6 magnification, and an Axiocam MRM REV 3 and an Axiocam IC3. For quantification of LD content, we counted the ORO-positive area per cell with the automatic measurement program of the Zeiss Axiovision software. The ORO-positive area in EGFP-positive cells was quantified and divided by the total number of cells. For the sucrose gradient, liver samples were lysed in hypotonic buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), supplemented with protease inhibitors, with 40 strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. After spinning for 5 min at 1500 rpm, post-nuclear fractions were mixed with equal volumes of 2 m sucrose in isotonic buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2) and placed above a 2 m sucrose cushion in SW41 (Beckman) centrifuge tubes, overlaid with isotonic buffer containing decreasing concentrations of sucrose (0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 m in isotonic buffer with 1 mm PMSF), and centrifuged for 16 h at 100,000 × g.

For the measurement of TG synthesis rates, cells were incubated in the presence of 0.125 μCi/ml [1-14C]oleic acid (GE Healthcare, 58 mCi/mmol) for 4 h. [1-14C]Oleic acid was dried under a nitrogen stream and then complexed to 10% bovine serum albumin before addition to the cells. Lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2), dried, loaded onto thin layer chromatography plates, and quantified as above with a Bioscan AR-2000 instrument.

Endogenous mTOR was immunoprecipitated from clarified lysates with mTOR antibodies and protein G-agarose (Sigma). Equal amount of beads were used in mTOR activity assays according to the manufacturer's protocol (K-LISA, Calbiochem).

Cells were incubated with 400 μm BSA-bound oleate containing 0.125 μCi/ml [1-14C]oleic acid (GE Healthcare, 58 mCi/mmol) for 16 h to stimulate storage of TGs. Cells were then washed and incubated in fresh medium (containing 6 μm triacsin C for indicated times), and the amount of remaining labeled cellular TG was determined as above. For microscopic analysis, cells were loaded with 400 μm BSA-bound oleate for 16 h and incubated in fresh medium in the presence of 6 μm triacsin C. They were then fixed in paraformaldehyde and stained with ORO and Hoechst. When one variable differed between experimental groups, unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests were used. When experimental groups differed in two variables, two-way ANOVA was used with appropriate post-testing. To examine whether core-induced lipid accumulation involves a specific DGAT enzyme, we introduced core into mouse embryonic fibroblasts from DGAT1- or DGAT2-deficient mice (29Harris C.A. Haas J.T. Streeper R.S. Stone S.J. Kumari M. Yang K. Han X. Brownell N. Gross R.W. Zechner R. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 2011; 52: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and examined LD accumulation by ORO staining and fluorescent microscopy. Core expression caused an ∼60-fold increase in cellular LD content in wild-type (WT) and DGAT2−/− fibroblasts but not DGAT1−/− fibroblasts, pointing to a unique relationship between core and DGAT1-generated LDs (Fig. 1, A and B). DGAT1−/−, DGAT2−/−, and WT fibroblasts expressed core at similar levels (Fig. 1C), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts of each genotype formed LDs normally after incubation with monounsaturated fatty acids (oleate, Fig. 1A), indicating that either DGAT enzyme was competent for generating LDs from this stimulus. Core localized to LDs in WT and DGAT2−/− fibroblasts but not in DGAT1−/− cells where it showed a distinct reticular staining, consistent with its localization at the ER (Fig. 1D). Remarkably, core localization did not change in DGAT1−/− cells treated with oleate containing numerous LDs formed via DGAT2 (Fig. 1D). These results underscore a connection between the ability of the core to bind LDs and to induce lipid accumulation, and they indicate that DGAT1 is important in both processes. We confirmed these results with a DGAT1-specific small molecule inhibitor, 2-((1S,4S)-4-(4-(4-amino-7,7-dimethyl-7H-pyrimido[4,5-b][1,4]oxazin-6-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid, described previously (27Herker E.

Treatment with the inhibitor efficiently suppressed core-induced LD accumulation in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and prevented core association with LDs (Fig. 2). To determine whether DGAT1 is also important for core-induced steatosis in vivo, we expressed core in the livers of DGAT1−/− mice. We generated adenoviral vectors expressing both core and EGFP or EGFP alone, and these were injected into tail veins of WT and DGAT1-deficient mice. Four days after injection, livers were harvested, and lysates were subjected to Western blotting. Similar levels of core expression were detected in WT and DGAT1−/− mouse livers (Fig. 3A). In addition, regardless of the DGAT1 genotype, EGFP was similarly expressed in mice after injections with control or core-expressing viral stocks. Core or EGFP expression was not detected in organs other than the liver in injected mice (data not shown). Core expression induced an ∼5-fold increase in TG levels (compared with EGFP control-injected mice) in WT but not in DGAT1−/− mouse livers (Fig. 3, A and B). Therefore, WT mice were more susceptible to core-induced steatosis than DGAT1−/− mice (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA). In fact, TG levels in DGAT1−/− mice injected with core-expressing viral stocks were similar to those of WT or DGAT1−/− mice infected with control virus (Fig. 3, A and B). The same was observed in histological sections after staining with ORO; accumulation of ORO-positive LDs occurred only in livers of core-expressing WT mice, indicating that DGAT1 is required for core-induced steatosis in vivo (Fig. 3C). As DGAT1 apparently directs core onto the surface of LDs (27Herker E. Harris C. Hernandez C. Carpentier A. Kaehlcke K. Rosenberg A.R. Farese Jr., R.V. Ott M. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 1295-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we isolated LDs by sucrose gradient centrifugation from livers of core-expressing WT and DGAT1−/− mice. Core was readily detected by Western blot analysis in the LD fraction in liver extracts from WT, but not DGAT1−/−, mice (Fig. 3D, LD fraction marked by red arrows). This fraction was also enriched in ADRP, another LD-associated protein, but it lacked EGFP and calreticulin. Calreticulin is an ER-anchored protein, which, as expected, was only present in higher density fractions (Fig. 3D). A similar result was observed when two sequential sucrose gradient centrifugations were performed, and the amount of LD protein loaded was normalized to ADRP levels in both genotypes (Fig. 3E). These results show that DGAT1 is required for core to access LDs in vivo and confirm the requirement for DGAT1 in mediating core-induced steatosis. Given that DGAT1 was required for core-induced hepatic steatosis and because core and DGAT1 physically interact (27Herker E. Harris C. Hernandez C. Carpentier A. Kaehlcke K. Rosenberg A.R."
https://openalex.org/W2109057601,"The relatively new field of onco-metabolomics attempts to identify relationships between various cancer phenotypes and global metabolite content. Previous metabolomics studies utilized either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and analyzed metabolites present in urine and serum. However, direct metabolomic assessment of tumor tissues is important for determining altered metabolism in cancers. In this respect, the ability to obtain reliable data from archival specimens is desirable and has not been reported to date. In this feasibility study, we demonstrate the analysis of polar metabolites extracted directly from ten formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens, including five soft tissue sarcomas and five paired normal samples. Using targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) via selected reaction monitoring (SRM), we detect an average of 106 metabolites across the samples with excellent reproducibility and correlation between different sections of the same specimen. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis reliably recovers a priori known tumor and normal tissue phenotypes, and supervised analysis identifies candidate metabolic markers supported by the literature. In addition, we find that diverse biochemical processes are well-represented in the list of detected metabolites. Our study supports the notion that reliable and broadly informative metabolomic data may be acquired from FFPE soft tissue sarcoma specimens, a finding that is likely to be extended to other malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2013184779,"Synaptic transmission relies on several processes, such as the location of a released vesicle, the number and type of receptors, trafficking between the postsynaptic density (PSD) and extrasynaptic compartment, as well as the synapse organization. To study the impact of these parameters on excitatory synaptic transmission, we present a computational model for the fast AMPA-receptor mediated synaptic current. We show that in addition to the vesicular release probability, due to variations in their release locations and the AMPAR distribution, the postsynaptic current amplitude has a large variance, making a synapse an intrinsic unreliable device. We use our model to examine our experimental data recorded from CA1 mice hippocampal slices to study the differences between mEPSC and evoked EPSC variance. The synaptic current but not the coefficient of variation is maximal when the active zone where vesicles are released is apposed to the PSD. Moreover, we find that for certain type of synapses, receptor trafficking can affect the magnitude of synaptic depression. Finally, we demonstrate that perisynaptic microdomains located outside the PSD impacts synaptic transmission by regulating the number of desensitized receptors and their trafficking to the PSD. We conclude that geometrical modifications, reorganization of the PSD or perisynaptic microdomains modulate synaptic strength, as the mechanisms underlying long-term plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2146909750,"Background Phytocyanins (PCs) are plant-specific blue copper proteins involved in electron transport, and a large number of known PCs are considered to be chimeric arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). To date there has not been a genome-wide overview of the OsPC gene family. Therefore, as the first step and a useful strategy to elucidate the functions of OsPCs, there is an urgent need for a thorough genome-wide analysis of this gene family. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, a total of 62 OsPC genes were identified through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome. Based on phylogeny and motif constitution, the family of OsPCs was classified into three subclasses: uclacyanin-like proteins (OsUCLs), stellacyanin-like proteins (OsSCLs) and early nodulin-like proteins (OsENODLs). Structure and glycosylation prediction indicated that 46 OsPCs were glycosylphosphatigylinositol-anchored proteins and 38 OsPCs were chimeric AGPs. Gene duplication analysis revealed that chromosomal segment and tandem duplications contributed almost equally to the expansion of this gene family, and duplication events were mostly happened in the OsUCL subfamily. The expression profiles of OsPC genes were analyzed at different stages of vegetative and reproductive development and under abiotic stresses. It revealed that a large number of OsPC genes were abundantly expressed in the various stages of development. Moreover, 17 genes were regulated under the treatments of abiotic stresses. Conclusions/Significance The genome-wide identification and expression analysis of OsPC genes should facilitate research in this gene family and give new insights toward elucidating their functions in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1984113754,"The melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) gene is pleiotropic, influencing body composition, natriuresis, immune function, and entrainment of circadian rhythms to nutrient intake. MC3Rs are expressed in hypothalamic and limbic regions of the brain and in peripheral tissues. To investigate the roles of central MC3Rs, we inserted a ""lox-stop-lox"" (LoxTB) 5' of the translation initiation codon of the mouse Mc3r gene and reactivated transcription using neuron-specific Cre transgenic mice. As predicted based on earlier observations of Mc3r knock-out mice, Mc3r(TB/TB) mice displayed reduced lean mass, increased fat mass, and accelerated diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, rescuing Mc3r expression in the nervous system using the Nestin-Cre transgene only partially rescued obesity in chow-fed conditions and had no impact on the accelerated diet-induced obesity phenotype. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a critical node in the neural networks regulating feeding-related behaviors and metabolic homeostasis, exhibits dense Mc3r expression relative to other brain regions. To target VMH MC3R expression, we used the steroidogenic factor-1 Cre transgenic mouse. Although restoring VMH MC3R signaling also had a modest impact on obesity, marked improvements in metabolic homeostasis were observed. VMH MC3R signaling was not sufficient to rescue the lean mass phenotype or the regulation of behaviors anticipating food anticipation. These results suggest that actions of MC3Rs impacting on energy homeostasis involve both central and peripheral sites of action. The impact of central MC3Rs on behavior and metabolism involves divergent pathways; VMH MC3R signaling improves metabolic homeostasis but does not significantly impact on the expression of behaviors anticipating nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W1992417877,"We have studied the pathways for Ca(2+) transport in mitochondria of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate the presence of ruthenium red (RR)-sensitive Ca(2+) uptake, of RR-insensitive Ca(2+) release, and of Na(+)-stimulated Ca(2+) release in energized mitochondria, which match well characterized Ca(2+) transport pathways of mammalian mitochondria. Following larger matrix Ca(2+) loading Drosophila mitochondria underwent spontaneous RR-insensitive Ca(2+) release, an event that in mammals is due to opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP). Like the PTP of mammals, Drosophila Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release could be triggered by uncoupler, diamide, and N-ethylmaleimide, indicating the existence of regulatory voltage- and redox-sensitive sites and was inhibited by tetracaine. Unlike PTP-mediated Ca(2+) release in mammals, however, it was (i) insensitive to cyclosporin A, ubiquinone 0, and ADP; (ii) inhibited by P(i), as is the PTP of yeast mitochondria; and (iii) not accompanied by matrix swelling and cytochrome c release even in KCl-based medium.

High levels of genetic diversity, as well as a significant correspondence between genetic and geographic distances, suggest that the invasion process might have been gradual, with no associated genetic bottlenecks. Three population groups could be identified, nevertheless the overall genetic structure was weak. The effective number of migrants between populations, estimated using the coalescent method, suggested asymmetric gene flow from the costal region of Guangdong to most inland regions.

Restless Legs Syndrome negatively affects quality of life; however it is not clear whether this is due to mental or physical parameters and whether an association exists between the syndrome and parameters affecting survival. Methodοlogy/Principal Findings Using the Restless Legs Syndrome criteria and the presence of Periodic Limb Movements in Sleep (PLMS/h >15), 70 clinically stable hemodialysis patients were assessed and divided into the RLS (n = 30) and non-RLS (n = 40) groups. Physical performance was evaluated by a battery of tests: body composition by dual energy X ray absorptiometry, muscle size and composition by computer tomography, while depression symptoms, perception of sleep quality and quality of life were assessed through validated questionnaires. In this cross sectional analysis, the RLS group showed evidence of thigh muscle atrophy compared to the non-RLS group. Sleep quality and depression score were found to be significantly impaired in the RLS group. The mental component of the quality of life questionnaire appeared significantly diminished in the RLS group, reducing thus the overall quality of life score. In contrast, there were no significant differences between groups in any of the physical performance tests, body and muscle composition. Conclusions The low level of quality of life reported by the HD patients with Restless Legs Syndrome seems to be due mainly to mental health and sleep related aspects. Increased evidence of muscle atrophy is also observed in the RLS group and possibly can be attributed to the lack of restorative sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2127560698,"Neuronal activity regulates a broad range of processes in the hippocampus, including the precise regulation of translation. Disruptions in proper translational control in the nervous system are associated with a variety of disorders that fall in the autistic spectrum. MicroRNA (miRNA) represent a relatively recently discovered player in the regulation of translation in the nervous system. We have conducted an in depth analysis of how neuronal activity regulates miRNA expression in the hippocampus. Using deep sequencing we exhaustively identify all miRNAs, including 15 novel miRNAs, expressed in hippocampus of the adult mouse. We identified 119 miRNAs documented in miRBase but less than half of these miRNA were expressed at a level greater than 0.1% of total miRNA. Expression profiling following induction of neuronal activity by electroconvulsive shock demonstrates that most miRNA show a biphasic pattern of expression: rapid induction of specific mature miRNA expression followed by a decline in expression. These results have important implications into how miRNAs influence activity-dependent translational control."

Here we have determined the complete mouse amelogenin structure under physiological conditions and defined interactions between individual domains. NMR spectroscopy revealed four major amelogenin structural motifs, including an N-terminal assembly of four α-helical segments (S9-V19, T21-P33, Y39-W45, V53-Q56), an elongated random coil region interrupted by two 3(10) helices (∼P60-Q117), an extended proline-rich PPII-helical region (P118-L165), and a charged hydrophilic C-terminus (L165-D180). HSQC experiments demonstrated ipsilateral interactions between terminal domains of individual amelogenin molecules, i.e. N-terminal interactions with corresponding N-termini and C-terminal interactions with corresponding C-termini, while the central random coil domain did not engage in interactions. Our HSQC spectra of the full-length amelogenin central domain region completely overlapped with spectra of the monomeric Amel-M fragment, suggesting that the central amelogenin coil region did not involve in assembly, even in assembled nanospheres. This finding was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. We conclude that under conditions resembling those found in the developing enamel protein matrix, amelogenin molecules form complex 3D-structures with N-terminal α-helix-like segments and C-terminal PPII-helices, which self-assemble through ipsilateral interactions at the N-terminus of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2030331032,"Serum response factor (SRF) plays a central role in regulating expression of smooth muscle-specific genes partly by associating with the potent tissue-specific cofactor myocardin. Previous studies have shown that transforming growth factor-β1-induced transcript 1 (TGFB1I1, also known as Hic-5) is a TGF-β-responsive gene and is involved in the cellular response to vascular injury, but the regulation of TGFB1I1 expression remains elusive. In this report, we demonstrated that TGFB1I1 is a novel marker for the smooth muscle contractile phenotype and is regulated by SRF/myocardin. We found that TGFB1I1 is specifically expressed in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and in smooth muscle-rich tissues. Furthermore, TGFB1I1 expression is significantly down-regulated in a variety of models for smooth muscle phenotypic modulation. The TGFB1I1 promoter contains an evolutionarily conserved CArG element, and this element is indispensible for myocardin-induced transactivation of TGFB1I1 promoter. By oligonucleotide pulldown and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that SRF binds to this CArG element in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of myocardin is sufficient to induce endogenous TGFB1I1 expression in multiple cell lines whereas knocking-down myocardin or SRF significantly attenuated TGFB1I1 expression in SMCs. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that SRF is essential for TGF-β-mediated induction of TGFB1I1. Finally, silencing of TGFB1I1 expression significantly promotes SMC proliferation. Collectively, this study provides the first evidence that TGFB1I1 is not only an SRF/myocardin-regulated smooth muscle marker but also critical for maintaining smooth muscle contractile phenotype by inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2048944954,"Some of the senses, such as colour vision and olfaction, rely on single sensory neurons to produce a specific chemical- or light-sensing G-protein coupled receptor. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain exclusive gene expression in olfactory receptors, but the molecular pathways remain unknown. Claude Desplan and colleagues report that mature Drosophila R8 photoreceptors of the subtype that normally expresses green-sensing rhodopsin 6 protein can express the 'wrong' blue-sensing rhodopsin 5 when fruitflies are either kept in the dark or mutated in rhodopsin 6. Light thus achieves a negative feedback on the rh5 gene by repressing its transcription in rh6-expressing neurons, a system resembling the control of olfactory receptor genes in vertebrate olfactory neurons. Sensory systems with high discriminatory power use neurons that express only one of several alternative sensory receptor proteins. This exclusive receptor gene expression restricts the sensitivity spectrum of neurons and is coordinated with the choice of their synaptic targets1,2,3. However, little is known about how it is maintained throughout the life of a neuron. Here we show that the green-light sensing receptor rhodopsin 6 (Rh6) acts to exclude an alternative blue-sensitive rhodopsin 5 (Rh5) from a subset of Drosophila R8 photoreceptor neurons4. Loss of Rh6 leads to a gradual expansion of Rh5 expression into all R8 photoreceptors of the ageing adult retina. The Rh6 feedback signal results in repression of the rh5 promoter and can be mimicked by other Drosophila rhodopsins; it is partly dependent on activation of rhodopsin by light, and relies on Gαq activity, but not on the subsequent steps of the phototransduction cascade5. Our observations reveal a thus far unappreciated spectral plasticity of R8 photoreceptors, and identify rhodopsin feedback as an exclusion mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2089397308,"Protein kinases of the microtubule affinity regulating kinase (MARK)/Par-1 family play important roles in the establishment of cellular polarity, cell cycle control, and intracellular signal transduction. Disturbance of their function is linked to cancer and brain diseases, e.g. lissencephaly and Alzheimer disease. To understand the biological role of MARK family kinases, we searched for specific inhibitors and a biosensor for MARK activity. A screen of the ChemBioNet library containing ∼18,000 substances yielded several compounds with inhibitory activity in the low micromolar range and capable of inhibiting MARK activity in cultured cells and primary neurons, as judged by MARK-dependent phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins and its consequences for microtubule integrity. Four of the compounds share a 9-oxo-9H-acridin-10-yl structure as a basis that will serve as a lead for optimization of inhibition efficiency. To test these inhibitors, we developed a cellular biosensor for MARK activity based on a MARK target sequence attached to the 14-3-3 scaffold protein and linked to enhanced cyan or teal and yellow fluorescent protein as FRET donor and acceptor pairs. Transfection of the teal/yellow fluorescent protein sensor into neurons and imaging by fluorescence lifetime imaging revealed that MARK was particularly active in the axons and growth cones of differentiating neurons.

In the brain one important role of MARK2 is in the control of neuronal migration during brain development, which is in turn linked to the dynamics of the cytoskeleton (11Sapir T. Shmueli A. Levy T.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The structures of the catalytic and the ubiquitin-associated domains and C-terminal “kinase-associated” domain of MARK isoforms have been solved by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, respectively (13Panneerselvam S.

Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2534-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal header and the central spacer domains appear to be largely disordered (see Fig. 1A). Within the human kinome, MARKs are part of the AMPK subfamily within the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II group of kinases (15Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6215) Google Scholar), which includes AMPKα1 and -2 and BRSK1 and -2 (also known as SAD-A and -B), some of which are also prominent in neurons and may have partially overlapping functions (16Barnes A.P.

In cells the catalytic activity of MARK is regulated by intramolecular domain interactions (e.g. ubiquitin-associated domain and kinase associated domains), phosphorylation by other kinases (activating: MARKK, LKB1 (17Timm T.

One of the prominent targets of MARK is Tau and the related proteins MAP2 and MAP4 within the KXGS motifs of their microtubule binding domains (see Fig. 1B). As a result, the affinity of these MAPs to microtubules is strongly decreased, and their function of stabilizing microtubules can no longer be performed. Although the dynamic instability of microtubules is a desired feature during the process of polarization of a cell and for the outgrowth of cell processes, neurites, and dendritic spines (23Biernat J. Wu Y.Z. Timm T. Zheng-Fischhöfer Q. Mandelkow E. Meijer L. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4013-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), the delicate balance of MARK and the counteracting phosphatases can easily be disturbed, with detrimental effects to the cell. Either the excess of bound Tau can block access of motor proteins to microtubules, which serve as tracks for cellular transport (24Stamer K. Vogel R. Thies E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), or the phosphorylated Tau is not capable to stabilize the microtubules. In both cases there is transport inhibition, and important supplies of material and energy for the synapses cannot take place, and the cell extensions decay. In addition, Tau molecules not bound to microtubules can undergo missorting and aggregation. These processes represent hallmarks of Alzheimer disease, where MARK-dependent phosphorylation occurs at an early stage (25Augustinack J.C. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Hyman B.T. Acta Neuropath. 2002; 103: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) and MARK protein itself is elevated in the pathological Tau aggregates (26Chin J.Y. Knowles R.B. Schneider A. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This increased MARK-induced phosphorylation of Tau can also be detected in the brains of Tau transgenic mice as an early sign of degeneration (27Eckermann K. Mocanu M.M. Khlistunova I. Biernat J. Nissen A. Hofmann A. Schönig K. Bujard H. Haemisch A. Mandelkow E. Zhou L. Rune G. Mandelkow E.M. J. Biol.

However, it is currently not clear where and how the overactivation of MARK is initiated, and there are thus far no specific inhibitors of the kinase. This prompted us to begin a search for low Mr inhibitors of MARK and to develop reagents that enable the observation of MARK activity and MARK function in living neuronal cells. Kinase activities were assayed in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm benzamidine) for 60 min at 30 °C. Final concentration of [32P]ATP (3.7 × 107 MBq/mol) was 100 μm, and Tau peptide TR1, histone H1, or hTau40 was 100, 7.5, and 2.5 μm, respectively. Reactions were stopped by the addition of sample loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie (RothiBlueTM), gels were dried, and radioactivity was detected with a BAS3000 phospho-imaging system (Raytest). Activities toward MARK-AR1 were assayed with 2.5 μm recombinant MARK-AR1, and the reaction was followed with a Tecan Safire by a change in the emission ratio of 523 and 476 nm from 1.08 to 1.94 (see Fig. 6, C and D). Inhibitors were used at a final concentration of 5 μm (HD01) and 20 μm (30199 and 39621). For quantification of phosphorylation (see Fig. 6D), an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed every 3 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Recombinant MARK2 (residues 39–365 containing the catalytic domain with N-terminal His tag; 1 unit = 55 nmol/min/mg) was expressed in Escherichia coli as described (13Panneerselvam S. Marx A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Structure. 2006; 14: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A full-length clone of SAD kinase B was obtained from Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH (RZPD, Berlin, Germany) and expressed in Sf9 cells. Final concentrations used were 7.3 nm MARK2-(39–365), 4.3 nm SAD-B, 8.3 nm PKA (Promega), 9.3 nm calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase I (New England Biolabs), 20 nm MAPKAPKII (Invitrogen), 5.3 nm AMPK (α1β1γ1), 4.1 nm ChkI, and 3.8 nm ChkII (all three from Cell Signaling). Data show averages of three experiments (bars = S.E.). MARK2 (7.3 nm) was preincubated for 15 min with 50 μm compound in buffer C (50 mm BES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm NaCl2, 0.03% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm FITC-labeled Tau peptide). The reaction was started by the addition of 40 μm ATP and stopped after 120 min at 25 °C by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. The products were analyzed with a LabChip3000 (CaliperLifeScience). Hits were verified by the same assay by using an assay with radiolabeled ATP as described (17Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and by measuring the dose dependence of the MARK2 activity. Compounds were mixed with matrix solution (10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in water) to give a final concentration of 100 μm, pipetted onto a steel target-plate, and dried in the vacuum. Analysis was performed on a Voyager System 4217 (Applied Biosystems) made available by EMBL in Hamburg. The instrument was run in the linear positive mode with delayed extraction (accelerating voltage, 20,000 V; grid voltage, 94%; extraction delay time, 100 nc). CHO wild type cells or cells stably transfected with hTau40 were grown in Ham's F-12 medium with 10% FCS and incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For stable transfection we added G418 (600 μg/ml, Invitrogen) to the culture medium. Cells were seeded at 70% confluency in 24-well plates (1.8 cm2) on coverslips, and MARK2wt, inactive MARK2 mutants, or MARK-AR1 were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h followed by the addition of compound for 18 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS (3 times). Permeabilization was carried out by adding 80% ice-cold methanol and incubated for 5 min at −20 °C. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and blocked with 10% goat serum at 37 °C for 45 min. After blocking, the cells were treated with HA-tag antibody (1:250, Sigma) for 1 h or overnight at 37 °C and then washed 3 times with PBS. The appropriate Cy3-tagged secondary antibody was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h followed by washing 3 times with PBS. Finally the coverslips were mounted for microscopy and analyzed with a LSM510 Meta confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For quantification of Tau phosphorylated at the KXGS motifs and for the determination of cell shape and size, cells stably transfected with hTau40 were treated as described above and then stained with 12E8 antibody (1:200) for detection of pTau and with YL1/2 for tubulin (1:1000, Serotec). Approximately 100 fields were scanned with a Leica DMI 4000B Metamorph-based microscope using Metamorph scanslide application. ECFP-MARK2wt or ECFP-MARK2A2-transfected cells were selected, and average fluorescence intensities, and cell size were measured using Metamorph software. 12E8 background signals from MARK2A2-transfected cells were subtracted from MARK2wt-transfected cells. 35–45 cells were analyzed for each transfection and treatment. Statistical analysis was done using analysis of variance with post-hoc Dunnett's Multiple Comparisons Test. PC12 cells were grown in a medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 4500 mg/liter glucose, 1% l-glutamine, 10% FCS, 15% HS, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. 2 × 104 cells per coverslip (2 cm2; precoated overnight with poly-d-lysine) were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. MARK-AR1 was transfected by treatment with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h followed by the incubation in growth medium for 18 h. The differentiation of PC12 cells was carried out in differentiation medium (DMEM:F-12 = 1:1) containing 0.1% serum and 100 ng/ml NGF for the depicted period of time. Living or fixed cells were analyzed by fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM). Cortex tissue dissected from E18 rat embryos was digested with 0.05% trypsin for 7 min. Plating medium was added, and cells were allowed to settle and then were resuspended in HBS and mechanically dissociated. Neurons were plated at a density of 100 neurons/mm2 on coverslips (2 cm2) precoated overnight with poly-d-lysine. After culturing for 4 h, the medium was changed to neuronal culture medium (Neurobasal medium with B-27 and l-glutamine), and the cells were grown for 8 days. MARK-AR1 was transfected by treatment with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 1 h followed by incubation in culturing medium for 48 h. Living cells were analyzed by FLIM before and after treatment with compounds. A pulsed diode laser driver PDL 800-B (PicoQuant, Berlin, Germany) was used to drive a picosecond 440-nm diode laser (PicoQuant) to excite the donor (ECFP, mTFP (mono-teal fluorescent protein)) at a rate of 40 MHz. A dual channel SPAD (Single Photon Avalanche Diodes, MPD, Bolzano, Italy) detection unit (PicoQuant) equipped with an emission filter (480/40 nm) was used to detect the emitted photons. Pico Harp 300 (PicoQuant) was applied as the TCSPC (time-correlated single photon counting) instrument. The scan of the image was controlled by an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany). The images were focused using the YFP channel (which is less sensitive to bleaching). To increase the signal to noise ratio, the FLIM data were recorded with a widened pinhole (400 μm). This allowed us to reduce the time of measurement to 30–60 s, which in turn reduced phototoxicity and photobleaching especially during live cell imaging. The reconstruction of time-resolved fluorescence decays and the data analysis were performed using SymphoTime software (PicoQuant). Because of the general similarity of kinase catalytic domains, inhibitors developed against a given kinase often react with other kinases as well. For example, earlier studies (in collaboration with L. Meijer, Roscoff, France; see Ref. 41Meijer L. Thunnissen A.M. White A.W. Garnier M. Nikolic M. Tsai L.H. Walter J. Cleverley K.E. Salinas P.C. Wu Y.Z. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Kim S.H. Pettit G.R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) had shown that some compounds that were initially developed to inhibit proline-directed kinases such as GSK3β, Cdc2, or Cdk5 turned out to be potent inhibitors of MARK. In particular, compound HD01 (developed as an inhibitor of GSK3β) potently inhibits MARK with an IC50 value of 0.67 μm (23Biernat J. Wu Y.Z. Timm T. Zheng-Fischhöfer Q. Mandelkow E. Meijer L. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4013-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Similarly, the GSK3β inhibitors SB-216763 and SB-415286 show cross-reactivity with MARK and its activating kinase MARKK (Ref. 29Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar and own observations). Thus, for a better understanding of the role of MARK during neuronal cell polarity, we sought to develop more specific modifiers of MARK activity, particularly those that distinguish different kinases that phosphorylate Tau. A primary screen was performed with the ChemBioNet compound collection (17951 compounds, Mr 350–500 Da), designed at the Leibniz Institute for Molecular Pharmacology after analysis of the World Drug Index for privileged substructures or scaffolds (30Lisurek M. Rupp B. Wichard J. Neuenschwander M. von Kries J.P. Frank R. Rademann J. Kühne R. Mol. Divers. 2010; 14: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the screening, MARK was incubated with a fluorescence-tagged Tau-derived peptide (20-mer, corresponding to residues 252–271 containing the target Ser-262, with FITC conjugated to the N terminus; Fig. 1B) in the presence or absence of inhibitor compounds in a 384-well format. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA, limiting the turnover of the substrate to one-tenth of the total amount. This was followed by a chip-based analysis of the kinase reaction using a LapChip™3000 system (31Esterman A.L. Cohen S.P. Gen. Eng. News. 2006; 26: 34-36Google Scholar). The charge difference between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides leads to a separation into two peaks (Fig. 1, C and D), which were analyzed quantitatively with the HTS Well AnalyzerTM software (Caliper Life Science). When applying a threshold level of 75% inhibition, 96 hits were found. These potential inhibitors were verified in a second run and characterized by measuring their IC50 values. Among the 96 compounds, 12 exhibited potent inhibition of MARK2, with IC50 values ranging from 0.4 to 10 μm in the presence of 100 μm ATP (for dose-response curves, see Fig. 2A; for IC50 values, see Table 1). All compounds are ATP competitors, as their efficiency declines with increasing concentrations of ATP. By contrast, increasing the concentration of the substrate peptide TR1 did not interfere with inhibition (Fig. 2C). The identities of the 12 substances were confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis.TABLE 1IC50 values of inhibitory compoundsCompound IDIC50 valueμm250004.2262039.4268590.5275380.4300097.8300191.4301951.3301973.5301991.6362773.4396213.6394826.6HD010.7 Open table in a new tab To ascertain the specificity, the compounds were subjected to a test of cross-reactivity with selected kinases that also are known effectors of Tau protein (Fig. 3).

J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar)). Second, SAD kinase B (also known as BRSK1), a close relative of MARK, lies in the same phylogenetic branch of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II group of kinases (15Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6215) Google Scholar) and shows cross-reactivity with some MARK inhibitors (at elevated concentrations; see below and Fig. 2D). The third example of cross-reactivity is seen with MARKK (also known as TAO-1), the activating kinase of all MARK isoforms (17Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). When testing cross-reactivity, we also included Cdc2/cyclin B, Cdk5/p25, and p38/SAPK as representatives of kinases involved in the regulation of important cellular processes capable of phosphorylating Tau at Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. The compounds were tested at a concentration of 50 μm, and most of them exhibited no or very mild inhibition toward MARKK, p38/SAPK, and Cdc2/CycB (except compound 26859), whereas HD01 affected all kinases tested, even MARKK and p38/SAPK (inhibition of 50%). GSK3β was only affected by compounds 25000, 39482, and HD01 (and slightly by compound 39621). In contrast, SAD kinase B (also known as BRSK1) was effectively inhibited by compounds HD01, 27538, 30009, 36277, and 39482 but not by 26203 and 39621. Both compounds turned out to be specific for MARK compared with the other set of kinases tested. The other compounds showed only a mild effect on SAD kinase B activity. Next we tested whether the MARK-selective substances could discriminate between the four MARK isoforms. The dose-response curves for compound 30199 (Fig. 2D) showed inhibition of all MARK isoforms at a low (1.6–3.0) micromolar concentration. By contrast, the IC50 values for SAD-B and AMPK (both relatives of MARK and involved in the regulation of the energy level in cells (32Bright N.J. Thornton C. Carling D. Acta Physiol. (Oxf). 2009; 196: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) were far greater than 30 μm, emphasizing the distinct specificities of these kinases. The compounds 30019, 30195, 30197, and 30199 share a 9-oxo-9H-acridin-10-yl as a functional group (Fig. 4). None of them affected GSK3β, and they showed only little cross-reactivity with SAD-B and AMPK. Therefore, this common functional group structure is a promising basis for optimization of compounds by combinatorial chemistry. The compounds showing low cross-reactivity with other kinases were tested in a cellular assay. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with ECFP-MARK2 and kept in medium for 18 h supplemented either with 10 μm concentrations of inhibitor compounds, compound HD01, or DMSO as a control. As shown previously (5Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), expression of active MARK in CHO cells leads to the disruption of the microtubule network, and subsequently, the cells shrink, round up, and finally die (Fig. 5A). The effect is explained by the destabilization of microtubules after the phosphorylation of MAPs; this can be counteracted by microtubule stabilizers (taxol) or by increasing the effective concentration of MAPs (6Ebneth A. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, in the present experiments, the MARK2-dependent toxicity was rescued by treatment of the cells with the inhibitor 39621 (Fig. 5C), which suppressed MARK2 activity and phosphorylation of MAPs, and thus, prevented microtubule breakdown as shown by almost normal cell size (Fig. 5D) and a reduced level of Tau phosphorylation at KXGS sites (Fig. 5E). As a control, the transfection of an inactive mutant of MARK2 (altered by changing the regulatory loop, T208A/S212A (18Lizcano J.M. Göransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Mäkelä T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar)) had no effect on the microtubule network and toxicity, confirming that the effect was indeed due to phosphorylation by MARK2 (Fig. 5B). Treatment of MARK2-transfected cells with the inhibitors described above revealed that the four compounds with similar structure (30019, 30195, 30197, 30199; Fig. 4) were the most potent ones in protecting the microtubule network along with compound 39621 (Fig. 5, C–E). Compound 26203 (not shown) was highly specific for MARK in the in vitro assay yet rescued the microtubule network in cells only partially, possibly because of its relatively high IC50 value (9.4 μm) or poor cell penetration. The distribution and activity of neuronal signaling molecules is usually not homogeneous, and therefore, we sought to develop a reporter that would reflect the activation state as a function of time and location within living cells. To study the effects of the inhibitors on endogenous levels of MARK in living cells,"

Additionally we determined whether cellular uptake of the nanoparticles resulted in phenotypic changes of cell surface markers.Cellular uptake differed between the four nanoparticle preparations. However for each nanoparticle tested, CD14⁺⁺CD16⁻ monocytes displayed a significantly higher uptake compared to CD14⁺CD16⁺⁺ monocytes, this resulted in significantly lower T1 and T2 relaxation times of these cells. The uptake of iron-oxide nanoparticles further resulted in a remarkable shift of expression of cell surface proteins indicating that the labeling procedure affects the phenotype of CD14⁺CD16⁺⁺ and CD14⁺⁺CD16⁻ monocytes differently.Human monocyte subsets internalize different magnetic nanoparticle preparations differently, resulting in variable loading capacities, imaging phenotypes and likely biological properties."

A biochemical screen of AstraZeneca's compound library using GlmU of Escherichia coli identified novel sulfonamide inhibitors of the acetyltransferase reaction. Steady-state kinetics, ligand-observe NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, and x-ray crystallography showed that the inhibitors were competitive with acetyl-CoA substrate. Iterative chemistry efforts improved biochemical potency against gram-negative isozymes 300-fold and afforded antimicrobial activity against a strain of Haemophilus influenzae lacking its major efflux pump. Inhibition of precursor incorporation into bacterial macromolecules was consistent with the antimicrobial activity being caused by disruption of peptidoglycan and fatty acid biosyntheses. Isolation and characterization of two different resistant mutant strains identified the GlmU acetyltransferase domain as the molecular target. These data, along with x-ray co-crystal structures, confirmed the binding mode of the inhibitors and explained their relative lack of potency against gram-positive GlmU isozymes. This is the first example of antimicrobial compounds mediating their growth inhibitory effects specifically via GlmU."
https://openalex.org/W2000328442,"Background CaM-KIIN has evolved to inhibit stimulated and autonomous activity of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) efficiently, selectively, and potently (IC50 ∼100 nM). The CN class of peptides, derived from the inhibitory region of CaM-KIIN, provides powerful new tools to study CaMKII functions. The goal of this study was to identify the residues required for CaMKII inhibition, and to assess if artificial mutations could further improve the potency achieved during evolution. Methodology/Principal Findings First, the minimal region with full inhibitory potency was identified (CN19) by determining the effect of truncated peptides on CaMKII activity in biochemical assays. Then, individual residues of CN19 were mutated. Most individual Ala substitutions decreased potency of CaMKII inhibition, however, P3A, K13A, and R14A increased potency. Importantly, this initial Ala scan suggested a specific interaction of the region around R11 with the CaMKII substrate binding site, which was exploited for further rational mutagenesis to generate an optimized pseudo-substrate sequence. Indeed, the potency of the optimized peptide CN19o was >250fold improved (IC50 <0.4 nM), and CN19o has characteristics of a tight-binding inhibitor. The selectivity for CaMKII versus CaMKI was similarly improved (to almost 100,000fold for CN19o). A phospho-mimetic S12D mutation decreased potency, indicating potential for regulation by cellular signaling. Consistent with importance of this residue in inhibition, most other S12 mutations also significantly decreased potency, however, mutation to V or Q did not. Conlusions/Significance These results provide improved research tools for studying CaMKII function, and indicate that evolution fine-tuned CaM-KIIN not for maximal potency of CaMKII inhibition, but for lower potency that may be optimal for dynamic regulation of signal transduction."

The study of calcium signals in hIAPP cells demonstrated an absence of response to glucose and also to tolbutamide, indicating a defect in ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. Interestingly, hIAPP showed a greater maximal respiratory capacity than control cells. These data were confirmed by an increased mitochondrial membrane potential in hIAPP cells under glucose stimulation, leading to an elevated reactive oxygen species level as compared with control cells.

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by impaired insulin secretion with a progressive decline in beta-cell mass and function (1Kasuga M. J. Clin.

A main characteristic of type 2 diabetes is the extracellular accumulation of amyloid fibrils in pancreatic islets (3Clark A. Cooper G.J. Lewis C.E. Morris J.F. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. Turner R.C.

In addition, although different studies have demonstrated that IAPP can inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (13Salas M. Silvestre R.A. Garcia-Hermida O. Fontela T.

In pancreatic beta-cells, GSIS depends critically on the activity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP), which serve as a coupling factor between changes in glucose metabolism and membrane electrical activity (16Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 17Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These channels are hetero-octameric complexes comprising four inward-rectifier potassium ion channels (Kir6.2) and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1) (18Seino S. Annu. Rev.

Patch A.M. Mackay D.J. Edghill E.L. Gloyn A.L. Robinson D. Shield J.P. Temple K. Ellard S. Hattersley A.T. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1930-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 20Gloyn A.L.

In pancreatic beta-cells, KATP channel activity is modulated by the ATP/ADP ratio, which largely depends on ATP production by mitochondrial respiratory chain through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In the presence of higher glucose metabolism, and consequently increased levels of ATP, the KATP channels close, resulting in depolarization of the plasma membrane (24Craig T.J. Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This results in the opening of the voltage-gated calcium channel (VCC) and consequently increased concentration of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), provoking the exocytosis of insulin vesicles. Over the last few years, several authors have debated whether soluble IAPP oligomers or amyloid fibrils are toxic species responsible for beta-cell death as recently reviewed in Ref. 25Zraika S. Hull R.L. Verchere C.B. Clark A. Potter K.J. Fraser P.E. Raleigh D.P. Kahn S.E. Diabetologia. 2010; 53: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar. Recently, it has become possible to detect the toxic form of hIAPP oligomers with specific antibodies that do not cross-react with IAPP soluble monomers or amyloid fibrils (26Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Neurology. 2006; 66: S74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 27Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G.

Recently, Zhu et al. (29Zhu T. Wang Y. He B. Zang J. He Q. Zhang W. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2011; 27: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) investigated the effects of extracellular hIAPP treatment on the activation of VCCs, as well as [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion in rat islets. They found that VCCs were inhibited by high concentration of extracellular hIAPP, and they proposed that the reduction of GSIS in hIAPP-treated islets is the result of IAPP inhibition of VCCs (29Zhu T. Wang Y. He B. Zang J. He Q. Zhang W. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2011; 27: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The mechanism was not described, but the authors suggested that it could also be involved in the activity of KATP channels. The main objective of this work is to investigate whether hIAPP overexpression could affect beta-cell function and by which mechanisms. In the present study, we obtained a beta-cell line that stably overexpressed the human IAPP gene (hIAPP cells). At first, we observed that hIAPP overexpression induced the formation of intracellular oligomers and altered beta-cell function. Indeed, hIAPP cells showed a defect in insulin and IAPP secretion in response to glucose. Then, to determine by which mechanism hIAPP alters beta-cell secretory function, we studied the effects of hIAPP overexpression on [Ca2+]i mobilization in response to glucose or sulfonylurea drug and mitochondrial metabolism. The hIAPP and rIAPP transcripts were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using as template the construct described previously (30Gasa R. Gomis R. Casamitjana R. Rivera F. Novials A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E543-E549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or INS1E cells, respectively. The amplified fragments were ligated into the EcoRI and EcoRV sites of pcDNA3 for the construction of pcDNA3-hIAPP and pcDNA3-rIAPP, respectively. The rat pancreatic beta-cell line INS1E was plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm diameter culture dish in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 5 μmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 48 h, the cells were transfected with 10 μg of human IAPP gene plasmid DNA, rIAPP plasmid DNA, or pcDNA3 using Lipofectamine. Two days after transfection, 800 μg/ml Geneticin was added to culture medium. Two weeks later, Geneticin-resistant colonies were picked, and colonies were expanded into stable cell lines in the presence of 200 μg/ml Geneticin. Rat islets were infected by lentivirus construct containing hIAPP cDNA under the control of its own promotor. The hIAPP gene promotor was obtained by digestion of pGL3 plasmids constructs (31Novials A. Mato E. Lucas M. Franco C. Rivas M. Santisteban P. Gomis R. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the cDNA was amplified by PCR using as template; the construct was as described previously (30Gasa R. Gomis R. Casamitjana R. Rivera F. Novials A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E543-E549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pLenti-hIAPP was constructed using the pLenti6/V5 Directional TOPO® cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. pLenti6/UbC/V5-GW/LacZ (pLenti-LacZ) was used as control. Then, virus constructs were co-transfected with ViraPowerTM packaging plasmid mixture: pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSV-G (Invitrogen) into 293FT cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The viral titer was determined by transduction of mPac cells with serial dilutions of the viral supernatant and colony counting after blasticidin selection (10 μg/ml). Islets were obtained from Wistar rats, isolated through collagenase perfusion and Histopaque gradient (Sigma), and cultured as described previously (32Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Infection was performed 24 h after isolation. Briefly, 200 islets were resuspended in 2 ml of culture medium at 5.5 mm glucose containing virus particles at a multiplicity of infection of 600 and Polybrene to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. The next day, the culture medium was refreshed, and islets were maintained in culture during 6 days before insulin secretion studies. Cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for at least 2 h at 4 °C, washed in phosphate buffer and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 4 °C, dehydrated in a graded acetone series, and embedded in epoxy resin (Durcupan). Semithin sections were cut with a glass knife at 1–3 μm and stained with methylene blue. For electron microscopy, ultrathin sections (70–90 nm) were cut on an ultramicrotome (Reichert Ultracut E; Leica) using a diamond knife (Diatome) and collected on 200-mesh copper or gold grids. Staining was performed on drops of 1% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds's lead citrate. Ultrastructural analyses were performed in a Jeol-1010 electron microscope at 80 kV, and images were acquired with a Gatan Bioscan 972 camera. Ultrathin sections for single and double immunostaining were cut and picked up on 200-mesh gold grids and immunolabeled. The sections were first etched on droplets of sodium metaperiodate for 30 min (9Janson J. Ashley R.H. Harrison D. McIntyre S. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and washed in five changes of deionized distilled water. The sections were then incubated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20 mm glycine, and 150 mm NaCl for 30 min to prevent nonspecific binding followed by incubation with the primary antibody anti-oligomer (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit (British BioCell International) gold conjugate (15 nm) diluted 1:25 for 1 h at room temperature. Control sections were treated identically except for omission of the primary antibody. Sections were counterstained for 15 min in uranyl acetate and for 5 min in lead citrate. Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Thereafter, cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The genes were amplified using SYBR Green PCR core reagents (Eurogentec). Real-time PCR was carried with 50 ng of cDNA in a Light Cycler 480 II sequence detection system (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve of each primer set was generated from serial dilutions of cDNA. PCR products were verified using dissociation curve analysis after the run using SDS software (Roche Applied Science). Expression levels were normalized to TATA box-binding protein (TBP) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA and represented in arbitrary units. Cells were fixed with 10% formalin. Then, cells were permeabilized and blocked with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS with 1% BSA, respectively. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with rabbit anti-IAPP (1/100, Biochem), cells were incubated for 1 h with Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1/500; GE Healthcare; red fluorescence). Hoechst 33258 (1/5000; Sigma) was used for nuclear counterstaining. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (DMRB; Leica). Cells or islets were preincubated in HEPES-buffered Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium without glucose for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Then, the medium was substituted by the same medium but supplemented with 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose or 30 mm KCl at 37 °C with 5% CO2. At the end of the experiment, the supernatant was recovered and centrifuged to avoid cell contamination to measure insulin and IAPP release, and cells or islets were extracted with acid-ethanol solution to measure insulin and IAPP content. Insulin and IAPP release and content were determined by insulin ELISA (Mercodia) and amylin ELISA (Millipore), respectively. Cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed by FACS within 1 h on a FACSCalibur with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). FACS gating based on forward and side scatter of 20,000 cells was included for analysis. Annexin V-FITC- and propidium iodide-negative cells were considered as viable, annexin V-FITC-positive cells were considered as early apoptotic, and those positive for both annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide were considered as late apoptotic or dead cells. Before the assay, cells were placed overnight at 2.8 mm glucose. Cells were loaded with 5 μm fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes) for at least 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were placed in a chamber mounted on the microscope stage and perfused at a rate of 1.5 ml/min with a modified Ringer's solution (33Soriano S. Gonzalez A. Marroquí L. Tudurí E. Vieira E.

Calcium records were obtained by imaging intracellular calcium under an inverted epifluorescence microscope as described previously (33Soriano S. Gonzalez A. Marroquí L. Tudurí E. Vieira E.

Fluorescence changes were expressed as the ratio of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm (F340/F380), and the increment of fluorescence (ΔF340/F380) was obtained by subtracting the mean basal fluorescence levels in the absence of stimulus (2.8 mm glucose) from the fluorescence value during the stimulus (16.7 mm glucose, 30 mm KCl, or 100 μm tolbutamide). Before the assay, cells were placed overnight at 2.8 mm glucose. O2 consumption measurements were performed on live cell suspension. Cells were scraped, and approximately three million cells were placed into an oxymeter chamber of an Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros Instruments) in 2 ml of RPMI medium (2.8 mm glucose) at 37 °C and stabilized for at least 10 min without drugs. At first, the O2 consumption was evaluated by raising the glucose concentration in the chamber from 2.8 to 16.7 mm. After recording the respiration in the absence of drugs, the uncoupled respiration was determined in the presence of the ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin (4 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). The maximum respiration of cells induced with 0.5 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, Sigma-Aldrich) was also measured. Prior to the assay, air calibration was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Before the assay, cells were placed overnight in 2.8 mm glucose. Cells were disrupted by passive lysis buffer (Promega). Following a 20-min incubation, extracts were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min) at 4 °C. ATP was measured in duplicate using a luciferin-luciferase bioluminescent assay (Promega). Light emission was recorded for 30 s using a photon-counting luminometer (Turner BioSystems). ATP concentration was obtained by comparison with known standards (0–100 pmol) prepared in parallel with the cell extracts. Cultured cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and resuspended immediately in lysis buffer containing: 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium fluorite, 10% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein content in the lysate was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kits (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (30 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Then, the membranes were blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk, and they were incubated with anti-OXPHOS total antibody (1/500, MitoSciences) or anti-actin antibody (1/1000) before being incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated antibodies (GE Healthcare). Protein bands were revealed by using the ECL chemiluminescence reagents kit (Pierce). Before the assay, cells were placed overnight in 2.8 mm glucose. Δψm was evaluated by raising the glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16.7 mm using a specific probe: rhodamine-123 (Molecular Probes). This indicator dye accumulates in mitochondria in proportion to Δψm. Δψm was monitored using the same imaging system described in Ref. 33Soriano S. Gonzalez A. Marroquí L. Tudurí E. Vieira E.

ROS production was evaluated by raising the glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16.7 mm and using a specific probe: 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes). The fluorescence intensity is proportional to the ROS levels within the cell cytosol and was detected using a fluorometric plate reader at 480/530 nm (Infinite® 200, Tecan).

To investigate the effects of hIAPP overexpression on insulin secretion, a rat pancreatic beta-cell line, INS1E, was stably transfected with hIAPP cDNA (hIAPP cells) or the empty vector (control cells). Overexpression of hIAPP was confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 1A) and immunodetection (Fig. 1B). Three hIAPP-overexpressing clones were compared with the control clone. The hIAPP1 clone showed a lower hIAPP gene expression as compared with the other two clones (Fig. 1A). The overproduction of hIAPP protein was confirmed by immunostaining in the hIAPP3 clone. The hIAPP immunolabeling was observed in the cytoplasm, and the staining intensity was clearly stronger in hIAPP cells than in control cells (Fig. 1B). To study the functionality of our cell clones, we have measured insulin and IAPP secretion in response to glucose. Insulin secretion from control cells at 16.7 mm glucose was increased 11-fold relative to secretion at 2.8 mm glucose, but in hIAPP cells, it was only stimulated 2-fold (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, hIAPP1 cells, which had the lowest hIAPP gene expression, showed a better capacity of insulin release in response to glucose than the two other clones. At 2.8 mm glucose, hIAPP cells showed a greater IAPP secretion relative to control cells (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, in response to glucose, IAPP secretion was affected in the same way as insulin secretion in hIAPP cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 2B). For the continuation of the study, we no longer used the hIAPP1, which had low hIAPP gene expression. As the other two hIAPP clones responded in a similar way to glucose, the following experiments were exclusively carried out in hIAPP3 cells. The defect in insulin secretion observed in hIAPP cells does not appear to be associated with a defect in the VCC activation because exposure of hIAPP cells to KCl induced a strong insulin secretion about 17-fold as in control cells (Fig. 2C). By electronic microscopy, at 2.8 mm glucose, we observed the presence of secretory vesicles associated to the plasmatic membrane in both clones (Fig. 2D, panels a and c). At 16.7 mm glucose, we observed few vesicles in control cells because insulin and IAPP had been already secreted in response to glucose (Fig. 2D, panel b), whereas hIAPP cells showed an accumulation of secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D, panel d). This result supports the existence of the defect of insulin secretion in hIAPP cells in response to glucose. To confirm that defect of capacity of insulin release in hIAPP cells was specific for hIAPP overexpression, we have created another INS1E cell line that stably overexpressed rIAPP. Overexpression of rIAPP was confirmed by real-time PCR, and we observed an increase of rIAPP gene expression of about 1.6 times in rIAPP cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 1C). In rIAPP cells, IAPP protein levels were higher than control and similar to hIAPP cells (Fig. 1D). Insulin secretion from rIAPP cells at 16.7 mm glucose was increased 20-fold relative to secretion at 2.8 mm glucose and was similar to secretion from control cells in the same conditions (Fig. 2A). To confirm our results, we have overexpressed hIAPP gene in rat pancreatic islets by lentiviral transduction. The infection was effective, and hIAPP islets showed a strong hIAPP gene expression (Fig. 3A). We observed that insulin secretion in response to 16.7 mm glucose was decreased in hIAPP-overexpressed islets as compared with control islets (1.57 ± 0.09 versus 2.60 ± 0.26% insulin release expressed as a percentage of insulin content) (Fig. 3B). These data strongly support our results obtained in INS1E cells. The immunogold labeling for oligomers was mostly detected in hIAPP cells as compared with control cells (1.78 ± 0.32 versus 0.53 ± 0.10 gold particle number/μm2) and was reinforced in the cytoplasm in association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, a few oligomer immunogold particles were also observed in insulin granules and close to the plasma membrane in hIAPP cells (Fig. 4). It has been previously suggested that oligomers were the toxic form of IAPP causing the apoptosis of beta-cells (27Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar, 36Meier J.J. Kayed R. Lin C.Y. Gurlo T. Haataja L. Jayasinghe S. Langen R. Glabe C.G. Butler P.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: E1317-E1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In our culture conditions, there was no change in cell death (supplemental Fig. S1) and in the expression of genes involved in ER stress (supplemental Fig. S2) in hIAPP cells as compared with control cells. It is well known that calcium is an essential trigger for the exocytosis of insulin granules. At 2.8 mm glucose, hIAPP cells showed a greater [Ca2+]i than control cells (Fig. 5A). Consistent with a defective insulin secretion, the study of calcium signals demonstrated an absence of response to glucose in hIAPP cells. Although 76.61% of control cells tested (194/201) exhibited a normal Ca2+ mobilization in response to 16.7 mm glucose, none of the hIAPP cells tested were able to respond to glucose (0/192) (Fig. 5B). As we have shown for insulin secretion response, the exposure of hIAPP cells to KCl induced a strong increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the defect that inhibits GSIS must be upstream of VCC activation. Because mitochondria are key determinants in GSIS, we investigated the respiratory capacity of our stable INS1E cell lines. hIAPP cells had the same respiratory rate relative to controls at 2.8 mm, and in response to 16.7 mm glucose stimulation, O2 consumption increased to the same extent in both clones (Fig. 6). After the addition of oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthase, the remaining consumption of oxygen, which represents the endogenous proton leak activity, was identical in both cell lines (Fig. 6). We have also calculated the coupling effici"

However, current technologies commonly used for its evaluation are limited by their reliance on endothelial cell antigen expression and assessment in two dimensions. We set out to establish a widely applicable and unbiased optical sectioning method to enable three dimensional imaging and reconstruction of the renal microvessels based on their luminal filling. The kidneys of subtotally nephrectomized (SNx) rats and their sham-operated counterparts were subjected to either routine two-dimensional immunohistochemistry or the novel technique of fluorescent microangiography (FMA). The latter was achieved by perfusion of the kidney with an agarose suspension of fluorescent polystyrene microspheres followed by optical sectioning of 200 µm thick cross-sections using a confocal microscope. The fluorescent microangiography method enabled the three-dimensional reconstruction of virtual microvascular casts and confirmed a reduction in both glomerular and peritubular capillary density in the kidneys of SNx rats, despite an overall increase in glomerular volume. FMA is an uncomplicated technique for evaluating the renal microvasculature that circumvents many of the limitations imposed by conventional analysis of two-dimensional tissue sections."
https://openalex.org/W2081168830,"In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the lysine acetyltransferase NuA4 has been linked to a host of cellular processes through the acetylation of histone and non-histone targets. To discover proteins regulated by NuA4-dependent acetylation, we performed genome-wide synthetic dosage lethal screens to identify genes whose overexpression is toxic to non-essential NuA4 deletion mutants. The resulting genetic network identified a novel link between NuA4 and septin proteins, a group of highly conserved GTP-binding proteins that function in cytokinesis. We show that acetyltransferase-deficient NuA4 mutants have defects in septin collar formation resulting in the development of elongated buds through the Swe1-dependent morphogenesis checkpoint. We have discovered multiple sites of acetylation on four of the five yeast mitotic septins, Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc12 and Shs1, and determined that NuA4 can acetylate three of the four in vitro. In vivo we find that acetylation levels of both Shs1 and Cdc10 are reduced in a catalytically inactive esa1 mutant. Finally, we determine that cells expressing a Shs1 protein with decreased acetylation in vivo have defects in septin localization that are similar to those observed in NuA4 mutants. These findings provide the first evidence that yeast septin proteins are acetylated and that NuA4 impacts septin dynamics."

Bacteria also encode three classes of ferritin-type molecules with iron accumulation properties.Here, we investigated whether these bacterial ferritins can also be used as MRI reporter genes and which of the bacterial ferritins is the most suitable reporter. Bacterial ferritins were overexpressed in probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. Cultures of these bacteria were analyzed and those generating highest MRI contrast were further investigated in tumor bearing mice. Among members of three classes of bacterial ferritin tested, bacterioferritin showed the most promise as a reporter gene. Although all three proteins accumulated similar amounts of iron when overexpressed individually, bacterioferritin showed the highest contrast change. By site-directed mutagenesis we also show that the heme iron, a unique part of the bacterioferritin molecule, is not critical for MRI contrast change. Tumor-specific induction of bacterioferritin-expression in colonized tumors resulted in contrast changes within the bacteria-colonized tumors.Our data suggest that colonization and gene expression by live vectors expressing bacterioferritin can be monitored by MRI due to contrast changes."

https://openalex.org/W2021383672,"XAP2 (also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein, AIP) is originally identified as a negative regulator of the hepatitis B virus X-associated protein. Recent studies have expanded the range of XAP2 client proteins to include the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. In this study, we show that XAP2 is recruited to the promoter of ERα regulated genes like the breast cancer marker gene pS2 or GREB1 and negatively regulate the expression of these genes in MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, we show that XAP2 downregulates the E2-dependent transcriptional activation in an estrogen receptor (ER) isoform-specific manner: XAP2 inhibits ERα but not ERβ-mediated transcription. Thus, knockdown of intracellular XAP2 levels leads to increased ERα activity. XAP2 proteins, carrying mutations in their primary structures, loose the ability of interacting with ERα and can no longer regulate ER target gene transcription. Taken together, this study shows that XAP2 exerts a negative effect on ERα transcriptional activity and may thus prevent ERα-dependent events."
https://openalex.org/W1966618047,Calcineurin is a calcium-calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine specific protein phosphatase operating in key cellular processes governing responses to extracellular cues. Calcineurin is essential for growth at high temperature and virulence of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans but the underlying mechanism is unknown. We performed a mass spectrometry analysis to identify proteins that associate with the calcineurin A catalytic subunit (Cna1) in C. neoformans cells grown under non-stress and high temperature stress conditions. A novel prioritization strategy for mass spectrometry data from immunoprecipitation experiments identified putative substrates and proteins potentially operating with calcineurin in common pathways. Cna1 co-purified with proteins involved in membrane trafficking including the COPI component Sec28 and the COPII component Sec13. The association of Cna1 with Sec28 and Sec13 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Cna1 exhibited a dramatic change in subcellular localization during high temperature stress from diffuse cytoplasmic to ER-associated puncta and the mother-bud neck and co-localized with Sec28 and Sec13.
https://openalex.org/W2046055422,"In the brain, transporters of the major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate remove their substrate from the synaptic cleft to allow optimal glutamatergic neurotransmission. Their transport cycle consists of two sequential translocation steps, namely cotransport of glutamic acid with three Na+ ions, followed by countertransport of K+. Recent studies, based on several crystal structures of the archeal homologue GltPh, indicate that glutamate translocation occurs by an elevator-like mechanism. The resolution of these structures was not sufficiently high to unambiguously identify the sites of Na+ binding, but functional and computational studies suggest some candidate sites. In the GltPh structure, a conserved aspartate residue (Asp-390) is located adjacent to a conserved tyrosine residue, previously shown to be a molecular determinant of ion selectivity in the brain glutamate transporter GLT-1. In this study, we characterize mutants of Asp-440 of the neuronal transporter EAAC1, which is the counterpart of Asp-390 of GltPh. Except for substitution by glutamate, this residue is functionally irreplaceable. Using biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we conclude that although D440E is intrinsically capable of net flux, this mutant behaves as an exchanger under physiological conditions, due to increased and decreased apparent affinities for Na+ and K+, respectively.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.

Glutamate transporters mediate two types of substrate-induced steady-state current: an inward-rectifying or “coupled” current, reflecting electrogenic ion-coupled glutamate translocation, and an “uncoupled” sodium-dependent current, which is carried by chloride ions and further activated by the substrates of the transporter (11Wadiche J.I.

Nontransportable substrate analogues, expected to “lock” the transporter in an outward-facing conformation when applied from the external side (Fig. 1A, dashed line), are not only competitive inhibitors of the coupled current and of the substrate-induced uncoupled anion current, but also inhibit the basal sodium-dependent anion conductance (14Otis T.S.

Because of the limited resolution of the GltPh structure, Tl+ ions, which exhibit a robust anomalous scattering signal, have been used in an attempt to visualize the sodium sites in this homologue (24Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), which also uses 3 Na+ ions per transported substrate molecule (32Groeneveld M. Slotboom D.J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3511-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Two Tl+ sites were identified. One was found to be buried just under HP2 and seemed to have only four coordinating main chain carbonyl oxygens from TM7 and HP2. The other Tl+ site was buried deeply within the protein, coordinated by three main chain carbonyl oxygens from TM7 and TM8 as well as the two carboxyl oxygens of a conserved TM8 aspartate residue (Asp-405) and possibly a hydroxyl oxygen of a HP1 serine residue (24Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). There is nevertheless, uncertainty on the assumption that Tl+ faithfully reports on Na+ because in contrast to Na+, Tl+ could not support transport (24Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). However, functional evidence supports the role of one of the Tl+ sites as a sodium binding site (33Teichman S. Qu S. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14297-14302Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the absence of high resolution structural data, suggestions for additional sodium binding sites have been searched by using a combination of computational and functional studies (34Tao Z.

This suggests the possibility that the number of sodium sites may be even higher than three. In the past, we have obtained functional evidence that the conserved tyrosine residue, corresponding to Tyr-317 of GltPh, represents a molecular determinant of ion selectivity in the brain glutamate transporter GLT-1 (10Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the GltPh structure, a conserved aspartate residue (Asp-390) is located adjacent to the conserved tyrosine residue (16Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), suggesting the possibility that these two residues could participate together in the formation of a new and as yet unidentified cation binding site. In this study, we characterize mutants of Asp-440 of the neuronal transporter EAAC1, which is the counterpart of Asp-390 of GltPh. We found that only one of the substitution mutants, EAAC1-D440E, exhibited transport activity. The functional characteristics of this mutant are consistent with the possibility that the conserved aspartate and tyrosine residues could be involved in the formation of a novel cation binding site. The C-terminal histidine-tagged versions of rabbit EAAC1 (37Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 38Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Briefly, HeLa cells were plated on 24-well plates and washed with transport medium containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4. Each well was then incubated with 200 μl of transport medium supplemented with 0.4 μCi of the tritium-labeled substrates for 10 min, followed by washing, solubilization of the cells with SDS, and scintillation counting. Solubilization of transporters expressed in the HeLa cells, their reconstitution in proteoliposomes, and transport experiments were done as described (6Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y.

Briefly, 10 μl of proteoliposomes were diluted into 360 μl of 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with 1 μCi of d-[3H]aspartate (11.3 Ci/mmol) or l-[3H]aspartate (12.9 Ci/mmol) and 2.5 μm valinomycin for each triplicate time point. For the experiments depicted in FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, the amount of radioactive substrate was 4 μCi. For the determination of the kinetic parameters for d- and l-aspartate net flux (1 min) the substrate concentration was varied between 0.15 and 6 μm using 0.6 or 4.0 μCi of radioactivity for substrate concentrations below or above 0.5 μm, respectively. Exchange was measured exactly as described (6Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber, penetrated with two agarose-cushioned micropipettes (1%/2 m KCl, resistance varied between 0.5 and 3 mΩ), voltage clamped using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments), and digitized using Digidata 1322 (Axon Instruments) both controlled by the pClamp9.0 suite (Axon Instruments). Voltage jumping was performed using a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (38Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

The standard buffer, termed ND96, was composed of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5. The compositions of other perfusion solutions are indicated in the figure legends. Offset voltages in chloride substitution experiments were avoided by use of an agarose bridge (1%/2 m KCl) that connected the recording chamber to the Ag/AgCl ground electrode. For uptake, four to five oocytes of each mutant were incubated for 20 min in ND96 containing d-[3H]aspartate as described previously (26Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Briefly, 5 oocytes expressing wild type or mutant EAAC1 were treated with 1.5 mg/ml of sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) dissolved in ND96 and the streptavidin beads were eluted with a final volume of 70 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For samples of total cell transporter, 10% of the lysate, before the streptavidin treatment, was run on the same gel as samples eluted from the beads.

Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological recordings were performed 24 h after the transfection for 2 days. The rapid solution exchange (time resolution ∼100–200 ms) was performed by means of a quartz tube (opening 350 μm) positioned at a distance of ≈0.5 mm to the cell. The linear flow rate of the solutions emerging from the opening of the tube was ∼5–10 cm/s. Laser-pulse photolysis experiments were performed as described previously (15Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). 2 mm 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged glutamate (TOCRIS) was applied to the cells and photolysis of the caged glutamate was initiated with a light flash (355 nm Nd:YAG laser, Minilite series, Continuum). The light was coupled into a quartz fiber (diameter 350 μm) that was positioned in front of the cell at a distance of 300 μm. Laser energies were varied in the 50–300 mJ/cm2 range with neutral density filters. With maximum light intensities of 300 mJ/cm2, saturating glutamate concentrations could be released, which was tested by comparison of the steady-state current with that generated by rapid perfusion of the same cell with 1 mm glutamate. Data were recorded using the pClamp6 software (Axon Instruments), digitized with a sampling rate of 25 kHz and low-pass filtered at 3–10 kHz. All current-voltage relationships represent steady-state substrate-elicited net currents ((Ibuffer+substrate) − (Ibuffer)) and were analyzed by Clampfit version 8.2 or 9.0 (Axon Instruments), and the data have been normalized as indicated in the figure legends. Charge movements were quantitated by integrating the current-time relationships using nonsubtracted or subtracted current records as indicated in the figure legends. Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear fitting to the generalized Hill equation using the built-in functions of Origin 6.1 (Microcal). For determination of the apparent affinity for substrate, Imax and K0.5 were allowed to vary and the value of nH was fixed at 1. Origin software was also used to fit the transport current responses to the photolytic release of glutamate. The time constants were obtained by a two-exponential fit of the decaying phases. To test the role of the conserved aspartate residue located at position 440 in EAAC1, we first measured d-[3H]aspartate uptake in HeLa cells expressing mutants where this residue was replaced by glutamate, asparagine, glutamine, serine, or cysteine. As shown in Fig. 2A, none of the mutants tested exhibited significant transport activity, except for D440E, which had activity comparable to that of wild type (EAAC1-WT). Similar results were also obtained by measuring d-[3H]aspartate uptake in oocytes expressing the same mutants (Fig. 2B). To explore the possibility that the lack of transport activity in D440N, D440Q, D440S, and D440C is a consequence of impaired expression at the plasma membrane, we performed cell surface biotinylation in oocytes and found that the biotinylation levels of the Asp-440 mutants were similar or higher than EAAC1-WT (Fig. 2C). The values for the intensity of the transporter bands of the mutants relative to EAAC1-WT (n = 4) were: D440E, 1.46 ± 0.22; D440N, 1.50 ± 0.11; D440S, 1.43 ± 0.03; D440Q, 1.55 ± 0.23 and D440C, 1.96 ± 0.24. The lack of d-[3H]aspartate uptake by the D440N, D440Q, D440S, and D440C mutants could be due to a dramatically increased Km and/or lowered Vmax. To address these possibilities, without the need to use excessive amounts of radioactive substrate, we measured the transport currents in oocytes expressing the Asp-440 mutants in the presence of 96 mm Na+. No measurable currents were induced by any of the three transporter substrates, d-aspartate, l-aspartate, and l-glutamate (tested at concentrations up to 10 mm) in oocytes expressing D440N, D440Q, D440S, or D440C mutants (data not shown). Only the D440E mutant exhibited transport currents induced by each of the three substrates but not by GABA. However, their voltage dependence was remarkably different from those by WT (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). The substrate-induced currents (Fig. 3, right panel, l-Asp-Na+) are defined as the currents obtained in the presence of sodium and the substrate (l-aspartate in the case of Fig. 3, middle panel, l-Asp) minus those in sodium without the substrate (Fig. 3, left panel, Na+). When external Na+ was substituted by choline, substrate-induced currents were neither observed in D440E nor in EAAC1-WT (data not shown).FIGURE 4Substrate-induced steady-state currents by EAAC1-WT and D440E. Steady-state currents induced by a saturating concentration (2 mm) of l-aspartate (squares), l-glutamate (circles), d-aspartate (triangles), or GABA (inverted triangles) are shown. Data obtained from oocytes expressing either EAAC1-WT (A) or D440E (B) in a NaCl-based external medium (ND96), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using the same voltage protocol as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Substrate-induced steady-state currents (Isubstrate − IND96) from 210 to 245 ms at each potential were averaged and normalized to the current induced by l-aspartate at −100 mV (I/Imax). These currents were then plotted against the corresponding membrane potential (Vm (mV)). Data are mean ± S.E. of at least three repeats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the presence of 96 mm Na+, but in the absence of substrate, transient currents were observed in oocytes expressing EAAC1-WT (Fig. 3, Na+). These currents are proposed to reflect charge-moving conformational changes induced by Na+ binding and unbinding from the empty transporter. Upon substrate application, these transient currents were converted into steady-state currents (Fig. 3, l-Asp). The ratio of the charge moved (derived from the “off”-transient currents; jumping back to the holding potential) in the presence of Na+ (area to the right of the vertical line in inset a) to that in the additional presence of l-aspartate (area to the right of the vertical line in the EAAC1-WT counterpart of inset b) was 9.13 ± 1.68 (n = 3). In contrast, little, if any, transient currents were observed in oocytes expressing the D440E mutant using the same conditions as used in the wild-type (Fig. 3, Na+), but, remarkably, now l-aspartate-induced transient currents (Fig. 3, l-Asp) and the above ratio of the charge moved was 0.25 ± 0.02 for D440E (n = 3). Similar transient currents were also induced by d-aspartate and l-glutamate but not by GABA, which is not a substrate of the glutamate transporters (data not shown). The substrate-induced transient currents by D440E are reminiscent of those observed in previously characterized glutamate transporter mutants, locked in the exchange mode. These transient currents apparently reflect sodium-coupled substrate movement through the membrane electric f"
https://openalex.org/W1965846398,"In addition to its complement-regulating activity, CD55 is a ligand of the adhesion class G protein-coupled receptor CD97; however, the relevance of this interaction has remained elusive. We previously showed that mice lacking a functional CD97 gene have increased numbers of granulocytes.Here, we demonstrate that CD55-deficient mice display a comparable phenotype with about two-fold more circulating granulocytes in the blood stream, the marginated pool, and the spleen. This granulocytosis was independent of increased complement activity. Augmented numbers of Gr-1-positive cells in cell cycle in the bone marrow indicated a higher granulopoietic activity in mice lacking either CD55 or CD97. Concomitant with the increase in blood granulocyte numbers, Cd55⁻/⁻ mice challenged with the respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae developed less bacteremia and died later after infection.Collectively, these data suggest that complement-independent interaction of CD55 with CD97 is functionally relevant and involved in granulocyte homeostasis and host defense."
https://openalex.org/W2094251453,"Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), the mitochondrial genome of trypanosomatids, consists of several thousand topologically interlocked DNA circles. Mitochondrial histone H1-like proteins were implicated in the condensation of kDNA into a nucleoid structure in the mitochondrial matrix. However, the mechanism that remodels kDNA, promoting its accessibility to the replication machinery, has not yet been described. Analyses, using yeast two hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, and protein-protein cross-linking, revealed specific protein-protein interactions between the kDNA replication initiator protein universal minicircle sequence-binding protein (UMSBP) and two mitochondrial histone H1-like proteins. Fluorescence and electron microscopy, as well as biochemical analyses, demonstrated that these protein-protein interactions result in the decondensation of kDNA. UMSBP-mediated decondensation rendered the kDNA network accessible to topological decatenation by topoisomerase II, yielding free kDNA minicircle monomers. Hence, UMSBP has the potential capacity to function in vivo in the activation of the prereplication release of minicircles from the network, a key step in kDNA replication, which precedes and enables its replication initiation. These observations demonstrate the prereplication remodeling of a condensed mitochondrial DNA, which is mediated via specific interactions of histone-like proteins with a replication initiator, rather than through their posttranslational covalent modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2094168667,"Background The “good genes” theory of sexual selection postulates that females choose mates that will improve their offspring's fitness through the inheritance of paternal genes. In spite of the attention that this hypothesis has given rise to, the empirical evidence remains sparse, mostly because of the difficulties of controlling for the many environmental factors that may covary with both the paternal phenotype and offspring fitness. Here, we tested the hypothesis that offspring sired by males of a preferred phenotype should have better survival in an endangered bird, the houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata undulata). Methodology/Principal Findings We tested if natural and experimentally-induced variation in courtship display (following an inflammatory challenge) predicts the survival of offspring. Chicks were produced by artificial insemination of females, ensuring that any effect on survival could only arise from the transfer of paternal genes. One hundred and twenty offspring were equipped with radio transmitters, and their survival monitored in the wild for a year. This allowed assessment of the potential benefits of paternal genes in a natural setting, where birds experience the whole range of environmental hazards. Although natural variation in sire courtship display did not predict offspring survival, sires that withstood the inflammatory insult and maintained their courtship activity sired offspring with the best survival upon release. Conclusions This finding is relevant both to enlighten the debate on “good genes” sexual selection and the management of supportive breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2051239587,"UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) is the sole enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid. The product is used in xenobiotic glucuronidation in hepatocytes and in the production of proteoglycans that are involved in promoting normal cellular growth and migration. Overproduction of proteoglycans has been implicated in the progression of certain epithelial cancers, while inhibition of UGDH diminished tumor angiogenesis in vivo. A better understanding of the conformational changes occurring during the UGDH reaction cycle will pave the way for inhibitor design and potential cancer therapeutics.Previously, the substrate-bound of UGDH was determined to be a symmetrical hexamer and this regular symmetry is disrupted on binding the inhibitor, UDP-α-D-xylose. Here, we have solved an alternate crystal structure of human UGDH (hUGDH) in complex with UDP-glucose at 2.8 Å resolution. Surprisingly, the quaternary structure of this substrate-bound protein complex consists of the open homohexamer that was previously observed for inhibitor-bound hUGDH, indicating that this conformation is relevant for deciphering elements of the normal reaction cycle.In all subunits of the present open structure, Thr131 has translocated into the active site occupying the volume vacated by the absent active water and partially disordered NAD+ molecule. This conformation suggests a mechanism by which the enzyme may exchange NADH for NAD+ and repolarize the catalytic water bound to Asp280 while protecting the reaction intermediates. The structure also indicates how the subunits may communicate with each other through two reaction state sensors in this highly cooperative enzyme."

A concentration as low as 15 ng/ml of LPS was detected in distilled water and in reconstituted stools in 10 minutes. In distilled water and in reconstituted stools, an unequivocal positive reaction was obtained with 1.6×10⁶ CFU/ml and 4.9×10⁶ CFU/ml of S. dysenteriae 1, respectively. Optimal conditions to read the test have been determined to limit the risk of ambiguous results due to appearance of a faint yellow test band in some negative samples. The specificity was 100% when tested with a battery of Shigella and unrelated strains in culture. When tested on 328 clinical samples in India, Vietnam, Senegal and France by laboratory technicians and in Democratic Republic of Congo by a field technician, the specificity (312/316) was 98.7% (95% CI:96.6-99.6%) and the sensitivity (11/12) was 91.7% (95% CI:59.8-99.6%). Stool cultures and the immunochromatographic test showed concordant results in 98.4 % of cases (323/328) in comparative studies. Positive and negative predictive values were 73.3% (95% CI:44.8-91.1%) and 99.7% (95% CI:98-100%).The initial findings presented here for a simple dipstick-based test to diagnose S. dysenteriae 1 demonstrates its promising potential to become a powerful tool for case management and epidemiological surveys."

In this study we used the bacterial transcription regulator TRAP as a model system to investigate the features that define the oligomeric state of a circular protein and to question how the subunit number could be manipulated.We find that while Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophilus TRAP form 11-subunit oligomers, the Bacillus halodurans TRAP exclusively forms 12-subunit assemblies. Significantly, the two states of TRAP are related by a simple rigid body rotation of individual subunits around inter-subunit axes. We tested if such a rotation could be induced by insertion or deletion mutations at the subunit interface. Using wild type 11-subunit TRAP, we demonstrate that removal of five C-terminal residues at the outer side of the inter-subunit axis or extension of an amino acid side chain at the opposite, inner side, increased the subunit number from 11 to 12. Our findings are supported by crystal structures of TRAP oligomers and by native mass spectrometry data.The subunit number of the TRAP oligomer can be manipulated by introducing deletion or addition mutations at the subunit interface. An analysis of available and emerging structural data on alternative oligomeric states indicates that the same principles may also apply to the subunit number of other circular assemblies suggesting that the deletion/addition approach could be used generally to engineer transitions between different oligomeric states."
https://openalex.org/W2080889982,"Background This study describes a bioinformatics approach designed to identify Plasmodium vivax proteins potentially involved in reticulocyte invasion. Specifically, different protein training sets were built and tuned based on different biological parameters, such as experimental evidence of secretion and/or involvement in invasion-related processes. A profile-based sequence method supported by hidden Markov models (HMMs) was then used to build classifiers to search for biologically-related proteins. The transcriptional profile of the P. vivax intra-erythrocyte developmental cycle was then screened using these classifiers. Results A bioinformatics methodology for identifying potentially secreted P. vivax proteins was designed using sequence redundancy reduction and probabilistic profiles. This methodology led to identifying a set of 45 proteins that are potentially secreted during the P. vivax intra-erythrocyte development cycle and could be involved in cell invasion. Thirteen of the 45 proteins have already been described as vaccine candidates; there is experimental evidence of protein expression for 7 of the 32 remaining ones, while no previous studies of expression, function or immunology have been carried out for the additional 25. Conclusions The results support the idea that probabilistic techniques like profile HMMs improve similarity searches. Also, different adjustments such as sequence redundancy reduction using Pisces or Cd-Hit allowed data clustering based on rational reproducible measurements. This kind of approach for selecting proteins with specific functions is highly important for supporting large-scale analyses that could aid in the identification of genes encoding potential new target antigens for vaccine development and drug design. The present study has led to targeting 32 proteins for further testing regarding their ability to induce protective immune responses against P. vivax malaria."
https://openalex.org/W1965065949,"Peptides containing the RGD sequence are under continuous investigation given their ability to control cell adhesion and apoptosis. Since small peptides are quickly metabolized and degraded in vivo, developing analogs resistant to serum-induced degradation is a challenging task. RGD analogs developed so far are known as molecules mostly inhibiting cell adhesion; this feature may reduce cell proliferation and tumor development but may not induce regression of tumors or metastases already formed. In the current study, carried out in melanoma in vitro and in vivo models, we show that RAM, an RGD-non-peptide Analog-Molecule, strongly inhibits cells adhesion onto plastic, vitronectin, fibronectin, laminin and von Willebrand Factor while it does not inhibit cell adhesion onto collagen IV, similarly to the RGDS template peptide. It also strongly inhibits in vitro cell proliferation, migration and DNA-synthesis, increases melanoma cells apoptosis and reduces survivin expression. All such effects were observed in collagen IV seeded cells, therefore are most likely independent from the anti adhesive properties. Further, RAM is more stable than the template RGDS; in fact it maintains its anti-proliferation and anti-adhesion effects after long serum exposure while RGDS almost completely loses its effects upon serum exposure. In a mouse metastatic melanoma in vivo model, increasing doses of RAM significantly reduce up to about 80% lung metastases development, while comparable doses of RGDS are less potent. In conclusion these data show that RAM is a potent inhibitor of melanoma growth in vitro, strongly reduces melanoma metastases development in vivo and represents a novel candidate for further in vivo investigations in the cancer treatment field."
https://openalex.org/W1976843786,"Niemann-Pick Disease, type C (NPC) is a fatal, neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorder. It is a rare disease with broad phenotypic spectrum and variable age of onset. These issues make it difficult to develop a universally accepted clinical outcome measure to assess urgently needed therapies. To this end, clinical investigators have defined emerging, disease severity scales. The average time from initial symptom to diagnosis is approximately 4 years. Further, some patients may not travel to specialized clinical centers even after diagnosis. We were therefore interested in investigating whether appropriately trained, community-based assessment of patient records could assist in defining disease progression using clinical severity scores. In this study we evolved a secure, step wise process to show that pre-existing medical records may be correctly assessed by non-clinical practitioners trained to quantify disease progression. Sixty-four undergraduate students at the University of Notre Dame were expertly trained in clinical disease assessment and recognition of major and minor symptoms of NPC. Seven clinical records, randomly selected from a total of thirty seven used to establish a leading clinical severity scale, were correctly assessed to show expected characteristics of linear disease progression. Student assessment of two new records donated by NPC families to our study also revealed linear progression of disease, but both showed accelerated disease progression, relative to the current severity scale, especially at the later stages. Together, these data suggest that college students may be trained in assessment of patient records, and thus provide insight into the natural history of a disease."
https://openalex.org/W2038927265,"Efficient cooperation requires effective coordination of individual contributions to the cooperative behaviour. Most social birds and mammals involved in cooperation produce a range of vocalisations, which may be important in regulating both individual contributions and the combined group effort. Here we investigate the role of a specific call in regulating cooperative sentinel behaviour in pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor). 'Fast-rate chuck' calls are often given by sentinels as they finish guard bouts and may potentially coordinate the rotation of individuals as sentinels, minimising time without a sentinel, or may signal the presence or absence of predators, regulating the onset of the subsequent sentinel bout. We ask (i) when fast-rate chuck calls are given and (ii) what effect they have on the interval between sentinel bouts. Contrary to expectation, we find little evidence that these calls are involved in regulating the pied babbler sentinel system: observations revealed that their utterance is influenced only marginally by wind conditions and not at all by habitat, while observations and experimental playback showed that the giving of these calls has no effect on inter-bout interval. We conclude that pied babblers do not seem to call at the end of a sentinel bout to maximise the efficiency of this cooperative act, but may use vocalisations at this stage to influence more individually driven behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2069589335,"As the first line of host defense, neutrophils are stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines from resting state, facilitating the execution of immunomodulatory functions in activation state. Sulfhydryl modification has a regulatory role in a wide variety of physiological functions through mediation of signaling transductions in various cell types. Recent research suggested that two kinds of sulfhydryl modification, S-nitrosylation by exogenous nitric oxide (NO) and alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), could induce calcium entry through a non-store-operated pathway in resting rat neutrophils and DDT1MF-2 cells, while in active human neutrophils a different process has been observed by us. In the present work, data showed that NEM induced a sharp rising of cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c) without external calcium, followed by a second [Ca2+]c increase with readdition of external calcium in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated human neutrophils. Meanwhile, addition of external calcium did not cause [Ca2+]c change of Ca2+-free PMA-activated neutrophils before application of NEM. These data indicated that NEM could induce believable store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in PMA-activated neutrophils. Besides, we found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a donor of exogenous NO, resulted in believable SOCE in PMA-activated human neutrophils via S-nitrosylation modification. In contrast, NEM and SNP have no effect on [Ca2+]c of resting neutrophils which were performed in suspension. Furthermore, 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, a reliable blocker of SOCE and an inhibitor of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor, evidently abolished SNP and NEM-induced calcium entry at 75 µM, while preventing calcium release in a concentration-dependent manner. Considered together, these results demonstrated that NEM and SNP induced calcium entry through an IP3-sensitive store-operated pathway of human neutrophils via sulfhydryl modification in a PMA-induced activation-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2004458718,"Accumulating genome sequences have revealed the existence of a large number of conserved hypothetical proteins. Characterization of these proteins is considered essential in the elucidation of intracellular biological pathways. Our previous transcriptomic analysis suggested that, in Thermus thermophilus HB8, loss of an oxidized DNA-repairing activity leads to the up-regulation of a function-unknown gene, tthb071, which is conserved in a wide range of bacteria. Interestingly, the tthb071 gene product, TTHB071, showed a significant primary structure similarity to apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases, which are required for the repair of oxidized DNA. In the present study, we observed that disruption of tthb071 increases the H(2)O(2) sensitivity in T. thermophilus HB8, suggesting the involvement of tthb071 in a protection mechanism against oxidative stress. However, purified TTHB071 exhibited no AP endonuclease or DNA-binding activities, indicating that TTHB071 plays no major role in repairing oxidative DNA damage. Then we determined the three-dimensional structure of TTHB071 complexed with zinc ions by x-ray crystallography. In addition to the overall structural similarity, the zinc-binding fashion was almost identical to that of the phosphatase active site of an AP endonuclease, implying that TTHB071 possesses a phosphatase activity. Based on the structural information around the zinc-binding site, we investigated the binding of TTHB071 to 14 different compounds. As a result, TTHB071 favorably bound FMN and pyridoxal phosphate in a zinc ion-mediated manner. Our results suggest that TTHB071 protects the cell from oxidative stress, through controlling the metabolism of FMN, pyridoxal phosphate, or an analogous compound."
