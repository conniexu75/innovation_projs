https://openalex.org/W1992732132,"New applications such as hybrid electric vehicles and power backup require rechargeable batteries that combine high energy density with high charge and discharge rate capability. Using ab initio computational modeling, we identified useful strategies to design higher rate battery electrodes and tested them on lithium nickel manganese oxide [Li(Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 )O 2 ], a safe, inexpensive material that has been thought to have poor intrinsic rate capability. By modifying its crystal structure, we obtained unexpectedly high rate-capability, considerably better than lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2 ), the current battery electrode material of choice."
https://openalex.org/W2049868101,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise 1 to 3% of all vertebrate genes, but their in vivo functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Zebrafish miR-430 is expressed at the onset of zygotic transcription and regulates morphogenesis during early development. By using a microarray approach and in vivo target validation, we find that miR-430 directly regulates several hundred target messenger RNA molecules (mRNAs). Most targets are maternally expressed mRNAs that accumulate in the absence of miR-430. We also show that miR-430 accelerates the deadenylation of target mRNAs. These results suggest that miR-430 facilitates the deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs during early embryogenesis."

Accelerated ice discharge in the west and particularly in the east doubled the ice sheet mass deficit in the last decade from 90 to 220 cubic kilometers per year. As more glaciers accelerate farther north, the contribution of Greenland to sea-level rise will continue to increase."
https://openalex.org/W2128348355,"Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is not always advantageous to engage in thorough conscious deliberation before choosing. On the basis of recent insights into the characteristics of conscious and unconscious thought, we tested the hypothesis that simple choices (such as between different towels or different sets of oven mitts) indeed produce better results after conscious thought, but that choices in complex matters (such as between different houses or different cars) should be left to unconscious thought. Named the “deliberation-without-attention” hypothesis, it was confirmed in four studies on consumer choice, both in the laboratory as well as among actual shoppers, that purchases of complex products were viewed more favorably when decisions had been made in the absence of attentive deliberation."
https://openalex.org/W1996642272,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is a growth factor for T lymphocytes, can also sometimes be inhibitory. Thus, the proliferation of CD8 + T cells in vivo is increased after the injection of a monoclonal antibody that is specific for IL-2 (IL-2 mAb), perhaps reflecting the removal of IL-2–dependent CD4 + T regulatory cells (T regs). Instead, we show here that IL-2 mAb augments the proliferation of CD8 + cells in mice simply by increasing the biological activity of preexisting IL-2 through the formation of immune complexes. When coupled with recombinant IL-2, some IL-2/IL-2 mAb complexes cause massive (&gt;100-fold) expansion of CD8 + cells in vivo, whereas others selectively stimulate CD4 + T regs. Thus, different cytokine-antibody complexes can be used to selectively boost or inhibit the immune response."

https://openalex.org/W2011389660,"In the mammalian nervous system, neuronal activity regulates the strength and number of synapses formed. The genetic program that coordinates this process is poorly understood. We show that myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors suppressed excitatory synapse number in a neuronal activity- and calcineurin-dependent manner as hippocampal neurons formed synapses. In response to increased neuronal activity, calcium influx into neurons induced the activation of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylated and activated MEF2. When activated, MEF2 promoted the transcription of a set of genes, including arc and synGAP , that restrict synapse number. These findings define an activity-dependent transcriptional program that may control synapse number during development."
https://openalex.org/W2013970469,"A network governing DNA integrity was identified in yeast by a global genetic analysis of synthetic fitness or lethality defect (SFL) interactions. Within this network, 16 functional modules or minipathways were defined based on patterns of global SFL interactions. Modules or genes involved in DNA replication, DNA-replication checkpoint (DRC) signaling, and oxidative stress response were identified as the major guardians against lethal spontaneous DNA damage, efficient repair of which requires the functions of the DNA-damage checkpoint signaling and multiple DNA-repair pathways. This genome-wide genetic interaction network also identified novel components (DIA2, NPT1, HST3, HST4, and the CSM1 module) that potentially contribute to mitotic DNA replication and genomic stability and revealed novel functions of well-studied genes (the CTF18 module) in DRC signaling. This network will guide more detailed characterization of mechanisms governing DNA integrity in yeast and other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2021748681,"Lithium is commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, which is associated with altered circadian rhythm. Lithium is a potent inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which regulates circadian rhythm in several organisms. In experiments with cultured cells, we show here that GSK3β phosphorylates and stabilizes the orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erbα, a negative component of the circadian clock. Lithium treatment of cells leads to rapid proteasomal degradation of Rev-erbα and activation of clock gene Bmal1 . A form of Rev-erbα that is insensitive to lithium interferes with the expression of circadian genes. Control of Rev-erbα protein stability is thus a critical component of the peripheral clock and a biological target of lithium therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2044702738,"Postsynaptic differentiation of dendrites is an essential step in synapse formation. We report here a requirement for the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) in the morphogenesis of postsynaptic granule neuron dendritic claws in the cerebellar cortex. A transcriptional repressor form of MEF2A that is sumoylated at lysine-403 promoted dendritic claw differentiation. Activity-dependent calcium signaling induced a calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of MEF2A at serine-408 and, thereby, promoted a switch from sumoylation to acetylation at lysine-403, which led to inhibition of dendritic claw differentiation. Our findings define a mechanism underlying postsynaptic differentiation that may modulate activity-dependent synapse development and plasticity in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2157314261,"We present a technique for simultaneous focusing and energy selection of high-current, mega–electron volt proton beams with the use of radial, transient electric fields (10 7 to 10 10 volts per meter) triggered on the inner walls of a hollow microcylinder by an intense subpicosecond laser pulse. Because of the transient nature of the focusing fields, the proposed method allows selection of a desired range out of the spectrum of the polyenergetic proton beam. This technique addresses current drawbacks of laser-accelerated proton beams, such as their broad spectrum and divergence at the source."
https://openalex.org/W2111175126,"Progerias are rare genetic diseases characterized by premature aging. Several progeroid disorders are caused by mutations that lead to the accumulation of a lipid-modified (farnesylated) form of prelamin A, a protein that contributes to the structural scaffolding for the cell nucleus. In progeria, the accumulation of farnesyl–prelamin A disrupts this scaffolding, leading to misshapen nuclei. Previous studies have shown that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) reverse this cellular abnormality. We tested the efficacy of an FTI (ABT-100) in Zmpste24 -deficient mice, a mouse model of progeria. The FTI-treated mice exhibited improved body weight, grip strength, bone integrity, and percent survival at 20 weeks of age. These results suggest that FTIs may have beneficial effects in humans with progeria."
https://openalex.org/W1980064715,Empirical research with nonhuman primates appears to support the view that causal reasoning is a key cognitive faculty that divides humans from animals. The claim is that animals approximate causal learning using associative processes. The present results cast doubt on that conclusion. Rats made causal inferences in a basic task that taps into core features of causal reasoning without requiring complex physical knowledge. They derived predictions of the outcomes of interventions after passive observational learning of different kinds of causal models. These competencies cannot be explained by current associative theories but are consistent with causal Bayes net theories.
https://openalex.org/W2031502981,"Perilipin A is a key regulator of triacylglycerol storage and hydrolysis in adipocytes; phosphorylation of perilipin A by protein kinase A facilitates maximal lipolysis. Chronic stimulation of lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes causes large perinuclear lipid droplets to fragment into myriad dispersed perilipin A-covered microlipid droplets. In cultured fibroblasts stably expressing ectopic perilipin A, clustered lipid droplets disperse throughout the cytoplasm upon incubation of the cells with forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) to elevate levels of cAMP and activate protein kinase A, mirroring events observed in adipocytes. Furthermore, diethylum-belliferyl phosphate inhibits stimulated lipolysis but not the dispersion of lipid droplets, suggesting that products of lipolysis are not required for this remodeling process. We hypothesized that protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of perilipin A triggers the remodeling of lipid droplets. The mutation of serine 492 of perilipin A to alanine prevented the dispersion of clustered lipid droplets in fibroblasts stably expressing the mutated perilipin upon incubation with forskolin and IBMX. In contrast, the substitution of serines 81, 222, 276, or 433 with alanine, either singly or in combinations, did not affect the protein kinase A-mediated remodeling of lipid droplets. Interestingly, substitution of serines 433, 492, and 517 of perilipin A with glutamic acid residues blocked the dispersion of clustered lipid droplets in cells incubated with forskolin and IBMX, indicating that the addition of a negative charge does not mimic a phosphate group. We conclude that protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of serine 492 of perilipin A drives the fragmentation and dispersion of lipid droplets.

Adipose tissue contains the largest energy reserve in the body, stored as triacylglycerol in the intracellular lipid droplets of adipocytes. Triacylglycerol stores are hydrolyzed to mobilize energy during fasting and extended exercise. Catecholamines bind to β-adrenergic receptors on the plasma membranes of adipocytes to initiate a G-protein-mediated signaling cascade that activates adenylyl cyclase, thus increasing intracellular cAMP levels. Protein kinase A (or cAMP-dependent protein kinase) is then activated and phosphorylates several proteins required for the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol and consequent mobilization of fatty acids. Following phosphorylation by protein kinase A, hormone-sensitive lipase translocates from the cytosol onto lipid droplets (1Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys.

Perilipin A localizes to lipid droplets in adipocytes and plays roles in facilitating both the storage and hydrolysis of triacylglycerol. In adipocytes, two isoforms of perilipin are derived from the alternate splicing of mRNA transcribed from a single gene (10Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc.

Perilipins A and B share a common sequence through the first 405 amino acids of the amino terminus that contains three consensus sequences for protein kinase A; perilipin A has a unique carboxyl terminus with three additional consensus sequences for protein kinase A (10Greenberg A.S.

Confocal Microscopy of Adipocytes—Monolayers of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown in culture medium with 8 μg/ml biotin, and upon reaching confluence, were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by the daily addition of 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm IBMX in fresh culture medium for 3 days, followed by the removal of these agents and the daily addition of fresh culture medium without additives (28Brasaemle D.L.

Six days following the initiation of differentiation, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, released with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA, and seeded into culture dishes containing glass coverslips; cells from one 100-mm culture dish were seeded into three or four new 100-mm dishes. The cells were cultured for 24 h and then incubated in culture medium, either without additives or with 10 μm isoproterenol and 0.5 mm IBMX for 2, 4, or 8 h before fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and prepared for microscopy (29Blanchette-Mackie E.J.

Images of cells were captured in monochrome using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope and processed using a Zeiss LSM image browser. Subcellular Fractionation of Adipocytes on Sucrose Gradients—Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in 100-mm culture dishes were induced to differentiate for 6 days, and adipocytes were then incubated in control medium or medium containing 10 μm isoproterenol and 0.5 mm IBMX for 6 h. Cells were harvested, lysed, and fractionated, as described previously (31Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, post-mitochondrial supernatants were adjusted to 35% sucrose using a solution of 70% sucrose and then layered over 1-ml 50% sucrose cushions. Thereafter, 8 ml of a 0-30% linear sucrose gradient were layered over each sample, and gradients were centrifuged at 154,000 × g in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor for 4 h at 4°C. The floating lipid droplet fractions were collected by slicing off the top portions of the tubes with a Beckman tube slicer. The remainder of each gradient was collected in 1-ml fractions. Proteins from equivalent volumes of each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against perilipin (28Brasaemle D.L.

Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of Perilipin A cDNA Containing Alanine or Glutamic Acid Substitutions for Serines within Protein Kinase A Consensus Sequences— Perilipin A cDNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction with Pfu polymerase and oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding sequence of perilipin A. Point mutations were introduced into the six protein kinase A consensus sequences using internal primers complementary to 20-36 nucleotides flanking and including the sequence encoding each serine; the codon for serine was altered to encode either alanine or glutamic acid. The mutated forms of the perilipin A cDNA were ligated into the unique HindIII site of the pSRαMSVtkneo retroviral expression vector (32Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R.

To increase intracellular levels of cAMP, 10 μm forskolin in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and 0.5 mm IBMX were added to the cells in fresh culture medium. In some experiments, the cells were incubated with 800 μm DEUP added in 0.5% Me2SO without further additions or for 1 h prior to and during incubation with 10 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm IBMX. For each experiment, all cells were incubated with the same concentration of Me2SO. Fluorescence Microscopy of 3T3-L1 Fibroblasts—Control 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and cells expressing perilipin A or a mutated form of perilipin A were cultured on glass coverslips, lipid-loaded overnight, and then incubated in the experimental medium described above prior to fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and preparation for microscopy (29Blanchette-Mackie E.J.

At approximately 10 megabars and approximately 10,000 kelvin, cotunnite-type SiO2 should have thermally activated electron carriers and thus electrical conductivity close to metallic values.

https://openalex.org/W1997611686,"Actin is a major cytoskeletal element and is normally kept cytoplasmic by exportin 6 (Exp6)-driven nuclear export. Here, we show that Exp6 recognizes actin features that are conserved from yeast to human. Surprisingly however, microinjected actin was not exported from Xenopus laevis oocyte nuclei, unless Exp6 was co-injected, indicating that the pathway is inactive in this cell type. Indeed, Exp6 is undetectable in oocytes, but is synthesized from meiotic maturation onwards, which explains how actin export resumes later in embryogenesis. Exp6 thus represents the first example of a strictly developmentally regulated nuclear transport pathway. We asked why Xenopus oocytes lack Exp6 and observed that ectopic application of Exp6 renders the giant oocyte nuclei extremely fragile. This effect correlates with the selective disappearance of a sponge-like intranuclear scaffold of F-actin. These nuclei have a normal G2-phase DNA content in a volume 100,000 times larger than nuclei of somatic cells. Apparently, their mechanical integrity cannot be maintained by chromatin and the associated nuclear matrix, but instead requires an intranuclear actin-scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W2119874753,"Oxidative damage to DNA has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Developmental exposure to lead (Pb) has been shown to elevate the Alzheimer's disease (AD) related beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), which is known to generate reactive oxygen species in the aging brain. This study measures the lifetime cerebral 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (oxo8dG) levels and the activity of the DNA repair enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg1) in rats developmentally exposed to Pb. Oxo8dG was transiently modulated early in life (Postnatal day 5), but was later elevated 20 months after exposure to Pb had ceased, while Ogg1 activity was not altered. Furthermore, an age-dependent loss in the inverse correlation between Ogg1 activity and oxo8dG accumulation was observed. The effect of Pb on oxo8dG levels did not occur if animals were exposed to Pb in old age. These increases in DNA damage occurred in the absence of any Pb-induced changes in copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), manganese-SOD (SOD2), and reduced-form glutathion (GSH). These data suggest that oxidative damage and neurodegeneration in the aging brain could be impacted by the developmental disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2057749981,"Somitogenesis requires bilateral rhythmic segmentation of paraxial mesoderm along the antero-posterior axis. The location of somite segmentation depends on opposing signalling gradients of retinoic acid (generated by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2; Raldh2) anteriorly and fibroblast growth factor (FGF; generated by Fgf8) posteriorly. Retinoic-acid-deficient embryos exhibit somite left-right asymmetry, but it remains unclear how retinoic acid mediates left-right patterning. Here, we demonstrate that retinoic-acid signalling is uniform across the left-right axis and occurs in node ectoderm but not node mesoderm. In Raldh2(-/-) mouse embryos, ectodermal Fgf8 expression encroaches anteriorly into node ectoderm and neural plate, but its expression in presomitic mesoderm is initially unchanged. The late stages of somitogenesis were rescued in Raldh2(-/-) mouse embryos when the maternal diet was supplemented with retinoic acid until only the 6-somite stage, demonstrating that retinoic acid is only needed during node stages. A retinoic-acid-reporter transgene marking the action of maternal retinoic acid in rescued Raldh2(-/-) embryos revealed that the targets of retinoic-acid signalling during somitogenesis are the node ectoderm and the posterior neural plate, not the presomitic mesoderm. Our findings suggest that antagonism of Fgf8 expression by retinoic acid occurs in the ectoderm and that failure of this mechanism generates excessive FGF8 signalling to adjacent mesoderm, resulting initially in smaller somites and then left-right asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2114343361,"The high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), mediates selective cholesteryl ester uptake from lipoproteins into liver and steroidogenic tissues but also cholesterol efflux from macrophages to HDL. Recently, we demonstrated the uptake of HDL particles in SR-BI overexpressing Chinese hamster ovarian cells (ldlA7-SRBI) using ultrasensitive microscopy. In this study we show that this uptake of entire HDL particles is followed by resecretion. After uptake, HDL is localized in endocytic vesicles and organelles en route to the perinuclear area; many HDL-positive compartments were classified as multivesiculated and multilamellated organelles by electron microscopy. By using 125I-labeled HDL, we found that ∼0.8% of the HDL added to the media is taken up by the ldlA7-SRBI cells within 1 h, and almost all HDL is finally resecreted. 125I-Labeled low density lipoprotein showed a very similar association, uptake, and resecretion pattern in ldlA7-SRBI cells that do not express any low density lipoprotein receptor. Moreover, we demonstrate that the process of HDL cell association, uptake, and resecretion occurs in three physiologically relevant cell systems, the liver cell line HepG2, the adrenal cell line Y1BS1, and phorbol myristate acetate-differentiated THP-1 cells as a model for macrophages.

Several other proteins such as ABCA1, which is defective in Tangier disease, a severe HDL deficiency syndrome characterized by accumulation of cholesterol in tissue macrophages, have also been shown to mediate cholesterol efflux (26Lee J.Y.

SR-BI and ABCA1 were reported to have differential and competing roles in HDL cholesterol efflux in macrophages (34Chen W. Silver D.L. Smith J.D. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30794-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In nonpolarized cells, SR-BI promotes the reuptake of cholesterol actively secreted by ABCA1, creating a kind of futile cycle of cholesterol transport (34Chen W. Silver D.L. Smith J.D. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30794-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the precise role and quantitative importance of SR-BI in cholesterol efflux in vivo still remains enigmatic.The retroendocytosis of HDL was first postulated to occur in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (35Bierman E.L. Stein O. Stein Y. Circ. Res. 1974; 35: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), in a process involving receptor-mediated internalization of HDL into endosomal compartments and its subsequent resecretion. 20 years ago, Schmitz et al. (36Schmitz G. Robenek H. Lohmann U. Assmann G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) described the uptake and subsequent resecretion of HDL particles by macrophages using electron microscopy. Several years later, DeLamatre et al. (37DeLamatre J.G. Sarphie T.G. Archibold R.C. Hornick C.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 191-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence for a retroendocytic pathway using iodinated HDL particles in a rat liver cell line. DeLamatre et al. (37DeLamatre J.G. Sarphie T.G. Archibold R.C. Hornick C.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 191-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that HDL particles can transit cells, but the receptor(s) responsible for the uptake and the physiologic consequences remained unknown. Recently, Silver et al. (38Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) described that selective cholesteryl ester uptake mediated by SR-BI is linked to this holo-HDL uptake process. Silver et al. (38Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cholesterol transfer from HDL particles to polarized hepatocytes via SR-BI was accompanied by a transport of HDL particles to the endosomal recycling compartment. This is in contrast to findings of Nieland et al. (39Nieland T.J. Ehrlich M. Krieger M. Kirchhausen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1734: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggesting that endocytosis is not required for selective lipid uptake mediated by SR-BI. Recently, we followed HDL holoparticle uptake in a CHO cell line overexpressing SR-BI via ultrasensitive fluorescence microscopy (40Rhode S. Breuer A. Hesse J. Sonnleitner M. Pagler T.A. Doringer M. Schutz G.J. Stangl H. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 41: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The present study was designed to: 1) analyze HDL holoparticle uptake, its relation to selective uptake, and the role of SR-BI for this uptake process; 2) describe the intracellular trafficking of HDL and LDL during retroendocytosis in more detail; and 3) study the resecretion of HDL and its role for cholesterol efflux.We present evidence that holo-HDL particle uptake facilitated by SR-BI is followed by resecretion in cell lines derived from tissues of central importance in cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, our data indicate that HDL uptake and resecretion may be involved in the efflux of cellular cholesterol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLipoprotein Preparation, Labeling, and Analysis—Plasma was collected from healthy volunteers, and lipoproteins were recovered by serial ultracentrifugation steps as follows: LDL at a density of 1.019 g/ml and HDL at a density of 1.21 g/ml (40Rhode S. Breuer A. Hesse J. Sonnleitner M. Pagler T.A. Doringer M. Schutz G.J. Stangl H. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 41: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The HDL fraction was routinely analyzed for its apolipoprotein content by SDS-gel electrophoresis; no apoE bands were detected after silver staining. The apolipoprotein parts of HDL and LDL were covalently labeled with Alexa647 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or with Cy5 or Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's description (Molecular Probes). Lipoproteins were iodinated with [125I] sodium iodine (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) using the Pierce IODO-BEADS iodination reagent kit as directed by the manufacturer (Pierce). The labeling procedure resulted in a specific activity of the lipoprotein particles between 3000 and 4000 cpm/ng. For the experiments, lipoproteins were diluted with unlabeled lipoprotein to give a specific activity of ∼300 cpm/ng.Resecreted HDL was precipitated from tissue culture media using 12% trichloroacetic acid. To specifically precipitate lipoproteins, a precipitation method using sodium phosphotungstate and MgCl2, according to Burstein et al. (41Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a final concentration of 1.8% phosphotungstate and 180 mm MgCl2 was used.The lipid part of the HDL particles was labeled with the fluorescent phospholipid DiI (Molecular Probes). The labeling procedure included incubation of HDL, diluted in lipoprotein-deficient serum, with DiI overnight at 37 °C followed by ultracentrifugation (42Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain double-labeled Alexa647-DiI HDL particles, the DiI-HDL particles were conjugated with Alexa647 as described above. HDL particles were covalently labeled with peroxidase using a peroxidase labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gold-HDL conjugates were prepared by incubation of HDL with gold colloid (20 nm; Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature as described by Handley et al. (43Handley D.A. Arbeeny C.M. Witte L.D. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HDL was labeled with [3H]cholesteryl-oleate (Amersham Biosciences) by the Celite exchange method as described previously (44Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8141-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To check the integrity of HDL particles after tissue culture experiments, media obtained from association, displacement, and chase experiments were size-fractionated on 4-20% nondenaturing Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Criterion; Bio-Rad) using a constant current of 30 mA for 4 h (37DeLamatre J.G. Sarphie T.G. Archibold R.C. Hornick C.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 191-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were analyzed by autoradiography using the Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager FX. Size analysis was performed using the high molecular weight calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOKI) and CHO cells lacking LDL receptor activity (ldlA7 cells) and expressing high levels of recombinant SR-BI (ldlA7-SRBI) were used (22Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For all experiments cells were plated in 6-well plates at a cell density of 300,000 cells/well in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and Ham's F-12 medium (medium A) with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen). On day 2, cells were switched to medium A containing 5% (v/v) human lipoprotein-deficient serum. On day 3, cells were washed with PBS and refed with medium A supplemented with 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (faf-BSA; Sigma). For inhibitor treatment cells were incubated with 150 μm BLT-4 (Chembridge Corp., San Diego), 500 μm glyburide (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), or 50 μm chloroquine (Sigma) for 15 min before adding 125I-HDL. ldlA7-SRBI-EGFP cells were grown as described by Eckhardt et al. (45Eckhardt E.R. Cai L. Sun B. Webb N.R. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 10% FCS and 2 mm glutamine. Y1BS1 cells, kindly provided by Dr. B. P. Schimmer (University of Toronto, Canada), were grown in medium A supplemented with 2% FCS and 15% horse serum (46Schimmer B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 million cells/well and further treated as described for the CHO cell lines. The human THP-1 monocyte leukemia cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and 2 mm glutamine. For induction of cell differentiation, 2 × 106 cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with 160 nm phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, stock 500 μg/ml in Me2SO; Calbiochem) for 4 days (47Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar). After differentiation, nonattached cells were removed by aspiration, and adherent cells were washed with PBS and used in subsequent experiments.Association Experiments—On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated with 125I-HDL or 125I-LDL at the indicated concentrations in duplicate for 1 h at 37 °C. To estimate the unspecific binding of lipoproteins to the cell surface, cells were incubated with iodinated lipoproteins in the presence of a 40-fold excess of unlabeled lipoprotein. Finally, media were recovered, and the cells were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.9% NaCl and 2 mg/ml BSA (buffer A) and twice with buffer A without BSA. Cells were lysed using 0.1 m NaOH, and radioactivity associated with the lysate and the media was analyzed using a Cobra II gamma counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell protein was estimated using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Specific cell association was calculated in ng of lipoprotein/mg of cell protein by subtracting unspecific binding.Displacement Experiments—To study HDL particle uptake, cells were prepared and incubated as described for association studies. After incubation with iodinated lipoproteins, cells were washed twice with PBS containing 2 mg/ml faf-BSA and twice with PBS without faf-BSA. Cells were then incubated for another 2 h at 0°C in medium A with 2 mg/ml faf-BSA, 10 mm Hepes, and a 100-fold excess of unlabeled lipoprotein to replace all surface-bound 125I-labeled lipoproteins. Finally, the media were collected, and the cells were washed with buffer A and harvested. Specific lipoprotein uptake was calculated in ng of lipoprotein/mg of cell protein by subtraction of unspecific binding.Chase Experiments—To study HDL resecretion, cells were washed after the displacement procedure twice with PBS containing 2 mg/ml faf-BSA and twice with PBS without faf-BSA. Cells were incubated for the indicated time in medium A containing 2 mg/ml faf-BSA and a 20-fold excess of unlabeled lipoprotein at 37 °C. All media were recovered, and cells were washed with buffer A and lysed. The media and cell lysate were analyzed for their content of radiolabel.Degradation Experiments—The media of association, displacement, or chase experiments were recovered, and proteins in the media were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the supernatant was analyzed for degraded lipoproteins (48Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar).Cholesterol Efflux Studies—The day before the experiment, the cellular cholesterol pool was labeled with either [3H]cholesterol (2 μCi; Amersham Biosciences) or [14C]acetate (5 μCi; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The next day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with HDL for the indicated time (22Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the media were removed, and cells were washed and lysed. Media and lysates from cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol were directly analyzed by scintillation counting. For the [14C]acetate-labeled cells, aliquots of the media and cells were analyzed for their [14C]cholesterol content using lipid extraction and TLC separation as described (49Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 50Ho Y.K. Faust J.R. Bilheimer D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 145: 1531-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Cholesterol Transfer Studies—On day 3, cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of HDL labeled with [3H]cholesteryl-oleate for 1 or 5 h with or without the addition of inhibitors (3Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). The cells were then harvested, and lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC (48Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) to determine cellular cholesteryl ester uptake and subsequent hydrolysis of the cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol.Flow Cytometry—Cells were incubated either with 10 μg/ml Alexa647- or Alexa647-/DiI-HDL for 1 h, and an association, displacement, or chase experiment was performed. After the experiment media were discarded, and cells were washed with buffer A and harvested by trypsinization for 1 min. 1% paraformaldehyde was added to stop the reaction and preserve the cells, and cells were further incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed; cells were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and kept at 4 °C. For flow cytometry measurement, 100 μl of cell suspension was diluted in 500 μl of PBS buffer and analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Two laser lines (emission 488 and 635 nm, respectively) were used to detect DiI (at 585 ± 21 nm in FL-2) and Alexa647 (at >670 nm in FL-4).Electron Microscopy—After incubation for periods of 15 and 30 min and 1-3 h in media A with faf-BSA containing HDL colloidal gold conjugates (43Handley D.A. Arbeeny C.M. Witte L.D. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or peroxidase-labeled HDL, cells were prepared for electron microscopic examination. Fixation was performed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4. After an overnight rinse in PBS, cells were postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in Epon. In the case of peroxidase-HDL studies, prior to postfixation, peroxidase activities were visualized by means of the diaminobenzidine reaction (51Pavelka M. Ellinger A. Debbage P. Loewe C. Vetterlein M. Roth J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 555-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were analyzed in a transmission electron microscope. For controls, HDL was omitted from the incubation media; cells were incubated in media either containing the same amount of peroxidase or colloidal gold alone.Ultrasensitive Fluorescence Microscopy—A modified epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200 TV; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used for imaging fluorescence-labeled lipoproteins as described previously (40Rhode S. Breuer A. Hesse J. Sonnleitner M. Pagler T.A. Doringer M. Schutz G.J. Stangl H. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 41: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cy5 was excited with 647 nm light from a krypton laser (Innova 300; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). The 528 nm line of an argon laser (2020 series; Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) was used for Cy3 excitation. Emitted fluorescence was collected using appropriate filter combinations and an oil 100× immersion objective (Plan-Apochromat, NA = 1.4; Zeiss). For two-color measurements, both images were obtained simultaneously by a liquid nitrogen-cooled slow-scan CCD camera (Micro Max 1300-PB; Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Images were analyzed using algorithms implemented in MATLAB (The Math-Works, Natick, MA). The position of isolated fluorescence peaks corresponding to individual particles or endocytosed objects was automatically determined on each image by fitting with a Gaussian intensity profile. From subsequent images single particle trajectories were reconstructed, yielding the mean square displacements (MSD) as a function of the time lag. Diffusion was analyzed according to MSD = 4 D time lag, with D the lateral diffusion constant, directed transport according to MSD=v time lag, with v the average velocity.Statistics—The results are expressed as means ± S.D. Mean values were compared using analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls test.RESULTSHDL Cell Association and Holoparticle Uptake in SR-BI Overexpressing CHO Cells—By using ultrasensitive microscopy, we have shown previously that holo-HDL particle uptake can be observed in CHO cells that lack the LDL receptor and overexpress SR-BI (ldlA7-SRBI) (40Rhode S.

In the present study, time-dependent HDL cell association was reevaluated using 125I-HDL concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μg/ml (Fig. 1A) in these ldlA7-SRBI cells. After an initial i"
https://openalex.org/W2056603219,"Norepinephrine (NE) is widely implicated in opiate withdrawal, but much less is known about its role in opiate-induced locomotion and reward. In mice lacking dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), an enzyme critical for NE synthesis, we found that NE was necessary for morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP; a measure of reward) and locomotion. These deficits were rescued by systemic NE restoration. Viral restoration of DBH expression in the nucleus tractus solitarius, but not in the locus coeruleus, restored CPP for morphine. Morphine-induced locomotion was partially restored by DBH expression in either brain region. These data suggest that NE signaling by the nucleus tractus solitarius is necessary for morphine reward."
https://openalex.org/W2149180603,"Auroras are caused by accelerated charged particles precipitating along magnetic field lines into a planetary atmosphere, the auroral brightness being roughly proportional to the precipitating particle energy flux. The Analyzer of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms experiment on the Mars Express spacecraft has made a detailed study of acceleration processes on the nightside of Mars. We observed accelerated electrons and ions in the deep nightside high-altitude region of Mars that map geographically to interface/cleft regions associated with martian crustal magnetization regions. By integrating electron and ion acceleration energy down to the upper atmosphere, we saw energy fluxes in the range of 1 to 50 milliwatts per square meter per second. These conditions are similar to those producing bright discrete auroras above Earth. Discrete auroras at Mars are therefore expected to be associated with plasma acceleration in diverging magnetic flux tubes above crustal magnetization regions, the auroras being distributed geographically in a complex pattern by the many multipole magnetic field lines extending into space."
https://openalex.org/W1968168813,"Ingestion of blood is required for vector mosquitoes to initiate reproductive cycles determining their role as vectors of devastating human diseases. Nutritional signaling plays a pivotal role in regulating mosquito reproduction. Transcription of yolk protein precursor genes is repressed until mosquitoes take blood. Previously, we have shown that to signal the presence of blood in the gut, mosquitoes utilize the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway. The TOR signaling pathway transduces the amino acid signal activating the major yolk protein precursor gene, vitellogenin (Vg). Here we report the identification of a GATA factor (AaGATAa) that is synthesized after a blood meal and acts as a transcriptional activator of Vg. We showed that AaGATAa bound specifically to GATA-binding sites present in the proximal promoter region of the Vg gene and positively regulated Vg expression in transfection assays. RNA interference-mediated knock down of AaGATAa transcript resulted in a significant inhibition of Vg expression in both fat-body tissue culture and blood-fed mosquitoes. AaGATAa mRNA accumulated in the fat body prior to blood feeding. However, translation of GATA was activated by blood feeding because the GATA protein increased dramatically in the fat body of blood-fed mosquitoes. This increase was also reproduced in the fat-body culture stimulated with amino acids. GATA translation was inhibited by rapamycin and cycloheximide as well as by RNA interference-mediated knock down of S6 kinase. These experiments have revealed that the TOR signaling pathway induced by nutritional signaling regulates the translation of a GATA factor, which is the specific transcriptional activator of the Vg gene."
https://openalex.org/W2051238269,"The semisynthetic plant alkaloid halofuginone (HAL) was reported to prevent and partly reverse experimental liver fibrosis. However, its mechanisms of action are poorly understood. We therefore aimed to determine the antifibrotic potential of HAL and to characterize involved signal transduction pathways in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Results were compared with its in vivo effects in a rat model of reversal of established liver fibrosis induced by thioacetamide. In vitro HAL inhibited HSC proliferation and migration dose dependently at submicromolar concentrations. HAL (200 nm) up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-13 expression between 10- and 50-fold, resulting in a 2- to 3-fold increase of interstitial collagenase activity. Procollagen α1(I) and MMP-2 transcript levels were suppressed 2- to 3-fold, whereas expression of other profibrogenic mRNAs remained unaffected. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and nuclear factor κB(NFκB) pathways were activated by HAL, and specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK and NFκB dose dependently inhibited MMP-13 induction. Treatment with HAL did not affect HSC viability, and observed effects were reversible after its removal. In vivo HAL up-regulated MMP-3 and -13 mRNA expression 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively, in cirrhotic rats, whereas tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was suppressed by 50%. In conclusion, submicromolar concentrations of HAL inhibit HSC proliferation and migration and up-regulate their expression of fibrolytic MMP-3 and -13 via activation of p38 MAPK and NFκB. The remarkable induction of MMP-3 and -13 makes HAL a promising agent for antifibrotic combination therapies.

Liver cirrhosis as a consequence of many forms of chronic liver diseases is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Treatment for advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis is unsatisfactory or inefficient. Thus, there is an urgent need for antifibrotic treatments that can prevent, halt, or even reverse advanced fibrosis. In recent years, significant progress has been made in our understanding of hepatic fibrosis as a dynamic process, characterized by an imbalance between collagen production and degradation, finally leading to distortion of normal hepatic architecture and loss of function (1McCrudden R.

In hepatic fibrosis the excessive extracellular matrix is produced by activated mesenchymal cells which resemble myofibroblasts and derive from quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 4The abbreviations used are: HSC, hepatic stellate cell; HAL, halofuginone; IκB-α, inhibitory κB-α protein; MF, myofibroblast-like cell; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; APMA, 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; TAA, thioacetamide; HYP, hydroxyproline; TIMP-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.4The abbreviations used are: HSC, hepatic stellate cell; HAL, halofuginone; IκB-α, inhibitory κB-α protein; MF, myofibroblast-like cell; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; APMA, 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; TAA, thioacetamide; HYP, hydroxyproline; TIMP-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. and periportal or perivenular fibroblasts (7Reeves H.L.

Halofuginone (HAL), a semisynthetic quinazolinone alkaloid originally derived from the plant Dichroa febrifuga, has been used to prevent coccidiosis in poultry, when its antifibrotic properties were discovered accidentally, since skin tearing and loss of skin integrity were observed in broilers that received HAL in the diet (10Granot I. Bartov I. Plavnik I. Wax E. Hurwitz S. Pines M. Poult. Sci. 1991; 70: 1559-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). During the last decade HAL was investigated as an antifibrotic agent in various in vivo fibrosis models (reviewed in Ref. 11Pines M. Nagler A. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 30: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and suggested to be a specific inhibitor of procollagen type I expression for various collagen-expressing cells (12Granot I.

Alexiev R. Nagler A. Avni Y. Pines M. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of procollagen I synthesis alone can hardly explain the ability of HAL to reverse pre-established fibrosis in rats. So far, there exist no experimental studies that explain the mode of action of HAL in hepatic fibrosis and, especially, toward the hepatic fibrogenic effector cells, i.e. activated HSCs and myofibroblasts. Here we present an extensive analysis of the in vitro antifibrotic potential of HAL, study the signal transduction pathways triggered by the drug in HSCs/myofibroblasts, and provide in vivo evidence of its pro-fibrolytic mode of action in a rat model of fibrosis reversal. We show that HAL is a prominent activator of fibrolytic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and -13 in HSCs, a hitherto unique property for an antifibrotic agent, which is mediated by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB(NFκB). HSC Isolation and Culture—CFSC-2G (17Greenwel P. Rubin J. Schwartz M. Hertzberg E.L. Rojkind M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 210-216PubMed Google Scholar), HSC line obtained from cirrhotic rat liver (kind gift from Dr. M. Rojkind, Washington, D. C.) and culture-activated primary rat HSCs were seeded onto 12-, 24-, or 96-well plastic plates at a density 40,000 cells per ml at 95% air/5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and used for experiments at low (0.5% FCS) serum conditions after 12–24 h unless specified otherwise. HAL (kind gift of Dr. M. Pines, Rehovot, Israel) was added directly to the culture medium. All reagents were from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany) if not stated otherwise. Primary HSCs were isolated from male Wistar rats (Retired Breeders, 450–500 g, Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) according to a previously published procedure (18Niki T. Rombouts K. De Bleser P. De Smet K. Rogiers V. Schuppan D. Yoshida M. Gabbiani G. Geerts A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was perfused with 0.1% Pronase E and 0.025% type IV collagenase in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 10–15 min, followed by digestion with 0.04% Pronase, 0.025% collagenase, and 0.002% DNase at 37 °C for 10–30 min and by a two-step centrifugation through a 11 and 13% gradient of Nycodenz at 1,500 × g for 15 min. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan Blue exclusion and was routinely greater than 95–98%. Purity of HSC isolates was confirmed by their stellate shape, and cytoplasmic lipid-droplets showing greenish autofluorescence at 390 nm excitation. Contamination with Kupffer cells, as assessed by the ability to engulf 3-μm latex beads, was <3–5% after isolation and undetectable after the first passage. Cells were used freshly or after the first passage if not stated otherwise. Myofibroblast-like cells (MF) were obtained by outgrowth from primary HSC cultures (three to fifth passages). Cell Proliferation—DNA synthesis was evaluated measuring BrdUrd incorporation using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). CFSC-2G and culture-activated primary HSCs (5–7 days) were seeded at a density of 2,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in growth medium containing 10% FCS for 24 h. After 24 h of starvation in 0.25% FCS, cells were stimulated by 10% FCS for 24 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of HAL. BrdUrd was added during the last 4 h, and its incorporation was quantified using an anti-BrdUrd peroxidase-labeled antibody. All experiments were done with 6–8 wells in parallel and repeated at least three times. For determination of cell numbers cells were seeded at 40,000 cells/well in 6-well plates and maintained in growth medium for 24 h followed by different periods of treatment in triplicates. After trypsinization cell numbers were determined with a Coulter counter (Coulter® Z1, Coulter Electronics Ltd., Luton, UK). Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was assessed by measuring the repopulation of a linear wound made in a confluent cell monolayer. Cells were grown in 24-well plates until confluency and starved in serum-free medium for 24 h. Thereafter a linear wound was generated in the monolayer by scraping a sterile 100-μl plastic pipette tip perpendicular to three parallel drawn lines, and medium was changed to remove scraped cells. After 3 h, the distance between the cell fronts was measured with a micrometer, using the three lines as a reference. 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) or 10% FCS and HAL at increasing concentrations were immediately added, and migration was assessed during the following 12–24 h. Three measurements per well were performed in three wells for each condition, and data are expressed as a reduction of initial scratch width. Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was performed as described (19Popov Y. Patsenker E. Fickert P. Trauner M. Schuppan D. J.

Briefly, total RNA was isolated from the cell lysates or liver homogenates using RNApure (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany) and 0.5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 50 pmol of random hexamer and 100 pmol of oligo(dT) primers (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Relative mRNA transcript levels were quantified on a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using the TaqMan technology. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was amplified in a parallel reaction for normalization. TaqMan probes and primer sets were designed using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) based on published sequences as summarized in Table 1. All TaqMan probes are positioned such as spanning exon-exon boundaries of corresponding genes to exclude co-amplification of genomic DNA. Sense and antisense primer (each at 0.5 μm) and 0.125 μm probe, labeled and phosphorylated at its 5′-end with 6-carboxyfluoresceine (6-FAM™) and at the 3′-end with tetramethylrhodamine, were synthesized at MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) and validated using conventional RT-PCR and agarose chromatography (20Benten D. Kumaran V. Joseph B. Schattenberg J. Popov Y. Schuppan D. Gupta S. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

Pro-MMP-13 (60 kDa) from conditioned media of rat keratinocytes (CCL-4 cells) served as positive control (MMP-13 antigen and anti-MMP-13 antibody from Lab Vision, Westinghouse, CA; rabbit anti-human MMP-3 from AnaSpec, San Jose, CA). Conditioned media and cell lysates were standardized by equal cell numbers and volume of media (1 × 106cells/ml). Equal loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of membranes after protein transfer and/or concomitant blotting for β-actin. Interstitial Collagenase Activity Assay—Conditioned media were activated with 2 μm 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate (APMA) at 37 °C for 5 h to measure total interstitial collagenase activity using degradation of native bovine biotinylated type I collagen as substrate (ECM710, Chemicon, Hampshire, UK). 100 μl of APMA-activated conditioned media was incubated with substrate for 2 h at 37 °C, and solubilized biotinylated fragments were transferred to a biotin-binding 96-well plate followed by streptavidin-peroxidase detection according to the manufacturer's recommendations. APMA-activated human recombinant MMP-1 was used as a standard. Determination of NFκB Activation—Cells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks, grown until confluence, starved in serum-free medium for 24 h, and treated with HAL at 200 nm for various periods of time. After centrifugation in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and 1200 rpm for 5 min, 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (5 mm HEPES-KOH, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 7.9), incubated for 10 min, and vortexed for 1 min. Nuclei were collected at 1200 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of cell lysis buffer (see MAPK activation assay below), boiled for 10 min under reducing conditions, and frozen at –20 °C until use. The p65-subunit was detected in nuclear extracts by Western blotting (see MAPK activation assay) using an anti-p65 antibody (1:200, from Delta Biolabs). Inhibitory κB protein (IκB-α) degradation was assessed by Western blotting using anti-IκBα antibody (1:1000, from Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA) in CFSC-2G cell lysates 30 min obtained after addition of HAL. For immunofluorescence, subconfluent cells were starved in 0.25% FCS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h and treated with 200 nm HAL for 0.5–6 h, washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer, and fixed in cold methanol for 10 min. p65 NFκB was detected by incubating with the anti-p65 antibody (1:100) for 30 min followed by TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Dako, Germany). Subcellular localization of p65 was assessed, and representative images were documented using a scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). To inhibit NFκB nuclear translocation (23Hellerbrand C. Jobin C. Iimuro Y. Licato L. Sartor R.B. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1285-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Rockland Inc.) was used. MAPK Activation Assays—Confluent, starved cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 10 min with or without pretreatment with HAL for 4 h. Cell extracts were prepared on ice using cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Tween 20, 0.25% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF) and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), boiled for 10 min under reducing conditions, and frozen at –20 °C until use. To inhibit activation of individual kinases, several specific inhibitors were used: SB203580 (p38 MAPK), U0126 (Erk1/2), and LY294002 (PI3K) (all from LC Labs, Woburn, MA). Total and phosphorylated MAPKs, Akt-1, and phospho-CREB were visualized by Western blotting using respective antibodies recognizing phosphorylated and total kinases (from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). 10 μg of cell lysates standardized by cell number was run on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and stained with 0.5% Ponceau S to assure equal protein loading and transfer. Membranes were blocked with 5% powdered milk in TBS-T (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 144 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, washed, and incubated for 2 h with their corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunodetected proteins were visualized utilizing the enhanced chemiluminescence assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Animal Experimentation—48 male Wistar rats (300–330 g) were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The protocol for animal experimentation was approved by the Government of Lower Franconia (permission number 621.2531.31-20/00). Cirrhosis was induced in 40 rats by intraperitoneal administration of thioacetamide (TAA) dissolved in saline, 200 mg/kg twice a week, for 12 weeks. Four rats died during induction and were not included in the study, and eight rats which received saline instead of TAA served as controls. After 12 weeks of TAA treatment, cirrhotic rats were randomly divided into three groups: PF (peak of fibrosis, n = 12), SR (spontaneous recovery, n = 12), and HAL (SR and treatment with HAL, n = 12). Group PF was sacrificed 5 days after the last TAA injection, and the HAL group received halofuginone (0.05 mg/kg), dissolved in 3% carboxymethylcellulose, by daily oral gavage for the following 8 weeks, while the SR group received equal amounts of vehicle for 8 weeks. Thereafter animals were sacrificed, and fibrosis parameters were evaluated. Total (milligrams/liver) and relative (milligrams/g of liver) hydroxyproline (HYP) was determined biochemically from 250 mg of liver as described previously (19Popov Y. Patsenker E. Fickert P.

Relative mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR from total RNA, extracted from liver homogenates (∼100 mg of tissue) as described above. Histological staining for connective tissue (Sirius Red) was performed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver specimens from two different lobes of each animal according to the routine protocol of Department of Pathology, University of Erlangen. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft EXCEL software. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences was evaluated using the unpaired, non-parametric Student's t test. Halofuginone Inhibits Hepatic Stellate Cell Proliferation and Migration—HAL dose dependently inhibited serum-stimulated cell proliferation as measured by BrdUrd incorporation, with a maximal inhibition at 200 nm in both CFSC-2G and primary rat HSCs (Fig. 1, A and B). Inhibition of DNA synthesis was consistent with reduction in cell number (Fig. 1C). The effect of HAL on serum-induced migration of HSCs, as measured in an in vitro wounding assay, was completely blocked in the presence of 100 nm HAL, with significant inhibition already at 10 nm (Fig. 1D). PDGF-BB-induced migration was inhibited similarly (not shown). Cell morphology, as visualized by phase-contrast microscopy, and cell viability, as assessed by Trypan Blue exclusion, were not affected by HAL. Moreover, the antiproliferative effect of 200 nm HAL added for 24 h was readily reversible after removal of the drug (Fig. 1E). Halofuginone Affects Expression of Fibrolytic Genes in HSCs—In CFSC-2G cells 200 nm HAL strongly up-regulated MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression between 10- and 50-fold (Fig. 2, A and B). MMP-13 mRNA was maximal at 12 h after addition and slowly declined to basal levels after 36 h (Fig. 2A), whereas MMP-3 mRNA peaked at 36 h (Fig. 2B). In freshly isolated, early culture-activated HSCs (≤14 days) MMP-13 mRNA was almost undetectable in both untreated and HAL-treated cells (data not shown), whereas HAL induced MMP-3 mRNA 6-fold at 36 h (Fig. 2C), similar to its effect in CFSC-2G cells. Myofibroblasts obtained by outgrowth from long term cultured primary HSCs were found to be positive for MMP-13 mRNA. Here, HAL up-regulated MMP-3 and -13 mRNAs 12- and 19-fold, respectively, after 36 h of treatment (Fig. 2, D and E). Western blotting of concentrated CFSC-2G conditioned media and cell lysates confirmed an increase in (pro-) MMP-3 and -13 protein expression, respectively, upon treatment with HAL (Fig. 2, F and G). In CFSC cells and culture-activated HSCs, HAL down-regulated procollagen α1(I) and MMP-2 transcripts 2- and 3-fold, respectively, within 24 and 36 h (Fig. 3, A–D). Similar results were obtained for myofibroblasts (not shown). These findings confirm previous observations by others in avian fibroblasts and a rat HSC line for procollagen α1(I) (12Granot I. Halevy O. Hurwitz S. Pines M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1156: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Bruck R. Genina O. Aeed H. Alexiev R. Nagler A. Avni Y. Pines M. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and in bladder carcinoma cells for MMP-2 (25Elkin M. Reich R. Nagler A. Aingorn E. Pines M. de-Groot N. Hochberg A. Vlodavsky I. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1982-1988PubMed Google Scholar). Procollagen α1(III) expression was suppressed similarly as procollagen α1(I) mRNA, whereas transforming growth factor β1, CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), and TIMP-1 and -2 transcript levels remained unaffected in both CFSC-2G cells and primary HSCs (data not shown). Halofuginone Stimulates Collagenolytic Activity of HSCs—Total (APMA-activated) collagenolytic activity was measured in conditioned media of myofibroblasts, obtained by outgrowth from primary HSCs. HAL enhanced degradation of native collagen type I by hepatic myofibroblasts in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with a 2- to 3-fold increase by 200 nm HAL after 12–18 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Intrinsic (without APMA activation) collagenolytic activity was below the detection limit of our system (not shown). Halofuginone Acts via Activation of p38 MAPK and NFκB—To explore the mechanisms that lead to MMP-3 and MMP-13 induction by HAL, we studied activation of several MAPKs and NFκB. Incubation of cells with HAL alone without subsequent stimulation by PDGF-BB did not modulate phosphorylation of kinases as compared with untreated controls (not shown). However, stimulation of the cells with 10 ng of PDGF for 10 min after preincubation with 200 nm HAL for 2 h induced a strong increase of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, without a change of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation as compared with cells, stimulated with PDGF-BB alone (Fig. 5A). Activation of SAPK/JNK or PI3K/Akt was unaffected by HAL (not shown). In addition, HAL caused a time-dependent increase of nuclear p65-NFκB compared with untreated controls as detected by semiquantitative Western blot (Fig. 5B). Anti-p65 immunohistochemistry on CFSC-2G cells exposed to 200 nm HAL confirmed nuclear translocation of p65 already at 1 h and peaking at 6 h. p65 nuclear translocation was abrogated by pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5C). This was preceded by degradation of IκB-α at 30 min (Fig. 6D).FIGURE 6p38 MAPK and NFκB are causally involved in the induction of MMP-13 in HSCs. A, lack of effect of the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126 (U, 5 μg/ml) and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY, 5 μg/ml), in contrast to complete abrogation of MMP-13 induction by SB203580 (SB, 5 μg/ml) and MG132 (MG, 15 μg/ml). Cells were treated with 200 nm HAL for 12 h 30 min after addition of inhibitors in 0.5% FCS Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. B, Western blots demonstrating efficient and specific inhibition of respective kinases by preincubation with inhibitors at doses as used in Fig. 6A. Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 10 min and analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Total p38 MAPK served as a loading control. C, inhibition of activation of p38 MAPK (upper band) and its downstream target phospho-CREB (middle band) by SB203580 in CFSC-2G cells in the presence of 0.5% FCS and 200 nm HAL.

https://openalex.org/W2122144011,"Recent evidence indicates that growth hormone (GH) is involved in liver regeneration. To test whether insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mediates this effect, we studied liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy in liver-specific IGF type 1 receptor knockout (LIGFREKO) mice. The absence of IGF-1R caused a significant decrease in hepatocyte proliferation in males (-52%), but not in females, as assessed by Ki67 immunohistochemistry. Cyclin D1 and cyclin A protein levels in the livers of LIGFREKO males were only half those in controls, indicating that cyclin induction during liver regeneration is dependent on IGF-1R signaling. Analyzing the signaling cascade initiated by IGF-1R, we observed a lack of IRS-1 induction in LIGFREKO livers. In contrast, the induction of IRS-2 synthesis was similar in LIGFREKO and control groups, suggesting the existence of differential regulation of IRS synthesis during liver regeneration. Regenerating livers from LIGFREKO animals also showed significantly less activated ERKs than controls. Our findings demonstrate that IGF-1R makes a significant contribution to liver regeneration. Using the LIGFREKO model, we provide new evidence that IGF-1R/IRS-1/ERK signaling may be the intracellular pathway controlling the cell cycle via cyclin D1 and cyclin A in the regenerating liver."
https://openalex.org/W2132984871,"CodY is a global regulator of transcription in Gram-positive bacteria. It represses during growth genes required for adaptation to nutrient limitation, including virulence genes in some human pathogens. CodY activity is regulated by GTP and branched chain amino acids, metabolites whose intracellular concentrations drop as cells enter stationary phase. Although CodY has a highly conserved sequence, it has no significant similarity to proteins of known structure. Here we report crystal structures of two fragments of CodY from Bacillus subtilis that clearly constitute its cofactor and DNA binding domains and reveal that CodY is a chimera of previously observed folding units. The N-terminal cofactor-binding fragment adopts a fold reminiscent of the GAF domains found in cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and adenylate cyclases. It is a dimer stabilized by an intermolecular six α-helical bundle that buries an extensive apolar surface rich in residues invariant in CodY orthologues. The branched chain amino acid ligands reside in hydrophobic pockets of each monomer distal to the dimer-forming surface. The structure of the C-terminal DNA binding domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family. The implications of the structure for DNA binding by CodY and its control by cofactor binding are discussed. CodY is a global regulator of transcription in Gram-positive bacteria. It represses during growth genes required for adaptation to nutrient limitation, including virulence genes in some human pathogens.

The structure of the C-terminal DNA binding domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family. The implications of the structure for DNA binding by CodY and its control by cofactor binding are discussed. The chromosomes of bacteria are packed with genes that enable the organism to exploit diverse ecological niches and to survive adversity. The key to adaptation and survival is to interpret indicators of a changing environment and respond by modulating the repertoire of genes being expressed. A fundamental challenge to survival is posed by the depletion of nutrients and the onset of starvation. Bacillus subtilis has at its disposal an array of adaptations to poor growth conditions, including secretion of macromolecule-degrading enzymes to scavenge what nutrients are available, synthesis and secretion of antibiotics that allow more effective competition for these nutrients, motility to seek new sources of nutrients, development of competence to take up exogenous DNA (which may confer a genetic advantage), or, in extreme circumstances, abandoning growth altogether and forming a dormant spore. CodY was first discovered as a repressor of the dipeptide permease operon in B. subtilis (1Slack F. Serror P. Joyce E. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Subsequently it has been recognized as having a much wider role in controlling the expression of stationary phase genes. It is now known to regulate over 100 genes distributed across some 70 or so operons (2Molle V. Nakaura Y. Shivers R.P. Yamaguchi H. Losick R. Fujita Y. Sonenshein A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The CodY regulon encodes extracellular degradative enzymes, transporter proteins, catabolic enzymes, factors involved in genetic competence, antibiotic synthesis pathways, chemotaxis proteins, and sporulation proteins. During rapid growth, CodY thus represses genes whose products allow adaptation to nutrient depletion. The repressor function of CodY is activated by two different effectors, GTP and isoleucine or valine, which may be viewed as sensors of the energetic and metabolic status of the cell, respectively (3Ratnayake-Lecamwasam M. Seror P. Wong K.W. Sonenshein A.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 4Guédon E. Serror P. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Delorme C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Shivers R.P. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These co-repressors act independently and additively to increase the affinity of CodY for its target sites on DNA. CodY binds its ligands selectively but with moderate affinities (in the millimolar range), consistent with its need to monitor the concentrations of GTP and isoleucine/valine obtaining in rapidly growing cells. CodY is highly conserved in the low G + C Gram-positive bacteria. In Lactococcus lactis, CodY regulates the expression of genes encoding extracellular peptidases, peptide transport proteins, and intracellular enzymes involved in peptide and amino acid utilization (4Guédon E. Serror P. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Delorme C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus anthracis, and Clostridium difficile, accumulating evidence points to a role for CodY in the regulation of virulence gene expression (6Sonenshein A.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). CodY from B. subtilis is a dimer of 29-kDa subunits. Its 259-amino acid residue sequence is unrelated to that of any proteins other than CodY orthologues. A putative helix-turn-helix (HTH) 3The abbreviations used are: HTH, helix-turn-helix; BCAA, branched chain amino acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; SeMet, selenium methionine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PDE-2A, phosphodiesterase 2A; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate). motif has been identified close to the C terminus of the protein and specific residues in this motif are required for high affinity DNA binding (7Serror P. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Joseph P. Ratnayake-Lecamwasam M. Sonenshein A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4127-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The only other clue to structure provided by the sequence is a set of possible GTP binding motifs again located in the C-terminal half of the molecule (3Ratnayake-Lecamwasam M. Seror P. Wong K.W. Sonenshein A.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To investigate the structural basis of GTP- and branched chain amino acid (BCAA)-dependent regulation of stationary phase gene expression, we embarked on crystallographic studies of CodY. Although we have been able to crystallize the intact protein (9Blagova E.V. Levdikov V.M. Tachikawa K. Sonenshein A.L. Wilkinson A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the crystals were weakly diffracting and unsuitable for structure determination. We therefore sought to identify stable proteolytic fragments of CodY as alternative targets for structure determination. Here we report the crystal structures of N- and C-terminal fragments constituting residues 1-155 and 168-259, respectively. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—CodY was purified as a C-terminal histidine-tagged protein (9Blagova E.V. Levdikov V.M. Tachikawa K. Sonenshein A.L. Wilkinson A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and partially digested with a series of proteases. Mass spectrometry of the digestion products led us to conclude that a region containing a cluster of 12 highly charged residues (156-167) was particularly sensitive to proteolysis. Using ligation-independent cloning methods, we prepared pET28a derivative constructs encoding CodY fragments spanning residues 1-155 and 168-259, each with an N-terminal His6 tag. The recombinant CodY fragments were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by (i) Ni2+-chelation chromatography on a 5-ml high-performance chelating-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel ions and (ii) gel filtration chromatography. For CodY-(1-155) a HiLoad Superdex 200 preparation grade column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride was used. For CodY-(168-259) a Superdex 75 preparation grade column equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 200 mm sodium chloride was used. SeMet derivatives were prepared by growth of E. coli B834 cells harboring the expression plasmids in ZYP-5052 autoinduction medium (10Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Crystals of CodY-(1-155) were grown in hanging drops containing a 1:1 volume ratio of 20 mg ml-1 protein in gel filtration buffer and 18% monomethyl ethyl polyethylene glycol 5000 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 m calcium acetate, 10 mm Gpp(NH)p, and either 10 mm isoleucine (native protein) or 10 mm valine (SeMet protein). Crystals of CodY-(168-259) were grown similarly from 1:1 mixtures of 20 mg ml-1 protein in 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.2 m NaCl and 32% saturated ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 5% glycerol, and 5% Tacsimate (Hampton Research). Partial Proteolysis of CodY—CodY-His6 protein (84 μg, purified as described above) or bovine serum albumin, Fraction V (BSA; 84 μg; Serologicals Products, Inc.), were preincubated at 25 °C for 10 min with or without BCAAs (10 mm each of isoleucine, leucine, and valine). We then added trypsin (0.26μg, Sigma) orα-chymotrypsin (0.52μg, Sigma) and incubated the samples at 25 °C in 0.12 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA (for trypsin) or 2 mm CaCl2 (for α-chymotrypsin). After various times, 0.01-ml samples were removed, denatured, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to sheets of nitrocellulose. Bands that stained with Coomassie Blue were excised from the nitrocellulose and subjected to N-terminal sequencing by successive Edman degradation by the Tufts Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Facility. Structure Determination—Native data taken from crystals of CodY-(1-155) to 1.7-Å resolution were collected on beamline 10.1 (λ = 0.9800 Å) at the SRS (Daresbury, UK), using a MAR Research CCD165 detector. Three-wavelength CodY-(1-155) SeMet data were collected to 2.3-Å resolution at beamline BM14 at the ESRF (Grenoble, France). Data were processed and scaled using the program HKL2000 (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals were assigned to space group P21212 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by MAD phasing using the program HKL2MAP (12Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar). The model was built using the program ARP/WARP (13Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) with manual refitting in the program COOT (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and refined with REFMAC (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The electron density maps were of excellent quality and all 155 CodY residues of the single molecule in the asymmetric unit of the crystal were defined together with an isoleucine ligand and 175 solvent molecules. The final free R factor is 21.2%, Rwork is 15.3%, and the root mean square deviations of bond lengths and bond angles from ideal geometry are small (Table 1).TABLE 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionCodY N-terminal fragment (1-155)CrystalNativeSeMet peakSeMet inflection pointSeMet remoteX-ray source10.1, SRSBM14, ESRFBM14, ESRFBM14, ESRFWavelength (Å)0.980000.979120.979250.97505Resolution range (Å)50.00-1.7030.00-2.3030.00-2.3030.00-2.30Space groupP21212P21212P21212P21212Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 34.72, b = 86.10, c = 54.85a = 34.69, b = 84.85, c = 54.93a = 34.69, b = 84.85, c = 54.93a = 34.69, b = 84.85, c = 54.93Unique reflections, overall/outeraThe outer shell corresponds to 1.73-1.70 Å for Native and 2.38 - 2.30 Å for SeMet data.16,841/2757,646/6727,636/6277,615/627Completeness (%), overall/outer shellaThe outer shell corresponds to 1.73-1.70 Å for Native and 2.38 - 2.30 Å for SeMet data.88.6/29.2 (97.4% up to 1.8 Å)99.0/92.298.2/84.798.1/85.0Redundancy, overall/outer shellaThe outer shell corresponds to 1.73-1.70 Å for Native and 2.38 - 2.30 Å for SeMet data.3.6/1.76.1/4.26.1/3.96.3/4.0I/σ(I), overall/outer shellaThe outer shell corresponds to 1.73-1.70 Å for Native and 2.38 - 2.30 Å for SeMet data.20.2/1.913.7/4.515.3/3.015.1/2.7RmergebRmerge=∑hkl∑i|Ii-〈I〉|/∑hkl∑i〈I〉, where Ii is the intensity of the ith measurement of a reflection with indexes hkl and <I> is the statistically weighted average reflection intensity.(%), overall/outer shellaThe outer shell corresponds to 1.73-1.70 Å for Native and 2.38 - 2.30 Å for SeMet data.6.1/27.010.4/36.19.2/43.99.3/46.5Refinement and model statisticsResolution range (Å)20.00-1.8027.72-2.30R factorcRfactor=∑||Fo|-|Fc||/∑|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The crystals of CodY-(168-259) were in space group P422. The crystals were weakly scattering and the x-ray diffraction data were limited to 2.8-3.0 Å spacing. The structure was solved using three wavelength MAD data and the model was built and refined as described above. The model contains a complete A chain and all but residues 234-235 and 257-259 in chains B and C. The temperature factors of chain C are significantly higher than for chains A and B. The final free R factor is 24.8%, Rwork is 20.0% and the geometry is satisfactory (Table 1). Tertiary Structure of CodY-(1-155)—CodY-(1-155) has a three-layered globular structure. At the base of the molecule, as shown in Fig. 1A, is a three-helix bundle. Two of the helices are at the N terminus of the chain, whereas the third is at the C terminus of the chain. Helices α2 and α5 pack against a central 5-stranded anti-parallel β-pleated sheet, with a strand order β2-β1-β5-β4-β3 (Fig. 1, A and B). The top layer, which does not lend itself to such simple description, is formed by two extended loops that connect strands β2 and β3, and β3 and β4. The β2-β3 segment contains two α-helices α3 and α4, whereas the β2-β3 loop lacks any recognizable secondary structure. These loops form the walls of a cavity whose base is formed by the β-sheet itself. Amino Acid Binding—The electron density maps clearly define the presence of an isoleucine ligand consistent with the inclusion of this amino acid in the crystallization drops (Fig. 1D). No evidence for the binding of the GTP analogue, Gpp(NH)p was seen, however. The isoleucine is bound above the β-sheet in such a way that the β2-β3 and β3-β4 loops effectively clasp the ligand. The isobutyl group of the ligand projects downwards toward the sheet so that it is enclosed in a hydrophobic cavity circumscribed by the side chains of Met62, Met65, Phe71, Pro72, Tyr75, and Pro99 (Fig. 1E) and main chain atoms from residues 97-99. Valine binds to CodY in a very similar manner to isoleucine, the only significant difference in binding is caused by the absence of a methylene group in valine relative to isoleucine, which may be associated with a small rotation of the phenyl ring of Phe71 (Fig. 1F). The α-amino and α-carboxylate groups of the amino acid ligand form polar interactions with the protein and solvent. The former forms charge-dipole interactions with the main chain carbonyl groups of Thr96 and Phe98 and a further hydrogen bond to the surface water molecule WAT24. The carboxylate group forms a two-pronged ion-pairing interaction with the guanidinium group of Arg61 and further polar interactions with the amide group of Val100 and the water molecule WAT143. The residues making up the isoleucine-binding pocket are strongly conserved in the Bacillus, Listeria, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus spp., although surprisingly they are less well conserved in the Clostridium spp. (Fig. 2). Arg61, which binds the ligand carboxylate, is replaced by apolar side chains in CodY from C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens, whereas the apolar Met65, which contacts the apolar side chain of the ligand, is replaced by Glu or Lys in these species. This suggests differences in the mode of ligand binding. Quaternary Structure—Analysis of the molecular packing suggests an obvious dimer consistent with observations made from gel filtration of CodY-(1-155) during purification, and with the knowledge that intact CodY is a dimer (9Blagova E.V. Levdikov V.M. Tachikawa K. Sonenshein A.L. Wilkinson A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 4K. Matsuno and A. L. Sonenshein, unpublished data. In this dimer, the subunits are related by a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis. Intermolecular contacts are mediated principally through the first and the lastα-helices of the respective domains (Fig. 3). These helices come together to form a four-helix bundle that is extended to a six-helix bundle by the adjacent helices α2 from the respective subunits (Fig. 3). Each subunit contributes ∼1050 Å2 of its surface area to the contact interface, corresponding to 13% of the total accessible surface area and typical of a dimer interface (16Argos P. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Highly conserved and/or invariant residues among CodY orthologues cluster at the dimer interface. There are two intermolecular salt bridges formed between the pairs of Arg8 and Glu144 residues, which engage in two-pronged interactions with each other. These interactions would appear to be crucial for CodY structure and/or function as both residues are invariant in the CodY orthologues (Fig. 2). There is an additional pair of hydrogen bonding interactions between Gln15 and Thr148, the former residue being strongly conserved whereas the latter is invariant. In the dimer, the isoleucine ligands of the respective subunits are distal to the dimer interface and their Cα atoms are separated by 57 Å (Fig. 3). The C-terminal Arg155 residues that in the intact protein are connected to the DNA binding domains are close in space. CodY Has a GAF Domain—Despite the absence of any substantial sequence homology, a number of structures in the Protein Data Bank contain domains that can be superimposed onto CodY-(1-155) to yield positional root mean squared deviations of 2.5-4.0 Å for 80-120 matching Cα atoms (17Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 123-138Crossref Scopus (3566) Google Scholar, 18Ho Y.-W.J. Burden L.M. Hurley J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 20: 5288-5299Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The shared characteristic of these proteins is a GAF domain, named after its discovery, on the basis of sequence analysis, in cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterases, adenylate cyclases and a bacterial transcription regulator FhlA (19Avarind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). It is now recognized that GAF domains are present in numerous signaling and sensory proteins. The structure of the GAF domain was first defined in a study of the yeast protein YKG9 (Protein Data Bank entry code 1f5m (18Ho Y.-W.J. Burden L.M. Hurley J.H.

The superposition of CodY and YKG9 shows clearly that CodY belongs to the GAF domain family (Fig. 4, A and B). The β-sheet and two of the α-helices that pack against it are superimposable in all GAF domain proteins, with family members distinguished by differences in the loops connecting β-strands on the face of the sheet distal to these helices. In the ligand-responsive members of the family (20Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.-B. Turley S. Hol W.G.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), these loops shape the binding pocket. Structure of the C-terminal Domain—CodY-(168-259) has a compact globular structure with an anti-parallel β-sheet of topology β6-β8-β7 and five α-helices arranged with respect to the strands in the order α6-α7-β6-α8-α9-β7-β8-α10 (Fig. 1C). Helices α8 and α9 correspond to the predicted helix-turn-helix spanning residues 203-226. The sequence in this region is exceptionally highly conserved in the CodY orthologous set (Fig. 2). The role of this HTH in DNA binding has been established by site-directed mutagenesis studies, which have shown that non-conservative substitutions of Ala207, Arg214, Ser215, and Val218 dramatically lower the affinity of CodY for ilvB and dpp promoter DNAs (8Joseph P. Ratnayake-Lecamwasam M. Sonenshein A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4127-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The structure presented here shows that the side chains of Arg214, Ser215, and Val218 are situated at the beginning of the putative recognition helix with their side chains pointing outwards from the molecule, consistent with a role in DNA recognition. Ala207 resides on the preceding helix at a position where a small side chain would be required if the HTH helices are to be arranged in the current manner. Structural comparisons reveal that the DNA binding domain of CodY belongs to the winged HTH family of nucleic acid-binding proteins (17Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 123-138Crossref Scopus (3566) Google Scholar, 22Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). These domains consist of three α-helices (α7, α8, and α9 in CodY) packing against a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The so-called “wings,” W1 and W2, are constituted by the loop connecting the second and third strands (β7-β8) and a looping segment following the third strand (β8), respectively. In three dimensions, these segments flank the second helix of the HTH apparently like the wings of a butterfly. BCAA-induced Conformational Change—Because crystals prepared in the absence of BCAAs did not diffract well, we sought an alternative way of testing whether interaction with BCAAs induces a conformational change in CodY. We observed that trypsin has a preferred cleavage site after Lys169. Cleavage at other lysine and arginine residues also occurs, albeit with much lower efficiency (Fig. 5A). In the presence of branched chain amino acids, the major cleavage site was unchanged but none of the minor sites was recognized by trypsin (Fig. 5B). Isolation of each of the bands in Fig. 5A allowed us to determine the N-terminal sequence of each fragment and thereby deduce the sites of cleavage. Based on this analysis, we determined that BCAAs had no effect on cleavage after Lys169, but almost completely inhibited cleavage at Lys64, Arg69, Arg130, and Arg156. As a control, we showed that the cleavage pattern of CodY was not affected by threonine or methionine (data not shown) and that cleavage of BSA was the same in the presence or absence of BCAAs (Fig. 5, C and D). Incubation of CodY with α-chymotrypsin yielded at least seven fragments (Fig. 5E). Of these, only cleavages after Tyr51, after Phe80, and near Tyr181 occurr"
https://openalex.org/W2140740343,"Many cognate low molecular weight (LMW) agonists bind to seven transmembrane-spanning receptors within their transmembrane helices (TMHs). The thienopyrimidine org41841 was identified previously as an agonist for the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) and suggested to bind within its TMHs because it did not compete for LH binding to the LHCGR ectodomain. Because of its high homology with LHCGR, we predicted that thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) might be activated by org41841 also. We show that org41841 is a partial agonist for TSHR but with lower potency than for LHCGR. Analysis of three-dimensional molecular models of TSHR and LHCGR predicted a binding pocket for org41841 in common clefts between TMHs 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and extracellular loop 2 in both receptors. Evidence for this binding pocket was obtained in signaling studies with chimeric receptors that exhibited improved responses to org41841. Furthermore, a key receptor-ligand interaction between the highly conserved negatively charged E3.37 and the amino group of org41841 predicted by docking of the ligand into the three-dimensional TSHR model was experimentally confirmed. These findings provide the first evidence that, in contrast to the ectodomain binding of cognate ligands, a LMW agonist can bind to and activate glycoprotein hormone receptors via interaction with their transmembrane domain."

We have determined the 1.7 angstrom-resolution structure of the sulfur oxygenase reductase from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus ambivalens, which catalyzes an oxygen-dependent disproportionation of elemental sulfur. Twenty-four monomers form a large hollow sphere enclosing a positively charged nanocompartment. Apolar channels provide access for linear sulfur species. A cysteine persulfide and a low-potential mononuclear non-heme iron site ligated by a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad in a pocket of each subunit constitute the active sites, accessible from the inside of the sphere. The iron is likely the site of both sulfur oxidation and sulfur reduction."

Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that Prox1 strongly and specifically interacted with hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4α, an important transactivator of the human CYP7A1 gene in bile acid synthesis and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene in gluconeogenesis. A real time PCR assay detected Prox1 mRNA expression in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. Reporter assay, GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and yeast two-hybrid assays identified a specific interaction between the N-terminal LXXLL motif of Prox1 and the activation function 2 domain of HNF4α. Prox1 strongly inhibited HNF4α and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α co-activation of the CYP7A1 and PEPCK genes. Knock down of the endogenous Prox1 by small interfering RNA resulted in significant increase of CYP7A1 and PEPCK mRNA expression and the rate of bile acid synthesis in HepG2 cells. These results suggest that Prox1 is a novel co-regulator of HNF4α that may play a key role in the regulation of bile acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver.

Front Biosci. 1998; 3: d176-d193Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate absorption, transport and distribution of sterols and lipid-soluble vitamins, and disposal of toxic metabolites and xenobiotics. Bile acid synthesis and CYP7A1 gene transcription is feedback inhibited by bile acids returning to the liver via enterohepatic circulation of bile (1Chiang J.Y. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: d176-d193Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified farnesoid X receptor (NR1H4) as a bile acid-activated receptor that induces an atypical nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2), which interacts with FTF (NR5A2) and HNF4α (NR2A1) bound to an overlapping sequence located in the bile acid response element II (–144/–126) and represses CYP7A1 gene transcription (2Stroup D. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which FTF and HNF4α regulate the CYP7A1 gene is not completely understood. HNF4α is the most abundant nuclear receptor expressed in the liver and is involved in early liver development (3Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474PubMed Google Scholar). Conditional knock-out of the HNF4α gene in mouse liver caused accumulation of lipids in the liver, markedly reduced serum cholesterol and triglycerides, and increased serum bile acids (4Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). CYP7A1, Na+-taurocholate co-transport peptide, organic anion transporter 1, apolipoprotein B100, and scavenger receptor B-1 expression are reduced in these mice (4Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). It appears that HNF4α is a key regulator of bile acid and lipoprotein metabolism and plays a central role in lipid homeostasis (5Sladek R. Giguere V. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 23-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HNF4α is involved in diabetes; mutation of the HNF4α gene causes maturity onset diabetes of the young type 1 (MODY1) (6Navas M.A. Munoz-Elias E.J. Kim J. Shih D. Stoffel M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HNF4α regulates the HNF1α gene, a MODY 3 gene (7Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors are largely dependent on ligand binding and activation. Nuclear receptors interact with co-regulators and regulate their target genes in a tissue- and gene-specific manner (8Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the helix 12 of nuclear receptor is exposed and binds to the co-activators and activates nuclear receptor activity. Recently, PGC-1α has been identified as a co-activator of HNF4α (9Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is highly induced during starvation by glucocorticoids and glucagon to induce PEPCK, a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis (10Chakravarty K. Cassuto H. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PGC-1α co-activates HNF4α and induces CYP7A1 gene transcription during starvation in mice (11Shin D.J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that bile acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis may be coordinately regulated in fasted-to-fed cycle (12De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Gilardi F. Caruso D. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39124-39132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our recent study (13Song K.H. Chiang J.Y. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) shows that glucagon and cAMP inhibit CYP7A1 by inducing phosphorylation of HNF4α. Prox1 has recently been identified as a co-repressor of FTF/LRH-1 by yeast two-hybrid screening (14Steffensen K.R. Holter E. Bavner A. Nilsson M. Pelto-Huikko M. Tomarev S. Treuter E.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2424-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Prox1 was originally cloned by homology to the Drosophila melanogaster gene prospero (16Oliver G. Sosa-Pineda B. Geisendorf S. Spana E.P. Doe C.Q. Gruss P. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Prox1 is expressed in lens, heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and central nervous system (16Oliver G. Sosa-Pineda B. Geisendorf S. Spana E.P. Doe C.Q. Gruss P. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 17Zinovieva R.D. Duncan M.K. Johnson T.R. Torres R. Polymeropoulos M.H. Tomarev S.I. Genomics. 1996; 35: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have linked Prox1 function to lens and lymphatic system development (18Wigle J.T. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Oliver G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 19Wigle J.T. Oliver G. Cell. 1999; 98: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). More recent studies (20Sosa-Pineda B. Wigle J.T. Oliver G. Nat.

Dev. 2002; 118: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) indicate that Prox1 is required for hepatocyte migration in developing liver and pancreas in the mammalian foregut endoderm. Prox1 interacts with the NR5 subfamily of nuclear receptors including Ff1b (NR5A4), a zebrafish homologue of nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1) (22Liu Y.W. Gao W. Teh H.L. Tan J.H. Chan W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7243-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and FTF (14Steffensen K.R. Holter E. Bavner A. Nilsson M. Pelto-Huikko M. Tomarev S. Treuter E.

We hypothesized that Prox1 may interact with HNF4α and suppressed CYP7A1 gene transcription. To test this hypothesis, we used yeast two-hybrid assay to study the interaction between Prox1 and HNF4α and studied the effect of Prox1 on the HNF4α transactivation of the human CYP7A1 gene. Our findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for Prox1 inhibition of bile acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Cell Culture—Primary human hepatocytes were isolated from human donors (HH1201, 69-year-old male; HH1205, 45-year-old male; HH1209 50-year-old female; HH1234, 56-year-old male; HH1247, 3-year-old male; HH1248, 42-year-old female) and were obtained from the Liver Tissue Procurement and Distribution System of National Institutes of Health (S. Strom, University of Pittsburgh, PA). The HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained as described previously (13Song K.H. Chiang J.Y. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The mammalian expression plasmids for HNF4α, Nur77, PGC-1α, Flag-Prox1, Gal4-HNF4α, pHNF4α-tk-Luc reporter, NurRE-Luc, 5× upsteam activating sequence-Luc and human CYP7A1 promoter luciferase reporters were as described previously (14Steffensen K.R.

Human PEPCK promoter luciferase reporter was generously provided by Dr. Richard Hanson (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). The various deletion constructs of Prox1 (Prox1-NT-WT, amino acids 1–312; Prox1-NT-MT, amino acids 1–312, alanine mutations were introduced to convert LRKLL (amino acids 70–74) to ARKAL; Prox1-Homeo (amino acids 313–736)) and HNF4α (HNF4α-NT, amino acids 1–128; HNF4α-LBD, amino acids 129–455; HNF4α-ΔAF2, amino acids 1–352) were made by PCR with suitable restriction endonucleases and inserted into the pcDNA3-HA or the yeast LexA or B42 expression vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). For bacterial expression, GST-fused Prox1 was constructed by inserting EcoRI-XhoI fragments of Prox1 from B42-Prox1 into pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). All the clones were confirmed by sequencing analysis. GST Pull-down Assay—[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were prepared by in vitro translation using the TnT-coupled transcriptional translation system with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega). GST-fused Prox1 (GST-Prox1) was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). In vitro protein-protein interaction assays were carried out as described (23Song K.H. Park Y.Y. Park K.C. Hong C.Y. Park J.H. Shong M. Lee K. Choi H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1929-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—The cell extracts of human primary hepatocytes were precleared with whole rabbit serum adsorbed on Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation with 10 μg of anti-HNF4α or non-immune serum (IgG) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed several times with ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na+-deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm ethylendiamine tetraacetic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF), and the immune complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting (Amersham Biosciences) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prox1 and HNF4α proteins were detected by incubation of blots with an anti-Prox1 antibody (1:2000 dilution; Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) and anti-HNF4α antibody (1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—For the yeast two-hybrid system, LexA and B42 fusion plasmids for nuclear receptors or co-activators were co-transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 strain containing the LacZ reporter plasmid (p80p-lac Z) under the control of the LexA binding site. β-Galactosidase activity expressed on the plates was assayed as described previously (23Song K.H. Park Y.Y. Park K.C. Hong C.Y. Park J.H. Shong M. Lee K. Choi H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1929-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For assay of thyroid hormone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, retinoid X receptor, and retinoic acid receptor, 100 μl of 1 μm stock solution of the appropriate ligands (T3, dexamethasone, all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoid) was added before plating to test the effect of ligand activation on interaction. Assays were repeated at least three times. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—For luciferase reporter assay, HepG2 cells were plated in 24-well plates 24 h before transfection with reporter or expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total DNA used in each transfection was adjusted by adding the appropriate amount of pcDNA3 vector. Luciferase activities are expressed as relative luciferase unit/β-galactosidase activity as described previously (23Song K.H. Park Y.Y. Park K.C. Hong C.Y. Park J.H. Shong M. Lee K. Choi H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1929-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Experiments—The SMART pool siRNAs for human Prox1 were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, Co) and transfected into HepG2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were extracted and analyzed. The SMART pool is a mixture of four sequences located at different regions of mRNA. Two of them were tested to be effective in knockdown Prox1 in HepG2 cells. The siRNA sequences are: siRNA#1, nucleotides 1009–1027, GGGCCAAACTCCTTACAAC; siRNA#2 nucleotides 2096–2114, GCAAAGATGTTGATCCTTC. The control siRNA probe is a scrambled siRNA that was designed to have the same G-C content as the siRNA#2 but did not display sequence identity with Prox1: GATCGTGTGTAGTTCATAACC. RNA Isolation and Real Time Quantitative PCR—HepG2 cells was transfected with synthesized siRNA of human Prox1 and total RNA was isolated using Tri-reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reverse-transcription and real time quantitative PCR were performed to detect Prox1, CYP7A1, PEPCK, HNF4α, and cyclophilin B mRNAs as described previously (13Song K.H. Chiang J.Y. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed using a ChIP Assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HepG2 were transfected with pcDNA3 empty vector or Flag-Prox1, and chromatin was cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde and sonicated as reported previously (24Li T. Chiang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G74-G84Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cell lysate solution (5%) in ChIP dilution buffer was kept aside as “input.” Ten μg of HNF4α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was added to precipitate DNA-protein complexes, and non-immune IgG was used as a control. A 391-bp DNA fragment (–432 to –41) containing the BARE-I and BARE-II of the CYP7A1 promoter was PCR-amplified for 30 cycles using 5 μl of the DNA as template and analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. PCR primers for amplification were as follows: 5′-ATCACCGTCTCTCTGGCAAAGCAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCATTAACTTGAGCTTGGTTGACAAAG-3′. Bile Acid Analysis—The siRNA for human Prox1 and control siRNA were transfected into HepG2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed and then incubated with serum-free medium for a period of time from 3 to 24 h. The medium was collected at indicated time points and frozen at –80 °C for later analysis of bile acids. At the end of the incubation, the cells were harvested and stored at –80 °C until use. A Sep-Pak C18 reversed phase cartridge (Waters Associates, Inc., Milford, MA) was used for bile acid extraction from media as described previously (25Feldmann D. Fenech C. Cuer J.F. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Total bile acid concentration was analyzed by enzymatic 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase method using total bile acid assay kit (Bio-quant Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Prox1 Interacts with HNF4α in Vivo and in Vitro—The nuclear receptors that have been identified to interact with Prox1 all belong to the NR5A subfamily (14Steffensen K.R. Holter E. Bavner A.

To identify other potential interaction partners of Prox1, we performed yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assays using LexA and B42 constructs available in our laboratory. Table 1 shows that Prox1 interacted with HNF4α. This interaction is stronger than Prox1 interaction with steroidogenic factor 1. On the other hand, Prox1 did not interact with thyroid hormone receptor α, thyroid hormone receptor β, retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, SHP, dosage-sensitive sex reversal, AHC critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX-1), and Nur77 regardless of the presence or absence of their respective ligands (Table 1). Transcriptional repressors N-CoR and SMRT did not interact with Prox1. These results showed that Prox1 interacts with HNF4α and NR5A family nuclear receptors.TABLE 1Interaction of Prox1 with nuclear receptors in yeast two-hybrid interaction assayLEXAB42Interaction---Prox1---Prox1-Thyroid hormone receptor αProx1-Thyroid hormone receptor βProx1-Glucocorticoid receptorProx1-Retinoic acid receptor αProx1-Retinoid X receptor αProx1-SHPProx1-DAX-1Prox1-N-CORProx1-SMRTProx1-Prox1NUR77-Prox1SF-1+++Prox1HNF4α++++SHPHNF4α+++ Open table in a new tab To further confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay, we performed in vitro GST pull-down assays to study Prox1 and HNF4α interaction. Consistent with yeast two-hybrid assay results, GST-Prox1 interacted with HNF4α but not retinoid X receptor and retinoic acid receptor (Fig. 1A). The physical interaction between GST-Prox1 and 35S-labeled FTF was used as a positive control (Fig. 1A). To further verify the interaction between Prox1 and HNF4α, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using human primary hepatocyte extracts. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HNF4α antibody. The immunoprecipitated complexes were then analyzed on an immunoblot with anti-Prox1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, the anti-Prox1 antibody detected Prox1 in the immunoprecipitates, whereas non-immune IgG did not. These results indicated that Prox1 interacted with HNF4α in primary human hepatocytes, consistent with the results from yeast two-hybrid assay and GST pull-down assay. Mapping of the Interaction Regions of Prox1 and HNF4α—Co-regulators have conserved LXXLL motifs that are known to interact with the ligand binding domain (LBD) of nuclear receptors. Prox1 has two LXXLL motifs located in the N terminus and another motif located in the C terminus region. It has been reported that the N-terminal nuclear receptor box 1 (NR1, LRKLL) is critical for interaction with FTF/LRH-1, whereas NR2 (ISQLL) and NR3 are not essential for interaction (14Steffensen K.R.

The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that the full-length and N-terminal amino acid residues from 1 to 312 (Prox1-NT-WT) interacted with HNF4α (Fig. 2A). However, the C-terminal homeo and prospero domains (Prox1-Homeo) did not interact with HNF4α. When the LRKLL sequence (NR1) was mutated to ARKAL (Prox-NT-MT), this mutant did not interact with HNF4α. These results demonstrated that the N-terminal region of Prox1 interacted with HNF4α and the LRKLL motif is critical for Prox1 to interact with HNF4α. We then investigated which region of HNF4α was required for interaction with Prox1. A series of deletion constructs of HNF4α were used to map the HNF4α interaction domain in yeast-two hybrid assay. Fig. 2B shows that the full-length HNF4α (HNF4α-full) and LBD, which contains activation function 2 (AF2) domain (HNF4α-LBD), interacted with Prox1. However, the N-terminal DBD region and a construct without AF2 (HNF4α-ΔAF2) did not interact with Prox1. These results indicate that HNF4α interacts with Prox1 through the AF2 domain of HNF4α. Prox1 Is Expressed in Human Hepatocytes—Although it has been reported that Prox1 is highly expressed in liver and pancreas (14Steffensen K.R. Holter E. Bavner A. Nilsson M. Pelto-Huikko M. Tomarev S. Treuter E. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the expression of Prox1 in human hepatocytes has not been reported before. Using real time quantitative PCR, we were able to detect the mRNA expressions of CYP7A1, Prox1, PGC-1α, and several nuclear receptors that are known to regulate CYP7A1 in five donor human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. Table 2 shows Ct, the threshold cycle number, for each mRNA transcripts assayed in these hepatocytes. The mRNA expression levels were normalized to internal reference gene UBC and the ΔCt values and S.D. are shown in the Table 2. The expression patterns of these mRNA transcripts are similar in five donor hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. The Ct and ΔCt values of CYP7A1 and PGC-1α are high, reflecting low levels of mRNA expression. Those values for Prox1, HNF4α, and SHP are low, indicating a relatively abundant expression of these three mRNA transcripts.TABLE 2Quantitative real time PCR analysis of mRNA expression levels of CYP7A1, nuclear receptors, and co-regulators in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cellsHH1201HH1205HH1209HH1247HH1248HepG2UBCCt ± S.D.Ct20.6 ± 0.319.8 ± 0.319.9 ± 0.0522.7 ± 0.0321.6 ± 0.0820.9 ± 0.07CYP7A1Ct ± S.D.Ct30.4 ± 0.0925.0 ± 0.1929.2 ± 0.0535.9 ± 0.4935.5 ± 0.3131.2 ± 0.03ΔCt ± S.D.ΔCt9.7 ± 0.314.9 ± 0.369.3 ± 0.0713.1 ± 0.4913.4 ± 0.3210.2 ± 0.076PGC-1αCt ± S.D.Ct27.7 ± 0.0924.4 ± 0.0127.4 ± 0.0228.2 ± 0.0228.3 ± 0.0327.8 ± 0.09ΔCt ± S.D.ΔCt7.0 ± 0.314.3 ± 0.37.5 ± 0.055.5 ± 0.046.7 ± 0.096.8 ± 0.11FXRCt ± S.D.Ct26.1 ± 0.422.8 ± 0.423.3 ± 0.0726.1 ± 0.0524.8 ± 0.0427.8 ± 0.3ΔCt ± S.D.ΔCt5.5 ± 0.52.7 ± 0.53.4 ± 0.073.4 ± 0.063.2 ± 0.096.7 ± 0.3FTFCt ± S.D.Ct24.4 ± 0.0324.2 ± 0.524.2 ± 0.0327.2 ± 0.0306.3 ± 0.0825.8 ± 0.08ΔCt ± S.D.ΔCt3.7 ± 0.34.1 ± 0.584.3 ± 0.064.5 ± 0.044.7 ± 0.114.9 ± 0.11Prox1Ct ± S.D.Ct24.8 ± 0.2323.9 ± 0.224.2 ± 0.0826.1 ± 0.0825.3 ± 0.0824.1 ± 0.03ΔCt ± S.D.ΔCt4.2 ± 0.383.8 ± 0.364.3 ± 0.093.4 ± 0.093.7 ± 0.113.1 ± 0.08HNF4αCt ± S.D.Ct24.6 ± 0.0121.4 ± 0.0821.9 ± 0.0125.2 ± 0.0223.4 ± 0.0423.8 ± 0.05ΔCt ± S.D.ΔCt3.9 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.312.0 ± 0.052.5 ± 0.041.8 ± 0.092.8 ± 0.08SHPCt ± S.D.Ct24.4 ± 0.0321.7 ± 0.423.4 ± 0.125.7 ± 0.0723.9 ± 0.1421.8 ± 0.07ΔCt ± S.D.ΔCt3.7 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.53.5 ± 0.113.0 ± 0.082.3 ± 0.160.9 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab Prox1 Is a Transcriptional Repressor of HNF4α—We then studied the transcriptional activity of Prox1 in reporter assays in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, ectopic expression of HNF4α increased a heterologous HNF4α-tk-luciferase reporter activity. Addition of Prox1 substantially repressed HNF4α transactivation activity in a dose-dependent manner. As a negative control, a reporter construct containing 3 copies of Nur77 response element (NurRE-Luc) was not affected by Prox1 (Fig. 3B). Because the N-terminal domain that contains an NR1 motif is important for Prox1 to interact with HNF4α, we performed transfection assays to test the effect of wild-type and mutant Prox1 constructs on HNF4α reporter activity. Fig. 3C shows that wild-type Prox1-Full and Prox1-NT-WT represses HNF4α-mediated transactivation but Prox-1-NT-MT failed to repress the activity suggesting that the N-terminal region of the LXXLL motif of Prox1 is involved in the interaction and repression of HNF4α transactivation activity. Prox1 Suppresses HNF4α Transactivation of the Human CYP7A1 Gene—Recent studies have provided substantial evidence that HNF4α is an important transcription factor that regulates liver-specific expression of CYP7A1 (4Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). HNF4α is the only nuclear receptor that activates the human CYP7A1 gene in transfection assays in HepG2 cells (24Li T. Chiang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G74-G84Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Chen W. Owsley E. Yang Y. Stroup D. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1402-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus investigated the effect of Prox1 on CYP7A1 transcription. As shown in Fig. 4A, ectopically expressed HNF4α modestly induced CYP7A1 reporter activity in HepG2 cells. This may be because of inhibition of HNF4α transactivation of CYP7A1 activity by endogenous Prox1. Co-expression of increasing amounts of Prox1 expression vectors caused marked repression of human CYP7A1 promoter reporter activity to a level below the basal activity. This suggests that exogenous Prox1 could suppress CYP7A1 basal reporter activity induced by endogenous HNF4α. To further confirm the involvement of HNF4α in transactivation of CYP7A1 and its inhibition by Prox1, we studied the effect of Prox1 on a reporter with a mutation in the HNF4α binding site (mHNF4-hCYP7A1-Luc). This reporter has a basal activity that is ∼1,000-fold lower than the wild-type reporter. Prox1 only slightly inhibited the HNF4α site mutant reporter (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that Prox1 interacts with HNF4α and represses HNF4α-mediated human CYP7A1 gene expression. Prox1 Blocks HNF4α Recruitment of PG"

The constitutional t(11;22)(q23;q11), which is the only known recurrent non-Robertsonian translocation, represents a good model for studying translocations in humans. Here we demonstrate polymorphisms of the palindromic sequence at the t(11;22) breakpoint that affect the frequency of de novo translocations in sperm from normal males. A typical allele consists of a perfect palindrome, producing ~10-5 de novo t(11;22) translocations. Alleles with an asymmetric center do not form the t(11;22). Our data show the importance of genome sequence on chromosomal rearrangements, a class of human mutation that is thought to be random."

In the present work, we describe the effects of mDia1-FH2 on the conformation of actin filaments by using a temperature-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer method. Our results revealed that actin filaments were more flexible in the presence than in the absence of formin. The effect strongly depends on the mDia1-FH2 concentration in a way that indicates that more than one mechanism is responsible for the formin effect. In accordance with the more flexible filament structure, the thermal stability of actin decreased and the rate of phosphate dissociation from actin filaments increased in the presence of formin. The interpretation of the results supports a model in which formin binding to barbed ends makes filaments more flexible through long range allosteric interactions, whereas binding of formin to the sides of the filaments stabilizes the protomer-protomer interactions. These results suggest that formins can regulate the conformation of actin filaments and may thus also modulate the affinity of actin-binding proteins to filaments nucleated/capped by formins.

Weyand M. Lammers M. Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2005; 435: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have been determined so far. Despite the numerous studies characterizing the effect of formin fragments on the polymerization properties of actin, very little is known about the effect of formins on the conformation of actin. One of the few related observations was that the affinity of CapG protein for actin filaments decreased by a factor of ∼100 in the presence of mDia1-FH2 fragments (26Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and the weaker affinity was not due to the direct competition of the two proteins. This observation indicates that mDia1-FH2 (and also the FH1-FH2 fragment) may induce conformational changes at the barbed end of actin filaments. Supporting the existence of the formin effect on actin, the recently solved structure of the complex of Bni1p-FH2 and actin showed that a special conformational strain was generated when formin bound to the actin structure mimicking the barbed end (29Otomo T. Tomchick D.R. Otomo C. Panchal S.C. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In this work, we studied the effects of mDia1-FH2 fragments on the conformational properties of actin filaments by using temperature-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. The results revealed that mDia1-FH2 fragments increased the flexibility of actin filaments. The magnitude of the effect of formin depended on the formin:actin concentration ratio. The characteristics of the formin concentration dependence indicated that more than one mechanism was involved in the formin effects. The results were interpreted assuming that formin binding to the barbed end made the actin filaments more flexible. This formin effect propagated through allosteric interaction to actin protomers far from the barbed end. At greater formin concentrations, the binding of formin fragments to the sides of the actin filaments could stiffen the interaction between neighboring actin protomers along the filaments. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that actin filaments serve as information channels in vivo. The formin-induced conformational changes in actin filaments can play a role in modifying and regulating the affinity of various actin-binding proteins for actin. This possible new mechanism could operate in the case of other actin nucleating factors as well and may provide a novel mechanism to regulate the formation of cytoskeletal protein complexes. Protein Preparations and Modifications—A core formin mDia1-FH2 fragment (amino acids 826–1163) and a longer mDia1-FH2 fragment (amino acids 752–1163) involving the linker region between the FH1 and FH2 domains was prepared as described in Ref. 25Shimada A.

The former is a monomeric protein (25Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol.

After the preparation, the formin fragments were kept in –80 °C in storing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol). Mouse cofilin-1 was purified as described in Ref. 31Vartiainen M.K. Mustonen T. Mattila P.K. Ojala P.J. Thesleff I. Partanen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar. Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared as described previously (32Feuer G. Molnár F. Pettkó E. Straub F.B. Hung. Acta Physiol. 1948; 1: 150-163PubMed Google Scholar, 33Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in this work were obtained using five independent formin and more than 10 independent actin preparations. Further purification of actin by a Sephacryl 300 column did not affect the results of our experiments (data not shown). The concentrations of actin and formin are given as monomer concentrations throughout the study. The concentration of actin was determined by using the extinction coefficient of 0.63 mg–1 ml cm–1 at 290 nm (34Houk T.W. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The mDia1-FH2monomer and mDia1-FH2dimer concentrations were determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm in 6 m GuHCl using the extinction coefficients of 7,680 m–1 cm–1 and 20,580 m–1 cm–1, which were estimated with ProtParam from the sequences (ExPASy Proteomics tools). Actin was labeled with pyrene (35Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), IAEDANS, or IAF (36Miki M. dos Remedios C.G. Barden J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Hild G. Nyitrai M. Somogyi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) on the Cys374 according to standard procedures. The concentrations of the probes were determined using the absorption coefficients of 22,000 m–1cm–1 at 344 nm for pyrene, 6,100 m–1 cm–1 at 336 nm for IAEDANS, and 60,000 m–1 cm–1 at 495 nm for IAF. The labeling ratio, i.e. the molar ratio of the bound probe to the actin concentration, was 0.9–1.0 for pyrene, 0.8–0.9 for IAEDANS, and 0.6–0.7 for IAF. Fluorescence Experiments—Monomeric calcium-actin was in 4 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 after preparation. The bound calcium was replaced with magnesium by adding 200 μm EGTA and 50 μm MgCl2 and incubating the samples for 5–10 min. The magnesium-actin was polymerized with 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm KCl in either the presence or the absence of formin fragments. The actin concentration was 5 μm unless stated otherwise. IAEDANS served as donor and IAF served as acceptor in the FRET experiments. Actin monomers separately labeled with either donor or acceptor were mixed in a 1:9 = donor-labeled:acceptor-labeled actin ratio. For FRET, reference samples were also prepared with 10% donor-labeled and 90% unlabeled actin. Then MgCl2 and KCl were added to the monomer actin to initiate polymerization, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C before the fluorescence experiments. The volume of the storing buffer, regardless of whether it was added with or without formin, was kept constant (5%) in the samples. To determine the efficiency (E) of the FRET, the fluorescence emission of the donor was measured in the absence (FD) and presence (FDA) of acceptor, and the following equation was applied. E=1-FDA/FD(Eq. 1) Fluorescence experiments were carried out with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer. To determine FD and FDA, the spectra of the samples were recorded using the excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The measured intensities were corrected for the inner filter effect using the absorption spectra of the samples (38Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 44Google Scholar), and the integrated intensities of the emission spectra between 440 and 460 nm in the absence and presence of acceptor were used as FD and FDA, respectively. To obtain information regarding the dynamic and conformational properties of actin filaments, the value of E was determined at different temperatures between 6 and 30 °C, and a special FRET parameter, the normalized FRET efficiency (f ′), was calculated using f'=E/FDA(Eq. 2) The temperature dependence of the f ′ is informative regarding the flexibility of the investigated protein (39Somogyi B. Matkó J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Somogyi B. Lakos Z. Szarka A. Nyitrai M. J. Photochem. Photobiol.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) on actin filaments. For the interpretation of the FRET results, the temperature dependence of the relative f ′, defined as the value of f ′ at the given temperature divided by the value at the lowest temperature (6 °C), is presented in this work. The intensity of actin-bound pyrene increases by a factor of ∼25 upon polymerization (44Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Pyrene actin was used here to monitor the time dependence of the formation of actin filaments. In these experiments, 5% of the actin was labeled with pyrene. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 365 and 407 nm, respectively, whereas the optical slits were set to 5 nm in both the excitation and the emission paths. The elongation rate was obtained from the slopes of the pyrene intensity versus time curves at 50% completion of the polymerization. When actin (5% pyrene-labeled) was polymerized overnight at different concentrations, the actin concentration dependence of the pyrene intensity was used to determine the critical concentration of actin filament assembly. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—The thermal denaturation of actin filaments was monitored between 0 and 100 °C with a SET-ARAM Micro DSC-II calorimeter. The heating rate was 0.3 K/min, and the actin concentration was 60 μm. The experiments were carried out in the absence or presence of 3 μm mDia1-FH2dimer. Calorimetric enthalpy change (ΔH) of the endothermic transitions was calculated from the area under the heat absorption curve. Transition entropy change (ΔS) was calculated for the peak transition temperature (Tm) from the following equation. ΔS=ΔH/Tm(Eq. 3) The Gibbs free enthalpy change was calculated for 22 °C from the following equation. ΔG=ΔH-TΔS(Eq. 4) Determination of the Phosphate Release Rate—The rate of dissociation of phosphate from actin filaments was measured based on the method originally described by Webb (45Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes). In the presence of Pi, the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside is converted enzymatically by purine nucleoside phosphorylase to ribose 1-phosphate and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl-purine. The enzymatic conversion of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside was followed by measuring the absorption at 360 nm. The experimental strategy was similar to that applied earlier by Carlier (46Carlier M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). First the bound calcium was replaced by magnesium in actin monomers, and then the actin at 100 μm was polymerized by the addition of 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm KCl in the absence or presence of formin. The polymerization was carried out for 2 min in the absence and for 1 min in the presence of formin. Then actin was added to the reaction buffer to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the absorbance at 360 nm was monitored. The reaction medium contained the standard buffer from the manufacturer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium azide) supplemented with 10 mm KCl. Co-sedimentation Assays—To characterize the binding of formin to actin filaments, actin (5 μm; 200 μl) was polymerized overnight at 4 °C as in the FRET assays in the absence or presence of various mDia1-FH2dimer concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 μm. The samples were then centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C with a Beckman Optima MAX benchtop ultracentrifuge and a TLA-100 rotor. The supernatants were separated from the pellets, and the pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer. All supernatants and pellets were applied to a 12% SDS gel, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The actin band intensities were determined with a Syngene bio-imaging system. The affinity (K) of formin to the sides of actin filaments was estimated by analyzing the [bound formin] versus [total formin] plots using the following equation (47Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). [A]0D2-([A]0+[D]0+K)D+[D]0=0(Eq. 5) where [D]0 and [A]0 are the total formin and actin concentrations, respectively, and D is the fraction of bound formin. The fraction of bound formin was calculated as the ratio of the intensity of formin bands to that of the actin bands in the pellets. When the effect of formin on the interaction of actin filaments with cofilin was tested, preformed actin filaments (5 μm) polymerized either in the absence or in the presence of 0.5 μm mDia1-FH2dimer were incubated overnight at 4 °C with various concentrations of cofilin ranging from 0 to 5 μm. The samples were centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C, and the supernatants were applied to 12% SDS gels to quantify the concentration of the depolymerized actin. The actin band intensities were determined using a Syngene bio-imaging system. The actin concentrations in the supernatants were determined as Cactinsn=[Bsn/(Bsn+Bpel)]×Cactintotal(Eq. 6) where Bsn and Bpel are the actin band intensities in the supernatant and pellet, respectively, and cactintotal is the total actin concentration (5 μm). Our initial assays demonstrated that the fluorescence emission of IAEDANS-actin filaments (10% of the total 5 μm actin) decreased in the presence of acceptor due to the effect of FRET (Fig. 1A). In test experiments, the spectra were also recorded in the presence of 500 nm mDia1-FH2dimer (Fig. 1B). The results showed that the mechanism of FRET was effective to decrease the donor intensity in the presence of formin as well, which allowed the use of FRET method to examine the effects of formins on actin filaments. Temperature-dependent FRET Can Be Applied for Examining the Effects of Formins on Actin Filaments—A characteristic feature of formins is that they accelerate the polymerization of actin solutions in vitro by enhancing the rate of the formation of actin nuclei and by promoting barbed end assembly. By following the time kinetics of the pyrene signal, we observed that 64 nm mDia1-FH2dimer accelerated the actin polymerization ∼8-fold (Fig. 2A). Control experiments showed that mDia1-FH2dimer was effective in enhancing the polymerization rate at 6, 22, and 30 °C as well (Fig. 2A, inset), indicating that the interaction between the actin and formin was maintained between 6 and 30 °C. In some cases, fluorescent labeling of macromolecules can severely affect their behavior. We tested whether the formin enhanced the polymerization of donor- and acceptor-labeled actin samples. The fluorescence intensity of IAEDANS in the absence of the acceptor increased by ∼10% upon polymerization. The kinetics of the IAEDANS intensity change (Fig. 2B) showed that 64 nm mDia1-FH2dimer increased the polymerization rate by ∼8-fold, to an extent similar to that observed with pyrene actin. When the IAEDANS emission was recorded in the presence of acceptor, the intensity decreased upon polymerization due to the appearance of FRET (Fig. 2B). In this case, the kinetics observed in the absence of formin was ∼2-fold slower than that measured with pyrene actin, suggesting that the rate of association of acceptor-labeled actin monomers to the filaments was slower than that of the unlabeled ones. Formin (64 nm mDia1-FH2dimer) accelerated the polymerization of the double-labeled actin samples ∼10-fold, which is close to the value measured with pyrene actin (∼8-fold). These observations demonstrated that mDia1-FH2dimer retained its ability to accelerate the polymerization of actin after the actin was labeled with the fluorescent probes. Similar experiments at various formin concentrations (from 50 nm to 1.5 μm) corroborated this conclusion (data are not shown). In this study, we applied temperature-dependent fluorescence experiments. Under any conditions, a fraction of the actin population, characterized by the critical concentration, is in monomeric form. Actin in its monomeric form cannot contribute to the measured transfer efficiency, and the temperature-induced changes in the critical concentration could insert errors to the interpretation of the FRET data. It was therefore important to test whether the temperature change between 6 and 30 °C shifted the equilibrium between the monomeric and filamentous forms of actin. The critical concentration of actin was measured using the pyrene assay at 6, 22, and 30 °C (data are not shown). The critical concentration was 250–300 nm, in agreement with our previous observations (25Shimada A. Nyitrai M. Vetter I.R. Kuhlmann D. Bugyi B. Narumiya S. Geeves M.A. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and proved to be temperature-independent. The experiments were repeated in the presence of 250 nm mDia1-FH2dimer (Fig. 2C). Neither the formin nor the temperature changed the critical concentration for actin assembly. The formin independence of the critical concentration is in agreement with previous observations (4Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 26Romero S. Le Clainche C. Didry D. Egile C. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To test the effect of the applied donor and acceptor on the temperature dependence of the critical concentration, the FRET efficiency (E) was determined as a function of actin concentration. The method is based on the consideration that FRET cannot effectively occur between unpolymerized actin monomers, and thus the FRET efficiency can be used as the measure of actin filament concentration.

Over 20 microbial pathogens are known to use surface Sia decoration as a form of molecular mimicry that is often crucial to virulence (1Vimr E. Lichtensteiger C.

Heavily sialylated bacteria often cause sepsis and meningitis by exhibiting Sia-dependent serum resistance due to deactivation of the alternative complement pathway (2Marques M.B. Kasper D.L.

Antibodies elicited against sialylated bacterial glycolipids can also cross-react with host peripheral nerve axons, leading to the debilitating autoimmune disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome (8Hughes R.A.

In short, there are multiple Sia-dependent virulence mechanisms that enhance bacterial survival and/or result in host tissue injury.

Tomassini B. Ventura N. Condo I. Rippo M.R. Rufini A. Liberati L. Nachtigall C. Kniep B. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Despite the potential of Sia O-acetylation to affect pathologic processes, little is known of its role at the host-pathogen interface. Elucidation of the molecular genetic basis of this modification is critical for mechanistic understanding of Sia as a microbial virulence determinant. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in human newborn infants and is increasingly associated with invasive infections in adult patient populations (23Edwards M.S. Nizet V. Baker C.J. Remington J. Klein J. Baker C.J. Wilson C.B. Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn Infant. 6th Ed. Elsevier Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2006: 403-464Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The surface capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of all nine identified GBS serotypes invariably display a terminal α2-3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), the predominant Sia on the surface of human cells. Recently, we discovered that these Neu5Ac residues are modified with various levels of O-acetylation (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Due to the chemical lability of O-acetyl esters, nearly three decades of previously published investigations on the biochemistry of the GBS CPS addressed neither the presence of Sia O-acetylation nor its potential implications for pathogenesis and immunogenicity. We demonstrate the genetic basis for Sia O-acetylation in GBS, including a polymorphism associated with variation in O-acetylation levels among clinical GBS strains. We show that the GBS Sia O-acetyltransferase, NeuD, is itself required for CPS sialylation, a role that can be separated from its O-acetyltransferase activity. A bioinformatic approach further revealed that neuD homologs are present within many bacterial Sia biosynthetic gene clusters. Strains and Culture Conditions, DNA Isolation, and PCR—Wild-type (WT) serotype III GBS strain COH1 was the background for all isogenic modifications. GBS were propagated on Todd-Hewitt agar plates or liquid broth at 37 °C without shaking unless specified, with 10 μg/ml erythromycin or 2 μg/ml chloramphenicol selection when indicated. Escherichia coli K1 strain ATCC 23511 was propagated in Luria broth (or agar) at 37 °C. Allelic Replacement Mutagenesis—Precise in-frame allelic replacement of the GBS neuD gene with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene was performed as described previously for allelic replacement of the GBS iagA gene (24Doran K.S. Engelson E.J. Khosravi A. Maisey H.C. Fedtke I. Equils O. Michelsen K.S. Arditi M. Peschel A. Nizet V. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2499-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The primers used to amplify neuD upstream and downstream flanking sequences were: NeuDF 5′-gctacatggagaaagtgtag-3′ + NeuDIOF 5′-cattttagattattctcctttaaatca-3′, and NeuDR 5′-caatgtcgtaaacagaccag-3′ + NeuDIOR 5′-taaaggatatgttatgaagccaatttg-3′, respectively. The temperature-sensitive targeting plasmid pNeuD-KO derived by this technique was used to transform WT COH1. Differential temperature and antibiotic selection (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) facilitated precise allelic replacement of neuD with cat to yield mutant COH1ΔNeuD, as confirmed by direct sequence analysis of chromosomal DNA. Slight modifications of the same protocol were used to generate a derivative of COH1 containing a single base pair mutation in neuD changing residue 88 of the encoded protein from phenylalanine to cysteine (F88C). The targeting vector was generated from a NeuDF + NeuDR PCR amplicon of type II GBS strain DK23 bearing the identified neuD polymorphism. This vector was used to transform COH1ΔNeuD with temperature shifts and differential antibiotic selection identifying a chloramphenicol-sensitive mutant in which cat was precisely replaced with the DK23 neuD gene. The resulting mutant (COH1-NeuDF88C) was confirmed by direct sequence analysis to be identical to WT COH1 except bearing the DK23 version of neuD. Complementation Studies—WT GBS COH1 neuD was subcloned from the pCR2.1 vector above into streptococcal expression vector pDCerm (25Jeng A. Sakota V. Li Z. Datta V. Beall B. Nizet V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), yielding pGBS-NeuD. E. coli K1 strain ATCC23511 neuD was amplified using primers 5′-cgtctagacgatgagtaaaaagttaataatatttggtgcggg-3′ and 5′-cgggatcccgttcattccccctaattaatcttgttgg-3′ based on published sequence (26Annunziato P.W. Wright L.F. Vann W.F. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 312-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into pDCerm to produce pEcK1-NeuD. Sequencing of neuD from strain ATCC23511 revealed 99.5% identity with the published neuD sequence of E. coli K1 RS218 (NCBI accession number AAC43301), differing only at residue 164, where cysteine replaces valine. Each NeuD expression construct was used to transform electrocompetent COH1ΔNeuD, and the resulting erythromycin-resistant transformants were analyzed by 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene derivatization and HPLC as below. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of NeuD lysine 123 to alanine in pGBS-NeuD plasmid was accomplished by QuikChange (Stratagene) using the PAGE-purified primer 5′-ggggcttttataggttctaaagtggcgctgtttgataacaacg-3′ and its reverse complement followed by DpnI digestion to remove residual template. DNA isolated by ethanol precipitation was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli MC1061, and plasmid pGBS-NeuD-K123A was confirmed by sequencing to harbor only the single residue change in the neuD coding region. Release, 1,2-Diamino-4,5-methylene Dioxybenzene Derivatization, and HPLC Analysis and Quantitation of Sialic Acids—Sias were released from phosphate-buffered saline-washed GBS using 2 n acetic acid for 3 h at 80°C (27Varki A. Diaz S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Acid release is known to induce some migration of O-acetyl esters from the 7-9-carbon positions (27Varki A. Diaz S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); this behavior has also been documented for GBS (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Sias released from GBS were fluorescently labeled with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene and resolved by reverse phase HPLC as described (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Peaks were assigned based on retention times of standard sialic acids, as well as NaOH lability of O-acetyl esters (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Homology Modeling—Homology modeling of NeuD was based on the Protein Data Bank coordinates (1KRR) of the E. coli galactoside acetyltransferase (GAT) in complex with acetyl-coenzyme A. Modeling was accomplished using the program Modeler 7v7 (Andrej Sali) and an alignment of the two sequences produced by clustalX. The root mean square difference between GAT coordinates and the modeled NeuD structure was determined using the Unix-based program O using residues 83-99 and 105-144 of GAT and residues 91-107 and 111-160 of NeuD. Energy parameters as determined by Modeler were acceptable with no error messages during execution of the script. PROCHECK was used to generate Ramachandran plots of both the experimentally determined (GAT) and the modeled (NeuD) coordinates, each showing two residues near the C terminus in disallowed regions of the plot. Reconstruction of the modeled NeuD trimer complete with the coordinates of acetyl-coenzyme A from 1KRR was performed using the program O. Bioinformatic Approach for Locating neuD Homologs in Sia Biosynthetic Clusters—We compiled lists of organisms that encode homologs of each of the GBS gene products (NeuA-D) with characterized roles in Sia biosynthesis. BLAST searches on the public domain NCBI data base were performed using sequences of the four GBS genes. Alternatively, the “Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins,” or the COG system (28Tatusov R.L. Fedorova N.D. Jackson J.D. Jacobs A.R. Kiryutin B. Koonin E.V. Krylov D.M. Mazumder R. Mekhedov S.L. Nikolskaya A.N. Rao B.S. Smirnov S. Sverdlov A.V. Vasudevan S. Wolf Y.I. Yin J.J. Natale D.A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (3444) Google Scholar), available through The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) microbial genome data base, was used to generate lists of organisms with NeuA-D homologs. The four lists were compared and compiled manually to determine which organisms contained all four biosynthetic genes. Although there are a few cases in which the UDP-GlcNAc epimerase (NeuC) is encoded separately, we only included organisms that had a clearly defined clustering of Sia biosynthetic genes (see accession numbers). Note that the term “Sia biosynthetic clusters” is used to describe gene arrangements and their homologies, without necessarily implying the production of Sias. Phylogenetic Analysis of Bacterial Hexapeptide Repeat Family O-Acetyltransferases—ClustalX was used to produce a multiple alignment comparing NeuD amino acid sequences with Sia O-acetyltransferases (NeuO and OatWY) from E. coli (AAX11174) and Neisseria meningitidis (CAC38867), serine acetyltransferases from E. coli (NP_312512) and Zea mays (corn; AAN76864), and E. coli GAT (NP414876) and MAT (maltose O-acetyltransferase, P77791). A Nexus file format of the multiple alignment was used in PAUP 4.0b10 to create an unrooted parsimony tree using the “heuristic search” command with default settings. NeuD Is Involved in Sia Biosynthesis—We previously speculated that the GBS neuD gene may encode a Sia O-acetyltransferase (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based on its physical location (clustered with other GBS Sia biosynthesis genes) and its homology to hexapeptide repeat acetyltransferases of the CysE/LacA/LpxA/NodL family. Non-polar allelic replacement mutagenesis of neuD in WT GBS COH1 resulted in severe attenuation of overall Sia biosynthesis and O-acetylation (Fig. 1A). The COH1ΔNeuD mutant lost buoyancy and precipitated readily from static culture, consistent with the requirement of sialylation for maximal CPS expression in GBS (29Chaffin D.O. Mentele L.M. Rubens C.E. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4615-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both Sia biosynthesis and O-acetylation could be restored to the COH1ΔNeuD mutant by complementation in trans with pGBS-NeuD (Fig. 1A). Higher levels of O-acetylation upon overexpression of NeuD on the high copy number complementation vector likely reflect stoichiometric constraints for proper functions that are common among biosynthetic complexes. The simple mutagenesis and complementation analysis proved insufficient to define the hypothesized role of NeuD as an O-acetyltransferase. We thus undertook further studies to dissect the potential dual functions of NeuD in Sia biosynthesis and O-acetylation. NeuD Is the GBS Sia O-Acetyltransferase—A strategy of site-directed mutagenesis was employed to discriminate between hypothetical dual functions of NeuD in GBS Sia biosynthesis and Sia O-acetylation. Homology modeling of NeuD was used to predict a residue in the proposed GBS NeuD active site that would be specifically involved in O-acetyl transfer to Sia residues. The aim was to complement the asialo-COH1ΔNeuD mutant with a modified version of GBS neuD that could still perform the presumed Sia biosynthetic function but not the O-acetyltransferase function. The GBS NeuD model in Fig. 1B is based on the crystal structure of the E. coli GAT (Protein Data Bank number 1KRR). Overlay of these molecules reveals a striking similarity in three-dimensional structure, despite only 16% identity between their primary sequences. When compared with the 2.5 Å resolution structure of GAT (30Wang X.G. Olsen L.R. Roderick S.L. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 581-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the GBS NeuD model had a root mean square difference of 1.04 over 55 amino acids involved in the left-handed β-helix domain of this enzyme family. Examination of the GBS NeuD model predicted lysine residue 123 to be involved in the critical acetyl-coenzyme A binding function (Fig. 1B). GBS NeuD also contains a lysine residue at position 121 that may be involved in the acetylation reaction. We chose Lys-123 for mutagenesis because it aligns with His-115 of the E. coli galactoside acetyltransferase (Fig. 1C), which is predicted to abstract a proton from the acceptor hydroxyl group, allowing attack of the resulting carbonyl by acetyl CoA (31Lewendon A. Ellis J. Shaw W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26326-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change NeuD lysine 123 to alanine. The resulting plasmid (pGBS-NeuD-K123A) was introduced by electroporation into GBS mutant COH1ΔNeuD. As predicted, the NeuD-K123A plasmid restored Sia biosynthesis to the ΔNeuD mutant. In contrast, O-acetylation of Neu5Ac was barely detectable (Fig. 1D), indicating that NeuD is indeed the GBS Sia O-acetyltransferase and that Lys-123 is required for efficient acetyl transfer. These data suggest that despite their ancient relationship, GAT and NeuD likely share a similar mechanism of action. A neuD Polymorphism Associated with Varied O-Acetylation Levels among GBS Strains—During our initial discovery of Neu5Ac O-acetylation in GBS CPS, we noted that clinical isolates expressed either higher (40-55%) or lower (2-15%) levels of this Sia modification (17Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To probe the basis for this GBS strain variation in Sia O-acetylation, we sequenced the complete neuD gene from three strains belonging to each group (“high OAc” versus “low OAc”). We found that a single non-synonymous nucleotide change correlated with O-acetylation status, wherein high OAc strains (including COH1) had a thymine at position 264, and low OAc strains had a guanine at that position. This polymorphism leads to an amino acid coding change at position 88, with phenylalanine in high OAc strains and cysteine in low OAc strains (Fig. 2A). To ascertain whether a functional relationship existed between the identified nucleotide polymorphism and the observed levels of Sia O-acetylation, the neuD gene of low OAc serotype II strain DK23 was used to precisely replace the native neuD gene within the chromosome of high OAc WT strain COH1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting “knock-in” mutant COH1-NeuDF88C, differing from WT COH1 by just the single nucleotide polymorphism in neuD, was found to exhibit a low OAc phenotype (Fig. 2B). This result identifies the existence of at least one specific genetic polymorphism that contributes functionally to variation in total O-acetylation levels among GBS strains. E. coli K1 neuD Encodes an Active Sia O-Acetyltransferase—Homologs of the GBS Sia biosynthetic enzymes (NeuA, B, and C) can be identified in a number of other organisms including sialylated pathogens and their human hosts. Like GBS, E. coli K1 is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, expresses a surface CPS containing Neu5Ac, and further modifies this Sia by O-acetylation (10Orskov F. Orskov I. Sutton A. Schneerson R. Lin W. Egan W. Hoff G.E. Robbins J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 32Higa H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8872-8878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli K1 also has a homolog of the GBS neuD gene alongside the Sia biosynthetic cluster. Earlier studies demonstrated that disruption of the E. coli K1 neuD gene leads to total loss of Sia expression and that Sia expression could be restored to the resulting mutant by introduction of plasmids expressing either the E. coli K1 or the GBS versions of NeuD (33Daines D.A. Wright L.F. Chaffin D.O. Rubens C.E. Silver R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 281-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Discovery of the NeuO poly-Sia O-acetyltransferase (34Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), coupled with an experiment in which the complete E. coli K1 Sia gene cluster (including neuD) failed to confer CPS Sia O-acetylation to a non-K1 E. coli host (35Silver R.P. Finn C.W. Vann W.F. Aaronson W. Schneerson R. Kretschmer P.J. Garon C.F. Nature. 1981; 289: 696-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), led the investigators to a logical conclusion that a role for NeuD in Sia O-acetylation was unlikely for either GBS or E. coli K1 (34Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite these considerations, the current studies allowed us to conclude that NeuD is in fact the GBS Sia O-acetyltransferase. Thus, we next asked whether the homologous E. coli K1 NeuD also has demonstrable Sia O-acetyltransferase activity. Expression vector pNeuD-EcK1, containing the neuD gene of E. coli K1 strain ATCC23511, was introduced into the asialo-GBS mutant COH1ΔNeuD and was observed to restore both Sia biosynthesis and high levels of O-acetylation (Fig. 3). This result indicates that despite only 30% sequence identity between the GBS and E. coli K1 NeuD enzymes, they are both able to carry out Sia biosynthetic and O-acetyltransferase functions in GBS. NeuD Homologs Are Broadly Represented among Bacterial Species— Given the orthologous relationship between GBS and E. coli K1 neuD genes, we explored whether neuD is a common component of Sia biosynthetic clusters. Using a bioinformatic approach, we found neuD homologs that are physically associated with Sia biosynthetic gene clusters in the genomes of 18 bacterial species (Fig. 4, A and B), many of which have not to date been analyzed for Sia expression (Fig. 4B) Phylogenetic analysis indicates that NeuD homologs of sialylated pathogens (in Fig. 4A) have a common evolutionary lineage, distinct from chloramphenicol, maltose, galactoside, and serine acetyltransferases (Fig. 4C). The tree also shows that the Sia O-acetyltransferases from E. coli (NeuO) and N. meningitidis (OatWY), which likely both act on polysialic acid, evolved independently from the NeuD subfamily, appearing more closely related to maltose and galactoside acetyltransferases. A second predicted O-acetyltransferase of this family in the GBS genome (AAM99894) clusters phylogenetically with the maltose and galactoside acetyltransferases (Fig. 4C). Single crossover (Campbell-type) plasmid integrational disruption of this gene in WT GBS strain COH1 resulted in no change in overall sialylation or O-acetylation (data not shown), indicating that it is not involved in either of these processes. In the present work, we show that NeuD has dual roles in GBS sialylation and Sia O-acetylation that can be distinguished using site-directed mutagenesis. We identified Lys-123 as a critical residue for efficient acetyl transfer and demonstrate that a naturally occurring single residue polymorphism in the neuD coding region allows variation in the GBS O-acetylation phenotype. Complementation analysis shows that E. coli K1 neuD also encodes an active Sia O-acetyltransferase within the context of the GBS biosynthetic machinery. Indeed, neuD homologs are found within Sia biosynthetic gene clusters in at least 18 bacterial species, 12 of which are not currently known to synthesize Sias. On mammalian cells, Sia O-acetylation can affect apoptotic regulation (36Malisan F. Franchi L. Tomassini B. Ventura N. Condo I. Rippo M.R. Rufini A. Liberati L. Nachtigall C. Kniep B. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), susceptibility to alternative complement, tissue tropism, and binding to leukocyte-expressed Sia-binding proteins (22Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki N.M. Powell L. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31526-31532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Due to past issues of chemical lability and genetic intractability, understanding the role(s) of bacterial Sia O-acetylation has been very difficult. These studies offer a specific approach to experimentally assess the importance of this modification in bacterial pathogenesis. Pathogenic strains of E. coli and C. jejuni that cause bloody diarrhea in humans often express Neu5Ac as part of their lipo-oligosaccharides (15Gamian A. Romanowska E. Ulrich J. Defaye J. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 236: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Moran A.P. Rietschel E.T. Kosunen T.U. Zahringer U. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 618-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the E. coli O104 antigen is known to be O-acetylated (15Gamian A. Romanowska E. Ulrich J. Defaye J. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 236: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), this modification has not been reported for E. coli O145 or lipo-oligosaccharides of any Campylobacter species. O-acetylation of lipo-oligosaccharide Sia is especially relevant because mimicry of host gangliosides is felt to be a pivotal factor in the autoimmune damage to motor axons that characterizes Campylobacter-associated Guillain-Barré syndrome (8Hughes R.A. Cornblath D.R. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1653-1666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Serum antibodies recognizing O-acetyl forms of gangliosides GD1b, GD3, or GT3 have been identified in subsets of patients with this nervous system disorder (38Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kon K. Chiba A. Waki H. Ando S. Kanazawa I. J. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 66: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 39Koga M. Yuki N. Ariga T. Hirata K. J. Neurol. Sci. 1999; 164: 50-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We identify NeuD homologs in the Sia biosynthetic clusters of C. jejuni, E. coli O104, and E. coli O145 (Fig. 4). Some bacterial agents of pneumonia synthesize nine-carbon acidic sugars that are structurally similar to Neu5Ac using homologous biosynthetic pathways (40Luneberg E. Zetzmann N. Alber D. Knirel Y.A. Kooistra O. Zahringer U. Frosch M. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These sugars, known as legionaminic acids (Leg) and pseudaminic acids (Pse) (Fig. 4A), have been called “Sia-like” molecules (41Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) and are found in over a dozen bacterial species including L. pneumophila, P. aeruginosa, and pathogenic Vibrio spp (42Knirel Y.A. Shashkov A.S. Tsvetkov Y.E. Jansson P.E. Zahringer U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2003; 58: 371-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis has shown that Leg and Pse molecules on the surfaces of L. pneumophila, P. aeruginosa, and C. jejuni are modified by O-acetylation (12Knirel Y.A. Vinogradov E.V. Shashkov A.S. Dmitriev B.A. Kochetkov N.K. Stanislavsky E.S. Mashilova G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Thibault P. Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Brisson J.R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34862-34870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 16Knirel Y.A. Rietschel E.T. Marre R. Zahringer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We now show that like the Neu5Ac biosynthetic clusters, both Leg and Pse biosynthetic clusters also include a neuD homolog (Fig. 4A), further supporting the evolutionary relationship between these biosynthetic pathways and their inclusion in the larger category of Sias. The presence of NeuD in Leg and Pse biosynthetic clusters predicts a genetic basis for O-acetylation of these related sugars. Unlike the poly-Sia O-acetyltransferases of E. coli K1 and N. meningitidis, we could not reliably align the legionaminic acid O-acetyltransferase of L. pneumophila to analyze its relationship with other enzymes in this family. Initial studies of a L. pneumophila Lag-1 mutant strongly suggested its role as a Leg O-acetyltransferase (43Zou C.H. Knirel Y.A. Helbig J.H. Zahringer U. Mintz C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4137-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was later recognized, however, that L. pneumophila often expresses Lag-1-independent O-acetylation of Leg residues in the LPS core region (44Kooistra O. Luneberg E. Lindner B. Knirel Y.A. Frosch M. Zahringer U. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7630-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the L. pneumophila neuD homolog represents a candidate gene for the remaining O-acetylation in the lag-1 mutant. It is theoretically possible that, like L. pneumophila, E. coli K1 strains express NeuO-independent O-acetylation of Sia moieties that are not accessible to specific polyclonal antisera used for O-acetyl analysis. Alternatively, NeuD may only be functional as an O-acetyltransferase in E. coli strains that produce sialylated lipo-oligosaccharide antigens (O104 and O145). If the latter were the case, K1 neuD would be conserved in this biosynthetic gene cluster solely for its role in sialylation. Further studies are needed to determine the actual roles of neuD homologs in these bacteria. Of the 18 bacterial species we identified using our bioinformatic approach, 12 are not currently known to express Sias (Fig. 4B). Among these are the human pathogens Vibrio vulnificans, causing wound infections and septicemia (45Strom M.S. Paranjpye R.N. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), Chromobacterium violaceum, an agent of serious invasive disease in pediatric age groups (46Chattopadhyay A. Kumar V. Bhat N. Rao P. J. Pediatr. Surg. 2002; 37: 108-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and Leptospira interrogans, a leading zoonotic pathogen producing systemic illnesses manifest by hepatic and renal dysfunction (47Bharti A.R. Nally J.E. Ricaldi J.N. Matthias M.A. Diaz M.M. Lovett M.A. Levett P.N. Gilman R.H. Willig M.R. Gotuzzo E. Vinetz J.M. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2003; 3: 757-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). For investigators working with each of these species, our identification of Sia gene clusters containing neuD may stimulate a search for the presence of Sias with O-acetyl modifications that likely play a role in environmental niche ecology and/or interactions with mammalian hosts. Although we have not precisely defined the duality of the role of NeuD in bacterial Sia biosynthesis, others have presented evidence that the E. coli K1 NeuD protein interacts with NeuB, the sialic acid synthetase (48Daines D.A. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5267-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with previous speculation that NeuD may play a structural role in stabilization of a Sia biosynthetic complex of enzymes (48Daines D.A. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5267-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), distinct from its O-acetyltransferase activity. Further investigations of the genetic basis and functional role of O-acetylation in Legionella, Pseudomonas, Campylobacter, Leptospira, Vibrio, etc. may require a similar approach to the present one, involving site-directed active site mutagenesis to discriminate between these dual biosynthetic roles. Some pathogens including N. meningitidis may have lost the requirement for NeuD in Sia biosynthesis since a corresponding gene is not easily discernable near the Sia biosynthetic cluster. Notably, unlike the other components of the Sia biosynthesis pathway (NeuA-C), which share homology between humans and bacteria (Fig. 4B), there are no mammalian homologs of any hexapeptide repeat acetyltransferase, including NeuD. Thus, NeuD may represent a unique bacterial target for rational drug design aimed at eliminating surface expression of sialic acid, a virulence phenotype of several human pathogens.

https://openalex.org/W2020940277,"Prolyl-4-hydroxylase α(I) (P4Hα(I)) is the rate-limiting subunit for P4H enzyme activity, which is essential for procollagen hydroxylation and secretion. In the current study, we have characterized the human P4Hα(I) promoter for transcription factors and DNA elements regulating P4Hα(I) expression. Using a progressive deletion cloning approach, we have constructed pGL3-P4Hα(I) recombinant plasmids. We have identified a positive regulatory region at the positions of bp –184 to –97 responsible for ∼80% of the P4Hα(I) promoter efficiency. Three E-boxes were located within this region, and the E-box at position bp –135 explains most of the regulatory capacity. Upstream stimulatory factors (USF1/USF2) were shown to bind on the E-box using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Suppression of USF1 and/or USF2 using specific short interference RNA resulted in a significant reduction in P4Hα(I) promoter activity, and overexpressed USF1 or USF2 increased P4Hα(I) promoter activity significantly. Although transforming growth factor β1 increased the USF1/USF2-E-box binding and P4Hα(I) promoter activity, this up-regulatory effect can be largely prevented by USF1/USF2-specific short interference RNA. On the other hand, cigarette smoking extracts, which have been shown to suppress P4Hα(I) expression, inhibited the binding between the USF1/USF2 and E-box, resulting in a reduced P4Hα(I) promoter activity. Furthermore, the E-box on the P4Hα(I) promoter appeared to indiscriminately bind with either USF1 or USF2, with a similar outcome on the promoter efficiency. In conclusion, our study shows that USF1/USF2 plays a critical role in basal P4Hα(I) expression, and both positive (transforming growth factor β1) and negative (cigarette smoking extract) regulators appear to influence the USF-E-box interaction and affect P4Hα(I) expression. Prolyl-4-hydroxylase α(I) (P4Hα(I)) is the rate-limiting subunit for P4H enzyme activity, which is essential for procollagen hydroxylation and secretion. In the current study, we have characterized the human P4Hα(I) promoter for transcription factors and DNA elements regulating P4Hα(I) expression. Using a progressive deletion cloning approach, we have constructed pGL3-P4Hα(I) recombinant plasmids. We have identified a positive regulatory region at the positions of bp –184 to –97 responsible for ∼80% of the P4Hα(I) promoter efficiency. Three E-boxes were located within this region, and the E-box at position bp –135 explains most of the regulatory capacity. Upstream stimulatory factors (USF1/USF2) were shown to bind on the E-box using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Suppression of USF1 and/or USF2 using specific short interference RNA resulted in a significant reduction in P4Hα(I) promoter activity, and overexpressed USF1 or USF2 increased P4Hα(I) promoter activity significantly. Although transforming growth factor β1 increased the USF1/USF2-E-box binding and P4Hα(I) promoter activity, this up-regulatory effect can be largely prevented by USF1/USF2-specific short interference RNA. On the other hand, cigarette smoking extracts, which have been shown to suppress P4Hα(I) expression, inhibited the binding between the USF1/USF2 and E-box, resulting in a reduced P4Hα(I) promoter activity. Furthermore, the E-box on the P4Hα(I) promoter appeared to indiscriminately bind with either USF1 or USF2, with a similar outcome on the promoter efficiency. In conclusion, our study shows that USF1/USF2 plays a critical role in basal P4Hα(I) expression, and both positive (transforming growth factor β1) and negative (cigarette smoking extract) regulators appear to influence the USF-E-box interaction and affect P4Hα(I) expression.

In arterial wall, ECM holds various types of cells, including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and fibroblasts, in their functional places. Dysregulated ECM is frequently associated with atherogenesis, vulnerable plaques, and aneurysm (1Stary H.C. Chandler A.B. Glagov S. Guyton J.R. Insull Jr., W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schaffer S.A.

ECM is maintained by a balanced synthesis and degradation of mainly collagens and elastins, which are in turn regulated by other molecules, e.g. fibrillin. Collagens form a multigene family with at least 39 members, the genes of which are known to be dispersed throughout at least 15 chromosomes. Collagen molecules consist of three identical or dissimilar polypeptide chains (called α chains) and contain at least one triple helical collagenous domain with repeating (GXY)n sequences, i.e. a glycine residue at every third amino acid, with the frequent presence of proline and 4-hydroxyproline in the X and Y positions, respectively. Most collagen molecules form supramolecular assemblies, and the superfamily can be divided into nine different families based on their polymeric structures or other features, such as collagens that form fibrils (types I–III, V, and XI). In normal arteries, fibrillar collagens I and III are the major constituents of the intima, media, and adventitia, whereas types I, III, IV, and V are in endothelial and VSMC basement membranes. The biosynthesis of the precursors of fibrillar collagens (called procollagens) involves a number of post-translational modifications. The intracellular modifications require five specific enzymes, three collagen hydroxylases (6Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and two collagen glycosyltransferases (8Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R.

Among these hydroxylases, prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H), a α2β2 heterotetramer, plays a key role in collagen metabolism. The β subunit is identical to the enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (6Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and is produced in excess of the α subunit, which contains a major portion of the catalytic sites of the enzyme, and the abundance of the α subunit restricts the enzymatic activity (6Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). P4H is an intracellular enzyme required for the synthesis and formation of all known types of collagen. It catalyzes the formation of hydroxyproline from proline residues located in repeating Xaa-Pro-Gly triplets in the procollagens during post-translational processing and is the process essential for folding the procollagen polypeptide chains into stable triple helical molecules (6Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the P4H enzymes generates unstable collagen that is degraded inside the cell and is not secreted, which is associated with reduced collagen production (5Rocnik E.F. Chan B.M. Pickering J.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of the P4Hα(I) gene is associated with excess collagen production (11John D.C. Watson R. Kind A.J. Scott A.R. Kadler K.E. Bulleid N.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). P4H isoenzymes are expressed in most tissues, although there may be tissue specificity with regard to type I or II isoforms for the α subunit (12Annunen P. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Veijola J.

Although relatively little data is available for factors affecting P4H expression and activity, P4H may be regulated by nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), insulin-like growth factor 1, β fibroblast growth factor, certain cytokines, and cigarette smoking (15Raveendran M.

Environmental stimuli, such as hypoxia, can induce P4Hα(I) expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which results in excess accumulation of collagen, a process relevant to fibrosis (23Takahashi Y.

In the present study, we characterized the elements in the promoter of human P4Hα(I). We found that the E-box-like sequence (CACGGG), which has been shown to bind upstream stimulatory factors (USF) (25Matsukawa T. Inoue Y. Oishi Y. Kato H. Noguchi T.

Upstream stimulatory factor (USF1/USF2) appears to be the transcription factor that controls the basal P4Hα(I) expression. Factors including TGFβ1 and cigarette smoking extract (CSE) up-regulated and down-regulated the USF-E-box interaction and affected P4Hα(I) expression. Plasmid Construction—pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison WI) was used to construct pGL-P4Hα(I) reporter vector to evaluate transcription efficiency. We used a PCR-based method to clone serially deleted P4Hα(I) promoter fragments into the pGL3-basic vector at the KpnI and HindIII sites. Genomic DNA from HeLa cells was used as the template for the cloning. The inserts were confirmed for the correct sequence and orientation by direct sequencing. We named each recombinant pGL3 vector according to the size of the inserted P4Hα(I) fragment (Table 1). The same antisense oligonucleotide primer that corresponded to the intron 1 region IVS1 + 76–IVS1 + 96 (5′-CCAAAGCTTACCACCACAGCGGGAAGGAAT-3′) was used for the generation of all of the clones. A KpnI linker was incorporated into the 5′-end of the sense primers, and a HindIII linker was incorporated into the 5′-end of the antisense primers. The digested PCR products were subcloned into pGL3-basic at KpnI and HindIII sites. The mutated construct pGL-145M was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using primers specifically introducing a mutation at the E-box site of the P4Hα(I) pGL-145 vector. The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are as follows (underlines refer to mutated nucleotides): sense 5′ AGC AGG GAG GCA CTC TCT TGG CGC CTG C-3; antisense 5′-GCA GGC GCC AAG AGA GTG CCT CCC TGC T-3′. The E-box mutation was confirmed by the direct sequencing. The USF1-pSG5 and USF2-pSG5 expression vectors were generous gifts from the laboratory of Dr. M. Sawadogo at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. Details of the vectors were described previously (28Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell.

Human aortic VSMCs were purchased from Cambrex BioScience, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). VSMCs were cultured in smooth muscle basal medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Cambrex BioScience, Inc.), and the cells in passages 6–8 were used for the experiments. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). One microgram of pGL-P4Hα(I) hybrid DNA and/or 1 μg of siRNA or USF-pSG5 were transfected into the cells cultured in a 6-well plate with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and 0.25 μg of pSVβgal (Promega), which expresses β-galactosidase, was co-transfected to allow normalization of the transfection efficiency. After 4 h, the cells were treated with or without 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 (Leinco Technologies, Inc., St. Louis, MO) for 24 h in the same medium but containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. We also treated the transfected cells with CSE as described previously (29Raveendran M. Wang J. Senthil D. Wang J. Utama B. Shen Y. Dudley D. Zhang Y. Wang X.L. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the smoke of a research cigarette (2R4F from Tobacco Health Research, University of Kentucky; nicotine, 0.85 mg/cigarette; tar, 9.70 mg/cigarette) was bubbled into a flask containing 20 ml of prewarmed F12K complete medium. The ignited cigarette was completely consumed in puffs by 10-ml syringe suction at one end of the tube within 5 min. The aqueous smoke extract was filtered through 0.2-μm syringe filter, and the pH of the CSE was adjusted to 7.4. The concentration of CSE was calculated in arbitrary units as cigarette equivalents/ml of the medium. CSE was used to treat the cells within 30 min of extraction. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and cell lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase activity was measured with an FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany) using luciferin (Promega) as the substrate. β-Galactosidase was assayed in an assay buffer (Promega), and the activity was measured at 420 nm in a spectrophotometer. The luciferase activity, which reflects the promoter activity, was normalized to the β-galactosidase to account for the variation in transfection efficiency. For siRNA transfection, 100 nm siRNA was transfected into the cells cultured in a 6-well plate with Lipofectamine 2000. The siRNA duplex (Integrated DNA Technologies, Houston, TX) sequences for USF1 were: sense, 5′-GAC CCA ACC AGU GUG GCU ATT-3′ and anti-sense, 5′-UAG CCA CAC UGG UUG GGU CTT-3′. The siRNA duplex sequences for USF2 were: sense, 5′-CCU CCA CUU GGA AAC GGU ATT-3′, and antisense, 5′-UAC CGU UUC CAA GUG GAG GTT-3′. As the negative control siRNA, we used scrambled siRNA designed and tested by Ambion, Inc. (catalog number 4611G, Austin, Texas), which has no significant sequence similarities to mouse, rat, or human gene sequences. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed using the histone H3 ChIP assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). In brief, ∼3 × 107 cells were used per ChIP assay. The cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were harvested by a brief centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Sonication was performed on ice using a Sonifier II 450 (Branson, Danbury, CT) with a 3-mm tip set at duty cycle 20 and an output level 2 to achieve chromatin fragments ranging between 200 and 1000 bp in size, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (a 20-μl aliquot was removed to serve as an input sample) followed with preimmunoprecipitation clearing with 80 μl of a mixture of salmon sperm DNA/protein A/protein G at 4 °C with rotation for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 2 μg of anti-USF1 or -USF2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight with rotation. After immunoprecipitation, 60 μl of a mixture of salmon sperm DNA/protein A/protein G was added and incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 30 min and followed by brief centrifugation. The precipitates were washed twice (5 min each at 4 °C) with low salt buffer, once with high salt buffer, and once with LiCl buffer. Then the precipitates were washed again with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl 1 mm EDTA) twice for 5 min each. The immune complexes were extracted three times with 200 μl of elution buffer. The eluates and the input were heated at 65 °C for at least 4 h to reverse the cross-link by the addition of 20 μl of 5 mol/liter NaCl. After proteinase K treatment, DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform solution and precipitated with ethanol. The recovered DNA was resuspended in 30 μl of H2O, and 4 μl was used for PCR. PCR was performed using sense (5′-AGC AGG GAG GCA CGG GCT TGG-3′) and antisense (5′-TAC TTC CTA CCC TCA GCC CGC-3′) primers. The PCR product (bp 183), which contained the USF binding E-box cis-element, was analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) served as the negative control in the assay. Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Primers were designed with Beacon Designer version 2.0 software. The primers for the human P4Hα(I) mRNA were: sense, 5′-CGT CTC CAG GAT ACC TAC AA-3′ and antisense, 5′-AAG CAG TCC TCA GCC GTT AG-3′. The primers for the housekeeping gene human β-actin were: sense, 5′-CTG GAA CGG TGA AGG TGA CA-3′ and antisense, 5′-AAG GGA CTT CCT GTA ACA ATG CA-3′. Total RNA was extracted from the cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA solution was treated with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase I (1 unit/μl; Promega) in a final volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 15 min to remove trace amounts of genomic DNA contamination. The DNase I was inactivated by incubation at 75 °C for 10 min. One microgram of total RNA was used for reverse transcription. The mRNAs were reverse-transcribed into cDNAs with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) containing a mixture of oligo(dT) and random primers. Real time PCR was performed using an iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system with a SYBR Green I Supermix kit (Bio-Rad) with the program running for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The PCR efficiency for the primers was examined by serially diluting the cDNA templates. The melting curve analysis was performed over the range 55–95 °C by monitoring SYBR Green fluorescence at increasing temperatures (0.5 °C increment changes at 10-s intervals). PCR-specific products were determined as a clear single peak, at the melting curves, of >80 °C. The specificity of primers was also confirmed as a single band with the correctly amplified fragment size through agarose gel electrophoresis of the real time RT-PCR products. Real time PCR was duplicated for each cDNA sample. Each gene mRNA level was acquired from the value of the threshold cycle (Ct) of the real time PCR as related to that of β-actin through the formula 2ΔCt (ΔCt = β-actin Ct–gene of interest Ct). Identification of a Positive Regulatory Element in the P4Hα(I) 5′-Flanking Sequence—To clarify the regions responsible for the basal transcriptional regulation of the P4Hα(I) gene, we prepared several reporter constructs by cloning the 5′-flanking sequence of the P4Hα(I) gene (Fig. 1A) into the upstream of the luciferase reporter. We then transfected HeLa cells with these constructs containing the progressively deleted 5′-flanking regions of the P4Hα(I) gene (Fig. 1B) and measured the luciferase activity of the resulting cell extracts. The deletion of the 5′-flanking sequence from bp –580 to –184 did not affect the transcription efficiency (Fig. 1B). However, a deletion up to bp –97 resulted in an ∼80% decrease in the transcription activity. These results suggest that the basal transcription of the P4Hα(I) gene was positively regulated by a region located between bp –184 and –97. One or more specific factors interacting with a cis-element(s) located between bp –184 and –97 may regulate the P4Hα(I) promoter efficiency. Effects of Mutation in the –135 E-box—Through a bioinformatics search, we have located three consensus E-box-like elements (CACGGG) located between bp –184 and –97. They are at bp –169, –158, and –135 (Fig. 1A). To confirm the importance of the E-boxes in P4Hα(I) gene transcription, we generated a wild-type pGL-145 (Fig. 2) and a mutated reporter gene construct pGL-145M in which the –135 E-box-like sequence (CACGGG) was mutated to CACTCT. We then transfected HeLa cells with the pGL-184, pGL-145, and pGL-145M vectors (Fig. 2). The deletion of the 5′-flanking sequence from –184 to –145, which removed the –169 and –158 E-boxes, did not affect the transcription efficiency. The mutation of the –135 E-box (pGL-145M), however, resulted in an ∼60% reduction in the activity. These results suggest that the basal transcription of the P4Hα(I) gene was positively regulated by the –135 E-box. Involvement of USF1/USF2 in the P4Hα(I) Promoter Activity—The USF is one of the main families of transcription factors binding to the E-box (30Kyriacou C.P. Rosato E. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2000; 15: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Calomme C. Nguyen T.L. de Launoit Y. Kiermer V. Droogmans L. Burny A. Van Lint C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8775-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of USFs in transactivating the P4Hα(I) promoter, we first examined the effects of silencing USF1 and USF2 by siRNAs on the activity of the P4Hα(I) promoter. Transfection of USF1 siRNA and/or USF2 siRNA into HeLa cells showed a significantly decreased pGL-145 promoter activity (Fig. 3A). Using HeLa cells, we further examined whether USF1/USF2 silencing could also suppress P4Hα(I) expression. Indeed, the mRNA levels of the P4Hα(I) gene measured by the quantitative real time RT-PCR were significantly reduced when USF1/USF2 were silenced (Fig. 3B). In the meantime, negative control siRNA had no effect on P4Hα(I) expression. Our experiments further demonstrated that the degree of inhibition by the USF1 or USF2 siRNA appeared to be similar, and treatment with both siRNAs did not induce any additive effect comparable to the reduction by a single siRNA. These results suggest that the transcription of the P4Hα(I) gene was positively regulated by the USF1/USF2, either one of which would be efficient for P4Hα(I) expression. We then overexpressed USF1 or USF2 in HeLa cells and human aortic VSMCs by co-transfecting pGL-145 vectors with USF1- or USF2-pSG5 vectors. As shown in Fig. 3C, USF1 and USF2 significantly up-regulated P4Hα(I) promoter activities as measured by luciferase activity in VSMCs. The same effect was also observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). In addition, USF1 appeared to induce a higher P4Hα(I) promoter activity than did USF2 (Fig. 3C). Such differential effect was not elucidated by the siRNA-mediated USF1 and/or USF2 suppression. Direct Binding of USF1/USF2 to the P4Hα(I) Promoter—To further assess the involvement of USF1/USF2 in P4Hα(I) transcription, we examined whether USF transcription factors could bind to the E-box in the P4Hα(I) promoter in vivo. The binding of E-box-binding proteins USF1/USF2 to the P4Hα(I) promoter was illustrated by the ChIP assay (Fig. 3D). We then examined the effect of USF1/USF2 silencing on the binding activity of the USF1/USF2 using the ChIP assay. We found a decreased binding activity of both USF1 and USF2 to the E-box (Fig. 3D). Meanwhile, the negative control siRNA had a minimal effect on the binding. Effects of TGFβ1 on P4Hα(I) Promoter Activity—P4Hα(I) has a central role in the biosynthesis of collagens. TGFβ1 can induce up-regulated collagen synthesis. To evaluate whether and how the P4Hα(I) promoter would respond to TGFβ1 stimulation, pGL-145 luciferase plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells. The normalized luciferase activity was calculated after TGFβ1 treatment. We found a 2-fold increase in the luciferase activity after TGFβ1 treatment (Fig. 4A). This effect was blocked by USF1/USF1 silencing using siRNAs (Fig. 4A), whereas negative siRNA had no effect. We further demonstrated the effect of TGFβ1 treatment on the P4Hα(I) mRNA levels in HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). We found a 1.8-fold increase in P4Hα(I) mRNA levels, and this effect was blocked by USF1/USF2 silencing using siRNA (Fig. 4B). The same effect was also shown in VSMCs (data not shown). ChIP assay showed TGFβ1 increased in the band intensity for the binding between the USF1/USF2 and the E-box in the P4Hα(I) promoter (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, negative control siRNA had no effect on the binding activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the transcription of the P4Hα(I) gene was positively regulated by TGFβ1 through the USF1/USF2 and E-box interaction. Effects of CSE on P4Hα(I) Promoter Activity—Previously, we have shown (15Raveendran M. Senthil D. Utama B. Shen Y. Dudley D. Wang J. Zhang Y. Wang X.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that CSE could down-regulate P4Hα(I) expression in endothelial cells and VSMCs. To evaluate the responsiveness of the P4Hα(I) promoter to CSE treatment, pGL-145 luciferase plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells, and the normalized luciferase activity was calculated after CSE treatment. We found an ∼50% reduction in the luciferase activity by the CSE treatment (Fig. 5A). We further showed that CSE also decreased the P4Hα(I) mRNA levels in HeLa cells (Fig. 5B), which was consistent with our previous report (15Raveendran M. Senthil D. Utama B. Shen Y. Dudley D. Wang J. Zhang Y. Wang X.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) on endothelial cells and VSMCs. ChIP assay demonstrated that CSE decreased the band intensity for the binding between the USF1/USF2 transcription factor and the E-box in the P4Hα(I) promoter (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the transcription of the P4Hα(I) gene was negatively regulated by CSE through USF1/USF2-E-box interaction. Because collagen is the major structural protein in the ECM, which provides the framework for all tissues including arteries, there is lit"

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway is also known to regulate these cellular processes. More importantly, respiratory toxicants and carcinogens activate both the PI3K-Akt pathway and FRA-1 expression in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. In this study we investigated a potential link between the PI3K-Akt pathway and the cigarette smoke (CS)-stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated FRA-1 induction in non-oncogenic HBE cells. Treatment of cells with LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K-Akt pathway, completely blocked CS-induced FRA-1 expression. Surprisingly pharmacological inhibition of Akt had no significant effect on CS-induced FRA-1 expression. Likewise the inhibition of protein kinase C ζ, which is a known downstream effector of PI3K, did not alter FRA-1 expression. We found that the PI3K through p21-activated kinase 1 regulates FRA-1 proto-oncogene induction by CS and the subsequent activation of the Elk1 and cAMP-response element-binding protein transcription factors that are bound to the promoter in HBE cells.

J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1194-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). Furthermore CS aggravates the incidence of other toxicant-induced respiratory disease (2Nelson H.H. Kelsey K.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7284-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the CS-promoted respiratory pathogenesis remain unclear, emerging data suggest a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in this process. PI3K regulates a number of diverse cellular responses, which include cell survival, motility and invasiveness (3Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar). PI3K stimulates the activation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinases-1/2 (PDK1/2), which then phosphorylate Akt at two critical threonine and serine residues. Phosphorylation of these residues is required for Akt activation (4Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Activated Akt phosphorylates various effector molecules. In addition to Akt, PI3K-dependent activation of MAP kinases, such as ERK1/2, and of certain PKC isoenzymes, such as PKCζ and PKCδ, has also been documented in various cell types (3Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar). CS and its individual components, such as NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) and nicotine, have been shown to activate PI3K-Akt pathway in vitro and in vivo (5West K.A. Brognard J.

Harris C.C. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover an elevated level of phosphospecific form of AKT (Ser473) has been found in pulmonary metaplasias and dysplasias (7Fiala E.S. Sohn O.S. Wang C.X. Seibert E. Tsurutani J. Dennis P.A. El-Bayoumy K. Sodum R.S. Desai D. Reinhardt J. Aliaga C. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), NNK-induced lung tumors (5West K.A. Brognard J. Clark A.S. Linnoila I.R. Yang X. Swain S.M. Harris C. Belinsky S. Dennis P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and human lung tumors derived from smokers (5West K.A. Brognard J. Clark A.S. Linnoila I.R. Yang X. Swain S.M. Harris C.

Jones J.L. O'Byrne K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 2930-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These data suggest a potential role for PI3K-Akt pathway in CS-induced respiratory pathogenesis. Consistent with this observation, an enhanced activity of Akt, a major downstream effector of PI3K, has been found in various cancer cell lines/tumor tissues (3Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar, 9Tran H. Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the downstream mechanisms of CS-induced P13K-Akt pathway are unclear. The activator protein-1 family of transcription factors (c-JUN, JUNB, JUND, c-FOS, FOSB, FRA-1, and FRA-2) regulate several cellular responses induced by various oxidants and toxicants (10Karin M. Shaulian E. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These proteins play key roles in the initiation and progression of tumors (11Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). However, the links between PI3K-Akt signaling and CS-induced activator protein-1 activation have not been defined in HBE cells. A high level of FRA-1 expression has been detected in various tumors and lung cancer cells (12Matsui M. Tokuhara M. Konuma Y. Nomura N. Ishizaki R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hu Y.C. Lam K.Y. Law S. Wong J. Srivastava G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2213-2221PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zajchowski D.A. Bartholdi M.F. Gong Y.

Care Med. 2002; 165: A828Google Scholar), and some known carcinogens, such as CS and asbestos, persistently activate FRA-1 expression in lung epithelial cells (16Reddy S.P. Mossman B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L1161-L1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that FRA-1 may play a key role in carcinogen-induced lung epithelial cell proliferation and transformation. For example, FRA-1 is required for asbestos-induced mesothelial cell transformation (17Ramos-Nino M.E. Timblin C.R. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6065-6069PubMed Google Scholar). It up-regulates the expression of genes coding for airway squamous cell metaplastic marker (18Patterson T. Vuong H. Liaw Y.-S. Wu R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (19Zhang Q. Kleeberger S.R. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L427-L436Google Scholar), and CD44 and c-met proto-oncogene (20Ramos-Nino M.E. Scapoli L. Martinelli M. Land S. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3539-3545PubMed Google Scholar), which are implicated in toxin-induced respiratory pathogenesis. FRA-1 controls cell motility, invasion, and maintenance and progression of the transformed state in several cell types (for reviews, see Refs. 11Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar and 21Tulchinsky E. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 921-928PubMed Google Scholar). Recently several studies demonstrated a critical role for this transcription factor in controlling both cell motility and invasiveness of several tumorigenic cell lines (22Kustikova O. Kramerov D.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1434-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mutational induction of FRA-1 gene in tumor tissues or cell lines is not known to date. Thus, an abnormal signaling and subsequent transcription factor activation may contribute to high level expression of FRA-1. Recently we have shown that metalloproteinase (MMP)-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated MAP kinase signaling plays an obligatory role in controlling CS-stimulated FRA-1 proto-oncogene induction in HBE cells (25Zhang Q. Adiseshaiah P. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the activation of PI3K-AKt pathway by cigarette smoke and NNK has been reported earlier by others (5West K.A. Brognard J. Clark A.S. Linnoila I.R. Yang X. Swain S.M. Harris C. Belinsky S. Dennis P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 6West K.A. Linnoila I.R. Belinsky S.A. Harris C.C. Dennis P.A.

Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), none of these studies showed the upstream signals that activate P13K pathway by CS and the subsequent downstream effectors that control activator protein-1 proto-oncogene induction. Here we show, for the first time, that EGFR-dependent PI3K-regulated CS-stimulated FRA-1 expression occurs through a PAK1-c-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway that culminates in the activation of transcription factors Elk1 and CREB independently of Akt. Reagents and Plasmids—Research-grade 1R4F cigarettes (9 mg of tar and 0.8 mg of nicotine/cigarette) without filters were obtained from the University of Kentucky Tobacco Research Institute. LY294002, AG1478, Akt inhibitor II (catalog number 124011), Akt inhibitor IV (catalog number 124008), rapamycin, rottlerin, and PKCζ myristoylated pseudosubstrate inhibitor (catalog number 539624) were from Calbiochem. GW5074 (catalog number G6416) was from Sigma. c-JUN (SC-45X), FRA-1 (SC-605X), and phospho-Elk1 (sc-8406) antibodies were all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Native and phosphospecific antibodies for c-JUN (Ser73), PDK1 (Ser241), Akt (Ser473), EGFR (Tyr845), CREB (Ser133), MEK1 (Ser217/221), c-Raf (Ser338), PAK1 (Thr423/402), and PKCζ (Thr410/403) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The 379-Luc construct was generated by cloning the -379 to +32 bp human FRA-1 upstream of the reporter firefly luciferase (Luc) gene. Mutations in the serum response element (SRE) (CArG mutant) and ATF binding sites in the context of 379-Luc were generated as described previously (26Adiseshaiah P. Peddakama S. Zhang Q. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4193-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A GST-tagged PAK1 vector (encoding amino acids 83-149), which acts as genetic mutant (27Li F. Adam L. Vadlamudi R.K. Zhou H. Sen S. Chernoff J. Mandal M. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), was provided by Rakesh Kumar (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Cell Culture and CS Exposure—The 1HAEo cell line, an SV40-transformed nonmalignant HBE cell line (28Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), was maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks (BD Biosciences) to 90% confluence, serum-starved for 14 h, and then exposed to mainstream CS as described previously (25Zhang Q. Adiseshaiah P. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, CS was drawn into a syringe-driven device and then delivered via the tube into cell culture flasks that were inverted to expose cells directly to smoke for 2 min. After that the flasks were restored to their original orientation so that the cells were covered with culture medium, and the flasks were placed in the 37 °C incubator. Throughout this study, we used CS at a dose of 2 cc/25-cm2 flask. No cell cytotoxicity was observed under the conditions of CS exposure. Kinase Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were exposed to CS for various time points, washed three times with chilled phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and then lysed in MAP kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies as indicated under “Results” and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 before probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified by densitometry. Kinase phosphorylation was normalized to that of total kinase protein levels and then expressed as a percentage of that untreated control. Immunoprecipitation of PAK1 and c-Raf—Cells were exposed to CS for various time points and then harvested in ice-cold cell lysis buffer. Lysates (∼200 μg) were incubated with 5 μl of anti-PAK1 or anti-c-Raf antibodies with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was precipitated using protein A-agarose beads (20 μl of 50% bead slurry) with gentle rocking for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the beads were washed with cell lysis buffer five times followed by addition of 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Beads were boiled for 5 min and then centrifuged to remove agarose beads prior to electrophoresis. The sample was analyzed by Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies anti-PAK1 and anti-c-Raf. Gene Expression Analysis—After CS exposure, cells were washed extensively with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and harvested into MAP kinase lysis buffer. Protein samples (∼40 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris buffer containing 0.1% Tween and 5% nonfat milk and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with FRA-1 antibody. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, and immunoreactive bands were detected using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped and probed with β-actin antibodies to ensure a comparable loading of extracts. For Northern blot analysis, after exposing to CS, total RNA was isolated from cells using the TRIzol reagent. RNA (∼15 μg) was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, blotted onto a Nytran membrane, and sequentially hybridized with 32P-labeled FRA-1 and β-actin cDNAs as probes as described previously (25Zhang Q. Adiseshaiah P. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The total amount of FRA-1 mRNA and protein in each sample was quantified with a Gel Doc 2000 system (Bio-Rad) and normalized to that of β-actin band. For transient transfections, cells were transfected with 100 ng of the -379 to +32 bp FRA-1 promoter reporter luciferase construct (hereafter abbreviated as 379-Luc, see Ref. 29Adiseshaiah P. Papaiahgari S.R. Vuong H. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47423-47433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar for details) along with 5 ng of the Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega Corp.). After overnight incubation, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then exposed to CS for 5 h, and luciferase activity was analyzed as described previously (25Zhang Q. Adiseshaiah P. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Serum-starved cells were exposed to CS, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (26Adiseshaiah P. Peddakama S. Zhang Q. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4193-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly the EMSAs were performed using 2-3 μg of nuclear extract in 20 μl of binding buffer on ice for 10 min prior to the addition of the appropriate 32P-labeled double-stranded oligo probe. After incubating for 30 min at room temperature, samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 2% glycerol. To demonstrate the presence of a specific protein in the complexes, nuclear extracts were mixed with 1-2 μg of anti-CREB (catalog number 06-519, Upstate Cell Signaling) antibodies and incubated on ice for 2 h prior to adding the probe. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were carried out as described earlier (26Adiseshaiah P. Peddakama S. Zhang Q. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4193-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly cells (∼1 × 107) were exposed to filtered air or CS for 60 min, and ChIP was performed using a commercially available kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Chromatin was cross-linked by adding formaldehyde (1%) to the tissue culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. A fraction of the soluble chromatin (1%) was saved for measurement of total chromatin input. Precleared chromatin was incubated with specific antibodies for 18 h at 4 °C. DNA recovered from the immunoprecipitated products was used as a template for PCR with FRA-1 promoter-specific primers (26Adiseshaiah P. Peddakama S. Zhang Q. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4193-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using t test and accepted at p < 0.05. All assays were performed in two or three (n = 2-3) independent samples, and each experiment was repeated at least two times. PI3K-mediated Signaling Is Required for CS-stimulated FRA-1 Expression—To determine whether the PI3K-mediated signaling is necessary for CS-induced FRA-1 expression, HBE cells were treated with LY294002 for 30 min and then exposed to CS for 3 h, and FRA-1 mRNA and protein expression was analyzed by Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous results (25Zhang Q. Adiseshaiah P. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), CS significantly (∼3-fold) stimulated the expression of FRA-1 mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein levels (Fig. 1B) as compared with the cells exposed to filtered air. However, pretreatment of cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 completely suppressed CS-induced FRA-1 mRNA expression. Previously we have shown that CS stimulates FRA-1 induction mainly at the transcription level, and the -379 bp promoter contains sufficient information to mediate such induction (26Adiseshaiah P. Peddakama S. Zhang Q. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4193-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To verify that PI3K signaling regulates FRA-1 transcription, cells were transfected with the 379-Luc promoter reporter construct along with the pRK-TL reference plasmid. Promoter activity in response to CS was analyzed in the absence or presence of LY294002 (Fig. 1C). As expected, CS significantly elevated luciferase activity, which was abrogated in the presence of LY294002. No effect of CS on the basal promoter activity was observed. Collectively these observations strongly support a prominent role for PI3K-dependent signaling in mediating the CS-stimulated FRA-1 transcription in pulmonary epithelial cells. CS Activates PI3K Signaling in HBE Cells—To determine whether CS activates PI3K signaling, we monitored the activation of PDK1 (Fig. 2A) and its downstream effector Akt (Fig. 2B). Cells were exposed to CS for 0-60 min, and equal amounts of total lysates from duplicate samples were separated by PAGE and immunoblotted using phosphospecific PDK1 (Ser241) and Akt (Ser473) antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, CS significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of PDK1 as early as 15 min of exposure (lanes 3 and 4); phosphorylation remained above the basal level through 60 min (lanes 7 and 8) compared with the control group (lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with this result, CS markedly stimulated the phosphorylation of the Ser473 residue of Akt (Fig. 2B) as early as 30 min (lane 2); phosphorylation stayed elevated above the basal level through 60 min (lane 3). A quantification of phosphorylated Ser473 signals on these blots revealed a 147 and 128% increase over the basal level at 30 and 60 min post-CS exposure, respectively. We also found that CS stimulates phosphorylation of Ser473 in another HBE cell line and in the lung tissues of mice exposed to CS (data not shown). Collectively these data suggest that CS stimulates the PI3K-Akt signaling, consistent with results reported by others in the lung cell types (5West K.A. Brognard J. Clark A.S. Linnoila I.R. Yang X.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CS Activates PI3K-Akt Pathway through EGFR—Recently we have shown that the activation of EGFR is essential for CS-stimulated FRA-1 induction (25Zhang Q. Adiseshaiah P. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given the observation that PI3K inhibitor completely blocks FRA-1 induction and EGFR-mediated signaling activates the PI3K-Akt pathway in response to growth factors in other cell types (30Fischer O.M. Hart S. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1203-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M. Nelson B.H. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7109-7120Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the activation of PI3K-Akt pathway was mediated through EGFR. Cells were treated with AG1478 prior to the exposure, and CS-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using phospho-Ser473 antibodies (Fig. 2C). AG1478 (lanes 7 and 8) completely inhibited CS-stimulated (lanes 3 and 4) Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly inhibition of EGFR activity with AG1478 significantly stimulated basal levels Akt phosphorylation (lanes 5 and 6) indicating a negative cross-talk between EGFR and Akt signaling in the unstimulated state. We have shown earlier that MMP activity is required for CS-stimulated EGFR mediated signaling in the lung. Consistent with this result, treatment of cells with MMP inhibitor GM6001 markedly blocked (Fig. 2D, lanes 7 and 8) CS-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4). Collectively these results suggest that signaling pathways involving EGFR and MMP regulate the activation of PI3K-Akt pathway in response to CS. Akt-mediated Signaling Is Not Required for CS-stimulated FRA-1 Induction—Enhanced Akt activity has been linked to tobacco-induced cellular responses (5West K.A. Brognard J. Clark A.S. Linnoila I.R.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and tumorigenesis (3Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar). Because both Akt and FRA-1 regulate cellular processes such as cell motility and invasiveness, we sought to determine whether Akt-dependent signaling was required for PI3K-mediated CS-stimulated FRA-1 induction. To examine this aspect, we used two pharmacological inhibitors of Akt, Akt inhibitor II and Akt inhibitor IV. Akt inhibitor II specifically inhibits the activation of Akt without affecting other upstream or downstream kinases (32Kozikowski A.P. Sun H. Brognard J. Dennis P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1144-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Akt inhibitor IV inhibits phosphorylation/activation of Akt by targeting its immediate upstream kinase, PDK1, but not PI3K (33Kau T.R. Schroeder F. Ramaswamy S. Wojciechowski C.L. Zhao J.J. Roberts T.M. Clardy J. Sellers W.R. Silver P.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 463-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We first examined the effects of these inhibitors on Akt-mediated signaling under our experimental conditions by monitoring the activation of glycogen synthase kinase, a major downstream target of Akt, in response to EGF. As shown in Fig. 3A, pretreatment of cells with either Akt inhibitor II (top panel, lanes 4 and 5) or Akt inhibitor IV (bottom panel, lanes 4-6) markedly suppressed EGF-stimulated glycogen synthase kinase phosphorylation (lanes 2 and 3). To confirm the specificities of these inhibitors, these membranes were stripped and probed with phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibodies. As anticipated, both Akt inhibitor II and Akt inhibitor IV had no significant effect on EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3A). To determine whether Akt-mediated signaling is required for FRA-1 induction, cells were exposed to CS in the presence or absence of either Akt inhibitor II or Akt inhibitor IV, RNA was isolated, and Northern blot analysis was performed. Neither Akt inhibitor II (top panel, lanes 4-6) nor Akt inhibitor IV (bottom panel, lanes 4-6) had an appreciable inhibitory effect on the CS-induced expression of FRA-1 mRNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, although CS-activates Akt, it is not required for regulating FRA-1 expression in response to CS. We next examined whether PKCζ, which is a known downstream targets of PI3K (3Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar), is involved in this process using the PKCζ myristoylated pseudosubstrate inhibitor (Fig. 3C). This inhibitor had no effect on CS-stimulated of FRA-1 expression. To determine whether or not CS-activates PKCζ, we monitored the levels of phosphorylation of this kinase using phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3D, CS stimulated the phosphorylation of PKCζ in HBE cells as early as 5 min (lane 2) compared with unstimulated cells (lane 1); phosphorylation remained above the basal level through 60 min (lane 5). However, pretreatment of cells with PI3K inhibitor markedly suppressed both basal (Fig. 3E, compare lane 1 and lane 3) and CS-stimulated PKCζ phosphorylation (Fig. 3E, compare lane 2 and lane 4). The PI3K Regulates CS-induced FRA-1 Expression via the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 Pathway—The above results indicate that PI3K regulates FRA-1 induction independently of Akt and PKCζ. Recently we have shown a critical role for ERK1/2-dependent signaling in controlling CS-stimulated FRA-1 expression in HBE cells (25Zhang Q. Adiseshaiah P. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because PI3K regulates ERK1/2 kinases in response to growth factors in several cell types (3Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar) and because EGFR activity is critical for CS-stimulated FRA-1 induction, we next examined whether PI3K induces FRA-1 through ERK1/2 signaling. Cells were treated with LY294002 prior to CS exposure, and CS-induced ERK1/2 kinase activation was assayed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A). PI3K inhibitor completely blocked CS-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. To further confirm"

Although Pak is primarily activated by Rac and Cdc42, there are additional proteins that regulate Pak activity and localization, including three AGC protein kinase family members, Akt-1, PDK-1, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. We describe phosphorylation and regulation of Pak localization by a fourth AGC kinase family member, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Using in vitro mapping, a phosphospecific antibody, co-transfection assays, and untransfected bovine aortic endothelial cells we determined that PKG phosphorylates Pak at serine 21. Phosphorylation was accompanied by changes in proteins associated with Pak. The adaptor protein Nck was released, whereas a novel complex with vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein was stimulated. Furthermore Ser-21 phosphorylation of Pak appears to be important for regulation of cell morphology. In both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HeLa cells, activation of PKG in the presence of Pak stimulated tail retraction and cell polarization. However, in cells expressing S21A mutant Pak1, PKG activation or treatment with a peptide that blocks Nck/Pak binding caused aberrant cell morphology, blocked cell retraction, and mislocalized Pak, producing uropod (tail-like) structures. These data suggest that PKG regulates Pak and that the interaction plays a role in tail retraction.

However, in some diseases including cancer, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis, control of these processes is lost resulting in improper endothelial vascularization (angiogenesis) (3Folkman J.

Consequently understanding the molecular mechanisms and signals that regulate endothelial cell motility and morphology may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, Pak is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and angiopoietins 1 and 2 to regulate angiogenesis, motility, and cell survival (8Master Z. Jones N. Tran J. Jones J. Kerbel R.S. Dumont D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Hood J.D. Frausto R. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. Cheresh D.A. J.

Microinjection of mutant forms of Pak such as dominant negative mutants or an inhibitory peptide called the Pak PID (Pak inhibitory domain, amino acids 83–149) reduces motility at multiple stages. These models suggest that Pak is required for motility by coordinating the formation of new adhesions at the front of the cell while detaching the rear of the cell by promoting tail retraction (15Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Pak contains a number of proline-rich regions that serve as docking sites for proteins with SH3 domains including Pix, Grb2, or Nck. In most cases, these proteins regulate Pak largely by controlling its subcellular localization. Nck is a 51-kDa protein that binds the N-terminal proline-rich region of Pak, is associated with Pak in endothelial cells, and is recruited to focal adhesions in vascular endothelial growth factor-treated cells (8Master Z. Jones N. Tran J. Jones J. Kerbel R.S. Dumont D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol.

When Nck/Pak binding is disrupted with peptides that interfere with the binding, endothelial cell migration, network formation in three-dimensional assays, and chick chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis are all inhibited (18Kiosses W.B. Hood J. Yang S. Gerritsen M.E. Cheresh D.A. Alderson N. Schwartz M.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore when Nck expression is blocked by antisense DNA, the assembly of focal adhesions is blocked (17Stoletov K.V. Ratcliffe K.E. Spring S.C. Terman B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22748-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These data indicate that Nck, through its regulation of Pak, is important in regulating endothelial cell migration and morphology. The most well characterized mechanism for regulation of Nck/Pak binding is by phosphorylation of serine 21 on Pak (19Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When Ser-21 is phosphorylated, which can come about either by autophosphorylation or by other kinases such as the AGC kinase family member Akt-1, Nck/Pak binding is disrupted (19Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Zhou G.L. Zhuo Y. King C.C. Fryer B.H. Bokoch G.M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8058-8069Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The AGC family of kinases include protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), protein kinase C, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG is a serine/threonine kinase activated by the short lived second messenger cGMP. Activation is rapid and transient because cGMP is rapidly degraded by intracellular phosphodiesterases thereby enabling PKG to serve as a rapid yet transient transducer of extracellular signals. In endothelia, NO or phosphodiesterase inhibitors rapidly elevate cGMP levels and stimulate PKG. This causes changes in endothelial cell permeability and motility (21Feil R. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H. Walter U. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Given the importance of both PKG and Pak in regulating endothelial cells, we wished to determine any cross-regulation between the kinases. In this study, we demonstrated that PKG phosphorylates Pak at Ser-21, disrupts Nck/Pak binding, alters Pak localization, and causes remodeling of focal adhesions. Additionally we demonstrated a novel phosphorylation-dependent association between Pak and the PKG substrate, Ena/Mena family member, and actin cytoskeleton-regulatory protein: vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Through regulation of these processes, PKG phosphorylation of Pak regulates HeLa cell and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) morphology and cellular remodeling.

HUVECs (passages 2–6), bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) (passages 3–8), endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2) and endothelial growth medium-2 were from BioWhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD). To raise a Pak1 phospho-Ser-21-specific antibody, rabbits were immunized with the peptide PPMRNTpSTMIGAG (where pS represents phosphoserine), and postimmune serum was collected by Invitrogen and affinity-purified over a peptide column. The peptide Tat-Pak S21 (YGRKKRRQRRRGKPPAPPMRNTSTM) and the serine 21-phosphorylated form Tat-Pak pS21 (YGRKKRRQRRRGKPPAPPMRNTpSTM) were synthesized by ALPHA Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). Plasmids—Plasmids expressing a Myc-tagged wild-type (WT) Pak1 and a kinase-dead (KD) (K299R) version of Pak1 based on the pCMV6 vector have been described elsewhere (22Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged alanine mutant (S21A) Pak1 in a pCMV6 vector was a generous gift from Gary Bokoch (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid pMM9 expressing a wildtype PKG 1β was kindly forwarded from Suzanne Lohmann (Wurzburg, Germany) by Renate Pilz (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) (23Meinecke M. Geiger J. Butt E. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Chakraborty T. Walter U. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar) as was the baculovirus encoding a wild-type PKG 1β (24Pohler D. Butt E. Meissner J. Muller S. Lohse M. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jarchau T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein of Pak is a fusion of the WT Pak1 with a GFP gene fused to its C terminus cloned into the KpnI site of the pcDNA3 vector. The site-directed mutagenesis kit used to make a site-specific mutant serine 21 to alanine construct of the GFPPak (GFP-S21A-Pak1) was from Stratagene, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The plasmid pd2EGFP-N1, which expresses GFP alone, was from Clontech. Protein Purification—Pak1 fragments were purified as either glutathione S-transferase or His fusion proteins from Escherichia coli strain BL21 following standard procedures. To express and purify Pak1 proteins (WT and mutants) from baculovirus, constructs were made by using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit. The constructs were sequenced by the Cell Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The infection of insect cells (Sf9) was carried out by a facility at the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA). His-tagged Pak1 proteins were purified from insect cell extracts under native conditions with Ni-NTA-agarose by following the procedures supplied by Qiagen. Briefly, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a column filled with Ni-NTA-agarose, the column was then washed, and the protein was eluted with elution buffer containing a higher concentration of imidazole. To express and purify PKG, the method described previously was used (24Pohler D. Butt E. Meissner J. Muller S. Lohse M. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jarchau T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 insect cells were grown as monolayers and infected with baculovirus for 48 h. The insect cells were scraped, gently centrifuged to a pellet, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed by brief sonication in 1 ml of buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor). After1hof centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was applied to a column filled with cAMP-agarose. The column was then washed with sonication buffer, and the protein was eluted with sonication buffer containing 30 mm cAMP. The eluent was dialyzed against buffer containing 25% glycerol (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor) and stored at –80 °C. Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were conducted by incubating proteins, as indicated in the figure legends, with 20 μm ATP in kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2,40mm HEPES, pH 7.4) in a reaction volume of 25 μl. Reactions were initiated by adding 20 μm ATP in some cases with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The reactions were terminated with 25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 or 293T cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin G/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection of COS-7 or 293T cell lines, cells were split, grown for a day to 60–80% confluence, and transfected with FuGENE as recommended. For each well of a 6-well (35-mm dish) plate, cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of WT Pak1 plasmid along with 0.75 μg of PKG 1β plasmid. pCMV6 vector was used to control for total transfected DNA. Cells were allowed to express proteins for 24 h after DNA was added. Cells were washed in 37 °C DMEM three times and serum-starved in DMEM 18–24 h. To harvest, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, washing was followed by the addition of 0.8 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF,1mm Na3VO4) containing the recommended concentration of Complete protease inhibitor, and the mixture was agitated in the wells on ice for 5 min. The lysis mixture was transferred into centrifuge tubes and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as cell lysate and used immediately. BAECs were split and grown for 1 day in endothelial growth medium-2 in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours after replating, the cells were washed twice with 37 °C EBM-2 and treated with water or 500 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP in serum-free EBM-2 for 15 min or 1 h. The cells were then lysed with lysis buffer. The lysis mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected, run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted for phospho-Ser-21 Pak, and total Pak1. Immunoprecipitation of Pak—To immunoprecipitate Pak, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged wild-type or KD (K299R) Pak1 along with PKG 1β. Pak was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total protein in COS-7 or 293T cell lysates by rotation incubation for 2 h with mouse anti-Myc or rabbit anti-N-20 Pak antibody and protein A/G PLUS-agarose in 150–200 μl of lysis buffer at 4 °C. After incubating the mixture for 2 h, the beads were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 10 s at 4 °C. The pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated Pak1 was detected with either mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc (9E10) or a rabbit polyclonal Pak antibody (N-20) by Western blot. Assays for Nck/Pak or VASP/Pak Association—To test the association of Nck and Pak1 or VASP and Pak, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged wild-type or KD (K299R) Pak1 along with PKG 1β. Endogenous Nck protein was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total protein in 293T cell lysates by rotation incubation for 2 h with mouse anti-Nck and protein A/G PLUS-agarose in 150–200 μlof lysis buffer at 4 °C. After incubating the mixture for 2 h, the beads were collected by centrifugation at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 s at 4 °C. Endogenous VASP protein was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total protein in 293T cell lysates by rotation incubation for 18–20 h with mouse anti-Nck and protein A/G PLUS-agarose in 150–200 μl of lysis buffer at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 10 s at 4 °C. The pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer. The Myc-tagged Pak1 coimmunoprecipitated with Nck was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc (9E10) or Pak antibody (N-20) on a Western blot. Immunofluorescence—HUVECs were split and grown for 1 day in endothelial growth medium-2 in 6-well plates and then transfected with a plasmid expressing Myc-Pak1 or Myc-S21A-Pak1 along with PKG plasmid and GFP vector. Two micrograms of PKG (or vector), 2 μgof Pak plasmids (or vector), 0.66 μg of GFP plasmid, 10 μl of FuGENE, and 100 μl of EBM-2 were combined and used for each well. Eighteen hours after DNA was added, cells were trypsinized and replated into a Nunc chamber slide precoated with fibronectin; 24 h after replating, the cells were washed twice with 37 °C EBM-2 and treated with water or 500 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP in serum-free EBM-2 for 30 min or 2 h. The cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min followed by 20 min of permeabilization with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated with 100 μl of PBS containing 6 μl of Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin 20 min at room temperature. After being washed several times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the samples were mounted and observed under a Nikon TE2000-U inverted fluorescence microscope. Micrographs were taken on a Roper Scientific CoolSnap Pro-cf camera operated with Image Plus software from Phase 3 Imaging Systems (Glen Mills, PA). Live Cell Video Microscopy—HeLa cells were split and grown for 1 day on 6-well plates until subconfluent and then transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-Pak1 or GFP-S21A-Pak1 along with PKG plasmid or vector by using FuGENE 6 as recommended. Two micrograms of PKG (or vector) and 1 μg of Pak plasmids (or GFP vector) were used for each well. Seven hours after DNA was added, cells were trypsinized and replated into a Delta T 0.17-mm glass dish from Bioptech (Butler, PA) that was pretreated with fibronectin. Eighteen to 24 h after adding the DNA, the cells were washed twice with 37 °C DMEM, placed under the microscope on a Delta T dish heater (Bioptech), and treated with 500 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP in serum-free DMEM for 1 h. Cells were observed under a Nikon TE2000-U inverted fluorescence microscope. Micrographs were taken on a Hamamatsu camera operated with Image Plus software from Phase 3 Imaging Systems. HUVECs were treated as above except that they were transfected with plasmid expressing Myc-Pak1 or Myc-S21A-Pak1 along with PKG plasmid and GFP vector by using FuGENE 6.

We hypothesized that PKG, another AGC kinase family member, also phosphorylates Pak1. To test this hypothesis, we incubated recombinant Pak1 and PKG, both purified from baculovirus, in an in vitro [γ-32P]ATP kinase assay, separated the reactions on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed protein phosphorylation by autoradiography (Fig. 1A). Because Pak1 autophosphorylates when activated, we tested Pak1 K299R, a KD mutant of Pak1, to eliminate the variable of Pak kinase activity on Pak itself. We noted that PKG phosphorylated Pak1. To determine the region of Pak that was being phosphorylated we tested a number of Pak1 fragments for phosphorylation by PKG (Fig. 1B). Overlapping fragments of Pak1 covering the entire protein were tested. The best substrate for PKG was the fragment covering the N-terminal portion of Pak, amino acids 1–74. PKG did not phosphorylate a fragment encompassing amino acids 67–149 and only weakly phosphorylated fragments from the central region of Pak1 encompassing amino acids 147–231 and the C-terminal catalytic region, amino acids 231–544 (constructed in a KD mutant to prevent autophosphorylation) (Fig. 1B). Because phosphorylation of these fragments was weak, they were not pursued. We also noted that phosphorylation of the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–74) was considerably better than that observed with Akt1 (data not shown). Because the most highly phosphorylated fragment of Pak1 was the N-terminal portion, we wished to identify the residue phosphorylated by PKG within fragment 1–74. Because Akt phosphorylates serine 21 on Pak1 we ran an in vitro [γ-32 P]ATP kinase assay with PKG and fragment 1–74 of Pak containing a mutation from serine to alanine at amino acid 21. The S21A mutant fragment was phosphorylated much less readily by PKG than the original fragment (Fig. 1C). To confirm the data with fragments, we incubated purified full-length KD Pak1 and S21A-Pak1 with PKG in an in vitro [γ-32P]ATP kinase assay and then analyzed the reactions on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel by autoradiography (Fig. 1D). Again we observed that PKG phosphorylated Pak1; however, the phosphorylation was not seen in the S21A mutant Pak. We also confirmed PKG phosphorylation of Pak at serine 21 with a phosphospecific antibody. To do this, we incubated recombinant baculovirus wild-type Pak1, a kinase-dead Pak1 (K299R), and a S21A/K299R mutant Pak with PKG in a non-isotopic ATP kinase assay, separated the proteins on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and detected phosphate incorporation by Western blot (Fig. 1E). Again we observed a signal at serine 21 when PKG was incubated with Pak1, whereas no signal was detected with the S21A mutant Pak1. As a control for the phosphospecific antibody, we probed the same samples with a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes threonine 423, a major phosphorylation site on Pak (Fig. 1E). Although there was a slight Thr-423 phosphorylation of KD Pak treated with PKG, the S21A-Pak did not have a signal, suggesting that the observed signal may be due to cross-reactivity of the Thr-423 antibody with serine 21. In this experiment, the wild-type Pak1 was highly phosphorylated at Thr-423, and activated PKG did not affect the signal. The signal in the wild-type protein is probably due to partial activation of Pak in baculovirus. Note that PKG was also recognized by this antibody, which cross-reacts with a number of related kinases. From these experiments we conclude that PKG, like Akt, phosphorylates Pak at serine 21 in vitro and does not phosphorylate Thr-423. To determine whether PKG phosphorylated Pak1 in cells we searched for a Pak kinase activity in BAECs. BAECs provide a good model to study the endogenous effects of PKG because they express PKG, unlike other endothelial cell lines. For the assay, we treated BAECs with cGMP for 15 or 60 min. We then lysed the cells, ran the lysate on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and detected serine 21 phosphorylation by Western blot (Fig. 1F). Only in cells treated with cGMP were we able to detect serine 21 phosphorylation. Thus, in untransfected BAECs, cGMP stimulated phosphorylation of Pak at serine 21. PKG Does Not Immediately Affect Pak Activation—To test whether PKG stimulates phosphorylation of Pak in vivo, we conducted a time course dosing of 500 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP in COS-7 (Fig. 2, A and B) and 293T (Fig. 2C) cells transfected with WT PKG 1β and/or WT Pak1 plasmids. We observed similar results in both cell types, but because the signal was more robust in 293T cells, most experiments were performed in these cells. Treated cells were lysed, a portion of the lysate was incubated with Myc antibody to immunoprecipitate Pak, and the sample was then Western blotted. Additionally we probed cell lysate Western blots for PKG and Myc to confirm PKG and Pak expression (Fig. 2A and data not shown.) Using the Ser-21-phosphospecific antibody, we observed that PKG stimulated serine 21 phosphorylation on Pak1. We used the known PKG substrate VASP as a positive control. Phosphorylation of VASP at serine 239 increased through4hof treatment with 500 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP as measured with a VASP Ser-239-phosphospecific antibody. However, in positive controls from cells co-transfected with Pak and Q61L activated Rac, Rac stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-21 on Pak1 but had no effect on VASP phosphorylation"
https://openalex.org/W1968377708,"Gq/11 protein-coupled muscarinic receptors are known to regulate the release of soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPα) produced by α-secretase processing; however, their signaling mechanisms remain to be elucidated. It has been reported that a muscarinic agonist activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB, a transcription factor that has been shown to play an important role in the Alzheimer disease brain, and that NF-κB activation is regulated by intracellular Ca2+ level. In the present study, we investigated whether NF-κB activation plays a role in muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release enhancement and contributes to a changed capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), which was suggested to be involved in the muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of sAPPα release. Muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation was confirmed by observing the translocation of the active subunit (p65) of NF-κB to the nucleus by the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine M (oxoM), in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells expressing muscarinic receptors that are predominantly of the M3 subtype. NF-κB activation and sAPPα release enhancement induced by oxoM were inhibited by NF-κB inhibitors, such as an NF-κB peptide inhibitor (SN50), an IκBα kinase inhibitor (BAY11-7085), a proteasome inhibitor (MG132), the inhibitor of proteasome activity and IκB phosphorylation, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, the novel NF-κB activation inhibitor (6-amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenylethylamino) quinazoline), and by an intracellular Ca2+ chelator (TMB-8). Furthermore, both oxoM-induced NF-κB activation and sAPPα release were antagonized by CCE inhibitors (gadolinium or SKF96365) but not by voltage-gated Ca2+-channel blockers. On the other hand, treatment of cells with NF-κB inhibitors (SN50, BAY11-7085, MG132, or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) did not inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated CCE. These findings provide evidence for the involvement of NF-κB regulated by CCE in muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release enhancement.

APP normally undergoes proteolytic cleavage within the Aβ sequence liberating the α-secretase-cleaved APP (sAPPα). Although evidence indicates that sAPPα plays important roles in regulating neuronal survival and plasticity, the mechanisms that mediate these biological activities and the regulation of sAPPα secretion have not been established. The transcriptional nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) responds to a large number of environmental cues, and in the nervous system, it is modulated under physiological and pathological conditions, which include developmental cell death and acute of chronic neurodegenerative disorders (1Barkett M.

It was proposed that NF-κB or other κB-binding proteins may be involved in a neuroprotective change in gene expression evoked by various cytokines and by secreted APP in neuronal cells, and therefore, may have a positive effect on Alzheimer disease (3Barger S.W.

The most common form of NF-κB consists of a heterodimer of p50 (NF-κB1) and p65 (Rel A) (12Sen R. Baltimore D.

In most resting cells, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm by its association with inhibitor molecules of the IκB family (16Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 16-18Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The formation of NF-κB-IκB complex masks the nuclear localization signal sequence in NF-κB and thus prevents its nuclear translocation. In response to various stimuli, NF-κB dimers are released from cytoplasmic IκB proteins by a process involving site-specific phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteolytic degradation via the 26 S proteasome pathway (6Stein T.D.

Capacitative calcium entry (CCE), which is mediated by Ca2+-permeable channels termed store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs), was reported to require the sustained activation of a nuclear factor of activated T cells, an NF-κB-like molecule on T cells (22Stankunas K.

Little information on the mechanism of NF-κB regulation by muscarinic stimulation is known, especially in neuronal cells. Moreover, in neuronal cells, the involvement of CCE in muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation or vice versa is little understood. Our recent data indicated that CCE is involved in the regulation of muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release (25Kim J.H. Choi S. Jung J.-E. Roh E.-J. Kim H.-J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and we postulated that NF-κB might be an important signaling molecule in the regulation of muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release. Therefore, in the present study, we examined how NF-κB and CCE are involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Materials—SN50, BAY11-7085, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), MG132, 8-diethylaminooctyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8), and 6-amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenylethylamino) quinazoline (QNZ) were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 1-(2-(5-Carboxyoxazol-2-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran-5-oxy)-2-(21-amino-51-methylphenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N1,N1-tetra-acetic acid penta-acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) and 4′, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and oxotremorine M (oxoM) was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Desalting columns (PD-10) and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies to sAPPα (clone 6E10), recognizing the amino acid residues 1-17 of APP, were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA), and anti-pre A4 monoclonal antibodies to sAPP (clone 22C11), which recognize the amino terminus of APP, were purchased from Roche Applied Science. A fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human NF-κB monoclonal anti-p65 antibody (sc8008) recognizing an epitope mapping to the amino terminus of human NF-κB P65 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and goat anti-rabbit antibody used in Western blot analysis were purchased from Sigma. The other reagents used from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Mammalian Cell Cultures—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC CRL-2266) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in humidified conditions under 5% CO2. Media were changed twice weekly, and cultures were split in the ratio of 1:5 weekly. For experiments, SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 6- or 12-well plates for 24 h. The medium was then removed and replaced with fresh medium without serum, and the cells were maintained for the time periods indicated. Measurement of sAPPα Release—sAPPα release was measured as described by Nitsch et al. (26Nitsch R.M. Slack B.E. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Science. 1992; 258: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, cells were cultured to confluency in multiwell dishes (6-well format). Prior to drug addition, cells were washed with serum-free media and pretreated with various agents in serum-free media for 30 min following which they were treated with oxoM in serum-free media for 1 h. Conditioned media from wells were centrifuged to remove debris, desalted, dried, and reconstituted in SDS loading buffer. Total cell protein per dish was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Reconstituted culture media protein extracts containing the same amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted using antibodies 22C11 (1:125) or 6E10 (1:200), and bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Data collection and processing were performed using a luminescent image analyzer LAS-1000 and IMAGE GAUSE software. Measurement of Changes in [Ca2+]i—[Ca2+]i levels were determined in suspensions of fura-2/AM-loaded cells. Briefly, confluent cells were harvested, washed with a buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 40 mm sucrose, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.3), and resuspended in 4.0 ml of the same buffer. Cells were then placed in a quartz microcuvette in a thermostat-controlled cell holder. Fura-2/AM was added to a final concentration of 5 μm, and the cells were then incubated with continuous gentle stirring for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Supernatants containing extracellular fura-2/AM were removed following gentle centrifugation of 0.5-ml aliquots, and cells were washed three times. They were then resuspended in 1 ml of buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to further centrifugation and resuspension in 4.5 ml of buffer at 37 °C. Experiments were performed at 37 °C. For Ca2+-free experiments, the same buffer was used, but CaCl2 was omitted. Fluorescence was monitored using fura 2-loaded cells in a Shimadzu RF-5301 spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD) using the dual wavelength method of Grynkiewicz et al. (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm every 0.5 s). Data are expressed as ratios of fura-2 fluorescence at 340 versus 380 nm (F340/F380). Preparation of Cytosolic and Nuclear Extracts—Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected as cytosolic protein extracts. To prepare nuclear extracts, the pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.05 mm vanadate, and the protease inhibitor mixture. After extraction on ice for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant, containing nuclear proteins, was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, an aliquot was removed for protein determination, and samples were stored at -20 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed using a double-stranded 15-bp oligonucleotide (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) containing the NF-κB binding motif, which was radiolabeled as described previously (28Unlap T. Jope R.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 198: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the binding reaction, nuclear protein extract (10 μg) was incubated in a total volume of 20 μl in binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and radiolabeled (about 10,000 cpm) DNA for 30 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved in a pre-electrophoresed 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. Subsequently, the gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to film. Immunolocalization of P65 Proteins—SH-SY5Y cells on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Translocation of p65 to the nucleus was assessed after fixing stimulated (with 1 mm oxoM for 1 h) and unstimulated cells by overnight incubation with an FITC-conjugated anti-human NF-κB monoclonal anti-p65 antibody (sc-8008, 1:50) at 4 °C followed by a 3-min incubation with DAPI for nuclear staining. Fluorescence images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss Co., Oberkochen, Germany) using a 505 nm long path filter for emission and an argon ion laser for excitation (488 nm). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons between controls and treated groups were performed using the Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Muscarinic Receptor-mediated NF-κB Activation in SH-SY5Y Cells—NF-κB is activated by physical and chemical stresses, viruses, bacteria, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (29Ghosh S. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and it is also activated by a novel mechanism through the stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors as was shown in isolated canine gastric parietal cells (30Todisco A. Ramamoorthy S. Pausawasdi N. Tadey K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined whether muscarinic receptor stimulation can lead to the activation of NF-κB in SH-SY5Y cells by measuring NF-κB binding activities using EMSA. NF-κB was detected as two major bands, which increased after treating the cells with the muscarinic receptor agonists, carbachol or oxoM, as reported previously in SH-SY5Y cells (31Li X. Song L. Jope R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5914-5922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, muscarinic agonist-induced NF-κB activation was abolished by excess unlabeled NF-κB oligomer (Fig. 1). This result shows that muscarinic receptor stimulation induces the activation of NF-κB in SH-SY5Y cells. NF-κB is activated by the posttranslational modification of an inactive cytosolic complex that contains p50, p65, and one of several inhibitory subunits that is generally designated as IκB (32Gillmore T.D. Morin P.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Upon appropriate cell stimulation, the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB, IκBα, is rapidly phosphorylated and undergoes proteolytic breakdown by proteasomes, thereby permitting NF-κB to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (33Matthews J.R. Hay R.T.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 865-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The presence and function of NF-κB in cells of the nervous system are poorly documented, for example, as compared with lymphocytes. To obtain information on the mechanism of NF-κB activation mediated by muscarinic receptors in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, we carried out immunocytochemistry for the p65 subunit of NF-κB in cells pretreated with muscarinic receptor agonist and/or antagonist. The FITC-labeled p65 subunit, which was located in the cytosol, was translocated to the nucleus after treatment with the muscarinic agonist oxoM. Moreover, pretreatment with atropine, a muscarinic antagonist, reversed the oxoM-induced translocation of p65. To confirm that the muscarinic receptor-mediated translocation of p65 into the nucleus represents NF-κB activation, we used several NF-κB inhibitors, which differently block intracellular NF-κB activation pathways. SN50 is a cell-permeable peptide, which inhibits NF-κB by blocking its translocation to the nucleus (34Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). BAY11-7085 is an IκBα kinase inhibitor, and PDTC is known as a copper binding compound that inhibits proteasome activity and IκB phosphorylation (35Daniel K.G. Chen D. Orlu S. Cui Q.C. Miller F.R. Dou Q.P. Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: R897-R908Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 36Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). TMB-8 is known to inhibit NF-κB activation by blocking intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and chelating intracellular Ca2+ (37Wang R. Zhang L. Zhang X. Moreno J. Celluzzi C. Tondravi M. Shi Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Kim Y.H. Moon J.S. Lee K.S. Park S.Y. Cheong J.H. Kang H.S. Lee H.Y. Kim H.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Int. 2004; 44: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and the novel NF-κB activation inhibitor (QNZ, IC50 = 15 nm) was found to inhibit the activation of NF-κB by an unknown mechanism (40Tobe M. Isobe Y. Tomizawa H. Nagasaki T. Takahashi H. Hayashi H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 3869-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 2B, muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation was inhibited by all NF-κB activation inhibitors tested. Involvement of NF-κB Activation in the Regulation of Muscarinic Receptor-mediated sAPPα Release—It was reported that the activation of muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3) increases sAPPα release (26Nitsch R.M. Slack B.E. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Science. 1992; 258: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 41Slack B.E. Nitsch R.M. Livneh E. Kunz G.M. Breu J. Eldar H. Wurtman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21097-21101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also confirmed muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release in SH-SY5Y cells. The secretion of sAPPα to culture medium was significantly increased by treating oxoM in a time-dependent manner, and this oxoM-induced sAPPα release was blocked by pretreating with 10 μm atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist (Fig. 3A). Several studies have shown that sAPPα can stimulate the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (3Barger S.W. Mattson M.P. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Guo Q. Robinson N. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12341-12351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and sAPPα induced neurotrophic and excitoprotective actions mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt kinase, and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (42Cheng G. Yu Z. Zhou D. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 175: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, it has not been reported whether NF-κB activity can regulate sAPPα release. Therefore, to examine the involvement of NF-κB in the regulation of muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release in SH-SY5Y cells, we tested whether the suppression of NF-κB activation could antagonize sAPPα release enhancement by muscarinic receptor activation. The oxoM-induced increase of sAPPα release was found to be concentration-dependently inhibited by all of the NF-κB inhibitors tested: SN50, BAY11-7085, QNZ, TMB-8, PDTC, or MG132 (Fig. 3). MG132 is an inhibitor of proteasome activity (43Grisham M.B. Palombella V.J. Elliot P.J. Conner E.M. Brand W. Wong H.L. Pien C. Mazzola L.M. Destree A. Parent L. Adams J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Regulation of Muscarinic Receptor-mediated NF-κB Activation by Extracellular Ca2+ Influx through CCE—Cells respond to various types of stimulation with a remarkable diversity of [Ca2+]i signals. Ca2+ is a highly pleiotropic second messenger that plays an important role in a wide variety of cellular events. One of the important functions of Ca2+ is to activate signaling pathways that lead to the expressions of genes (44West A.E. Chen W.G. Dalva M.B. Dolmetch R.E. Kornhauser J.M. Shaywitz A.J. Takasu M.A. Tao X. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11024-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 45West A.E. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Although it is known that Ca2+ is involved in the induction of NF-κB activity following various stimuli in diverse types of cells, it is not known whether muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation can be regulated by CCE through SOCs in SH-SY5Y cells. Therefore, we examined whether CCE is involved in muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB translocation to the nucleus. NF-κB translocation to the nucleus by oxoM was blocked by Gd3+ or SKF96365, both of which are known potent inhibitors of SOC (46Fernando K.C. Barritt G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 47Merritt J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 48Mason M. Mayer B. Hymel L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C564-C662Crossref Google Scholar), but was not blocked by Cd2+, or nifedipine, both voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel inhibitors (Fig. 4). These results indicate that CCE plays a key role in NF-κB activation induced by muscarinic receptor stimulation and that NF-κB is engaged in muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release. Relationship between NF-κB Activation and CCE Stimulation Mediated by Muscarinic Receptor Stimulation—Because it was found that NF-κB activity regulates muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release and that CCE regulates muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation in SH-SY5Y cells, we investigated whether NF-κB activation affects muscarinic receptor activation-induced Ca2+ entry by examining the effects of the NF-κB inhibitors, QNZ, TMB-8, SN50, BAY11-7085, PDTC, and MG132, on the intracellular Ca2+ responses evoked by oxoM. After preincubation in Ca2+-free buffer containing 1 mm oxoM (to deplete Ca2+ stores), the re-addition of Ca2+ induced CCE, and this oxoM-induced CCE stimulation was inhibited by QNZ (a newly synthesized NF-κB inhibitor with an unknown mechanism) (Fig. 5A). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, pretreatment with QNZ also led to a significant reduction in the second phase of plateau Ca2+ entry (considered as CCE) of the oxoM-induced [Ca2+]i response, without reducing transient initial Ca2+ release (Fig. 5B). Similar experiments were carried out using an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, TMB-8. In Ca2+-free buffer, TMB-8 abolished all oxoM-induced [Ca2+]i responses including Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and the Ca2+ entry induced when Ca2+ was restored to the medium (Fig. 5C). Also, in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, both the initial transient Ca2+ release phase and the plateau Ca2+ entry phase of [Ca2+]i response during oxoM application were completely abolished by TMB-8 pretreatment (Fig. 5D). On the other hand, other NF-κB inhibitors including the proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and PDTC, a translocation inhibitor, SN50, and an IκB kinase inhibitor, BAY11-7085, which inhibited sAPPα release evoked by muscarinic receptor activation in SH-SY5Y cells, did not inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx via CCE both in Ca2+-free-buffers (Fig. 5E) and in Ca2+-containing buffers (Fig. 5F). Results indicate that CCE induced by muscarinic receptor activation is not mediated by NF-κB. Therefore, the NF-κB activation pathway is downstream of CCE induced by muscarinic receptor activation, leading to enhancement of sAPPα release. Although large secreted β-APP (sAPPα) is well known to play important roles in the regulation of neuronal survival and plasticity, the signal transduction mechanisms that mediate its release or biological activities are still not established. Numerous studies have demonstrated that stimulation of phospholipase C-linked G-protein-coupled receptors, including muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors, increases the release of the sAPPα by α-secretase cleavage. The purpose of this research was to determine whether muscarinic receptor stimulation activates NF-κB in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing abundant M3 muscarinic receptors and whether such muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation is involved in sAPPα release and contributes to change the CCE, which our recent data (25Kim J.H. Choi S. Jung J.-E. Roh E.-J. Kim H.-J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) indicate plays an important role in the muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of sAPPα release. Although the muscarinic agonist carbachol has previously been shown to activate NF-κB in isolated canine gastric parietal cells (30Todisco A. Ramamoorthy S. Pausawasdi N. Tadey K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the activation of NF-κB appears to be an important event in numerous intracellular inflammatory processes, there is insufficient evidence about correlating NF-κB and muscarinic receptor in neuronal cells. Therefore, we first confirmed that muscarinic receptor stimulation evoked the activation of NF-κB in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by observing that muscarinic receptor agonists increased NF-κB binding activity (Fig. 1) and induced the translocation of p65 a subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 2), which is a direct evidence of NF-κB activation. Given that muscarinic receptor stimulation increases sAPPα release and NF-κB activation, it is unclear whether this stimulation induces sAPPα release and subsequent NF-κB activation or vice versa. We observed that increased sAPPα release by oxoM was suppressed dose-dependently by pretreating with various NF-κB inhibitors with different mechanisms of NF-κB activation (Fig. 3). This result provides evidence that the NF-κB pathway is involved in the regulation of muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release and that cross-talk exists between sAPPα release and NF-κB activation after muscarinic receptor activation. It was reported that several neuroprotective genes and proteins are markedly up-regulated in mice overexpressing APP (49Stein T.D. Johnson J.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7380-7388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that NF-κB, which is known to have a neuroprotective role, is a signaling molecule responsible for sAPPα release by facilitating the secretase process. It has been reported that exposure to sAPPα protects hippocampal neurons against Ca2+-mediated damage (3Barger S.W. Mattson M.P. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and against Aβ-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells expressing mutant presenilin-1 (4Guo Q. Robinson N. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12341-12351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) by inducing activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. It can be assumed that secreted sAPPα increased by muscarinic agonist-induced NF-κB activation may then further activate NF-κB in disease state such as Alzheimer disease. NF-κB activation is modulated under both physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, the activation of NF-κB before an experimental insult, such as exposure to glutamate, glucose deprivation, β-amyloid peptide, or oxidative molecules, has been shown to protect neurons against apoptosis (1Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 2Mattson M.P. Culmsee C. Yu Z. Camandola S. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The results of the present study show that muscarinic receptor stimulation in the absence of such apoptotic or critical conditions in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells induced NF-κB translocation to the nucleus. Several studies have demonstrated that various transcription factors are regulated by intracellular Ca2+ movement (19Dolmetsch R.E. Xu Keli Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 21Lilienbaum A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2680-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 51Miyakawa-Naito A.

We observed that extracellular Ca2+ influx (CCE) via SOC, which is functionally coupled with endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ depletion, plays a key role in muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release (25Kim J.H. Choi S. Jung J.-E. Roh E.-J. Kim H.-J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, we attempted to characterize the nature of the Ca2+ influx that participates in muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation by administering Ca2+ channel blockers. Nonselective and selective voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blockers had no effect, but SOC blockers inhibited muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 4). This finding suggests that the CCE induced by muscarinic receptor stimulation regulates NF-κB activation. The activation of cell surface receptors coupled to phospholipase C, including muscarinic (M1 and M3) receptors, leads to the generation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and allows Ca2+ to be released into the cytosol (52Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar). Numerous studies, including our study, have shown that the activation of muscarinic receptors with a maximal concentration of agonist (100 μm-1 mm) induced a biphasic [Ca2+]i rise, composed of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed by Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space (i.e. CCE). NF-κB responds to intracellular Ca2+ elevation by stimulating several kinds of ligands (21Lilienbaum A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2680-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 53Tomsig J.L. Sohma H. Creutz C.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested to determine whether muscarinic receptor-mediated CCE is affected by NF-κB inhibitors. Our results show that CCE response to muscarinic receptor activation is not blocked by most NF-κB activation inhibitors except ones acting via intracellular Ca2+-regulating pathway, such as TMB-8, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator. The newly synthesized NF-κB inhibitor with quinazoline moiety, QNZ, may inhibit CCE by altering [Ca2+]i and then lead to the inhibition of NF-κB activation. The results from the present study suggest that CCE induced by muscarinic receptor activation is upstream of the NF-κB activation pathway that participates in muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release. Camandola et al. (54Camandola S. Cutler R.G. Gary D.S. Milhavet O. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22287-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) recently reported that activation of NF-κB in fibroblasts and neurons leads to decreased levels of the type I inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and decreased Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. They also observed no change in the magnitude of CCE analyzed in fibroblast cells lacking NF-κB p65/RelA subunit after exposure to thapsigargin in Ca2+-free medium, which correlates well with our result showing no blockade of muscarinic receptor-mediated CCE by NF-κB inhibitors in SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, NF-κB activation plays a role in muscarinic receptor-mediated sAPPα release, muscarinic receptor-mediated NF-κB activation is regulated by CCE, and the CCE produced by muscarinic receptor stimulation is not influenced by NF-κB in SH-SY5Y cells. It is assumed that the sAPPα release enhanced by NF-κB activation via CCE produced by muscarinic receptor stimulation may protect neurons against Aβ-induced cell death by further activation of NF-κB stabilizing Ca2+ homeostasis through down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release responses. NF-κB-mediated sAPPα release following muscarinic stimulation can provide a potential therapeutic mechanism for muscarinic agonists in Alzheimer disease.

Individual PAS proteins are known to control morphogenesis, circadian rhythmicity, responses to hypoxia and toxin metabolism. These proteins contain a bHLH motif, which mediates dimerization with other bHLH proteins and contributes to determining DNA binding specificity. The PAS domain, named after the founding members of this family (period-arylhydrocarbon nuclear translocator-single minded), is a multifunctional protein surface responsible for such diverse activities as ligand binding, PAS protein dimerization, and non-PAS protein interactions (1Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition to environmental adaptation, some members of the bHLH-PAS family regulate development. In Drosophila, single-minded (sim) acts as the master regulator of central nervous system midline development by controlling expression of many genes required for differentiation. Similar to other bHLH-PAS proteins, sim functions as a heterodimer with arnt (2Crews S. Franks R. Hu S. Matthews B. Nambu J. J. Exp. Zool. 1992; 261: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This complex binds to central midline elements (CME) in the regulatory regions of target genes to activate expression of proteins required for proper central midline establishment (2Crews S.

These proteins share a high degree of similarity in their PAS domains, but little conservation is apparent in their carboxyl termini. Sim1 and Sim2 interact with Arnt, but differ from Drosophila sim, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) by functioning as transcriptional repressors (7Moffett P.

Sim1 and Sim2 are expressed in a variety of tissues including brain, kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle where they play important developmental roles.

Antonarakis S.E. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This splice variant, which is missing exon 11 and therefore lacks a portion of the region implicated in mediating the repressive effects of SIM2, is reported to be involved in cancer susceptibility (10Deyoung M.P. Scheurle D. Damania H. Zylberberg C. Narayanan R. Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 3149-3157PubMed Google Scholar, 11DeYoung M.P. Tress M. Narayanan R. Cancer Lett. 2003; 200: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, functional differences between these two isoforms have not been reported. Because the bHLH-PAS proteins share structural motifs and common binding partners, it is not surprising that cross-talk can occur between PAS-protein-mediated pathways. In the case of the HIF proteins, both Sim1 and Sim2 can compete with HIFs for Arnt binding, and interact with a prototypical hypoxia response element (HRE) to affect gene expression (7Moffett P. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Moffett P. Reece M. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4933-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Woods S.L. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10236-10243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sim1/Arnt, but not Sim2/Arnt, can induce transcription of an HRE-controlled reporter gene via the COOH-terminal transactivation domain of Arnt (12Woods S.L. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10236-10243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, Arnt-mediated transactivation of a CME-controlled reporter gene is severely impaired in the presence of Sim2 and is dependent upon the Sim2 dimerization domain and carboxyl terminus, which contains two separate repressive domains (7Moffett P. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Moffett P. Reece M. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4933-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because repression by Sim2 is not specific for Arnt, as Sim2-Gal4 fusion constructs have repressive effects on a thymidine kinase promoter (9Chrast R. Scott H.S. Chen H. Kudoh J. Rossier C. Minoshima S. Wang Y. Shimizu N. Antonarakis S.E. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it is thought that Sim2-mediated repression can also occur through direct interactions with the basal transcription machinery. Similar to Drosphilia sim, Sim1 and Sim2 also bind and regulate transcription through a consensus CME, which is not surprising because the CME core sequence (5′-ACGTG-3′) is identical to that of the HRE. As was seen for the HRE, Sim1 strongly activates transcription of a CME-controlled gene through the transactivation domain of Arnt, whereas Sim2 is repressive (7Moffett P. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have isolated a splice variant of mouse Sim2 that corresponds to the human Sim2s transcript, and have characterized its expression profile and transcriptional properties. Mouse Sim2s is expressed at high levels in adult kidney and skeletal muscle but in different ratios with respect to full-length Sim2. Like Sim2, Sim2s interacts with Arnt, but is slightly less efficient at binding Arnt2. These differences in expression pattern and binding partner preference may prove significant, as we have also determined that Sim2s and Sim2 differ dramatically in their ability to regulate expression of genes under control of hypoxia, dioxin, and central midline response elements. Animals and Cell Culturing—Female C57Bl/6J mice were housed under standard 12-h lights on/off conditions in a temperature and humidity controlled facility with food and water provided ad libitum. All animal housing and treatments were approved by and conformed to the Animal Use Protocols at Texas A&M University. All cell lines were maintained in a 37 °C humidified incubator in a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2. HEK-293T and HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was initially isolated from mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and was further purified using RNeasy kits (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 3′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT)-based adapter primer (AP-dT17) (5′-GATCAGGACGTTCGTTTGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). An initial round of PCR was performed using 1 μl of a 1:100 dilution of the RT reactions with the adapter primer (AP) (5′-GATCAGGACGTTCGTTTGAGT-3′) and a Sim2-specific primer located in exon 9 (P1, 5′-AGTCCCAGGAGTCCTGGA-3′). Subsequent rounds of PCR were performed on 1μl of a 1:100 dilution of the previous reaction using the adapter primer and nested Sim2 primers (P2, 5′-AAATCAGCTAAACCCAAAAACACAAA-3′; P3, 5′-AGAACCAACCCATATCCCC-3′; P4, 5′-CTTCTCCTGTGAATGCTGC-3′). The PCR products were cloned into pCR II-TOPO (Invitrogen), and screened for inserts by restriction enzyme analyses. Clones positive for insert were sequenced (DNA Technologies Lab, Texas A&M University) and compared with reported mouse Sim2 and chromosome 16 sequences. The sequence of the Sim2s 3-RACE product was submitted to GenBank™ and was assigned accession number AY963781. RT-PCR—PCR contained 1 μl of cDNA template with 1 μm each primer, 0.4 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) per 25-μl reaction. Primers used were: Sim1 (FP, 5′-GGTCAGCCAGTGAATCTGGT-3′; RP, 5′-TGGTCTCCTGCTGTCTGATG-3′), Sim2s (FP, 5′-AAATCAGCTAAACCCAAAAACACAAAGATG-3′; RP, 5′-TCCCTGTGAGGTCACGAATA-3′), Sim2 (FP, 5′-AAATCAGCTAAACCCAAAAACACAAAGATG-3′; RP, 5′-TAGTGGCCGCAGCTCGGGAA-3′), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (FP, 5′-CTAACATCAAATGGGGTGAGG-3′; RP, 5′-TCATACTTGGCAGGTTTCTCC-3′). The identity of each PCR product was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and/or sequencing (DNA Technology Lab, Texas A&M University). Real Time PCR—Real time PCR was performed using 2× SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each 25-μl reaction contained 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green master mixture, 500 nm each of forward and reverse primers, and 2 μl of a 1:50 dilution of reverse transcriptase reaction. Following an initial 10-min denaturation step at 95 °C, samples were submitted to 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data were collected using SDS software, and analyzed by the ΔΔCT method. Primers used were: panSim2 (FP, 5′-TCACGTCTTCAGCAGCAAGAA-3′; RP, 5′-AGAAGCGTGCCACCTCACA-3′), Sim2s (FP, 5′-AACCAGCTCCCGTGTTTGAC-3′; RP, 5′-ACTCTGAGGAACGGCGAAAA-3′), Sim2 (FP, 5′-TCTGAGCCTTCTCCTGTGAATG-3′; RP, 5′-CGGAGGGCGCTTCATAGTT-3′), β-actin (FP, 5′-GCAACGAGCGGTTCCG-3′; RP, 5′-CCCAAGAAGGAAGGCTGGA-3′). Plasmid Construction—The full-length mouse Sim2s plasmid (pcDNA-mSim2s) was made by amplifying the 5′ most 1548-bp of Sim2 from pmSim2-GAL4-HA (kindly provided by Dr. Jerry Pelletier, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) using HiFi Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and the primers 5′-ATGAAGGAGAAGTCCAAAAATGC-3′ and 5′-AGCATTCACAGGAGAAGGCTCAGAA-3′. This fragment was cloned into pCR II-TOPO, and the 5′ SpeI fragment was cut out and ligated to SpeI/XbaI cut pCRmSim2s-8 (original Sim2s 3′ RACE clone) to create pCRFLmSim2s. After the sequence was confirmed, the entire insert was removed by EcoRI digestion, and cloned into EcoRI-cut pcDNA3. pmSim1-HA and pmSim2-HA were a kind gift of Dr. Jerry Pelletier. All yeast two-hybrid plasmids utilized pGBK-T7 and pGADT7-Rec as the DNA-binding and activation plasmids, respectively (Clontech, Carlsbad, CA). For mouse Sim2s yeast two-hybrid plasmids, the full-length insert of pCRFLmSim2s was removed by EcoRI digestion and ligated to EcoRI-cut vectors. Full-length Sim2L was removed from pmSim2-GAL4-HA by EcoRI digestion and cloned into EcoRI-cut vectors. Full-length Arnt and Arnt2 were amplified from mouse kidney and cloned into pCR II-TOPO. Once the sequences were verified, the inserts were removed and cloned into pGBK-T7 and pGADT7-Rec. Reporter Plasmids—pDRE-TATA-luc, pGL2-TATA, and pβ-galactosidase were kindly given to us by Dr. Stephen Safe (Texas A&M University) (13Morrow D. Qin C. Smith 3rd, R. Safe S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 88: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). pHRE-TATA-luc was constructed by cloning annealed oligonucleotides corresponding to the top and bottom strands of the hypoxia-responsive region of the EPO promoter into pGL2-TATA (14Chun Y.S. Yeo E.J. Choi E. Teng C.M. Bae J.M. Kim M.S. Park J.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). pCME-luc was a kind gift of Dr. Jerry Pelletier. Yeast Two-hybrid Liquid Culture Assay—One hundred ml of YPDA were inoculated with 10 ml of an overnight AH109 yeast culture (Clontech) and grown to an A600 of ∼0.6. Cells were spun down and washed two times in 50 ml of sterile water and once in 2 ml of 1 m cold sorbitol. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of 100 mm LiAc/TE containing 25 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following an additional 1 m sorbitol wash, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 m sorbitol and mixed with plasmids on ice (50 μl of cells plus 250 ng of each plasmid). Cells were transformed by electroporation with a 5-ms pulse at 1.5 kV, 50 microfarads, and 100 ohm. One ml of YPD was added to transformed yeast, which were then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Cells were spun, and resuspended in 100 μl of 1 m sorbitol and plated onto DOB/-Leu/-Trp plates and incubated at 30 °C until colonies appeared. Double dropout broth liquid cultures of three colonies from each plate were grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking. Fresh media was inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture and incubated at 30 °C with shaking until cells reached log phase (A600 of the cultures between 0.5 and 0.8). At this point, the A600 of each culture was recorded and 1.5 ml of yeast were spun and washed in Z buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0). Cells resuspended in 100μl of Z buffer were subjected to three cycles of freezing/thawing for 60 s each in liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath. Seven hundredμl of Z buffer containing 4 mm β-mercaptoehanol and 160 μl of Z buffer containing 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside was added to each tube and the reactions were placed at 30 °C for 60 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 400 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 and the time of reaction recorded. The OD420 of each reaction was recorded and β-galactosidase activity calculated using the equation β-galactosidase units = 1000 × OD420/(t × V × A600), where t = elapsed time (in min) of incubation, V = 0.1 ml × concentration factor, and A600 = A600 of 1 ml of culture. Data are expressed as the average of three separate colonies ± S.E. Co-immunoprecipitation—Full-length Arnt, Arnt2, Sim2, and Sim2s were made from pcDNA3-based expression plasmids using an in vitro translation kit (Promega). Sim2 and Sim2s were made in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Five μl of Arnt or Arnt2 product were mixed with 15 μl of radiolabeled Sim2 or Sim2s and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 2 h. Five μg of anti-Arnt (Upstate), anti-Arnt2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or rabbit IgG (Upstate) were added, and the volumes were increased to 150 μl with water and 2× co-immunoprecipitation buffer to make a 1× solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% IGEPAL). Following a 2-h incubation at room temperature, 20 μl of agarose A bead slurry was added and samples were incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h with gently mixing. Beads were recovered at 5000 rpm for 1 min, and washed 3 times in 500 μl of 1× co-immunoprecipitation buffer. Final pellets were resuspended in loading buffer, boiled, and separated on polyacrylamide gels. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to film for 1 week. Transient Transfection—Sim2 and Sim2s expression was confirmed by Western analyses before large-scale experiments were conducted. For each transfection, cells were seeded at 4 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates the day before transfection. The following morning, 200 ng of the appropriate reporter plasmid was co-transfected with 100 ng of internal control (pβ-galactosidase) and various amounts of test plasmids using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours later, cells were incubated under hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic (21% O2) conditions (pHRE-TATA-luc transfected HEK-293T cells) or in the presence of vehicle (Me2SO) or 10 nm 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (pDRE-TATA-luc transfected HepG2 cells) for 40 h. Cells were harvested, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of the cell lysates were determined by dual luciferase assay using Luciferin (Molecular Probes) and Galacto-Light (Tropix, Applied Biosystems). Luciferase activities were normalized to the internal control values and are represented as the mean ± S.E. for three wells per condition. Significant differences were determined using Student's t test. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Twenty-four h after transfection, formalin (270 μl/10 ml of medium) was added to HEK-293 cells and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Following a series of phosphate-buffered saline washes, cells were scraped and recovered by centrifugation. Cells (500,00 cells per ChIP assay) were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA) and sonicated on ice. Chromatin was recovered, and mixed with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl) containing 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche). Chromatin was cleared twice by incubation with agarose bead slurry at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation. Antibody was added (10 μg for Sim2, 1 μg for IgG) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with mixing. Agarose bead slurry was added and reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with mixing. The agarose beads were recovered and washed successively for 5 min at 4 °C in low salt (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA), high salt (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA), LiCl (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 250 mm LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA), and TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) buffers. Chromatin was eluted at room temperature by incubation in freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) for 15 min. Samples were then treated with RNase A in the presence of 200 mm NaCl and cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h. Chromatin was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K. DNA was purified using Qiaquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen) and eluted in 50 μl of sterile water. PCR detection of pGL2-CME immunoprecipitation targets was performed in 25-μl reactions containing 2 μl of chromatin and the primers pGL2-ChIP-F1 (5′-CCCCCTGAACCTGAAACATA-3′) and pGL2-ChIP-R1 (5′-GCCTTATGCAGTTGCTCTCC-3′). Thermocycling was done with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 27 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s followed by a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. Previous studies have identified a splice variant of human SIM2; however, a similar isoform has not been reported in mice, nor have functional differences between Sim2 and Sim2s been reported. To better characterize biochemical and physiological differences between Sim2 and Sim2s in mice, we set out to identify the mouse Sim2s transcript. Total RNA from mouse kidney and liver tissues were used for 3′ RACE experiments because Sim2 is expressed at high levels in the kidney, but not in liver. A unique adapter primer (AP-dT17) was used to reverse transcribe total RNA from the tissues. This reaction was then used as a template for PCR using a primer directed to the AP region of the 3′ adapter and a Sim2-specific forward primer (P1, Fig. 1A). Subsequent PCR were performed on diluted PCR products using the AP and nested Sim2-specific primers (P2–P4, Fig. 1A). The resulting PCR products from each reaction were submitted to restriction enzyme analyses for predicted sites to support the identity of the PCR products as Sim2 (Fig. 1B). Potential Sim2 clones with predicted restriction digest products were only obtained in kidney, and were too small to be full-length Sim2. In humans, the SIM2s splice variant is missing exon 11, and contains an extension of exon 10 (9Chrast R. Scott H.S. Chen H. Kudoh J. Rossier C. Minoshima S. Wang Y. Shimizu N. Antonarakis S.E. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence of mouse chromosome 16 near the region of mouse Sim2 exon 10, a single HaeIII site is predicted to be present in the Sim2s transcript. This was confirmed in the fourth round 3′ RACE PCR product (Fig. 1B, right panel) suggesting that this clone is the mouse homolog of human SIM2s. 3′ RACE clones were sequenced and compared with reported mouse Sim2 sequences and chromosome 16. Like the human form, mouse Sim2s is missing exon 11 and contains an extension of exon 10 (Fig. 2A). The mRNA (Fig. 2B) is predicted to encode a protein of 579 amino acids that is missing the last 131 amino acids and contains an additional 53 amino acids encoded by the “s” exon (Fig. 2C). Mouse Sim2s still contains the Ser/Thr- and Pro/Ser-rich regions shown previously to harbor repressive activities, but is missing the Pro/Ala-rich repressor region present in full-length Sim2 (8Moffett P. Reece M. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4933-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mouse and human Sim2s share 86% identity at the RNA level, and are 87% homologous at the protein level. Interestingly, the s portions of mouse and human Sim2s are not as homologous as the rest of the gene (Fig. 2C). The mRNA and protein sequences of mouse and human Sim2 from start to the end of exon 10 are 88 and 91% homologous, respectively. However, the DNA and protein sequences of the extended exon 10 regions of mouse and human Sim2s are only 45 and 20% homologous, respectively. Despite these differences, a few amino acid residues remain conserved, including 545GGGW548 and 561SASK564. Sim expression was analyzed in mouse tissues by RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR (Fig. 3). Sim1 was expressed at high levels in kidney, brain, lung, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Sim2 and Sim2s were expressed at high levels in kidney and skeletal muscle. The ratio of Sim2s and Sim2 mRNA expressed in kidney and skeletal muscle appeared to differ, suggesting that their expression is controlled in a tissue-specific manner. Therefore, expression of both isoforms of Sim2 were determined in kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle by RT-PCR using a common forward primer located in exon 9, and both Sim2- and Sim2s-specific reverse primers located in exons 11 and s, respectively. As expected, neither Sim2 isoform was detected in liver, but kidney and skeletal muscle expressed both Sim2 and Sim2s in different relative amounts (Fig. 3B). In agreement with our initial analyses (Fig. 3A), kidney expressed slightly more Sim2s than Sim2, whereas skeletal muscle expressed significantly more Sim2 than Sim2s. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analyses of kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle RNA for total Sim2 (Fig. 3C), Sim2s (Fig. 3D), and full-length Sim2 (Fig. 3E) corroborated our PCR analyses and found that, overall, skeletal muscle contains significantly higher levels of full-length Sim2 mRNA than kidney. The utility of the yeast two-hybrid system in addressing functional interactions between Sim genes and other PAS proteins has been well established (6Probst M.R. Fan C.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4451-4457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To begin assessing if Sim2 and Sim2s differ in their transcriptional properties, we took advantage of the two-hybrid liquid culture assay. Chimeras containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain (pGBK-based plasmids) in-frame with mouse Arnt, Arnt2, Sim2, or Sim2s were transfected into AH109 yeast in various combinations with constructs containing these genes in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain (pGAD-based plasmids). Positive interactions between the introduced proteins “reconstitutes” the GAL4 transcription factor leading to increased expression of a LacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4 activation sequence. High levels of LacZ expression were observed when GBK-Arnt and GAD-Arnt were co-transfected into yeast (Table 1) supporting the observation that Arnt can homodimerize (15Sogawa K. Nakano R. Kobayashi A. Kikuchi Y. Ohe N. Matsushita N. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Significantly less LacZ activity was seen in GBK-Arnt-GAD-Arnt2 transfected cells suggesting that ARNT does not interact as well with Arnt2. Both the long and short forms of mouse Sim2 interacted with Arnt, and to a lesser extent with Arnt2. Interestingly, the degree of these interactions was dependant upon which protein was coupled to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 as LacZ activity was less in GBK-based Sim constructs interacting with GAD-based Arnt and Arnt2 than GBK-based Arnt and Arnt2 constructs interacting with GAD-based Sim constructs (Table 1). These observations may be due to the repressive nature of the Sim2 proteins, or steric hindrance induced by the tertiary structure of the Sim2-GAL4AD protein.TABLE 1Interactions between mouse Arnt, Arnt2, Sim2, and Sim2s in the yeast two-hybrid liquid culture assaypGADT7ArntArnt2Sim2Sim2spGBKT70.20 ± 0.09NDaND, not determined.NDNDNDArnt0.56 ± 0.3818.31 ± 0.449.648 ± 4.028.14 ± 1.6110.94 ± 0.13Arnt22.59 ± 0.730.77 ± 0.012.33 ± 0.262.02 ± 0.333.22 ± 0.86Sim20.89 ± 0.092.09 ± 0.070.85 ± 0.161.07 ± 0.061.43 ± 0.42Sim2s0.48 ± 0.211.55 ± 0.160.77 ± 0.070.91 ± 0.090.89 ± 0.2a ND, not determined.

[35S]Methionine-labeled Sim2 and Sim2s proteins were mixed with cold Arnt or Arnt2 and complexes were precipitated with antibodies directed against Arnt or Arnt2. Anti-Arnt antibody was able to pull down both Arnt/Sim2 and Arnt/Sim2s complexes at relatively comparable levels (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, anti-Arnt2 antibody was able to pull down Sim2 slightly more efficiently than Sim2s (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Although IgG control samples show some Arnt binding (Fig. 4, lane 5), there was very little Sim2 or Sim2s pulled down by nonspecific binding (Fig. 4, lane 6).

https://openalex.org/W1992876087,"ARK5 is a tumor progression-associated factor that is directly phosphorylated by AKT at serine 600 in the regulatory domain, but phosphorylation at the conserved threonine residue on the active T loop has been found to be required for its full activation. In this study, we identified serine/threonine protein kinase NDR2 as a protein kinase that phosphorylates and activates ARK5 during insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling. Upon stimulation with IGF-1, NDR2 was found to directly phosphorylate the conserved threonine 211 on the active T loop of ARK5 and to promote cell survival and invasion of colorectal cancer cell lines through ARK5. During IGF-1 signaling, phosphorylation at three residues (threonine 75, serine 282, and threonine 442) was also found to be required for NDR2 activation. Among these three residues, phosphorylation of serine 282 seemed to be the most important for NDR2 activation (the same as for the mouse homologue) because its aspartic acid-converted mutant (NDR2/S282D) induced ARK5-mediated cell survival and invasion activities even in the absence of IGF-1. As in the mouse homologue, threonine 75 in NDR2 was required for interaction with S100B, and binding was in a calcium ion- and phospholipase C-γ-dependent manner. We also found that PDK-1 plays an important role in NDR2 activation especially in the phosphorylation of threonine 442. Based on the results of this study, we report here that NDR2 is an upstream kinase of ARK5 that plays an essential role in tumor progression through ARK5.

Thus, ARK5 appears to be an important factor for tumor progression.Serine/threonine protein kinase AMPK acts as the metabolic sensor in a wide variety of species, for example in mammalian cells, insect cells, and yeast, and its activation has usually been observed in cells exposed to metabolic stress, such as hypoxia and nutrient starvation, and in skeletal muscle cells during exercise (7Hardie D.G.

In addition to their role in these disease states, we recently reported that AMPKs and related kinases play an essential role in tumor progression (1Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T.

AMPKs, especially AMPK-α1, have been reported to be activated by the upstream kinase through the phosphorylation of the threonine residue on the active T loop. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CaMKKs) have been reported to be the upstream kinases that activate AMPK-α (16Hamilton S.R. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Hammet A. Stapleton D. Habinowsky S.A.

It has also been reported that LKB1 acts as the master kinase of all AMPK catalytic subunit family members in cells under metabolic stress (22Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A.

We and other research groups, however, recently reported LKB1-independent phosphorylation of AMPK catalytic subunit family members in cells stimulated with growth factor (23Suzuki A. Kusakai G.

Physiol. 2004; 287: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The same as other AMPK family members, ARK5 contains a highly conserved active T loop, suggesting the presence of an upstream kinase that phosphorylates the threonine residue in the catalytic domain. Activation of ARK5 by growth factors, as well as metabolic stress, is important to understand the mechanisms of ARK5 regulation under physiological and pathological conditions. In the current study, we therefore attempted to identify the upstream kinase of ARK5 during IGF-1 signaling. Based on the result of a bioinformatic analysis using the active site of CaMKKs, we identified a protein kinase as a candidate and demonstrated that the kinase acts as the upstream kinase of ARK5 during IGF-1 signaling. Here we report NDR2 as a novel ARK5 kinase that acts in cells during IGF-1 stimulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Culture—Human colorectal cancer cell lines HCT-116, DLD-1, and SW480 were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). For transfection, cells were seeded into a 24-well plate at 5 × 104/well, and transfection was performed with TransFast transfection reagent (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The transfection yield was assessed with a green fluorescent protein expression vector, and the yields in the current study were 97.3% for HCT-116 cells, 98% for DLD-1 cells, and 98.6% for SW480 cells.Chemicals, Antibodies, Plasmids, and Recombinant Proteins—LY294002, BAPTA, genistein, U-73122, and bisindolylmaleimide-1 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem, and U0126 was purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Antibodies against HA, S100B, PDK-1, phospho-AMPK (Thr(P)-172), and phospho-PDK-1 docking motif were purchased from Sigma and Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). S100B protein and human recombinant IGF-1 were purchased from Sigma and Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Gunma, Japan). The expression vectors of ARK5 and DN-ARK5, which was prepared by conversion of the AKT phosphorylating serine residue (serine 600) to an alanine residue (1Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), were used in the experiments. The expression vectors of DN-AKT1 (K179M: ATP-unbinding mutant) were purchased from Upstate.Preparation of HA-tagged NDR2—HA-tagged NDR2 was prepared from full-length KIAA0965-ligated pBluescript II SK+ vector supplied by KAZUSA DNA Research Institute with LA PCR (Takara Biomedicals, Kyoto, Japan): upstream primer, 5′-GAGGCAGTTTCCGTTACTGAATTCATGTATCCTTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCTGCAATGACGGCAGGGACTACA ACAACCTTT-3′; downstream primer, 5′-ATGGGTGAATGTTATCTTCATCTCGAGTCATAACTTCCCAGCTTTCATGTA-3′. PCR product digested with EcoRI and XhoI was ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector.HA-NDR2/ΔPDM was prepared by the PCR method using mutagenesis primers (deletion mutant primer-1, 5′-CCCTTCAAACCTTTTAACCCAGTCTTTGGA-3′; deletion mutant primer-2, 5′-TCCAAAGACTGGGTTAAAAGGTTTGAAGGG-3′). PCR was performed using deletion mutant primer-1 and T7 promoter primer on pcDNA3.1(+) and deletion mutant primer-2 and pcDNA3.1/BGH reverse primer on pcDNA3.1(+). Each PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and extracted from the gel with the Wizard SV Gel PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Both PCR products were mixed, annealed, and amplified with T7 promoter and pcDNA3.1/BGH reverse primers, and the PCR products were digested by EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into pcDNA3.1(+). Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. Expression plasmids containing point-mutated NDR2 (T75A, T75D, S282A, S282D, T442A, and T442A) were constructed by PCR methods as described above with primers containing each of the mutation sites.Preparation of Recombinant NDR2—MBP-NDR2 (wild type and mutants) containing the tobacco etch virus protease site, was prepared by generating PCR product with KIAA0965 plasmid as template and then subcloning it with TOPO-TA cloning pCR2.1 vector. After sequencing, the plasmid was digested with XbaI and HindIII, ligated into pMal-c2X (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), and transformed into pBL21(DE3) GC-rich version Escherichia coli. MBP-ARK5/CD was purified with amylose resin, and the recombinant protein was eluted with maltose.RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA extraction from cell lines and tissue samples was performed with ISOGEN (Wako Pure Chemical Co., Ltd.) for RT-PCR. The extracted RNA (100 ng) was reverse transcribed to first strand cDNA with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Takara Biochemicals) and oligo(dT)16 primer, and then PCR was performed with LA PCR kit version 2.1 (Takara Biochemicals).siRNA Preparation—siRNA was prepared with HiScribe siRNA transcription kit purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Each PCR product (LKB1, 1851–2099 bp; CaMKK-2a, 4476–4695 bp; CaMKK-2b, 1564–1805 bp; NDR1, 2717–2895 bp; NDR2, 1620–1853 bp) was subcloned by ligation into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After sequencing, the vectors were digested with BamHI and XhoI and religated into 28i-pLITMUS vector. The siRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. The efficacy of the siRNA was assessed by the disappearance of the target factor in Western blotting and/or RT-PCR procedure. As a control for the siRNA, double-stranded RNA prepared by the in vitro transcription of empty 28i-pLITMUS vector was used as recommended in the instruction manual.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Antibody against HA was mixed with 1 mg of protein from each cell extract prepared by lysing cells with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing PBS for 30 min. After mixing, protein G-Sepharose was added and incubated for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing PBS and then heated in SDS sample buffer for Western blotting.Proteins were prepared for Western blotting analysis by lysing cells for 30 min with 1% Nonidet P-40 containing PBS. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and their protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Sample proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by a semidry blotting system. The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with PBS containing 5% (w/v) skim milk, washed with a mixture of PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma, Tween-PBS), and then incubated overnight at room temperature with antibody diluted with PBS. After washing with Tween-PBS, the membranes were incubated with 2000-fold diluted biotinylated horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The membranes were then washed with Tween-PBS and developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation of Threonine 211 Is Essential for ARK5 Activation during IGF-1 Signaling—We have reported direct ARK5 activation by AKT through phosphorylation of serine 600 in the regulatory domain during IGF-1 signaling in tumor cells (1Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of the serine residue is essential for ARK5 activation, the phosphorylation of a serine or threonine residue on the active T loop in the catalytic domain is also suspected of being necessary for ARK5 activation. Because phosphorylation of threonine 211 by LKB1 during metabolic stress has recently been reported (22Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), in the present study we investigated whether phosphorylation of threonine 211 is essential for ARK5 activation during IGF-1 signaling.Phosphorylation of threonine 172/174 on AMPK-α1/α2 has been reported to be essential for activation (16Hamilton S.R. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Hammet A. Stapleton D. Habinowsky S.A. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 25Salt I. Celler J.W. Hawley S.A. Prescott A. Woods A. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and multiple alignment of the catalytic domains of AMPK-α1, AMPK-α2, maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), SNF-1/AMPK-related kinase (SNARK), and ARK5 revealed that threonine 211 and the surrounding amino acid sequence of ARK5 is well conserved within AMPK catalytic subunit family members (Fig. 1A). To determine whether phosphorylation at threonine 211 is essential for activation of ARK5, we investigated the effect of alanine substitution of the threonine residue by a cell invasion assay because we previously found that ARK5 activation is crucial for IGF-1-induced tumor invasion of colorectal cancer cell lines (2Suzuki A. Lu J. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Esumi H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As previously reported, human colorectal cancer cell line SW480 intensely expressed ARK5 mRNA, and expression was weaker in cell lines HCT-116 and DLD-1 (Fig. 1B). Unfortunately we and others have not yet been able to produce antibody for phosphorylated ARK5 (ARK5/Thr(P)-211 and ARK5/Ser(P)-600). However, we recently reported that the phosphorylation status of ARK5 is detectable by Western blotting using commercial antibodies against threonine 172-phosphorylated AMPK-α (for Thr(P)-211) and AKT substrate antibody (for Ser(P)-600) (2Suzuki A. Lu J. Kusakai G. Kishimoto A. Ogura T. Esumi H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki A. Kusakai G. Shimojo Y. Chen J. Ogura T. Kobayashi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31557-31563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Fisher J.S. Ju J.-S. Oppelt P.J. Smith J.L. Suzuki A. Esumi H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: E986-E992Google Scholar). Using these antibodies, we investigated the phosphorylation status of ARK5 (wild type and T211A mutant) in cells before and after IGF-1 treatment. Although phosphorylation of both threonine 211 and serine 600 in wild-type FLAG-ARK5 was observed upon stimulation with IGF-1, only serine 600, but not threonine 211, of mutated FLAG-ARK5 in which threonine 211 was converted to an alanine residue was phosphorylated during IGF-1 signaling (Fig. 1C). Interestingly IGF-1 accelerated the invasion activity of HCT-116 and DLD-1 cells when wild-type ARK5 was transfected; however, the invasion was significantly less or even suppressed by T211A mutant expression as well as by S600A mutant expression (Fig. 1D). In addition, SW480 cells exhibited strong invasion activity upon stimulation by IGF-1, and it was also suppressed by T211A or S600A mutant expression (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the phosphorylation of threonine 211 is essential for ARK5 activation.Identification of NDR2 as a Novel Upstream Kinase of ARK5 during IGF-1 Signaling—In the present study, we found that threonine 211 must be phosphorylated during ARK5 activation upon stimulation with IGF-1. In addition, our current investigation showed that cell extracts from IGF-1-exposed HCT-116 cells phosphorylate threonine 211 of ARK5 as shown in Fig. 2A. Because only wild type, but not threonine 211 mutants (T211D and T211A), was phosphorylated by cell extracts of IGF-1-treated cells (Fig. 2A), we suggest that these cell extracts contain the upstream kinase of ARK5 that is activated during IGF-1 signaling. Two serine/threonine protein kinases, CaMKK-2 and LKB1, have been identified as upstream kinases phosphorylating a threonine residue on the active T loop in the catalytic domain of the AMPK catalytic subunit family (16Hamilton S.R. O'Donnell Jr., J.B. Hammet A. Stapleton D. Habinowsky S.A. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Hurley R.L.

A. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that both protein kinases exhibit a well conserved region in the catalytic domain (18Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether other unknown protein kinases carry a similar sequence using a BLAST search (versus protein sequences listed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information library) and identified NDR1 (also called STK38) and NDR2 (also called STK38L/KIAA0965) as candidates for the upstream kinase of ARK5. Interestingly NDR2 mRNA was strongly expressed in SW480 cells that exhibited ARK5-mediated tumor invasion (Fig. 2B). By contrast, mRNA expression of LKB1, CaMKK-2a, CaMKK-2b, and NDR1 was very weak in SW480 cells. To identify the kinase responsible for ARK5 activation induced by IGF-1, we constructed a series of siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 2C, each siRNA suppressed expression of each target factor. As shown in Fig. 2D, when HCT-116 cells were exposed to IGF-1, the cell extracts phosphorylated the recombinant protein of human ARK5 catalytic domain (rARK5/CD). Interestingly complete suppression of the IGF-1-induced rARK5/CD phosphorylation resulted when the siRNA for NDR2 was introduced into HCT-116 cells (Fig. 2D). Although a decrease in phosphorylation by about half occurred when siRNA for NDR1 was introduced, the siRNA for other factors did not suppress it at all (Fig. 2D). In addition, cell extracts from IGF-1-exposed HCT-116 cells phosphorylated the recombinant protein of human AMPK-α1 catalytic domain (rAMPK/CD), but none of the siRNA tested in this study suppressed it (Fig. 2D). By contrast, siRNA for LKB1 and CaMKK-2a completely and partially suppressed AMPK-α1 phosphorylation by glucose starvation, but the others did not suppress it at all (Fig. 2D). We recently reported that AMPK-α1 is phosphorylated in an LKB1-independent manner during IGF-1 signaling and that LKB1 plays an essential role in AMPK-α1 phosphorylation only in cells exposed to metabolic stress, e.g. glucose starvation (21Shaw R.J.

Thus, the results of the present study are consistent with our previous observations.FIGURE 2Phosphorylation of ARK5 by NDR2 upon stimulation with IGF-1. A, HCT-116 cells were exposed (+) or not exposed (–) to 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 2 h, and cell extracts were then mixed with recombinant protein coding the catalytic domain of ARK5 (wild-type, WT; T211D mutant, TD; T211A mutant, TA) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated (pARK5) or total (tARK5) recombinant proteins were detected by autoradiography or Western blotting with anti-MBP antibody after purification on an amylose resin column.

The amount of PHA synthesized from the degradation of 10-cis-heptadecenoic, tridecanoic, undecanoic, or nonanoic acids was equivalent or slightly reduced in the pte1Δ strain compared with wild type. In contrast, a strong reduction in PHA synthesized from heptanoic acid and 8-methyl-nonanoic acid was observed for the pte1Δ strain compared with wild type. The poor catabolism of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid via β-oxidation in pte1Δ negatively impacted the degradation of 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid and reduced the ability of the cells to efficiently grow in medium containing such fatty acids. An increase in the proportion of the short chain 3-hydroxyacid monomers was observed in PHA synthesized in pte1Δ cells grown on a variety of fatty acids, indicating a reduction in the metabolism of short chain acyl-CoAs in these cells. A purified histidine-tagged Pte1p showed high activity toward short and medium chain length acyl-CoAs, including butyryl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA and 8-methyl-nonanoyl-CoA. The kinetic parameters measured for the purified Pte1p fit well with the implication of this enzyme in the efficient metabolism of short straight and branched chain fatty acyl-CoAs by the β-oxidation cycle.

The kinetic parameters measured for the purified Pte1p fit well with the implication of this enzyme in the efficient metabolism of short straight and branched chain fatty acyl-CoAs by the β-oxidation cycle. Degradation of fatty acids is mediated by the β-oxidation cycle, which is located exclusively in the peroxisome in Saccharomyces cerevisae. Numerous enzymes involved in the degradation of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids have been identified and characterized. These include the three core enzymes of the β-oxidation cycle, namely the acyl-CoA oxidase Pox1p, the multifunctional enzyme Fox2p, harboring both an enoyl-CoA hydratase II activity and an (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, and the 3-ketothiolase Fox3p. Furthermore, the roles of the auxiliary enzymes enoyl-CoA isomerase Eci1p, dienoyl-CoA isomerase Dci1p, and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase Sps19p in the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids have also been defined (1Hiltunen J.K.

YJR019C (PTE1, TES1) has been identified in the S. cerevisiae genome as a gene encoding an acyl-CoA thioesterase (2Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

Acyl-CoA thioesterases are a group of enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to fatty acids and unesterified CoA (CoASH). 3The abbreviations used are: CoAHS, unesterified CoA; PHA, polyhydroxyalkanoate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MFE, multifunctional enzyme. 3The abbreviations used are: CoAHS, unesterified CoA; PHA, polyhydroxyalkanoate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MFE, multifunctional enzyme. Two types of acyl-CoA thioesterases have been found in Escherichia coli (4Spencer A.K. Greenspan A.D. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5922-5926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acyl-CoA thioesterase II (TesB) of E. coli is a tetramer with a molecular mass of 120 kDa and cleaves C6-C18 acyl-CoA esters as well as 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA esters (5Naggert J.

The S. cerevisiae Pte1p is a TesB-like acyl-CoA thioesterase and contains the Asp, Ser/Thr, and Gln catalytic triad expected for thioesterases. The protein contains a peroxisomal targeting signal type I at the carboxyl-terminal end and was shown to be located in the peroxisome (2Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

Amino acid sequences of acyl-CoA thioesterases belonging to the TesB family show good conservation among the animal, plant, fungi, and bacterial kingdoms (7Tilton G.B. Schockey J.M. Browse J. J.

The existence of various acyl-CoA thioesterases having activities toward either a narrow or broad range of substrates could provide important control points in the oxidation of many peroxisomal substrates as well as regulate intraperoxisomal levels of CoA esters and CoASH. Although it seems likely that the yeast Pte1p would be implicated in some aspect of fatty acid β-oxidation, its physiological function and enzymatic properties have not yet been clearly defined. Although one study has shown a reduction in the capacity of the pte1Δ mutant to grow in media containing oleic acid as the main carbon source, a separate study does not reveal any significant differences in phenotype between wild type and pte1Δ mutant (2Jones J.M.

In this work, we have studied the role of the Pte1p protein in peroxisomal β-oxidation by analyzing the kinetic activity of the purified protein in vitro, as well as by measuring the carbon flux through the β-oxidation cycle in vivo using the synthesis of peroxisomal polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) from the polymerization of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs as a marker. Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—The wild type S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 (matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) and the isogenic mutant pte1Δ (pte1Δ0::kan) were obtained from EUROSCARF. The plasmid Yiplac128-PHA containing the gene for the PHAC1 synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, modified at the carboxyl end by the addition of a peroxisomal targeting sequence and placed under the control of the catalase A (CTA1) promoter and terminator, has been previously described (8Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5254-5260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid Yiplac128-PHA was transformed into the wild type BY4742 as well as the isogenic pte1Δ by the lithium acetate procedure (9Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains harboring the PHA synthase gene were maintained in leucine-deficient medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and 0.69 g/liter of the appropriate amino acid drop-out supplement (Q-Biogen, Basel, Switzerland). For experiments analyzing PHA synthesis in cells growing on medium containing fatty acids, a stationary phase culture was harvested by centrifugation, the cells were washed once in water and resuspended at a 1:10 dilution in fresh medium containing 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 2% Pluronic-127 (w/v) (Sigma), and between 0.01 to 0.1% (w/v) of various fatty acids. The cells were grown for an additional 4 days before harvesting them for PHA analysis. The 10-cis-heptadecenoic, tridecanoic, undecanoic, nonanoic, and heptanoic fatty acids were purchased from Nu-Check-Prep (Elysian, MN), and 9-methyl-undecanoic acid and 10-methyl-undecanoic acid were purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals (Malmö, Sweden), whereas 8-methyl-nonanoic acid was purchased from Sigma. For experiments aimed at analyzing the growth of yeast in medium containing fatty acids, BY4742 and the isogenic pte1Δ were first grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose) until the exponential phase. The cells were then washed once in water before suspending them at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/ml in fresh medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with amino acids (Difco), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and either 0.05% 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid alone or in combination with either 0.01 or 0.02% 8-methyl-nonanoic acid. The cells were counted after 4 days of growth. Analysis of PHA—PHA was analyzed as previously described (8Poirier Y. Erard N. MacDonald-Comber Petétot J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5254-5260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with water, and lyophilized in a glass tube. The dried material was washed with warm methanol (65 °C) to remove free fatty acids, lipids, and acyl-CoAs, and the remaining material, including PHA, was trans-esterified at 94 °C for 4 h with 1 ml of methanol/chloroform mixture (1:1) containing 3% sulfuric acid. One ml of 0.9% NaCl was added to the cooled mixture, vortexed vigorously, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. The chloroform phase containing the methyl esters of 3-hydroxy-acids was then analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph (HP-5MS column) coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5972 mass spectrophotometer. Plasmid Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Acyl-CoA Thioesterase—The YJR019C open reading frame (EMBL/DDBJ/GenBank™ accession number NC_001142) was amplified from genomic DNA of the BY4742 strain using Pfu1 DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides to add 12- and 15-base single-stranded cohesive ends at the 5′ and 3′ ends of YJR019c, respectively. These cohesive ends were created by T4 DNA polymerase treatment of the PCR product in the presence of deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate, and the resulting fragment was cloned into the expression plasmid pET30 Xa/LIC (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting clone, designated pET30-YJR019c, created a Pte1 protein that was fused at the amino terminus to 6 histidine residues (Pte1p-His6). A control plasmid encoding only a histidine tag was also created, named pET30-His. pET30-YJR019c and pET30-His were first sequenced to ensure the absence of mutations and then introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). For polypeptide expression, cells were first cultivated at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.4, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added at a concentration of 0.5 mm, and cells were grown overnight at 25 °C. Polypeptides were extracted from cells immediately after the overnight cultivation with the B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce). The extract was loaded onto a column of His·bind resin (Novagen) equilibrated with 50 mm NiSO4. Polypeptides were purified with a standard protocol of His·bind buffer kit (Novagen) by gravity flow. Acyl-CoA Thioesterase Enzyme Assay—Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (7Tilton G.B. Schockey J.M. Browse J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7487-7494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of PTE1p-His6 was added to a 1-ml assay mixture composed of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), acyl-CoA, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) if necessary, and the change in A412 was measured for 1 min. The effect of CoASH on the enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 232 nm using octanoyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA were purchased from Sigma. Other acyl-CoAs were synthesized and purified from free acid and CoA hydrate trilithium salt according to the method of Kurosawa et al. (10Kurosawa T. Sato M. Inoue K. Yoshimura T. Tohma M. Jiang L.L. Hashimoto T. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1998; 365: 249-257Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The purity of acyl-CoAs, as evaluated by HPLC, was 88% for octanoyl-CoA, 89% for lauroyl-CoA, 93% for oleoyl-CoA, 91% for nonanoyl-CoA, 83% for decanoyl-CoA, and 90% for 8-methyl-nonanoyl-CoA. Kinetic curves were fitted to the Hill equation (11Herbert D. Price L.J. Alban C. Dehaye L. Job D. Cole D.J. Pallett K.E. Harwood J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), as follows: v = Vmax · [S]h/(Kmh + [S]h), where v is the velocity, Vmax is the maximum velocity, Km is the Michaelis constant, and h is the Hill coefficient. The Hill coefficient and the Michaelis constant were determined from data plot to the following: log(v/Vmax/(1 - v/Vmax)) = h · log[S] - h · logKm. Vmax was determined so that the coefficient of determination (R2) in the plot became closest to 1. Analytical Procedures—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Gel filtration chromatography was performed with an HPLC system equipped with a TSK gel G3000SW column (7.5 × 300 mm; Tosoh, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Protein samples were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, including 0.5 m NaCl at 1.0 ml min-1. Acyl-CoAs were analyzed at A260 with an HPLC system equipped with a TSK gel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm-diameter particle, Tosoh, Inc.). Elution was performed with an acetonitrile gradient of 10-90% (v/v) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.4, at 1.0 ml min-1. Analysis of Carbon Flux through β-Oxidation in pte1Δ Mutant—The quantity and monomer composition of PHA synthesized from intermediates of the β-oxidation cycle was first measured in the wild type and pte1Δ background for S. cerevisiae cells grown in medium containing either 0.1% 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid or 0.1% tridecanoic acid. The amount of PHA synthesized in the pte1Δ strain represented 57 and 62% of the amount produced in wild type for cells in medium with 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid and tridecanoic acid, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, a significant increase in the proportion of the H5:0 monomer (the 3-hydroxy acid monomers found in PHA are defined with the prefix H followed by the number of carbon and the number of unsaturated bonds; see Table 1) was evident in the pte1Δ strain. Thus, for PHA produced from 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid, the H5:0 monomer increased from 19 ± 1 mol % in wild type to 26.3 ± 0.8 mol % in pte1Δ, whereas for PHA produced from tridecanoic acid, the H5 monomer increased from 9 ± 1 mol % in wild type to 15.7 ± 0.7 mol % in pte1Δ (Student's t test, p < 0.0001). In contrast to the relatively modest decrease in PHA quantity produced in the mutant strain grown in the presence of 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid or tridecanoic acid, a drastic difference was observed for cells grown in medium containing 8-methyl-nonanoic acid. Wild type cells grown in medium containing 0.1% 8-methyl-nonanoic acid produced 10 × 10-4 g of PHA/g of cell dry weight, with the polymer containing only two monomers, namely 3-hydroxy,8-methyl-nonanoic acid (8M-H9:0) and 3-hydroxy,6-methyl-heptanoic acid (6M-H7:0). In contrast, pte1Δ cells grown in the same medium produced PHA near the detection limit at <0.02 × 10-4 g of PHA/g of cell dry weight (Fig. 1C). A large decrease in PHA synthesized from the β-oxidation of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid was also observed when the quantity of fatty acid in the medium was decreased to 0.01% (Fig. 1D). Thus, under these conditions, wild type produced 11 × 10-4 g of PHA/g of cell dry weight, whereas pte1Δ produced only 0.3 × 10-4 g of PHA/g of cell dry weight,. The proportion of the 6M-H7:0 monomer in cells grown on 0.01% 8-methyl-nonanoic acid increased from 30 ± 0.3 mol % in wild type to 41 ± 4 mol% in pte1Δ strain (Student's t test, p < 0.005).TABLE 1Names and abbreviations of PHA monomersMonomerAbbreviation3-Hydroxy,6-cis-tridecenoic acidH13:13-Hydroxy-tridecanoic acidH13:03-Hydroxy-undecanoic acidH11:03-Hydroxy-nonanoic acidH9:03-Hydroxy-heptanoic acidH7:03-Hydroxy-pentanoic acidH5:03-Hydroxy,10-methyl-undecanoic acid10M-H11:03-Hydroxy,8-methyl-nonanoic acid8M-H9:03-Hydroxy,6-methyl-heptanoic acid6M-H7:03-Hydroxy,9-methyl-undecanoic acid9M-H11:03-Hydroxy,7-methyl-nonanoic acid7M-H9:03-Hydroxy,5-methyl-heptanoic acid5M-H7:0 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the decrease in the catabolism of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid observed in the pte1Δ strain was related to either the presence of an isomethyl group or the length of the main carbon chain, the quantity and monomer composition of PHA was first compared for wild type and pte1Δ cells grown in tridecanoic, undecanoic, nonanoic, and heptanoic acids (Fig. 2). Because nonanoic and heptanoic acids were found to significantly inhibit growth at concentrations above 0.025%, the experiment was performed with the same concentration for all fatty acids, namely 0.025%. Although no significant differences were observed in the amount of PHA synthesized by wild type and pte1Δ strains grown on either tridecanoic or undecanoic acid, the amount of PHA synthesized in the pte1Δ cells grown in medium with nonanoic and heptanoic acids were 70 and 8.9% of the wild type level, respectively. For all fatty acids tested, there was a significant increase in the proportion of the H5 monomer in the pte1Δ strain compared with wild type. Thus, the H5 monomer was found to increase from 6.2 ± 0.2 to 9.1 ± 0.3, 6.3 ± 0.2 to 8.8 ± 0.3, 4.2 ± 0.6 to 7 ± 1, and from 80 ± 10 to >99 mol % for cells grown on tridecanoic, undecanoic, nonanoic, and heptanoic acids, respectively (Student's t test, p < 0.01). PHA was also analyzed for cells grown in medium containing 9-methyl-undecanoic acid and 10-methyl-undecanoic acid, both at a 0.025% (Fig. 3). Deletion of Pte1 resulted in a significant decrease in PHA synthesized from the β-oxidation of the branched chain fatty acid tested, with the PHA amount in pte1Δ being 34 and 59% of wild type level for cells grown on 9-methyl-undecanoic acid and 10-methyl-undecanoic acid, respectively. There was also a large increase in the proportion of the smallest monomer observed for PHA produced from either branched chain fatty acids in the pte1Δ mutant. Thus, for PHA synthesized from 9-methyl-undecanoic acid, the 5M-H7:0 monomer increased from 8.7 ± 0.5 mol % in wild type to 24.5 ± 0.4 mol % in pte1Δ (Student's t test, p < 0.00001). Similarly, for PHA synthesized from 10-methyl-undecanoic acid, the 6M-H7:0 monomer increased from 25.5 ± 0.5 mol % in wild type to 49.1 ± 0.5 mol % in pte1Δ (Student's t test, p < 0.0001). To examine whether the poor catabolism of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid through the β-oxidation observed in the pte1Δ strain could negatively influence the catabolism of other fatty acids in the same cells, wild type and pte1Δ cells were grown in medium containing either only 0.05% 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid, only 0.01% 8-methyl-nonanoic acid, or the combination of both 0.05% 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid and 0.01% 8-methyl-nonanoic acid (Fig. 4). For all treatments, the amount of PHA synthesized from the degradation of each external fatty acid was determined separately. Although PHA synthesized from the degradation of 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid in the pte1Δ strain reached 66% of the wild type level for cells grown in medium containing only 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid, PHA synthesized from the catabolism of the same fatty acid in pte1Δ decreased to 19% when 8-methyl-nonanoic acid was added to the medium. Conversely, although PHA synthesized from the degradation of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid in the pte1Δ strain reached only 3% of wild type level for cells grown in medium containing only the branched chain fatty acid, PHA synthesized from the catabolism of the same fatty acid in pte1Δ reached 15% when 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid was added to the medium. To assess whether the reduction in the catabolism of 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid observed in the pte1Δ strain by the addition of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid in the medium had an impact on the ability of the cells to grow using fatty acids as the external carbon source, wild type and pte1Δ cells that did not contain the peroxisomal PHA synthase were first grown to an exponential phase in medium containing glucose, 3.5 × 105 cells/ml were then inoculated to medium containing 0.05% 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid alone or in combination with 0.01 or 0.02% 8-methyl-nonanoic acid, and the cells were counted after 4 days (Fig. 5). Although pte1Δ cells reached a density equivalent to 75% of wild type in medium containing only 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid, this level decreased to 40 and 34% when 0.01 or 0.02% 8-methyl-nonanoic acid was added to the medium, respectively. Enzymatic Activity of Purified Pte1p—A recombinant protein fraction purified by nickel affinity chromatography was analyzed with SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography. A predominant protein migrating at 43.4 kDa was found by SDS-PAGE, whereas the molecular mass of PTE1p-His6 polypeptide was predicted to be 45.3 kDa (Fig. 6A). Therefore, this nickel affinity protein fraction was used for Pte1p kinetic analysis. In gel filtration chromatography, several peaks emerged on the chromatogram of the PTE1p-His6 fraction (Fig. 6B). From comparison of the retention time of peak 2 with those of molecular mass marker proteins, it was found that the peak 2 fraction contained a protein with the molecular mass of 45 kDa, which corresponded to the putative molecular mass of PTE1p-His6 (Fig. 6B). Thioesterase activity toward acetyl-, butyryl-, octanoyl-, lauroyl-, oleoyl-, and 8-methyl-nonanoyl-CoA could be detected only in the peak 2 fraction but not in the peak 1, -3, -4, and -5 fractions (Fig. 6B and data not shown). Although the nature of peaks 3-5 has not been analyzed, they could represent degradation products of PTE1p-His6 or other contaminants, such as imidazole. As a control, thioesterase activity in a nickel affinity protein fraction extracted and purified from a strain expressing only a His tag (pET30His) was tested. No thioesterase activity toward acetyl-, butyryl-, octanoyl-, lauroyl-, oleoyl-, or 8-methyl-nonanoyl-CoA was found in the fraction, indicating that intrinsic E. coli enzymes do not interfere with the Pte1p kinetic analysis using the nickel affinity protein fraction. Thioesterase activity with octanoyl-CoA was found to be maximal at pH 8 (Fig. 7A). Thus, all further assays were performed in a potassium phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. The requirement of BSA for Pte1p acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was investigated. BSA did not significantly affect the specific activity with acetyl-, butyryl-, octanoyl-, 8-methyl-nonanoyl-, and nonanoyl-CoA. However, the specific activity with decanoyl-, lauroyl-, or oleoyl-CoA was enhanced with increasing BSA concentrations and reached a plateau at a fatty acid to BSA molar ratio of 50, 4.7, and 2.2, respectively (data not shown). Thioesterase activity for acyl-CoA ranging from acetyl- to nonanoyl-CoA and 8-methyl-nonanoyl-CoA was thus measured without BSA, whereas activity for decanoyl-, lauroyl-, and oleoyl-CoA was measured at a fatty acid to BSA ratio of 50, 4.7, and 2.2, respectively (Fig. 8). The velocity curves described by the Hill equation (see “Experimental Procedures”) after substitution of the kinetic parameters fit well to the data plots (Fig. 8). Table 2 provides the calculated Km and Vmax values for the purified Pte1p. The highest specific activity was observed for butyryl-CoA, whereas the lowest specific activities were obtained with oleoyl-CoA. CoASH was found to inhibit thioesterase activity with an IC50 of ∼30 μm (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 8Thioesterase activity of PTE1p-His6 with various acyl-CoAs.

Numerous roles have been postulated for this enzyme in the metabolism of lipids, including the release of free fatty acids from acyl-CoA intermediates of the β-oxidation cycle followed by export of the fatty acids out of the peroxisome for either excretion into the urine or re-entry into the mitochondria for further β-oxidation, prevention of the accumulation of poorly metabolized CoA esters to promote efficient flux through β-oxidation, or catabolism of cholesterol via hydrolysis of bile acid-CoA (12Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 99-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, direct experimental evidence of the in vivo importance of the peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase in these proposed activities has been generally lacking. In S. cerevisiae, although one study shows that deletion of the Pte1 gene leads to a small but significant decrease in the ability of cells to grow on oleic acid as the main carbon source, no obvious effects have been observed in a separate study with a similar mutant (2Jones J.M.

Overexpression of the human peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase III (hTE/hACTEIII/PTE-1) in human and murine T-cell lines or in thymocytes of transgenic mouse results in an increase in peroxisome number (13Ishizuka M.

In the present study, the role of the S. cerevisae peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase Pte1p in the metabolism of fatty acids via the β-oxidation cycle was analyzed using the synthesis of PHA via the polymerization of the β-oxidation intermediate 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA as a marker for the state of carbon flux through this pathway. Previous studies using PHA synthesis in S. cerevisae peroxisomes have been used to reveal the existence of a futile cycle of intermediates of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway toward the β-oxidation cycle, to monitor the substrate specificity of mutants of the multifunctional enzyme Fox2p, as well as to study the involvement of auxiliary enzymes in the degradation of trans-unsaturated and conjugated fatty acids (14Marchesini S.

Acta. 2005; 1734: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PHA synthesized from the β-oxidation of fatty acids present in the medium was found to be slightly reduced (<2-fold) in S. cerevisae pte1Δ mutant compared with wild type when cells were grown in medium containing 0.1% 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid or 0.1% tridecanoic acid. For tridecanoic acid, the difference in PHA amount between wild type and pte1Δ was abolished when the concentration of the fatty acid in the medium was decreased to 0.025%. No differences in PHA amount were also observed for wild type and pte1Δ cells grown in medium containing 0.025% undecanoic acid, whereas only 1.4-fold less PHA was observed for pte1Δ compared with wild type for cells grown on 0.025% nonanoic acid. In contrast, 11-fold less PHA was observed for pte1Δ compared with wild type for cells grown in medium containing 0.025% heptanoic acid. These data indicate that, although the presence of the peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase is not essential to maintain a normal or near normal level of carbon flux through the β-oxidation cycle when the medium or long straight chain fatty acids are metabolized, the same enzyme is important for efficient degradation of short chain fatty acids. The effect of the absence of the peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase on the β-oxidation of fatty acids was found to be even more drastic for the metabolism of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid. Thus, PHA synthesis from the β-oxidation of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid was reduced by ∼30-500-fold in the pte1Δ mutant compared with wild type when the external 8-methyl-nonanoic acid concentrations were 0.01 and 0.1%, respectively. In contrast, the reduction in PHA synthesized in pte1Δ compared with wild type was <3-fold for 9-methyl-undecanoic acid and 1.5-fold for 10-methyl-undecanoic acid. These results indicate that short branched chain fatty acids are less well metabolized via β-oxidation than their straight chain counterpart in the pte1Δ mutant compared with wild type and that this difference is enhanced for shorter branched chain fatty acids such as 8-methyl-nonanoic acid. The very low amount of PHA synthesized from 8-methyl-nonanoic and heptanoic acids in the pte1Δ strain compared with wild type highlight the importance of the peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase for the efficient metabolism of these short straight chain or branched chain fatty acids via the β-oxidation cycle. It is possible that one or several of the enzymes of the core β-oxidation cycle poorly metabolize such fatty acids. Accumulation of poorly metabolized CoA-esters would result in a block of the β-oxidation cycle, because adequate concentration of free CoASH is essential for the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase step. Alternatively, it is possible that a CoA-ester derived from 8-methyl-nonanoic and heptanoic acids inhibits one of the enzymes of the β-oxidation cycle. Thus, whereas in the pte1Δ the inhibitory or poorly metabolized acyl-CoAs would accumulate and reduce the flux through the β-oxidation cycle, the presence of the acyl-CoA thioesterase in the wild type would decrease the level of such acyl-CoAs and allow β-oxidation to proceed (Fig. 9). A corollary of this hypothesis is that accumulation of the inhibitory or poorly metabolized acyl-CoA in the pte1Δ mutant grown in medium containing 8-methyl-nonanoic acid would not only block the metabolism of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid but also that of other fatty acid targeted for degradation via β-oxidation in the same cell. This was verified by showing that, although synthesis of PHA from 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid in wild type cells was not significantly affected by the addition of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid in the medium, a 3.5-fold reduction in PHA synthesized from the degradation of 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid in pte1Δ was observed when 8-methyl-nonanoic acid was added to the medium. The reduced catabolism of 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid in pte1Δ cells caused by the presence of 8-methyl-nonanoic acid also impacted the ability of cells to grow in medium containing fatty acids as the main carbon source. This was revealed by the reduction in cell density in pte1Δ cells when either 0.01 or 0.02% 8-methyl-nonanoic acid was added to medium containing 0.05% 10-cis-heptadecenoic acid. Even for fatty acids that are relatively well metabolized in both wild type and pte1Δ, the reduced catabolism of short chain fatty acyl-CoAs in pte1Δ is revealed by the increased proportion of the H5:0 monomer in PHA synthesized in the mutant from straight chain fatty acids, as well as the 6M-H7:0 and 5M-H7:0 monomer in PHA synthesized from the catabolism of 10-methyl-undecanoic acid and 9-methyl-undecanoic acid, respectively. A similar increase in the proportion of short chain PHA monomers (H5:0 or H6:0) has been observed in a previous study, where the wild type Fox2p encoding the multifunctional enzyme (MFE-2) was replaced by a mutant variant with an inactivation in the B domain of the dehydrogenase (14Marchesini S. Erard N. Glumoff T. Hiltunen J.K. Poirier Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6495-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This MFE-2(bΔ) mutant showed undetectable dehydrogenase activity toward (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, whereas kcat values toward (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA and (R)-3-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA was reduced by <2-fold (18Qin Y.-M. Marttila M.S. Haapalainen A.M. Siivari K.M. Glumoff T. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28619-28625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was reasoned that the reduced activity of the MFE-2(bΔ) toward short chain (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs made them more available to the PHA synthase compared with the other intermediates generated by the wild type MFE-2. Thus, it can be also reasoned that the increased proportion of the small straight or branched chain 3-hydroxyacids present in PHA derived from the pte1Δ strain reflects an increased concentration of the corresponding 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs in the mutant because of their reduced metabolism via the β-oxidation cycle in the absence of the peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase. This suggests that an inappropriate high level of certain acyl-CoAs in the pte1Δ would have a larger negative effect on the metabolism of short chain β-oxidation intermediates compared with longer ones. The kinetic parameters measured for the purified Pte1p fit well with the implication of this enzyme in the metabolism of short straight and branched chain fatty acyl-CoAs. The enzyme showed a relatively broad range of activity, with lowest activity toward oleoyl-CoA and highest activity toward the short chain butyryl-CoA and intermediate activities toward nonanoyl-, decanoyl-, and 8-methyl-nonanoyl-CoA. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme toward nonanoyl- and 8-methyl-nonanoyl-CoA were almost identical, indicating that the addition of an isomethyl group did not substantially modify enzymatic activity. The substrate preference observed for the purified Pte1p differed from the maximal activity toward lauroyl-CoA measured by Kal et al. (3Kal A.J. Hettema E.H. van den Berg M. Groot Koerkamp M. van Ijlst L. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a crude extract from cells overexpressing the Pte1 gene from a 2μ multicopy plasmid. Numerous differences exist in the assay conditions between these two studies, including parameters of the assay buffer, such as pH and the presence of detergent. The presence of inhibitors in a crude S. cerevisae extract may potentially result in a shift in the maximal activity of the acyl-CoA thioesterase toward longer acyl-CoAs. The activity of Pte1p was inhibited by CoASH. Such inhibition has also been reported for the human peroxisomal PTE-2 (6Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of inhibitory or poorly metabolized acyl-CoAs that would lead to a sequestration of CoASH into esters, such as 8-methyl-nonanoyl-CoA, the acyl-CoA thioesterase would be highly active and would work to decrease the concentration of the acyl-CoA and re-establish a pool of free CoASH required for maintaining a flux through the β-oxidation cycle. Short chain fatty acids and methyl-branched fatty acids are relatively common fatty acids found in nature. Caproic (6:0) and caprylic (8:0) acids are found in both animal and plant fats, such as the milk of cows and goats and the seeds of plants, such as coconut and oil palms. Although, to our knowledge, branched chain fatty acids have not been identified in S. cerevisae, fatty acids with a methyl group in the iso or anteiso position are abundantly found in the membrane lipids of a wide variety of bacteria, including bacteria found in the gut of ruminants, causing the appearance of such fatty acids in the milk and meat of these animals (19Kaneda T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 288-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Garton G.A. Chem. Ind. 1985; 9: 295-300Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement of the peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase for the efficient degradation of short straight chain and branched chain fatty acids could have implications as far the fitness of organisms, such as S. cerevisae, which must grow and survive in an environment containing such fatty acids.

In animal models, the expression of C/EBPα is transiently decreased in regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy, and hepatocytes from C/EBPα knock-out mice manifest increased proliferation in culture. In several cancer cell lines, enforced expression of C/EBPα by transfection causes significant growth inhibition or arrest (16Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L.

In other cell types the antiproliferative effects of C/EBPα result from C/EBPα binding to and inhibiting E2F; in hepatocytes, both inhibition of E2F and stabilization of p21 contribute to the growth arrest.

Recent studies indicate that the inhibition of cell proliferation by C/EBPα is contingent upon its phosphorylation status, which when altered may allow C/EBPα to stimulate cell growth. In hepatocytes, activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT led to the nuclear accumulation of protein phosphatase 2A, which dephosphorylated C/EBPα at Ser-193. The dephosphorylated C/EBPα interacted with and sequestered the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), decreasing E2F-Rb complexes with a consequent acceleration of cell growth (27Wang G.L. Iakova P. Wilde M.

Another potential regulatory point for the anti-proliferation properties of C/EBPα is suggested by the interaction of C/EBPα with the chromosome remodeling factor, SWI/SWF, which is necessary for C/EBPα-mediated growth arrest (29Muller C.

To determine whether C/EBPα exhibited unique functions in prostate cells, we screened prostate cancer cell lines for proteins that bound to C/EBPα and identified three DNA repair proteins, Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 as C/EBPα partner proteins. The interaction of C/EBPα with PARP-1, Ku80, and Ku70 interfered with the non-homologous ending joining (NHEJ) 2The abbreviations used are: NHEJ, non-homologous ending joining; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HSC protein, heat shock cognate protein; LSUHSC, Louisiana state University Health Sciences Center; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy; Gy, gray; N, none; H, high; L, low. DNA repair and contributed to increased sensitivity of prostate cells to radiation and DNA damage from bleomycin and iron. Reagents and Antibodies—Antibodies against C/EBPα (sc-61 and sc-9314) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against Ku80 (MS-285), Ku70 (MS-329), and PARP (RB-1680) were from Lab Vision Corp., Inc (Fremont, CA). RPMI 1640 medium was from Mediatech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). Bleomycin sulfate (Blenoxane) was from Nippon Kayaku Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Cell Culture and Cell Transduction by Retrovirus-expressing C/EBPα—The human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and Du145 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells with stable expression of C/EBPα were established with a pantropic retroviral expression system (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, the full-length rat C/EBPα cDNA was inserted into the retrovirus vector pLNCX and was co-transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) into GP2–293 packaging cells with pVSV-G, expressing an envelope glycoprotein of the vesticular stomatitis virus. After 48 h of transfection, medium was collected and filtered, and prostate cancer cell lines were transduced with a mixture of virus-containing medium and fresh medium at ratio of 1:2. Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium at 8 mg/ml for the first 24 h. Stable expressing clones were selected with Geneticin at 400 mg/ml (Mediatech Cellgro, Herndon, VA) for 2–3 weeks. Constructs and Protein Expression—Full-length rat and human C/EBPα cDNA and C-terminal fragments (C1 and C2) were kind gifts from Daniel G. Tenen and Atsushi Iwama, respectively. The N-terminal fragment of C/EBPα was made by removing the NotI fragment from the C terminus of C/EBPα. The full-length cDNAs and N or C terminus-deleted fragments were subcloned into pET30 vectors (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, Madison, WI) and pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of S tag, His tag, and GST fusion proteins. The full-length cDNAs of Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 were generated by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA of LNCaP or Du145 cells and cloned into pcDNA3 and pET vectors. All constructs were sequenced, and a few errors in the sequence were corrected by the replacement of fragments. The clones with error-free cDNA of Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 were transfected into BL21 codonPlus™-(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and expressed proteins were identified by Western analysis. GST-C/EBPα in Vitro Protein Binding Assay—GST-C/EBPα fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL cells and purified with the GST Purification Module (Amersham Biosciences). The pull-down assay was conducted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton-X100 by incubation of GST-C/EBPα with lysates of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL cells containing expressed Ku80, Ku70, PARP-1, and heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC) proteins from pET vectors carrying full-length cDNAs coding for these proteins. The pull-down proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected with the appropriate antibodies by Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted from cells stably expressing C/EBPα with NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitation was conducted with an antibody against C/EBPα. Briefly, 4 μg of anti-C/EBPα antibody and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to 0.5 ml of cell lysate (about 600 μg protein) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 after which the pellet was resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot analysis with antibodies against Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1. For immunoprecipitation with human prostate cancer tissue, frozen samples were obtained under a LSUHSC Institutional Review Board-approved protocol from the Feist-Weiller Cancer Center tissue repository at LSUHSC. The tissue protein was extracted with NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). RNA Isolation and Microarray Analysis—RNA was isolated from retrovirus-transduced cells with TRI reagent®-RNA/DNA/protein isolation reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression analysis with Affymetrix gene chip was conducted on the human U95A array (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) using 10 μg of total RNA. Synthesis of cRNA and subsequent hybridization was completed by the Research Core Facility at LSUHSC-S using the standard Affymetrix protocols. The human U95A array represents 12,256 oligonucleotides of known genes or expression tags. The raw data were collected and analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite with the scale set at 2500. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts from prostate cancer cell lines were obtained with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Cell proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond™ ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 1× TBST (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated at room temperature with rabbit anti C/EBPα antibody for 2 h, washed, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The signal was detected with SuperSignal Dura Substrate (Pierce). NHEJ Assay—The NHEJ assay was conducted according to previous work with slight modifications (34Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 35Chappell C. Hanakahi L.A. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. West S.C.

Briefly, the nuclear extract was prepared as above with NE-PER® nuclear extraction reagents and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 100 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Then 20–25 μg of nuclear protein was mixed with 400 ng of BamH1- and XhoI-digested pBlueKs plasmid DNA in 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 40 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm dNTPs, and 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The 50-μl reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h followed by protease K treatment and extraction with phenol/chloroform. One-half of each reaction was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and stained with Gelstar (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ). The stained gels were scanned, and the percentage of end rejoining was calculated by dividing the sum of dimer and multimer by sum of monomer, dimer, and multimer. S-tagged C/EBPα Protein Capture and MALDI-TOF-MS—S-tagged C/EBPα fusion proteins were expressed in pET-30A-C/EBPα in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL cells after induction with 0.8 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified with S-tagged agarose beads. The fusion proteins bound to agarose beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 400 μl (about 1 mg of protein) of cell lysates from Du145 and PC3 cells, obtained by extraction with NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents. The beads were pelleted and washed, and the “pull-down” proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with GelCode® Blue. The proteins bound to S-tagged C/EBPα fusion proteins were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS in the Research Core Facility of LSUHSC-Shreveport with the Voyager-DE™ PRO Biospectrometry™ Work station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, the proteins captured by the S-tag C/EBPα fusion protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with GelCode® Blue. The protein bands of interested were sliced from the gel and subjected to peptide extraction and elution with C18 zip-tips. The peptides were analyzed with three different instrument settings: Proteomics_autosample.bic, Insulin_liner.bic, and peptide negative_reflector.bic. The analyses of spectra data was performed with Data Explore Software (version 3.2.1) for algorithms to correct the base line and remove the noise at 2 S.D. The match of peptide data was conducted against protein databases, NCBI and Genpept, using Auto MS-Fit software. Radiation, Cell Proliferation, and Clonogenic Survival Assays—80 × 105 cells grown on 35-mm plastic dishes were suspended in 2 ml of RPMI1640 medium in a 15-ml plastic tube and exposed at room temperature to radiation at doses of 4 and 8 Gy from a Varian 6-MV linear accelerator. For proliferation assays after exposure to radiation, cells were grown in 96-well plates at initial densities of about 1000 cells/well for 0 and 4 Gy and 3000 cells/well for 8 Gy exposure in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml of Geneticin. The cell proliferation assay was conducted 6 days after radiation exposure with the CellTiter 96® AQueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For colony formation assays cells were exposed to radiation and plated at density of 500 cells per well in 6-well plates in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml Geneticin, and after 10 days the cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet, and colonies enumerated under a dissecting microscope. Screening for Proteins That Partner with C/EBPα in Prostate Cancer Cells—Putative protein partners of C/EBPα were identified by using a pull-down assay in which an S-tagged C/EBPα fusion protein was incubated with lysates containing both cytoplasm and nuclear proteins from the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and Du145 (Fig. 1). Analysis of the proteins that co-precipitated with C/EBPα by separation by SDS-PAGE identified four protein bands that appeared to be specifically pulled down by C/EBPα. These protein bands were neither seen with incubation of the S-tag protein alone with cell lysates from PC3 and Du145 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3) nor with the S-tag C/EBPα fusion protein without cell lysate (Fig. 1, lane 5). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of each protein band demonstrated that the proteins of approximate molecular masses 113, 82, and 70 kDa were PARP-1, Ku80, and HSC, respectively. Based on analysis with Auto MS-Fit, the MOWSE (MOlecular Weight SEarch) scores for all identified proteins were greater than 105. In addition, a band staining with a molecular mass of about 20 kDa was not successfully identified. The Further Identification of the Interaction of C/EBPα with Putative Partner Proteins—To confirm the physical interaction between C/EBPα and the proteins identified in the pull-down assay, we conducted an in vitro GST pull-down assay by incubating a GST-C/EBPα fusion protein with Ku80, HSC, and PARP-1 expressed in the E. coli BL21 system. Considering that Ku80 functions as a heterodimer with Ku70, we also examined the interaction between Ku70 and C/EBPα. Among the four proteins, Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 were pulled down by GST-C/EBPα fusion protein (Fig. 2A), whereas HSC did not show any interaction with C/EBPα in the GST pull-down assay (data not shown). Furthermore, by taking advantage of the ability to express PARP-1, Ku70, and Ku80 in E. coli, we could determine whether the addition of one of these proteins competed for the binding of the others to C/EBPα (Fig. 2B). The presence or absence of Ku70/80 had no effect on the binding of PARP-1 to C/EBPα (Fig. 2B, left panel). Likewise, in the absence of PARP-1 or in the presence of PARP-1 at two different concentrations, the binding of Ku70 or Ku80 to C/EBPα was not affected (Fig. 2B, right panel). Therefore, it is most likely that C/EBPα forms a complex with PARP-1, Ku70, and Ku80 proteins rather than forming dimers with each individual protein. In all experiments a greater percentage of PARP-1 appeared bound to C/EBPα than seen with Ku70 and Ku80. For example, by densitometric scanning of the Western blots of the pull-down proteins and the corresponding inputs in Fig. 2A, the ratio of bound protein over input was 2.4 for PARP-1, 0.63-fold for Ku70, and 0.28-fold for Ku 80. These data imply that PARP-1 binds more strongly to C/EBPα than the two Ku proteins, but it is not known if the differences in binding have any functional consequence. To determine whether the interactions between C/EBPα and Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 also occurred in vivo in intact cells, we first examined the expression levels of Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 in various prostate and non-prostate cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2C, Ku80 and Ku70 were expressed in all the cell lines examined. PARP-1 was expressed in all cell lines except U937 cells. These cell lines also expressed low levels of endogenous C/EBPα protein, although only the p42 isoform was detected (Fig. 2D, left panel). To determine whether the endogenous Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 proteins would interact with C/EBPα, several prostate cell lines were constructed that overexpressed C/EBPα. Clones of the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, Du145, and PC3 were generated through retrovirus transformation using the full-length rat C/EBPα cDNA inserted into the retrovirus vector PLNCX. The increased expression of C/EBPα was seen in all transduced cell lines. Although the p42 isoform was the predominant isoform, the p30 isoform was detected in transduced LNCaP cells (Fig. 2D, right panel). As shown in Fig. 2E, in all three lines Ku70, Ku80, and PARP-1 co-precipitated with C/EBPα. Among the three transduced cell lines PC3 showed the weakest interaction of C/EBPα with Ku proteins and PARP-1 based on the ratio of co-precipitated proteins to the input in the cell lysates. However, the interaction could be strengthened by the induction of double-strand DNA breaks by exposure of PC3 cells to bleomycin and iron. After incubation of the PC3 cells with bleomycin and iron for 24 h, expression of C/EBPα increased by 3.4-fold, and the amount of Ku70, Ku80, and PARP-1 that co-precipitated with C/EBPα increased as well by 6.6, 2.7, and 1.7-fold, respectively. Ku70, Ku80, and PARP-1 also co-precipitated with endogenous C/EBPα as was demonstrated in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2F, top panel) and in human prostate cancer tissue (Fig. 2F, middle and lower panels). The expression of C/EBPα and the two Ku proteins was detected in all three samples of prostate cancer. However, PARP-1 was only detected in two of the samples (Fig. 2F, middle panel), and in a third sample, PARP-1 was detected as only small fragments, presumably resulting from proteolysis, of less than 50 kDa apparent molecular mass (data not shown). In the cancer tissue the interaction of C/EBPα with Ku70, Ku80, and PARP-1 was seen by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2F, bottom panel). These in vitro and in vivo binding assays demonstrate that Ku70, Ku80, and PARP-1 proteins may universally interact with C/EBPα. In the lung cancer cell line H358, Ku70 and Ku80 also coprecipitated with C/EBPα when C/EBPα was overexpressed (data not shown). These results also suggest that formation of a C/EBPα-Ku70–80-PARP-1 complex could depend on the specific cell type and perhaps the status of the cell. The C Terminus of C/EBPα Is Essential for the Binding of Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1—C/EBPα has three transactivation domains located in the N terminus of the protein and a basic leucine zipper domain in the C terminus. Both the N and C termini have been shown to have different roles in regulation of gene transcription, cell differentiation, and proliferation. To determine which domain is necessary for the binding of Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1, we expressed several different polypeptides of C/EBPα (Fig. 3). These peptides included an N-terminal fragment with two of the transactivation domains intact (Fig. 3A, N), a truncated C/EBPα p30, which can be physiologically translated from an internal AUG codon in some cells (Fig. 3A, C1), and a C-terminal fragment containing the basic leucine zipper domain alone (Fig. 3A, C2). All three fragments were expressed as S-tagged proteins and purified with S-protein-agarose. The C/EBPα fragments (Fig. 3B, lower panel) were incubated with whole cell extracts from LNCaP cells, bound proteins were pulled-down, and the presence of Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 was examined by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 interacted with C/EBPα via the C-terminal region (Fig. 3B, upper panel, C1 and C2). No interactions could be demonstrated with the N-terminal region of C/EBPα (Fig. 3B, upper panel, N). Stable Expression of C/EBPα Increases the Sensitivity of Du145 and PC3 Cells to Radiation—It has been well known that Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 take part in the repair processes of DNA double-strand breaks. To determine whether the interaction of C/EBPα with Ku80, Ku70, and PARP-1 affected DNA repair function in prostate cancer cells overexpressing C/EBPα, we first examined expression of genes participating in DNA repair. Without inflicting any DNA damage onto LNCaP, Du145, or PC3 cells, the mRNA levels of Ku70, Ku80, and PARP-1 were not affected by expression of C/EBPα (data not shown). The expression of genes responsible for both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining was examined by microarray analysis of clones of PC3 and LNCaP cell lines expressing C/EBPα (Table 1). No significant changes were observed except for a greater than a 2-fold log ratio change of Rad50 mRNA levels in both C/EBPα-expressing lines. Next, the protein levels of Ku70, Ku80, and PARP-1 and C/EBPα were examined by Western"
https://openalex.org/W2075886608,"Drosophila tolloid (TLD) is a member of a family of proteinases that play important roles in development and includes mammalian tolloid (mTLD) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-1. TLD accentuates the activity of decapentaplegic (DPP), a transforming growth factor β superfamily growth factor, by cleaving its antagonist Short gastrulation (Sog). Similarly, the activity of BMP-2/4 (vertebrate homologues of DPP) is augmented by cleavage of chordin. However, whereas TLD is an effective Sogase, mTLD is a poor chordinase and is functionally replaced by its smaller splice variant BMP-1, which lacks the most C-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and CUB domains of mTLD. Moreover, the minimal chordinase activity resides in the N-terminal half of BMP-1. This study showed that the proteolytic activity of TLD is considerably enhanced by Ca2+ and tested the hypothesis that the Sogase activity of TLD resides in the N-terminal half of the proteinase. Unexpectedly, it was found that TLD lacking the CUB4 and CUB5 domains and/or the EGF-like domains was unable to cleave Sog. Loss of function mutations have been reported in the tld gene that result in amino acid substitutions at E835K (in CUB4), S915L (in CUB5), and N760I (in EGF2) in TLD. The CUB mutants were found to be ineffective Sogases, but the activity of the EGF2 mutant was unchanged. The results show that substrate recognition and cleavage by Drosophila tolloid and mTLD are different despite their identical domain structure and homologous functions in patterning. The result that the N760I mutant has full Sogase activity suggests that novel substrates for TLD exist."
