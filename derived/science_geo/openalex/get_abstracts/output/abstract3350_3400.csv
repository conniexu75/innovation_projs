https://openalex.org/W1964265039,"Treatment of Ltk−, mouse L cells deficient in thymidine kinase (tk), with Bam I restriction endonuclease cleaved DNA from herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) produced tk+ clones with a frequency of 10−6/2 μg of HSV-1 DNA. Untreated cells or cells treated with Eco RI restriction endonuclease fragments produced no tk+ clones under the same conditions. The thymidine kinase activities of four independently derived clones were characterized by biochemical and serological techniques. By these criteria, the tk activities were found to be identical to HSV-1 tk and different from host wildtype tk. The tk+ phenotype was stable over several hundred cell generations, although the rate of reversion to the tk− phenotype, as judged by cloning efficiency in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine, was high (1–5 × 10−3). HSV-1 DNA Bam restriction fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis, and virtually all activity, as assayed by transfection, was found to reside in a 3.4 kb fragment. Transformation efficiency with the isolated fragment is 20 fold higher per gene equivalent than with the unfractionated total Bam digest. These results prove the usefulness of transfection assays as a means for the bioassay and isolation of restriction fragments carrying specific genetic information. Cells expressing HSV-1 tk may also provide a useful model system for the detailed analysis of eucaryotic and viral gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2040246407,"The lateral habenula is one of the few forebrain areas that project to the midbrain raphe nuclei. Electrical stimulation of the habenula markedly suppressed serotonergic neurons in the midbrain raphe. The suppression was blocked by systemic or microiontophoretic administration of picrotoxin, which suggests that gamma-aminobutyric acid is the inhibitory transmitter in the habenula-raphe pathway. These results support the concept that the habenula may serve a pivotal role in funneling information from the forebrain to the midbrain raphe."
https://openalex.org/W1527438907,"An endogenous substrate for adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase has been solubilized, and purified about 5,000-fold to apparent homogeneity, from a particulate fraction of bovine cerebral cortex enriched in synaptic membranes. This endogenous substrate, referred to as Protein I, is apparently specific to nervous tissue, and is composed of two types of polypeptides, present in a proportion of 1 (Protein Ia, 86,000 daltons) to 2 (Protein Ib, 80,000 daltons). In the presence of cAMP-dependent Protein I kinase purified from the same membrane fractions, Proteins Ia and Ib incorporated 0.83 and 0.81 mol of phosphate into serine/mol of peptide, respectively. Proteins Ia and Ib have similar amino acid compositions and have isoelectric points of 10.3 and 10.2, respectively. Both types of polypeptide have a relatively high content of glycine and proline, and both are degraded to a peptide of 48,000 daltons by highly purified collagenase, suggesting that Proteins Ia and Ib contain some sequences similar to those observed in collagen. The sedimentation coefficient of Protein Ia and Protein Ib was determined to be 2.9 S. The data suggest that both Protein Ia and Protein Ib have an elongated shape."

https://openalex.org/W1980634026,"Mouse L cells lacking the enzyme thymidine kinase (LMTK−) have been converted to a TK+ phenotype by infection with fragmented HSV2 strain 333 DNA. The DNA fragments used were either unique, produced by cleavage with the restriction endonucleases Eco RI and Hind III, or randomly produced by mechanical shearing. Survival in HAT medium was used initially to establish the TK+ phenotype; clones possessing the ability to grow in selective medium were picked on the basis of differing morphology and growth rates. Cytosol extracts of these clones possessed virusspecified TK activity identical to that present in cells lytically infected with HSV2, as indicated by thermolability and mobility on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The transformed cells also exhibit HSV-specific immunofluorescence. Based on these transformation studies, it is possible to assign a map location to the TK gene on the HSV genome."
https://openalex.org/W1491167803,"The synthesis of glycosaminoglycans by human skin fibroblasts derived from normal subjects, Hurler and Marfan patients before and after transformation by SV40 virus has been studied. Virus transformation results in a marked increase in hyaluronic acid synthesis in normal and Hurler fibroblasts and, to a lesser extent, in Marfan fibroblasts which show augmented synthesis of this polysaccharide before transformation. There is also an increase in heparan sulfate synthesis but a moderate decrease in dermatan sulfate synthesis on transformation. Incubation of transformed fibroblasts with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside results in a marked increase in synthesis of free chondroitin sulfate chains. The synthesis of hyaluronic acid, but not of dermatan sulfate, is inversely proportional to cell density in normal fibroblasts but not in transformed fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2052464658,"Synaptic responses in hippocampal granule cells to stimulation of their afferent fibers from the entorhinal cortex fluctuate with a 24-hour period. The phase of this cycle for rats and monkeys depends on whether the animal is naturally nocturnal or diurnal. In a rat blinded by enucleation, the rhythm persists but drifts out of phase with the rhythm of sighted controls."

The increase was inhibited by actinomycin D (0.1 μg/ml) and 1 μM cycloheximide, suggesting that de novo transcription and enzyme synthesis are responsible for the increased enzyme activity. This result is evidence for a regulatory mechanism for angiotensin converting enzyme, which is important in blood pressure control."

https://openalex.org/W1996407941,"We have examined the arrangement of the nucleosomes in relation to DNA base sequence in nucleoprotein complexes from polyoma and SV40. Digestion of polyoma nucleoprotein complex with Hpa II restriction endonuclease showed that each of the nine cleavage sites for this enzyme in the DNA was equally available in the nucleoprotein complex. We conclude that the nucleosomes do not occupy unique positions. The alternatives are that the arrangement of the nucleosomes is completely random, or that each nucleosome can, within the whole population of nucleoprotein complexes, occupy one of a limited number of positions. To investigate this, we have isolated the 140 base pair protected DNA fragments from a micrococcal nuclease digestion of nucleoprotein complex. We have used these fragments to indicate the positions, in relation to the DNA base sequence, of the nucleosomes from which they are derived. The restriction endonucleases Bam I and Eco RI each cut polyoma and SV40 DNA at one site. Digestion of the 140 base pair DNA with these enzymes yielded a reproducible series of about 10 smaller fragments. We conclude that the nucleosomes occupy a small number of distinct alternative positions; the arrangement is not completely random. This interpretation is consistent with a number of other findings, which together suggest that the nucleoprotein complex contains a repeating element of structure extending across both nucleosomes and bridge regions. We have also found that there are preferred cleavage sites in DNA for micrococcal nuclease. Although this is of some interest, we do not believe that it provides the explanation for the generation of the discrete fragments from monomer DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1492910694,"The conditions and utility of the N-chlorosuccinimide/urea (NCS/urea) reagent for the selective cleavage of tryptophanyl peptide bonds in proteins is demonstrated with cytochrome c. At low concentrations of NCS/urea the oxidation of thioether side chains in cytochrome c is the predominant reaction. Methionyl residues are oxidized to sulfoxide and the heme-thioether bridge is partially cleaved. At 10-fold excess of NCS/urea reagent, cleavage of the tryptophanyl peptide bond is optimal at approximately 50% yield in several species of cytochrome c studied. Analytical data on isolated horse cytochrome c peptide fragments demonstrate lack of modification and cleavage at tyrosyl and histidyl residues. However, at high concentrations of NCS/urea reagent (30-fold) unexpected conversions of methionine to sulfone and cysteine to cysteic acid in intact proteins are observed. This is in contradistinction to the absence of sulfone in NCS/urea-reacted amino acid mixtures. The mechanisms of halogenation and cleavage by N-bromosuccinimide, N-iodosuccinimide, and N-chlorosuccinimide are discussed. It is porposed that the selectivity with respect to halogenation by N-chlorosuccinimide is due to the insignificant participation of molecular chlorine in the NCS/urea reaction. A mechanism of halogenation and cleavage by NCS at tryptophan is also offered."
https://openalex.org/W177479641,"Brain cytoplasmic cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) requires an endogenous Ca2+-binding protein for ful activity. We now show that lysophosphatidylcholine also effectively enhances activator-deficient phosphodiesterase activity. Stimulation by both ligands was immediate and reversible; both rendered the enzyme more thermally labile, decreased the energy of activation, and increased the Vmax of phosphodiesterase without affecting its apparent Km for adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate. However, the cofactor requirements of the two ligands were different. Although the protein activator gave a greater stimulation than lysophosphatidylcholine, the simultaneous presence of the two gave a stimulation comparable to lysophosphatidylcholine, suggesting that the effect of the latter was predominant. Phosphodiesterase was also stimulated by oleic acid, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylinositol, albeit to a less extent."
https://openalex.org/W2074499621,"CHRONIC latent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are associated with tissues of the nervous system in experimentally infected mice and rabbits1,2 as well as in humans3–5. Cook and Stevens demonstrated, that, after inoclation into the skin, HSV migrates via the subserving nerves to the corresponding sensory ganglia6. The virus establishes there a latent infection which can be detected by methods of in vitro cultivation of the ganglia1–5. A consideration of the data obtained so far on the behaviour of latent HSV in mice, rabbits and men led Cook and Stevens as well as Baringer to the postulate, that latent HSV infections were restricted to tissues of the nervous system7,8. The failures to detect HSV in the skin during latent infections are consistent with this hypothesis9,10. Recurrent HSV infections are thought to arise by activation of the latent infection within the ganglia and the subsequent migration of the reactivated virus into the skin via the corresponding nerve fibres8,11. I have described recently experimental infections of guinea pigs with HSV type 2, which led to chronic latent infections of the animals with frequent spontaneously recurring lesions at the sites of initial inoculation12,13. In this report I present evidence that during the latent phase of the infection HSV can be recovered not only from nervous tissues but also from the skin at the site of the primary infection."
https://openalex.org/W2003596816,"The feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) is a target for naturally occurring immunity that protects the cat against development of fibrosarcoma and leukemia. Feline sarcoma virus-transformed ""nonproducer"" mink cells express high levels of FOCMA, but not of the major viral structural proteins. Transformation of the same cells by murine sarcoma virus, or infection with feline leukemia virus, which is nontransforming for epithelial or fibroblastic cells, did not induce FOCMA. Thus, FOCMA expression in mink lung cells is specifically associated with transformation by feline sarcoma virus."

https://openalex.org/W2002180891,Two apparently distinct species of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase appear during the first 1-2 hr of development in Dictyostelium discoideum; no such activity can be detected in vegetative cell extracts. These two kinases are similar in properties to the type I and II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases found in a number of mammalian tissues. Their time of appearance supports the idea that one or both mediate the effects of cyclic AMP on gene expression early in Dictyostelium development.

https://openalex.org/W2115242850,"Wild-type S49 lymphoma cells respond to cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP) by inducing cAMP phosphodiesterase, halting growth in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and subsequently dying. By using a counter selection procedure, we have isolated a new class of mutants of S49 cells termed “deathless” that are resistant to cytolysis, but otherwise respond like the wild-type cells to cAMP. Upon removal of the cyclic nucleotide, D− cells resume their normal growth. Unlike all other cAMP-resistant mutants of S49 cells isolated until now, the D− mutant has a functionally normal cAMP-dependent protein kinase and retains normal ability to induce phosphodiesterase and arrest cell growth in G1. It is probable that the altered gene product of the D− mutant is distal to protein kinase and in a biochemical pathway separate from that of cAMP induction of phosphodiesterase or growth arrest. The D− mutant may facilitate studies of the mechanism of cAMP-induced cytolysis and growth regulation in S49 cells."

https://openalex.org/W2053684265,"In situ hybridization has been used to study polyoma DNA replication in a clonal derivative of the inducible LPT line of polyoma-transformed cells designated as clone 1A. This study has shown that in clone 1A cultures maintained under normal growth conditions, 4–25 in 10,000 cells are spontaneously induced to synthesize polyoma DNA at an enhanced rate. In cultures exposed to mitomycin C (MMC), the percentage of induced cells remains approximately equal to the spontaneous level for 9 hr, and then increases for at least 24 hr up to 30–57% as more and more cells are asynchronously recruited to replicate the virus DNA. DNA reassociation kinetics and in situ hybridization have been used to determine the amount and distribution of polyoma DNA accumulated within clone 1A cells. These measurements have shown that a single induced cell in an MMCtreated culture produces 24,500 genome-equivalents of the virus DNA; second, that the average yield of virus DNA in a normally growing culture is only 41.7 genome-equivalents per cell; however, a single spontaneously induced cell in this culture produces as much virus DNA as an MMC-induced cell; third, that all the virus DNA molecules are found within the nuclei and many are clustered in aggregates containing up to 2000 genome-equivalents. We discuss the implications of these findings regarding the regulation of polyoma DNA replication in the LPT line."

https://openalex.org/W2073639425,"Mouse-human heterokaryons are permissive for the replication of both SV40 virus and polyoma virus. If the hybrids which develop from these heterokaryons segregate human chromosomes (mouse greater than human hybrids), the hybrids are permissive for replication of polyoma virus but not for replication of SV40 virus. If the subsequent hybrids segregate mouse chromosomes (human greater than mouse hybrids), such hybrids support the replication of SV40 virus but not the replication of polyoma virus, even when the hybrids contain at least one copy of each mouse chromosome. This indicates that during the transition from heterokaryon to hybrid cell, suppression of expression of species-specific function(s) required for the replication of these species-specific viruses occurs in parallel with the direction of chromosome loss and suppression of nucleolus organizer activity."
https://openalex.org/W1602396439,"The structure of a substituted, reiterated defective variant of the simian virus 40 genome has been analyzed. The DNA of the defective variant is a closed circular duplex resistant to restriction endonuclease R-EcoRI and slightly shorter than the genome of wild type simian virus 40. Analysis of the double-stranded DNA segments produced by the action of a variety of restriction endonucleases on the defective genome allow description of the molecule as follows. (a) The full DNA molecule contains four tandem repeats of a DNA segment containing both SV40 and monkey DNA sequences. (b) Three out of the four segments are identical and are about 23% of the wild type genome in length: one segment of the four is larger and contains an additional peice of DNA about 4.3% of a wild type genome in length, but is otherwise identical with the other three segments. (c) Portions of the defective variant that contain monkey DNA can be isolated as discrete segments by restriction endonuclease digestion. (d) Some of the sequences originating from monkey DNA are derived from the highly reiterated class of monkey DNA sequences; others may represent sequences derived from infrequently reiterated or single copy monkey sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1487311417,"Abstract A procedure for radiolabeling the terminal phosphoryl group of the tubulin nonexchangeable GTP site using bacterial acetate kinase and acetyl-32P is described. Warming such samples to 37 degrees results in microtubule assembly and hydrolysis of the nonexchangeable site GTP in a parallel fashion. Removal of the microtubule-associated protein fraction from lebeled tubulin prevents hydrolysis and assembly, and recombination of these components restores both processes again in a parallel fashion. These and other experiments indicate that the nonexchangeable site GTP hydrolysis and assembly are intimately linked. The experiments also demonstrate that GRP is not required at the exchangeable nucleotide site for assembly to occur."
