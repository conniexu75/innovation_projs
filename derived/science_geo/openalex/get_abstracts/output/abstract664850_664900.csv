Al-Ashouri et al. stabilized a perovskite with a 1.68–electron volt bandgap with a self-assembled monolayer that acted as an efficient hole-selective contact that minimizes nonradiative carrier recombination. In air without encapsulation, a tandem silicon cell retained 95% of its initial power conversion efficiency of 29% after 300 hours of operation. Science , this issue p. 1300"

However, modulation of gut microbiota in cancer patients has not been investigated in clinical trials. In this study, we performed a phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and feasibility of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and reinduction of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in 10 patients with anti-PD-1-refractory metastatic melanoma. We observed clinical responses in three patients, including two partial responses and one complete response. Notably, treatment with FMT was associated with favorable changes in immune cell infiltrates and gene expression profiles in both the gut lamina propria and the tumor microenvironment. These early findings have implications for modulating the gut microbiota in cancer treatment."

These materials fracture at high voltage, which increases surface area and leads to more side reactions and shorter cycle life. Using single-crystalline samples as model materials, Bi et al. observed changes in nickel-rich cathodes to study the fracture behavior under well-characterized conditions. As the material is charged and lithium is removed, specific planes glide over one another and microcracks are observed. However, this process is reversed on discharge, removing all traces of the microcracking. The authors developed a diffusion-induced stress model to understand the origin of the planar gliding and propose ways to stabilize these nickel-rich cathodes in working batteries.

https://openalex.org/W3112898749,"Obesity is a major cancer risk factor, but how differences in systemic metabolism change the tumor microenvironment (TME) and impact anti-tumor immunity is not understood. Here, we demonstrate that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity impairs CD8+ T cell function in the murine TME, accelerating tumor growth. We generate a single-cell resolution atlas of cellular metabolism in the TME, detailing how it changes with diet-induced obesity. We find that tumor and CD8+ T cells display distinct metabolic adaptations to obesity. Tumor cells increase fat uptake with HFD, whereas tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells do not. These differential adaptations lead to altered fatty acid partitioning in HFD tumors, impairing CD8+ T cell infiltration and function. Blocking metabolic reprogramming by tumor cells in obese mice improves anti-tumor immunity. Analysis of human cancers reveals similar transcriptional changes in CD8+ T cell markers, suggesting interventions that exploit metabolism to improve cancer immunotherapy."

Wang et al. explored the temporal dynamics of CFE on vegetation photosynthesis at the global scale. There has been a decline over recent decades in the contribution of CFE to vegetation photosynthesis, perhaps owing to the limiting effects of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This declining trend has not been adequately accounted for in carbon cycle models. CFE thus has limitations for long-term mitigation of climate change, and future warming might currently be underestimated. Science , this issue p. 1295"
https://openalex.org/W3111462718,"Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) using ex vivo-expanded autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can mediate complete regression of certain human cancers. The impact of TIL phenotypes on clinical success of TIL-ACT is currently unclear. Using high-dimensional analysis of human ACT products, we identified a memory-progenitor CD39-negative stem-like phenotype (CD39-CD69-) associated with complete cancer regression and TIL persistence and a terminally differentiated CD39-positive state (CD39+CD69+) associated with poor TIL persistence. Most antitumor neoantigen-reactive TILs were found in the differentiated CD39+ state. However, ACT responders retained a pool of CD39- stem-like neoantigen-specific TILs that was lacking in ACT nonresponders. Tumor-reactive stem-like TILs were capable of self-renewal, expansion, persistence, and superior antitumor response in vivo. These data suggest that TIL subsets mediating ACT response are distinct from TIL subsets enriched for antitumor reactivity."

The data revealed two superspreading events. One, in a skilled nursing facility, led to rapid transmission and significant mortality in this vulnerable population but little broader spread, whereas other introductions into the facility had little effect. The second, at an international business conference, produced sustained community transmission and was exported, resulting in extensive regional, national, and international spread. The two events also differed substantially in the genetic variation they generated, suggesting varying transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our results show how genomic epidemiology can help to understand the link between individual clusters and wider community spread."

Jawerth et al. used laser tweezer–based active and microbead-based passive rheology to characterize the time-dependent material properties of protein condensates (see the Perspective by Zhang). They found that condensate aging is not gelation of the condensates, but rather a changing viscoelastic Maxwell liquid with a viscosity that strongly increases with age, whereas the elastic modulus stays the same.

Harvey et al. examined the evolutionary history and species diversity of suboscine birds in the tropics (see the Perspective by Morlon). Contrary to expectations that the tropics have higher rates of speciation, the authors observed that higher and more constant speciation rates occur in harsh environments relative to the tropics. Thus, for this group of birds, diversification in temperate to Arctic regions followed by the movement and retention of species in the tropics results in their higher local levels of species diversity.

https://openalex.org/W3112590295,"Maintaining muscle Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid that mediates inflammatory responses, also supports the function of muscle stem cells. Palla et al. found that loss of PGE2 in aging mice contributes to loss of muscle and appears to be a consequence of increased activity of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), an enzyme that degrades PGE2 (see the Perspective by Becker and Rudolph). Restoring PGE2 concentrations by inhibiting 15-PGDH in older mice improved muscle function. Decreased activity of 15-PGDH in older animals had beneficial effects that included decreased proteolysis and transforming growth factor–β signaling and increased mitochondrial function and autophagy. The findings reveal a potential therapeutic strategy to help maintain muscle mass and function during aging. Science , this issue p. eabc8059 ; see also p. 462"

Bone-marrow (BM) fibrosis is characterized by continuous replacement of blood-forming cells in the BM by excessive scar tissue. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is the prototypic example of progressive development of BM fibrosis. The hallmark feature of overt PMF is the excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), which is accompanied by a progressive loss of hematopoiesis and splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis. Although the molecular alterations in hematopoietic cells, which drive the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) have been largely defined (Vainchenker et al., 2011Vainchenker W.

The BM morphology in patients with PMF suggests that there is a stepwise evolution from an initial pre-fibrotic phase to a fibrotic phase with marked reticulin/collagen fibrosis. However, the initial changes and sequential events underlying the pre-fibrotic phase of the disease are not well characterized (Barbui et al., 2018Barbui T. Thiele J. Gisslinger H. Kvasnicka H.M. Vannucchi A.M. Guglielmelli P. Orazi A. Tefferi A.

The plethora of stromal cells in a normal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche (Baryawno et al., 2019Baryawno N. Przybylski D. Kowalczyk M.S. Kfoury Y. Severe N. Gustafsson K. Kokkaliaris K.D.

Witkowski M. et al.The bone marrow microenvironment at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2019; 569: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) suggests that different stromal subtypes have distinct roles not only in normal hematopoiesis but also in BM fibrosis. In solid organ fibrosis, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are thought to be a major cellular source for fibrosis-driving cells (El Agha et al., 2017El Agha E. Kramann R. Schneider R.K. Li X. Seeger W. Humphreys B.D. Bellusci S. Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Fibrotic Disease.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 21: 166-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These findings are mainly derived from genetic fate tracing experiments, which allow us to study the cell fate in response to a pathological stimulus. The well-accepted hypothesis in solid organ fibrosis is that fibrosis-inducing insults, e.g., pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines, affect MSCs and lead to a fate switch toward myofibroblasts, which, in turn, drive fibrosis by depositing ECM. In the BM, we and others demonstrated that MSCs contribute to fibrosis-driving Gli1+ myofibroblasts (Decker et al., 2017Decker M. Martinez-Morentin L. Wang G. Lee Y. Liu Q. Leslie J. Ding L. Leptin-receptor-expressing bone marrow stromal cells are myofibroblasts in primary myelofibrosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; Schneider et al., 2017Schneider R.K. Mullally A. Dugourd A. Peisker F. Hoogenboezem R. Van Strien P.M.H. Bindels E.M. Heckl D.

Here, we explored the cellular composition of the murine and human BM stroma by specifically profiling purified non-hematopoietic BM cells by scRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify fibrosis-driving cells and underlying mechanisms in MPNs using an unbiased approach. To dissect the cellular composition and transcriptional changes of the murine BM stroma in the progression of BM fibrosis, we profiled non-hematopoietic BM cells by scRNA-seq in ThPO-induced BM fibrosis (Schneider et al., 2017Schneider R.K. Mullally A. Dugourd A. Peisker F. Hoogenboezem R. Van Strien P.M.H. Bindels E.M. Heckl D. Büsche G. Fleck D. et al.Gli1+ Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Are a Key Driver of Bone Marrow Fibrosis and an Important Cellular Therapeutic Target.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20: 785-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We analyzed (1) initial changes (pre-fibrotic stage) and (2) progression of BM fibrosis (fibrotic stage). Mice in the “pre-fibrotic” stage showed features of myeloproliferation and dysmorphic megakaryocytes but no reticulin fibers (reticulin grade 0, Figure 1A). In the fibrotic stage, mice developed severe BM fibrosis (Figure 1A). The hemoglobin (Hb) levels significantly decreased in ThPO-overexpressing mice as a surrogate marker for progression of BM fibrosis (Figure 1B). Mice exhibited significant thrombocytosis, when transplanted with ThPO-overexpressing HSPCs (Figure 1B), recapitulating the peripheral myeloproliferative phenotype observed in patients. We purified stromal cells from murine BMs at the pre-fibrotic time point and also the late, fibrotic time point (Table S1). Unsupervised clustering of only non-hematopoietic niche cells identified eight distinct subclusters, which were grouped into four major cell populations (Figure 1C). The most dominant cluster was characterized by high expression of Leptin receptor (Lepr), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (Pdgfra), and vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam1) as well as high levels of hematopoiesis supporting factors like Cxcl12, Kit ligand (Kitl), and angiopoietin (Angpt1), and was thus classified as MSCs (Figure 1D). The other clusters were identified as osteolineage cells (OLCs; Bglap, Sp7, Alpl), arterial cells/adventitial fibroblasts (ACs; Cd34, Ly6a, Ly6c1), and Schwann cell progenitors (SCPs; Mog, Mal, Plp1; Figures 1C and 1D). Within the Lepr+ fraction, four subpopulations of MSCs were identified, in line with recent reports (Baryawno et al., 2019Baryawno N. Przybylski D. Kowalczyk M.S. Kfoury Y. Severe N. Gustafsson K. Kokkaliaris K.D. Mercier F. Tabaka M. Hofree M. et al.A Cellular Taxonomy of the Bone Marrow Stroma in Homeostasis and Leukemia.Cell. 2019; 177: 1915-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar; Tikhonova et al., 2019Tikhonova A.N. Dolgalev I. Hu H. Sivaraj K.K. Hoxha E. Cuesta-Domínguez Á. Pinho S. Akhmetzyanova I. Gao J. Witkowski M. et al.The bone marrow microenvironment at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2019; 569: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The dominant cluster exhibited an adipogenic signature with high levels of Matrix Gla protein (Mgp) and Adiponectin (Adipoq, Figure S1B) as well as a strong expression of hematopoiesis supporting genes (e.g., Cxcl12, Kitl; referred to as MSC-1; adipogenic MSCs; Figures 1C and 1E). The second MSC subcluster was characterized by an osteogenic expression pattern (Spp1, Wif1, Ibsp, Sp7, Bglap; MSC-2; osteogenic MSCs; Figures 1C and 1E). In the third cluster (MSC-3), high transcript levels of genes involved in chromatin remodeling and RNA processing indicated that these cells are in a transition state between different functional states of MSCs (Wu et al., 2017Wu H. Gordon J.A.R. Whitfield T.W. Tai P.W.L. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Chromatin dynamics regulate mesenchymal stem cell lineage specification and differentiation to osteogenesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. Gene Regul. Mech. 2017; 1860: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; Figure S1D). Gene set enrichment analysis of cluster 4 (MSC-4) revealed that these cells are strongly primed by a response to type 1 and type 2 interferons (Figure 1E; Figure S1D). Comparison of the identified MSC marker genes between the different subpopulations and their respective aggregate gene expression analysis confirmed four distinct MSC populations (Figure 1F; Figure S1E). We further identified two distinct populations characterized by a Schwann cell precursor (SCP) signature (Figure 1G) indicated by Cdh19 expression (SCPs; Figure S1C): non-myelinating SCPs (nmSCPs) and myelinating SCPs (mSCPs; Figure 1G). All identified cell clusters were present in fibrosis and control, but significant changes in cellular compositions of particular clusters were detected (Figure 2A). In fibrosis, MSC-1 and OLCs significantly increased in their frequency, while MSC-3 and -4 significantly decreased (Figure 2A, right panel). Interestingly, mSCPs depicted the most drastic cell expansion in fibrosis. SCPs are cells with high regenerative potential and their contribution to HSC maintenance was recently demonstrated (Yamazaki et al., 2011Yamazaki S. Ema H. Karlsson G. Yamaguchi T. Miyoshi H. Shioda S. Taketo M.M. Karlsson S. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Nonmyelinating Schwann cells maintain hematopoietic stem cell hibernation in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2011; 147: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Potentially, mSCPs expand in response to the myeloproliferative stimulus in MPNs as a regenerative mechanism. ECM production is considered the key feature of fibrosis (Friedman et al., 2013Friedman S.L. Sheppard D. Duffield J.S. Violette S. Therapy for fibrotic diseases: nearing the starting line.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5: 167sr1Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). We therefore asked which cells show the most significant expression of ECM specific genes in order to identify cells that drive BM fibrosis, so called myofibroblasts. We dissected the expression of gene sets defined for matrisome-associated genes among the different clusters (Naba et al., 2016Naba A. Clauser K.R. Ding H. Whittaker C.A. Carr S.A. Hynes R.O. The extracellular matrix: Tools and insights for the “omics” era.Matrix Biol. 2016; 49: 10-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In particular, MSCs, OLCs, and ACs showed the highest expression of ECM in fibrosis (Figure 2B) (Naba et al., 2016Naba A. Clauser K.R. Ding H. Whittaker C.A. Carr S.A. Hynes R.O. The extracellular matrix: Tools and insights for the “omics” era.Matrix Biol. 2016; 49: 10-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Importantly, only MSC-1 and MSC-2 showed a significant upregulation of ECM proteins in BM fibrosis, indicating that these two populations are the cellular drivers of the fibrotic progression and acquire myofibroblast characteristics. The most significantly de-regulated genes in MSCs were grouped into (1) downregulated genes and (2) upregulated genes with onset of the MPN phenotype (Figures 2C; Figure S2A). The downregulated genes comprised (1) MSC markers (Vcam, Lepr, Adipoq) and (2) hematopoiesis support (Kitl, Il7, Igf1, Cxcl12, Csf1, Bmp4). The upregulated genes were defined through four major biological processes: (1) secreted factors (S100a8, S100a9, Pdgfa), (2) osteogenesis (Mgp, Fndc1), (3) neoangiogenesis (Vegfa, C3), and (4) ECM synthesis (Col8a1, Col1a1). As MSC-1 and -2 by gene expression seemed to be the most primitive MSCs and fibrosis-driving cells, we wondered whether they can be discriminated by surface markers from MSC-3 and -4. We isolated MSC-1 and -2 (Pdgfra/b+, Vcam1+, CD63+, Lamp1+) and MSC-3 and -4 (Pdgfra/b+, Vcam1+, CD63–, and Lamp1–) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for subsequent functional testing (Figures S2B and S2C). MSC-1 and -2 formed significantly more colony-forming units fibroblast (CFU-F) and had a higher cell-division rate, as compared to MSC-3 and MSC-4, highlighting their progenitor status (Figures S2D and S2E). Importantly, they were also more sensitive to pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor (TGF)-β stimulation in vitro as indicated by higher upregulation of Col1a1 and Acta2 mRNA as compared to MSC-3 and -4 (Figure S2F). In the context of differentiation into fibrosis-driving ɑ-SMA and Col1a1 expressing cells, MSC-1 and -2 strikingly downregulated Cxcl12, supporting our finding that these cells lose their hematopoiesis support during myofibroblast differentiation. Quantification of the frequency of MSC-1 and -2 in ThPO-induced BM fibrosis further supported the finding that these progenitor subsets are expanded in fibrosis while MSC-3 and -4 were decreased in their frequency (Figure S2G), in line with the data on the single-cell level (cf. Figure 2A). Surprisingly, SCPs and mSCPs, which most drastically expanded in fibrosis, only revealed minor transcriptomic changes in ThPO versus EV conditions. However, mSCPs were characterized by high and specific expression of Interleukin-33 (Il-33) and Prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds), implied to play central roles in solid organ fibrosis (Ito et al., 2012Ito H. Yan X. Nagata N. Aritake K. Katsumata Y. Matsuhashi T. Nakamura M. Hirai H. Urade Y. Asano K. et al.PGD2-CRTH2 pathway promotes tubulointerstitial fibrosis.J. Am. Soc.

Immunol. 2018; 9: 2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Figure S2H). Previously, we demonstrated that Gli1+ cells are fibrosis-driving cells in the BM. To reliably label Gli1+ cellular subsets of the BM niche, we used Gli1CreER;tdTomato reporter mice (Schneider et al., 2017Schneider R.K. Mullally A. Dugourd A. Peisker F. Hoogenboezem R. Van Strien P.M.H. Bindels E.M. Heckl D. Büsche G. Fleck D. et al.Gli1+ Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Are a Key Driver of Bone Marrow Fibrosis and an Important Cellular Therapeutic Target.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20: 785-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) for FACS-based purification for scRNA-seq. We integrated the data with stromal cells derived from the negative selection approach (Figure 2D; cf. Figure 1C; Table S1). Interestingly, Gli1+ cells are mostly MSCs, comparable to LepR+ cells but particularly annotated as MSC-1 (41%) and -2 (19%), the fibrosis-driving cells, explaining our previous finding that genetic ablation of these cells ameliorates BM fibrosis (Schneider et al., 2017Schneider R.K. Mullally A. Dugourd A. Peisker F. Hoogenboezem R. Van Strien P.M.H. Bindels E.M. Heckl D. Büsche G. Fleck D. et al.Gli1+ Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Are a Key Driver of Bone Marrow Fibrosis and an Important Cellular Therapeutic Target.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20: 785-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Gli1+ cells are also represented in the mSCP cluster (26%), in line with MSC being derived from neural crest and comparable to the Nestin+ population, which also contains SCPs (Isern et al., 2014Isern J. García-García A. Martín A.M. Arranz L. Martín-Pérez D. Torroja C. Sánchez-Cabo F. Méndez-Ferrer S. The neural crest is a source of mesenchymal stem cells with specialized hematopoietic stem cell niche function.eLife. 2014; 3: e03696Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Next, we asked which cellular composition and transcriptional changes are characteristic for niche cells in the stepwise evolution of BM fibrosis (Figures 3A and 3B ). Fibrosis-inducing MSC-1, both SCP populations and OLCs expanded in the pre-fibrotic phase while all other MSC populations decreased. In manifest fibrosis, IL33-expressing mSCPs, OLCs, and ACs expanded (cf. Figure 1A). To understand overall transcriptional changes across the different populations in pre-fibrosis and fibrosis, we performed differential expression analysis. All MSC clusters (MSC-1 to -4) showed mostly downregulated genes in pre-fibrosis compared to control (Figure 3C; Figure S3A) while none of the other niche cell types showed transcriptional changes, neither in pre-fibrosis nor in fibrosis (Figures S3B and S3C). In pre-fibrosis, fibrosis-driving MSC-1 revealed ER stress and a significant downregulation of genes compared to the control condition (Figure 3C). The downregulated genes in MSC-1 and -2 indicated significant “transcriptional reprogramming” of these populations with loss of their core cellular characteristics: (1) loss of niche and hematopoiesis support as well as neurotrophic (e.g., Fzd1, Cebpb) and vascular signaling (e.g., Foxc2, Hes1), (2) loss of MSC multipotent progenitor status (e.g., Arntl, Arhgdib, Ddr1, Lamb1), (3) decreased cellular function (e.g., Mapk3, Msn), and (4) metabolic inactivation (e.g., Cat, Tblxr1, Dgat1, Pank2). In manifest fibrosis, MSC-1 and -2 upregulated numerous genes, which confirmed the functional reprogramming with loss of niche-supportive characteristics and loss of multipotent progenitor status (Figure 3D). MSC-1 was characterized by marker genes for myofibroblasts (e.g., upregulation of Igfbp7, Limch-1, Wisp-2) and extensive ECM and collagen synthesis (mainly Col1a1, Col8a1). Changes in MSC-2 indicated that these cells differentiate into (1) myofibroblasts (e.g., upregulation of Limch1, Gas7, Acta1), (2) osteoblasts (e.g., upregulation of Bglap), and (3) also glial cells (e.g., upregulation of S100a8, S100a9), potentially also compensating for the neuropathy and Schwann cell death in MPNs. To validate our hypothesis that MSCs are reprogrammed in early stages of fibrosis and are fibrosis-driving myofibroblasts, which do not support normal hematopoiesis in manifest fibrosis, we defined gene sets based on the literature (Table S4) to interrogate “hematopoiesis support,” “MSC progenitor phenotype,” “non-collagenous ECM,” and “collagenous ECM” and plotted the dynamics of these gene sets in pre-fibrosis and fibrosis (Figure 3E). In pre-fibrosis, MSCs are characterized by downregulated hematopoiesis support (MSC-3 and -4) and MSC characteristics (MSC-1, -2, -3). Even at this early time point, genes defining non-collagenous ECM proteins were significantly upregulated mainly in MSC-1 and -2, the fibrosis-driving cells. In overt fibrosis, MSCs showed highly significant downregulation of hematopoiesis support, MSC characteristics, and strong upregulation of ECM proteins (in all MSC clusters) and collagen (in MSC-1 and -2). By comparing the differential expression signature of our single cell data with 14 signatures of pathway perturbation in pre-fibrosis and fibrosis (pathway responsive genes [PROGENy] analysis; Schubert et al., 2018Schubert M. Klinger B. Klünemann M. Sieber A. Uhlitz F. Sauer S. Garnett M.J. Blüthgen N. Saez-Rodriguez J. Perturbation-response genes reveal signaling footprints in cancer gene expression.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we detected increased activity of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic pathways, specifically tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and also of the JAK-STAT pathway, in fibrosis-driving MSC-1 and -2 (Figure 3F). Interestingly in pre-fibrosis, pro-fibrotic TGF-β signaling was significantly decreased in MSC-1 and -2, while in fibrosis it showed the most extreme upregulation (Figure 3F). The TGF-β pathway, considered to be the master regulator of fibrosis (Meng et al., 2016Meng X.-M. Nikolic-Paterson D.J. Lan H.Y. TGF-β: the master regulator of fibrosis.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2016; 12: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar), thus seems to play a central role in BM fibrosis but is not one of the earliest events, which are rather inflammation driven. We validated our findings by using retroviral expression of the JAK2V617F mutation, which is the most common mutation in patients (Mullally et al., 2012Mullally A. Lane S.W. Brumme K. Ebert B.L.

After 24 weeks, mice developed severe fibrosis (Figure 4A), low hemoglobin levels, and high platelets (Figure 4B; Figure S4A). Single cell RNA-seq recovered 1,292 cells non-hematopoietic cells, with an average of 1,000 genes per cell (Table S1). Exactly the same eight populations identified in the ThPO-induced BM fibrosis model were detected (Figure 4C; Figure 4D cf. Figure 1D; Figures S3B–S3D): (1–4) MSCs (MSC-1: adipogenic, MSC-2: osteogenic, MSC-3: transition, MSC-4: interferon high, (5 and 6) Schwann cell precursors (SCPs; 1: non-myelinating SCPs, nmSCPs; 2: myelinating SCPs, mSCPs), (7) osteoblastic lineage cells (OLCs), and (8) arterial fibroblasts (ACs). Cells from all identified populations were present in both the JAK2V617F-induced fibrosis and in non-fibrotic control mice. The integration of all cells indicated an expansion of MSC-1, MSC-4 (interferon-primed), and mSCPs in fibrosis compared to control (Figure 4E). The expansion of mSCPs was comparable to ThPO-induced BM fibrosis, again highlighting the role of glial cells in MPNs. MSC-1 and -2 and OLCs expressed the highest number of differentially expressed genes compared to the control condition (Figure 4F). MSC-1 and -2 were characterized by a strong osteogenic signature (ossification) in line with the advanced fibrosis grade (MF3). In MSC-1 and -2 the strong upregulation of Bglap (bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein, also known as Osteocalcin) indicated an osteogenic differentiation bias. In MSC-2, Spp1 (Secreted Phosphoprotein 1; also known as Osteopontin) was significantly upregulated. MSC-2 showed a strong inflammation/wound healing signature. MSC-1 and -2 further acquired a “myofibroblast” phenotype (upregulation of Limch1; Dcn) and expression of Col1a1, Col8a1, Fndc1 (Table S3). Our data show that MSC-1 and -2 in JAK2V617F-induced BM fibrosis acquire an osteogenic and myofibroblast phenotype with loss of MSC progenitor characteristics. SCPs and ACs only showed few changes in their transcriptome in JAK2V617F-induced PMF (Figure S4E). Exactly as observed in the ThPO-model of BM fibrosis, the expanded mSCP population was characterized by expression of the fibrosis-relevant genes Il33 and Ptgds (Figure S4F). MSC-1 and MSC-2 showed the highest upregulation of ECM proteins, in particular, “core matrisome,” collagen, and glycoproteins in myelofibrosis, confirming that these two MSC populations are the cellular drivers of fibrosis and acquire myofibroblast characteristics (Figure 4G). The significantly upregulated pathways in MSC-1 and -2 were TGF-β, TNF-α, and also JAK-STAT signaling, exactly as seen in the ThPO model, highlighting the importance of these pathways in BM fibrosis (Figure 4H). We aimed to dissect how cellular interactions within the niche affect the perturbation of signaling pathways detected in fibrosis by employing CellphoneDB (Efremova et al., 2020Efremova M. Vento-Tormo M. Teichmann S.A. Vento-Tormo R. CellPhoneDB: inferring cell-cell communication from combined expression of multi-subunit ligand-receptor complexes.Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15: 1484-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar; Türei et al., 2016Türei D. Korcsmáros T. Saez-Rodriguez J. OmniPath: guidelines and gateway for literature-curated signaling pathway resources.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 966-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Most ligand-receptor interactions were markedly decreased in ThPO-induced pre-fibrosis (Figure 5A; Table S5). In fibrosis (ThPO-induced), an overall decrease of cellular interactions was detected, while interactions between OLCs and SCPs increased. Interactions involving fibrosis-driving MSC-1 and MSC-2 showed distinct upregulation, indicating their activation as fibrosis-driving cells (Figure 5A). In the JAK2V617F dataset, a strong upregulation of intercellular communication between all niche populations was observed (Figure 5A). These findings support the hypothesis of a progressive reprogramming of the niche in fibrosis: niche populations first lose their physiological interactions and are then remodeled into a self-supporting network in advancing fibrosis. We quantified the absolute number of interactions for each unique ligand and ranked them by their absolute frequency (Figure 5B). ECM proteins (Col1a1, Fn1) and integrins involved in cell-ECM-interactions (Itgb1, Itga1, Itgav) were among the top hits. Tgfb1, Egfr, and Nfkb1 were also among the top 10 most abundant ligands. We next focused on interactions involving fibrosis-driving MSC-1 and -2 and Tgfb1 as a master switch in fibrosis (Figure 5C, first and second panel). Interestingly, MSCs themselves were predicted to be a main source of Tgfb1-driven cellular communication and showed upregulation of auto- and paracrine Tgfb1 signaling in manifest fibrosis. Tgfb1-mediated signals between OLCs and MSC-1/2 decreased over time, whereas those originating from SCPs increased. This is particularly interesting as Schwann cells have been described to participate in BM TGFβ G signaling (Yamazaki et al., 2011Yamazaki S. Ema H. Karlsson G. Yamaguchi T. Miyoshi H. Shioda S. Taketo M.M. Karlsson S. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Nonmyelinating Schwann cells maintain hematopoietic stem cell hibernation in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2011; 147: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In JAK2V617F-induced myelofibrosis an upregulation of Tgfb1 signaling in the niche was also observed. Our findings suggest that niche intrinsic TGFβ signaling contributes to the overall reprogramming of MSC-1 and MSC-2 in fibrosis. To understand the differentiation capacities of MSCs in fibrosis, we performed cell-fate trajectory analysis and identified a transcriptional continuum of the 4 MSC populations. SCPs and OLCs represented two distinct differentiated cell populations (terminal branch) starting at MSCs (Figure 5D). The trajectory implied a transition from MSC-1 and MSC-2 through MSC-3, as a transitory state, to one of the two terminal branches (Figure S5A). MSC-2, as osteogenic primed MSCs, showed the highest tendency toward osteoblastic differentiation (Figure 5D) and OLCs increased in fibrosis (Figure 5E). Interestingly, in the ontogeny of the BM HSC niche, some MSCs expressing Nestin share a common origin with sympathetic peripheral neurons and also glial cells. This might explain why some MSCs retain the plasticity to differentiate into glial cells/SCPs and Gli1+ cells can also be found in the SCP cluster ((Cai et al., 2017Cai S. Tsui Y.P.

Accordingly, in visual cortex, responses to a stimulus are modulated by context, the visual scene surrounding the stimulus. Responses are suppressed when stimulus and surround are similar but not when they differ. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we use optical recordings, manipulations, and computational modeling to show that disinhibitory circuits consisting of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing inhibitory neurons modulate responses in mouse visual cortex depending on similarity between stimulus and surround, primarily by modulating recurrent excitation. When stimulus and surround are similar, VIP neurons are inactive, and activity of SOM neurons leads to suppression of excitatory neurons. However, when stimulus and surround differ, VIP neurons are active, inhibiting SOM neurons, which leads to relief of excitatory neurons from suppression. We have identified a canonical cortical disinhibitory circuit that contributes to contextual modulation and may regulate perceptual saliency."

Despite prior predictions of devil extinction, transmission rates have declined precipitously from ~3.5 secondary infections per infected individual to ~1 at present.

The bacteriophage RNA polymerases, especially T7, have proven to be reliable work horses that continue to offer new insights into transcription as well as generate large quantities of RNA for research. The further optimization by affordable and high-throughput methods might be justified by the growing demand for pure and maximal transcript synthesis by modern molecular biology, structural biology applications, and even future mRNA therapeutics (21Gholamalipour Y.

For in vitro T7 transcription reactions, the T7 RNAP is purified and combined with a DNA template that contains its cognate promoter and a downstream sequence encoding the RNA to be synthesized. A common consensus promoter is TAATACGACTCACTATA followed by one to three guanine nucleotides before the desired sequence for synthesis (19Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Oligoribonucleotide synthesis using T7 RNA polymerase and synthetic DNA templates.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). In this study, we inserted the sequence encoding the Broccoli RNA aptamer (26Filonov G.S. Moon J.D. Svensen N. Jaffrey S.R.

RNA mimics of green fluorescent protein.Science. 2011; 333: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) to allow monitoring of RNA synthesis in real time by fluorescence detection. Upon proper folding and binding to the small molecule DFHBI-1T (3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxy-benzylidene imidazolinone), the short 49-nt Broccoli RNA aptamer fluoresces green with similar excitation and emission peaks as green fluorescent protein. This approach is similar to that taken by Hofer and colleagues previously, who fused the Spinach aptamer separated by a self-cleaving ribozyme to transcripts of interest (28Hofer K. Langejurgen L.V. Jaschke A. Universal aptamer-based real-time monitoring of enzymatic RNA synthesis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135: 13692-13694Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, our focus was on low-cost synthetic DNA templates, high reproducibility, and robust fluorescence readout to characterize reaction conditions, polymerase properties, or promoter sequence. This led us to utilize only the short Broccoli RNA aptamer sequence itself in a hybrid template that is single stranded but possesses a double-stranded promoter (19Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Oligoribonucleotide synthesis using T7 RNA polymerase and synthetic DNA templates.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). The Broccoli RNA aptamer has a very low dependence on magnesium and an increased thermostability compared with similar aptamers like Spinach (26Filonov G.S. Moon J.D. Svensen N. Jaffrey S.R.

The Broccoli RNA forms a G-quadruplex that relies on potassium or sodium ions to help stabilize structure and DFHBI-1T binding (29Ageely E.A. Kartje Z.J. Rohilla K.J. Barkau C.L. Gagnon K.T.

As a result of the RNA folded structure, the brightness and stability of Broccoli RNA fluorescence is also partially dependent on temperature, as will be the case for all folded aptamers (26Filonov G.S. Moon J.D. Svensen N. Jaffrey S.R. Broccoli: rapid selection of an RNA mimic of green fluorescent protein by fluorescence-based selection and directed evolution.J. Am. Chem.

Using 96-well plate screening, we confirmed the core buffer components necessary for efficient in vitro T7 transcription and explored the effect of several typical additives on transcriptional output. Fluorescence readout was correlated with denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of selected samples, transcription of two additional longer RNAs, and comparison across several common buffer conditions. We also performed saturation mutagenesis of the T7 RNAP promoter with this method and found that our results generally coincided well with previous mutagenesis studies. The results of this study provide a resource to researchers interested in the properties of T7 RNAP or that use T7 RNAP for routine synthesis of RNA in the laboratory. The Broccoli RNA aptamer did possess some shortcomings and may have introduced some sequence-dependent biases in template transcription. However, other aptamers with distinct fluorescent properties and folding are now available that may address some of Broccoli’s weaknesses, including Mango, Pepper, and o-Coral (30Autour A.

The ability of this method to recapitulate and confirm many of the commonly known properties of in vitro T7 RNAP transcription suggests that this approach should translate well to a variety of other bacteriophage RNA polymerases. It should also serve as an initial platform for developing screens for more complex eukaryotic in vitro transcription systems. To enable cost-effective, rapid, and direct readout of transcription, we selected the Broccoli RNA aptamer for its compact size, relative thermal stability, low magnesium dependence, and bright green fluorescence. Our design is similar to that reported previously by Jäschke and co-workers (28Hofer K. Langejurgen L.V. Jaschke A. Universal aptamer-based real-time monitoring of enzymatic RNA synthesis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135: 13692-13694Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, we focused on a generalizable assay amenable to most laboratories without the potential shortcomings of the Spinach RNA aptamer or complexity of ribozyme modules. We used a simple hybrid ssDNA template structure comprising a single-stranded antisense sequence encoding Broccoli RNA with only the T7 RNAP promoter region being double stranded. This template structure was originally described by the Uhlenbeck laboratory and is widely used for efficient transcription of small RNAs from synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (19Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Oligoribonucleotide synthesis using T7 RNA polymerase and synthetic DNA templates.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). Upon initiation of the reaction in the presence of DFHBI-1T, green fluorescence is observed within the first few minutes. Fluorescence was typically measured every minute in a standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) instrument in small 10-μl reactions in a 96-well format. By this method, Broccoli RNA aptamer synthesis and fluorescence are observed in real time (Fig. 1B), which provides a relative measurement of total RNA production over time. In most experiments, RNA transcripts from fluorescent reaction replicates were pooled and resolved by denaturing PAGE to compare staining on a gel to fluorescence-based detection. Resolution of RNA transcripts by denaturing PAGE sometimes resulted in multiple bands or higher-molecular-weight smearing. It is possible that the strong quadruplex nature of the Broccoli RNA aptamer (29Ageely E.A. Kartje Z.J. Rohilla K.J. Barkau C.L. Gagnon K.T. Quadruplex-flanking stem structures modulate the stability and metal ion preferences of RNA mimics of GFP.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) resulted in varying degrees of denaturation across experiments. Based on standard curves, the concentration of RNA produced can be estimated by the relative amount of fluorescence observed or the intensity of band staining by PAGE (Fig. S1, A–B). The overall concentration of MgCl2 and ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs), as well as their concentrations relative to one another, has been known to impact in vitro T7 RNAP transcription efficiency (22Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. [5] Synthesis of small RNAs using T7 RNA polymerase.Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 33Brunelle J.L. Green R. In vitro transcription from plasmid or PCR-amplified DNA.Methods Enzymol. 2013; 530: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The T7 RNAP enzyme itself requires a certain concentration of free magnesium to function, and the triphosphate groups on rNTPs can stoichiometrically chelate magnesium ions. It has been suggested that MgCl2 should be 6 mM above the concentration of rNTPs for optimal efficiency (22Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. [5] Synthesis of small RNAs using T7 RNA polymerase.Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 33Brunelle J.L. Green R. In vitro transcription from plasmid or PCR-amplified DNA.Methods Enzymol. 2013; 530: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, for standard transcription reactions the concentration of each rNTP is usually set at 4 mM (16 mM total rNTPs) while MgCl2 is set at a final concentration of 20 mM (19Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Oligoribonucleotide synthesis using T7 RNA polymerase and synthetic DNA templates.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). We decided to revisit this fundamental aspect of in vitro T7 transcription. We varied the MgCl2 concentration widely across total rNTP concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 mM under otherwise standard conditions (Fig. 1C). Maximal RNA synthesis at each rNTP concentration appeared to be centered on a MgCl2 concentration that was approximately 10 mM higher than the total rNTP concentration. This was observed at all three rNTP concentrations, suggesting that aptamer reporter dependence on Mg2+ does not contribute significantly to this effect. Nonetheless, although the Broccoli RNA aptamer was demonstrated to only require very low millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ (26Filonov G.S. Moon J.D. Svensen N. Jaffrey S.R. Broccoli: rapid selection of an RNA mimic of green fluorescent protein by fluorescence-based selection and directed evolution.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 16299-16308Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 29Ageely E.A. Kartje Z.J. Rohilla K.J. Barkau C.L. Gagnon K.T. Quadruplex-flanking stem structures modulate the stability and metal ion preferences of RNA mimics of GFP.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), its fluorescence may be influenced by increasing Mg2+ in our reactions and therefore may not translate to typical T7 RNAP transcription reactions. Although 30 mM rNTPs should support greater RNA synthesis, the conditions that produced the most consistent yield appeared to be 20 mM rNTPs with 30 mM MgCl2 (Fig. 1D, Fig. S2). These results suggest that both limiting and excessive MgCl2 can inhibit the activity of T7 RNAP. To confirm this, we instead held MgCl2 constant at 20 mM and titrated rNTPs from 10 mM up to 35 mM (Fig. S3A). The RNA yield was severely reduced when rNTP concentrations exceeded MgCl2 concentration. In addition, 50 mM MgCl2 was inhibitory in transcription reactions with 20 mM rNTPs when transcribing 7SK-Broccoli, a ∼450-nt template that encodes the human 7SK RNA sequence fused to the Broccoli RNA aptamer (Fig. S4A). Precipitates of Mg2+ and pyrophosphate are common during in vitro transcription reactions and can potentially alter the effective free Mg2+ concentration available for T7 RNAP. However, precipitation might be neutral or beneficial since the reduction of free Mg2+ would conceivably be proportional to consumption of rNTPs and would also remove potentially inhibitory pyrophosphate from solution. We included inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) in fluorescence reactions to prevent cloudiness and maintain accurate reading. Therefore, we investigated the effect of PPase at three different rNTP concentrations. When transcription products were resolved by denaturing PAGE, we did not observe any increase in transcription yield by the addition of PPase (Fig. S3B). Thus, we concluded that PPase or the formation of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitates is unlikely to alter the interpretation of results or cause unforeseen issues in fluorescence-based transcription screens. Together, these results support the importance of balancing and properly covarying rNTP and MgCl2 concentrations. These results are similar to previous reports but suggest that a slightly elevated concentration of Mg2+ during in vitro T7 transcription reactions could be beneficial. We decided to test other conditions fundamental to in vitro T7 RNAP transcription, which included the concentration of DNA template, T7 RNAP, monovalent ions, and polycations, as well as temperature and pH. Beginning with our standard conditions, we titrated the ssDNA hybrid template for Broccoli RNA transcription. As expected, the amount of DNA template proportionally increased the overall production of RNA transcript when the template was limiting (Fig. 2A). Transcription plateaued around 1.25 μM of template. Of importance, the amount of RNA made at each individual concentration of template also plateaued, indicating that longer incubations will not necessarily result in greater amounts of RNA when the template is limiting. Conversely, excess template did not seem to inhibit the reaction. When transcribing 7SK-Broccoli from a linearized plasmid template we observed a similar proportional increase in transcriptional output up to the final amount of 2 μg (0.2 μg/μl) at which point the total output appeared to begin plateauing (Fig. S4B). This is similar to the concentration of 1 to 3 μg of linearized plasmid per 20 μl reaction that is recommended in common commercial T7 transcription kits, such as the Ampliscribe T7-Flash Transcription Kit (Epicentre/Lucigen). In contrast to the synthetic DNA template encoding Broccoli, transcription of the longer 7SK-Broccoli from a linearized plasmid increased steadily over time at low template concentrations until reaching 1 μg of template (0.1 μg/μl) (Fig. S4B), suggesting that longer incubations may be required to produce more RNA product when plasmid DNA templates are limiting or when longer RNAs are transcribed. The amount of T7 RNAP affected not only the amount of RNA produced but also the rate at which it was produced (Fig. 2B). The transcription reaction reached completion much sooner when higher concentrations of T7 RNAP were present. For example, the reaction appears to have produced its maximum amount of RNA product at 30 min with 5 μM T7 RNAP while the product continues to increase steadily up to 60 min with 2.5 μM T7 RNAP. We also noted that Broccoli fluorescence was quenched at the highest concentrations of T7 RNAP, even though increasing amounts of transcript appeared to be synthesized when visualized by denaturing PAGE. Since Broccoli RNA aptamer fluorescence is sensitive to salts and DFHBI-1T interaction, it is possible that elevated concentrations of protein can partially titrate these or other components in the reaction. Overall, greater amounts of enzyme appear to proportionally increase transcript production independent of other factors. Nonetheless, exceeding 10 μM T7 RNAP under our standard conditions did not produce substantially greater yields and excess RNA polymerase has been reported to inhibit large-scale transcriptions (22Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. [5] Synthesis of small RNAs using T7 RNA polymerase.Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Thus, suboptimal concentrations of either template or T7 RNAP will limit overall synthesis of RNA, although in vitro transcription efficiency appears much more sensitive to T7 RNAP concentrations. When we tested transcription as a function of temperature using a temperature gradient setting on our qPCR instrument, we observed reduced fluorescence with increasing temperature (Fig. 3A). This was not surprising given that Broccoli RNA, like other folded RNA structures, is more stable at lower temperatures and therefore is expected to bind DFHBI-1T more stably to produce greater fluorescence. When pooled reactions were resolved by denaturing PAGE, transcript production was greatest around the 37.8 and 41.4 °C temperature points. Thus, it appears that transcription is most efficient"

However, looking at transient complexes remains challenging, as does determining structures in the context of the cellular environment. Braberg et al. used an integrative approach in which they mapped the phenotypic profiles of a comprehensive set of mutants in a protein complex in the context of gene deletions or environmental perturbations (see the Perspective by Wang). By associating the similarity between phenotypic profiles with the distance between residues, they determined structures for the yeast histone H3-H4 complex, subunits Rpb1-Rpb2 of yeast RNA polymerase II, and subunits RpoB-RpoC of bacterial RNA polymerase.

Though such devices are less accurate than PSG, sleep trackers may still provide valuable information. This study aimed to validate a commercial sleep tracker, Garmin Vivosmart 4 (GV4), against polysomnography (PSG) and to evaluate intra-device reliability (GV4 vs. GV4). Eighteen able-bodied adults (13 females, M = 56.1 ± 12.0 years) with no self-reported sleep disorders were simultaneously sleep monitored by GV4 and PSG for one night while intra-device reliability was monitored in one participant for 23 consecutive nights. Intra-device agreement was considered sufficient (observed agreement = 0.85 ± 0.13, Cohen’s kappa = 0.68 ± 0.24). GV4 detected sleep with high accuracy (0.90) and sensitivity (0.98) but low specificity (0.28). Cohen’s kappa was calculated for sleep/wake detection (0.33) and sleep stage detection (0.20). GV4 significantly underestimated time awake ( p = 0.001) including wake after sleep onset (WASO) ( p = 0.001), and overestimated light sleep ( p = 0.045) and total sleep time (TST) ( p = 0.001) (paired t -test). Sleep onset and sleep end differed insignificantly from PSG values. Our results suggest that GV4 is not able to reliably describe sleep architecture but may allow for detection of changes in sleep onset, sleep end, and TST (ICC ≥ 0.825) in longitudinally followed groups. Still, generalizations are difficult due to our sample limitations."
https://openalex.org/W3111008673,"Thyroid hormones are important modulators of metabolic activity in mammals and alter cholesterol and fatty acid levels through activation of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (THR). Currently, there are several THRβ agonists in clinical trials for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that have demonstrated the potential to reduce liver fat and restore liver function. In this study, we tested three THRβ-agonism-based NASH treatment candidates, GC-1 (sobetirome), MGL-3196 (resmetirom), and VK2809, and compared their selectivity for THRβ and their ability to modulate the expression of genes specific to cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism in vitro using human hepatic cells and in vivo using a rat model. Treatment with GC-1 upregulated the transcription of CPT1A in the human hepatocyte-derived Huh-7 cell line with a dose-response comparable to that of the native THR ligand, triiodothyronine (T3). VK2809A (active parent of VK2809), MGL-3196, and VK2809 were approximately 30-fold, 1,000-fold, and 2,000-fold less potent than T3, respectively. Additionally, these relative potencies were confirmed by quantification of other direct gene targets of THR, namely, ANGPTL4 and DIO1 . In primary human hepatocytes, potencies were conserved for every compound except for VK2809, which showed significantly increased potency that was comparable to that of its active counterpart, VK2809A. In high-fat diet fed rats, a single dose of T3 significantly reduced total cholesterol levels and concurrently increased liver Dio1 and Me1 RNA expression. MGL-3196 treatment resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with corresponding increases in liver gene expression, but the compound was significantly less potent than T3. In conclusion, we have implemented a strategy to rank the efficacy of THRβ agonists by quantifying changes in the transcription of genes that lead to metabolic alterations, an effect that is directly downstream of THR binding and activation."

Methods The study participants were women who had previously participated in a community-wide home-based HPV self-sampling pilot study, community health workers, women’s development army leaders, and the sample collectors of the home-based HPV self-sampling pilot study. A community based qualitative descriptive study was conducted. We applied purposive and convenience sampling. In total, 47 women participated in the study (in-depth interviews n = 22, four focus group discussions n = 25, 6–7 participants each). The study employed thematic analysis for clustering the emerged themes. Results Husband disapproval was identified as the main barrier to the acceptance of home-based HPV self-sampling. Social influence, lack of knowledge about cervical cancer and screening, lack of health education on cervical cancer and HPV-based screening, feeling healthy, and religious influence were identified as additional barriers. Fear of using Evalyn brush® for self-sampling was found to be the main barrier to the provision of a quality sample. The inability of the sample collectors to check the proper utilization of Evalyn brush® and the difficulty in understanding the instructions did also contribute to the low-quality. Providing health education concerning cervical cancer and HPV self-sapling to women, male involvement in the screening program, and linking the screening service to existing local health facilities were suggested to guarantee the success of home-based HPV self-sampling. Conclusions Educating women regarding cervical cancer and HPV testing, providing clear instructions on how to collect self-sample, and male involvement in the screening program are prerequisites for a successful implementation of home-based HPV testing. Women empowerment should also be focused to overcome the identified sociocultural barriers. Furthermore, the screening program should guarantee the timely provision of the test results and offering women follow-up examinations and treatment for abnormal findings."

Propolis has been used as a traditional medicine for multiple diseases, considering its particular composition and pharmaceutical properties that permits its wide applicability; it has also emerged as a potential antifungal agent. Thus, this study performed an in vitro and in vivo investigation into the efficacy of a new mucoadhesive thermoresponsive platform for propolis delivery (MTS-PRPe) in a preclinical murine model of VVC treatment caused by C . albicans . The methodologies involved chemical analysis, an assessment of the rheological and mucoadhesive properties of propolis formulations, in vitro and in vivo antifungal evaluations, histological evaluations and electron microscopy of the vaginal mucosa. The results demonstrated the antifungal activity of propolis extract and MTS-PRP against the standard strain and a fluconazole-resistant clinical isolate of C . albicans , in both in vitro and in vivo assays. These results were similar and even better, depending on the propolis concentration, when compared to nystatin. Thus, the formulation containing propolis exhibited good performance against C . albican s in a vulvovaginal candidiasis experimental model, representing a promising opportunity for the treatment of this infection."
https://openalex.org/W3110771170,"Background In clinical practice range of motion (RoM) is usually assessed with low-cost devices such as a tape measure (TM) or a digital inclinometer (DI). However, the intra- and inter-rater reliability of typical RoM tests differ, which impairs the evaluation of therapy progress. More objective and reliable kinematic data can be obtained with the inertial motion capture system (IMC) by Xsens. The aim of this study was to obtain the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the TM, DI and IMC methods in five RoM tests: modified Thomas test (DI), shoulder test modified after Janda (DI), retroflexion of the trunk modified after Janda (DI), lateral inclination (TM) and fingertip-to-floor test (TM). Methods Two raters executed the RoM tests (TM or DI) in a randomized order on 22 healthy individuals while, simultaneously, the IMC data (Xsens MVN) was collected. After 15 warm-up repetitions, each rater recorded five measurements. Findings Intra-rater reliabilities were (almost) perfect for tests in all three devices (ICCs 0.886–0.996). Inter-rater reliability was substantial to (almost) perfect in the DI (ICCs 0.71–0.87) and the IMC methods (ICCs 0.61–0.993) and (almost) perfect in the TM methods (ICCs 0.923–0.961). The measurement error (ME) for the tests measured in degree (°) was 0.9–3.3° for the DI methods and 0.5–1.2° for the IMC approaches. In the tests measured in centimeters the ME was 0.5–1.3cm for the TM methods and 0.6–2.7cm for the IMC methods. Pearson correlations between the results of the DI or the TM respectively with the IMC results were significant in all tests except for the shoulder test on the right body side (r = 0.41–0.81). Interpretation Measurement repetitions of either one or multiple trained raters can be considered reliable in all three devices."

Another feature of this class of GPCRs is an autoproteolytic site that is present at their GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which autocleaves aGPCRs into an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) for most of their family members (15Arac D.

There are several proposed activation mechanisms of aGPCRs. One of these mechanisms is the “tethered agonist” model (13Liebscher I. Schon J. Petersen S.C. Fischer L. Auerbach N. Demberg L.M. Mogha A.

In this model, the GAIN domain autoproteolysis exposes a tethered cryptic agonist sequence, designated as Stachel (German for stinger), within the N-terminal region of an aGPCR member, which induces receptor activation through its interaction with the 7TM domain. The tethered Stachel sequence located at the CTF plays an important role in aGPCR activation in response to different physiological stimulations, such as ligand binding, mechanostress, or removing of the NTF (13Liebscher I.

Furthermore, synthetic peptides mimicking the Stachel sequence are called Stachel peptides for each aGPCR receptor and have been shown to activate their corresponding aGPCRs (13Liebscher I. Schon J.

Adhesion G protein–coupled receptor G2(ADGRG2), also known as G protein–coupled receptor 64 (GPR64) or human epididymal gene product 6 (HE6), has attracted substantial attention for its specific expression and essential functions in the male reproductive system (22Obermann H.

Like most aGPCRs, ADGRG2 is still regarded as an orphan receptor with no identified endogenous ligands (11Purcell R.H. Hall R.A. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors as drug targets.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2018; 58: 429-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vitro, the overexpression of ADGRG2 caused constitutive Gs- and Gq-coupling activity, and a stronger effect was observed with the CTF truncation mutant ADGRG2 (ADGRG2-β) (5Zhang D.L. Sun Y.J. Ma M.L. Wang Y.J. Lin H. Li R.R. Liang Z.L. Gao Y. Yang Z. He D.F. Lin A. Mo H. Lu Y.J. Li M.J.

In our recent studies, we have found that ADGRG2 is specifically coupled to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) through a Gq- and β-arrestin1-mediated mechanism, regulating the ion/water homeostasis in efferent ductules, which is essential for male fertility. It has been shown that ADGRG2 could be activated by the Stachel peptide p15 (sequence: TSFGILLDLSRTSLP) derived from the Stachel sequence (23Demberg L.M. Rothemund S. Schoneberg T. Liebscher I.

Bone Miner.

Commun. 2015; 464: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to other peptidergic GPCRs, Stachel sequence–derived synthetic peptides have a significantly low affinity to the 7TM (13Liebscher I. Schon J. Petersen S.C. Fischer L. Auerbach N. Demberg L.M. Mogha A. Coster M. Simon K.U. Rothemund S. Monk K.R. Schoneberg T.

Schoneberg T. Tethered agonism: a common activation mechanism of adhesion GPCRs.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2016; 234: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For example, the Stachel peptide p15 has a significantly low affinity toward ADGRG2 (23Demberg L.M. Rothemund S. Schoneberg T. Liebscher I. Identification of the tethered peptide agonist of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor GPR64/ADGRG2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 464: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The low affinity of most Stachel peptides limits their in vivo studies. Chemical modification of the Stachel peptides may help to improve their affinity. Meanwhile, it remains to be revealed how the key residues in the 7TM domain sense the Stachel peptide binding and activate the receptor. Gaining more understanding into this question may greatly facilitate the design of peptidomics-based agonists for individual aGPCR members, which remains a great challenge in the field. In the current study, we identified important residues that contributed to the Stachel ADGRG2-peptide p15-induced ADGRG2 activation. According to our findings, we designed a systematic strategy to optimize the peptide-derived ADGRG2 agonist. We then obtained an optimized ADGRG2 Stachel peptide T1V/F3Phe(4-Me) (VPM-p15) that activated ADGRG2 with significantly improved affinity. Furthermore, we characterized the residues in ADGRG2 that are important for ADGRG2 activation in response to VPM-p15 engagement. First, it is necessary to confirm the activation of Stachel peptide p15 on ADGRG2. We generated an ADGRG2 mutant in which the entire ECD (including the entire GPS motif) was removed (ADGRG2-ΔGPS-β). Then, we measured the concentration-dependent p15 activities toward ADGRG2-ΔGPS-β and full-length ADGRG2(ADGRG2-FL) receptor. Increasing the amount of p15 led to a significant increase in cAMP levels, which was determined by the GloSensor assay (Fig. S1A). p15 also elicited a rise in the intracellular calcium level, which was determined using a CalfluxVTN Ca2+ assay. This change could be inhibited by the Gq/11 selective inhibitor YM-254890, suggesting that p15 induced the calcium influx via a Gq-dependent pathway (Fig. S1B). Of interest, we found through the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay that p15 promoted the recruitment of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 to ADGRG2, respectively (Fig. S1, C–D). It is notable that p15 induced significantly more recruitment of β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 through the truncated mutant compared with the wildtype ADGRG2. Moreover, the ADGRG2-β (CTF fragment) shows a significantly higher constitutive activity for arrestin recruitment compared with that of the wildtype ADGRG2 (Fig. S1, E–F). Because the Stachel sequence of ADGRG2-β could have more chance to access to the 7TM domain compared with that of the Stachel sequence in the ADGRG2 full length, these results indicate that the arrestin recruitment to ADGRG2 might be strengthened by the activation of ADGRG2 via Stachel sequence interaction. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the Stachel peptide p15 activates multiple signaling pathways downstream of ADGRG2. Among the three Stachel peptides of ADGRG2 (7, 13, 15 amino acids in length), p15 induced the strongest ADGRG2 activation (Fig. 1B). To find out which amino acid (aa) residues of p15 are required for receptor activation, we performed a systematic alanine scanning. The results showed that mutations of T1A and T12A enhanced p15 activity. Conversely, mutations of any residues from the middle of LLDL at positions ranging from +6 to +9, F3A, or R11A all greatly impaired p15 activity (Fig. 1C, Fig. S2 and Table S1). We next optimized p15 by amino acid substitution, according to the following strategies: (1) diversifying the noncritical residues identified in the alanine scanning to amino acids with different properties; (2) changing critical amino acids into natural or unnatural amino acids with different structures but similar properties (hydrophobicity, polarity, or charge); (3) enhancing the hydrophobicity of the C terminus of the Stachel peptide (Fig. 2A). First, we converted the Thr(T) at +1 position to F, W, H, R, K, D, E, V, respectively. Following strategy 1, the substitution of the polar T to a hydrophobic V at +1 position in T1V peptide induced about three times more cAMP accumulation compared with the wildtype p15, as determined by the GloSensor assay (Fig. 2B). Next, we changed the Ser(S) at +10 position to A, V, F, L; Thr(T) at +12 position to A, V, F, L to diversify the residue properties at these positions following strategy 2. We also changed +15 position to Tyr(Me) or P15(1-Nal), following strategy 3. However, these p15 mutants did not exhibit enhanced signal transduction capacities compared with the wildtype p15 (Fig. 2D). Finally, according to strategy 2, we mutated the Phe(F) at +3 position to unnatural amino acids Tyr(Me), Phe(4-CN), Phe(4F), Phe(4-Me), F3(2-Nal), F3(1-Nal), Phe(4-NO2). Interestingly, the F3Tyr(Me), F3Phe(4-Me), and F3(1-Nal) mutants showed higher signal transduction activities (Fig. 2C). According to the results of the above studies, concentration–response curves with p15 mutants T1V, F3Tyr(Me), F3Phe(4-Me), and F3(1-Nal) showed a lower EC50 value than wildtype p15 in the same second messenger assay (Fig. 2E). To further enhance the potency of the p15 mutants, we performed combined mutations of p15 for those who showed improvement at different p15 positions. The double mutants T1V/F3(1-Nal) and T1V/F3Phe(4-Me) (VPM-p15) showed a significant lower EC50 than other mutants, and the effect of the mutant VPM-p15 on EC50 was most profound, with an EC50 of 1.41 ± 0.16 μM and an approximately 170-fold increase compared with the wildtype p15 peptide (Fig. 2F and Table S2). In summary, we obtained an optimized ADGRG2 Stachel peptide VPM-p15 that more potently activated ADGRG2 compared with the wildtype p15 peptide. ADGRG2 has been shown to maintain the fluid reabsorption through coupling to both Gq and β-arrestin1 (5Zhang D.L. Sun Y.J. Ma M.L. Wang Y.J. Lin H. Li R.R. Liang Z.L. Gao Y. Yang Z. He D.F. Lin A. Mo H. Lu Y.J. Li M.J. Kong W. et al.Gq activity- and beta-arrestin-1 scaffolding-mediated ADGRG2/CFTR coupling are required for male fertility.eLife. 2018; 7e33432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the abilities of VPM-p15 on ADGRG2 to activate Gq by CalfluxVTN Ca2+ assay and to recruit β-arrestin by BRET assay. Concentration–response curves showed that VPM-p15 enhanced the abilities of ADGRG2 to activate both Gs and Gq (the Gq/11 selective inhibitor YM-254890 could reduce the intracellular calcium level), in both ADGRG2-FL, ADGRG2-ΔGPS-β overexpressed HEK293 cells (Fig. 3, A–D). Subsequently, VPM-p15 promoted the recruitment of β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 to the ADGRG2 truncated mutant ADGRG2-ΔGPS-β, ADGRG2-β, and ADGRG2-FL (Fig. 3, E–H, Fig. S3, A–B). Therefore, the optimized VPM-p15 induced both G protein and arrestin activations downstream of ADGRG2. To provide a foundation for further optimization of the ligand that activates ADGRG2, we then investigated the molecular mechanism of the engagement of VPM-p15 with ADGRG2. Through sequence alignment, we found that ADGRG2 Stachel sequences of the region p15 are highly conserved among different species (Fig. S4A). Because adhesion GPCRs are most homologous to class B GPCRs, we therefore used the PTH1R (a class B GPCR) and a Swiss-model software to generate an ADGRG2 three-dimensional coordinate model (Fig. 4A). According to this model, we then selected ADGRG2 mutations in extracellular loops 1, 2, 3, and transmembrane helices and then mutated them to alanine by QuikChange (Fig. 4, A–B and Fig. S4A). We transfected HEK293 cells with ADGRG2-ΔGPS-β WT or its corresponding mutants and detected the expression of receptors on the cell surface by cell-surface ELISA (Fig. S4B). We adjusted the amount of transfected plasmid and used the mutants without significant alterations of receptor-surface expression for further delineation of the ADGRG2-VPM-p15 engagement. The binding capacities of ADGRG2 WT or its mutants for VPM-p15 were determined by BRET assay, which has been used in previous studies (27Stoddart L.A. Johnstone E.K.M. Wheal A.J. Goulding J.

We fused the N terminus of ADGRG2 with a Rluc fragment and coupled FITC to the C terminus of VPM-p15 to facilitate BRET measurement. We stimulated the HEK293 cells transfected with Rluc-ADGRG2-ΔGPS-β wildtype (WT) or mutants by increasing the concentration of FITC-conjugated VPM-p15, and their binding abilities were determined by fitting the data with the saturation curves. The concentration–response curves of the binding abilities of the receptors to VPM-p15 are shown in the supplemental materials (Fig. S5 and Table S3). Of importance, mutations of two residues in ECL2, including W757ECL2 and I758ECL2, as well as the mutations of W8246.53 in TM6 (superscripts are based on Wooten’s numbering system for class B family GPCRs (30Wootten D. Simms J. Miller L.J. Christopoulos A. Sexton P.M. Polar transmembrane interactions drive formation of ligand-specific and signal pathway-biased family B G protein-coupled receptor conformations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 5211-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)), almost abolished the binding of VPM-p15 to ADGRG2 (Fig. 4C and Table S3). The binding results indicate that the TM6 and ECL2 regions are important for mediating the binding of VPM-p15 to ADGRG2. We then measured the effects of ADGRG2 mutants on VPM-p15-elicited cAMP accumulation. Among the 37 screened mutants, 12 significantly decreased their VPM-p15-induced ADGRG2 activities (Fig. 4D and Table S4). Three (W757ECL2, I758ECL2, and W8246.53) abolished intracellular cAMP accumulation, whereas F829 and F838 enhanced cAMP accumulation, and N759 ECL2, S760 ECL2, F8266.55, F8286.57, V836ECL3, I8447.53, and F8457.54 might reduce cAMP accumulation. The other residues, including F7645.35, Y7655.36, V7685.39, and F7725.43 may regulate receptor dynamics, which are important for transducing the ligand–binding signal to downstream coupled G proteins (Fig. 4D and Table S4). Both p15 and VPM-p15 were able to induce β-arrestin recruitment via ADGRG2. We therefore randomly picked several mutants that did not affect ligand binding and examined their effects on arrestin recruitment. Interestingly, two mutations, F764A and Y765A, showed improved activities toward both G protein and arrestin. In contrast, the mutations of V768A and F772A impaired both G protein and arrestin activities (Fig. 4D and Fig. S6, A–B). These results indicate that G protein and arrestin activity are mediated by at least several common residues located in the ADGRG2 7TM region. ADGRG2 belongs to the aGPCR subfamily, and many members of this family have been shown to function through G protein coupling (11Purcell R.H. Hall R.A.

https://openalex.org/W3111876237,"Glycoconjugates play a central role in several cellular processes, and alteration in their composition is associated with numerous human pathologies. Substrates for cellular glycosylation are synthesized in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is controlled by the glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransfera-se (GFAT). Human isoform 2 GFAT (hGFAT2) has been implicated in diabetes and cancer; however, there is no information about structural and enzymatic properties of this enzyme. Here, we report a successful expression and purification of a catalytically active recombinant hGFAT2 (rhGFAT2) in Escherichia coli cells fused or not to a HisTag at the C-terminal end. Our enzyme kinetics data suggest that hGFAT2 does not follow the expected ordered bi–bi mechanism, and performs the glucosamine-6-phosphate synthesis much more slowly than previously reported for other GFATs. In addition, hGFAT2 is able to isomerize fructose-6-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate even in the presence of equimolar amounts of glutamine, which results in unproductive glutamine hydrolysis. Structural analysis of a three-dimensional model of rhGFAT2, corroborated by circular dichroism data, indicated the presence of a partially structured loop in the glutaminase domain, whose sequence is present in eukaryotic enzymes but absent in the E. coli homolog. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this loop is the most flexible portion of the protein and plays a key role on conformational states of hGFAT2. Thus, our study provides the first comprehensive set of data on the structure, kinetics, and mechanics of hGFAT2, which will certainly contribute to further studies on the (patho)physiology of hGFAT2."
https://openalex.org/W3111893441,"Levansucrases (LSs) synthesize levan, a β2-6-linked fructose polymer, by successively transferring the fructosyl moiety from sucrose to a growing acceptor molecule. Elucidation of the levan polymerization mechanism is important for using LSs in the production of size-defined products for application in the food and pharmaceutical industries. For a deeper understanding of the levan synthesis reaction, we determined the crystallographic structure of Bacillus subtilis LS (SacB) in complex with a levan-type fructooligosaccharide and utilized site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues involved in substrate binding. The presence of a levanhexaose molecule in the central catalytic cavity allowed us to identify five substrate-binding subsites (−1, +1, +2, +3, and +4). Mutants affecting residues belonging to the identified acceptor subsites showed similar substrate affinity (Km) values to the wildtype (WT) Km value but had a lower turnover number and transfructosylation/hydrolysis ratio. Of importance, compared with the WT, the variants progressively yielded smaller-sized low-molecular-weight levans, as the affected subsites that were closer to the catalytic site, but without affecting their ability to synthesized high-molecular-weight levans. Furthermore, an additional oligosaccharide-binding site 20 A away from the catalytic pocket was identified, and its potential participation in the elongation mechanism is discussed. Our results clarify, for the first time, the interaction of the enzyme with an acceptor/product oligosaccharide and elucidate the molecular basis of the nonprocessive levan elongation mechanism of LSs."
https://openalex.org/W3110762985,"Background Greater sensitivity to food rewards and higher levels of impulsivity (and an interaction between these variables, termed “reinforcement pathology”) have been associated with obesity in cross-sectional studies. Less is known regarding how these constructs may impact attempts at weight loss or longer-term weight loss maintenance. Methods We provided 75 adults (69%Female, 84%White, age = 50.8y, BMI = 31.2kg/m 2 ) with a 3-month Internet-based weight loss program and assessed weight, food reward sensitivity (via the Power of Food Scale [PFS]), and impulsivity (via Go No-Go [GNG] and Delay Discounting [DD] computer tasks) at baseline and at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12. No additional intervention was provided Months 3–12. Multi-level mixed-effect models were used to examine changes in PFS, GNG, and DD over time and associations between these measures and weight loss/regain. Results Participants lost 6.0±1.1kg Months 0–3 and regained 2.4±1.1kg Months 3–12. Across time points, higher PFS scores were associated with higher weight, p = .007; however, there were no significant associations between GNG or DD and weight nor between the interactions of PFS and GNG or DD and weight, p s&gt;.05. There were significant decreases from Months 0–3 in PFS, GNG, and DD, p s &lt; .05; however, neither baseline values nor changes were significantly associated with weight change and there were no significant associations between the interactions of PFS and GNG or DD and weight change, p s&gt;.05. Conclusion Results demonstrated an association between food reward sensitivity and weight. Further, decreases in both food reward sensitivity and impulsivity were observed during an initial weight loss program, but neither baseline levels nor improvements were associated with weight change. Taken together, results suggest that the constructs of food reward sensitivity, impulsivity, and reinforcement pathology may have limited clinical utility within behavioral weight management interventions. Future intervention studies should examine whether food-related impulsivity tasks lead to a similar pattern of results."
https://openalex.org/W3111331438,"Despite the deployment of several effective control interventions in central-western Senegal, residual malaria transmission is still occurring in some hotspots. To better tailor targeted control actions, it is critical to unravel the underlying environmental and geographical factors that cause the persistence infection in hotspot villages. “Hotspots villages” were defined in our study as those reporting more than six indigenous malaria cases during the previous year. A total of ten villages, including seven hotspots and three non-hotspots, were surveyed. All potential mosquito breeding sites identified in and around the ten study villages were regularly monitored between 2013 and 2017. Monitoring comprised the detection of anopheline larvae and the collection of epidemiological, hydrogeological, topographical, and biogeographical data. The number of larval breeding sites described and monitored during the study period ranged from 50 to 62. Breeding sites were more numerous in hotspot sites in each year of monitoring, with 90.3% (56/62) in 2013, 90.9% (50/55) in 2014, 90.3% (56/62) in 2015 and 86% (43/50) in 2017 (Fisher exact test; p = 1). In the non-hotspot areas, the data for the same years were, respectively, 9.7% (6/62), 9.1% (5/55), 9.7% (6/62) and 14% (7/50) (p = 1). The Hotspot villages were characterized mostly by saline or moderately saline hydro-morphic and halomorphic soils allowing water retention and a potential larval breeding sites. By contrast, non-hotspot villages were characterized mainly by a high proportion of extremely permeable sandy-textured soils, which due to their porosity had low water retention. The annual number of confirmed malaria cases was correlated with the frequency and extent of breeding sites. Malaria cases were significantly more frequent in the hamlets located near breeding sites of An . gambiae s.l., gradually decreasing with increasing remoteness. This study shows that the characteristics of larval breeding sites, as measured by their longevity, stability, proximity to human habitation, and their positivity in Anopheles larvae are likely determining factors in the persistence of malaria hotspots in central-western Senegal. The results of this study shed more light on the environmental factors underlying the residual transmission and should make it possible to better target vector control interventions for malaria elimination in west-central Senegal."
https://openalex.org/W3111888325,"Actin is a major intracellular protein with key functions in cellular motility, signaling, and structural rearrangements. Its dynamic behavior, such as polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments in response to intracellular and extracellular cues, is regulated by an abundance of actin binding proteins. Out of these, gelsolin is one of the most potent for filament severing. However, myosin motor activity also fragments actin filaments through motor-induced forces, suggesting that these two proteins could cooperate to regulate filament dynamics and motility. To test this idea, we used an in vitro motility assay, where actin filaments are propelled by surface-adsorbed heavy meromyosin (HMM) motor fragments. This allows studies of both motility and filament dynamics using isolated proteins. Gelsolin, at both nanomolar and micromolar Ca2+ concentration, appreciably enhanced actin filament severing caused by HMM-induced forces at 1 mM MgATP, an effect that was increased at higher HMM motor density. This finding is consistent with cooperativity between actin filament severing by myosin-induced forces and by gelsolin. We also observed reduced sliding velocity of the HMM-propelled filaments in the presence of gelsolin, providing further support of myosin-gelsolin cooperativity. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy–based single molecule studies corroborated that the velocity reduction was a direct effect of gelsolin binding to the filament and revealed different filament severing pattern of stationary and HMM propelled filaments. Overall, the results corroborate cooperative effects between gelsolin-induced alterations in the actin filaments and changes due to myosin motor activity leading to enhanced F-actin severing of possible physiological relevance.

Actin is a major cytoskeletal protein, constituting 5 to 10% of the cellular protein content in eukaryotes (1Cooper G.M. The Cell: A Molecular Approach.2nd Ed.

It has vital roles not only in muscle contraction and nonmuscle cell motility but also in a variety of other cell functions such as intracellular transport, cytokinesis, membrane dynamics, cell signaling, and regulation of cell–cell contacts (3Aksnes H.

In muscle contraction and several other processes, actin filaments (F-actin) interact with the molecular motor myosin II to produce force and motion by sliding of actin and myosin relative to each other. Other functional roles of actin rely on its dynamic properties with polymerization and depolymerization regulated by a range of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) and varying cellular conditions (4Ballestrem C.

The gelsolin activity is regulated by the complex interplay between calcium (Ca2+), polyphosphoinositide 4, 5-bisphosphate and ATP (16Szatmári D. Xue B. Kannan B. Burtnick L.D. Bugyi B. Nyitrai M. Robinson R.C. ATP competes with PIP2 for binding to gelsolin.PLoS One. 2018; 13e0201826Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but it is also partially activated by low pH (17Lagarrigue E.

Binding of Ca2+ to several conserved sites on gelsolin, with Ca2+ affinities ranging from the 100 nM to 10 μM, changes gelsolin structure to facilitate binding to actin and subsequent actin filament severing (11Nag S.

A. 2009; 106: 13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After severing, gelsolin remains attached to the barbed end (fast polymerizing, plus end) of the filament, thus blocking addition of actin monomers (G-actin). However, gelsolin can also nucleate polymerization by binding to two G-actin units in vitro (19Badmalia M.D. Singh S. Garg R. Ashish Visualizing temperature mediated activation of gelsolin and its deactivation by Pip2: a Saxs based study.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The in vitro motility assay is a frequently used tool in studying the motion generated by the interaction between myosin and actin, powered by turnover of MgATP (22Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Factors affecting movement of F-actin filaments propelled by skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Assays for actin sliding movements over myosin-coated surfaces.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, myosin motor fragments such as heavy meromyosin (HMM) are adsorbed to modified glass surfaces in a controlled environment while the propulsion of fluorescently labeled actin filaments is observed using microscopy. The speed of the actin filament movement (sliding velocity) depends on several factors (22Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Factors affecting movement of F-actin filaments propelled by skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Månsson A. Translational actomyosin research: fundamental insights and applications hand in hand.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2012; 33: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), such as the density of myosin heads (HMM), MgATP concentration, ionic strength, pH, temperature, and the surface modification used for HMM adsorption. A lowered HMM surface density leads not only to reduced actin filament sliding velocity but also to a reduced filament fragmentation during the HMM propelled sliding (25Vogel S.K. Petrasek Z. Heinemann F. Schwille P. Myosin motors fragment and compact membrane-bound actin filaments.eLife. 2013; 2e00116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Such filament fragmentation is the basis for an increased number of filaments and reduced average length with time in the in vitro motility assay. However, importantly, actin filament fragmentation due to myosin motor activity may also have critical roles in cellular physiology (7Wegner A.

Zhang Q. Janmey P.A. Thomas D.D. Cooperativity in F-actin: binding of gelsolin at the barbed end affects structure and dynamics of the whole filament.J. Mol.

Biol. 1995; 245: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which may be expected to change the mode of actin binding of other proteins including myosin. Furthermore, one may consider the possibility of cooperativity between the filament severing induced by gelsolin binding on the one hand and myosin motor activity in the presence of MgATP on the other hand (44Orlova A. Egelman E.H. Structural dynamics of F-actin: I. Changes in the C terminus.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 582-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 45Orlova A. Prochniewicz E. Egelman E.H.

However, to the best of our knowledge, these issues have not been previously studied. Here, we therefore investigated the effect of gelsolin on HMM-induced actin filament sliding in the in vitro motility assay to assess possible gelsolin-induced changes in the myosin binding to actin or in the subsequent generation of motion. We also studied gelsolin-mediated F-actin severing during HMM propelled actin filament sliding and when actin filaments were bound to surface-immobilized HMM in the absence of motility. The experiments were performed either at a low [Ca2+] where little activation of actin binding and severing by gelsolin is expected (46Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Hurwitz C.

Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G. Probing the effects of calcium on gelsolin.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Experiments were further performed at different HMM surface densities and using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)–based single molecule observation of the gelsolin binding and severing pattern along actin. The results provide evidence for cooperative effects between HMM and gelsolin both in actin filament severing and in actomyosin motor function. The molecular mechanisms and the relevance of these findings in cellular function are discussed. The actin severing mechanism of gelsolin is complex. A Ca2+ concentration in the micromolar range (∼0.1–5 μM; pCa 5.3–7) is typically required to modify gelsolin to its fully active conformation (closed to open) that is competent for F-actin severing and barbed end capping (21Nag S.

However, other experimental conditions (e.g., concentration of reagents used in the assay in addition to Ca2+, such as gelsolin itself, actin, myosin, and ATP) may influence the gelsolin binding to actin filaments and the gelsolin-mediated filament splitting rates. To investigate the basal F-actin severing activity of the gelsolin preparations used in the present study under standardized conditions, we first checked the disassembly of actin filaments in solution in the presence of EGTA (1 mM) or CaCl2 (100 μM) (Fig. 1). These conditions correspond to pCa>9 and pCa 4.0, respectively. We used F-actin formed upon polymerization of 50% pyrene-labeled G-actin followed by dilution to a final concentration of 20 nM, below the barbed end critical concentration. These conditions favor the monitoring of spontaneous monomer dissociation. Filament disassembly kinetics was monitored by recording the pyrenyl emission as a function of time. In a first set of experiments, we found that the rate of spontaneous actin depolymerization is very low in the presence of EGTA, whereas addition of CaCl2 slightly favors the monomeric form of actin even in the absence of gelsolin (Fig. 1A). This may be attributed to the effects of the divalent cation on the mechanical properties of F-actin (51Nyitrai M. Hild G. Belágyi J. Somogyi B. The flexibility of actin filaments as revealed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The influence of divalent cations.J. Biol.

Next, we investigated the F-actin severing activity of gelsolin using two different gelsolin batches, where gelsolin was either unlabeled or labeled with Alexa-647 (Fig. 1B). The results from these assays, summarized in Figure 1C, demonstrate that in the absence of Ca2+ (1 mM EGTA), actin disassembly was not significantly influenced by addition of gelsolin (5 nM) at shorter timescales (<200 s) (Fig. 1, B–C). However, a slightly faster (∼1.6-fold) rate than that for spontaneous disassembly was detected in the presence of unlabeled gelsolin as compared with the labeled protein, an effect that became apparent at longer times. As expected, the disassembly rate was appreciably increased (∼20–35-fold) upon changing to excess CaCl2 (pCa 4.0) whether unlabeled or Alexa-647-labeled gelsolin was used (Fig. 1, B–C). Thus, the disassembly rates both in the absence and in the excess of Ca2+ were similar for Alexa-647-labeled and unlabeled gelsolin, and both proteins showed strong calcium dependent severing activity. To the best of our knowledge, the severing activity of gelsolin during an in vitro motility assay has not previously been reported. Here, we performed studies using this assay to elucidate the interactions between gelsolin-mediated F-actin severing and actin–myosin motor activity. First, we noted (Fig. S1, A–B) that at 5 nM gelsolin in the assay solution, the actin filaments were fragmented quite rapidly even at low [Ca2+] (pCa 8.2). If the Ca2+ concentration was increased to pCa 7.2 (Fig. S1C) and higher (tested for pCa 5.7 in Fig. S1D), the severing rate increased appreciably, leaving virtually no observable filaments left 30 s after initiation of the motility assay. We attribute this effect to the rapid severing and disassembly of F-actin (53Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cellular motility driven by assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 54Carlier M.F. Shekhar S. Global treadmilling coordinates actin turnover and controls the size of actin networks.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (cf. Fig. 1). We next tested gelsolin in the nanomolar range (0.75–1 nM) (55Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Ca2+ regulation of gelsolin activity: binding and severing of F-actin.Biophys.

First, we noted that the number of filaments in the in vitro motility assay increased with time even in the absence of gelsolin because of fragmentation by myosin-induced forces (Fig. 2, A60_control). However, we also noted that the rate of severing at 1 nM gelsolin was sufficiently slow to allow microscopy-based quantitative analysis of the severing rate. At the lowest HMM surface density tested (HMM incubation concentration 171.4 nM), we observed an approximately two-fold early increase (0–60 s) in the number of actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay in the presence of gelsolin as compared with its absence (Fig. 2). The HMM incubation concentration of 171.4 nM is expected to give less than saturating density of HMM on the motility assay surface (e.g., (56Sundberg M. Balaz M. Bunk R. Rosengren-Holmberg J.P. Montelius L. Nicholls I.A. Omling P. Tågerud S. Månsson A.

J. 2016; 111: 1465-1477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); supplemental information of latter paper). Remarkably, with a higher HMM incubation concentration (342.8 nM), expected to saturate the surface (56Sundberg M. Balaz M. Bunk R. Rosengren-Holmberg J.P. Montelius L. Nicholls I.A. Omling P. Tågerud S. Månsson A. Selective spatial localization of actomyosin motor function by chemical surface patterning.Langmuir. 2006; 22: 7302-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), there was a 5- to 7-fold increase in the number of actin filaments within 60 s in the presence of gelsolin as compared with control samples (Fig. 2). The increase in the filament number with time was significantly higher than in the absence of gelsolin as indicated by nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals. It should also be noted from the data in Figure 2 that in these experiments, increased HMM surface density had negligible effects on the motor induced severing in the absence of gelsolin. The marked difference between the effects of increased HMM density on motor induced severing in the presence and absence of gelsolin (with minimal effects of gelsolin at the lowest motor density) suggests cooperative effects between gelsolin induced severing and motor induced severing. We also studied the effects of varying HMM density on gelsolin-mediated fragmentation at low [Ca2+] (pCa 8.2) in Figure 3 as compared with the high [Ca2+] (pCa 5.7) used in Figure 2. The use of low [Ca2+] (Fig. 3) allowed us to increase the gelsolin concentration to 5 nM without filament severing being too fast for microscopy-based quantification. An increased actin filament fragmentation rate is observed for increased HMM incubation concentration in the range 171.4 to 342.8 nM. Importantly, similar to the situation at 1 nM gelsolin and high [Ca2+] (Fig. 2), the number of filaments increased to greater extent with time (from 0 to 60 s) in the presence than in the absence of gelsolin (5 nM) at low [Ca2+] (Fig. 3). However, the effect of gelsolin was only observed at the two highest HMM concentrations used. This is clearly seen from a summary of the results corresponding to the 60 s time points as shown in the inset of Figure 3. The findings in Figure 3 suggest that gelsolin binds to the actin filaments also at low [Ca2+] ([pCa 8.2], see further below). The results further suggest that gelsolin bound to actin at low [Ca2+] potentiates fragmentation of the filaments because of the forces produced by myosin motor activity. To summarize, the results in Figure 3 suggest that, also at low [Ca2+], gelsolin addition noticeably increases the HMM-induced actin filament severing, at least at the highest HMM densities studied. These findings are consistent with cooperative effects between motor-induced and g"

Here we compared routines for antibiotic use between pig farms of two different levels of intensification in Khon Kaen province in Thailand. Among the 113 family-owned small-scale farms (up to 50 sows) interviewed did 76% get advice from the pharmacy about how to use the antibiotics and 84% used it primarily for treating disease. Among the 51 medium-scale-farms (100–500 sows) belonging to two companies did 100% get advice about antibiotic use from the company’s veterinarian (P&lt;0.0001) and 94% used antibiotics mostly as disease preventive measure (P&lt;0.0001). In 2 small scale farms 3 rd generation cephalosporins, tylosin or colistin were used; antibiotics belonging to the group of highest priority critically important antimicrobials for human medicine. Enrofloxacin, belonging to the same group of antimicrobials, was used in 33% of the small-scale and 41% of the medium-scale farms. In the latter farms, the companies supplied 3–4 antibiotics belonging to different classes and those were the only antibiotics used in the farms. The median and mean estimated expenditure on antibiotics per sow was 4.8 USD (IQR = 5.8) for small-scale farms and 7 USD and 3.4 USD for the medium-scale farms belonging to the two respective companies. Our observations suggest to target the following areas when pig farming transitions from small-scale to medium-scale: (i) strengthening access to professional animal health services for all farmers, (ii) review of the competence and role of veterinary pharmacies in selling antibiotics and (iii) adjustment of farming company animal health protocols towards more medically rational use of antibiotics."

Proteins are modified by a variety of posttranslational modifications (PTM) including phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, and methylation, which are known to play key roles in modulating protein function. Protein methylation is one of the most important histone modifications, affecting changes in gene transcription (1Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7315) Google Scholar, 2Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Translating the histone code.Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7177) Google Scholar). Recently, numerous methylation sites in nonhistone proteins have been discovered, and methylation has been reported to play a role in both fundamental biological processes and disease states such as cancer (3Hamamoto R.

Mongeon V. Figeys D. Couture J.F. The functional diversity of protein lysine methylation.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10: 724Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nearly 1% of human genes encode methyltransferases (6Petrossian T.C. Clarke S.G. Uncovering the human methyltransferasome.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2011; 10M110.000976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), highlighting the diversity of ligands and the importance of methylation in maintaining homeostasis. Yet the majority of methyltransferases remain to be functionally characterized. Indeed, although growing numbers of methylation sites in nonhistone proteins have been identified using recently developed mass spectrometry–based techniques (7Ong S.E. Mittler G. Mann M. Identifying and quantifying in vivo methylation sites by heavy methyl SILAC.Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Geoghegan V. Guo A. Trudgian D. Thomas B. Acuto O. Comprehensive identification of arginine methylation in primary T cells reveals regulatory roles in cell signalling.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the function of specific methylations often remains unknown (4Biggar K.K. Li S.S.C.

Historically, antibodies have played a major role in advancing basic and translational research into PTM. The advent of phosphosite-specific antibodies led to an explosion in phosphorylation research and demonstrated the ubiquity of this protein modification in cellular processes. However, methylsite-specific monoclonal antibodies remain rare to nonexistent (10Hattori T. Lai D. Dementieva I.S. Montaño S.P. Kurosawa K. Zheng Y. Akin L.R. Świst-Rosowska K.M. Grzybowski A.T. Koide A. Krajewski K. Strahl B.D. Kelleher N.L. Ruthenburg A.J. Koide S. Antigen clasping by two antigen-binding sites of an exceptionally specific antibody for histone methylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and lack of highly specific antibodies often becomes a bottleneck for subsequent functional studies after identifying a new methylation site (11Hattori T. Koide S. Next-generation antibodies for post-translational modifications.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2018; 51: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For both ease of use and adaptability to currently available techniques, monoclonal antibodies remain ideal tools for the recognition of site-specific PTM. Although several studies have attempted to create artificial receptors that can recognize methylated lysines (12Gruber T. Synthetic receptors for the recognition and discrimination of post-translationally methylated lysines.ChemBioChem. 2018; 19: 2324-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), these cannot be easily employed in basic immunochemical assays such as Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry owing to low affinity and a lack of sequence specificity surrounding the modification site. Indeed, protein methylation is considered one of the most difficult targets to create modification-specific antibodies owing to the minute differences in chemical moieties brought by the addition of -CH3 group(s) (10Hattori T. Lai D. Dementieva I.S. Montaño S.P. Kurosawa K. Zheng Y. Akin L.R. Świst-Rosowska K.M. Grzybowski A.T. Koide A. Krajewski K. Strahl B.D. Kelleher N.L. Ruthenburg A.J. Koide S.

Selection-based technology (such as phage display) rather than screening-based technologies (such as hybridoma methods) can take advantage of the power of directed evolution to select for antibody clones possessing the desired function, given sufficient selection pressure during iterative rounds of panning. Typically, a peptide sequence containing the target modification is used for immunization, with subsequent selection from the immune repertoire of the immunized animal to obtain the site-specific antibodies. However, the dominant immune response elicits modification-specific antibodies that only recognize peptide antigen in ELISA, while antibodies that also recognize protein antigen in biochemical applications such as Western blot are less common. In particular, most currently available methylation-specific monoclonal antibodies target histone tails, which are unstructured and thought to behave like peptides (1Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7315) Google Scholar, 10Hattori T. Lai D. Dementieva I.S. Montaño S.P. Kurosawa K.

A. 2016; 113: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated trimethylated lysine-specific antibodies using a methylated peptide derived from MAP3K2 (Lys260). MAP3K2 is methylated by the oncogenic methyltransferase SMYD3, and methylation of Lys260 has been linked to functional regulation of this kinase (13Colón-Bolea P. Crespo P.

Vermeulen M. et al.SMYD3 links lysine methylation of MAP3K2 to Ras-driven cancer.Nature. 2014; 510: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The antibody was created using our original technology that pairs rabbit immunization with selection using fully rabbit (not chimeric) Fab-phage display, and this report can be considered the first detailed characterization of an antibody obtained with this technology. Six unique methylsite-specific Fabs were identified by initial peptide ELISA and further analyzed by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and Western blot. Further detailed analysis of the antibody–antigen complex for four Fabs was performed by X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations. Together with the results of functional analyses, we discuss the characteristics of molecular recognition by functional methylsite-specific antibodies. To generate methylsite-specific antibodies, rabbits were immunized with a MAP3K2 peptide sequence surrounding trimethylated Lys260 (Fig. 1, A–B), N-terminally conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). After confirmation of a robust and methylation-specific serum response by ELISA, bone marrow and spleen RNA were extracted and a Fab phagemid library was constructed. Fabs were selected by several rounds of biopanning on bovine serum albumin (BSA)-conjugated methylated peptide antigen, with subtraction of nonspecific binders by including an excess of soluble nonmethylated peptide in solution during the binding step (Fig. 1C). Screening of selected Fab clones was carried out by soluble Fab-ELISA (Fig. S1). The absorbance derived from the binding to the BSA-conjugated methylated peptide was compared with that of the unconjugated nonmethylated peptide, and the DNA sequences of methyl-specific clones were analyzed. The Fab clones were divided into six clusters (Fig. 1D) based on the identities of the CDR H3 sequences, and six Fab clones, named E10, F9, C9, E7, E6, and D6, from each cluster that contained more than two unique sequences (clusters 1–5) were chosen for further analysis. The ELISA signal for each clone is summarized in Table S1, and the CDR sequences (based on Chothia definition) of select clones are given in Figure 1E. It is notable that despite the Fabs recognizing the same antigen, each of the Fabs characterized in detail possesses a unique CDR L3 sequence of 10 to 13 amino acids in length and a unique CDR H3 sequence (with the exception of two clones sharing identical H3 sequences) of 5, 6, or 9 amino acids in length. To evaluate the specificity against methylation, we prepared each antibody as a Fab construct, which consists of the antigen-binding domain in antibodies (15Vidarsson G. Dekkers G. Rispens T. IgG subclasses and allotypes: from structure to effector functions.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 520Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), as a purified recombinant protein and determined binding affinity as well as kinetic parameters toward both unconjugated trimethylated and nonmethylated peptides by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2). The KD values toward methylated and nonmethylated peptides for all the Fabs are plotted in Figure 2B, and the binding affinity and kinetic parameters of the interaction are summarized in Table S2. The result showed that F9, C9, E6, and D6 preferentially bound to the methylated peptide as consistent with Fab ELISA. These clones possessed affinities of 3.0 ×102, 14, 0.90, and 54 nM, respectively, for the methylated peptide. Affinities for the nonmethylated peptides were within the millimolar to 0.3-μM range. It is surprising that E10 showed a similar weak binding to both peptides with 40 μM KD affinity, contrary to ELISA. It is intriguing that E7 did not show any significant binding response in SPR, although ELISA indicates a strong binding activity to the methylated peptide. This is presumably a result of the different peptide presentations in the two assays; ELISA used immobilized, BSA-conjugated peptide antigen, and SPR used soluble free peptide antigen (with immobilized Fab). To examine this hypothesis, we prepared the methylated peptide conjugated with another carrier protein human serum albumin and conducted ELISA analysis. The result showing that E7 bound to the conjugated peptide (Fig. S3) would support the above hypothesis that E7 recognized not solely the peptide sequence but the local structure induced by conjugation with carrier proteins. Furthermore, as MAP3K2 Lys260 can also be mono- and di-methylated (16Van Aller G.S. Graves A.P. Elkins P.A. Bonnette W.G. McDevitt P.J. Zappacosta F. Annan R.S. Dean T.W. Su D.S. Carpenter C.L. Mohammad H.P. Kruger R.G. Structure-based design of a novel SMYD3 inhibitor that bridges the SAM-and MEKK2-binding pockets.Structure. 2016; 24: 774-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we conducted SPR analysis using mono- and di-methylated peptides to evaluate the specificity of each antibody toward the methylation state of the peptide. The result showed that the affinity increased with greater methylation degree, although this dependency was not identical among the antibodies (Table S3). These results suggest that, although the antibodies also recognize the mono- and di-methylated antigen, they have some specificity (especially for C9 and D6) toward the degree of methylation. To assess the sequence specificity for the Fabs possessing high affinity to the methylated peptide, F9, C9, E6, and D6 were tested by SPR using a histone H4 peptide containing K5 trimethylation, which possess three consensus amino acid sequences surrounding the methylation site with MAP3K2 (GK(me3)GG). Although C9 and D6 showed detectable binding to the H4 peptide, the affinity was significantly lower than that toward the target peptide (Fig. 2C). In addition, C9 and D6 showed essentially no affinity (approximately millimolar level) to a peptide derived from histone H3 containing a trimethylated K27, which possess different amino acids sequences surrounding the trimethylated lysine (Fig. S4). These results suggest that these Fabs are not only methylated lysine specific but are also methylsite specific, as they have a strong specificity toward methylated lysine in the context of MAP3K2 surrounding amino acids. We next sought to test whether these Fabs recognize methylated protein antigen in the context of other cellular proteins. We converted the clones to rabbit IgG format for Western blot analysis. HEK293 cells were transfected with a MAP3K2 expression vector together with either a mock or SMYD3 expression vector, as SMYD3 upregulation has been shown to methylate Lys260 of MAP3K2 (13Colón-Bolea P. Crespo P. Lysine methylation in cancer: SMYD3-MAP3K2 teaches us new lessons in the Ras-ERK pathway.Bioessays. 2014; 36: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Mazur P.K. Reynoird N. Khatri P. Jansen P.W.T.C. Wilkinson A.W. Liu S. Barbash O. Van Aller G.S. Huddleston M. Dhanak D. Tummino P.J. Kruger R.G. Garcia B.A. Butte A.J. Vermeulen M. et al.SMYD3 links lysine methylation of MAP3K2 to Ras-driven cancer.Nature. 2014; 510: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Both MAP3K2 and SMYD3 expressions were confirmed by analysis of HA or FLAG tags, respectively (Fig. 3A). Each IgG clone was then tested by Western blot (Fig. 3B). Two off-target bands appeared on staining with F9, neither of which corresponds to the expected size of MAP3K2 and the intensity of which is not dependent on SMYD3 expression. This result indicates that F9 does not appear to recognize protein antigen. On the contrary, the band corresponding to MAP3K2 was clearly shown by staining with C9 and D6 in a SMYD3 expression-dependent manner. Although some bands, which might be derived from other trimethylated proteins that possess similar amino acids surrounding methylated lysine, were also observed in a SMYD3 expression-dependent manner, the band derived from MAP3K2 was dominant, guaranteeing the specificity of the antibodies. Furthermore, to verify that these antibodies indeed recognized the methylated Lys260, detection using the MAP3K2 K260A mutant was tested. The corresponding band was significantly diminished by the mutation for both C9 and D6 (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that these antibodies specifically recognize methylated Lys260 residue. It is intriguing that E6 staining only showed a faint band despite possessing the highest affinity among the Fabs toward the methylated peptide. These results indicate that antigen affinity alone is not predictive of antibody behavior in other applications such as Western blotting, especially when the application involves full-length protein antigen. To gain further insight into how the antibodies recognize the antigen, we determined the crystal structures of each Fab–methylated peptide complex. Omit electron density maps of the peptides indicate with a high degree of confidence that these peptides are bound to the antibodies in the crystal (Fig. S5). Antibodies F9 and E6 engage the peptide predominantly using their heavy chain, with the methylated lysine pointing toward the light chain (Fig. 4A). These similar binding modes could be expected, as the heavy chain CDRs of F9 and E6 differ by only a single amino acid in CDRs H1 and H2 (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, the methylated lysine residue was deeply buried in the interface between the heavy and light chains in C9 and in D6, both of which recognized the protein antigen in Western blotting. Indeed, the calculated accessible surface area of the methylated lysine residue side chain in each complex (F9, 45.3 Å2; C9, 3.8 Å2; E6, 34.0 Å2; and D6, 0.0 Å2) clearly demonstrates the nearly complete penetration of the methylated lysine residue into the interchain cleft for C9 and D6. Of importance, both the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the peptide were not observed in the complex suggesting that each terminus is disordered. This binding mode may be compatible with antigen recognition in the context of the intact protein, as would occur in Western blotting. Meanwhile, the full C terminus of the peptide was observed in structures of the complex in other Fabs. By studying the local environment surrounding the methylated lysine residues, we found that the four antibody clones examined recognize the methylated lysine residue by using several aromatic residues in a cooperative manner (Fig. 4B). The pockets formed with the aromatic residues, termed “aromatic cage,” are also observed in reader proteins working in the recognition of histone modifications and an antimethylated histone antibody (10Hattori T. Lai D. Dementieva I.S. Montaño S.P. Kurosawa K. Zheng Y. Akin L.R. Świst-Rosowska K.M. Grzybowski A.T. Koide A. Krajewski K. Strahl B.D. Kelleher N.L. Ruthenburg A.J. Koide S.

How chromatin-binding modules interpret histone modifications: lessons from professional pocket pickers.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). These structures strongly suggest that these Fabs acquired their specificity toward methylation by using the same structural principles. Considering that each Fab uses different combinations of aromatic residues, i.e., F9 uses two Tyr and one Trp, C9 uses two Phe and one Tyr, E6 uses three Tyr, and D6 uses three Trp, the combination of aromatic residue is not likely to be a fundamental for the recognition of methylated lysine residue, instead indicating the general importance of the CH–pi interaction (18Nishio M. Umezawa Y. Hirota M. Takeuchi Y. The CH/π interaction: significance in molecular recognition.Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 8665-8701Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar) between the aromatic residues and methyl groups in the methylated lysine. Looking at the entire peptide in the complexes, each Fab also made hydrogen bonds as well as salt bridges with other parts of the peptide. All the hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, calculated by PDBePISA (19Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (5906) Google Scholar), are summarized in Supplementary Note 1. F9 and E6 each engaged in 17 hydrogen bonds and 4 salt bridges with the methylated peptide (Fig. S6). On the other hand, C9 and D6 each made seven hydrogen bonds with the peptide (Fig. S6). The fewer hydrogen bonds observed in C9 and D6 compared with F9 and E6, together with the comparable affinity ranges among the Fabs, also suggests the large contribution that deeply located aromatic cages play in peptide binding. Of importance, F9 and E6 engaged in several hydrogen bonds as well as salt bridges with the peptide’s C-terminal carboxyl group, which may explain why these Fabs cannot recognize the full-length protein. To confirm the contribution of these noncovalent bonds with the C-terminal carboxyl group, we conducted SPR analysis using a methylated peptide in which the C terminus was amidated (Fig. S7). The results show that the binding response of the amidated peptide was nearly abolished for F9 and E6, whereas in contrast C9 and D6 recognized the amidated peptide with comparable affinity with that of the nonamidated peptide. This demonstrates that the major reason that F9 and E6 do not recognize protein antigen is their bonding to the C-terminal carboxyl group, which would be incompatible with binding in the context of the full protein sequence. To further characterize the recognition of the methylated lysine residue by the aromatic cages and to explore the possibility of in silico prediction of specificity toward methylation for each antibody, we conducted multiple 400-ns molecular dynamics simulations for each Fab–peptide complex. First, we calculated the RMSD values of the NZ atoms of the methylated lysine after superposing the side-chain atoms of aromatic residues in each structure. The RMSD plots indicate that the methylated lysine residue was stably bound by the aromatic cage in C9, E6, and D6, whereas it dynamically moved in the F9 complex (Fig. 5A). Of importance, the F9 structure showed that the methylated lysine was completely thrown out from the cage at several time points during the simulations, and the antibody retained the peptide only through interaction with the C terminus (Fig. S8). This exclusion of the methylated lysine residue from the aromatic cage was also confirmed by the calculation of the solvent accessible surface area of the methylated lysine residue (Fig. S9). This result appears to be concordant with the SPR results, which showed that C9, E6, and D6 have higher preference toward methylated peptide compared with F9, indicating that our simulations appropriately recaptures antigen recognition observed in the in vitro experiments. We subsequently evaluated the stability of the aromatic cage formation in C9 andD6, both of which recognized protein antigen, to assess if the cages stably form regardless of the antigen. We calculated RMSD values of the all the carbon and nitrogen atoms of the three aromatic residues that form the cages after superposing all the Cα atoms of each complex for both the Fab–methylated peptide complex and apo-Fabs, which were computationally generated based on the crystal structures of the complexes (Fig. 5B). The results showing large fluctuation of RMSD values in the apo structures indicate that the relative position of aromatic residues to each other continuously changed; i.e., the cage collapsed in the absence of peptide antigen, suggesting that the aromatic cages would stably form only in the presence of the antigen even in the C9 and D6 antibodies. In the present study, we created antibodies that recognize the peptide antigen in a methylation-dependent manner by using rabbit immunization followed by antibody library construction and phage display-based selection. This is the first report of detailed structural characterization of antibodies elicited by the use of this novel technique that pairs rabbit immunization with phage display. It is worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge, this is also the first study to characterize the structural and biophysical basis for recognition of a protein antigen by a series of methylation-specific antibodies. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generally possess higher affinity (picomolar versus nanomolar KD) over their mouse and human counterparts (20Borras L. Gunde T. Tietz J. Bauer U. Hulmann-Cottier V. Grimshaw J.P.A. Urech D.M. Generic approach for the generation of stable humanized single-chain Fv fragments from rabbit monoclonal antibodies.J. Biol.

Antibody discovery: sourcing of monoclonal antibody variable domains.Curr. Drug Discov. Technol. 2014; 11: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Owing to an increased CDR3 length and sequence diversity, recombinant rabbit MAbs have been shown to provide high-quality detection for difficult epitopes including PTM such as phosphorylation and methylation, especially when MAbs from other species had failed (23Chen Y. Vaine M. Wallace A. Han D. Wan S. Seaman M.S. Montefiori D. Wang S. Lu S. A novel rabbit monoclonal antibody platform to dissect the diverse repertoire of antibody epitopes for HIV-1 Env immunogen design.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 10232-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, traditional rabbit mAb platforms rely on hybridoma technology or B cell cloning to generate lead candidates and these systems suffer from limited library sizes (104–106, compared with 1010–1011 in phage display). Also, clone recovery by single cell PCR can be inefficient, causing loss of important lead candidates. Alternatively, historical rabbit phage display systems have failed to compensate for the unique disulfide architecture of rabbit Fabs that can cause expression problems in Escherichia. coli, where the most commonly used Ck1 chain possesses an additional disulfide bond that is not found in mouse or human kappa chains. This led to the development of suboptimal systems that are limited to the underutilized Ck2 chain and thus do not use the full rabbit immune repertoire. To overcome these challenges, we used a patented library construction method paired with an optimized proprietary Fab–phage display vector (containing a hairpin structure to prevent transcription by leaky lac-promoter and strictly controlling the production of Fabs in native state) that allows for display of fully rabbit Fab in the natural form without needing to rely on chimeric alternatives.

CEH-60, a homolog of the TALE transcription factor PBX in vertebrates, was recently characterized as a new regulator of intestinal lipid mobilization in Caenorhabditis elegans . Because CEH-60’s orthologs and paralogs exhibit several other functions, notably in neuron and muscle development, and because ceh-60 expression is not limited to the C . elegans intestine, we sought to identify additional functions of CEH-60 through DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID). DamID identifies protein-genome interaction sites through GATC-specific methylation. We here report 872 putative CEH-60 gene targets in young adult animals, and 587 in L2 larvae, many of which are associated with neuron development or muscle structure. In light of this, we investigate morphology and function of ceh-60 expressing AWC neurons, and contraction of pharyngeal muscles. We find no clear functional consequences of loss of ceh-60 in these assays, suggesting that in AWC neurons and pharyngeal muscle, CEH-60 function is likely more subtle or redundant with other factors."
https://openalex.org/W3113069448,"Background Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is one of the major causes of acute viral hepatitis. HAV genotypes and its genetic diversity is rarely investigated in our region as well as worldwide. Aims The aims of the present study were to determine the HAV genotypes and its risk factors and to investigate the genetic diversity of the HAV isolates in the West Bank, Palestine. Study design A cohort of 161 clinically and laboratory-confirmed HAV (IgM-positive) cases and 170 apparently healthy controls from all the districts of the West Bank, Palestine during the period of 2014 to 2016 were tested for HAV infection using IgM antibodies, RT-PCR and sequence analysis of the VP3/VP1 junction region of the HAV genome. Phylogenetic analysis, genetic diversity and haplotypes analysis were used to characterize the VP3/VP1 sequences. Results All the 34 sequences of the HAV were found to be of HAV-IB sub-genotype. The phylogenetic analysis showed four main clusters with cluster III exclusively consisting of 18 Palestinian isolates (18/23-78%), but with weak bootstrap values. A high haplotype diversity (Hd) and low nucleotide diversity (π) were observed. Cluster III showed high number of haplotypes (h = 8), but low haplotype (gene) diversity (Hd = 0.69). A total of 28 active haplotypes with some consisting of more than one sequence were observed using haplotype network analysis. The Palestinian haplotypes are characterized by closely related viral haplotypes with one SNV away from each other which ran parallel to cluster III in the phylogenetic tree. A smaller Palestinian haplotype (4 isolates) was three SNVs away from the major haplotype cluster (n = 10) and closer to others haplotypes from Iran, Spain, and South Africa. Young age, low level of parent’s education, infrequent hand washing before meals, and drinking of un-treated water were considered the major HAV risk factors in the present study. Conclusion Haplotype network analysis revealed haplotype variation among the HAV Palestinian sequences despite low genetic variation and nucleotide diversity. In addition, this study reconfirmed that age and parent’s level of education as HAV risk factors, while hand washing and treating drinking water as protective factors."
https://openalex.org/W3113193245,"Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson kinase (BCR–Abl) is a driver oncogene that causes chronic myeloid leukemia and a subset of acute lymphoid leukemias. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors provide an effective treatment for these diseases, they generally do not kill leukemic stem cells (LSCs), the cancer-initiating cells that compete with normal hematopoietic stem cells for the bone marrow niche. New strategies to target cancers driven by BCR–Abl are therefore urgently needed. We performed a small molecule screen based on competition between isogenic untransformed cells and BCR–Abl-transformed cells and identified several compounds that selectively impair the fitness of BCR–Abl-transformed cells. Interestingly, systems-level analysis of one of these novel compounds, DJ34, revealed that it induced depletion of c-Myc and activation of p53. DJ34-mediated c-Myc depletion occurred in a wide range of tumor cell types, including lymphoma, lung, glioblastoma, breast cancer, and several forms of leukemia, with primary LSCs being particularly sensitive to DJ34. Further analyses revealed that DJ34 interferes with c-Myc synthesis at the level of transcription, and we provide data showing that DJ34 is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. Physiologically, DJ34 induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cell differentiation.

Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson kinase (BCR–Abl) is the driver mutation for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is also found in 25% to 30% of Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+) adult acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (1Rowley J.D.

Genomics in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: insights and treatment implications.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2015; 12: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). CML and Ph+ ALL are effectively treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib. However, development of TKI resistance remains an issue, survival of Ph+ ALL patients is suboptimal, and new treatment strategies are required (3Fielding A.K. Rowe J.M. Buck G. Foroni L. Gerrard G.

BCR–Abl activates downstream signaling pathways that promote cell survival and proliferation and that inhibit differentiation, such as the Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3K–Akt pathways (4Cilloni D. Saglio G. Molecular pathways: BCR-ABL.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Another critical component of the BCR–Abl network is the transcription factor c-Myc (5Sawyers C.L. Callahan W. Witte O.N. Dominant negative MYC blocks transformation by ABL oncogenes.Cell. 1992; 70: 901-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 6Abraham S.A. Hopcroft L.E. Carrick E. Drotar M.E.

Li Y. Felsher D.W. MYC activation is a hallmark of cancer initiation and maintenance.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4a014241Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Populations of self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs) generate the bulk of leukemic cells (8Bonnet D. Dick J.E. Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (5089) Google Scholar). LSCs are relatively resistant to chemotherapy and persist as a potential source of relapse, and drugs that eradicate LSCs may provide durable remission. LSCs do not require BCR–Abl activity and are therefore resistant to imatinib (9Corbin A.S. Agarwal A. Loriaux M. Cortes J. Deininger M.W. Druker B.J. Human chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells are insensitive to imatinib despite inhibition of BCR-ABL activity.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 396-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). However, they are highly reliant on both c-Myc and p53, and dual targeting of both c-Myc and p53 has been shown to selectively and synergistically eliminate LSCs (6Abraham S.A. Hopcroft L.E. Carrick E. Drotar M.E. Dunn K. Williamson A.J. Korfi K. Baquero P. Park L.E. Scott M.T. Pellicano F. Pierce A. Copland M. Nourse C. Grimmond S.M. et al.Dual targeting of p53 and c-MYC selectively eliminates leukaemic stem cells.Nature. 2016; 534: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), demonstrating a need for novel compounds that simultaneously inhibit c-Myc and activate p53. LSCs compete with healthy hematopoietic stem cells for the bone marrow niche, which constitutes a functional vulnerability of primitive leukemia cells (10Schepers K. Campbell T.B. Passegue E. Normal and leukemic stem cell niches: insights and therapeutic opportunities.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 254-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, cell competition is not typically assayed in high-throughput drug screens, and drugs that reduce the competitiveness of cancer cells without directly affecting cell viability are likely to be discarded. We reasoned that a straightforward cell competition assay, in which healthy cells and isogenic oncogene-expressing cells compete against each other, would efficiently identify novel compounds that selectively target oncogene-transformed cells. We identified several compounds that preferentially inhibit BCR–Abl-transformed cells, including a compound with anti-LSC activity that dually targets c-Myc/p53. To identify novel compounds that target BCR–Abl-driven leukemias, we developed an isogenic cell competition–based drug screen by stably transfecting Ba/F3 cells with BCR–Abl. Transfection of Ba/F3 cells with BCR–Abl transformed the cells and resulted in interleukin-3 (IL3)–independent growth (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous reports (11Asmussen J. Lasater E.A. Tajon C. Oses-Prieto J. Jun Y.-W. Taylor B.S. Burlingame A. Craik C.S. Shah N.P. MEK-dependent negative feedback underlies BCR–ABL-mediated oncogene addiction.Cancer Discov. 2014; 4: 200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Modi H. McDonald T. Chu S. Yee J.-K. Forman S.J. Bhatia R. Role of BCR/ABL gene-expression levels in determining the phenotype and imatinib sensitivity of transformed human hematopoietic cells.Blood. 2007; 109: 5411-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), BCR–Abl-transformed cells were significantly more sensitive to imatinib than WT cells, demonstrating they had become oncogene addicted (Fig. 1A). Next, BCR–Abl-expressing cells were stably transfected with enhanced GFP and WT cells with mCherry. These cells were mixed and treated with imatinib for 72 h (all experiments involving WT cells were performed in the presence of IL3 unless stated otherwise), after which the BCR–Abl:WT cell ratio was measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). Imatinib conferred a competitive disadvantage on BCR–Abl cells (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the competition assay was significantly more sensitive than the commonly used CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay (Fig. 1D). Using the competition assay, we screened 17,962 compounds for selective inhibition of BCR–Abl-expressing cells (Fig. 1E). Most compounds had little or no impact on the BCR–Abl:WT cell ratio (Fig. 1F). We selected 203 compounds that fell outside the 3σ interval (Fig. 1G). These compounds were retested three times, resulting in 87 drugs that significantly (p < 0.05) altered the BCR–Abl:WT cell ratio (Fig. 1H). This included imatinib, thus validating the screen. All 87 compounds were subjected to dose–response tests with freshly prepared drug stocks using competition assays and viability assays. We found that some compounds did not replicate the effect of the original library compounds (gray bars in Fig. 1H). This may have been because of errors during preparation of the original library, contaminants in the initial screen, or compound degradation products. Nonreproducible compounds and compounds that were excessively expensive to synthesize were discarded, leaving a total of 13 compounds that either increased (four compounds, although high doses induced general toxicity; Fig. S1A) or decreased (eight compounds; Fig. 2) the competitiveness of BCR–Abl-expressing cells. Among the four compounds that promoted relative competitiveness of BCR–Abl cells was the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor AZD1480 (Fig. S1A). Structurally unrelated JAK2 inhibitors had the same effect (Fig. S1B), whereas cotreatment with imatinib restored the dependency of BCR–Abl-expressing cells to JAK2 (Fig. S1C), consistent with previous studies (13Hantschel O. Warsch W. Eckelhart E. Kaupe I. Grebien F. Wagner K.U. Superti-Furga G. Sexl V. BCR-ABL uncouples canonical JAK2-STAT5 signaling in chronic myeloid leukemia.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors lapatinib and gefitinib and the G protein–coupled receptor inhibitor octoclothepin also promoted the competitiveness of BCR–Abl cells (Fig. S1A), although the reasons for this are currently unclear. Ba/F3 cells do not normally express EGFR, suggesting an off-target effect of EGFR inhibitors, e.g., by inhibiting JAK kinases (14Boehrer S. Ades L. Braun T. Galluzzi L. Grosjean J. Fabre C. Le Roux G. Gardin C. Martin A. de Botton S. Fenaux P. Kroemer G. Erlotinib exhibits antineoplastic off-target effects in AML and MDS: a preclinical study.Blood. 2008; 111: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Octoclothepine inhibits G protein–coupled receptors that elevate intracellular cAMP levels (15Bogeso K.P. Liljefors T. Arnt J. Hyttel J. Pedersen H. Octoclothepin enantiomers.

Chem. 1991; 34: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and cAMP impairs survival of BCR–Abl-expressing cells (see later). We identified eight compounds that reduced the competitiveness of BCR–Abl cells, including sobuzoxane (topoisomerase II inhibitor) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (Fig. 2). Their effect was validated by unrelated inhibitors (Fig. S2, A–E). Phosphodiesterase inhibitors increase cellular cAMP levels, which decrease the growth rate of multiple tumor cell types by activating protein kinase A (PKA) (16Fajardo A.M. Piazza G.A. Tinsley H.N. The role of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways in cancer: targets for prevention and treatment.Cancers (Basel). 2014; 6: 436-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The cAMP synthesis–activating agent forskolin (16Fajardo A.M. Piazza G.A. Tinsley H.N. The role of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways in cancer: targets for prevention and treatment.Cancers (Basel). 2014; 6: 436-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) also inhibited BCR–Abl cells, whereas the inactive forskolin analog dideoxyforskolin had no effect (Fig. S2, F–G). Similar results were obtained with the PKA agonist 8Br-cAMP, but not with a cAMP analog that cannot activate PKA (17Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. A novel Epac-specific cAMP analogue demonstrates independent regulation of Rap1 and ERK.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2, H–I). These data demonstrate that drugs that increase cAMP levels selectively inhibit BCR–Abl-expressing cells. Six uncharacterized compounds selectively inhibited BCR–Abl-expressing cells (DJ1, DJ2, DJ3, DJ12, DJ34, and DJ35; Fig. 2), but they did not directly target BCR–Abl (Fig. S3). Several of these compounds also inhibited the human CML cell lines MEG-01, KU-812, and K562, as well as the human Ph+ ALL cell line SD-1, which was not effectively killed by imatinib (Fig. S4), indicating that these compounds may serve as a starting point for development of alternative forms of therapy for both CML and Ph+ ALL patients. We analyzed the drug-like properties of the novel compounds using SwissADME (18Daina A. Michielin O. Zoete V. SwissADME: a free web tool to evaluate pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness and medicinal chemistry friendliness of small molecules.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 42717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar) and found that DJ2, DJ12, and DJ35 have unfavorable drug-like properties, whereas DJ1 and DJ3 contain an alkyne group and a nitrile group, respectively, which can be unstable and chemically reactive in vivo. DJ34 was predicted to have excellent drug-like properties (Table S2, tab 1), which was confirmed by initial ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion)–pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses (Table S2, tab 2–6). We confirmed that freshly synthesized DJ34 targeted BCR–Abl-transformed Ba/F3 cells more efficiently than the isogenic parental cells (Fig. 3A). DJ34 also killed primary cancer cells derived from a Ph+ ALL patient more efficiently and at lower doses than imatinib (Fig. 3B). Importantly, blast cells derived from patients with ALL and mixed B-ALL/acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) were more sensitive to DJ34 than healthy bone marrow cells (Fig. 3C). Although analysis of a larger cohort of patients and healthy donors is required, these data suggest the existence of a potential therapeutic window. To better understand how DJ34 may inhibit cancer cells, we first performed phosphoflow cytometry experiments to investigate its effect on a panel of oncogenic signaling pathways. DJ34 had no effect on any of the examined phosphoproteins (Fig. S5A). Phosphorylation of S473 of AKT and Y694 of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5, both of which depend on BCR–Abl signaling, were also not affected by DJ34 (Fig. S5B), consistent with our observations that DJ34 does not directly inhibit BCR–Abl (Fig. S3). This shows that DJ34 does not affect several canonical oncogenic pathways. We then decided to apply a broader unbiased approach to determine how DJ34 may affect cells using a combination of RNA-Seq and MS-based phosphoproteomics for multiparameter analysis of the cellular programs altered by DJ34 (Fig. 4A). RNA-Seq analysis identified 1206 and 1705 gene transcripts that were at least twofold decreased or increased in abundance by DJ34 treatment, respectively (Table S3). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that c-Myc–dependent genes were significantly enriched in the RNA-Seq data set as well as genes associated with the p53 pathway (Fig. 4B). Closer inspection confirmed that DJ34 downregulated genes, such as EIF4, CD47, CDC2, CCND2, and RCC1, which are activated by c-Myc (e.g., (19Zeller K.I. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. O'Donnell K.A. Dang C.V. An integrated database of genes responsive to the Myc oncogenic transcription factor: identification of direct genomic targets.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Fig. 4C). Conversely, treatment with DJ34 promoted the expression of genes that are inhibited by c-Myc, such as NDRG1, CDKN1A, and GADD45 ((19Zeller K.I. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. O'Donnell K.A. Dang C.V.

A. 2003; 100: 8164-8169Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar); Fig. 4C). Similar findings were obtained by RT–quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of several c-Myc target genes (Fig. 4D). Gene Ontology analysis of the genes upregulated by DJ34 revealed a significant enrichment of terms associated with reduced c-Myc function and/or increased p53 signaling, such as mitotic cell cycle, positive regulation of programmed cell death, and positive regulation of cell differentiation (Fig. S6A). Phosphoproteomic analysis of cells treated with imatinib or DJ34 indicated that these compounds have distinct effects on cellular signaling pathways. We identified a similar number of unique phosphopeptides from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-, imatinib-, and DJ34-treated cells (Fig. S6B). Imatinib decreased the abundance of several tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, including sites previously associated with BCR–Abl signaling (thus validating our approach; Fig. 4E and Table S4), whereas tyrosine phosphosites did not appear to be affected by DJ34 treatment (Table S5). Instead, a high proportion of the phosphosites reduced by DJ34 were proline-directed phosphosites (Fig. 4F), including the residues Thr58 and Ser62 on c-Myc (Fig. 4G), consistent with our RNA-Seq data indicating that DJ34 inhibits c-Myc activity (Fig. 4, B–D). Validation of RNA-Seq and MS data by immunoblotting confirmed that not only phosphorylation of c-Myc Thr58 and Ser62 was decreased by DJ34 but also showed that total c-Myc protein levels were strongly reduced (Fig. 4H; total c-Myc levels were not detected by MS, most likely because it is a low-abundance protein that could only be detected after enrichment of phosphorylated peptides). Furthermore, p53 was undetectable in the lysates of DMSO-treated cells, whereas DJ34 treatment increased total p53 levels as well as Ser15-phosphorylated p53 (a marker of active p53; Fig. 4H). Together, these data indicate that DJ34 simultaneously inhibits c-Myc and activates p53. A compound that both inhibits c-Myc while stabilizing p53 could provide a valuable therapeutic agent not only for leukemia but also for a wide range of cancers (6Abraham S.A. Hopcroft L.E. Carrick E.

We found that DJ34 treatment resulted in c-Myc depletion in all cancer cell lines tested, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 5). DJ34 treatment depleted c-Myc in primary human AML blasts as well (Fig. 5), showing that the anti-c-Myc effect of DJ34 is not restricted to laboratory cell lines. Furthermore, DJ34 treatment increased p53 levels for almost all cancer cell lines that exhibited low p53 levels under control conditions (Fig. 5). This included the lung cancer cell lines A-549 and H-460, the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and the glioblastoma cell line U-87, all of which express WT p53 (24Bouaoun L. Sonkin D. Ardin M.

The same was observed for the leukemia cell line SD-1 (unknown p53 status), whereas p53 was undetectable in the p53-mutant CML cell line K562 (25Law J.C. Ritke M.K. Yalowich J.C. Leder G.H.

Together, these data show that DJ34 treatment broadly inhibits c-Myc levels while at the same time activating p53. We wished to better understand the cellular requirements for the DJ34-induced reduction in c-Myc. The proteasomal inhibitor MG132 prevented DJ34-induced c-Myc depletion (Fig. S7A), suggesting that DJ34 treatment leads to proteasomal depletion of c-Myc. In many cancers, proteasomal degradation of c-Myc is prevented by increased phosphorylation of Ser62. This can occur via either hyperactive proline-directed kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases or inactivation of the phosphatase PP2A (28Farrell A.S. Sears R.C. MYC degradation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4a014365Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). DJ34 primarily downregulated proline-directed phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4F), so we assessed whether DJ34 induces proteasomal depletion of c-Myc via regulating its phosphorylation status. In vitro kinase analysis using the KINOMEscan platform (www.discoverx.com) revealed that DJ34 had moderate or no effect on the activity of 55 kinases (Table S6), including the bona fide c-Myc kinases ERK and Cdk2. In addition, pretreatment with the potent PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid did not prevent DJ34-induced depletion of c-Myc (Fig. S7B; phosphorylation of the direct PP2A target Akt is shown as control (29Kuo Y.C. Huang K.Y. Yang C.H. Yang Y.S. Lee W.Y. Chiang C.W. Regulation of phosphorylation of Thr-308 of Akt, cell proliferation, and survival by the B55alpha regulatory subunit targeting of the protein phosphatase 2A holoenzyme to Akt.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1882-1892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)). These data indicate that DJ34 does not cause c-Myc depletion by targeting kinases or phosphatases known to regulate c-Myc proteasomal degradation. We next tested the effect of DJ34 on other proteins known to regulate c-Myc proteasomal degradation. Certain Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) complexes can ubiquitinate c-Myc to target it for destruction (28Farrell A.S. Sears R.C. MYC degradation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4a014365Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). SCF activity requires prior neddylation of the Cullin RING ligase subunit by the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 (30Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S. A new NEDD8-ligating system for cullin-4A.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2263-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). SCF activity can be efficiently inhibited by the small-molecule inhibitor MLN4924, which targets the E1 Nedd8-activating enzyme (31Soucy T.A. Smith P.G. Milhollen M.A. Berger A.J. Gavin J.M. Adhikari S. Brownell J.E. Burke K.E. Cardin D.P. Critchley S. Cullis C.A. Doucette A. Garnsey J.J. Gaulin J.L. Gershman R.E. et al.An inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme as a new approach to treat cancer.Nature. 2009; 458: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). While pretreatment of cells with MLN4924 considerably increased c-Myc levels, DJ34 treatment still resulted in depletion of a large proportion of c-Myc (Fig. S7C). Treatment with DJ34 also induced strong c-Myc depletion in FBXW7−/− cells (Fig. S7D), which lack F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7), which is a critical component of the main SCF responsible for c-Myc degradation (32Akhoondi S. Sun D. von der Lehr N. Apostolidou S. Klotz K. Maljukova A. Cepeda D. Fiegl H. Dafou D. Marth C. Mueller-Holzner E. Corcoran M. Dagnell M. Nejad S.Z. Nayer B.N. et al.FBXW7/hCDC4 is a general tumor suppressor in human cancer.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9006-9012Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). We did observe that the rate of c-Myc depletion was slower in FBXW7−/− cells than in WT cells (see graph in Fig. S7D), suggesting that part of the c-Myc pool might be degraded by FBW7 on DJ34 treatment. Alternatively, it is possible that in FBXW7−/− cells, the c-Myc degradation machinery is saturated because of the high levels of basal c-Myc, resulting in an apparent reduction in the rate of DJ34-induced c-Myc depletion. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, the levels of the FBW7 target cyclin E (33Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of cyclin E by the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase.Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) were not affected by DJ34 (Fig. S7E), arguing against the possibility that DJ34 directly activates the SCFFBW7 complex to degrade c-Myc. Next, we focused on CHIP (also known as STIP1 homology and U-Box containing protein 1), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates c-Myc depletion independently of the phosphorylation status of c-Myc. Strikingly, even after 6 h of DJ34 treatment, CHIP−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts still had not succeeded in degrading c-Myc (Fig. S7F), showing that an intact CHIP pathway is required for depletion of c-Myc by DJ34. To further delineate the process of c-Myc depletion, we combined DJ34 with the ribosome inhibitor cycloheximide and monitored c-Myc protein levels over time. Interestingly, DJ34 did not appear to accelerate cycloheximide-induced depletion of c-Myc (Fig. S7G), suggesting that DJ34 primarily acts upstream of the ribosome. We used qPCR to determine whether DJ34 has a pretranslational effect on c-Myc, which revealed a significant reduction in c-MYC mRNA levels on DJ34 treatment in all cell lines tested, including K562, MV4-11, HCT-116, and MIA–PaCa cells (Fig. 6A). These data suggest that DJ34 inhibits transcription of c-MYC. The reduction in c-MYC mRNA levels by DJ34 could be due to altered mRNA stability rather than inhibition of transcription. To distinguish between these possibilities, we blocked transcription with the strong RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin (34Kaplan C.D. Larsson K.M. Kornberg R.D. The RNA polymerase II trigger loop functions in substrate selection and is directly targeted by alpha-amanitin.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if DJ34 destabilizes mRNA, combining DJ34 with α-amanitin should result in more rapid loss of c-Myc, whereas there should be no added effect if DJ34 impedes c-MYC transcription, because mRNA synthesis is already fully blocked by α-amanitin. While treatment with α-amanitin resulted in efficient removal of c-Myc, α-amanitin did not appear to potentiate DJ34-induced loss of c-Myc (Fig. S7H), indicating that DJ34 and α-amanitin target the same process, i.e., c-MYC transcription. We reasoned that DJ34 might i"
https://openalex.org/W3113368708,"Background Poor patient experiences during delivery in Uttar Pradesh, India is a common problem. It delays presentation at facilities after the onset of labor and contributes to poor maternal health outcomes. Patient-centered maternity care (PCMC) is recognized by the World Health Organization as critical to overall quality. Changing PCMC requires changing the process of care, and is therefore especially challenging. Methods We used a matched case-control design to evaluate a quality improvement process directed at PCMC and based on widely established team-based methods used in many OECD countries. The intervention was introduced into three government facilities and teams supported to brainstorm and test improvements over 12 months. Progress was measured through pre-post interviews with new mothers, scored using a validated PCMC scale. Analysis included chi-squared and difference-in-difference tests. Findings On a scale to 100, the PCMC score of the intervention group increased 22.9 points compared to controls. Deliveries attended by midwives, dais, ASHAs or non-skilled providers resulted in significantly higher PCMC scores than those attended to by nurses or doctors. The intervention was associated with one additional visit from a doctor and over two additional visits from nurses per day, compared to the control group. Interpretation This study has demonstrated the effectiveness of a team-based quality improvement intervention to ameliorate women’s childbirth experiences. These improvements were locally designed and led, and offer a model for potential replication."
https://openalex.org/W2984996015,"Autism susceptibility candidate 2 ( AUTS2 ) is a neurodevelopmental regulator associated with an autosomal dominant intellectual disability syndrome, AUTS2 syndrome, and is implicated as an important gene in human-specific evolution. AUTS2 exists as part of a tripartite gene family, the AUTS2 family, which includes two relatively undefined proteins, Fibrosin (FBRS) and Fibrosin-like protein 1 (FBRSL1). Evolutionary ancestors of AUTS2 have not been formally identified outside of the Animalia clade. A Drosophila melanogaster protein, Tay bridge, with a role in neurodevelopment, has been shown to display limited similarity to the C-terminal of AUTS2, suggesting that evolutionary ancestors of the AUTS2 family may exist within other Protostome lineages. Here we present an evolutionary analysis of the AUTS2 family, which highlights ancestral homologs of AUTS2 in multiple Protostome species, implicates AUTS2 as the closest human relative to the progenitor of the AUTS2 family, and demonstrates that Tay bridge is a divergent ortholog of the ancestral AUTS2 progenitor gene. We also define regions of high relative sequence identity, with potential functional significance, shared by the extended AUTS2 protein family. Using structural predictions coupled with sequence conservation and human variant data from 15,708 individuals, a putative domain structure for AUTS2 was produced that can be used to aid interpretation of the consequences of nucleotide variation on protein structure and function in human disease. To assess the role of AUTS2 in human-specific evolution, we recalculated allele frequencies at previously identified human derived sites using large population genome data, and show a high prevalence of ancestral alleles, suggesting that AUTS2 may not be a rapidly evolving gene, as previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W3111698827,"Background Previous studies established an association between laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (LCI) and hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but not causality. We aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms by adding biological mediators to an established study design used by earlier studies. Methods With data on biomarkers, we used a self-controlled case-series design to evaluate the effect of LCI on hospitalization for AMI among Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients. We included senior Veterans (age 65 years and older) with LCI between 2010 through 2015. Patient-level data from VHA electronic medical records were used to capture laboratory results, hospitalizations, and baseline patient characteristics. We defined the “risk interval” as the first 7 days after specimen collection and the “control interval” as 1 year before and 1 year after the risk interval. More importantly, using mediation analysis, we examined the role of abnormal white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count in the relationship between LCI and AMI to explore the thrombogenic nature of this association, thus potential causality. Results We identified 391 hospitalizations for AMI that occurred within +/-1 year of a positive influenza test, of which 31 (31.1 admissions/week) occurred during the risk interval and 360 (3.5/per week) during the control interval, resulting in an incidence ratio (IR) for AMI admission of 8.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.16–12.84). In stratified analyses, AMI risk was significantly elevated among patients with high WBC count (IR, 12.43; 95% CI: 6.99–22.10) and high platelet count (IR, 15.89; 95% CI: 3.59–70.41). Conclusion We confirmed a significant association between LCI and AMI. The risk was elevated among those with high WBC or platelet count, suggesting a potential role for inflammation and platelet activation in the underlying mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3112998828,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed tumor in women worldwide. Although the combination of surgery and Taxol chemotherapy can achieve a certain therapeutic effect, patients often develop drug-resistance, resulting in a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is significative to seek the molecular mechanism of chemotherapy resistance. Recent studies have found that abnormal epigenetic regulation in breast cells changes the expression of key genes, which can lead to the occurrence, development, and maintenance of cancer, even related to the development of drug-resistance. Therefore, in this study, we performed methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) to reveal the difference in methylation between breast cancer drug-resistant cells and sensitive cells. A total of 55076 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were detected, including 21061 hypermethylated DMGs and 34015 hypomethylated DMGs. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis reveal the function and pathway of screening genes. These results indicate that DNA methylation may be involved in regulating the occurrence and development of breast cancer."

Design Prospective Randomised Interventional Study. Setting Renal Transplant Department in a tertiary centre in the United Kingdom. Participants 200 Renal transplant patients aged between 20 and 88 years. Telephone interviews were undertaken between 1 st May, 2020 and 29 th May, 2020, at the height of ‘shielding’ from COVID-19. Interventions Participants were randomised into 2 groups, with 1 group receiving a simple ‘priming question’ regarding the COVID pandemic and the other group having no prior contact. Main outcome measurements Individuals were then asked to rate their own overall lifetime happiness; desire to change; overall life satisfaction and momentary happiness on a scale of 1 to 10 for each measure. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare results between the two groups, with a type 1 error rate below 5% considered statistically significant. Results Participants’ overall happiness with their life as a whole revealed that individuals who were primed with a question about COVID-19 reported increased overall happiness with their life compared to individuals who had not been primed (+0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 1.35, p = 0.0002). In addition, participants in the primed group reported less desire to change their life when compared to the non-primed group (-1.35, 95% confidence interval -2.06 to -0.65, p = 0.0002). Participants who were primed with the COVID-19 question also reported a higher overall satisfaction with their life than individuals who had not been primed (+1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.52, p = 0.0001). Finally, the participants who received the priming question demonstrated increased reported momentary happiness (+0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.24, p = 0.04). Conclusions The results demonstrated that bringing salience to the COVID-19 pandemic with a simple question leads to positive changes in both momentary happiness and other components of global life satisfaction, thereby extrapolating evidence for the application of the mood-as-information theory to more extreme life circumstances. Given the importance of patient-reported evaluations, these findings have implications for how, when and where accurate and reproducible measurements of life satisfaction should be obtained."

https://openalex.org/W3111682551,"Increasing evidence emphasizes the importance of chemokines and chemokine receptors as regulators of bone remodeling. The C–C chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) is dramatically upregulated during osteoclastogenesis, but the role of CCR3 in osteoclast formation and bone remodeling in adult mice is unknown. Herein, we used bone marrow macrophages derived from adult male CCR3-proficient and CCR3-deficient mice to study the role of CCR3 in osteoclast formation and activity. CCR3 deficiency was associated with formation of giant hypernucleated osteoclasts, enhanced bone resorption when cultured on bone slices, and altered mRNA expression of related chemokine receptors and ligands. In addition, primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts isolated from CCR3-deficient mice showed increased mRNA expression of the osteoclast activator–related gene, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, and osteoblast differentiation–associated genes. Microcomputed tomography analyses of femurs from CCR3-deficient mice revealed a bone phenotype that entailed less cortical thickness and volume. Consistent with our in vitro studies, the total number of osteoclasts did not differ between the genotypes in vivo. Moreover, an increased endocortical osteoid mineralization rate and higher trabecular and cortical bone formation rate was displayed in CCR3-deficient mice.

During physiological bone remodeling, the actions of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts cooperate in order to successively rebuild the skeleton, a highly balanced process that is crucial to preserve normal skeletal functions and to maintain bone mass. Osteoblasts and osteocytes express receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), the key protein that promotes differentiation of cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage into mature osteoclasts with bone resorptive capacity. In addition to hormones and mechanical loading, molecules that are primarily associated with the immune system, e.g., cytokines and chemokines, regulate the level of available RANKL and thus also control the bone remodeling process (1Souza P.P. Lerner U.H. The role of cytokines in inflammatory bone loss.Immunol. Invest. 2013; 42: 555-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Inflammation may disturb the prevailing equilibrium between bone formation and bone resorption, which most often manifest as a net bone loss because of excessive formation and activity of osteoclasts. Pathological bone loss is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontitis, and loosened joint prosthesis and tooth implants (1Souza P.P. Lerner U.H. The role of cytokines in inflammatory bone loss.Immunol. Invest. 2013; 42: 555-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Chemokines are key regulators of the innate and adaptive immune system. They are released by a wide variety of cell types in response to infection or tissue damage and form chemotactic gradients that attract leukocytes to sites of inflammation, which further facilitate the immune response by mediating angiogenesis (2Mackay C.R. Chemokines: immunology's high impact factors.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Besides the involvement of chemokines during pathological conditions, chemokines are also involved in homing of immune cells to lymph nodes during homeostasis. The mode of action relies on interaction between chemokines and their cognate receptors, a system that is highly complex as there are approximately 50 chemokine ligands and 20 chemokine receptors known to date (3Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. The chemokine superfamily revisited.Immunity. 2012; 36: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Hence, multiple ligands share the same receptor. Although the crossreactivity is comprehensive, most chemokines have a preferred high-affinity receptor (4Rajagopalan L. Rajarathnam K. Structural basis of chemokine receptor function--a model for binding affinity and ligand selectivity.Biosci. Rep. 2006; 26: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence shows that chemokine signaling promotes crosstalk between the cells of the immune system and bone cells and thus plays a crucial role in the bone remodeling process during physiological and pathological conditions (5Brylka L.J. Schinke T. Chemokines in physiological and pathological bone remodeling.Front. Immunol. 2019; 10: 2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that individuals with periodontitis, a condition that entails jawbone loss triggered by chronic inflammation in the gum, present with systemically and locally higher levels of the C–C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) (6Bostrom E.A. Kindstedt E. Sulniute R. Palmqvist P. Majster M. Holm C.K. Zwicker S. Clark R. Onell S. Johansson I. Lerner U.H. Lundberg P.

Further experimental studies revealed that CCL11 is highly expressed by osteoblasts during inflammation-induced bone resorption (7Kindstedt E. Holm C.K. Sulniute R. Martinez-Carrasco I. Lundmark R. Lundberg P. CCL11, a novel mediator of inflammatory bone resorption.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In line with our findings, others have shown high CCL11 levels in conditions that are characterized by pathological bone loss, e.g., RA (8Kokkonen H. Soderstrom I. Rocklov J. Hallmans G. Lejon K. Rantapaa Dahlqvist S. Up-regulation of cytokines and chemokines predates the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.Arthritis Rheum. 2010; 62: 383-391PubMed Google Scholar), osteoarthritis (9Hsu Y.H.

CCL11 binds to the chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5, with highest affinity to CCR3 (11Kitaura M. Nakajima T. Imai T. Harada S. Combadiere C. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. Yoshie O.

The importance of CCR2 and CCR5 signaling in the continuous balancing of bone mass and during osteoclastogenesis has been demonstrated in chemokine and chemokine receptor deficiency in vivo models. Mice lacking either the receptor CCR2 or its primary ligand CCL2 display a reduction in osteoclast numbers and size, resulting in decreased bone resorption and severe osteopetrosis (13Binder N.B.

Saitou T. Uehara S. Kobayashi Y. Ueha S. Matsushima K. Yamaguchi A. Imai Y. Iimura T. The HIV co-receptor CCR5 regulates osteoclast function.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate essential roles for CCR2, CCR5, and their associated ligands in bone-destructive conditions through the influence on osteoclast function. Despite the fact that CCR3 expression is highly upregulated during osteoclastogenesis, the importance of CCR3 signaling in normal bone remodeling and pathological conditions affecting the bone remains largely unknown. CCR3 can bind several ligands, of which CCL7 stimulates osteoclast differentiation in vitro (16Hayashi Y. Okamatsu Y. Usui M. Yamamoto M. CCL7 and CCL25 promote RANKL-induced osteoclast formation.J. Jpn. Soc. Periodontol. 2009; 51: 51-61Crossref Google Scholar) and CCL5 (also known as regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, RANTES) is chemotactic for osteoblasts and has an inhibitory effect on osteoclasts (17Yano S.

Interestingly, its most high-affinity ligand CCL11 is reported to increase preosteoclast migration and osteoclastic bone resorption (7Kindstedt E. Holm C.K. Sulniute R. Martinez-Carrasco I.

Herein, we study the effect of CCR3 deficiency on osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption, and osteoblast gene expression in vitro. Furthermore, we analyze the bone phenotype of CCR3-deficient adult male mice. To study if CCR3 deficiency affects osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast morphology, we cultured primary bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from Ccr3−/− and Ccr3+/+ mice in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and RANKL. The osteoclasts formed after 48 h tended to be larger in size in the Ccr3−/− than in the Ccr3+/+ cultures. This size difference was even more pronounced after 60 and 66 h of culture. After 72 h, Ccr3−/− osteoclasts were highly oversized (Fig. 1A), which also could be verified quantitatively as the number of large osteoclasts (>10,000 μm2) was significantly higher in the Ccr3−/− osteoclast cultures (1.4-fold to 9-fold; Fig. 1B). Importantly, the Ccr3+/+ osteoclasts did never reach the same giant size as Ccr3−/− osteoclasts, even though the culture time was extended (96 h; Fig. S1). Moreover, the number of nuclei per osteoclast was higher in Ccr3−/− osteoclast cultures (Fig. 1C). However, the total number of osteoclasts did not differ between the genotypes after 48 h or after 72 h of culture (Fig. 1B shows number of osteoclasts at 72 h). To analyze if even heterozygous osteoclasts present with an increase in cell size, osteoclasts derived from BMMs were cultured from Ccr3−/−, Ccr3+/−, and Ccr3+/+ mice. The results show that oversized osteoclasts could be seen also in the Ccr3+/− cultures, although not as marked as in cells from the homozygous phenotype (Fig. S1). To explore if CCR3 deficiency also affects osteoclast formation and morphology when cultured on a physiological substrate, and to investigate if the bone-resorbing capacity is affected, BMMs derived from Ccr3−/− and Ccr3+/+ mice were cultured on bone slices. Similar to the results from BMM cultures on plastic, the Ccr3−/− derived osteoclasts on bone slices were larger in size compared with the Ccr3+/+ derived cells, and the size difference visually increased over time (Fig. 2A). The amount of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) secreted into cell culture supernatants between days 3 and 5 was significantly higher in cultures of Ccr3−/− osteoclasts compared with cultures of Ccr3+/+ osteoclasts (Fig. 2B). The release of C-terminal type I collagen (CTX-I, a marker of bone resorption) was significantly higher in cultures of Ccr3−/− osteoclasts compared with cultures of Ccr3+/+ osteoclasts between days 5 to 7 and days 7 to 9 (Fig. 2C). Thus, osteoclasts lacking CCR3 show increased size and number of nuclei per osteoclast, higher TRAP5b release, and, when cultured on bone, an enhanced bone resorption capacity. To investigate whether the different osteoclast morphology, seen in the absence of CCR3, is related to altered expression of established osteoclastogenic and osteoclastic genes, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses in Ccr3−/− and Ccr3+/+ BMM cultures supplemented with M-CSF or M-CSF and RANKL. RANKL upregulated all analyzed osteoclastogenic and osteoclastic genes downstream RANK in both genotypes (data not shown). However, no significant differences in mRNA levels of the pivotal osteoclastogenic transcription factors (Finkel–Biskis–Jinkins osteosarcoma oncogene [c-Fos] and nuclear factor–activated T cells c1 [Nfatc1]), the osteoclastogenic genes (receptor activator of nuclear factor–κB [Rank], Fc receptor γ subunit [Fcer1g], osteoclast-associated receptor [Oscar], alpha v beta 3 integrin [Itgav], DNAX adaptor protein 12 [DAP12]), and the osteoclastic genes (Trap/Acp5, cathepsin K [Ctsk], matrix metallopeptidase 9 [Mmp9], chloride channel 7 [Clcn7], calcitonin receptor [Calcr], dentrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein [Dcstamp] or ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal V0 subunit D2 [ATP6v0d2]) were detected between the Ccr3−/− and Ccr3+/+ cells (Table S2). Because the CCR3-related receptors CCR2 and CCR5 are both known to be important for osteoclast fusion and function, we also analyzed the mRNA expression levels of Ccr2 and Ccr5 and their high-affinity ligands Ccl2 and Ccl5. In the BMM cultures supplemented with M-CSF, we observed significantly higher levels of Ccr2, Ccl2, and Ccr5 mRNAs in Ccr3−/− than in Ccr3+/+ cells, and this difference was apparent up to 48 h (Ccr2 and Ccl2) and 72 h (Ccr5) after seeding (Fig. 3, A–C). Moreover, the Ccl5 expression levels were lower in the Ccr3−/− cells under these conditions (Fig. 3D). Although the addition of RANKL led to downregulation of the Ccr2, Ccl2, and Ccr5 mRNAs in both Ccr3+/+ and Ccr3−/− cells, the abundance of these mRNAs remained higher in the Ccr3−/− cells (Fig. 3, A–C). RANKL caused upregulation of Ccl5 in both Ccr3+/+ and Ccr3−/− cells (Fig. 3D), although the expression levels were lower in the Ccr3−/− cells. As expected, the expression of Ccr3 was upregulated by the RANKL stimulation in the Ccr3+/+ cells (data not shown). Taken together, CCR3 deficiency does not change the expression of osteoclast-associated genes in response to RANKL but coincides with a higher expression of Ccr2, Ccr5, and Ccl2 and lower expression of Ccl5. Because Ccr3−/− preosteoclasts and osteoclasts show lower Ccl5 and higher Ccr5 mRNA abundance than the corresponding Ccr3+/+ cells, we investigated if addition of recombinant CCL5 could influence the osteoclast in vitro phenotype. BMMs derived from Ccr3+/+ and Ccr3−/− mice were cultured for 72 h, supplemented with M-CSF and RANKL, in the presence and absence of CCL5. As in previous osteoclast cell culture experiments, Ccr3−/− osteoclasts became very large in size (Fig. 4A). Addition of CCL5 clearly inhibited the formation of hypernucleated giant osteoclasts in Ccr3−/− cultures (Fig. 4B) and also reduced the osteoclast size in Ccr3+/+ cultures (Fig. 4, C–D). To determine if CCR3 deficiency affects bone parameters in vivo, microcomputed tomography (μCT) analyses were performed on dissected femurs of Ccr3+/+ and Ccr3−/− mice. Trabecular and cortical bone parameters were measured at metaphysis and diaphysis, respectively. Even though the femur length did not differ between the two genotypes (average 16.29 mm in Ccr3+/+ and 16.09 mm in Ccr3−/−), μCT data analyses revealed that the total tissue volume, the volume inside the periosteum, was significantly higher at the metaphysis in Ccr3−/− femurs (Fig. 5A), whereas it was equal for both genotypes at the diaphysis (Fig. 5B). The medullary volume, the volume between endosteum, was significantly higher in Ccr3−/− mice at the metaphysis (Fig. 5C) and the diaphysis (Fig. 5D) compared with Ccr3+/+ mice. Further analyses of μCT data demonstrated that there was no difference in trabecular bone volume between the genotypes (Fig. 5E), and the cortical bone volume was significantly lower in Ccr3−/− mice (Fig. 5F). Likewise, no difference in trabecular thickness could be observed in Ccr3−/− compared with Ccr3+/+ mice, but the cortical thickness was significantly lower in Ccr3−/− mice (Fig. 5, G–H, respectively). The trabecular number and pattern in Ccr3−/− mice were not altered in comparison with Ccr3+/+ mice, although the trabecular separation was significantly higher in Ccr3−/− mice (Fig. S3, A–C). This positively correlates to the larger marrow space and metaphyseal tissue volume. Dynamic histomorphometry was performed to evaluate the mineral apposition rate (MAR), mineralizing surface (MS), and bone formation rate (BFR) in nondecalcified bone sections from Ccr3+/+ and Ccr3−/− femurs. The trabecular MAR was not significantly affected by the lack of CCR3 (Fig. 6A), whereas the cortical MAR was 35% higher in Ccr3−/− mice (Fig. 6B). The augmented MAR was particularly found in the endosteal compartment with an increase of 56% in Ccr3−/− mice compared with Ccr3+/+ mice (Fig. 6C). The periosteal MAR did not differ between the genotypes (Fig. 6D). Images of fluorescently labeled Ccr3+/+ and Ccr3−/− distal femur bone sections show the larger interlabel distance and thicker fluorescent bone labels on the endosteal side of the cortical bone in the Ccr3−/− section (Fig. 6E). No difference in trabecular or cortical MS could be seen between the genotypes, whereas the trabecular and cortical BFR was significantly increased by 43% and 32%, respectively, in Ccr3−/− mice (Fig. 7, A–D). To further elucidate if the cortical bone phenotype in Ccr3−/− mice is correlated to alterations in the number of osteoclasts or differences in osteoclast size in vivo, static histomorphometric analyses were performed on TRAP-stained bone sections from Ccr3−/− and Ccr3+/+ mice. The number of osteoclasts in trabecular and cortical bones showed no significant difference between the genotypes (Fig. 8, A–B). In addition, no difference in osteoclast surface covering the underlying bone tissue could be seen (Fig. 8, C–D).Figure 7Increased bone formation rate (BFR) in Ccr3−/− long bones.

There were no significant differences, neither in the serum levels of TRAP5b, the bone resorption marker CTX-I, nor in the bone formation marker amino propeptide of type 1 collagen between genotypes (Fig. 9, A–C, respectively). To investigate if osteoblasts contribute to the disturbed bone remodeling in Ccr3−/− mice, we isolated osteoblasts from Ccr3+/+ and Ccr3−/− mice calvaria and cultured these primary osteoblasts for 6 to 12 days and performed gene expression analyses. The analyses showed that the osteoclast activator–related gene, Rankl, is upregulated in Ccr3−/− osteoblasts (Fig. 10A). Although the expression of the early differentiation transcription factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) was comparable in Ccr3+/+ and Ccr3−/− osteoblasts (Fig. 10B), the level of Sp7 mRNA, coding for the regulatory transcription factor osterix, was higher in the Ccr3−/− osteoblasts after 6, 9, and 12 days of culture (Fig. 10C). Similarly, the level of Spp1 mRNA, encoding the bone matrix protein osteopontin, was significantly higher in the Ccr3−/− osteoblasts at all three time points (Fig. 10D). In addition, higher levels of the Alp and Bglap mRNAs (encoding the enzyme for mineral deposition alkaline phosphatase and the bone matrix protein osteocalcin, respectively) were detected in Ccr3−/− osteoblasts after 6, 12, and 9 days of culture, respectively (Fig. 10, E–F). In this article, we show that the absence of CCR3 receptors cause thinner cortical bone and an elevated mineral formation and BFRs in adult male mice. In vitro analyses reveal that CCR3 deletion is coupled to higher mRNA expression of Ccl2, Ccr2, and Ccr5, together with lower Ccl5 mRNA expression, in preosteoclasts and osteoclasts. In addition, we show that the osteoclast size and activity are increased when CCR3 is missing. Moreover, primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts isolated from CCR3-deficient mice show increased mRNA expression of the osteoclast activator–related gene Rankl, as well as of genes encoding proteins associated with anchorage of osteoclasts and osteoblast differentiation. We and others have shown that the Ccr3 receptor mRNA expression is upregulated during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (7Kindstedt E. Holm C.K. Sulniute R. Martinez-Carrasco I. Lundmark R.

Cell Biochem. 2014; 115: 1290-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but it is unknown what significance the receptor has for osteoclast formation. In this study, we used CCR3-deficient mice and show that lack of CCR3 receptors causes formation of giant hypernucleated osteoclasts that display enhanced bone resorption in vitro. In vivo skeletal analyses show that the number of osteoclasts were equivalent in both CCR3-deficient and CCR3-proficient mice long bones, which corresponds to our observations from in vitro analyses. In vivo, however, we could not detect any difference in size of osteoclasts. One reason behind these discrepancies could be that two different units of measurements were compared, i.e., an area in vitro with a length in vivo, which generally does not reflect the whole three-dimensional size of the cells. The size of osteoclasts in vitro is estimated as an area measured in several wells of cell cultures, whereas in vivo as a length (millimeter) of osteoclasts estimated on one single section per mouse. Unfortunately, it is with current method impossible to estimate the size of an osteoclast and the number of nuclei per osteoclast on bone sections. In vitro, CCR3-deficient osteoclasts seeded on bone substrate show large osteoclasts with many nuclei that very efficiently resorb bone. This might be coupled to enhanced recruitment and fusion of preosteoclasts and/or increased osteoclast adherence, motility, and/or resorptive capacity. If this corresponds to the in vivo situation with osteoclasts on bone surfaces (BSs), the thinner cortical bone detected in the CCR3-deficient mice could be due to increased osteoclast activity when CCR3 is missing. Chemokine signaling commonly stimulates osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity in an indirect manner through upregulation of RANK and subsequent downstream signaling proteins (13Binder N.B.

Funct. 2017; 35: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, none of the analyzed genes associated with osteoclast differentiation or fusion were expressed differently in CCR3-deficient osteoclast cultures. Our finding of higher Ccl2, Ccr2, and Ccr5 gene expression could indirectly contribute to the increased fusion of osteoclasts, creating giant hypernucleated osteoclasts, and the heightened bone resorptive activity seen in CCR3-deficient osteoclast cultures. CCR5 is known to stimulate cellular locomotion and bone resorption activity of osteoclasts, which is associated with the arrangement of podosomes and adhesion complex molecules including Pyk2 (15Lee J.W.

Commun. 2017; 8: 2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased in vitro bone resorption in the CCR3-deficient osteoclast cultures on bone slices may be explained by increased osteoclast locomotion as the osteoclast function genes are not upregulated. Consistent with this notion, increased osteoclastogenesis is previously described in mice lacking CCL5 (18Wintges K. Beil F.T. Albers J. Jeschke A. Schweizer M. Claass B. Tiegs G. Amling M.

The M17 aminopeptidases from Plasmodium falciparum (PfA-M17) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv-M17) function as catalytically active hexamers to generate free amino acids from human hemoglobin and are drug targets for the design of novel antimalarial agents. However, the molecular basis for oligomeric assembly is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the active site metal ions essential for catalytic activity have a secondary structural role mediating the formation of active hexamers. We found that PfA-M17 and Pv-M17 exist in a metal-dependent dynamic equilibrium between active hexameric species and smaller inactive species that can be controlled by manipulating the identity and concentration of metals available. Mutation of residues involved in metal ion binding impaired catalytic activity and the formation of active hexamers. Structural resolution of Pv-M17 by cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography together with solution studies revealed that PfA-M17 and Pv-M17 bind metal ions and substrates in a conserved fashion, although Pv-M17 forms the active hexamer more readily and processes substrates faster than PfA-M17. On the basis of these studies, we propose a dynamic equilibrium between monomer ↔ dimer ↔ tetramer ↔ hexamer, which becomes directional toward the large oligomeric states with the addition of metal ions. This sophisticated metal-dependent dynamic equilibrium may apply to other M17 aminopeptidases and underpin the moonlighting capabilities of this enzyme family.

Although zinc ions are the most common occupants of both sites, site 1, or the loosely bound site, can also coordinate Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ (14Carpenter F.H. Vahl J.M.

A. 2010; 107: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The two active site metal ions within M17 aminopeptidases have previously been only described in terms of their necessity for catalytic function. In this study, we discovered that the active site metal ions of PfA-M17 and Pv-M17 also play a structural role, operating as part of a previously undescribed mechanism of activity regulation for M17 aminopeptidases. We show that binding of active site metal ions mediates the association of inactive oligomers into active hexamers, and the dynamic equilibrium between those states could be manipulated with mutations designed to compromise active site metal binding. Structural characterization of the hexameric and tetrameric conformations using X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy, in combination with analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) sedimentation velocity experiments, show that M17 aminopeptidases simultaneously adopt several oligomeric conformations and that the transition between oligomers (monomer dimer tetramer hexamer) is continuous, rapid, and directionally controlled by the metal ion environment. Recombinant PfA-M17 (residues 84–605) and Pv-M17 (residues 73–621) were successfully purified from a bacterial expression system using a two-step chromatography method. Both constructs contained an N-terminal deletion. Residues 1 to 83 were omitted from our original PfA-M17 construct to remove an asparagine-rich low complexity region after attempts to produce the full-length protein in E. coli were unsuccessful (19Stack C.M.

Therefore, for consistency between the constructs, the Pv-M17 construct was designed with the same N-terminal truncation site despite the lack of an asparagine-rich low complexity region. The purified proteins were active in previously reported assay conditions (19Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Teuscher F. Grembecka J.

Parasitol. 2010; 170: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and had similar kinetic parameters to those previously reported (Table 1). Interestingly, the Pv-M17 enzyme is significantly faster than PfA-M17 in the presence of both Co2+ and Mn2+, with kcat values at least 10x higher than PfA-M17 (Table 1). During purification, both Pv-M17 and PfA-M17 eluted from SEC as broad peaks suggestive of poorly separated oligomeric species. To further investigate the solution species of each protein, size exclusion chromatography multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments with 100 μl samples at 3 mg/ml were used to dissect the oligomeric content of the protein samples. At the lower concentration and volume, PfA-M17 separated into two distinct populations at molar masses of ∼380 kDa and ∼70 kDa, which approximately correlated to a hexamer and monomer respectively (Fig. 1A). The peak area shows that PfA-M17 predominantly adopted the monomeric conformation with only a small proportion forming the hexamer. Pv-M17 also separated into two distinct populations, at a high molar mass (∼330–370 kDa) spanning the hexamer molecular weight and at a low molar mass (∼120 kDa), correlating to a dimer (Fig. 1B). These two populations were of approximately equal concentration and connected by a nonzero baseline, indicating dynamic movement between the two populations (Fig. 1B, Gray bars). Catalytic activity of the separated PfA-M17 and Pv-M17 oligomeric states was almost completely limited to the hexameric populations (Fig. 1, A–B). The small oligomeric species display some residual activity; however, this may be because of the small oligomers forming larger active species throughout the course of the experiment. More distinct separation of the Pv-M17 and PfA-M17 oligomeric states was achieved using AUC sedimentation velocity experiments. Higher resolution separation of Pv-M17 showed at least three distinct populations at standardized (s20,w) sedimentation coefficients of ∼6S, ∼9S, and ∼12S, with dynamic movement between these three populations (Fig. 1C). AUC analysis of PfA-M17 suggested the small molar mass peak observed in SEC-MALS experiments actually consists of two distinct populations at s20,w of approximately 4S and 6S (Fig. 1C).Table 1Kinetic characterization of PfA-M17 and Pv-M17 wild types and mutants against fluorescent substrate, Leu–Mec, in presence of 1.0 mM Co2+ or 1.0 mM Mn2+EnzymeKm (μM)kcat (s−1)kcat/Km (M−1∙s−1)Co2+Mn2+Co2+Mn2+Co2+Mn2+PfA-M1715 ± 0.826.5 ± 1.00.069 ± 0.0041.2 ± 0.03460046,153PfA-M17(AL)57.0 ± 9.037.1 ± 5.50.04 ± 0.00020.002 ± 0.0000770154Pv-M1720.1 ± 2.534.2 ± 3.70.98 ± 0.113.8 ± 4.548,514403,508Pv-M17(AL)28.6 ± 5.133.0 ± 3.90.126 ± 0.0150.006 ± 0.00044381181Pv-M17Δ125-15161.9 ± 0.522.3 ± 0.61.66 ± 0.0326.6 ± 0.0926,8171,192,825±SEM. Open table in a new tab ±SEM. To create homogenous monomeric or stable small oligomeric species for use as a reference in AUC experiments, we sought to introduce point mutations to disrupt hexamerization. Investigation of our PfA-M17 structure identified that Trp525 and Tyr533 formed two sets of pi-pi stacking interactions with corresponding residues from another chain within the hexamer. We hypothesized that these two residues were likely involved in stabilizing the hexameric conformation. We mutated both residues to Ala to eliminate these aromatic interactions between subunits. In solution, the PfA-M17 (W525A + Y533A) protein formed a single species that had a sedimentation coefficient of ∼3.7S (Fig. 1C), which we confirmed as monomeric using sedimentation equilibrium experiments (Fig. S1). Monomeric PfA-M17 (W525A + Y533A) was enzymatically inactive compared with wild type PfA-M17 in the same assay conditions (Fig. 1D). From this result, we could predict that the PfA-M17 WT sample in Figure 1C contained monomeric species at 4S and dimeric species at 6S, whereas Pv-M17 contained the dimeric species at 6S and tetrameric and hexameric species at 9S and 12S, respectively. With a relationship between the hexameric conformation and catalytic activity confirmed, we were interested in investigating factors that mediate the association of small inactive oligomers into active hexamers. M17 aminopeptidases are metal-dependent proteases that coordinate at least two metal ions per active site (11McGowan S. Oellig C.A. Birru W.A. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Stack C.M. Lowther J.

Our analysis of purified PfA-M17 showed that it was predominantly monomeric in solution when purified from a bacterial expression system and that this monomer was catalytically inactive (Fig. 1, A and D). However, previous studies by us (11McGowan S. Oellig C.A. Birru W.A. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Stack C.M. Lowther J. Skinner-Adams T. Mucha A. Kafarski P. Grembecka J. Trenholme K.R. Buckle A.M.

Therefore, we postulated that metal ions may also be playing an essential role in the formation of active hexamers. To investigate the influence of different metal ions on oligomerization and activity, both AUC sedimentation velocity experiments and catalytic activity assays were conducted in the presence of biologically relevant metal ions (Zn2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+). We observed unique oligomerization and activity responses to each metal ion tested and an overall behavioral difference between Pv-M17 and PfA-M17. PfA-M17 did not completely hexamerize in any of the metal ion conditions tested (Fig. 2A), although Mn2+ and Co2+ did result in a shift toward the larger oligomeric states. Mg2+ failed to induce any oligomerization of PfA-M17 given the AUC sedimentation profile remained similar to that of the no metal added sample. Pv-M17 associated into a single species in the presence of Mn2+ and Co2+ with sedimentation coefficients at 12S and 13.5S, respectively (Fig. 2B). Mg2+ caused a more defined separation of different oligomeric species although had minimal effect on overall oligomeric species present. Using AUC sedimentation equilibrium experiments, the Mn2+-induced 12S species was confirmed to have a molar mass of ∼356 kDa, consistent with the active hexamer (Fig. S2, Table S1). This also indicated that Co2+ was possibly inducing Pv-M17 to form a soluble aggregate larger than the hexameric conformation. Zn2+ was also tested as part of these experiments for both proteins; however, the proteins precipitated at low metal ion concentration. Catalytic activity was also tested using the same panel of biologically relevant metal ions. Both PfA-M17 and Pv-M17 exhibited the highest activity in the presence of Mn2+ and Co2+ and negligible activity in Mg2+ and Zn2+ (Fig. 2C). When compared with AUC data, the metal ions that induced a complete or partial oligomeric shift toward the hexameric conformation were the same ions that corresponded with high catalytic activity levels. However, the presence of a large soluble aggregate was detrimental to catalytic activity, as evidenced by the Co2+-treated samples. Buffer condit"
https://openalex.org/W3111119714,"This paper explores the use of the meshfree computational mechanics method, the Material Point Method (MPM), to model the composition and damage of typical renal calculi, or kidney stones. Kidney stones are difficult entities to model due to their complex structure and failure behavior. Better understanding of how these stones behave when they are broken apart is a vital piece of knowledge to medical professionals whose aim is to remove these stone by breaking them within a patient’s body. While the properties of individual stones are varied, the common elements and proportions are used to generate synthetic stones that are then placed in a digital experiment to observe their failure patterns. First a more traditional engineering model of a Brazil test is used to create a tensile fracture within the center of these stones to observe the effect of stone consistency on failure behavior. Next a novel application of MPM is applied which relies on an ultrasonic wave being carried by surrounding fluid to model the ultrasonic treatment of stones commonly used by medical practitioners. This numerical modeling of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) reveals how these different stones failure in a more real-world situation and could be used to guide further research in this field for safer and more effective treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3111668225,"Sitting in the giant lecture hall on my first day of university, I felt terribly out of place. As the first and only member of my family to attend college, leaving my home in rural Malaysia to study in New Zealand was exciting—and terrifying. I wished I was as confident and articulate as my classmates. In the years that followed, I coped by assimilating, relinquishing parts of my old self and remodeling my identity to blend in. I tuned my accent to sound like my classmates. I lied that my uncle was a doctor. I made friends, but consciously changing myself was mentally and emotionally draining. It took me a long time to see there could be another way.



> “I have stopped suppressing my identity as a first-generation, international student.” 

When I came to the United States for graduate school, I changed my identity again. When my labmates made references to classic American films or books that I had never heard of, I nodded knowingly to hide my ignorance. I learned how to make small talk. I began to introduce myself exclusively as Ethan—my adopted American name—instead of my formal “ethnic-sounding” name, Chee Kiang. These acts took effort that I could have spent on my studies, but I didn't see any other option.

My perspective began to change when I was a teaching assistant (TA) in my second year of grad school. My students' evaluations of me were filled with negative comments about my accent while saying nothing about my teaching. I was embarrassed, but this time I resolved to handle the situation differently. My former impulse to focus on fitting in largely stemmed from my lack of self-confidence, but I had grown over the years. I had altered my identity twice; I was not going to do it again.

So, instead of changing my accent, I learned to slow the pace of my speech and to reiterate important points. Many of my students became more engaged. They started to show up to my office hours, seek me out for help, and strike up conversations when they saw me outside the classroom. I realized that I did not need to change my accent to be understood. Assimilation was not the only option.

Since then, I have stopped suppressing my identity as a first-generation, international student and instead celebrate it as a strength. Because of the extra miles I have covered, I am resourceful. Because of the additional hurdles I have overcome, I am persistent and resilient.

Throughout my academic career, I have felt I must work extra hard to be seen and heard. This pressure can be taxing. But it also spurs me to seize opportunities and take on responsibilities that help me grow as a scientist and professional. I watch research seminars on YouTube when I have time to fill, host additional office hours as a TA, and volunteer to organize departmental retreats and research symposiums. It isn't easy, but I have learned so much along the way.

I want underrepresented students like me to have a fighting chance in the academic world—and now I have the confidence to help make that happen. During the summer, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement threatened to expel some international students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Like many other international students and scholars in the United States, I felt unwanted and betrayed. So I took action. I sent an email to my department chair suggesting that this year's retreat highlight the importance of diversity—in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, nationality, socioeconomic status, and more. Much to my delight, my proposal was accepted. Over the 2-day meeting, students and faculty members had fruitful conversations about inequities in academia and celebrated the beautiful science conducted by diverse researchers from within and outside our campus.

I am still stumbling through the mysterious, labyrinthine world of academia, but now with more confidence than the insecure 20-year-old who thought he did not belong in that lecture hall. I am not the same as all of my peers—and that's OK."
