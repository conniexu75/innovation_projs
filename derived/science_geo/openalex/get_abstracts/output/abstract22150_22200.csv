https://openalex.org/W2149919973,"Fragile X syndrome Is the most frequent form of inherited mental retardation and Is associated with a fragile site at Xg27.3. We identified human YAC clones that span fragile X site-induced translocation breakpoints coincident with the fragile X site. A gene (FMR-1) was identified within 8 four cosmid contig of YAC DNA that expresses a 4.8 kb message in human brain. Within a 7.4 kb EcoFII genomic fragment, containing FMR-1 exonic sequences distal to a CpG island previously shown to be hypermethylated in fragile X patients, is a fragile X site-induced breakpoint cluster region that exhibits length variation in fragile X chromosomes. This fragment contains a lengthy CGG repeat that is 250 by distal of the CpG island and maps within a FMR-1 axon. Localization of the brain-expressed FMR-1 gene to this EcoRl fragment suggests the involvement of this gene in the phenotypic expression of the fragile X syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2032371793,"Rolling of leukocytes on vascular endothelial cells, an early event in inflammation, can be reproduced in vitro on artificial lipid bilayers containing purified CD62, a selectin also named PADGEM and GMP-140 that is inducible on endothelial cells. Neutrophils roll on this selectin under flow conditions similar fo those found in postcapillary venules. Adhesion of resting or activated neutrophils through the integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1 to ICAM-1 in a lipid bilayer does not occur at physiologic shear stresses; however, static incubation of activated neutrophils allows development of adhesion that is greater than 100-fold more shear resistant than found on CD62. Addition of a chemoattractant to activate LFA-1 and Mac-1 results in the arrest of neutrophils rolling on bilayers containing both CD62 and ICAM-1. Thus, at physiologic shear stress, rolling on a selectin is a prerequisite for activation-induced adhesion strengthening through integrins."
https://openalex.org/W1999968276,"NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and non-NMDA receptors represent the two major classes of ion channel-linked glutamate receptors. Unlike the NMDA receptor channels, non-NMDA receptor channels have usually been thought to conduct monovalent cations only. Non-NMDA receptor ion channels that can be gated by kainic acid (KA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) are formed by the glutamate receptor subunits GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3. These subunits were expressed in various combinations in Xenopus oocytes so that their permeability to divalent cations could be studied. At physiological resting potentials, KA and AMPA elicited inward calcium currents in oocytes expressing GluR1, GluR3, and GluR1 plus GluR3. In contrast, oocytes expressing GluR1 plus GluR2 or GluR3 plus GluR2 showed no such permeability. Thus, in neurons expressing certain KA-AMPA receptor subunits, glutamate may trigger calcium-dependent intracellular events by activating non-NMDA receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2086551569,"The c-myb proto-oncogene encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. To better understand its normal biological function, we have altered the c-myb gene by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. Resulting homozygous c-myb mutant mice displayed an interesting phenotype. At day 13 of gestation these mice appeared normal, suggesting that c-myb is not essential for early development. By day 15, however, the mutant mice were severely anemic. Analysis indicated that embryonic erythropoiesis, which occurs in the yolk sac, was not impaired by the c-myb alteration. Adult-type erythropoiesis, which first takes place in the fetal liver, was greatly diminished in c-myb mutants, however. Additional hematopoietic lineages were similarly affected. These results are compatible with a role for c-myb in maintaining the proliferative state of hematopoietic progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066790769,"A variety of findings seem to functionally link brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), while distinguishing both of these factors from the third member of the neurotrophin family, nerve growth factor (NGF). Here we demonstrate that all three of these neuronal survival molecules bind similarly to the low affinity NGF receptor, but that BDNF and NT-3, unlike NGF, do not act via the high affinity NGF receptor. However, both BDNF and NT-3, but not NGF, bind to full-length and truncated forms of a receptor-like tyrosine kinase, trkB, for which no ligand had previously been identified. In addition to binding BDNF and NT-3, trkB can mediate functional responses to both of these neurotrophins when it is expressed in PC12 cells, although BDNF appears to be the more effective ligand. Thus trkB encodes an essential component of a functional receptor for BDNF and NT-3, but not for NGF. Further evidence predicts the existence of additional functional receptors for the neurotrophins."
https://openalex.org/W1996712322,"Functional glutamate receptors (GluRs) were transiently expressed in cultured mammalian cells from cloned complementary DNAs encoding GluR-A, -B, -C, or -D polypeptides. The steady-state current-voltage (I-V) relations of glutamate- and kainate-induced currents through homomeric channels fell into two classes: channels composed of either the GluR-A, -C, and -D subunits showed doubly rectifying I-V curves, and channels composed of the GluR-B subunits displayed simple outward rectification. The presence of GluR-B subunits in heteromeric GluRs determined the I-V behavior of the resulting channels. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a single amino acid difference (glutamine to arginine) in the putative transmembrane segment TM2 responsible for subunit-specific I-V relationships. The properties of heteromeric wild-type and mutant GluRs revealed that the dominance of GluR-B is due to the arginine residue in the TM2 region."

https://openalex.org/W2069514224,"Short peptides that contain the basic region of the HIV-1 Tat protein bind specifically to a bulged region in TAR RNA. A peptide that contained nine arginines (R9) also bound specifically to TAR, and a mutant Tat protein that contained R9 was fully active for transactivation. In contrast, a peptide that contained nine lysines (K9) bound TAR poorly and the corresponding protein gave only marginal activity. By starting with the K9 mutant and replacing lysine residues with arginines, a single arginine was identified that is required for specific binding and transactivation. Ethylation interference experiments suggest that this arginine contacts two adjacent phosphates at the RNA bulge. Model building suggests that the arginine η nitrogens and the ε nitrogen can form specific networks of hydrogen bonds with adjacent pairs of phosphates and that these arrangements are likely to occur near RNA loops and bulges and not within double-stranded A-form RNA. Thus, arginine side chains may be commonly used to recognize specific RNA structures."
https://openalex.org/W2012855723,"unc-104 encodes a novel kinesin paralog that may act as a microtubule-based motor in the nervous system. Neuronal cell lineages and axonogenesis are normal in unc-104 null mutants, but axons have few synaptic vesicles and make only a few small synapses. By contrast, neuron cell bodies have surfeits of similar vesicles tethered together within the cytoplasm. Based on behavioral and cellular phenotypes, we suggest that UNC-104 is a neuron-specific motor used for anterograde translocation of synaptic vesicles along axonal microtubules. Other membrane-bounded organelles are transported normally."

https://openalex.org/W1547915919,"Five different insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) were isolated from adult rat serum using gel filtration, ligand affinity chromatography, and two steps of reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Three of them were identified as IGFBP-2, -3, and -4 by their amino-terminal amino acid sequences. One of the remaining two proteins was the rat homologue of the partially characterized IGFBP isolated originally from human cerebrospinal fluid, while the other appeared to be a novel member of the IGFBP family. IGFBP-1 was not found in the adult rat serum under our experimental procedures. cDNAs encoding the novel IGFBP were isolated and characterized from a rat ovary and a human placenta library. The mature protein predicted for both species contained 252 amino acids including 18 cysteines that were located in the homologous positions as IGFBP-1, -2, -3, and -4. We propose to name this protein IGFBP-5. Northern analysis of IGFBP-5 mRNA in rat tissues demonstrated that transcription of this gene is highly active in kidney, although the mRNA was detectable in all tissues examined. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the five rat IGFBPs revealed a 47-60% similarity, indicating that their individual genes diverged from a single ancestral gene by successive gene duplication in a short time frame during evolution. The chromosomal localizations of IGFBP-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 genes in human have been determined using polymerase chain reaction on somatic cell hybrid DNAs of human and hamster, and the results showed that they were located on chromosomes 7, 2, 7, 17, and 5, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1504413484,"The human integrin VLA (very late activation antigens)-4 (CD49d/CD29), the leukocyte receptor for both the CS-1 region of plasma fibronectin (Fn) and the vascular cell surface adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), also mediates homotypic aggregation upon triggering with specific anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Epitope mapping of this integrin on the human B-cell line Ramos, performed with a wide panel of anti-VLA-4 mAb by both cross-competitive cell binding and protease sensitivity assays, revealed the existence of three topographically distinct epitopes on the alpha 4 chain, referred to as epitopes A-C. By testing this panel of anti-VLA-4 mAb for inhibition of cell binding to both a 38-kDa Fn fragment containing CS-1 and to VCAM-1, as well as for induction and inhibition of VLA-4 mediated homotypic cell adhesion, we have found overlapping but different functional properties associated with each epitope. Anti-alpha 4 mAb recognizing epitope B inhibited cell attachment to both Fn and VCAM-1, whereas mAb against epitope A did not block VCAM-1 binding and only partially inhibited binding to Fn. In contrast, mAb directed to epitope C did not affect cell adhesion to either of the two VLA-4 ligands. All mAb directed to site A, as well as a subgroup of mAb recognizing epitope B (called B2), were able to induce cell aggregation, but this effect was not exerted by mAb specific to site C and by a subgroup against epitope B (called B1). Moreover, although anti-epitope C and anti-epitope B1 mAb did not trigger aggregation, those mAb blocked aggregation induced by anti-epitope A or B2 mAb. In addition, anti-epitope A mAb blocked B2-induced aggregation, and conversely, anti-epitope B2 mAb blocked A-induced aggregation. Further evidence for multiple VLA-4 functions is that anti-Fn and anti-VCAM-1 antibodies inhibited binding to Fn or to VCAM-1, respectively, but did not affect VLA-4-mediated aggregation. In summary, we have demonstrated that there are at least three different VLA-4-mediated adhesion functions, we have defined three distinct VLA-4 epitopes, and we have correlated these epitopes with the different functions of VLA-4."
https://openalex.org/W1522506802,"The binding of IgE to the high affinity Fc epsilon receptor (Fc epsilon RI) on mast cells and basophils is mediated by the alpha-subunit of the tetrameric receptor complex. Based on sequence homologies, the 50-kDa alpha-subunit is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins and has two predicted disulfide-bonded loops. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the human alpha-subunit have been identified and separated into two major classes: inhibitory and noninhibitory antibodies. Inhibitory antibodies (i.e. 15A5) block 125I-IgE binding to a recombinant chimeric alpha-subunit (ch-alpha-protein) expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells and immunoprecipitate 125I-labeled purified ch-alpha-protein. Noninhibitory antibodies (i.e. 22E7) immunoprecipitate both 125I-labeled ch-alpha-protein and the soluble complex of 125I-IgE cross-linked to ch-alpha-protein but do not block 125I-IgE binding to the ch-alpha-protein expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both classes of antibodies bind to natural Fc epsilon RI present on human basophils and induce histamine release from these cells. Inhibitory antibody 15A5 specifically binds to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 125-140 of the putative second domain of the alpha-subunit sequence. All the inhibitory antibodies compete with 125I-15A5 for binding to the ch-alpha-protein, indicating that these antibodies recognize inhibitory epitopes that are either identical or sterically overlapping. Noninhibitory antibodies (i.e. 22E7) do not block 125I-15A5 binding to the ch-alpha-protein. These data suggest that antibodies binding to the predicted second domain of the alpha-subunit can inhibit IgE binding to the alpha-subunit, while antibodies binding at a distance from this site do not inhibit IgE binding. These inhibitory antibodies may block IgE binding to the ch-alpha-protein by direct overlap, steric inhibition, or induced conformational changes of the receptor contact points for IgE."
https://openalex.org/W2166178374,"Chimeric RNA molecules were detected by polymerase chain reaction ampllfication of kinetoplast RNA using a 3′ primer specific to mRNA and a 5′ primer specific to guide RNA (gRNA), and directly by Northern analysis. Covalent linkage of the 3′ oligo(U) tail of the gRNA to the mRNA occurs at editing sites. Chimeric molecules were isolated for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7 and cytochrome oxidase subunits II and III. We propose that these molecules are intermediates in the editing process and that successive transesterifications resuit in the transfer of uridine residues from the gRNA 3′ oligo(U) tail to an editing site, with the number of uridine residues determined by base pairing with adenine and guanine “guide” nucleotides in the gRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1515455066,"Cultured fibroblasts bind soluble protomeric fibronectin and mediate its conversion to insoluble disulfide-bonded multimers. The disulfide-bonded multimers are deposited in fibrillar pericellular matrix. Antifibronectin monoclonal antibodies were analyzed to identify domains of fibronectin required for assembly into matrix. Two antibodies, L8 and 9D2, inhibited binding and insolubilization of 125I-labeled plasma fibronectin by fibroblasts but did not inhibit binding of labeled amino-terminal 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin to matrix assembly sites. Immunoblotting of fibronectin fragments showed that the epitope for 9D2 is in the first type III homology sequence (III-1) whereas the epitope for L8 requires that the last type I sequence of the gelatin binding region (I-9) be contiguous to III-1 and is sensitive to reduction of disulfides in I-9. A 56-kDa gelatin-binding thermolysin fragment of fibronectin that contains III-1 and the L8 and 9D2 epitopes inhibited binding of fibronectin to cell layers 10-fold better than a 40-kDa gelatin-binding fragment that lacks III-1 and the antigenic sites. This 56-kDa fragment, however, did not bind specifically to cell layers. These results indicate that the I-9 and III-1 modules of fibronectin form a functional unit that mediates an interaction, perhaps between protomers, important in the assembly of fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1486975043,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is an important constituent of plasma lipoproteins and a ligand for several lipoprotein receptors. It is produced mainly in the liver but also in several peripheral tissues like brain, adrenal glands, kidney, and macrophages. Some of these tissues also coexpress lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an important enzyme in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. This suggested a possible coordinate expression of these genes and led us to analyze whether adipocytes, a major source of LPL, could also synthesize apoE. Northern blotting experiments showed that apoE mRNA is found in differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as biopsies of human adipose tissue maintained in organ culture but not in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. [35S]Methionine pulse-labeling experiments revealed that apoE protein is produced in human adipose tissue and differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in preadipocytes. In biosynthetic labeling experiments, most apoE was found to be cell associated even after prolonged chase periods. Heparin treatment of the cultured cells did not enhance apoE secretion. During differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, the onset of apoE gene expression was later than that of LPL. The apoE mRNA and intracellular apoE protein concentrations increased linearly with time of differentiation, at least through day 11, whereas LPL showed highest expression at day 7 and then declined. The increase in apoE mRNA correlated with the cellular lipid content. Inhibition of lipid accumulation in differentiated cells by biotin deprivation decreased apoE expression. Cholesterol-loading experiments suggested that apoE mRNA expression is regulated by the intracellular free cholesterol content of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In contrast, the LPL mRNA level was not influenced by biotin deprivation or cholesterol loading. Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor, a potent inhibitor of LPL gene transcription, had no effect on adipocyte apoE mRNA levels. Therefore, although apoE and LPL are both expressed in adipocytes in a differentiation-dependent manner, the time course of their expression differs as do their responses to cellular lipid content and tumor necrosis factor. We conclude that these genes are not coordinately regulated in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2037343561,"Destruction of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires the presence of HLA (human lymphocyte antigen) class I antigens on the target cells for adhesion as well as for triggering of the antigen-specific T cell receptor. Rejection of xenogeneic human pancreatic islets and liver was circumvented by masking, before transplantation, donor antigens with F(ab')2 antibody fragments to HLA class I or tissue-specific epitopes. This strategy eliminated the need for recipient immunosuppression and allowed islet xenograft survival beyond 200 days, as demonstrated functionally by C peptide secretion as well as by histology. These in vivo observations are consistent with the importance of donor HLA class I in eliciting graft rejection and have potential applicability to the successful transplantation of other HLA class I-bearing donor tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2023384252,"Some strains of Escherichia coli contain retroelements (retrons) that encode genes for reverse transcriptase and branched, multicopy, single-stranded DNA (msDNA) linked to RNA. However, the origin of retrons is unknown. A P4-like cryptic prophage was found that contains a retroelement (retron Ec73) for msDNA-Ec73 in an E. coli clinical strain. The entire genome of this prophage, named phi R73, is 12.7 kilobase pairs and is flanked by 29-base pair direct repeats derived from the 3' end of the selenocystyl transfer RNA gene (selC). P2 bacteriophage caused excision of the phi R73 prophage and acted as a helper to package phi R73 DNA into an infectious virion. The newly formed phi R73 closely resembled P4 as a virion and in its lytic growth. Retronphage phi R73 lysogenized a new host strain, reintegrating its genome into the selC gene of the host chromosome and enabling the newly formed lysogens to produce msDNA-Ec73. Hence, retron Ec73 can be transferred intercellularly as part of the genome of a helper-dependent retronphage."
https://openalex.org/W1720860999,"A full length human androgen receptor (hAR) cDNA was constructed from cDNA and genomic clones. Structurally the 10.6-kilobase (kb) hAR cDNA consists of a long 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR, 1.1 kb), a previously described open reading frame (ORF, 2.7 kb) (Trapman, J., Klaassen, P., Kuiper, G. G. J. M., van der Korput, J. A. G. M., Faber, P. W., van Rooij, H. C. J., Geurts van Kessel, A., Voorhorst, M. M., Mulder, E., and Brinkmann, A. O. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Endocrinol. 61, 257-262), and a very long 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR, 6.8 kb). The complete 5'- and 3'-UTRs were found to be encoded by the previously reported first and eight protein coding exons of the hAR gene, respectively (Kuiper, G. G. J. M., Faber, P. W., van Rooij, H. C. J., van der Korput, J. A. G. M., Ris-Stalpers, C., Klaassen, P., Trapman, J., and Brinkmann, A. O. (1989) J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2, R1-R4). Two major sites of transcription initiation were identified in a 13-base pair region. DNA fragments spanning these transcription initiation sites conferred promoter activity upon a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construct. Two equally effective, functional polyadenylation signals (ATTAAA and CATAAA) at a mutual distance of 221 base pairs were detected. The ATTAAA hexamer sequence gave rise to multiple sites of poly(A) addition, whereas only one position was used following the CATAAA hexamer. In LNCaP prostatic carcinoma cells an alternatively spliced hAR mRNA species was identified which lacks 3 kb of the 3'-UTR."
https://openalex.org/W1552619604,"Transcription start sites of chicken mitochondrial DNA have been mapped in the control region by direct sequencing of in vitro capped mitochondrial RNA species, by primer extension and by S1 nuclease protection analysis. Transcription of the heavy strand initiates predominantly at a site 156 nucleotides upstream of the tRNA(Phe) gene, i.e. about 135 nucleotides further upstream than the corresponding sites in amphibia and mammals. On the opposite strand, transcription starts predominantly one nucleotide removed from the site in the heavy strand. The L-strand position start site is similar to that found in other vertebrates. The chicken mitochondrial DNA control region thus contains one major transcriptional promoter, whose bidirectional capacity is similar to the situation in amphibia but which contrasts to the mainly unidirectional capacity of mammalian promoters. In chicken mitochondria, the sequence comprising the start sites is A + T rich and contains an almost perfect inverted repeat which can be folded into a cruciform structure. The heavy and light strand initiation sites are flanked on their respective 3' ends by an octanucleotide sequence matching those surrounding the start sites in Xenopus laevis (5'-ACPuTTATA-3'). This motif is found associated with the H-strand start sites in mouse but is not present in human nor bovine mitochondrial DNA promoters."

https://openalex.org/W2172007677,"During chronic acidosis, the levels of the rat renal mRNAs that encode the mitochondrial glutaminase (GA) and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) are increased 6-fold. Following acute recovery of chronic acidosis, the levels of the two mRNAs are rapidly and coordinately decreased, returning to normal within 13-17 h. In contrast, the increases in GA and PCK mRNAs during acute onset of acidosis occur with very different kinetics. The increase in PCK mRNA occurs rapidly and reaches a maximum within 7 h, whereas the GA mRNA is increased after a 4-7-h lag and then plateaus at 14-17 h. Treatment with dexamethasone or with cAMP analogs significantly increases the level of renal PCK mRNA but has no effect on the level of GA mRNA. Nuclear run-on experiments indicate that the acute induction of PCK mRNA is primarily due to an increased rate of transcription. However, transcription of GA mRNA is unaffected by acute acidosis. Therefore, the changes in the two mRNAs are temporally coordinated but occur through different mechanisms. Furthermore, the inductive effects of acidosis are not mediated solely through glucocorticoid or cAMP regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1551501779,"Treatment of BC3H1 myocytes or 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with fluoroaluminate (AlF4-), a direct activator of G proteins, increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 42-kDa cytosolic protein. AlF4- induced a parallel increase in protein kinase activity toward myelin basic protein (MBP) in partially purified cell extracts. To test whether AlF4- was activating the 42-kDa MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase, extracts from AlF4--treated cells were taken through the chromatographic steps routinely used to purify MAP kinase from growth factor-stimulated cells. Following phenyl-Superose chromatography, a peak of MBP kinase activity eluted at a position characteristic of MAP kinase. Immunoblotting of the active fractions with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed a single reactive protein band of Mr 42,000. Stimulation of MAP kinase by AlF4- was rapid, peaking within 15 min and persisting for at least 1 h. In contrast, the activation of MAP kinase by insulin was transient, characteristic of its activation by growth factors in other cell types. Although concentrations of sodium fluoride greater than 1 mM also activated MAP kinase, this effect was shown to be dependent upon the simultaneous presence of aluminum ions in the medium. Activation of MAP kinase by AlF4- was not affected by either cellular depletion of protein kinase C or pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. Potential sites of action of AlF4- are discussed. These findings suggest that activation of a G protein(s) in intact cells can initiate events that result in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1516144786,"Treatment of the transformed glucocorticoid receptor with hydrogen peroxide promotes the formation of disulfide bonds and inhibits the ability of the receptor to bind to DNA (Tienrungroj, W., Meshinchi, S., Sanchez, E. R., Pratt, S. E., Grippo, J. F., Holmgren, A., and Pratt, W. B. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6992-7000). It has not been determined whether the inhibition of DNA binding activity is due to disulfide bonds formed within the DNA binding domain or between the DNA binding domain and another region of the receptor. In this paper, we examined the ability of hydrogen peroxide to inactivate the DNA binding activity of the mouse glucocorticoid receptor. We show that inhibition of DNA binding activity caused by hydrogen peroxide can be accounted for entirely by the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues lying within the 15-kDa tryptic fragment containing the DNA binding domain of the receptor. Reversal of the peroxide-induced inactivation of DNA binding activity requires both zinc and a thiol-disulfide exchange reagent, such as dithiothreitol. Peroxide also eliminates recognition of the intact receptor and the 15-kDa tryptic fragment by the BuGR monoclonal antibody, and the reactivity of the BuGR epitope is restored by reduction without a requirement for zinc. Pretreatment of the receptor with methyl methanethiosulfonate inhibits much of the peroxide-mediated inactivation of the BuGR epitope but pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide does not. Similarly, DNA binding activity of the receptor is inhibited by methyl methanethiosulfonate but not by N-ethylmaleimide. These results are consistent with the proposal that peroxide promotes the formation of disulfide bonds between thiols that lie spatially close to one another in the 15-kDa tryptic fragment, resulting in rapid elimination of zinc. Restoration of the zinc finger structure restores DNA-binding activity but restoration of the BuGR epitope requires only reduction without restoration of the zinc fingers."
https://openalex.org/W1514133366,"The ability of insulin secretagogues to stimulate insulin gene transcription was analyzed in the murine insulinoma cell line beta TC3, which had been derived from a transgenic mouse expressing SV40 T antigen under control of the rat insulin II gene regulatory region. Glucose induced a 3-fold increase in the transcription of both the endogenous mouse insulin genes and the transgene. This effect was inhibited by D600, a calcium channel blocker, which also inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion in these cells. This suggests that similar signals may be involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin gene transcription. Agents that increase intracellular levels of cAMP did not have a significant effect on the transcription of either the insulin genes or the transgene. Stimulation of transcription of the RIP-Tag transgene by glucose suggests that the 695-base pair fragment of the insulin gene regulatory region that is included in the transgene contains the cis elements required for response to the glucose-induced signal."
https://openalex.org/W174482231,"All five functional domains of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor were assembled in their modern form more than 350 million years ago, as revealed from the sequence of two cloned cDNAs from the frog Xenopus laevis. The two cDNAs appear to represent duplicated copies of the LDL receptor gene that arose when the entire genome of Xenopus duplicated approximately 30 million years ago. Both frog LDL receptors bound Xenopus LDL with high affinity and human LDL with lower affinity when expressed in monkey COS cells. The receptors also showed high affinity for rabbit beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein and canine apoE-HDLc, both of which contain apolipoprotein E. Each of the seven cysteine-rich repeats in the ligand binding domain of the Xenopus receptors resembles its counterpart in the human, indicating that these repeats had already acquired their independent structures by the time of amphibian development. The cytoplasmic tail of both Xenopus receptors is 86% identical to the human, including the FDNPVY sequence necessary for internalization in coated pits. The attainment of a fully developed receptor structure in Xenopus suggests that earlier forms of the receptor may exist in animals that are older than amphibians. An accompanying paper demonstrates that expression of both Xenopus receptor genes is controlled by a sterol regulatory element that closely resembles the human sequence (Mehta, K.D., Brown, M.S., Bilheimer, D.W., and Goldstein, J.L.

H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7018-7023). Additional monoclonal antibodies are characterized further. When five of these monoclonal antibodies were assessed for their ability to affect SR Ca2+ uptake three of these antibodies had no effect on SR Ca2+ uptake, whereas the other two monoclonals were able to stimulate SR Ca2+ uptake to levels similar to those caused by phosphorylation of phospholamban at different calcium concentrations. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to various portions of phospholamban in a competitive binding assay, it was possible to map the epitope site of monoclonals which stimulate the (Ca(2+)-Mg2+)-ATPase activity to phospholamban residues 7-16. These results implicate phospholamban residues 7-16 in the regulation of the (Ca(2+)-Mg2+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1569932448,"Heat-shock stress causes inactivation and aggregation of various cellular proteins which become further insoluble. Previous studies have shown that the interferon-induced p68 kinase activity was greatly reduced in extracts of heat-shocked HeLa cells, and that the loss of activity was due to a decreased solubility of the enzyme. Here we show that the p68 kinase which is normally evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, aggregates as a thick ring around the nucleus in heat-shocked cells. The 70-kDa constitutive heat-shock proteins are major insolubilized proteins during stress and we find them to colocalize with the p68 kinase after stress. Treatments of cells with drugs which disrupt the cytoskeleton, such as colcemid and cytochalasin E, do not hinder the enzyme insolubilization during heat-shock. On the contrary, heat-protectors such as glycerol and deuterium oxide (D2O) keep the p68 kinase under a soluble and active form during heat-shock stress. Similarly, an attenuation of the insolubilization of this enzyme is observed in cells rendered thermo-tolerant by a previous heat-shock, suggesting that heat-shock proteins may also contribute to the protection. During the recovery period at normal temperature after heat-shock, resolubilization occurs and most of the enzyme is again recovered under an active soluble form."
https://openalex.org/W1963761845,"Alloreactive T cells recognize a complex composed of an allogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule and a peptide derived from the processing of nonpolymorphic proteins. A sizable fraction of MHC class II alloreactive T cells is shown to recognize peptides derived from constitutive processing of human serum proteins. One such epitope is a fragment of human serum albumin. This epitope bound selectively to the human class II molecule DRw11 and was constitutively present on antigen-presenting cells in vivo. These data indicate that, in the case of MHC class II, peptides involved in allorecognition may originate from exogenous proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1567495621,"Both platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are produced by activated macrophages and are thought to contribute to bone remodeling, but their precise roles remain to be clarified. The interaction between PDGF and IL-1 was, therefore, studied in normal osteoblast-like cells (MC3T3-E1). The expression of alpha- and beta-PDGF receptors on MC3T3-E1 cells was detected by RNA blot analysis and confirmed by immunoblot analysis. PDGF-induced chemotactic as well as mitogenic activities were synergistically enhanced by either IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta (40 units/ml) pretreatment in serum-free medium, although IL-1 alone did not show any detectable chemotactic activities. This biological enhancement by IL-1 was accompanied by a selective increase of alpha-PDGF receptor expression, following the augmentation of alpha receptor autophosphorylation and inositol phosphate hydrolysis induced by PDGF-AA. These findings suggest that PDGF and IL-1 are jointly involved in the bone-remodeling microenvironment as local coupling factors."
https://openalex.org/W1539172752,"Integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is divalent metal ion-dependent; however, a demonstration of the interaction between native integrins and divalent metal ions is lacking. Here we provide direct evidence that the vitronectin receptor (VNR) is a metalloprotein. The unique electron shell of Co(II), an ion which we show supports ligand recognition by VNR, enables its oxidative conversion to inert Co(III). This property facilitated of VNR with 58Co(III) by oxidation of the metal ion in situ (i.e. in position). An average of 3.5 +/- 0.5 mol of cobalt were incorporated per mol of VNR. The ability of VNR to bind metal ions was independently confirmed by examining the interaction between VNR and Mn2+ under native conditions. The apparent high affinity between VNR and Mn2+ allowed us to observe the specific binding between 54Mn2+ and VNR by equilibrium gel filtration studies. Interestingly, the oxidative incorporation of Co(III) into VNR specifically blocked ligand binding, suggesting that the coordination sphere of metal ion bound to VNR is a critical determinant in integrin-ligand recognition. Furthermore, Mn2+ abolished the oxidative affinity labeling of VNR with Co(III) and consequently blocked the inactivation of VNR by in situ incorporation of Co(III). Thus, Mn2+ and Co2+ bind to the same or mutually exclusive sites on VNR. These observations provide the first demonstration that an integrin, specifically VNR, is a metalloprotein and demonstrate a functional link between the coordination sphere of the bound metal ion and ligand recognition by this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1520382361,"Sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) is an intracellular protein of Mr 13,096. In vitro studies have shown that it is involved in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. This protein is believed to participate in these activities by forming a stoichiometric complex with the sterol. Because these activities occur in different intracellular locations, i.e. mitochondria, peroxisomes, and cytosol, it can be predicted that SCP-2 targets to these sites. In this report we show that a mouse cDNA (785 base pairs) encodes a precursor form of SCP-2 containing a N-terminal presequence and an additional C-terminal residue. These additional amino acid residues are found in proteins targeted to the mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. These signals are not found in SCP-2 purified from rat liver cytosol which is believed to be a cytosolic form. Northern analysis shows that there are four species of mRNA which hybridize to a SCP-2-specific probe at 1.0, 1.7, 2.2, and 2.9 kilobases. Southern analysis shows that the gene is distributed over a large amount of DNA or that there are multiple genes. We have cloned the cytosolic/peroxisomal form of mouse SCP-2 into the Escherichia coli expression vector pKK233-2 and have expressed and purified recombinant mouse SCP-2, Mr 13,034. The purified recombinant SCP-2 is immunoreactive to rabbit anti-rat SCP-2 antibody. It also has biological activity equivalent to homogeneous rat liver SCP-2 in stimulating the microsomal conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol and in the esterification of cholesterol by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase by rat liver microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1502926059,"The proteoglycans (cell-associated and culture media) in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in culture were analyzed before and during differentiation into adipocytes. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate and [3H] glucosamine for 24 h and then extracted and analyzed. There was a 1.68 +/- 0.07-fold increase in the 35S in medium proteoglycan during differentiation, whereas cell-associated proteoglycan radioactivity showed no increase. Analyses of radiolabeled molecules using ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and high performance liquid chromatography after enzymatic or alkaline digestion indicated that all of the 35S label was recovered as two major species of chondroitin 4-sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG-I and CSPG-II) and 7% as heparan sulfate proteoglycan. CSPG-I has a mass of approximately 970 kDa with multiple chondroitin sulfate chains (average of 50 kDa each) and a core protein of approximately 370 kDa including oligosaccharides. CSPG-II has a mass of 140 kDa with one or two chondroitin sulfate chains (average of 68 kDa each) and a core protein of 41 kDa including oligosaccharides. CSPG-I appears to be similar to versican, whereas CSPG-II is similar to decorin and/or biglycan, found in other fibroblastic cells. Cell differentiation was associated with a specific increase in CSPG-I (4.0 +/- 0.2-fold in media and 3.2 +/- 0.5-fold in the cell-associated form). This system should facilitate study of the functional roles of proteoglycans during growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1582391412,"The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is the fast acting inhibitor of plasminogen activators (tissue-type (t-PA) and urokinase type-PA) and is an essential regulatory protein of the fibrinolytic system. Its P1-P1' reactive center (R346 M347) acts as a bait for tight binding to t-PA/urokinase-type PA. In vivo, PAI-1 is encountered in complex with vitronectin, an interaction known to stabilize its activity but not to affect the second-order association rate constant (k1) between PAI-1 and t-PA. Nevertheless, by using PAI-1 reactive site variants (R346M, M347S, and R346M M347S), we show that the binding of vitronectin to the PAI-1 mutant proteins improves plasminogen activator inhibition. In the absence of vitronectin the PAI-1 R346M mutants are virtually inactive toward t-PA (k1 less than 1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1). In contrast, in the presence of vitronectin the rate of association increases about 1,000-fold (k1 of 6-8 x 10(5) M-1 s-1). This inhibition coincides with the formation of serpin-typical, sodium dodecyl sulfide-stable t-PA.PAI-1 R346M (R346M M347S) complexes. As evidenced by amino acid sequence analysis, the newly created M346-M/S347 peptide bond is susceptible to attack by t-PA, similar to the wild-type R346-M347 peptide bond, indicating that in the presence of vitronectin M346 functions as an efficient P1 residue. In addition, we show that the inhibition of t-PA and urokinase-type PA by PAI-1 mutant proteins is accelerated by the presence of the nonprotease A chains of the plasminogen activators."
https://openalex.org/W1608631034,"Increasing evidence shows the existence of nonproliferation-specific gene(s) whose expression is mostly present in growth-arrested cells. One member of this gene family has been identified by previous work as a nuclear protein of 57,000 Da, termed statin. Logical extensions of statin research are to identify the genomic and cDNA clones encoding for statin and to study the regulation of statin gene expression. During the search for the statin gene, we have identified a cDNA clone and a genomic clone named S1 and S10, respectively, by screening a rat brain lambda gt11 expression library with the statin antibody and subsequently using S1 cDNA as a probe to screen a rat genomic cosmid library. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the S1 cDNA and S10 genomic clones. Primary sequence analyses indicate that the derived amino acid sequence of S1 shares high homology (greater than 92.6%) with human elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), whereas the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions are less than 20% homologous. Despite the unusually high degree of similarity between S1 and human EF-1 alpha at the amino acid sequence level, their protein products are different and immunologically distinct. The in vitro transcription and translation product of S1 (pS1), a 49,000-Da polypeptide, reacts only with the monoclonal antibody against statin; this antibody exhibits no antigenic reaction to the EF-1 alpha protein. Northern blot analysis shows that the S1 message is most abundant in G0 phase of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, but becomes significantly reduced in G1 and S phase cells. EF-1 alpha messages do not show such dramatic changes during cell cycle phase transition. These findings suggest that the expression of the identified S1 cDNA clone is specific for nonproliferating cells and that the in vitro translation product of the S1 cDNA is recognized by the statin antibody. Genomic Southern blots indicate that S1 cDNA is encoded by a single copy gene in the rat genome and is a unique member of the EF-1 alpha/S1 supermultigene family. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that the rat S1 transcription unit is 12 kilobase pairs in length and contains seven introns. The organization of exons is virtually identical between S1 and human EF-1 alpha. In contrast, neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box is located in the proximal 5'-flanking regions from positions -1 to -1359 of the S1 gene, where we could expect to find the regulatory region containing the elements controlling gene expression; no evident sequence homology to the human EF-1 alpha gene is detected in this region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1558100345,"Abstract We demonstrate a rapid activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in intact rat parotid acini in response to muscarinic (carbachol; K1/2 = 0.4 microM) and alpha-adrenergic (epinephrine; K1/2 = 0.1 microM) stimulation. This rapid activation is apparently distinct from the relatively slow activation of the exchanger (t1/2 greater than or equal to 5 min) reported previously (Manganel, M., and Turner, R. J. (1989) J. Membr. Biol. 111, 191-198). This rapid activation is not produced by treatment of acini with active diacylglycerol analogues nor prevented by protein kinase inhibitors, arguing against the involvement of protein kinase C-dependent processes. Stimulation of the exchanger is, however, produced by concentrations of ionomycin which yield intracellular calcium levels in the physiologic (secretagogue-induced) range. In addition, chelation of intracellular calcium with 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid blocks the effect of carbachol, but calmodulin antagonists are without effect. The possibility that the rapid activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger may be associated with cell shrinkage arising from carbachol-induced calcium mobilization is explored. In support of this suggestion we present evidence that: (i) the Na+/H+ exchanger is stimulated by shrinkage of these cells, (ii) the carbachol dose dependence of Na+/H+ exchange activation correlates well with that of shrinkage (but not with that of intracellular calcium levels), and (iii) maneuvers which blunt carbachol- or calcium-induced shrinkage also blunt activation of the exchanger. We suggest that this osmoregulatory response may play an important role in maintaining ionic homeostasis during the acinar fluid secretory process."
https://openalex.org/W2157543705,"Expression of a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell taurine transporter was examined in Xenopus oocytes that had been injected with poly(A)+ RNA extracted from MDCK cells. Compared with water-injected oocytes, injection of total poly(A)+ RNA resulted in an increase in Na(+)-dependent taurine uptake which was directly related to the amount of RNA injected. The magnitude of expression in poly(A)+ RNA-injected oocytes was 5-10-fold higher than that of water-injected oocytes. Since the Vmax of taurine uptake in MDCK cells is increased by culture in hypertonic medium, we compared oocyte taurine uptake after injection with poly(A)+ RNA from MDCK cells cultured in hypertonic medium with uptake in oocytes injected with poly(A)+ RNA from hypertonic cells elicited twice the taurine uptake elicited by poly(A)+ RNA from isotonic cells. The transporter expressed in oocytes was like that in MDCK cells: it was completely dependent on external sodium and was also anion dependent (Cl- greater than or equal to Br- greater than SCN- much greater than gluconate-). Other beta-amino acids, beta-alanine and hypotaurine, inhibited taurine uptake, but L-alanine and 2-(methylamino) isobutyric acid did not. The apparent Km of the transporter was 7.0 microM. After size fractionation on a sucrose density gradient, poly(A)+ RNA encoding for the MDCK taurine transporter was found in the fraction whose average size was 4.4 kilobases."
https://openalex.org/W1538596413,"Gene expression in eukaryotes can be regulated by controlling the efficiency of transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II. The composition of the elongation complex is, however, poorly understood. Previous work has identified DNA sequences which block RNA polymerase II transcription and factors which stimulate RNA chain elongation. Here, I have purified elongation complexes arrested at discrete template locations. Complexes were rapidly and efficiently precipitated from in vitro transcription reactions using a monoclonal antibody that binds RNA. The isolated complexes remained transcriptionally active. This technique enables the facile manipulation of transcription elongation complexes. Using this approach, I show that transcription initiation factor alpha is not associated with a RNA polymerase II elongation complex. Since others have shown that alpha associates stoichiometrically with DNA, RNA polymerase II, and other required factors in an initiation complex, this work suggests that alpha departs from the transcription complex after nucleotides are required but before extensive RNA chain synthesis. In this regard alpha resembles the bacterial promoter-recognition factor sigma."
https://openalex.org/W1560452225,"An RNA helicase, isolated from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells, displaced duplex RNA in the presence of any one of the eight common nucleoside triphosphates. The unwinding reaction was supported most efficiently by ATP and GTP and poorly by dCTP and dTTP. The enzyme activity, purified 300-fold, contained two major protein bands of 80 and 55 kDa when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All fractions that contained RNA helicase activity also possessed single-stranded RNA-dependent nucleoside triphosphatase activity. Purified RNA helicase fractions displaced a hybrid of U4/U6 RNAs with the same efficiency as it displaced other duplex RNA structures. In contrast, the RNA helicase did not displace duplex RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA structures. Evidence is presented that suggests that this RNA helicase can displace duplex RNA by translocating in both the 3' to 5' and the 5' to 3' directions. The properties of the RNA helicase described here differ from the deaminase RNA unwinding activity described in Xenopus oocytes (Bass, B.L., and Weintraub, H. (1987) Cell 48, 607-613) and from the p68 HeLa RNA helicase (Hirling, H., Scheffner, M., Restle, T., and Stahl, H. (1989) Nature 339, 562-564)."
https://openalex.org/W1545352687,"The efficiencies of rho action as a termination factor during transcription in vitro of several DNA templates were determined as a function of the concentration and type of electrolyte ions. The termination efficiencies with lambda-tR1 and the promoter proximal lacZ intragenic terminators were significantly higher with 0.1-0.2 M potassium glutamate as the major electrolyte than with the optimal concentrations of KCl (approximately 0.05 M) or potassium acetate (approximately 0.15 M). Similar high efficiencies were obtained with salts of other acidic amino acids but not with a salt of N-acetylglutamic acid or with a mixture of 0.15 M potassium acetate and 0.15 M glycine, and termination was inhibited completely when 0.12 M KCl was present along with 0.12 M potassium glutamate. The salts that give high termination efficiencies have two properties in common; they consist of anions that are also zwitterions, and they are weak chelators of Mg2+ ions. The increase in termination efficiency with potassium glutamate can be ascribed mainly to a facilitation of the reactions of rho with RNA that are coupled to ATP hydrolysis, as the rate of ATP hydrolysis with isolated transcripts as cofactors was about five times higher with 0.15 M potassium glutamate than with 0.05 M KCl, whereas the rates of chain elongation, the general stability of the transcription complexes, and the binding affinity of rho with the transcripts were all very similar under the two conditions. Further analysis revealed that the activation of ATP hydrolysis is an outcome of a shift in the optimum magnesium salt concentration from 0.5 mM with 0.05 M KCl to 4 mM with 0.15 M potassium glutamate. Since glutamate is a relatively weak counterion for cationic groups in proteins, potassium glutamate can be used at 0.15 M without inhibiting the binding of rho to RNA. At that concentration, it serves to buffer the level of free Mg2+ available to stabilize RNA secondary structures that are known to impede rho action on RNA. The two special properties of glutamate together create conditions that allow rho to terminate transcription in vitro at an efficiency that matches the in vivo efficiency with use of a physiological level of K+ ions."
https://openalex.org/W1602076093,"Inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) activity abrogated interleukin 2 (IL2) production by mitogen-stimulated human T lymphocytes. This effect was due partially to a 50% decrease in IL2 gene expression. However, when PKC inhibitors were added after IL2 gene transcription had already proceeded for 3-4 h, the IL2 in the culture supernatants was still reduced by 30-80%, and intracellular IL2 was increased by up to 50%. The inhibition of PKC affected the expression of IL2 receptors by these cells differently; it had little effect on gene expression or on the membrane-bound form of the receptor, but it decreased soluble receptors in the supernatants by 50-80%. These data indicate that in addition to its previously defined role in gene expression, PKC can also regulate extracellular secretion of proteins critical for T cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1566790537,"The 5'-flanking regions of the two low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor genes in Xenopus laevis contain three repeat sequences that are virtually identical to the repeats that mediate sterol-regulated transcription of the human LDL receptor gene. Like their human counterparts, Xenopus repeats 1 and 3, but not repeat 2, bind the transcription factor Sp1 and thus probably function as positive transcription elements. Xenopus repeat 2, like human repeat 2, contains all of the nucleotides that are required for sterol regulation. Administration of sterols repressed Xenopus LDL receptor mRNA in cultured A6 kidney cells and in the liver of intact frogs. In frogs this repression was associated with a 2-fold increase in plasma LDL levels. Xenopus LDL contains a protein corresponding in size to human apoB-100, a ligand for the LDL receptor. We found no evidence that frog plasma contains B-48, nor did we observe a clear-cut protein corresponding to apoE. We conclude that the structural gene for the LDL receptor has been under sterol-mediated regulation at least since the time of amphibian development more than 350 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1590355627,"Rat alpha 1-inhibitor-3 is a 180-kDa monomeric proteinase inhibitor found in high concentration in rat plasma. By several criteria it has been shown to be a member of the family of alpha-macroglobulin proteinase inhibitors often exemplified by the tetrameric human alpha 2-macroglobulin. We have used limited proteolysis of rat alpha 1-inhibitor-3 to probe the domain structure of this family of proteins. Proteinases of different specificities, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase, were employed and a common fragmentation pattern was observed when the reaction products were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These fragments were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis in order to position them within the context of the primary structure. The fragmentation pattern may define the domain structure of alpha 1-inhibitor-3 and serve as a model for the domain organization of the family of alpha-macroglobulin proteinase inhibitors."
