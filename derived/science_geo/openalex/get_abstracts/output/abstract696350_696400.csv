https://openalex.org/W4284883196,"Abstract DNA is naturally well suited to serve as a digital medium for in vivo molecular recording. However, contemporary DNA-based memory devices are constrained in terms of the number of distinct ‘symbols’ that can be concurrently recorded and/or by a failure to capture the order in which events occur 1 . Here we describe DNA Typewriter, a general system for in vivo molecular recording that overcomes these and other limitations. For DNA Typewriter, the blank recording medium (‘DNA Tape’) consists of a tandem array of partial CRISPR–Cas9 target sites, with all but the first site truncated at their 5′ ends and therefore inactive. Short insertional edits serve as symbols that record the identity of the prime editing guide RNA 2 mediating the edit while also shifting the position of the ‘type guide’ by one unit along the DNA Tape, that is, sequential genome editing. In this proof of concept of DNA Typewriter, we demonstrate recording and decoding of thousands of symbols, complex event histories and short text messages; evaluate the performance of dozens of orthogonal tapes; and construct ‘long tape’ potentially capable of recording as many as 20 serial events. Finally, we leverage DNA Typewriter in conjunction with single-cell RNA-seq to reconstruct a monophyletic lineage of 3,257 cells and find that the Poisson-like accumulation of sequential edits to multicopy DNA tape can be maintained across at least 20 generations and 25 days of in vitro clonal expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3215065993,"Abstract Quantum networks promise to provide the infrastructure for many disruptive applications, such as efficient long-distance quantum communication and distributed quantum computing 1,2 . Central to these networks is the ability to distribute entanglement between distant nodes using photonic channels. Initially developed for quantum teleportation 3,4 and loophole-free tests of Bell’s inequality 5,6 , recently, entanglement distribution has also been achieved over telecom fibres and analysed retrospectively 7,8 . Yet, to fully use entanglement over long-distance quantum network links it is mandatory to know it is available at the nodes before the entangled state decays. Here we demonstrate heralded entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms generated over fibre links with a length up to 33 km. For this, we generate atom–photon entanglement in two nodes located in buildings 400 m line-of-sight apart and to overcome high-attenuation losses in the fibres convert the photons to telecom wavelength using polarization-preserving quantum frequency conversion 9 . The long fibres guide the photons to a Bell-state measurement setup in which a successful photonic projection measurement heralds the entanglement of the atoms 10 . Our results show the feasibility of entanglement distribution over telecom fibre links useful, for example, for device-independent quantum key distribution 11–13 and quantum repeater protocols. The presented work represents an important step towards the realization of large-scale quantum network links."
https://openalex.org/W4284879667,"Nitrogen (N2) fixation by nature, which is a crucial process for the supply of bio-available forms of nitrogen, is performed by nitrogenase. This enzyme uses a unique transition-metal-sulfur-carbon cluster as its active-site co-factor ([(R-homocitrate)MoFe7S9C], FeMoco)1,2, and the sulfur-surrounded iron (Fe) atoms have been postulated to capture and reduce N2 (refs. 3-6). Although there are a few examples of synthetic counterparts of the FeMoco, metal-sulfur cluster, which have shown binding of N2 (refs. 7-9), the reduction of N2 by any synthetic metal-sulfur cluster or by the extracted form of FeMoco10 has remained elusive, despite nearly 50 years of research. Here we show that the Fe atoms in our synthetic [Mo3S4Fe] cubes11,12 can capture a N2 molecule and catalyse N2 silylation to form N(SiMe3)3 under treatment with excess sodium and trimethylsilyl chloride. These results exemplify the catalytic silylation of N2 by a synthetic metal-sulfur cluster and demonstrate the N2-reduction capability of Fe atoms in a sulfur-rich environment, which is reminiscent of the ability of FeMoco to bind and activate N2."
https://openalex.org/W4284891273,"Strychnine is a natural product that, through isolation, structural elucidation and synthetic efforts, shaped the field of organic chemistry. Currently, strychnine is used as a pesticide to control rodents1 because of its potent neurotoxicity2,3. The polycyclic architecture of strychnine has inspired chemists to develop new synthetic transformations and strategies to access this molecular scaffold4, yet it is still unknown how plants create this complex structure. Here we report the biosynthetic pathway of strychnine, along with the related molecules brucine and diaboline. Moreover, we successfully recapitulate strychnine, brucine and diaboline biosynthesis in Nicotiana benthamiana from an upstream intermediate, thus demonstrating that this complex, pharmacologically active class of compounds can now be harnessed through metabolic engineering approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4284884444,"Precise signalling between pollen tubes and synergid cells in the ovule initiates fertilization in flowering plants1. Contact of the pollen tube with the ovule triggers calcium spiking in the synergids2,3 that induces pollen tube rupture and sperm release. This process, termed pollen tube reception, entails the action of three synergid-expressed proteins in Arabidopsis: FERONIA (FER), a receptor-like kinase; LORELEI (LRE), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein; and NORTIA (NTA), a transmembrane protein of unknown function4-6. Genetic analyses have placed these three proteins in the same pathway; however, it remains unknown how they work together to enable synergid-pollen tube communication. Here we identify two pollen-tube-derived small peptides7 that belong to the rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) family8 as ligands for the FER-LRE co-receptor, which in turn recruits NTA to the plasma membrane. NTA functions as a calmodulin-gated calcium channel required for calcium spiking in the synergid. We also reconstitute the biochemical pathway in which FER-LRE perceives pollen-tube-derived peptides to activate the NTA calcium channel and initiate calcium spiking, a second messenger for pollen tube reception. The FER-LRE-NTA trio therefore forms a previously unanticipated receptor-channel complex in the female cell to recognize male signals and trigger the fertilization process."
https://openalex.org/W4284884489,"How quasars powered by supermassive black holes formed less than a billion years after the Big Bang is still one of the outstanding problems in astrophysics, 20 years after their discovery1-4. Cosmological simulations suggest that rare cold flows converging on primordial haloes in low-shear environments could have created these quasars if they were 104-105 solar masses at birth, but could not resolve their formation5-8. Semi-analytical studies of the progenitor halo of a primordial quasar found that it favours the formation of such seeds, but could not verify if one actually appeared9. Here we show that a halo at the rare convergence of strong, cold accretion flows creates massive black holes seeds without the need for ultraviolet backgrounds, supersonic streaming motions or even atomic cooling. Cold flows drive violent, supersonic turbulence in the halo, which prevents star formation until it reaches a mass that triggers sudden, catastrophic baryon collapse that forms 31,000 and 40,000 solar-mass stars. This simple, robust process ensures that haloes capable of forming quasars by a redshift of z > 6 produce massive seeds. The first quasars were thus a natural consequence of structure formation in cold dark matter cosmologies, and not exotic, finely tuned environments as previously thought10-14."
https://openalex.org/W4285741060,"The occurrence and the antibiogram signatures of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) recovered from 65 milk samples and its products within the Eastern Cape province were examined. The EN ISO 11290:2017 procedures Parts 1 and 2 described by the International Organization for Standardization for the enumeration and isolation of Lm was adopted for the study. Lm was detected in 18.46% of all the samples examined, and the strains recovered from the samples belong to serotypes 4b and 1/2b. The virulence determinants including prfA, plcA, plcB, inlA, inlC, hly, mpl, actA, inlJ and inlB were detected in all the isolates. About 95.24% of the studied Lm isolates demonstrated potential capacity for biofilm formation. The antibiogram profile revealed high resistance against sulfamethoxazole (71.43%), trimethoprim (52.86%); erythromycin, cefotetan and oxytetracycline (42.86% respectively). About 85.71% exhibited multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes against the test antibiotics. The resistance determinants encoding resistance against the β-lactamase antibiotics [such as the blaTEM, blaSHV, blaTEM variants (TEM-1 and TEM-2) and the blaZ], the tetracycline resistance genes (including tetA, tetD, tetG and tetM and tetK) were detected among resistant isolates. In addition, the aminoglycoside resistance gene aph (3)-IIa (aphA2)a was detected only in one isolate. Finally, the sulfonamide resistance genes including the sul2 and the sul1 genes were the most frequently observed among Lm isolates. Generally, 71.43% of all Lm isolates recovered from the samples investigated harboured one or more resistance genes encoding resistance against various antibiotics. The antibiogram signatures of Lm isolates observed in this study is an indication that empirical treatment of listeriosis may be challenging in the future as the pathogen may obliterate the success of antibiotics. We, therefore, advocate for the recognition of the One Health approach to ensuring food safety and curbing the spread of antimicrobial resistance in food."
https://openalex.org/W4284685525,"Vortices are the hallmarks of hydrodynamic flow. Strongly interacting electrons in ultrapure conductors can display signatures of hydrodynamic behaviour, including negative non-local resistance1-4, higher-than-ballistic conduction5-7, Poiseuille flow in narrow channels8-10 and violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law11. Here we provide a visualization of whirlpools in an electron fluid. By using a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device on a tip12, we image the current distribution in a circular chamber connected through a small aperture to a current-carrying strip in the high-purity type II Weyl semimetal WTe2. In this geometry, the Gurzhi momentum diffusion length and the size of the aperture determine the vortex stability phase diagram. We find that vortices are present for only small apertures, whereas the flow is laminar (non-vortical) for larger apertures. Near the vortical-to-laminar transition, we observe the single vortex in the chamber splitting into two vortices; this behaviour is expected only in the hydrodynamic regime and is not anticipated for ballistic transport. These findings suggest a new mechanism of hydrodynamic flow in thin pure crystals such that the spatial diffusion of electron momenta is enabled by small-angle scattering at the surfaces instead of the routinely invoked electron-electron scattering, which becomes extremely weak at low temperatures. This surface-induced para-hydrodynamics, which mimics many aspects of conventional hydrodynamics including vortices, opens new possibilities for exploring and using electron fluidics in high-mobility electron systems."
https://openalex.org/W4283835017,"Abstract The transcription factor, forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), has been implicated in the natural history and outcome of newly diagnosed high-risk myeloma (HRMM) and relapsed/refractory myeloma (RRMM), but the mechanism with which FOXM1 promotes the growth of neoplastic plasma cells is poorly understood. Here we show that FOXM1 is a positive regulator of myeloma metabolism that greatly impacts the bioenergetic pathways of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Using FOXM1-deficient myeloma cells as principal experimental model system, we find that FOXM1 increases glucose uptake, lactate output, and oxygen consumption in myeloma. We demonstrate that the novel 1,1-diarylethylene small-compound FOXM1 inhibitor, NB73, suppresses myeloma in cell culture and human-in-mouse xenografts using a mechanism that includes enhanced proteasomal FOXM1 degradation. Consistent with the FOXM1-stabilizing chaperone function of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), the HSP90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, collaborates with NB73 in slowing down myeloma. These findings define FOXM1 as a key driver of myeloma metabolism and underscore the feasibility of targeting FOXM1 for new approaches to myeloma therapy and prevention."

https://openalex.org/W4284885463,"Electric control of magnetism and magnetic control of ferroelectricity can improve the energy efficiency of magnetic memory and data-processing devices1. However, the necessary magnetoelectric switching is hard to achieve, and requires more than just a coupling between the spin and the charge degrees of freedom2-5. Here we show that an application and subsequent removal of a magnetic field reverses the electric polarization of the multiferroic GdMn2O5, thus requiring two cycles to bring the system back to the original configuration. During this unusual hysteresis loop, four states with different magnetic configurations are visited by the system, with one half of all spins undergoing unidirectional full-circle rotation in increments of about 90 degrees. Therefore, GdMn2O5 acts as a magnetic crankshaft that converts the back-and-forth variations of the magnetic field into a circular spin motion. This peculiar four-state magnetoelectric switching emerges as a topologically protected boundary between different two-state switching regimes. Our findings establish a paradigm of topologically protected switching phenomena in ferroic materials."
https://openalex.org/W4285744425,"The global energy system has a relatively small land footprint at present, comprising just 0.4% of ice-free land. This pales in comparison to agricultural land use- 30-38% of ice-free land-yet future low-carbon energy systems that shift to more extensive technologies could dramatically alter landscapes around the globe. The challenge is more acute given the projected doubling of global energy consumption by 2050 and widespread electrification of transportation and industry. Yet unlike greenhouse gas emissions, land use intensity of energy has been rarely studied in a rigorous way. Here we calculate land-use intensity of energy (LUIE) for real-world sites across all major sources of electricity, integrating data from published literature, databases, and original data collection. We find a range of LUIE that span four orders of magnitude, from nuclear with 7.1 ha/TWh/y to dedicated biomass at 58,000 ha/TWh/y. By applying these LUIE results to the future electricity portfolios of ten energy scenarios, we conclude that land use could become a significant constraint on deep decarbonization of the power system, yet low-carbon, land-efficient options are available."
https://openalex.org/W4283826056,"When deciding what to eat, animals evaluate sensory information about food quality alongside multiple ongoing internal states1–10. How internal states interact to alter sensorimotor processing and shape decisions such as food choice remains poorly understood. Here we use pan-neuronal volumetric activity imaging in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the neuronal basis of internal state-dependent nutrient appetites. We created a functional atlas of the ventral fly brain and find that metabolic state shapes sensorimotor processing across large sections of the neuropil. By contrast, reproductive state acts locally to define how sensory information is translated into feeding motor output. These two states thus synergistically modulate protein-specific food intake and food choice. Finally, using a novel computational strategy, we identify driver lines that label neurons innervating state-modulated brain regions and show that the newly identified ‘borboleta’ region is sufficient to direct food choice towards protein-rich food. We thus identify a generalizable principle by which distinct internal states are integrated to shape decision making and propose a strategy to uncover and functionally validate how internal states shape behaviour. High-resolution volumetric calcium imaging was used to create a functional atlas of the Drosophila melanogaster ventral brain and identify how and where metabolic and reproductive states alter processing of food-related sensory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W4285743140,"Introduction The Covid-19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on healthcare but uncertainty remains about the extent to which primary care provision was affected. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the impact on primary care provision and the evolution of the incidence of disease during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic in Flanders (Belgium). Methods Care provision was defined as the number of new entries added to a patient’s medical history. Pre-pandemic care provision (February 1, 2018–January 31, 2020) was compared with care provision during the pandemic (February 1, 2020-January 31, 2021). A large morbidity registry (Intego) was used. Regression models compared the effect of demographic characteristics on care provision and on acute and chronic diagnoses incidence both prior and during the pandemic. Results During the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, overall care provision increased with 9.1% (95%CI 8.5%;9.6%). There was an increase in acute diagnoses of 5.1% (95%CI 4.2%;6.0%) and a decrease in the selected chronic diagnoses of 12.8% (95% CI 7.0%;18.4%). Obesity was an exception with an overall incidence increase. The pandemic led to strong fluctuations in care provision that were not the same for all types of care and all demographic groups in Flanders. Relative to other groups in the population, the pandemic caused a reduction in care provision for children aged 0–17 year and patients from a lower socio-economic situation. Conclusion This paper strengthened the claim that Covid-19 should be considered as a syndemic instead of a pandemic. During the first Covid-19 year, overall care provision and the incidence of acute diagnoses increased, whereas chronic diseases’ incidence decreased, except for obesity diagnoses which increased. More granular, care provision and chronic diseases’ incidence decreased during the lockdowns, especially for people with a lower socio-economic status. After the lockdowns they both returned to baseline."
https://openalex.org/W4285744919,"Studying land use change in protected areas (PAs) located in tropical forests is a major conservation priority due to high conservation value (e.g., species richness and carbon storage) here, coupled with generally high deforestation rates. Land use change researchers use a variety of land cover products to track deforestation trends, including maps they produce themselves and readily available products, such as the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset. However, all land cover maps should be critically assessed for limitations and biases to accurately communicate and interpret results. In this study, we assess deforestation in PA complexes located in agricultural frontiers in the Amazon Basin. We studied three specific sites: Amboró and Carrasco National Parks in Bolivia, Jamanxim National Forest in Brazil, and Tambopata National Reserve and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park in Peru. Within and in 20km buffer areas around each complex, we generated land cover maps using composites of Landsat imagery and supervised classification, and compared deforestation trends to data from the GFC dataset. We then performed a dissimilarity analysis to explore the discrepancies between the two remote sensing products. Both the GFC and our supervised classification showed that deforestation rates were higher in the 20km buffer than inside the PAs and that Jamanxim National Forest had the highest deforestation rate of the PAs we studied. However, GFC maps showed consistently higher rates of deforestation than our maps. Through a dissimilarity analysis, we found that many of the inconsistencies between these datasets arise from different treatment of mixed pixels or different parameters in map creation (for example, GFC does not detect reforestation after 2012). We found that our maps underestimated deforestation while GFC overestimated deforestation, and that true deforestation rates likely fall between our two estimates. We encourage users to consider limitations and biases when using or interpreting our maps, which we make publicly available, and GFC’s maps."
https://openalex.org/W4285745010,"Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, older adults living alone, who can only connect socially outside their homes, are at risk of social isolation and poor mental health. This study aimed to identify the changes, before and after COVID-19, by sex and age, in social relationships (social activity, social network, and social support) and mental health (depression and suicide ideation) among older adults living alone.This is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older adults who were at least 65 years old and living alone in South Korea. The study was conducted during 2018-2020 with 2,291 participants (795, 771, and 725 for the 1st to 3rd waves, respectively). The data were collected via face-to-face interviews. A generalized linear mixed modeling framework was used to test for changes over three years.Social activity was reduced after the COVID-19, with an interaction effect of sex: older women (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.23; p < .001) showed greater reduction than older men (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34-0.75; p < .001). Interaction with neighbors also reduced after the pandemic, but there was no significant evidence of interaction effects. Interaction with family members increased in both sexes during the pandemic, with the interaction effect of sex: older women (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11-1.76; p = .004) showed greater increase than men (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.13-2.14; p = .007). Social support increased in both sexes during the pandemic, but there was no significant evidence of interaction effects. Depression and suicide ideation showed no significant differences before and after the pandemic.The findings provide health administrators and health providers with explorative insights into the impact of the COVID-19 on social relationships and mental health among older adults living alone and can guide further studies of interventions considering specific properties of social relationships."
https://openalex.org/W4284885910,"Insects, unlike vertebrates, are widely believed to lack male-biased sex steroid hormones1. In the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the ecdysteroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) appears to have evolved to both control egg development when synthesized by females2 and to induce mating refractoriness when sexually transferred by males3. Because egg development and mating are essential reproductive traits, understanding how Anopheles females integrate these hormonal signals can spur the design of new malaria control programs. Here we reveal that these reproductive functions are regulated by distinct sex steroids through a sophisticated network of ecdysteroid-activating/inactivating enzymes. We identify a male-specific oxidized ecdysteroid, 3-dehydro-20E (3D20E), which safeguards paternity by turning off female sexual receptivity following its sexual transfer and activation by dephosphorylation. Notably, 3D20E transfer also induces expression of a reproductive gene that preserves egg development during Plasmodium infection, ensuring fitness of infected females. Female-derived 20E does not trigger sexual refractoriness but instead licenses oviposition in mated individuals once a 20E-inhibiting kinase is repressed. Identifying this male-specific insect steroid hormone and its roles in regulating female sexual receptivity, fertility and interactions with Plasmodium parasites suggests the possibility for reducing the reproductive success of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W4285411168,"Small populations of the endangered species are more vulnerable to extinction and hence require periodic genetic monitoring to establish and revisit the conservation strategies. The Amur leopard is critically endangered with about 100 individuals in the wild. In this study, we developed a simple and cost-effective noninvasive genetic monitoring protocol for Amur leopards. Also, we investigated the impact of fecal sample's age, storage, and collection season on microsatellite genotyping success and data quality. We identified 89 leopard scats out of the 342 fecal samples collected from Land of the Leopard between 2014-2019. Microsatellite genotyping using 12 markers optimized in 3 multiplex PCR reactions reveals presence of at least 24 leopard individuals (18 males and 6 females). There was a significant difference in the success rate of genotyping depending on the time from feces deposition to collection (p = 0.014, Fisher's exact test), with better genotyping success for samples having <2 weeks of environmental exposure. Amur leopard genetic diversity was found low (Ho- 0.33, HE- 0.35, and NA- 2.57) with no visible population substructure and recent bottleneck signature. Although a historical bottleneck footprint was observed. Mitochondrial DNA diversity was also found low with two haplotypes differing by a point mutation reported in 1,769 bp of investigated sequence covering parts of cytochrome b gene (846 bp), NADH-5 gene (611 bp) and control region (312 bp). We recommend periodic genetic monitoring of wild Amur leopards following the proposed methodology to achieve cost effectiveness and efficiency."

In the Partnership for Research on Ebola VACcinations extended follow-UP and clinical research capacity build-UP (PREVAC-UP) study being undertaken in Mambolo, northern Sierra Leone, participants are being followed up to assess the potential impact of exposure to malaria and/or helminth infections on long-term immune response to two Ebola vaccines. To support the development of the assays that will be used in this evaluation, a parasitological survey was conducted in Mambolo between November 2019 and February 2020.Healthy individuals aged ≥1 year who were resident in Mambolo Chiefdom were selected using a stratified sampling approach and questionnaires were administered to explore their sociodemographic characteristics. Microscopy was used to detect malaria parasites, intestinal helminths and urinary schistosome infections. Rapid blood tests were used to detect infections with Onchocerca volvulus and Wuchereria bancrofti. We estimated the overall prevalence of these infections and used adjusted logistic regression models to explore risk factors for malaria and hookworm infection.Eight hundred and fifteen (815) residents, 50.9% of whom were female were surveyed. Overall, 309 (39.1%) of 791 persons tested for malaria had a positive blood slide; Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant species. Helminth infection was detected in 122 (15.0%) of 815 stool samples including three mixed infections. The helminth infections comprised 102 (12.5%) cases of hookworm, 11 (1.3%) cases of Trichuris trichiura, 10 (1.2%) cases of Schistosoma mansoni and two (0.2%) cases of Ascaris lumbricoides. Being male (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.15-3.50) and residing in a non-riverine community (OR = 4.02, 95%CI 2.32-6.98) were the factors associated with hookworm infection. Onchocerca volvulus and Wuchereria bancrofti infections were found in 3.3% and 0.4% of participants respectively.Malaria and hookworm are the most prevalent parasite infections and those most likely to influence long-term immune response to Ebola vaccines among the trial participants."
https://openalex.org/W4285740539,"Water and nitrogen availability are two major environmental factors that can impair plant growth, and when combined, their effects on plant performance can be either intensified or reduced. The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of nitrogen availability on the responses of Amaranthus cruentus's metabolism to water stress. The plants were cultivated in plastic pots filled with vermiculite, kept under greenhouse conditions, and were watered three times a week with 70% of a full strength nitrogen-free Long Ashton solution, containing 1.97 or 9.88 kg N ha-1 as ammonium nitrate. Photosynthetic parameters were evaluated in planta, and leaves were harvested for chemical analysis of photosynthetic pigments, proline, and phenolic contents. Higher nitrogen supply increased the shoot dry matter, photosynthetic pigments, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, total leaf nitrogen, proline, nitrate, and ammonium but reduced the concentration of flavonoids and total phenols. Six days of water stress did not affect dry matter, photosynthetic pigments, leaf nitrogen, ammonium, or specialized metabolites but increased the proline under high nitrogen and negatively affected stomatal conductance, transpiration, photosynthesis, relative water content, instantaneous water use efficiency, and leaf nitrate. The negative effect was more pronounced under high nitrogen supply. The results show that the addition of a high amount of nitrogen made the physiological processes of plants more sensitive to water stress, indicating that the plant response to water restriction depends on the interaction between the different environmental stressors to which the plants are subjected."
https://openalex.org/W4285741188,"Birdwatching is considered one of the fastest growing nature-based tourism sectors in the world. Tourists who identify as birdwatchers tend to be well-educated and wealthy travellers with a specific interest in the places they visit. Birdwatchers can bring economic resources to remote communities diversifying their economies and contribute to biodiversity conservation in areas of bird habitat with global significance. Alaska plays a critical role in understanding the link between bird conservation and bird tourism as it supports the world’s largest concentration of shorebirds and is a global breeding hotspot for hundreds of migratory species, including many species of conservation concern for their decline across their ranges. Alaska is also a global destination for birders due to the large congregations of birds that occur during the spring, summer and fall seasons. Despite its global importance, relatively little information exists on the significance of bird tourism in Alaska or on opportunities for community development that align with conservation. This study used ebird data to look at trends in Alaska birdwatching and applied existing information from the Alaska Visitor Statistics Program to estimate visitor expenditures and the impact of that spending on Alaska’s regional economies. In 2016, nearly 300,000 birdwatchers visited Alaska and spent $378 million, supporting approximately 4,000 jobs. The study describes bird tourism’s contributions to local jobs and income in remote rural and urban economies and discusses opportunities for developing and expanding the nature-based tourism sector. The study points toward the importance of partnering with rural communities and landowners to advance both economic opportunities and biodiversity conservation actions. The need for new data collection addressing niche market development and economic diversification is also discussed."

Moreover, in September 2020, new variant cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were reported in the United Kingdom, with many patients and deaths. This study aimed to see knowledge, perception, and fear among the global population towards a new variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, known as Omicron (B.1.1.529). This online cross-sectional global study was conducted during the emergence of the B.1.1.529 variant, also known as the Omicron variant. The survey was carried out from 2nd December 2021 to 3rd January 2022. The descriptive analysis was presented as frequencies (N), percentages (%), and mean ± standard deviation (m ± SD). The association between dependent and categorical independent variables was determined using the Chi-square test (x2). Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS version 23. Of 353 respondents, approximately 61% were females. One hundred fifty-four respondents were in the age group of 18-27 years. The average age was 31.53±10.3 (mean± SD). The majority of respondents (43.9%) were from Indonesia. The mean knowledge score about the Omicron variant was 3.18±1.14. Our study suggests that people have some knowledge about the new variant, Omicron (B.1.1.529). Besides, there was a significant association (p = 0.05) for the perception of the fatality rate of Omicron among the respondents from different countries. However, there is still an ample research gap in enlightening people about this infection (B.1.1.529)."

Due to the high genetic clonality of B . mallei , high-resolution typing assays are necessary to differentiate between individual strains. Here we report on the development and validation of a robust and reproducible core genome-based Multi Locus Sequence Typing Assay (cgMLST) for B . mallei , which is based on 3328 gene targets and enables high-resolution typing at the strain level. The assay was validated using a set of 120 B . mallei genomes from public databases and 23 newly sequenced outbreak strains from in-house strain collections. In this cgMLST analysis, strains from different geographic regions were clearly distinguished by at least 70 allele differences, allowing spatial clustering while closely related and epidemiologically related strains were separated by only zero to three alleles. Neither the different sequencing technologies nor the assembly strategies had an influence on the cgMLST results. The developed cgMLST is highly robust, reproducible and can be used for outbreak investigations, source tracking and molecular characterization of new B . mallei isolates."
https://openalex.org/W4284897794,"Individuals can exhibit differences in metabolism that are caused by the interplay of genetic background, nutritional input, microbiota and other environmental factors1–4. It is difficult to connect differences in metabolism to genomic variation and derive underlying molecular mechanisms in humans, owing to differences in diet and lifestyle, among others. Here we use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study inter-individual variation in metabolism. By comparing three wild strains and the commonly used N2 laboratory strain, we find differences in the abundances of both known metabolites and those that have not to our knowledge been previously described. The latter metabolites include conjugates between 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) and several amino acids (3HP-AAs), which are much higher in abundance in one of the wild strains. 3HP is an intermediate in the propionate shunt pathway, which is activated when flux through the canonical, vitamin-B12-dependent propionate breakdown pathway is perturbed5. We show that increased accumulation of 3HP-AAs is caused by genetic variation in HPHD-1, for which 3HP is a substrate. Our results suggest that the production of 3HP-AAs represents a ‘shunt-within-a-shunt’ pathway to accommodate a reduction-of-function allele in hphd-1. This study provides a step towards the development of metabolic network models that capture individual-specific differences of metabolism and more closely represent the diversity that is found in entire species. Using differences among strains as a model for inter-individual variation, this paper identifies a conserved metabolicadaptation in C. elegans that compensates for genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W4285412886,"A maternal high-fat diet (HFD) can impact the offspring's development of liver steatosis, with fetal development in utero being a crucial period. Therefore, this study investigated the mechanism and whether butyrate can rescue liver injury caused by maternal HFD in the fetus. Pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups, prenatal HFD (58% fat) exposure or normal control diet (4.5% fat). The HFD group was fed an HFD 7 weeks before mating and during gestation until sacrifice at gestation 21 days. After confirmation of mating, the other HFD group was supplemented with sodium butyrate (HFSB). The results showed that maternal liver histology showed lipid accumulation with steatosis and shortened ileum villi in HFD, which was ameliorated in the HFSB group (P<0.05). There was increased fetal liver and ileum TUNEL staining and IL-6 expression with increased fetal liver TNF-α and malondialdehyde expression in the HFD group (P<0.05), which decreased in the HFSB group (P<0.05). The fetal liver expression of phospho-AKT/AKT and GPX1 decreased in the HFD group but increased in the HFSB group (P<0.05). In conclusion that oxidative stress with inflammation and apoptosis plays a vital role after maternal HFD in the fetus liver that can be ameliorated with butyrate supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W4285740030,"The modeling of security threats is equally important as the modeling of functional requirements at the design stage of software engineering. However, unlike functional requirements modeling, the modeling of security threats is neglected, which consequently introduces software defects during the early stages of software engineering. Hence, there is a need to mitigate these threats at the design stage. Security threats, specifically authentication threats, crosscut other functional and non-functional requirements when modeled using the object-oriented paradigm. This not only makes the design complex but also results in tangling and scattering problems. We therefore model authentication threats using the aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) technique since it separates crosscutting concerns and localizes them as separate units called aspects. Our main research aim is to remove scattering and tangling in security threats modeling using all the core features of the aspect-oriented technique. In this paper, we propose a research approach to model security threats and their mitigation in mal sequence diagram. Using this approach, our contribution makes a clear difference from previous work. Our first contribution is the modeling of authentication threats in the mal sequence diagram using the security profile and AOM profile. Our second contribution is the mathematical verification of the aspect-oriented mal sequence woven model in terms of correctness and completeness. Using the proposed approach, the scattering and tangling from the resultant woven model are successfully removed at the design stage. Thus, the complexity of models and the time and effort required for future modifications of design models are reduced."
https://openalex.org/W4285741443,"Even though formal education is considered a key determinant of individual well-being globally, enrollment in secondary schooling remains low in many low- and middle-income countries, suggesting that the perceived returns to such schooling may be low. We jointly estimate survival and monetary benefits of secondary schooling using detailed demographic and surveillance data from the Boucle du Mouhoun region, Burkina Faso, where national upper secondary schooling completion rates are among the lowest globally (<10%). We first explore surveillance data from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System from 1992 to 2016 to determine long-term differences in survival outcomes between secondary and higher and primary schooling using Cox proportional hazards models. To estimate average increases in asset holdings associated with secondary schooling, we use regionally representative data from the Burkina Faso Demographic Health Surveys (2003, 2010, 2014, 2017-18; N = 3,924). Survival was tracked for 14,892 individuals. Each year of schooling was associated with a mortality reduction of up to 16% (95% CI 0.75-0.94), implying an additional 1.9 years of life expectancy for men and 5.1 years for women for secondary schooling compared to individuals completing only primary school. Relative to individuals with primary education, individuals with secondary or higher education held 26% more assets (SE 0.02; CI 0.22-0.30). Economic returns for women were 3% points higher than male returns with 10% (SE 0.03; CI 0.04-0.16) vs. 7% (SE 0.02; CI 0.02-0.012) and in rural areas 20% points higher than in urban areas with 30% (SE 0.06; CI 0.19-0.41) vs. 4% (SE 0.01; CI 0.02-0.07). Our results suggest that secondary education is associated with substantial health and economic benefits in the study area and should therefore be considered by researchers, governments, and other major stakeholders to create for example school promotion programs."

The highest prevalence of anemia is in developing countries. The complete blood count is a blood test used to diagnose the prevalence of anemia. While earlier studies have framed the problem of diagnosis as a binary classification problem, this paper frames it as a multi class (three classes) classification problem with mild, moderate and severe classes. The three classes for the anemia classification (mild, moderate, severe) are so chosen as the world health organization (WHO) guidelines formalize this categorization based on the Haemoglobin (HGB) values of the chosen sample of patients in the Complete Blood Count (CBC) patient data set. Complete blood count test data was collected in an outpatient clinical setting in India. We used Feature selection with Majority voting to identify the key attributes in the input patient data set. In addition, since the original data set was imbalanced we used Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data set. Four data sets including the original data set were used to perform the data experiments. Six standard machine learning algorithms were utilised to test our four data sets, performing multi class classification. Benchmarking these algorithms was performed and tabulated using both10 fold cross validation and hold out methods. The experimental results indicated that multilayer perceptron network was predominantly giving good recall values across mild and moderate class which are early and middle stages of the disease. With a good prediction model at early stages, medical intervention can provide preventive measure from further deterioration into severe stage or recommend the use of supplements to overcome this problem."
https://openalex.org/W4285745095,"Euryhaline teleosts can survive in environments with different salinities. Cortisol is an important hormone for acclimation to seawater (SW) of euryhaline teleosts. Osmotic stress transcription factor 1 (OSTF1), also called the transforming growth factor-beta stimulated clone 22 domain 3 (tsc22d3), was first reported in tilapia as an acute response gene and protein under hyperosmotic stress, and it is regulated by cortisol. To date, most studies on OSTF1 have focused on freshwater inhabitants, such as tilapia, medaka, and catadromous eel. The expression of OSTF1 and the correlation between OSTF1 and cortisol in marine inhabitant euryhaline teleosts, to our knowledge, remain unclear. This study reveals the changes in the expression levels of branchial OSTF1, plasma cortisol levels, and their correlation in the marine inhabitant milkfish with ambient salinities. The two sequences of milkfish TSC22D3 transcripts were classified as OSTF1a and OSTF1b. Both genes were expressed universally in all detected organs and tissues but were the most abundant in the liver. Similar gene expression levels of ostf1a and ostf1b were found in SW- and fresh water (FW)-acclimated milkfish gills, an important osmoregulatory organ. Within 12 hours of being transferred from FW to SW, the gene expression level of ostf1b increased significantly (4 folds) within 12 h, whereas the expression level of ostf1a remained constant. Moreover, cortisol levels increased rapidly after being transferred to a hyperosmotic environment. After an intraperitoneal injection of cortisol, the gene expression levels of ostf1a and ostf1b were elevated. However, under hyperosmotic stress, ostf1a gene expression remained stable. Overall, the results revealed that ostf1b was the primary gene in milkfish responding to hypertonic stress, and cortisol concentration increased after the transfer of milkfish from FW to SW. Furthermore, cortisol injection increased the expression of ostf1a and ostf1b. As a result, factors other than cortisol may activate ostf1b in milkfish gills in response to an environmental salinity challenge."

In this paper, we studied the urbanization development level, eco-environment development level, and their coupling coordinated development degree during 2005-2018 in the eastern Russia from the perspectives of the 3D global trend and 2D plane analysis. First, combining with the Population-Economic-Sociology and Pressure-State-Response models, the urbanization development level and eco-environment development level were calculated by the comprehensive weighting method of entropy weight and variation coefficient for eastern Russia. Second, the coupling coordinated development degree of the urbanization development level and eco-environment development level was measured by the coupling coordination model for eastern Russia. Finally, the spatial differentiation of the urbanization development level, the eco-environment development level and their coupling coordinated development degree was performed respectively by the 3D global trend and 2D plane analysis using ArcGIS. The results are as following. First, the comprehensive urbanization development level of eastern Russia has increased from 2005 to 2018, and the economic urbanization is the main factor that affects the urbanization development in eastern Russia. The comprehensive eco-environment development level of eastern Russia has decreased from 2005 to 2018, and the eco-environment pressure is the main factor that affects the eco-environment development in eastern Russia. The coupling coordination degree of the urbanization development and eco-environment development has increased from 2005 to 2018. However, it is still in the uncoordinated stage. Second, from 2005 to 2018, the urbanization development level of the Siberian Federal District is higher than that of the Far East Federal District. The eco-environment development level of the Siberian Federal District is balanced to that of the Far East Federal District. The coupling coordination degree of the Siberian Federal District is higher than that of the Far East Federal District. Among the Siberian and Far East Federal Districts, most of the federal subjects belong to the uncoordinated stage of the urbanization development and the eco-environment development. Third, the urbanization development level, the eco-environment development level, and their coupling coordinated development level are all spatially imbalanced in the eastern Russia, which show the ""High West, Low East"" and ""High Center, Low North and Low South"" spatial pattern from the perspectives of the 3D global trend and 2D plane analysis. The areas with high levels are concentrated in the Novosibirsk Region, Altay Territory, Kemerovo Region, Krasnoyarsk Territory, and Irkutsk Region. The areas with low ones are mostly in the Republic of Altay and Chukotka Autonomous Area. Finally, we suggest policies and strategies that can boost the growth and development of the urbanization and the eco-environment in the Sino-Russian border areas."

Historically, state-of-the-art approaches have been developed for and benchmarked against English datasets, while other languages have had to catch up and deal with inevitable linguistic challenges. This paper offers a survey with practical and linguistic connotations, showcasing the complications and challenges tied to the application of modern Text Classification algorithms to languages other than English. We engage this subject from the perspective of the Italian language, and we discuss in detail issues related to the scarcity of task-specific datasets, as well as the issues posed by the computational expensiveness of modern approaches. We substantiate this by providing an extensively researched list of available datasets in Italian, comparing it with a similarly sought list for French, which we use for comparison. In order to simulate a real-world practical scenario, we apply a number of representative methods to custom-tailored multilabel classification datasets in Italian, French, and English. We conclude by discussing results, future challenges, and research directions from a linguistically inclusive perspective."
https://openalex.org/W4285740204,"Background In Qatar, as in the rest of the world, the sharp rise in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a leading cause for concern, in terms associated with morbidity, mortality, and increasing health costs. Besides adhering to medication, the outcome of diabetes management is also dependent on patient adherence to the variable self-care behaviors including healthful eating (HE) and physical activity (PA). Yet, dietary intake and PA in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with T1D are known to fall short of recommended guidelines. The aim of this study was to develop an in-depth understanding of the behavioral determinants of HE and PA adherence among Arab AYAs within the age range of 17–24 years with T1D attending Hamad General Hospital. Methods Semi-structured, face-to-face individual interviews were conducted with 20 participants. Interviews were based on an integrative health behavior change model, the I-Change model (ICM). All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the framework method. Results More participants reported non-adherence than adherence. Several motivational determinants of adherence to HE and PA were identified. The majority of participants were cognizant of their own behaviors towards HE and PA. Yet, some did not link low adherence to HE and PA with increased risks of health problems resulting from T1D. Facilitators to adherence were identified as being convinced of the advantages of HE and PA, having support and high self-efficacy, a high level of intention, and a good health care system. Conclusion The suboptimal adherence in AYAs to HE and PA needs more attention. Supportive actions are needed to encourage adherence to a healthy lifestyle to achieve benefits in terms of glycemic control and overall health outcomes, with a special focus on adolescents. Interventions are needed to foster motivation by addressing the relevant determinants in order to promote adherence to these two behaviors in AYAs with T1D."

Nevertheless, Hangzhou’s business environment has shortcomings, such as insufficient technology, talent, and intelligent infrastructure. Two unresolved questions persist: (i) Has the smart business environment stimulated corporate investment by reducing system costs and boosting corporate confidence? (ii) How do the commercial climate’s shortcomings impact the relationship between the intelligent business environment and business costs/confidence? We examined the impact of a local smart business environment on the corporate investment scale in Hangzhou using factor analysis, cluster analysis, linear regression, and path analyses of data from 297 firm managers. Smart governance improved public administration, financing, and rule of law. The business environment promoted investment by increasing business confidence and decreasing institutional costs. Weak intelligent property protection and legal fairness hindered the positive influence of smart governance on business confidence and system costs. This is the first study combining business environment, smart city, and smart governance concepts to analyze the influence of local smart business environments on business confidence, institutional costs, and investment. Our conclusion on the limitation effect of intelligent business environment on enterprise investment attempts to inspire further research on the intersection of business environments and smart cities. The law of intelligent business environment attracting investment obtained in the context of China, the largest developing country with diversified economic development, is of great significance for other developing countries. Countries can attract investment and promote economic development through intelligent governance. Developing countries should construct smart service platforms, coordinate supervision of public credit, reduce financing constraint, construct a government under the rule of law, improve the quality of land management, and protect intellectual property rights."

Hitherto research indicate a close relationship between high-performance work systems and work fatigue, and there may be a double-edged sword effect of high-performance work systems on work fatigue. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework has not been developed to understand the relationship between them. Based on the challenge-hindrance stress model, this study employs role overload and job responsibility as mediating variables in a conceptual framework to understand the impact of high-performance work systems on work fatigue. Using the partial least square structural equation model and a sample of 360 employees in China, the mediating effects of role overload and job responsibility were confirmed. Further, the internal mechanisms of how high-performance work systems affect work fatigue are discussed, its adverse effects are confirmed, and its practical implications are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W4285739811,"Ants often interact with other invertebrates as predators or mutualists. Epiphytic bromeliads provide nesting sites for ants, and could increase ant abundances in the tree canopy. We surveyed ants in the foliage of orange trees that either hosted bromeliads or did not. To determine if observed associations between bromeliads and tree ants were causal, we removed bromeliads from half of the trees, and resurveyed ants six weeks later. Our results show that bromeliad presence is correlated with higher ant abundances and different species of ants on orange trees during the dry season. This increase in ant abundance was driven primarily by Solenopsis ants, which were both numerous and found to facultatively nest in bromeliads. Bromeliad removal did not affect either ant abundance or composition, potentially because this manipulation coincided with the transition from dry to wet season. Other ant species were never encountered nesting in bromeliads, and the abundances of such ants on tree leaves were unaffected by bromeliad presence or removal. Considering the importance of ants in herbivore regulation, our findings suggest that bromeliads-through their association with ants-could indirectly be associated with biological control in agricultural systems."
https://openalex.org/W4285740150,"The heartwood color of a major plantation tree Cryptomeria japonica shows high variability among clones and cultivars, and brighter heartwood has higher value in the usage of non-laminated wood such as in traditional construction, which makes heartwood color an important trait in breeding of this species. However, the genetic basis of the interactions between genetics and the environment on heartwood color has been understudied while these are necessary for effective breeding programs in multiple environmental condition. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effects of genetics and environments on heartwood color and how they interact in contrasting environments, and to identify genomic regions controlling heartwood color in C . japonica across multiple environments. Heartwood color in terms of L * a * b * color space and spectral reflectance was measured in common gardens established in three contrasting sites. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect heartwood color were identified using previously constructed highly saturated linkage maps. Results found that heartwood color was largely genetically controlled, and genotype-by-environment interaction explained one-third of the total genetic variance of heartwood color. The effect of the environment was small compared to the effect of genetics, whereas environmental effects largely varied among heartwood color traits. QTL analysis identified a large number of QTLs with small to moderate effects (phenotypic variation explained of 6.6% on average). Some of these QTLs were stably expressed in multiple environments or had pleiotropic effects on heartwood color and moisture content. These results indicated that genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity plays an important role in regulating heartwood color and that the identified QTLs would maximize the breeding efficiency of heartwood color in C . japonica in heterogeneous environments."
https://openalex.org/W4285741119,"The objective of this paper is to analyze the association between the job placement results of graduates and the satisfaction that, retrospectively, they express about their university education. Despite the fact that, in Spain, 47.0% of the population aged 25 to 34 has a higher education degree, we have little knowledge of the determinants of university student satisfaction. In addition, most studies have focused on evaluating the university experience (teaching activity, study plans, counselling for students, or facilities) and very few of them have taken into account the influence of graduates’ labour market outcomes on their satisfaction. This issue is of particular interest in the Spanish case, considering the dysfunctional nature of the youth labor market, which has high rates of overqualification, excessive job turnover and high unemployment. The sources of statistical information used in this work include the first two editions of the ""University Graduate Job Placement Survey"", carried out by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE) in 2014 and 2019. The methodology used in the empirical work is the propensity score matching estimator. The results of empirical analysis indicate that graduates’ job placement difficulties have a significant association with their dissatisfaction with their university experience. In particular, educational mismatch (horizontal and vertical) and, to a lesser extent, unemployment and low wages significantly increase the probability of graduates stating that, if they had to start over, they would not return to university or they would not study the same degree."

Related to this, various international policies recommend enabling women to choose where to give birth. We aimed to analyze Swiss women's choice between birth hospitals and birth centers. Employing spatial accessibility analysis, we incorporated four data types: highly disaggregated population data, administrative data, street network data, addresses of birth hospitals and birth centers. 99.8% of Swiss women of childbearing age were included in the analysis (N = 1.896.669). We modelled car travel times from a woman's residence to the nearest birth hospital and birth center. If both birth settings were available within 30 minutes, a woman was considered to have a true choice. Only 58.2% of women had a true choice. This proportion varied considerably across Swiss federal states. The main barrier to a true choice was limited accessibility of birth centers. Median travel time to birth hospitals was 9.8 (M = 12.5), to birth centers 23.9 minutes (M = 28.5). Swiss women are insufficiently empowered to exercise their reproductive autonomy as their choice of place of birth is significantly limited by geographical constraints. It is an ethical and medical imperative to provide women with a true choice. We provide high-resolution insights into the accessibility of birth settings and strong arguments to (re-)examine the need for further birth centers (and birth hospitals) in specific geographical areas. Policy-makers are obligated to improve the accessibility of birth centers to advance women's autonomy and enhance maternal health outcomes after childbirth.

https://openalex.org/W4285743001,"Terrestrial anurans, with their typically short limbs, heavy-set bodies and absent claws or toe pads are incongruous tree climbers, but even occasional arboreal locomotion could offer substantial advantages for evading predators or accessing new shelter or food resources. Despite recent interest, arboreal behaviour remains rarely and unsystematically described for terrestrial amphibians in Europe, likely due to fundamental differences in survey methods and therefore a lack of field data. However, other taxa surveys specifically target trees and tree cavities. We undertook collaborations and large-scale data searches with two major citizen science projects surveying for arboreal mammals in Britain to investigate potential tree climbing by amphibians at a national scale. Remarkably, we found widespread arboreal usage by amphibians in England and Wales, with occupancy of hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellenarius) nest boxes, tree cavities investigated as potential bat roosts and even a bird nest, by common toads (Bufo bufo), but few additional records of frogs or newts. Of the 277-400 sites surveyed annually for dormice since 2009 at least 18 sites had amphibians recorded in nest boxes while of the 1388 trees surveyed for bats a total 1.4% (19 trees) had toads present. Common toads were found using cavities in seven tree species and especially goat willow (Salix caprea). Toads are potentially attracted to tree cavities and arboreal nests because they provide safe and damp microenvironments which can support an abundance of invertebrate prey but the importance of such tree microhabitats for toad conservation remains unknown and our results should be interpreted cautiously. We encourage expanding and linking of unrelated biodiversity monitoring surveys and citizen science initiatives as valuable tools for investigating ecological traits and interactions."

To assess the outcome of GPELF, to re-evaluate and to formulate further strategies there is an imperative need for high quality diagnostic markers. This study was undertaken to identify Lymphatic Filarial biomarkers which can detect LF infections in asymptomatic cases and would also serve as indicators for differentiating among different clinical stages of the disease. A combination of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), MMP zymography, SDS-PAGE, classical 2DE along with MALDI-TOF/MS was done to identify LF biomarkers from serum samples of different stages of LF patients. FT-IR spectroscopy coupled with univariate and multivariate analysis of LF serum samples, revealed significant differences in peak intensity at 3300, 2950, 1645, 1540 and 1448 cm -1 (p&lt;0.05). The proteomics analysis results showed that various proteins were differentially expressed (p&lt;0.05), including C-reactive protein, α-1-antitrypsin, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D like, apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV in different LF clinical stages. Functional pathway analysis suggested the involvement of differentially expressed proteins in vital physiological pathways like acute phase response, hemostasis, complement and coagulation cascades. Furthermore, the differentiation between different stages of LF cases and biomarkers identified in this study clearly demonstrates the potential of the human serum profiling approach for LF detection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of comparative human serum profiling in different categories of LF patients."
https://openalex.org/W4283835835,"There are many theories that account for why households move between residential areas. In this paper, we advance on this by formulating a new mechanism whereby a household's probability of leaving a neighborhood is informed by the number of other households who have previously left that neighborhood. We call this mechanism: the social influence (SI) effect. By applying matching to Swedish register data for Stockholm County (1998-2017), and after adjusting for theoretically relevant confounders from the existing literature, we find that SI has a significant effect on neighborhood out-mobility. Furthermore, we find that the SI effect is moderated by the visibility with which others' behaviors is observed, measured as the number of previous out-movers, the distance to ego, and its salience in the social environment. Our study also discusses some ways in which SI might be entangled with other mechanisms, and outlines future directions from which studies of residential segregation dynamics might be approached."
https://openalex.org/W4285739954,"Background Previous study showed that both melatonin supplement and physical exercise intervention could improve sleep quality in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with the increase in endogenous melatonin level. However, none of the studies have directly compared the effectiveness between the two interventions on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD. Without direct comparison, we do not know which intervention is better. Thus, we designed a study to compare which intervention is more effective to treat sleep disturbance in children with ASD and to examine whether the combination of the two could be the most efficacious. We present a protocol for conducting a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of physical exercise and melatonin supplement on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD. Study design The proposed study will be a four-group randomised control trial (RCT) design, with equal allocation of participants to the three intervention groups and one control group. Methods All eligible participants will be randomly allocated to a morning jogging group, a melatonin supplement group, a combination group and a control group. Changes in sleep quality will be monitored through actigraphic assessment and parental sleep logs. Melatonin levels represented by 6-sulfoxymelatonin will be measured from the participants’ 24-h and the first morning void urinary samples. All the assessments will be carried out before the intervention (T1), in the mid of the study (5 weeks after the commencement of the study) (T2) and after the 10-week intervention (T3).

In Brazil it is more commonly observed in the Southeast, being an emerging public health problem. Hazard mapping models are common in different areas of knowledge, including public health, as a way of inferring reality and seeking to reduce or prevent damage. The aim of this study is to offer a spatial heuristic methodology for assessing the potential risk of transmission of spotted fever in the Rio de Janeiro state, located in the southeastern region of Brazil. For this, we used geospatial tools associated with eco-epidemiological data related to the clinical profile of the disease. The results achieved were substantially encouraging, considering that there are territories with greater or lesser expectation of risk for spotted fever in the study area. We observed that there are important distinctions between the two rickettsiosis scenarios in the same geographic space and that the areas where there is a greater potential risk of contracting rickettsiosis coincide with the administrative regions that concentrated the cases of hospitalization and deaths from the disease, concluding that the scenery found are relevant to the case series for the disease and that the planning of surveillance actions can gain in quality if the use of this spatial analysis tool is incorporated into the routine of local health management."

Dupuytren and M. Peyronie Although results are comparable to surgical intervention, skin laceration is a severe and relevant side effect. Doxycycline (DOX) recently rose interest as an inhibitor of matrix-metalloproteinases alongside its capabilities of skin accumulation. It therefore might be a potential skin protective agent in the use of CCH. Methods For simulation of a fibroproliferative disease adjacent to the skin, we utilized a rodent model of capsular fibrosis involving silicone implants and subsequent fibrotic capsule formation. For in-vitro studies, fibrotic capsules were excised and incubated with 0.9 mg/ml CCH and four different doses of DOX. For in-vivo experiments, animals received 0.0, 0.3 or 0.9 mg/ml CCH injections into the fibrotic capsules with or without prior oral DOX administration. Outcome analysis included histology, immunohistochemistry, gene expression analysis, chemical collagen and DOX concentration measurements as well as μCT imaging. Results In-vitro, DOX showed a dose-dependent inhibition of CCH activity associated with increasing capsule thickness and collagen density and content. In-vivo, oral DOX administration did neither interfere with capsule formation nor in effectiveness of CCH dissolving fibrotic capsule tissue. However, skin thickness and especially collagen density was significantly higher compared to control groups. This led to a reduced rate of clinical skin lacerations after DOX administration. Conclusion DOX inhibits CCH and accumulates in the skin. Thereby, DOX can effectively reduce skin laceration after CCH treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4285741463,"The effects of compression load to a specific body part, e.g. leg, arm, or trunk, evoke many functions and are applied in various fields including clinical medicine, sports, and general health care. Nevertheless, little is known about the functional mechanism of compression load, especially regarding its effects on metabolic function. We investigated the effects of compression load to the trunk on the metabolism. We designed adjustable compression clothes for mice and attached them to ten-week-old C57BL/6N male mice in a controlled environment. The mice were divided into compression and no-compression groups, the latter only wearing the clothes without added compression. The evoked metabolic changes were evaluated using indirect calorimetry and transcriptomics with liver tissue to investigate the mechanism of the metabolic changes induced by the compression load. The results indicated decreases in body weight gain, food intake, and respiratory exchange ratio in the compression group compared to the no-compression group, but these effects were limited in the ""light period"" which was an inactive phase for mice. As a result of the transcriptome analysis after eight hours of compression load to the trunk, several DEGs, e.g., Cpt1A, Hmgcr, were classified into functional categories relating to carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, or immune response. Lipid metabolism impacts included suppression of fatty acid synthesis and activation of lipolysis and cholesterol synthesis in the compression group. Taken together, our results showed that activation of lipid metabolism processes in an inactive phase was induced by the compression load to the trunk."

This study demonstrates the use of statistical spatiotemporal modelling in identifying areas of significantly high injury risk, and areas witnessing significantly increasing risk over time. Methods We performed a retrospective review of hospitalised major trauma patients from the Victorian State Trauma Registry, Australia, between 2007 and 2019. Geographical locations of injury events were mapped to the 79 local government areas (LGAs) in the state. We employed Bayesian spatiotemporal models to quantify spatial and temporal patterns, and analysed the results across a range of geographical remoteness and socioeconomic levels. Results There were 31,317 major trauma patients included. For major trauma overall, we observed substantial spatial variation in injury incidence and a significant 2.1% increase in injury incidence per year. Area-specific risk of injury by motor vehicle collision was higher in regional areas relative to metropolitan areas, while risk of injury by low fall was higher in metropolitan areas. Significant temporal increases were observed in injury by low fall, and the greatest increases were observed in the most disadvantaged LGAs. Conclusions These findings can be used to inform injury prevention initiatives, which could be designed to target areas with relatively high injury risk and with significantly increasing injury risk over time. Our finding that the greatest year-on-year increases in injury incidence were observed in the most disadvantaged areas highlights the need for a greater emphasis on reducing inequities in injury."
https://openalex.org/W4285744158,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia (Calkins H, et al. 2012). There are various methods to treat AF of which Ablation is one of the most effective. We aimed to assess the cost-utility of Cryoballoon ablation (CBA) compared to Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat patients with paroxysmal AF in Iran. A cost-utility analysis was done using a decision-analytic model based on a lifetime Markov structure which was drawn considering the nature of interventions and the natural progress of the disease. Costs data were extracted from medical records of 47 patients of Shahid Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical Center in Tehran in 2019. Parameters and variables such as transition probabilities, risks related to side effects, mortality rates, and utility values were extracted from the available evidence. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also done. TreeAge pro-2020 software was used in all stages of analysis. In the base case analysis, the CBA strategy was associated with higher cost and effectiveness than RFA, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $11,223 per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which compared to Iran's GDP per capita as Willingness to pay threshold, CBA was not cost-effective. On the other hand, considering twice the GDP per capita as a threshold, CBA was cost-effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the findings of base case analysis, showed that RFA was cost-effective and the probability of cost-effectiveness was 59%. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the results of the study have the highest sensitivity to changes in the RFA cost variable. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness results were not robust and are sensitive to changes in variables changes. Primary results showed that CBA compared to RFA is not cost-effective in the treatment of AF considering one GDP per capita. But the sensitivity analysis results showed considerable sensitivity to changes of the ablation costs variable."
https://openalex.org/W4285744236,"Demoralization has become increasingly prevalent among college students who have lost motivation in life and feel hopeless about their future. Many college students who demonstrate symptoms of demoralization are neglected because they might fail to typical symptoms of depression. Taiwanese college students are simultaneously influenced by bicultural-self system, such as individual- and social-oriented views of self, which vary considerably in the view of self, achievement motivation, and the value of self-realization, and may even create contradictory expectations and behavioral standard. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of the relationship between attitude towards demoralization, individual- and social-oriented views of self. Three-hundred fifty-six college students completed the online questionnaire, which was designed to explore their demoralization status and cultural differences. Four groups were divided into bicultural self, individual-oriented self, social-oriented self, and unintegrated self. Bicultural group demonstrated significantly lower demoralization overall scores than other groups. Moreover, the five dimensions of demoralization in college students were mostly significantly and negatively correlated with individual- and social-oriented views of self, indicating that college students’ bicultural views of self may contribute to or prevent demoralization."
