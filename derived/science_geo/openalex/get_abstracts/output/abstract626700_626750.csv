https://openalex.org/W2913992101,"Mast cells can be found in close proximity to peripheral nerve endings where, upon activation, they release a broad range of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However, the precise mechanism underlying this so-called neurogenic inflammation and associated pain has remained elusive. Here we report that the mast-cell-specific receptor Mrgprb2 mediates inflammatory mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and is required for recruitment of innate immune cells at the injury site. We also found that the neuropeptide substance P (SP), an endogenous agonist of Mrgprb2, facilitates immune cells' migration via Mrgprb2. Furthermore, SP activation of the human mast cell led to the release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the human homolog MRGPRX2. Surprisingly, the SP-mediated inflammatory responses were independent of its canonical receptor, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R). These results identify Mrgprb2/X2 as an important neuroimmune modulator and a potential target for treating inflammatory pain."
https://openalex.org/W2914222102,"Genetic, epidemiologic, and biochemical evidence suggests that predisposition to Alzheimer's disease (AD) may arise from altered cholesterol metabolism, although the molecular pathways that may link cholesterol to AD phenotypes are only partially understood. Here, we perform a phenotypic screen for pTau accumulation in AD-patient iPSC-derived neurons and identify cholesteryl esters (CE), the storage product of excess cholesterol, as upstream regulators of Tau early during AD development. Using isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying mutations in the cholesterol-binding domain of APP or APP null alleles, we found that while CE also regulate Aβ secretion, the effects of CE on Tau and Aβ are mediated by independent pathways. Efficacy and toxicity screening in iPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons showed that allosteric activation of CYP46A1 lowers CE specifically in neurons and is well tolerated by astrocytes. These data reveal that CE independently regulate Tau and Aβ and identify a druggable CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis in AD."

In contrast, the impact of aging on regulatory cells in the MuSC niche remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that aging impairs the function of mouse fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and thereby indirectly affects the myogenic potential of MuSCs. Using transcriptomic profiling, we identify WNT1 Inducible Signaling Pathway Protein 1 (WISP1) as a FAP-derived matricellular signal that is lost during aging. WISP1 is required for efficient muscle regeneration and controls the expansion and asymmetric commitment of MuSCs through Akt signaling. Transplantation of young FAPs or systemic treatment with WISP1 restores the myogenic capacity of MuSCs in aged mice and rescues skeletal muscle regeneration. Our work establishes that loss of WISP1 from FAPs contributes to MuSC dysfunction in aged skeletal muscles and demonstrates that this mechanism can be targeted to rejuvenate myogenesis.

The regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle depends on the activity of tissue-resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also termed satellite cells. As a consequence of aging, the regenerative function of MuSCs is dramatically impaired, leading to inefficient muscle repair following injury (Almada and Wagers, 2016Almada A.E. Wagers A.J.

Alterations in both cellular signaling pathways and metabolism have been shown to impair MuSC function during aging.

In addition, impaired mitochondrial function as well as decreased autophagy perturb the physiology of MuSCs during aging and accelerate their transition toward senescence (García-Prat et al., 2016García-Prat L.

Importantly, recent studies have begun to elucidate the nature of the extracellular signals, which are disrupted in the niche and mediate some of these long-lasting intrinsic adaptations. For example, alterations in the levels of Fibronectin, Notch ligands, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, Wnt ligand C1q, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), oxytocin, or apelin have been reported to affect cellular aging pathways and thereby disturb MuSC function (Brack et al., 2007Brack A.S.

Yet, in spite of these fundamental advancements in our understanding of the muscle stem cell niche, the cellular origin of extrinsic MuSC regulatory signals that are affected by the aging process remain largely enigmatic. During adult myogenesis, MuSC function is under the control of a wide range of paracrine signals originating from different cell types in the niche (Mashinchian et al., 2018Mashinchian O. Pisconti A.

The regulatory interplay between MuSCs, immune cells, fibrogenic cells, and adipogenic progenitors has emerged to be of particular complexity (Heredia et al., 2013Heredia J.E. Mukundan L. Chen F.M.

Reciprocal control of MuSCs and fibroblasts is indispensable for efficient expansion of the MuSC pool and for keeping interstitial fibrosis in check (Fry et al., 2016Fry C.S. Kirby T.J. Kosmac K.

Satellite cells, connective tissue fibroblasts and their interactions are crucial for muscle regeneration.Development. 2011; 138: 3625-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Similarly, ablation of lineages with adipogenic potential leads to dysfunctional muscle repair (Liu et al., 2012Liu W. Liu Y. Lai X. Kuang S. Intramuscular adipose is derived from a non-Pax3 lineage and required for efficient regeneration of skeletal muscles.Dev. Biol. 2012; 361: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both fibroblast-like cells and adipocytes residing in skeletal muscle are derived from a common bipotent mesenchymal fibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAP) marked by the expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α (Joe et al., 2010Joe A.W. Yi L. Natarajan A. Le Grand F. So L. Wang J. Rudnicki M.A. Rossi F.M. Muscle injury activates resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors that facilitate myogenesis.Nat.

Mesenchymal progenitors distinct from satellite cells contribute to ectopic fat cell formation in skeletal muscle.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Upon muscle injury, FAPs activate, enter a proliferative phase at the same time as MuSCs, and support myogenic commitment (Joe et al., 2010Joe A.W. Yi L. Natarajan A. Le Grand F. So L. Wang J. Rudnicki M.A. Rossi F.M. Muscle injury activates resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors that facilitate myogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Altered FAP lineage decisions during regeneration perturb extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and impair myogenesis (Fiore et al., 2016Fiore D. Judson R.N. Low M. Lee S. Zhang E. Hopkins C. Xu P.

Med. 2013; 5: 626-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Permissive changes in the micro-environment of diseased muscle and altered FAP apoptosis in the late phase of regeneration promotes excessive differentiation toward fat or fibrotic tissue (Heredia et al., 2013Heredia J.E.

Mesenchymal progenitors distinct from satellite cells contribute to ectopic fat cell formation in skeletal muscle.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). One of the signals involved in fibrotic fate decisions of FAPs is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which can be dynamically regulated by alternative processing of the Pdgfra mRNA in FAPs during muscle regeneration (Mueller et al., 2016Mueller A.A. van Velthoven C.T. Fukumoto K.D. Cheung T.H. Rando T.A. Intronic polyadenylation of PDGFRα in resident stem cells attenuates muscle fibrosis.Nature. 2016; 540: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that FAPs orchestrate a plethora of processes involved in regenerative myogenesis and highlight the need for a better understanding of the signals controlling MuSC function. Notably, aging affects mesenchymal progenitors in multiple tissues (Raggi and Berardi, 2012Raggi C. Berardi A.C. Mesenchymal stem cells, aging and regenerative medicine.Muscles Ligaments Tendons J. 2012; 2: 239-242PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, oxidative stress and other senescence-associated processes impair adipogenic progenitors in aged fat tissue (Tchkonia et al., 2010Tchkonia T. Morbeck D.E. Von Zglinicki T. Van Deursen J. Lustgarten J. Scrable H. Khosla S. Jensen M.D. Kirkland J.L. Fat tissue, aging, and cellular senescence.Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that FAPs and their support function for myogenesis could also be deregulated by the aging process. Here, we set out to test this hypothesis and demonstrate that FAP activity is severely impaired as a consequence of old age. We describe that aged FAPs fail to support MuSCs due to reduced secretion of the matricellular protein WNT1 Inducible Signaling Pathway Protein 1 (WISP1). FAP-secreted WISP1 controls asymmetric MuSC commitment and activates the Akt pathway. Similar to aging, genetic deletion of WISP1 in mice perturbs the MuSC pool and impairs myogenesis. Conversely, systemic treatment of aged mice with recombinant WISP1, or transplantation of young but not aged or WISP1 knockout FAPs, rescues MuSC function, and rejuvenates the regenerative capacity of aged skeletal muscle. In summary, we demonstrate that the regenerative failure inherent to aged muscle can be ameliorated by targeting matricellular communication between FAPs and MuSCs. Given the negative impact of aging on mesenchymal stem cells (Raggi and Berardi, 2012Raggi C. Berardi A.C. Mesenchymal stem cells, aging and regenerative medicine.Muscles Ligaments Tendons J. 2012; 2: 239-242PubMed Google Scholar) and the pivotal role of FAPs as support cells in the MuSC niche (Joe et al., 2010Joe A.W. Yi L. Natarajan A. Le Grand F. So L. Wang J. Rudnicki M.A. Rossi F.M. Muscle injury activates resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors that facilitate myogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, Lemos et al., 2015Lemos D.R. Babaeijandaghi F. Low M. Chang C.K. Lee S.T. Fiore D. Zhang R.H. Natarajan A. Nedospasov S.A.

Mesenchymal progenitors distinct from satellite cells contribute to ectopic fat cell formation in skeletal muscle.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), we first asked whether FAP function is affected during aging. To address this question, we collected FAPs and MuSCs from muscles of 9- to 13-week-old young mice and 20- to 25-month-old pre-geriatric aged mice (Sousa-Victor et al., 2014Sousa-Victor P. Gutarra S. García-Prat L. Rodriguez-Ubreva J. Ortet L. Ruiz-Bonilla V. Jardí M. Ballestar E. González S. Serrano A.L. et al.Geriatric muscle stem cells switch reversible quiescence into senescence.Nature. 2014; 506: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Figure S1A). Ex vivo culture of MuSCs confirmed previously described aging defects that included impaired proliferation, reduced upregulation of the myogenic commitment factor MyoD, and inefficient differentiation of aged MuSCs (Figures S1B–S1E). Notably, we observed that aged FAPs also displayed a range of altered cellular phenotypes. In ex vivo culture, the number of FAPs isolated from aged mice was reduced, and they incorporated less 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyUridine (EdU) compared to young controls (Figures 1A–1C). Immunostaining for PDGFRα revealed lower numbers of FAPs in muscles of aged mice (Figures S1F and S1G). To investigate how aging affects FAP levels during regeneration, we analyzed muscles at different time points after injury. This revealed decreased numbers of aged FAPs at 4 days post-injury (dpi), that failed to be cleared from the tissue at 7 dpi (Figures S1H and S1I). Functional ex vivo analysis of aged FAPs demonstrated impaired growth factor induced (Figures 1D and 1E) and spontaneous (Figure S2A) adipogenesis. Clonal analysis of single aged FAPs showed that the capacity for expansion and the number of adipogenic clones are reduced compared to the young condition (Figure S2B). No difference in differentiation was observed between young and aged FAPs once the cells have taken a fate decision and an adipogenic clone had emerged (Figure S2C), indicating that aging affects fate decisions at the progenitor level. The impaired adipogenic potential of aged FAPs was reflected by reduced levels of oil red O positive intramuscular adipocytes at 14 dpi (Figures 1F, 1G, and S2D). This effect was also observed in H&E stainings (Figure S2E) and confirmed by the quantification of perilipin-positive adipocytes in cross-sections of aged muscles at 14 dpi (Figures S2F and S2G). In contrast, fibrogenic FAP differentiation to α-smooth muscle actin and collagenIα1 positive cells was higher in aged FAPs (Figures 1H, 1I, and S2H). In agreement with these findings, masson trichrome staining of muscle cross-sections of young and aged mice showed elevated fibrosis in aged muscle (Figures 1J and 1K). Gene expression profiling of young and aged FAPs isolated from injured muscles at 7 dpi further confirmed this finding and revealed increased mRNA expression of the gene ontology (GO) term “extracellular matrix” (Figures S2I and S2J). Fibrotic and adipogenic fate decisions in FAPs have been recently demonstrated to be mediated by alternative processing of the PDGFRα transcript (Mueller et al., 2016Mueller A.A. van Velthoven C.T. Fukumoto K.D. Cheung T.H. Rando T.A. Intronic polyadenylation of PDGFRα in resident stem cells attenuates muscle fibrosis.Nature. 2016; 540: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). An intronic variant of PDGFRα coding for a protein isoform with a truncated kinase domain acts as a decoy receptor to inhibit PDGF signaling and inhibit FAP differentiation into fibrotic cells. Interestingly, we observed that the relative amounts of this PDGFRα intronic variant (PDGFRα-In) is reduced after injury in aged muscles as well as in aged FAPs following FACS isolation (Figures 1L and 1M). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the function of aged FAPs is perturbed and that aging uncouples adipogenic from fibrogenic fate decisions at the progenitor level. Following injury, FAPs initially expand to support MuSC function (Fiore et al., 2016Fiore D. Judson R.N. Low M. Lee S. Zhang E. Hopkins C. Xu P. Lenzi A. Rossi F.M. Lemos D.R.

In order to characterize the cellular cross-talk between FAPs and MuSCs in a system where the age of each cell type can be uncoupled, we isolated MuSCs from tdTomato (Td) mice (Prigge et al., 2013Prigge J.R.

The cells were then tracked based on the reporter in co-cultures with wild-type (WT) FAPs (Figures 2A and S3B). Aged FAPs displayed a reduced ability to support MuSC expansion and differentiation (Figures 2B–2D). The positive effect of FAPs on MuSC expansion correlated with the amount of FAPs (Figure S3C) and was not due to effects on the viability of MuSCs (Figure S3D). We next tested whether FAPs support MuSCs through soluble factors. Using single myofiber cultures, we demonstrated that the proliferation of MuSCs was increased in the presence of medium conditioned by young FAPs but was unaffected by medium conditioned by aged FAPs (Figures 2E and 2F). FAP conditioned culture medium was also able to promote the proliferation and differentiation of MuSCs ex vivo (Figures S3E and S3F). Thus, aging impairs the secretion of a soluble myogenic support signal from FAPs. To uncover the molecular nature of the FAP-derived MuSC support signal lost during aging, we profiled the transcriptome of FAPs and MuSCs that were isolated in injured and uninjured muscles from young and aged mice. We first analyzed the GO terms enriched in FAPs compared to MuSCs and identified strong signatures of “organ development,” “cell adhesion,” and “extracellular matrix organization” in FAPs (Table S1). The fibrogenic nature of FAPs was highlighted by the higher expression of genes of the “extracellular matrix” GO term (Figure S4), and aging enhanced both molecular regulators of fibrosis in quiescent FAPs (Table S2) and ECM or fibrosis signatures at 7 dpi (Figures S2I and S2J). We next examined which transcripts coding for secreted proteins were upregulated in activated FAPs. Out of the 321 genes significantly upregulated with a fold change >2 during activation of young FAPs, we identified 20 secreted signaling proteins (Figure 3A). Genes upregulated in activated FAPs were then filtered for differential regulation with age and activation. The resulting 10 transcripts differentially regulated in aged activated FAPs contained a single secreted protein belonging to the Cyr61/CTGF/NOV (CCN) family of matricellular proteins and termed Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1/CCN4) (Figure 3B). WISP1 was also the most downregulated gene when aged activated FAPs were directly compared to young activated FAPs (Table S3). qPCR analysis confirmed that WISP1 is upregulated in young FAPs following muscle injury, and that this induction is blunted more than 2-fold in FAPs from aged mice (Figure 3C). In agreement with these observations, the upregulation of WISP1 mRNA and protein was blunted in regenerating tibialis anterior muscles of aged mice (Figures 3D and 3E). To confirm that FAPs are the principal cell type in which aging affects WISP1 secretion, we interrogated different cell types found in quiescent and regenerating muscles. These included lineage positive cells (Lin+), comprising immune, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells, MuSCs, FAPs, and Sca1+/CD34+/PDGFRα– cells (hereafter called PDGFRα–). FAPs, MuSCs, and PDGFRα– cells upregulated WISP1 expression following injury, while very low expression was observed in Lin+ cells (Figure S5A). Notably, FAPs were the only cell type that displayed an age-dependent reduction in WISP1 expression. Since WISP1 is a secreted protein, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to elucidate where WISP1 is produced in skeletal muscle. Consistent with the localization of FAPs, we observed an upregulation of WISP1 mRNA granules typical of RNA FISH experiments in the interstitial space of regenerating muscles (Figures S5B and S5C). No staining was detected in muscles of WISP1 knockout (WISP1−/−) mice. We also observed that WISP1 mRNA was not directly associated with MuSCs but frequently localized to the vicinity of these cells (Figure S5D). These results identify WISP1 as a FAP-derived MuSC support signal that is impaired during aging. We next asked whether the loss of WISP1 is sufficient to impair muscle regeneration independently of other age-induced perturbations by analyzing WISP1−/− mice (Maeda et al., 2015Maeda A. Ono M. Holmbeck K. Li L. Kilts T.M. Kram V. Noonan M.L. Yoshioka Y. McNerny E.M. Tantillo M.A. et al.WNT1-induced Secreted Protein-1 (WISP1), a novel regulator of bone turnover and Wnt signaling.J. Biol.

Some patients with heart disease develop collateral coronary arteries, and this correlates with increased survival. However, it is not known how these collaterals develop or how to stimulate them. We demonstrate that neonatal mouse hearts use a novel mechanism to build collateral arteries in response to injury. Arterial endothelial cells (ECs) migrated away from arteries along existing capillaries and reassembled into collateral arteries, which we termed ""artery reassembly"". Artery ECs expressed CXCR4, and following injury, capillary ECs induced its ligand, CXCL12. CXCL12 or CXCR4 deletion impaired collateral artery formation and neonatal heart regeneration. Artery reassembly was nearly absent in adults but was induced by exogenous CXCL12. Thus, understanding neonatal regenerative mechanisms can identify pathways that restore these processes in adults and identify potentially translatable therapeutic strategies for ischemic heart disease."

https://openalex.org/W2912023539,"Aberrant activation of AKT disturbs the proliferation, survival and metabolic homeostasis of various human cancers. Thus, it is critical to understand the upstream signalling pathways governing AKT activation. Here, we report that AKT undergoes SETDB1-mediated lysine methylation to promote its activation, which is antagonized by the Jumonji-family demethylase KDM4B. Notably, compared with wild-type mice, mice harbouring non-methylated mutant Akt1 not only exhibited reduced body size but were also less prone to carcinogen-induced skin tumours, in part due to reduced AKT activation. Mechanistically, the interaction of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate with AKT facilitates its interaction with SETDB1 for subsequent AKT methylation, which in turn sustains AKT phosphorylation. Pathologically, genetic alterations, including SETDB1 amplification, aberrantly promote AKT methylation to facilitate its activation and oncogenic functions. Thus, AKT methylation is an important step, synergizing with PI3K signalling to control AKT activation. This suggests that targeting SETDB1 signalling could be a potential therapeutic strategy for combatting hyperactive AKT-driven cancers. Guo et al. identify SETDB1 and KDM4B as the methyltransferase and demethylase, respectively, for AKT. AKT methylation promotes its kinase activity and the subsequent tumorigenesis."

Here, we define epigenomic landscape during epidermal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and create inference networks that integrate gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and TF binding to define regulatory mechanisms during keratinocyte specification. We found two critical chromatin networks during surface ectoderm initiation and keratinocyte maturation, which are driven by TFAP2C and p63, respectively. Consistently, TFAP2C, but not p63, is sufficient to initiate surface ectoderm differentiation, and TFAP2C-initiated progenitor cells are capable of maturing into functional keratinocytes. Mechanistically, TFAP2C primes the surface ectoderm chromatin landscape and induces p63 expression and binding sites, thus allowing maturation factor p63 to positively autoregulate its own expression and close a subset of the TFAP2C-initiated surface ectoderm program. Our work provides a general framework to infer TF networks controlling chromatin transitions that will facilitate future regenerative medicine advances."

Axon loss determines persistent disability in multiple sclerosis patients. Here, we use in vivo calcium imaging in a multiple sclerosis model to show that cytoplasmic calcium levels determine the choice between axon loss and survival. We rule out the endoplasmic reticulum, glutamate excitotoxicity, and the reversal of the sodium-calcium exchanger as sources of intra-axonal calcium accumulation and instead identify nanoscale ruptures of the axonal plasma membrane as the critical path of calcium entry. Axon loss is a key determinant of persistent functional deficits in the common neuroinflammatory condition multiple sclerosis (Friese et al., 2014Friese M.A. Schattling B. Fugger L. Mechanisms of neurodegeneration and axonal dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2014; 10: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that axons in multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), undergo focal axonal degeneration (Nikić et al., 2011Nikić I. Merkler D. Sorbara C. Brinkoetter M. Kreutzfeldt M. Bareyre F.M. Brück W. Bishop D. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. A reversible form of axon damage in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Focal axonal degeneration is a multi-step process that is initially characterized by axonal swellings and subcellular changes, such as mitochondrial damage, cytoskeletal disturbances, and impaired axonal transport (Nikić et al., 2011Nikić I. Merkler D. Sorbara C. Brinkoetter M. Kreutzfeldt M. Bareyre F.M. Brück W. Bishop D. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M.

These structural and functional changes, however, only progress to fragmentation in some axons, while they are fully reversible in others. Which molecular checkpoints decide whether focal axonal degeneration proceeds to irreversible axon degeneration or reverses toward recovery remain elusive. Several lines of evidence suggest that the intra-axonal calcium concentration could be such a checkpoint. First, increased cytoplasmic calcium levels have been associated with axon degeneration processes following transection or contusion injuries (Williams et al., 2014Williams P.R. Marincu B.-N. Sorbara C.D. Mahler C.F. Schumacher A.-M. Griesbeck O. Kerschensteiner M. Misgeld T. A recoverable state of axon injury persists for hours after spinal cord contusion in vivo.Nat.

Live imaging of calcium dynamics during axon degeneration reveals two functionally distinct phases of calcium influx.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 15026-15038Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, increased axonal calcium levels have been reported in neuroinflammatory lesions (Siffrin et al., 2010Siffrin V. Radbruch H. Glumm R. Niesner R. Paterka M. Herz J. Leuenberger T. Lehmann S.M. Luenstedt S.

Radbruch M. et al.Tracking CNS and systemic sources of oxidative stress during the course of chronic neuroinflammation.Acta Neuropathol. 2015; 130: 799-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that increased cytoplasmic calcium can trigger intra-axonal destruction pathways, such as the activation of calpain proteases (Yang et al., 2013Yang J. Weimer R.M. Kallop D. Olsen O. Wu Z. Renier N. Uryu K. Tessier-Lavigne M. Regulation of axon degeneration after injury and in development by the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1175-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here, we now systematically explore the contribution and source of intra-axonal calcium in focal axonal degeneration using a spinal in vivo multiphoton imaging approach in combination with pre-existing and newly generated ratiometric calcium reporter mouse lines. By recording cytoplasmic calcium levels in individual axons that pass through neuroinflammatory lesions, we show that calcium accumulates in the axoplasm early during the focal axonal degeneration process. Following these axons over several hours then revealed that such calcium accumulations predict subsequent axonal fate: axons that clear calcium can recover, while those that maintain elevated calcium levels will likely degenerate. Monitoring and manipulating the calcium levels in distinct subcellular compartments then allowed us to identify the extracellular space—and not intracellular calcium stores—as the major source of the cytoplasmic calcium accumulation. Influx from the extracellular space occurs via nanoscale disruptions of the plasma membrane and therefore independent of classic calcium channels or pumps. Here, we thus propose calcium permeable membrane nanoruptures as a novel mechanism of inflammatory axon injury. To explore whether axoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]cyt) are altered in neuroinflammatory lesions, we induced EAE in Thy1-CerTN-L15 transgenic mice, in which neurons contain the genetically encoded calcium sensor CerTN in their cytoplasm (Heim et al., 2007Heim N. Garaschuk O. Friedrich M.W. Mank M. Milos R.I. Kovalchuk Y. Konnerth A. Griesbeck O. Improved calcium imaging in transgenic mice expressing a troponin C-based biosensor.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensor enables the ratiometric determination of calcium levels and in combination with spinal in vivo multiphoton imaging thus allowed us to record [Ca2+]cyt in individual dorsal column axons (Figure S1; see STAR Methods for details). While cytoplasmic calcium levels in healthy axons were tightly regulated, a substantial fraction of axons in acute EAE lesions showed elevated calcium levels. Notably, increased calcium levels were not only seen in fragmented (stage 2) and swollen (stage 1) axons, but also in about 10% of morphologically unaltered (stage 0) axons (Figures 1A–1C). This indicates that a dysregulation of [Ca2+]cyt occurs early during focal axonal degeneration. To assess how such dysregulated calcium levels influence axonal fate, we followed axon morphology and [Ca2+]cyt in a cohort of more than 300 axons in acute EAE lesions over time (n = 307 axons, 8 mice, imaged for a total of 1,201 “axon hours”). These experiments revealed that within an hour of observation about 4% of normal-appearing axons in neuroinflammatory lesions showed an intra-axonal calcium rise, and a substantial proportion of these axons (16% per hour) later progress to axonal swelling. In contrast, we rarely observed swelling of axons without a preceding calcium rise (Figures 1D and 1E). These results thus indicate that a rise of [Ca2+]cyt is the initiating step of focal axonal degeneration. Furthermore, cytoplasmic calcium levels also predict the subsequent progression along the focal axonal degeneration pathway: swollen [Ca2+]cyt-high axons had a higher probability of fragmentation and a lower probability of recovery compared to swollen axons that re-established cytoplasmic calcium homeostasis (Figures 1D and 1E). These results support the notion that elevations of cytoplasmic calcium trigger and drive axonal degeneration in neuroinflammatory lesions. Next, we explored which calcium sources are responsible for axoplasmic calcium accumulation. First, we investigated whether calcium release from the axonal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) initiates axonal degeneration, as has been shown in several axon injury models (Ouardouz et al., 2009Ouardouz M.

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To directly monitor axonal ER calcium [Ca2+]ER in vivo, we generated Thy1-TwitchER transgenic mice, which express ER-targeted Twitch-2B 54S+ (Thestrup et al., 2014Thestrup T. Litzlbauer J. Bartholomäus I. Mues M. Russo L. Dana H. Kovalchuk Y. Liang Y. Kalamakis G. Laukat Y. et al.Optimized ratiometric calcium sensors for functional in vivo imaging of neurons and T lymphocytes.Nat.

Axonal endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content controls release probability in CNS nerve terminals.Neuron. 2017; 93: 867-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) in neurons (Figures S2A and S2B). In vivo multiphoton imaging of Thy1-TwitchER mice allowed us to track changes of [Ca2+]ER induced by blocking ER calcium uptake (Figures S2C and S2D) or by contusion of spinal axons (Figures S2E, S2F, and S2G). We then measured [Ca2+]ER in individual axons in the healthy spinal cord and in acute spinal EAE lesions. In contrast to the changes in cytoplasmic calcium that precede morphological axon alterations, depletion of ER calcium was detected only in a small fraction of fragmented axons (Figures 2A–2C). Furthermore, when we induced ryanodine-receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER by caffeine application to the spinal cord of healthy mice, we could efficiently deplete axonal ER calcium stores in vivo (Figures 2D and 2E; Video S1); however, such ER depletion did not result in sustained changes of [Ca2+]cyt in healthy axons (Figures 2F and 2G) or in axons that pass through neuroinflammatory lesions (Figures 2H and 2I). Taken together, these data indicate that calcium release from the axoplasmic reticulum occurs only late during focal axonal degeneration, and that—even when it occurs—ER depletion alone is insufficient to induce sustained changes of cytoplasmic calcium like those seen in focal axonal degeneration. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIyYjQzZmMzNzM5NjgwMDBhZjFhMjI4NzQyZWE3ODFiOCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzE0OTkyfQ.StfF9bvkG1UzqTKkOfhl3Q--LDeQDq4dgTdEu7_opqy8WD6VTOTT0V45M47njSqejMRAvDOfxqpRU6KPJcilpFTmCP5AP1TmDPT-7Bp8Odv3mLURIHE3cFQK97GH2W_-eyc1kGQks4B1LwYq2flsYst0kYHOrUC45de4h90QqT96r77OEOILBUDppb6PASXY3IsfCObBvdEgN6JcjdXoTwlRJ9jj8f3M6ImsDJFUKNav1lcY-jEmYcJImM4dA5nKZ6XxuUuvqNxbe-Ii4sKo3_3CbsbAodIyf-eg8srFKX0vwkW9dOGTmPNxfiL-vahRVr1usF_I527txIBGB0dvUA Download .mp4 (2.39 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. ER Depletion Is Insufficient to Cause Sustained [Ca2+]cyt Increase In Vivo, Related to Figure 2In vivo multiphoton time-lapse of the healthy spinal cord axons of a Thy1-TwitchER and a Thy1-CerTN-L15 transgenic mouse upon application of 50 mM caffeine. Top: ratiometric (YFP/CFP) images color coded for ER calcium levels ([Ca2+]ER). Bottom: ratiometric (YFP/CFP) images color coded for cytoplasmic calcium levels ([Ca2+]cyt). Scale bar, 25 μm. As ER calcium stores seemed insufficient to explain the cytoplasmic calcium rise in neuroinflammatory lesions, we next asked whether extracellular calcium accumulates in EAE axons. For this purpose, we locally removed extracellular calcium by incubating the exposed healthy or inflamed spinal cord with the Ca2+-chelator EGTA. While we observed no changes of [Ca2+]cyt in healthy axons (Figure S3), time-lapse in vivo imaging of acute EAE lesions revealed that extracellular calcium chelation normalized [Ca2+]cyt in both normal-appearing and swollen axons within 4 h (Figures 3A and 3B ). Notably, normalization of [Ca2+]cyt was sufficient to induce morphological recovery of swollen axons and completely blocked axonal fragmentation in EAE lesions (Figure 3C). Influx of calcium from the extracellular space is thus the main driver of axon degeneration in neuroinflammatory lesions. Previous work has implicated glutamate excitotoxicity, opening of plasma membrane calcium channels, and reversal of the sodium-calcium exchanger as mediators of extracellular calcium influx in various forms of axon degeneration (Friese et al., 2014Friese M.A. Schattling B. Fugger L. Mechanisms of neurodegeneration and axonal dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2014; 10: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Macrez et al., 2016Macrez R.

However, these canonical pathways of detrimental calcium overload did not seem to operate in focal axonal degeneration: neither the inhibition of the sodium-calcium exchanger (Figures S4A and S4C) or of voltage-gated calcium channels (Figures S4B and S4D) reduced cytoplasmic calcium levels or improved axonal fate in acute neuroinflammatory lesions, nor did the application of exogenous glutamic acid or glutamate agonists measurably alter cytoplasmic calcium levels or axonal fate (Figures S4E–S4G). An alternative entry path for calcium into axons are disruptions of the plasma membrane, which have been previously described to occur in response to traumatic CNS injuries (Povlishock et al., 1983Povlishock J.T.

Commun. 2014; 5: 5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To investigate whether such axonal membrane disruptions are also induced in neuroinflammatory lesions (in the absence of an obvious mechanical trigger), we subdurally applied fluorescently labeled macromolecules of different sizes (0.8 kDa cadaverine or 3, 10, and 70 kDa dextran) to the spinal cord of control and EAE animals. Fixed tissue analysis showed that all dyes remained excluded from the axoplasm in healthy animals, whereas a substantial proportion of axons in EAE lesions took up dye (Figures 4A and 4B ). The fraction of labeled axons decreased with increasing size of the injected dye, and no significant axonal dye uptake was observed with the largest dye (70 kDa dextran), indicating that these membrane disruptions are <10 nm in size (Choi et al., 2010Choi J.J. Wang S. Tung Y.-S. Morrison 3rd, B. Konofagou E.E. Molecules of various pharmacologically-relevant sizes can cross the ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening in vivo.Ultrasound Med. Biol. 2010; 36: 58-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Notably, ∼20% of normal-appearing axons, as well as many swollen and fragmented axons in EAE lesions showed cadaverine uptake, suggesting that such membrane nanoruptures occur already at the early stages of axon damage. Further analysis revealed that the presence of such nanoruptures was spatially correlated with local inflammation as the proportion of dye-positive axons as well as the extent of axon degeneration was higher in the densely infiltrated lesion center than in the lesion border (Figures S5A–S5C). In the lesion area, dye uptake was independent of axon caliber (Figure S5D) but appeared to be more pronounced in demyelinated axons compared to those axons that retain their myelin sheaths (Figure S5E). Investigating axonal dye uptake throughout the course of EAE further revealed that axonal membrane nanoruptures start with initial lesion formation at the onset of EAE symptoms and last to the chronic stage (at 15 days after EAE onset; Figures S5F and S5G). Axonal membrane damage thus occurs in lesions at different stages of the disease course and in axons at different stages of the degeneration process and can thus provide a persisting path for calcium entry during inflammatory axon damage. To directly test this hypothesis, we subdurally applied fluorescently labeled cadaverine in Thy1-CerTN-L15 mice and performed simultaneous in vivo imaging of dye uptake and [Ca2+]cyt. In line with our fixed-tissue analysis, we observed virtually no axonal uptake of cadaverine in healthy animals in vivo, whereas in EAE animals imaged at the peak of disease a substantial fraction of axons took up cadaverine (Figures 4C and 4D). At the same time, dye uptake and cytoplasmic calcium elevations correlated strongly on a single-axon level in vivo. For example, more than half of the normal-appearing axons that were dye positive also showed elevated calcium levels, while in the same lesions such calcium elevations are observed in only about 5% of normal-appearing axons that do not show dye uptake (Figure 4D). Membrane disruptions appear to be a major path of axonal calcium influx as about 60% of normal-appearing and swollen axons with elevated cytoplasmic calcium take up dye (Figure 4D). Our study identifies the cytoplasmic accumulation of calcium as a key driver of axon degeneration in neuroinflammatory lesions. This is in line with a number of previous studies of damaged axons after CNS trauma that have identified calcium overload as an important predictor of both the initial axonal interruption after mechanical impact (Williams et al., 2014Williams P.R.

Ankarcrona M. Beyond the critical point: an overview of excitotoxicity, calcium overload and the downstream consequences.Neurosci. Lett. 2018; 663: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our in vivo time-lapse observations (cf. Figures 1D and 1E), however, also emphasize that such cytoplasmic calcium accumulation is not necessarily a “point of no return,” as even a proportion of morphologically altered (swollen) axons manage to clear elevated calcium levels. This often results in subsequent morphological recovery, suggesting that also under the sustained stress of a neuroinflammatory lesion a “window of opportunity” exists to rescue axons in a metastable prodromal state of degeneration, just as we described previously for acute trauma (Williams et al., 2014Williams P.R. Marincu B.-N. Sorbara C.D. Mahler C.F. Schumacher A.-M. Griesbeck O. Kerschensteiner M. Misgeld T. A recoverable state of axon injury persists for hours after spinal cord contusion in vivo.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, the fate of axons in neuroinflammatory lesions is likely decided by the net balance of calcium sources and calcium sinks with both sides of this balance being potentially amendable to therapy. Our results further indicate that the extracellular space, in which the free calcium concentration is about 10,000-fold higher than in the axonal cytoplasm, is a major source of the cytoplasmic calcium accumulation. This is supported by our findings that removal of extracellular calcium by superfusion of the spinal cord with the calcium chelator EGTA normalized intraaxonal calcium levels and effectively halts axonal degeneration. This experiment per se does not exclude a role of internal calcium stores, as, for example, “store-operated calcium entry” (SOCE) opens a path for calcium from the extracellular space in response to calcium efflux from the ER (Li et al., 2013Li S.

However, our direct measurements of ER calcium levels in mature axons show that such a depletion of the axonal ER calcium stores is not occurring early during focal axonal degeneration but can only be observed during late stages. This sets axon degeneration in inflammatory lesions aside from secondary axon injury after spinal laser lesions, where prior reports documented early involvement of ER stores (Stirling et al., 2014Stirling D.P. Cummins K. Wayne Chen S.R. Stys P. Axoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release causes secondary degeneration of spinal axons.Ann. Neurol. 2014; 75: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our experiments, the pharmacological induction of ER calcium depletion in mature spinal cord axons did not result in marked changes of the intra-axonal calcium levels or any overt signs of axon degeneration—irrespective of whether this depletion was done in a normal or a neuroinflammatory environment. These findings indicate that by itself depletion of axonal ER stores does not cause measurable increases in axoplasmic calcium in myelinated axons in vivo, which is in accordance with recent in vitro measurements (de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017de Juan-Sanz J. Holt G.T. Schreiter E.R. de Juan F. Kim D.S. Ryan T.A. Axonal endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content controls release probability in CNS nerve terminals.Neuron. 2017; 93: 867-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Hence, our data suggest that depletion of ER stores alone is unlikely to initiate axonal degeneration. How can these results be squared with the well-established fact that the ER contains micromolar concentrations of calcium (∼150 μM; de Juan-Sanz et al., 2017de Juan-Sanz J. Holt G.T.

Axonal endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content controls release probability in CNS nerve terminals.Neuron. 2017; 93: 867-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the prior reports of a role of ER-derived calcium in ischemic and traumatic axon degeneration in the spinal cord (Stirling et al., 2014Stirling D.P.

First, the amount of calcium contained in the axonal ER might be lower than often assumed—while the concentration appears to exceed axoplasmic levels by two orders of magnitude, the volume fraction of axonal ER is small compared to the somato-dendritic compartment, often forming a spare network of thin (<50 nm) tubules (Terasaki, 2018Terasaki M. Axonal endoplasmic reticulum is very narrow.J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131: jcs210450Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2017Wu Y. Whiteus C. Xu C.S. Hayworth K.J. Weinberg R.J. Hess H.F. De Camilli P. Contacts between the endoplasmic reticulum and other membranes in neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E4859-E4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). While our imaging approaches lack resolution to confirm this morphology in vivo, confocal imaging in our Thy1-TwitchER mice showed that neuronal cell bodies and proximal dendrites are labeled much brighter than the corresponding axons, suggesting a lower volume fraction (Figures S2A and S2B). Still, the fact that, under non-inflammatory stress conditions, ER-derived calcium plays important roles suggests that other processes—for example, impaired clearance across the plasma membrane or into other organelles, such as mitochondria—contribute in other disease settings, but not in the neuroinflammatory lesions studied here. Together these findings highlight how directly measuring calcium levels in different axonal compartments can illuminate our understanding of the role of calcium homeostasis in diseased axons. Indeed, when we used our approach to probe the mechanisms of calcium influx across the axonal plasma membrane, we found that canonical pathways of neuronal calcium influx such as opening of glutamate receptor and voltage-gated calcium channels or reverse action of the sodium-calcium exchanger are unlikely to drive calcium accumulation during focal axonal degeneration. In the case of glutamate, we found that, while exposure of the dorsal spinal cord to glutamic acid is sufficient to induce cytoplasmic calcium accumulation in neuronal cell bodies that can be found dispersed in the white matter, no such changes of the cytoplasmic calcium are induced in axons that run next to these neurons. One possible explanation might be the different densities of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are relatively abundant at synaptic and extra-synaptic locations on the cell body and dendrites but found only in confined nanocomplexes along mature axons in rodents and humans (Ouardouz et al., 2009Ouardouz M.

https://openalex.org/W2914349469,"FAM3C/Interleukin-like EMT Inducer (ILEI) is an oncogenic member of the FAM3 cytokine family and serves essential roles in both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer metastasis. ILEI expression levels are regulated through a non-canonical TGFβ signaling pathway by 3′-UTR-mediated translational silencing at the mRNA level by hnRNP E1. TGFβ stimulation or silencing of hnRNP E1 increases ILEI translation and induces an EMT program that correlates with enhanced invasion and migration. Recently, EMT has been linked to the formation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that confer both tumor cell heterogeneity as well as chemoresistant properties. Herein, we demonstrate that hnRNP E1 knockdown significantly shifts normal mammary epithelial cells to mesenchymal BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. We further validate that modulating ILEI protein levels results in the abrogation of these phenotypes, promoting further investigation into the unknown mechanism of ILEI signaling that drives tumor progression. We identify LIFR as the receptor for ILEI, which mediates signaling through STAT3 to drive both EMT and BCSC formation. Reduction of either ILEI or LIFR protein levels results in reduced tumor growth, fewer tumor initiating cells and reduced metastasis within the hnRNP E1 knock-down cell populations in vivo. These results reveal a novel ligand-receptor complex that drives the formation of BCSCs and represents a unique target for the development of metastatic breast cancer therapies."

Furthermore, the ability of EC to modulate the expression of some key genes in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway (IIS), involved in longevity and oxidative or heat shock stress response, has also been explored. The final aim was to contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the biological effects of flavonoids. The results showed that EC-treated wild-type C. elegans exhibited increased survival and reduced oxidative damage of biomolecules when submitted to thermal stress. EC treatment led to a moderate elevation in ROS levels, which might activate endogenous mechanisms of defense protecting against oxidative insult. The enhanced stress resistance induced by EC was found to be mediated through the IIS pathway, since assays in daf-2, age-1, akt-1, akt-2, sgk-1, daf-16, skn-1 and hsf-1 loss of function mutant strains failed to show any heat-resistant phenotype against thermal stress when treated with EC. Consistently, EC treatment upregulated the expression of some stress resistance associated genes, such as gst-4, hsp-16.2 and hsp-70, which are downstream regulated by the IIS pathway."

Here, we found that higher expression of VIP/VPAC1 was observed in gastric cancer compared to the adjacent normal tissues. The increased expression of VIP/VPAC1 in gastric cancer correlated positively with invasion, tumor stage, lymph node, distant metastases, and poor survival. Moreover, high expression of VIP and VPAC1, advanced tumor stage and distant metastasis were independent prognostic factors. VPAC1 activation by VIP markedly induced TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ entry, and eventually promoted gastric cancer progression in a Ca2+ signaling-dependent manner. Inhibition of VPAC1 and its signaling pathway could block the progressive responses. VPAC1/TRPV4/Ca2+ signaling in turn enhanced the expression and secretion of VIP in gastric cancer cells, enforcing a positive feedback regulation mechanism. Taken together, our study demonstrate that VPAC1 is significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer and VPAC1/TRPV4/Ca2+ signaling axis could enforce a positive feedback regulation in gastric cancer progression. VIP/VPAC1 may serve as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer."

This study aimed to analyze spatial and temporal variations of ecosystem services from 2000 to 2015 to assess the effects of the GTGP, including carbon sequestration, water regulation, soil conservation and sand fixation. During the study period, the area of forest land and grassland significantly expanded, while the area of farmland decreased sharply. Ecosystem services showed an overall improvement with localized deterioration. Carbon sequestration, water regulation and soil conservation increased substantially. Sand fixation showed a decreasing trend mainly because of decreased wind speeds. There were synergies between carbon sequestration and water regulation, and tradeoffs between soil conservation and sand fixation. It was concluded that ecological projects have contributed significantly to the rehabilitation of the fragile ecosystems of this region. To make these projects more successful and sustainable, long-term management procedures are necessary to maintain and consolidate the improvements."
https://openalex.org/W2912880260,"Aside from its well-known nuclear routes of signaling, estrogen also mediates its effects through cytoplasmic signaling. Estrogen signaling involves numerous posttranslational modifications of its receptor ERα, the best known being phosphorylation. Our research group previously showed that upon estrogen stimulation, ERα is methylated on residue R260 and forms the mERα/Src/PI3K complex, central to the rapid transduction of nongenomic estrogen signals. Regulation of ERα signaling via its phosphorylation by growth factors is well recognized, and we wondered whether they could also trigger ERα methylation (mERα). Here, we found that IGF-1 treatment of MCF-7 cells induced rapid ERα methylation by the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 and triggered the binding of mERα to IGF-1R. Mechanistically, we showed that PRMT1 bound constitutively to IGF-1R and that PRMT1 became activated upon IGF-1 stimulation. Moreover, we found that expression or pharmacological inhibition of PRMT1 impaired mERα and IGF-1 signaling. Our findings were substantiated in a cohort of breast tumors in which IGF-1R expression was positively correlated with ERα/Src and ERα/PI3K expression, hallmarks of nongenomic estrogen signaling, reinforcing the link between IGF-1R and mERα. Altogether, these results provide a new insight into ERα and IGF-1R interference, and open novel perspectives for combining endocrine therapies with PRMT1 inhibitors in ERα-positive tumors."

BIN1 is a member of the amphiphysin family of proteins and has reported roles in the generation of membrane curvature and endocytosis. Endocytic dysfunction is a pathological feature of AD, and endocytosis of the amyloid precursor protein is an important step in its subsequent cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1).

Here, using biochemical and immunohistochemistry analyses we report that a 50% global reduction of BIN1 protein levels resulting from a single Bin1 allele deletion in mice does not change BACE1 levels or localization in vivo, nor does this reduction alter the production of endogenous murine Aβ in nontransgenic mice. Furthermore, we found that reduction of BIN1 levels in the 5XFAD mouse model of amyloidosis does not alter Aβ deposition nor behavioral deficits associated with cerebral amyloid burden. Finally, a conditional BIN1 knockout in excitatory neurons did not alter BACE1, APP, C-terminal fragments derived from BACE1 cleavage of APP, or endogenous Aβ levels.

Here, we report that a 50% reduction in BIN1 expression does not alter BACE1 or APP localization or endogenous Aβ production in WT mice. Similarly, 50% reduction of BIN1 did not modify amyloid pathology and behavioral deficits in a mouse model of AD. Furthermore, neuron-specific conditional knockout (cKO) of Bin1 did not alter BACE1 or APP localization to membrane fractions generated in the mouse brain or affect Aβ production. The role of BIN1 in the brain remains largely unknown, but several lines of evidence indicate its expression in a range of brain cell subtypes (11De Rossi P. Buggia-Prévot V. Clayton B.L.

To explore the possible contribution of Bin1 expression in Aβ production, we sought to generate a model of global Bin1 knockdown. Because homozygous KO of Bin1 in mice results in perinatal lethality due to severe cardiomyopathy (30Muller A.J. Baker J.F. DuHadaway J.B. Ge K. Farmer G. Donover P.S. Meade R. Reid C. Grzanna R.

Synapsin expression in the testes causes recombination of the floxed gene in the sperm (31Rempe D. Vangeison G. Hamilton J. Li Y. Jepson M. Federoff H.J.

The resulting progeny had a global single-allele deletion of Bin1 (Bin1+/−), and pups were viable and had no obvious phenotypic abnormalities. Loss of a single Bin1 allele caused a 50% reduction in forebrain BIN1 levels in Bin1+/− mice compared with WT littermate controls, but no significant differences were observed in the steady-state levels of APP, BACE1, or the BIN1 paralog amphiphysin 1 (Amph1) (Fig. 1A). Quantification showed a 45% reduction in high molecular weight BIN1 isoforms (BIN1:H) and 55% reduction in low molecular weight BIN1 isoforms (BIN1:L) (Fig. 1B). Prominent BACE1 localization in hippocampal mossy fibers has been widely reported, with its absence in BACE1 KO mice resulting in disorganized infrapyramidal mossy fiber bundles (32Hitt B. Riordan S.M. Kukreja L. Eimer W.A. Rajapaksha T.W.

The 50% reduction of BIN1 in Bin1+/− mice did not cause any overt mislocalization of BACE1 or APP with similar BACE1 localization of BACE1 to hippocampal mossy fibers and APP to the CA3 neuronal cell layer in WT and Bin1+/− mice (Fig. 1C). To assess whether the diminution in BIN1 expression affected amyloidogenic processing of APP, we quantified endogenous Aβ levels. Analysis of homogenates from 4-month-old WT and Bin1+/− mice showed no significant differences in the steady-state levels of Aβ40 or Aβ42 (Fig. 1D). To determine whether a 50% reduction in BIN1 expression influenced cerebral amyloid burden, we crossed Bin1+/− mice to the 5XFAD line to generate 5XFAD mice with a single Bin1 allele deletion (5XFADBin1+/−) and littermates with normal BIN1 levels (5XFAD). The cerebral amyloid burden was assessed in females (Fig. 2A) and males (Fig. S2A) at 4 months of age with mAb 3D6 and thioflavin S staining in the hemibrain sections and in smaller hippocampal and cortex regions. It has previously been reported that in the 5XFAD line, females develop pathology at an earlier time point than males because of the presence of an estrogen response element in the transgene Thy-1 promoter (33Oakley H.

Quantitative analysis of hemibrains from female 5XFAD and 5XFADBin1+/− mice revealed no significant difference in the area covered with thioflavin S–positive fibrillary Aβ deposits (1.25 ± 0.161% in 5XFAD versus 1.208 ± 0.151% in 5XFADBin1+/−) (Fig. 2B). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in the area covered by mAb 3D6–positive deposits (7.29 ± 0.437% in 5XFAD versus 7.14 ± 0.998% in 5XFADBin1+/−) (Fig. 2C). Separate regional analysis of the hippocampus and cortex showed no significant difference in deposit coverage with thioflavin S (Fig. S1A) or mAb 3D6 immunofluorescence (Fig. S1B). A small but statistically significant difference was observed in average mAb 3D6 deposit size between female 5XFAD and 5XFADBin1+/− mice (931.7 ± 62.21 μm2 versus 746 ± 32.42 μm2) (Fig. S1C). Consistent with previous reports, male 5XFAD mice showed reduced amyloid burden as compared with female littermates. However, no significant differences were observed in the amyloid burden of male 5XFAD and 5XFADBin1+/− mice when thioflavin S– (0.68 ± 0.089% versus 0.53 ± 0.111%) (Fig. S2B) or mAb 3D6–positive deposits were quantified (5.79 ± 0.73% versus 4.22 ± 0.84%) (Fig. S2C) in the whole hemisphere or in hippocampal or cortex subregions. ELISA analysis of homogenates from female mice revealed no significant differences in soluble Aβ40 (119.6 ± 19.9 pg/mg in 5XFAD versus 89.24 ± 17.37 pg/mg in 5XFADBin1+/−) or Aβ42 levels (10.95 ± 1.143 pg/mg in 5XFAD versus 8.66 ± 0.78 pg/mg in 5XFADBin1+/−) (Fig. 2D). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in soluble Aβ40 (69.05 ± 15.75 pg/mg in 5XFAD versus 60.67 ± 7.894 pg/mg in 5XFADBin1+/−) or Aβ42 (9.28 ± 1.418 pg/mg in 5XFAD versus 8.592 ± 0.7668 in 5XFADBin1+/−) in male cohorts (Fig. S2D). Levels of soluble Aβ38 were below the detection threshold for the assay employed. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in insoluble Aβ40 (19,194 ± 2954 pg/mg in 5XFAD versus 14,518 ± 2339 pg/mg in 5XFADBin1+/−) or in Aβ42 (14,4273 ± 19,325 pg/mg in 5XFAD versus 112,617 ± 15,263 in 5XFADBin1+/−) in female mice (Fig. 2E). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in insoluble Aβ40 (7115 ± 1040 pg/mg in 5XFAD versus 7046 ± 1353 in 5XFADBin1+/−) or Aβ42 (62,495 ± 8385 pg/mg in 5XFAD versus 66,481 ± 10,572 in 5XFADBin1+/−) in male mice (Fig. S2D). Forebrain lysates from female (Fig. 2F) or male (Fig. S2E) mice were subjected to immunoblot analysis for APP, BACE1, GFAP, and Amph1. No significant differences were observed in protein levels when comparing female 5XFAD and 5XFADBin1+/− mice (Fig. 2G). A statistically significant 16% increase in BACE1 protein levels was observed in male 5XFADBin1+/− compared with 5XFAD controls, but no significant change in APP, Amph1, or GFAP was observed (Fig. S2F). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the levels of C-terminal fragments derived from BACE1 cleavage of APP (β-CTF) in female (Fig. 2H) or male (Fig. S2G) mice. We performed behavioral tests in 5XFAD and 5XFADBin1+/−mice to determine whether the partial loss of BIN1 expression influenced the previously reported cognitive dysfunctions in the 5XFAD line in the absence of a change of cerebral amyloid burden. In the elevated-plus maze, designed to test anxiety phenotypes, no significant differences between the groups were observed in the percentage of time spent in open arms of the maze in female (Fig. 3A) or male mice (Fig. S3A). Novel object recognition, Y-maze, and contextual fear conditioning paradigms were used to test cognitive deficits in 5XFAD and 5XFADBin1+/− mice. No significant differences were observed in the discrimination index in female (Fig. 3B) or male cohorts (Fig. S3B). Similarly, in the Y-maze test, no significant difference in the number of arm entries or spontaneous alternation was observed in female (Fig. 3, C and D) or male mice (Fig. S3, C and D). In contextual fear conditioning, response to the initial shock was not significantly different between genotypes in female (Fig. 3E) or male (Fig. S3E) mice, nor was freezing behavior 24 h later upon reintroduction to the fear conditioning chamber (Fig. 3F and Fig. S3F). Thus, the partial loss of BIN1 expression in 5XFAD mice does not influence the anxiety or memory performance in behavior tests. Previous reports showed a role for BIN1 in Aβ generation and BACE1 trafficking in primary neuronal cultures (26Miyagawa T. Ebinuma I. Morohashi Y. Hori Y. Young Chang M. Hattori H. Maehara T.

However, it was also reported that the knockdown or the overexpression of BIN1 in human neuroblastoma cells had no effect on APP processing (9Glennon E.B. Whitehouse I.J. Miners J.S. Kehoe P.G. Love S. Kellett K.A. Hooper N.M.

To test whether the select loss of BIN1 expression in neurons influences amyloidogenic processing of APP in vivo, we used the Synapsin1-Cre driver to generate neuronal Bin1 cKO mice (Bin1Fl/Fl:Syn-Cre). By crossing female Bin1Fl/Fl:Syn-Cre to male Bin1Fl/Fl mice, we avoided germline Bin1 deletion encountered in offspring generated with male Syn-Cre breeders (31Rempe D. Vangeison G. Hamilton J. Li Y. Jepson M. Federoff H.J.

The cKO mice showed a significant reduction in BIN1 levels in the cortex and hippocampus as compared with littermate controls (Fig. 4A). Quantification showed greater than 50% reduction in both high and low molecular weight BIN1 isoforms (Fig. 4B). To visualize BIN1 expression, we performed immunohistochemical staining using BIN1 mAb 13463 in the absence of epitope retrieval of tissue sections, which preferentially labels neuronal BIN1 (Fig. S4). As expected, a marked diminution of neuronal BIN1 immunostaining could be observed in the hippocampus of Syn-Cre Bin1 cKO mice (Fig. 4C).

https://openalex.org/W2914599810,"Different ecosystem models often provide contrasting predictions (model uncertainty), which is perceived to be a major challenge impeding their use to support ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). The focus of this manuscript is to examine the extent of model disagreements which could impact management advice for EBFM in the central Baltic Sea. We compare how much three models (EwE, Gadget and a multispecies stock production model) differ in 1) their estimates of fishing mortality rates (Fs) satisfying alternative hypothetical management scenario objectives and 2) the outcomes of those scenarios in terms of performance indicators (spawning stock biomasses, catches, profits). Uncertainty in future environmental conditions affecting fish was taken into account by considering two seal population growth scenarios and two nutrient load scenarios. Differences in the development of the stocks, yields and profits exist among the models but the general patterns are also sufficiently similar to appear promising in the context of strategic fishery advice. Thus, we suggest that disagreements among the ecosystem models will not impede their use for providing strategic advice on how to reach management objectives that go beyond the traditional maximum yield targets and for informing on the potential consequences of pursuing such objectives. This is especially true for scenarios aiming at exploiting forage fish sprat and herring, for which the agreement was the largest among our models. However, the quantitative response to altering fishing pressure differed among models. This was due to the diverse environmental covariates and the different number of trophic relationships and their functional forms considered in the models. This suggests that ecosystem models can be used to provide quantitative advice only after more targeted research is conducted to gain a deeper understanding into the relationship between trophic links and fish population dynamics in the Baltic Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2911275491,"Biofilm formation in the clinical environment is of increasing concern since a significant part of human infections is associated, and caused by biofilm establishment of (opportunistic) pathogens, for instance Candida albicans and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The rapidly increasing number of antibiotic-resistant biofilms urgently requires the development of novel and effective strategies to prevent biofilm formation ideally targeting a wide range of infectious microorganisms. Both, synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances and quorum sensing are crucial for biofilm formation, and thus potential attractive targets to combat undesirable biofilms.We evaluated the ability of numerous recently identified metagenome-derived bacterial quorum quenching (QQ) proteins to inhibit biofilm formation of C. albicans and S. epidermidis. Here, proteins QQ-5 and QQ-7 interfered with the morphogenesis of C. albicans by inhibiting the yeast-to-hyphae transition, ultimately leading to impaired biofilm formation. Moreover, QQ5 and QQ-7 inhibited biofilm formation of S. epidermidis; in case of QQ7 most likely due to induced expression of the icaR gene encoding the repressor for polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) synthesis, the main determinant for staphylococcal biofilm formation. Our results indicate that QQ-5 and QQ-7 are attractive potential anti-biofilm agents in the prevention and treatment of C. albicans and S. epidermidis mono-species biofilms, and potentially promising anti-biofilm drugs in also combating multi-species infections."
https://openalex.org/W2912488220,"Conophylline (CnP), a vinca alkaloid extracted from the leaves of the tropical plant Tabernaemontana divaricate, attenuates hepatic fibrosis in mice. We have previously shown that CnP inhibits non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) using a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mouse model. However, little is known about the CnP mediated inhibition of hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mouse models. CnP (0.5 and 1 μg/g/body weight) was co-administered along with a high-fat diet to male BALB/c mice. After nine weeks of administering the high-fat diet, hepatic steatosis, triglyceride, and hepatic fat metabolism-related markers were examined. Administration of a high-fat diet for 9 weeks was found to induce hepatic steatosis. CnP dose-dependently attenuated the high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. The diet also attenuated hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) mRNA levels. PPARA is known to be involved in β-oxidation. CnP upregulated the mRNA levels of hepatic PPARA and its target genes, such as carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) and CPT2, in a dose-dependent manner in the liver. Furthermore, levels of hepatic β-hydroxybutyrate, which is a type of ketone body, were increased by CnP in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, CnP increased the expression of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II and decreased the expression of p62, which are known to be selectively degraded during autophagy. These results indicate that CnP inhibits hepatic steatosis through the stimulation of β-oxidation and autophagy in the liver. Therefore, CnP might prove to be a suitable therapeutic target for NAFLD."

The biological relevance of SPA4 peptide was evaluated in a mouse model of acute lung infection induced by intratracheal challenge with P. aeruginosa. Our results demonstrate that the SPA4 peptide does not interact with or kill P. aeruginosa when cultured outside the host. The SPA4 peptide treatment induces the uptake and localization of bacteria in the phagolysosomes of immune cells. At the same time, the secreted amounts of TNF-α are significantly reduced in cell-free supernatants of SPA4 peptide-treated cells. In cells overexpressing TLR4, the TLR4-induced phagocytic response is maintained, but the levels of TLR4-stimulated TNF-α are reduced. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the therapeutic administration of SPA4 peptide reduces bacterial burden, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, intracellular signaling, and lactate levels, and alleviates lung edema and tissue damage in P. aeruginosa-infected mice. Together, our results suggest that the treatment with SPA4 peptide can help control the bacterial burden, inflammation, and tissue injury in a P. aeruginosa lung infection model."
https://openalex.org/W2912684486,"Neutrophils display rapid and potent innate immune responses in various diseases. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) however either induce or overcome immunosuppressive functions of the tumor microenvironment through complex tumor-stroma crosstalk. We developed a mathematical model to address the question of how phenotypic alterations between tumor suppressive N1 TANS, and tumor promoting N2 TANs affect nonlinear tumor growth in a complex tumor microenvironment. The model provides a visual display of the complex behavior of populations of TANs and tumors in response to various TGF-β and IFN-β stimuli. In addition, the effect of anti-tumor drug administration is incorporated in the model in an effort to achieve optimal anti-tumor efficacy. The simulation results from the mathematical model were in good agreement with experimental data. We found that the N2-to-N1 ratio (N21R) index is positively correlated with aggressive tumor growth, suggesting that this may be a good prognostic factor. We also found that the antitumor efficacy increases when the relative ratio (Dap) of delayed apoptotic cell death of N1 and N2 TANs is either very small or relatively large, providing a basis for therapeutically targeting prometastatic N2 TANs."

The impact of stroke in local population was also evaluated by comparing the pre- and post-stroke HRQoL with that of the general population.The HRQoL of stroke survivors was assessed with the EQ-5D-3L index score at recruitment, for recalled pre-stroke HRQoL, and at 3 and 12 month post-stroke. Change in HRQoL from pre-stroke to 3 and 12 month was self-reported by 285 and 238 patients, respectively. Mean EQ index score at each time point (baseline: 464 patients; 3 month post-stroke: 306 patients; 12 month post-stroke: 258 patients) was compared with published population norms for EQ-5D-3L.There was a significant decrease in HRQoL at 3 (0.25) and 12 month (0.09) post-stroke when compared to the retrospectively recalled patients' mean pre-stroke HRQoL level (0.87). The reduction at 3 month was associated with the reduction in all EQ-5D-3L health dimensions; reductions remaining at 12 month were limited to dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, and anxiety/depression. Stroke patients had a lower mean EQ index than the general population by 0.07 points pre-stroke (0.87 vs. 0.94), 0.33 points at 3 month (0.61 vs. 0.94) and 0.18 points at 12 month (0.76 vs. 0.94) post-stroke.Stroke has a substantial impact on HRQoL in Singapore, especially in the first three months post-stroke. Compared to the general population, stroke survivors have lower HRQoL even before stroke onset. This pre-stroke deficit in HRQoL should be taken into account when quantifying health burden of stroke or setting goals for stroke rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2913579428,"3-Methylindole (3MI) or Skatole is a volatile lipophilic organic compound produced by anoxic metabolism of L-tryptophan and associated with animal farming and industrial processing wastes. Pure cultures of bacteria capable of utilizing 3MI were isolated from chicken manure using enrichment culture techniques. The bacteria were identified as Acinetobacter toweneri NTA1-2A and Acinetobacter guillouiae TAT1-6A, based on 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequence data. The optimal temperature and pH for degradation of 3MI were established using single factor experiments. Strain tolerance was assessed over a range of initial concentrations of 3MI, and the effects of initial concentration on subsequent microbial 3MI degradation were also measured. During the degradation experiment, concentrations of 3MI were quantified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The strains were capable of degrade initial concentrations of 3MI ranging from 65–200 mg/L. The degradation efficiency was >85% in 6 days for both strains when the initial concentration is less than 200 mg/L. The strains were tested for enzymatic activity using 65 mg/L 3MI. The enzyme extracts of NTA1-2A and TAT1-6A from the 3MI medium degraded 71.46% and 60.71% of 3MI respectively, but no appreciable change in 3MI concentration in the control group was witnessed. Our experiment revealed betaine and choline were identified as 3MI degradation metabolites by both strains while nitroso-pyrrolidine and beta-alaninebetaine formed by NTA1-2A and TAT1-6A strains respectively. The NTA1-2A and TAT1-6A strains removed 84.32% and 81.39% 3MI respectively from chicken manure during fermentation in 8 days and showed a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. The optimum temperature and pH were 31°C and 6 respectively, for 3MI degradation by A. toweneri NTA1-2A and A. guillouiae TAT1-6A. We concluded that A. toweneri NTA1-2A and A. guillouiae TAT1-6A are potential strains of interest to degrade 3MI and control odorant in poultry and other livestock industries."

However, we are not aware of any research that has combined these approaches among SMM, highlighting the need for acceptability and feasibility research. The purpose of this study was to examine the acceptability of implementing GPS and EMA research protocols using smartphone applications among SMM as well as related socio-demographic correlates.Data come from a sample of SMM on a popular geosocial-networking app in Paris, France (n = 580). We assessed the acceptability of implementing GPS and EMA research protocols on smartphone apps as well as socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sexual orientation, country of origin, employment status, and relationship status). We examined the anticipated acceptability of GPS and EMA data collection methods as well as socio-demographic correlates of acceptability of GPS and EMA methods.We found that over half (54.1%) of the sample was willing to download a smartphone app for GPS-based research and we found that almost 60% of the participants were willing to download a smartphone app for EMA-based research. In total, 44.0% reported that they were willing to download both GPS and EMA apps. In addition, we found that older participants were less willing to download a smartphone app for EMA research than younger participants aged 18-24 (40-49 years: aPR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.20, 0.78) and students were more willing to download smartphone apps for both GPS and EMA research (aPR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.95).Results from this study suggest that using smartphone apps to implement GPS and EMA methods among some SMM are acceptable. However, care should be taken as segments of SMM are less likely to be willing to engage in this type of research."

The primary endpoint was percentage change in limb fat at week 96. Secondary endpoints were associations among these changes and metabolic markers (IL-6, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, FGF-23).126 subjects (61 DRV/r + RAL and 65 DRV/r + TDF/FTC) were included. The rate of change in BMI between groups for RAL versus TDF/FTC at week 96 was 1.5% per 48-week period (p = 0.015).

Pathogenic mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum, have up to five of these systems, named ESX-1 to ESX-5. Most of these systems contain a set of five conserved membrane components, of which the four Ecc proteins form the core membrane-embedded secretion complex. The fifth conserved membrane protein, mycosin protease (MycP), is not part of the core complex but is essential for secretion, as it stabilizes this membrane complex. Here we investigated which MycP domains are required for this stabilization by producing hybrid constructs between MycP1 and MycP5 in M. marinum and analyzed their effect on ESX-1 and ESX-5 secretion. We found that both the protease and transmembrane domain are required for the ESX system-specific function of mycosins. In addition, we observed that the transmembrane domain strongly affects MycP protein levels. We also show that the extended loops 1 and 2 in the protease domain are probably primarily involved in MycP stability, whereas loop 3 and the MycP5-specific loop 5 are dispensable. The atypical propeptide, or N-terminal extension, is required only for MycP stability.

https://openalex.org/W2911649027,"In this paper, we pursue an alternative method to measure the Value Added Tax gap in the European Union using the stochastic tax frontier model. We use the Value Added Tax total tax liability as the input to estimate the optimal frontier of the Value Added Tax, as well as to predict technical inefficiency. Using the latest innovations of the stochastic frontier approach, we aim to obtain the accurate size of the Value Added Tax gap in the EU-26 countries and contrast them with extant estimates. The obtained estimates of the Value Added Tax gap using the stochastic tax frontier model are different from the estimates produced by the top-down method to calculate the Value Added Tax gap in the EU. Moreover, the stochastic tax frontier approach allows us to disentangle the Value Added Tax gap, which is time dependent, from the persistent Value Added Tax gap, which is country specific. The stochastic tax frontier model allows us to test the effect of exogenous factors on the technical inefficiency of the Value Added Tax and propose appropriate policy recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2913901079,"Patterned two-photon (2P) photolysis via holographic illumination is a powerful method to investigate neuronal function because of its capability to emulate multiple synaptic inputs in three dimensions (3D) simultaneously. However, like any optical system, holographic projectors have a finite space-bandwidth product that restricts the spatial range of patterned illumination or field-of-view (FOV) for a desired resolution. Such trade-off between holographic FOV and resolution restricts the coverage within a limited domain of the neuron’s dendritic tree to perform highly resolved patterned 2P photolysis on individual spines. Here, we integrate a holographic projector into a commercial 2P galvanometer-based 2D scanning microscope with an uncaging unit and extend the accessible holographic FOV by using the galvanometer scanning mirrors to reposition the holographic FOV arbitrarily across the imaging FOV. The projector system utilizes the microscope’s built-in imaging functions. Stimulation positions can be selected from within an acquired 3D image stack (the volume-of-interest, VOI) and the holographic projector then generates 3D illumination patterns with multiple uncaging foci. The imaging FOV of our system is 800×800 μm2 within which a holographic VOI of 70×70×70 μm3 can be chosen at arbitrary positions and also moved during experiments without moving the sample. We describe the design and alignment protocol as well as the custom software plugin that controls the 3D positioning of stimulation sites. We demonstrate the neurobiological application of the system by simultaneously uncaging glutamate at multiple spines within dendritic domains and consequently observing summation of postsynaptic potentials at the soma, eventually resulting in action potentials. At the same time, it is possible to perform two-photon Ca2+ imaging in 2D in the dendrite and thus to monitor synaptic Ca2+ entry in selected spines and also local regenerative events such as dendritic action potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2912725805,"It is known that local tissue injuries incurred by snakebites are quickly instilled causing extensive, irreversible, tissue destruction that may include loss of limb function or even amputation. Such injuries are not completely neutralized by the available antivenins, which in general are focused on halting systemic effects. Therefore it is prudent to investigate the potential antiophidic effects of natural and synthetic compounds, perhaps combining them with serum therapy, to potentially attenuate or eliminate the adverse local and systemic effects of snake venom. This study assessed a group of quinones that are widely distributed in nature and constitute an important class of natural products that exhibit a range of biological activities. Of these quinones, lapachol is one of the most important compounds, having been first isolated in 1882 from the bark of Tabebuia avellanedae.It was investigated the ability of lapachol and some new potential active analogues based on the 2-hydroxi-naphthoquinone scaffold to antagonize important activities of Bothrops venoms (Bothrops atrox and Bothrops jararaca) under different experimental protocols in vitro and in vivo. The bioassays used to test the compounds were: procoagulant, phospholipase A2, collagenase and proteolytic activities in vitro, venom-induced hemorrhage, edematogenic, and myotoxic effects in mice. Proteolytic and collagenase activities of Bothrops atrox venom were shown to be inhibited by lapachol and its analogues 3a, 3b, 3c, 3e. The inhibition of these enzymatic activities might help to explain the effects of the analogue 3a in vivo, which decreased skin hemorrhage induced by Bothrops venom. Lapachol and the synthetic analogues 3a and 3b did not inhibit the myotoxic activity induced by Bothrops atrox venom. The negative protective effect of these compounds against the myotoxicity can be partially explained by their lack of ability to effectively inhibit phospholipase A2 venom activity. Bothrops atrox venom also induced edema, which was significantly reduced by the analogue 3a.This research using a natural quinone and some related synthetic quinone compounds has shown that they exhibit antivenom activity; especially the compound 3a. The data from 3a showed a decrease in inflammatory venom effects, presumably those that are metalloproteinase-derived. Its ability to counteract such snake venom activities contributes to the search for improving the management of venomous snakebites."

Recently, associations between metabolic disorders and pulmonary hypertension have also been reported in both humans and animal models. In order to get some further insight into the relationship of pulmonary hypertension with obesity, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, herein we have used the Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/clr-lepr fa) at 20 weeks fed a standard diet and compared to their lean Zucker littermates (ZL). ZDF rats were obese, had elevated plasma glucose levels and insulin resistance, i.e. a clinically relevant model of type 2 diabetes. They presented elevated systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary arterial pressures and a parallel increase in the Fulton index. Systemic arterial pressures were also increased but the left ventricle plus septum weight was similar in both groups and the heart rate was reduced. Wall media thickening was observed in the small pulmonary arteries from the ZDF rats. Isolated pulmonary arteries mounted in a wire myograph showed similar vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine and 5-HT and similar responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine. However, the iNOS inhibitor 1400W enhanced the vasoconstrictor responses in ZDF but not in ZL rats. The protein expression of eNOS and iNOS was not significantly different in the lungs of the two groups. The lung expression of Bmpr2 mRNA was downregulated. However, the mRNA expression of Kcna5, Kcnk3, Kcnq1, Kcnq4 or Kcnq5, which encode for the potassium channels Kv1.5, TASK-1, Kv7.1, Kv7.4 and Kv7.5, respectively, was similar in ZL and ZDF rats. In conclusion, ZDF rats show increased pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary arterial medial thickening and downregulated lung Bmpr2 despite leptin resistance. These changes were mild but are consistent with the view that diabetes is a risk factor for pulmonary hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2913761120,"A defective homologous recombination (HR) repair program increases tumor incidence as well as providing a survival advantage in patients with breast and ovarian cancers. Here we hypothesize that the tumor-promoting side of genome maintenance programs may be contributed by a self-renewal protein, nucleostemin (NS). To address this issue, we established its functional importance in mammary tumor progression in mice and showed that mammary tumor cells become highly susceptible to replicative DNA damage following NS depletion and are protected from hydroxyurea-induced damage by NS overexpression. Breast cancer cells with basal-like characters display more reliance on NS for genome maintenance than those with luminal characters. Mechanistically, NS-deficient cells demonstrate a significantly reduced HR repair activity. TCGA analyses of human breast cancers revealed that NS is co-enriched positively with HR repair proteins and that high NS expression correlates with low HR defects and predicts poor progression-free survival and resistance to knockdown of cell-cycle checkpoint genes in triple-negative/basal-like breast cancers. This work indicates that NS constitutes a tumor-promoting genome maintenance program required for mammary tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2912161596,"In an incident hemodialysis (HD) population, we aimed to investigate whether arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation before HD initiation was associated with improved AVF patency compared with AVF creation from a central venous catheter (CVC), and also to compare patient survival between these patients. Between January 2011 and December 2013, 524 incident HD patients with identified first predialysis vascular access with an AVF (pre-HD group, n = 191) or an AVF from a CVC (on-HD group, n = 333) were included and analyzed retrospectively. The study outcome was defined as AVF patency and all-cause mortality (time to death). On Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, primary and secondary AVF patency rates did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.812 and P = 0.586, respectively), although the overall survival rate was significantly higher in the pre-HD group compared with the on-HD group (P = 0.013). On multivariate analysis, well-known patient factors were associated with decreased primary (older age and diabetes mellitus [DM]) and secondary (DM and peripheral arterial occlusive disease) AVF patency, whereas use of a CVC as the initial predialysis access (hazard ratios, 1.84; 95% confidence intervals, 1.20–2.75; P = 0.005) was significantly associated with worse survival in addition to well-known patient factors (older age, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease). Worse survival in the on-HD group was likely confounded by selection bias because of the retrospective nature of our study. Therefore, the observed lower mortality associated with AVF creation before HD initiation is not fully attributable to CVC use, but rather, affected by other patient-level prognostic factors. There were no CVC-related complications in the pre-HD group, whereas 10.2% of CVC-related complications were noted in the on-HD group. In conclusion, among incident HD patients, compared with patients who underwent creation of an AVF from a CVC, initial AVF creation showed similar primary and secondary AVF patency rates, but lower mortality risk. We also observed that an initial CVC use was an independent risk factor associated with worse survival. A fistula-first strategy might be the best option for incident HD patients who are good candidates for AVF creation."
https://openalex.org/W2911408036,"Agricultural intensification and shifts in precipitation regimes due to global climate change are expected to increase nutrient concentrations in aquatic ecosystems. However, the direct effects of nutrients widely present in wastewaters, such as nitrate, are poorly studied. Here, we use multiple indicators of fish health to experimentally test the effects of three ecologically relevant nitrate concentrations (<10, 50 and 250 mg NO3-/l) on wild-collected mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a species widely introduced for mosquito biocontrol in often eutrophic waters. Overall, biomarkers (histopathology, feeding assays, growth and caloric content and stable isotopes as indicators of energy content) did not detect overt signs of serious disease in juveniles, males or females of mosquitofish. However, males reduced food intake at the highest nitrate concentration compared to the controls and females. Similarly, juveniles reduced energy reserves without significant changes in growth or food intake. Calorimetry was positively associated with the number of perivisceral fat cells in juveniles, and the growth rate of females was negatively associated with δ15N signature in muscle. This study shows that females are more tolerant to nitrate than males and juveniles and illustrates the advantages of combing short- and long-term biomarkers in environmental risk assessment, including when testing for the adequacy of legal thresholds for pollutants."

Design, setting and participants Thirty healthy (22 ± 1 years) men were subjected to 7 days of one-legged knee immobilization by means of a full leg cast with (NAD, n = 15) or without (CON, n = 15) prior intramuscular nandrolone decanoate injection (200 mg). Measures Before and immediately after immobilization, quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) (by means of single-slice computed tomography (CT) scans of the upper leg) and one-legged knee extension strength (one-repetition maximum [1-RM]) were assessed for both legs. Furthermore, muscle biopsies from the immobilized leg were taken before and after immobilization to assess type I and type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Results Quadriceps muscle CSA decreased during immobilization in both CON and NAD (-6 ± 1% and -6 ± 1%, respectively; main effect of time P<0.01), with no differences between the groups (time × treatment interaction, P = 0.59). Leg muscle strength declined following immobilization (-6 ± 2% in CON and -7 ± 3% in NAD; main effect of time, P<0.05), with no differences between groups (time × treatment interaction, P = 0.55). Conclusions This is the first study to report that nandrolone decanoate administration does not preserve skeletal muscle mass and strength during a short period of leg immobilization in vivo in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2914416894,"In marine ecosystems, maximum sustainable yield considerations are affected by any substantial changes that occur in the top and bottom compartments of the food-web. This study explores how the southern North Sea’s fisheries may need to adjust their fishing efforts to maintain optimum yields of sole, plaice, cod and brown shrimps under increased marine mammal populations and a reduced primary productivity. We constructed plausible scenarios of ongoing food-web changes using the results of Bayesian age-structured population models to estimate carrying capacities of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). Losses in primary productivity were predicted by lower trophic level ecosystem models. These scenarios were implemented in a food-web model of the southern North Sea. For each scenario, we sought mixed-fleet fishing efforts that would deliver maximum yields of sole, plaice, cod and brown shrimp combined. We also did so for a baseline run with unaltered mammal and primary production, and compared the differences in optimal fishing strategies, predicted yields, and states of the stocks between the scenarios. We found stocks and yields to be far more sensitive to changes in primary productivity than to increased marine mammal predation. The latter predominantly impacted cod, and even benefitted brown shrimps compared to the baseline run. Under 30% reduced primary productivity, fishing efforts had to be reduced by 50% to still provide maximum yields, whereas the marine mammal scenario induced no need to adjust the fishing regime. This draws attention to the potential gains of incorporating bottom-up processes into long-term management considerations, while marine mammal predation may be less of a concern, in particular for flatfish fisheries in the North Sea, and may even benefit shrimp trawlers because of reduced predation on shrimp from fish predators."
https://openalex.org/W2885101764,"The advent of social networks revolutionized the way people access to information sources. Understanding the complex relationship between these sources and users is crucial. We introduce an algorithm, that we call PopRank, to assess both the Impact of Facebook pages as well as users’ Engagement on the basis of their mutual interactions. The ideas behind the PopRank are that i) high impact pages attract many users with a low engagement, which means that they receive comments from users that rarely comment, and ii) high engagement users interact with high impact pages, that is they mostly comment pages with a high popularity. The resulting ranking of pages can predict the number of comments a page will receive and the number of its future posts. Pages’ impact turns out to be slightly dependent on the quality of pages’ informative content (e.g., science vs conspiracy) but independent of users’ polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2912573266,"We introduce a dataset for studying the evolution of words, constructed from WordNet and the Google Books Ngram Corpus. The dataset tracks the evolution of 4,000 synonym sets (synsets), containing 9,000 English words, from 1800 AD to 2000 AD. We present a supervised learning algorithm that is able to predict the future leader of a synset: the word in the synset that will have the highest frequency. The algorithm uses features based on a word's length, the characters in the word, and the historical frequencies of the word. It can predict change of leadership (including the identity of the new leader) fifty years in the future, with an F-score considerably above random guessing. Analysis of the learned models provides insight into the causes of change in the leader of a synset. The algorithm confirms observations linguists have made, such as the trend to replace the -ise suffix with -ize, the rivalry between the -ity and -ness suffixes, and the struggle between economy (shorter words are easier to remember and to write) and clarity (longer words are more distinctive and less likely to be confused with one another). The results indicate that integration of the Google Books Ngram Corpus with WordNet has significant potential for improving our understanding of how language evolves."
https://openalex.org/W2915023799,"Therapeutic modulation of protein interactions is challenging, but short linear motifs (SLiMs) represent potential targets. Focal adhesions play a central role in adhesion by linking cells to the extracellular matrix. Integrins are central to this process, and many other intracellular proteins are components of the integrin adhesome. We applied a peptide network targeting approach to explore the intracellular modulation of integrin function in platelets. Firstly, we computed a platelet-relevant integrin adhesome, inferred via homology of known platelet proteins to adhesome components. We then computationally selected peptides from the set of platelet integrin adhesome cytoplasmic and membrane adjacent protein-protein interfaces. Motifs of interest in the intracellular component of the platelet integrin adhesome were identified using a predictor of SLiMs based on analysis of protein primary amino acid sequences (SLiMPred), a predictor of strongly conserved motifs within disordered protein regions (SLiMPrints), and information from the literature regarding protein interactions in the complex. We then synthesized peptides incorporating these motifs combined with cell penetrating factors (tat peptide and palmitylation for cytoplasmic and membrane proteins respectively). We tested for the platelet activating effects of the peptides, as well as their abilities to inhibit activation. Bioactivity testing revealed a number of peptides that modulated platelet function, including those derived from α-actinin (ACTN1) and syndecan (SDC4), binding to vinculin and syntenin respectively. Both chimeric peptide experiments and peptide combination experiments failed to identify strong effects, perhaps characterizing the adhesome as relatively robust against within-adhesome synergistic perturbation. We investigated in more detail peptides targeting vinculin. Combined experimental and computational evidence suggested a model in which the positively charged tat-derived cell penetrating part of the peptide contributes to bioactivity via stabilizing charge interactions with a region of the ACTN1 negatively charged surface. We conclude that some interactions in the integrin adhesome appear to be capable of modulation by short peptides, and may aid in the identification and characterization of target sites within the complex that may be useful for therapeutic modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2911896364,"Early prediction of the potential for neurological recovery after resuscitation from cardiac arrest is difficult but important. Currently, no clinical finding or combination of findings are sufficient to accurately predict or preclude favorable recovery of comatose patients in the first 24 to 48 hours after resuscitation. Thus, life-sustaining therapy is often continued for several days in patients whose irrecoverable injury is not yet recognized. Conversely, early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy increases mortality among patients who otherwise might have gone on to recover. In this work, we present Canonical Autocorrelation Analysis (CAA) and Canonical Autocorrelation Embeddings (CAE), novel methods suitable for identifying complex patterns in high-resolution multivariate data often collected in highly monitored clinical environments such as intensive care units. CAE embeds sets of datapoints onto a space that characterizes their latent correlation structures and allows direct comparison of these structures through the use of a distance metric. The methodology may be particularly suitable when the unit of analysis is not just an individual datapoint but a dataset, as for instance in patients for whom physiological measures are recorded over time, and where changes of correlation patterns in these datasets are informative for the task at hand. We present a proof of concept to illustrate the potential utility of CAE by applying it to characterize electroencephalographic recordings from 80 comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, aiming to identify patients who will survive to hospital discharge with favorable functional recovery. Our results show that with very low probability of making a Type 1 error, we are able to identify 32.5% of patients who are likely to have a good neurological outcome, some of whom have otherwise unfavorable clinical characteristics. Importantly, some of these had 5% predicted chance of favorable recovery based on initial illness severity measures alone. Providing this information to support clinical decision-making could motivate the continuation of life-sustaining therapies for these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2912937763,"A large body of research has shown that self-referential processing can enhance an individual’s memory of information. However, there are many arguments about how self-referential processing affects directed forgetting (DF). In this study, two experiments were designed to investigate the DF effect and its internal psychological mechanism under explicit and implicit referential conditions using the item-method DF paradigm combined with the storage-retrieval MPT model. We compare the difference in the DF effect between self-referential and other-referential conditions and explain the reasons for the difference. Our results suggest that the item-method DF effect is the result of a selective rehearsal mechanism and a retrieval inhibition mechanism working together. Both self-reference and other-reference can cause DF in explicit referential processing or implicit referential processing, although the DF effect is stronger under the self-referential condition. Furthermore, the memory advantage effect of implicit self-referential processing is stronger than that of explicit self-referential processing."
https://openalex.org/W2914309643,"The present study examined the internal and external validity of the French version of the 12-item Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised (DPSS-12) in a nonclinical sample from the general population. Two hundred and eighty-two participants completed the DPSSf-12 questionnaire as well as the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), Anxiety Trait (STAI B), Obsessional Belief Questionnaire 44 items (OBQ 44), Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported a 2-factor structure after two sensitivity items were removed. The 10-item scale showed good internal consistency, construct validity and test-retest reliability. These adequate psychometric properties make the DPSSf-10 appropriate for use by researchers and practitioners."
https://openalex.org/W2911443174,"Understanding expression levels of proteins and their interactions is a key factor to diagnose and explain the Down syndrome which can be considered as the most prevalent reason of intellectual disability in human beings. In the previous studies, the expression levels of 77 proteins obtained from normal genotype control mice and from trisomic Ts65Dn mice have been analyzed after training in contextual fear conditioning with and without injection of the memantine drug using statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Recent studies have also pointed out that there may be a linkage between the Down syndrome and the immune system. Thus, the research presented in this paper aim at in silico identification of proteins which are significant to the learning process and the immune system and to derive the most accurate model for classification of mice. In this paper, the features are selected by implementing forward feature selection method after preprocessing step of the dataset. Later, deep neural network, gradient boosting tree, support vector machine and random forest classification methods are implemented to identify the accuracy. It is observed that the selected feature subsets not only yield higher accuracy classification results but also are composed of protein responses which are important for the learning and memory process and the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2914786966,"Insulin infusion is recommended during management of diabetic patients in critical care units to rapidly achieve glycaemic stability and reduce the mortality. The application of an easy-to-use standardized protocol, compatible with the workload is preferred. Glycaemic target must quickly be reached, therefore static algorithms should be replaced by dynamic ones. The dynamic algorithm seems closer to the physiological situation and appreciates insulin sensitivity. However, the protocol must meet both safety and efficiency requirements. Indeed, apprehension from hypoglycaemia is the main deadlock with the dynamic algorithms, thus their application remains limited. In contrary to the critical care units, to date, no prospective study evaluated a dynamic algorithm of insulin infusion in non-critically ill patients.This study primarily aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a dynamic algorithm of intravenous insulin therapy in non-critically-ill patients, and addressed its safety and feasibility in different departments of our university hospital.A ""before-after"" study was conducted in five hospital departments (endocrinology and four ""non-expert"" units) comparing a dynamic algorithm (during the ""after"" period-P2) to the static protocol (the ""before"" period-P1). Static protocol is based on determining insulin infusion according to an instant blood glycaemia (BG) level at a given time. In the dynamic algorithm, insulin infusion rate is determined according to the rate of change of the BG (the previous and actual BG under a specific insulin infusion rate). Additionally, two distinct glycaemic targets were defined according to the patients' profile: 100-180 mg/dl (5.5-10 mmol/l) for vigorous patients and 140-220 mg/dl (7.8-12.2 mmol/l) for frail ones. Different BG measurements for each patient were collected and recorded in a specific database (e-CRF) in order to analyse the rates of hypo- and hyperglycaemia. A satisfaction survey was also performed. A study approval was obtained from the institutional revision board before starting the study.Over 8 months, 72 and 66 patients during P1 and P2 were respectively included. The dynamic algorithm was more efficient, with reduced time to control hyperglycaemia (P1 vs P2:8.3 vs 5.3 hours; HR: 2.02 [1.27; 3.21]; p<0.01), increased the number of in-target BG measurements (P1 vs P2: 37.0% vs 41.8%; p<0.05), and reduced the glycaemic variability related to each patient (P1 vs P2, %CV: 40.9 vs 38.2;p<0.05, Index Correlation Class:0.30 vs 0.14; p<0.05). In patients after the first event of hypoglycemia after having started the infusion, new events were lower (P1 vs P2: 19.4 vs 11.4; p<0.001) thanks to an earlier reaction to hypoglycaemia (8.3% during P1 vs 44.3% during P2; p = 0.004). With the dynamic algorithm, the percentage of recurrence of mild hypoglycaemia was significantly lower in frail patients (20.5% vs 10.2%; p<0.001), and in patients managed in the non-expert units (18 vs 7.1%, p<0.001). The %CV was significantly improved in frail patients (36.9%). Mean BG measurements for each patient/day were 5.5±1.1 during P1 and 6.0±1.6 during P2 (p = 0.6). The threat from hypoglycaemia and the difficulty in using dynamic algorithm are barriers for nurses' adherence.This dynamic algorithm for non-critically-ill patients is more efficient and safe than the static protocol, and adapted for frail patients and non-expert units."
https://openalex.org/W2914491065,"A redescription of Corydoras undulatus Regan, 1912 is presented. The original description of C. undulatus is very succinct, as is its diagnosis, which is based only on external morphology. Additional information in the scientific literature on this species is scarce. Specimens from the distribution area of this species were analyzed; Paraná and Paraguay river basins in Argentina, Uruguay river basin in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and the Laguna dos Patos system in Brazil. Morphological analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), meristic comparison and osteological description were performed. Corydoras undulatus can be distinguished from its congeners mainly by having the following combination of characters: mesethmoid short, with anterior tip short, smaller than 50% of the entire bone length; posterior margin of the pectoral-fin spine with nearly all serrations directed towards origin of spine; pectoral-fin spine with conical serrations; and its peculiar color pattern. The analysis of the material from the different basins did not indicate relevant morphological differences, suggesting that the species presents a wide distribution in La Plata and Laguna dos Patos drainages. The shared geographic distribution between these two systems is also present in other fish species. The current work presents data about the type locality, taxonomy, osteology, distribution and ontogenetic variation of color pattern in C. undulatus. Comments on the identity of a very similar congener, Corydoras latus, will also be provided."
