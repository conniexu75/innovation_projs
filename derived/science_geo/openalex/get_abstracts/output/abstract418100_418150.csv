https://openalex.org/W2037533858,"Cerebral deposition of amyloid β protein (Aβ) is an invariant feature of Alzheimer disease (AD), and epidemiological evidence suggests that moderate consumption of foods enriched with phenolic compounds reduce the incidence of AD. We reported previously that the phenolic compounds myricetin (Myr) and rosmarinic acid (RA) inhibited Aβ aggregation in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate a mechanistic basis for these results, we analyzed the effects of five phenolic compounds in the Aβ aggregation process and in oligomer-induced synaptic toxicities. We now report that the phenolic compounds blocked Aβ oligomerization, and Myr promoted significant NMR chemical shift changes of monomeric Aβ. Both Myr and RA reduced cellular toxicity and synaptic dysfunction of the Aβ oligomers. These results suggest that Myr and RA may play key roles in blocking the toxicity and early assembly processes associated with Aβ through different binding."

Full sibling fish from four unrelated families, each consisting of individuals derived from the mating of one male and one female belonging to a breeding program, were fed diets containing either vegetable proteins or vegetable oils for two months in comparison to a control diet consisting of only fish protein and fish oil. Two parallel approaches were applied on the same samples: transcriptionally active bacterial populations were examined based on RNA analysis and were compared with bacterial populations obtained from DNA analysis. Comparison of temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) profiles from DNA and RNA showed important differences, indicating that active bacterial populations were better described by RNA analysis. Results showed that some bacterial groups were significantly (P<0.05) associated with specific families, indicating that microbiota composition may be influenced by the host. In addition, the effect of diet on microbiota composition was dependent on the trout family."
https://openalex.org/W2066657308,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which binding of pathogenic autoantibodies (NMO-IgG) to astrocyte aquaporin-4 (AQP4) causes complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and inflammation. We previously reported a wide range of binding affinities of NMO-IgGs to AQP4 in separate tetramers versus intramembrane aggregates (orthogonal arrays of particles, OAPs). We report here a second, independent mechanism by which CDC is affected by AQP4 assembly. Utilizing lactate dehydrogenase release and live/dead cell cytotoxicity assays, we found in different cell lines, and with different monoclonal and patient-derived NMO-IgGs, that CDC was greatly (>100-fold) reduced in cells expressing M1- versus M23-AQP4. Studies using a M23-AQP4 mutant containing an OAP-disrupting mutation, and in cells expressing AQP4 in different M1/M23 ratios, indicated that NMO-IgG-dependent CDC requires AQP4 OAP assembly. In contrast, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity produced by natural killer cells did not depend on AQP4 OAP assembly. Measurements of C1q binding and complement attack complex (C9neo) supported the conclusion that the greatly enhanced CDC by OAPs is due to efficient, multivalent binding of C1q to clustered NMO-IgG on OAPs. We conclude that AQP4 assembly in OAPs is required for CDC in NMO, establishing a new mechanism of OAP-dependent NMO pathogenesis. Disruption of AQP4 OAPs may greatly reduce NMO-IgG dependent CDC and NMO pathology.

Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) may also be involved. Current NMO therapies target the NMO-IgG load and inflammatory reaction (15Cree B.A. Lamb S. Morgan K. Chen A. Waubant E.

We recently introduced a monoclonal antibody (“aquaporumab”) strategy to treat NMO in which a tight-binding, nonpathogenic anti-AQP4 antibody blocks NMO-IgG binding to AQP4 (17Tradtrantip L. Zhang H.

The target of the NMO autoantibody, AQP4, forms supramolecular assemblies in membranes called orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) (18Landis D.M. Reese T.S.

We discovered the involvement of AQP4 in OAPs by showing OAPs in AQP4-transfected cells (20Hasegawa H. Ma T. Skach W. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S.

Absence of orthogonal arrays in kidney, brain, and muscle from transgenic knockout mice lacking water channel aquaporin-4.J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2855-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that NMO-IgG binding to AQP4 can be quite different when AQP4 is present in membranes as separate tetramers versus OAPs (23Crane J.M. Lam C. Rossi A. Gupta T. Bennett J.L. Verkman A.S. Binding affinity and specificity of neuromyelitis optica autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 M1/M23 isoforms and orthogonal arrays.J. Biol.

Binding measurements were done using polyclonal NMO-IgG in NMO patient sera, as well as monoclonal recombinant NMO antibodies (NMO-rAb) derived from clonally expanded plasma blasts in cerebrospinal fluid of NMO patients. Although some antibodies bound similarly to AQP4 tetramers and OAPs, most antibodies bound with substantially higher affinity to AQP4 OAPs than tetramers. Mutagenesis studies and measurements of NMO-Fab binding suggested that OAP assembly causes a conformational change at the external AQP4 surface that influences NMO-IgG binding (23Crane J.M. Lam C. Rossi A. Gupta T. Bennett J.L. Verkman A.S. Binding affinity and specificity of neuromyelitis optica autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 M1/M23 isoforms and orthogonal arrays.J. Biol.

Here, we investigated the role of OAP assembly by AQP4 in NMO-IgG-dependent cell killing by complement and natural killer cells, testing the hypothesis that efficient CDC requires OAP formation by AQP4 but that ADCC does not. The motivation for this study is the known multivalent interaction of complement protein C1q with antibody Fc region (25Sledge C.R. Bing D.H. Binding properties of the human complement protein C1q.J.

We found greatly increased CDC for OAP-assembled AQP4, establishing a second mechanism by which NMO pathology is influenced by AQP4 assembly, independent of NMO-IgG binding. DNA constructs encoding full-length human AQP4 (M1 and M23 isoforms) and the M23 mutant G28P were generated and cloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1, as described (28Crane J.M. Rossi A.

CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CCL-61) were stably transfected with M1- and M23-AQP4 as described (21Yang B. Brown D. Verkman A.S.

For transient transfections, U87MG cells were plated onto 96-well microplates (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and transfected in antibiotic-free medium using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were done 24 h after transfection. Human natural killer (NK) cells stably transfected with the Fc receptor CD16 (CD16-176V-NK92, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) were cultured in α Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% horse serum, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.5 μm folic acid, 0.2 mm myo-inositol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 IU of human recombinant IL-2 (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). NMO patient IgG (denoted NMO-IgG) was purified from serum of three NMO patients using a Melon gel IgG purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Recombinant monoclonal NMO antibodies (NMO-rAb; rAb-53; rAb-58) were generated from clonally expanded plasma blasts in cerebrospinal fluid of seropositive NMO patients as described (9Bennett J.L. Lam C. Kalluri S.R. Saikali P. Bautista K. Dupree C. Glogowska M. Case D. Antel J.P. Owens G.P. Gilden D. Nessler S. Stadelmann C. Hemmer B. Intrathecal pathogenic anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies in early neuromyelitis optica.Ann. Neurol. 2009; 66: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). A non-NMO rAb (rAb-2B4) against measles virus nucleocapsid protein was used as a negative control antibody. AQP4-expressing U87MG or CHO-K1 cells were incubated for 20 min in live cell blocking buffer (PBS containing 6 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% goat serum) and then for 30 min with NMO-IgG or NMO-rAb in blocking buffer, as described (23Crane J.M.

Cells were then rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then blocked again and incubated for 30 min with 0.4 μg/ml polyclonal, C-terminal specific rabbit anti-AQP4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were then incubated for 30 min with 4 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) in blocking buffer. Red and green fluorescence was imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000S inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY), and binding affinities were determined by nonlinear regression of background-subtracted green/red fluorescence intensity ratios. Cells cultured as described above were incubated with 50 μg/ml rAb-58 for 60 min at 23 and 37 °C. Cells were then washed extensively with cold PBS supplemented with 6 mm glucose and 1.1 mg/ml sodium pyruvate and blocked for 20 min in 1% BSA at 4 °C. As described (29Ratelade J. Bennett J.L. Verkman A.S. Evidence against cellular internalization in vivo of NMO-IgG, aquaporin-4, and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 in neuromyelitis optica.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 45156-45164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), remaining AQP4 at the cell surface was labeled with 50 μg/ml rAb-58 at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with goat anti-human IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 555 (1:200, Invitrogen). The plasma membrane was stained using a fluorescent lectin, wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400, Invitrogen). Cells were then washed and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and surface AQP4 was quantified as the (background-subtracted) ratio of red (surface AQP4) to green (plasma membrane) fluorescence. In some experiments, cells were exposed to 250 μg/ml NMO-IgGs purified from three different NMO sera for 60 min at 23 and 37 °C. Before labeling of surface AQP4 with rAb-58, bound purified IgGs at the cell surface were removed by acid wash in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 15 s. TIRFM was done on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000E microscope with a through-objective TIRF attachment and a 100× TIRF oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.49) mounted on a perfect focus module (Nikon), as described (23Crane J.M. Lam C. Rossi A. Gupta T. Bennett J.L. Verkman A.S. Binding affinity and specificity of neuromyelitis optica autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 M1/M23 isoforms and orthogonal arrays.J. Biol.

Alexa Fluor 555-labeled AQP4 was excited using an argon ion laser through a Z514/10× excitation filter and imaged at 605 nm using a QuantEM 512SC deep-cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). CHO-K1 and U87MG cells were plated onto 96-well microplates (Costar, Corning) at 30,000 and 20,000 cells/well, respectively, and grown at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 18–24 h. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (BSS) (without phenol red) and incubated at 23 or 37 °C for 60 min with NMO-IgG or NMO-rAb in Hanks' BSS containing 2% pooled normal human complement serum (Innovative Research, Novi, MI) in a final volume of 50 μl. To measure LDH release, the microplate was cooled to room temperature for 10 min, and 50 μl of CytoTox-ONE homogeneous membrane integrity assay solution (Promega, Madison, WI) was added according to the manufacturer's protocol. Complete (100%) LDH release was measured by the addition of 0.5 μl of 1% Triton X-100 to lyse cells. Background (0% lysis) LDH release was measured in cells incubated with complement but no NMO-IgG or NMO-rAb. LDH concentration was assayed from resorufin fluorescence measured on a TECAN Infinite M1000 plate reader (TECAN Groups Ltd., Mannedorf, Switzerland) (excitation/emission 560/590 nm). For live/dead cell staining, cells were washed with Hanks' BSS and then incubated with 1 μm calcein-AM (live cells, green fluorescence) and 2 μm ethidium homodimer-1 (dead cells, red fluorescence) (Invitrogen) in PBS for 15 min prior to imaging. CHO-K1 cells were plated onto 96-well microplates (Costar, Corning) at 20,000 cells/well and grown at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 18–24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 120 min at 37 °C with rAb-53 or rAb-58 (10 and 100 μg/ml), or control-rAb 2B4, and effector NK cells (effector:target ratio 30:1). Cells were washed gently with PBS to remove the remaining NK cells. 1 μm calcein-AM and 2 μm ethidium homodimer-1 were added for 30 min to stain live cells green and dead cells red. CHO-K1 cells were plated onto coverslips in 24-well plates and grown at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 18–24 h. For C1q immunofluorescence, cells were washed with Hanks' BSS and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 400 μl of Hanks' BSS containing 40 μg/ml rAb-58 and 120 μg/ml human C1q protein (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 1% BSA for 30 min and incubated for 60 min with 1:200 dilution of FITC-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-C1q antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and 0.4 μg/ml polyclonal, C-terminal specific rabbit anti-AQP4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were incubated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) in 1% BSA. For C9neo immunofluorescence, cells were incubated with rAbs as above, together with 2% pooled normal human complement serum. After fixation and permeabilization, cells were incubated for 60 min with 0.1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-C5b-9 (C9neo) antibody and 0.4 μg/ml polyclonal, C-terminal specific rabbit anti-AQP4 antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were then incubated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml donkey anti-mouse IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) in 1% BSA. Cells were lysed in Blue Native buffer (500 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 12 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 45 min. Samples (10 μg protein) were mixed with 5% Coomassie Blue G-250 and gels were run and blotted with rabbit anti-AQP4 antibody as described (24Rossi A. Baumgart F. van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. Post-Golgi supramolecular assembly of aquaporin-4 in orthogonal arrays.Traffic. 2012; 13: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Experiments were done on two different AQP4-transfected cell types to ensure robustness of the conclusions: CHO-K1 cells and U87MG cells (a human astrocyte-derived line). Fig. 1A shows plasma membrane targeting of the M1 and M23 isoforms of AQP4 in stably transfected CHO-K1 and U87MG cells as seen by confocal fluorescence microscopy (top) and TIRFM (bottom). AQP4 immunofluorescence was absent in nontransfected cells (not shown). M1-AQP4, which does not form OAPs, showed a smooth pattern of fluorescence, whereas M23-AQP4, which assembles in OAPs at the plasma membrane, showed a characteristic punctate pattern of fluorescence. SDS-PAGE confirmed that the transfected cells expressed exclusively M1-AQP4 or M23-AQP4 (Fig. 1B, top), as expected. Native, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Blue Native-PAGE) showed a single band for M1-AQP4, indicating individual tetramers, whereas multiple high order bands were seen for M23-AQP4 because of its membrane clustering in OAPs (Fig. 1B, bottom). Fig. 1C shows cell surface expression of M1- and M23-AQP4. NMO antibody rAb-58, which binds to both M1-AQP4 and M23-AQP4 with similar affinity (23Crane J.M. Lam C. Rossi A. Gupta T. Bennett J.L.

There was slightly greater cell surface expression (by ∼20%) of M23- as compared with M1-AQP4 in both cell lines. An LDH fluorescence release assay was developed to quantify CDC. Fig. 2A shows fluorescence in the extracellular solution following cell incubation for 60 min at 37 °C with recombinant monoclonal NMO antibodies (rAb-53 or rAb-58) at 20 μg/ml and 2% human complement. Control studies (buffer alone, rAb or complement alone) showed low background signal. Incubation of M23-AQP4-expressing cells with NMO-rAbs and complement increased the LDH release fluorescence signal as compared with controls (Fig. 2A, left), whereas LDH release by M1-AQP4 cells was not increased (Fig. 2A, right), demonstrating resistance of M1-AQP4-expressing cells to CDC mediated by NMO-rAb. Antibody rAb-53 binds to M23-AQP4 with >10-fold greater affinity than to M1-AQP4, whereas rAb-58 binds to both isoforms with similar affinity (23Crane J.M. Lam C. Rossi A. Gupta T. Bennett J.L. Verkman A.S. Binding affinity and specificity of neuromyelitis optica autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 M1/M23 isoforms and orthogonal arrays.J. Biol.

Fig. 2B summarizes cytotoxicity (percentage of LDH release referenced to 100% measured with Triton X-100) as a function of antibody concentration. LDH release was seen in cells expressing M23-AQP4 following incubation with complement and NMO antibody, but not in cells expressing M1-AQP4 at 37 and 23 °C (a temperature where AQP4 endocytosis does not occur, see below). Cytotoxicity was measured in AQP4-expressing CHO-K1 and U87MG cells as a function of complement concentration (Fig. 2C, left) and incubation time (Fig. 2C, right). Although greater complement concentration or longer incubation time produced greater cytotoxicity in both M23-AQP4-expressing cell types, little cytotoxicity was seen in the M1-AQP4-expressing cells. Fig. 2D shows CDC using a different cytotoxicity assay involving live/dead cell staining. At high antibody concentration, many dead (red fluorescent) cells were seen in antibody-treated cells expressing M23-AQP4, but not in cells expressing M1-AQP4. The resistance of M1-AQP4-expressing cells to NMO-rAb mediated CDC could be due to differences in: (i) NMO-rAb binding to M1- versus M23-AQP4; (ii) internalization of M1- versus M23-AQP4 upon NMO-rAb binding, which would protect cells against CDC; and/or (iii) complement activation by antibody bound to AQP4. NMO antibody binding to cell surface AQP4 under the conditions of our experiment was determined using a quantitative immunofluorescence assay in which NMO antibody is labeled green (using anti-human secondary antibody) and AQP4 is labeled red (using rabbit anti-AQP4 antibody). Fig. 3A shows representative fluorescence micrographs (top) and deduced binding curves (bottom) for binding of rAb-53 and rAb-58 to M1- and M23-AQP4-expressing CHO-K1 cells. NMO rAb-53 binding was greater to M23- versus M1-AQP4 (KD 44 nm versus 2.6 μm), whereas rAb-58 binding was more similar (83 versus 202 nm). Importantly, under the conditions of the CDC measurements, at high antibody concentration, similar amounts of rAb-58 were bound to the M1- and M23-AQP4-expressing cells. Therefore, the resistance of M1-AQP4 to CDC cannot be explained by reduced NMO antibody binding alone. To determine whether NMO antibody binding causes differential internalization of M1- versus M23-AQP4 under the condition used for CDC, we measured cell surface AQP4 after incubation with 50 μg/ml NMO rAb-58 for 1 h at both 23 °C and 37 °C, using our quantitative cell surface expression assay (29Ratelade J. Bennett J.L. Verkman A.S. Evidence against cellular internalization in vivo of NMO-IgG, aquaporin-4, and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 in neuromyelitis optica.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 45156-45164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows that at 37 °C, ∼30 and 60% reduced cell surface AQP4 was seen for M1- and M23-AQP4 following incubation with rAb-58. Similar results were found in U87MG cells at 37 °C. However, cell surface AQP4 was minimally changed for both M1-AQP4 and M23-AQP4 at 23 °C in both cell lines (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the resistance of M1-AQP4-expressing cells to CDC is not due to reduced M1-AQP4 at the cell surface following NMO-rAb binding. Similar experiments were done with IgG isolated from NMO patient sera, which consists of a polyclonal mixture of NMO-IgGs comprising up to ∼1% of total IgGs. Fig. 4A shows LDH release by M1- and M23-AQP4-expressing cells as a function of IgG concentration. As found for the recombinant NMO antibodies, concentration-dependent cytotoxicity was seen in cells expressing M23-AQP4 that were incubated with complement and IgG isolated from serum of three different NMO patients. Cytotoxicity was absent in cells expressing M1-AQP4. Live/dead cell staining showed ind"
https://openalex.org/W2051406572,"Accurate information about the diet of large carnivores that are elusive and inhabit inaccessible terrain, is required to properly design conservation strategies. Predation on livestock and retaliatory killing of predators have become serious issues throughout the range of the snow leopard. Several feeding ecology studies of snow leopards have been conducted using classical approaches. These techniques have inherent limitations in their ability to properly identify both snow leopard feces and prey taxa. To examine the frequency of livestock prey and nearly-threatened argali in the diet of the snow leopard, we employed the recently developed DNA-based diet approach to study a snow leopard population located in the Tost Mountains, South Gobi, Mongolia. After DNA was extracted from the feces, a region of ∼100 bp long from mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene was amplified, making use of universal primers for vertebrates and a blocking oligonucleotide specific to snow leopard DNA. The amplicons were then sequenced using a next-generation sequencing platform. We observed a total of five different prey items from 81 fecal samples. Siberian ibex predominated the diet (in 70.4% of the feces), followed by domestic goat (17.3%) and argali sheep (8.6%). The major part of the diet was comprised of large ungulates (in 98.8% of the feces) including wild ungulates (79%) and domestic livestock (19.7%). The findings of the present study will help to understand the feeding ecology of the snow leopard, as well as to address the conservation and management issues pertaining to this wild cat."

The outermost epicuticular layer or waxy layer of the insect represents a structure rich in lipids including abundant amounts of hydrocarbons and fatty acids. A member of a novel cytochrome P450 subfamily, CYP52X1, implicated in fatty acid assimilation by B. bassiana was characterized. B. bassiana targeted gene knockouts lacking Bbcyp52x1 displayed reduced virulence when topically applied to Galleria mellonella, but no reduction in virulence was noted when the insect cuticle was bypassed using an intrahemoceol injection assay. No significant growth defects were noted in the mutant as compared with the wild-type parent on any lipids substrates tested including alkanes and fatty acids. Insect epicuticle germination assays, however, showed reduced germination of ΔBbcyp52x1 conidia on grasshopper wings as compared with the wild-type parent. Complementation of the gene-knock with the full-length gene restored virulence and insect epicuticle germination to wild-type levels. Heterologous expression of CYP52X1 in yeast was used to characterize the substrate specificity of the enzyme. CYP52X1 displayed the highest activity against midrange fatty acids (C12:0 and C14:0) and epoxy stearic acid, 4-8-fold lower activity against C16:0, C18:1, and C18:2, and little to no activity against C9:0 and C18:0. Analyses of the products of the C12:0 and C18:1 reactions confirmed NADPH-dependent regioselective addition of a terminal hydroxyl to the substrates (ω-hydroxylase). These data implicate CYP52X1 as contributing to the penetration of the host cuticle via facilitating the assimilation of insect epicuticle lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2065815434,"The L-galactose (Smirnoff-Wheeler) pathway represents the major route to L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) biosynthesis in higher plants. Arabidopsis thaliana VTC2 and its paralogue VTC5 function as GDP-L-galactose phosphorylases converting GDP-L-galactose to L-galactose-1-P, thus catalyzing the first committed step in the biosynthesis of L-ascorbate. Here we report that the L-galactose pathway of ascorbate biosynthesis described in higher plants is conserved in green algae. The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome encodes all the enzymes required for vitamin C biosynthesis via the L-galactose pathway. We have characterized recombinant C. reinhardtii VTC2 as an active GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase. C. reinhardtii cells exposed to oxidative stress show increased VTC2 mRNA and L-ascorbate levels. Genes encoding enzymatic components of the ascorbate-glutathione system (e.g. ascorbate peroxidase, manganese superoxide dismutase, and dehydroascorbate reductase) are also up-regulated in response to increased oxidative stress. These results indicate that C. reinhardtii VTC2, like its plant homologs, is a highly regulated enzyme in ascorbate biosynthesis in green algae and that, together with the ascorbate recycling system, the L-galactose pathway represents the major route for providing protective levels of ascorbate in oxidatively stressed algal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061277940,"Climate warming may lead to changes in the trophic structure and diversity of shallow lakes as a combined effect of increased temperature and salinity and likely increased strength of trophic interactions. We investigated the potential effects of temperature, salinity and fish on the plant-associated macroinvertebrate community by introducing artificial plants in eight comparable shallow brackish lakes located in two climatic regions of contrasting temperature: cold-temperate and Mediterranean. In both regions, lakes covered a salinity gradient from freshwater to oligohaline waters. We undertook day and night-time sampling of macroinvertebrates associated with the artificial plants and fish and free-swimming macroinvertebrate predators within artificial plants and in pelagic areas. Our results showed marked differences in the trophic structure between cold and warm shallow lakes. Plant-associated macroinvertebrates and free-swimming macroinvertebrate predators were more abundant and the communities richer in species in the cold compared to the warm climate, most probably as a result of differences in fish predation pressure. Submerged plants in warm brackish lakes did not seem to counteract the effect of fish predation on macroinvertebrates to the same extent as in temperate freshwater lakes, since small fish were abundant and tended to aggregate within the macrophytes. The richness and abundance of most plant-associated macroinvertebrate taxa decreased with salinity. Despite the lower densities of plant-associated macroinvertebrates in the Mediterranean lakes, periphyton biomass was lower than in cold temperate systems, a fact that was mainly attributed to grazing and disturbance by fish. Our results suggest that, if the current process of warming entails higher chances of shallow lakes becoming warmer and more saline, climatic change may result in a decrease in macroinvertebrate species richness and abundance in shallow lakes."

Here, the smallest example of a quinol dehydrogenase in nature, CymA, has been studied. CymA is a monotopic membrane tetraheme c-type cytochrome belonging to the NapC/NirT family and central to anaerobic respiration in Shewanella sp. Using protein-film electrochemistry, it is shown that vesicle-bound menaquinone-7 is not only a substrate for this enzyme but is also required as a cofactor when converting other quinones. Here, we propose that the high concentration of quinones in the membrane negates the evolutionary pressure to create a high affinity active site. However, the instability and reactivity of reaction intermediate, semiquinone, might require a cofactor that functions to minimize damaging side reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2048440639,"Agars are abundant polysaccharides from marine red algae, and their chemical structure consists of alternating d-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose residues, the latter of which are presumed to make the polymer recalcitrant to degradation by most terrestrial bacteria. Here we study a family 117 glycoside hydrolase (BpGH117) encoded within a recently discovered locus from the human gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. Consistent with this locus being involved in agarocolloid degradation, we show that BpGH117 is an exo-acting 3,6-anhydro-α-(1,3)-l-galactosidase that removes the 3,6-anhydrogalactose from the non-reducing end of neoagaro-oligosaccharides. A Michaelis complex of BpGH117 with neoagarobiose reveals the distortion of the constrained 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose into a conformation that favors catalysis. Furthermore, this complex, supported by analysis of site-directed mutants, provides evidence for an organization of the active site and positioning of the catalytic residues that are consistent with an inverting mechanism of catalysis and suggests that a histidine residue acts as the general acid. This latter feature differs from the vast majority of glycoside hydrolases, which use a carboxylic acid, highlighting the alternative strategies that enzymes may utilize in catalyzing the cleavage of glycosidic bonds.

Algae are the plants of the ocean; however, they produce oligo- and polysaccharides that are structurally and chemically distinct from those found on land. Although microbial degradation of these algal carbohydrates is of ecological importance and of increasing interest for biofuel applications (1Wargacki A.J. Leonard E. Win M.N. Regitsky D.D. Santos C.N. Kim P.B. Cooper S.R. Raisner R.M. Herman A. Sivitz A.B. Lakshmanaswamy A. Kashiyama Y. Baker D. Yoshikuni Y. An engineered microbial platform for direct biofuel production from brown macroalgae.Science. 2012; 335: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), how bacteria depolymerize and metabolize algal carbohydrates remains unclear in many cases. Like the cell walls of terrestrial plants, the cell wall and storage polysaccharides of marine macroalgae comprise a massive sink of biomass and photosynthetically fixed carbon (2Smith S.V. Marine macrophytes as a global carbon sink.Science. 1981; 211: 838-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Unlike the cell walls of terrestrial plants, however, the cell walls of macroalgae either lack lignin or are much less lignified. Furthermore, their matrix polysaccharides form flexible gels instead of crystalline polysaccharides like those of terrestrial plants, and this confers important properties to macroalgae (3Martone P.T. Estevez J.M. Lu F. Ruel K. Denny M.W. Somerville C. Ralph J. Discovery of lignin in seaweed reveals convergent evolution of cell-wall architecture.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 169-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). First, it permits dehydration and rehydration of the seaweed cell wall and thereby protects against desiccation occurring in the intertidal zone. Second, it enables the macroalgae to remain flexible enough to withstand the physical challenge imposed by this particular environment (e.g. waves and tides). Agars are the dominant gel-forming cell wall matrix polysaccharide (70%) in red seaweeds (agarophytes) and comprise a class of heterogeneous polymers having various degrees of sulfation and other substitutions including O-methylation. One of the major constituents of the cell wall of agarophytes, however, is the neutral and linear polysaccharide termed agarose (4Michel G. Nyval-Collen P. Barbeyron T. Czjzek M. Helbert W.

Enzymic synthesis of 3:6-anhydro-l-galactose within porphyran from l-galactose 6-sulphate units.Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 347-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Agarose is made of neoagarobiose motifs in which 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose is α-1,3-linked to d-galactose; the resulting disaccharide is linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds to form the linear polymer (see Fig. 1A). Agarose forms a helical structure stabilized by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds to generate a high gel strength polymer. The 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose, which is a bridged bicyclic system containing fused five- and six-membered rings, is critical for helix formation. Polysaccharides that lack this modification, like porphyran, which is a sulfated agarocolloid related to agarose, form viscous solutions instead of flexible gels (6Correc G. Hehemann J.H. Czjzek M. Helbert W. Structural analysis of the degradation products of porphyrin digested by Z. galactanivorans β-porphyranase Carbohydr.Polym. 2011; 83: 277-283Google Scholar). The high gel strength of agarose and its resistance to degradation by many microbes have supported its wide utilization in microbiological, molecular biological, and food applications (7Hitchens A.P. Leikind M.C. The introduction of agar-agar into bacteriology.J. Bacteriol. 1939; 37: 485-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, marine bacteria have evolved systems of metabolic enzymes to enable utilization of this abundant marine polymer as both a carbon and energy source (4Michel G. Nyval-Collen P. Barbeyron T. Czjzek M. Helbert W. Bioconversion of red seaweed galactans: a focus on bacterial agarases and carrageenases.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 71: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These metabolic pathways are initiated by specific carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) 4The abbreviations used are: CAZymescarbohydrate-active enzymesGHglycoside hydrolaseBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolG residued-galactose standardLA residue3,6-anhydro-l-galactose.

The largest class of carbohydrate-degrading CAZymes are the glycoside hydrolases, which hydrolyze glycosidic bonds found within high molecular weight carbohydrates to produce mono-, di-, and short oligosaccharides. These enzymes are ubiquitous throughout all domains of life. Currently, 130 families of GHs are classified in the CAZy database (Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database) (8Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4194) Google Scholar). Enzymes within one family are related by amino acid sequence and thus share common protein folds and catalytic mechanisms (8Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4194) Google Scholar). In general, glycoside hydrolases catalyze hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond using either a two-step double displacement mechanism resulting in retention of stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon or a one-step, single displacement mechanism that leads to a product with inverted stereochemistry at the anomeric center (9Davies G. Henrissat B. Structures and mechanisms of glycosyl hydrolases.Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). The highly polymerized nature of agarose, the presence of both α- and β-bonds in its backbone, and its composition of two different monosaccharide units create a challenge for its degradation by CAZymes. As such, both endo-acting (cleaving internally in the backbone) and exo-acting (acting only on the chain ends) CAZymes that cleave the β-1,4-glycosidic bond of agarose (Fig. 1A) have been described; these belong to glycoside hydrolase families 16, 50, 86, and 118. CAZymes that cleave the α-1,3-glycosidic bond presently belong to families 96 and 117. β-Agarases are relatively well studied, and much mechanistic and structural insight into the cleavage of the β-bond in agarose has been gained (4Michel G.

Family GH96 comprises a unique but very small family of endo-α-agarases. In contrast, family GH117 is substantially larger and more widely distributed in nature, suggesting a more general role of this enzyme family in agarose metabolism. Members of this family are known to cleave the α-1,3-glycosidic bond in neoagarose oligosaccharides to release 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose. This family was created based on the identification of the neoagarobiose hydrolase from Saccharophagus degradans (13Lee S. Lee J.Y. Ha S.C. Jung J. Shin D.H. Kim K.H. Choi I.G. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of neoagarobiose hydrolase from Saccharophagus degradans 2-40.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst.

Microbiol. 2011; 13: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Proteins belonging to GH117 are the only known enzymes that release monosaccharides from agaro-oligosaccharides; thus, they are of critical importance for polysaccharide utilization in agarolytic bacteria. Most GH117 enzymes are found in bacteria associated with seaweed, coral, and the intestines of fish, which is consistent with the abundance of agarose in the marine environment, but surprisingly these enzymes are also found, albeit with lower frequency, in bacteria from soil, the oral cavity, and the human intestine (14Rebuffet E.

Biol. 2002; 9: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In particular, conservation of active site residues has led to the postulation that the GH117 enzymes share an inverting catalytic mechanism with the GH43 enzymes (14Rebuffet E. Groisillier A. Thompson A. Jeudy A. Barbeyron T. Czjzek M. Michel G. Discovery and structural characterization of a novel glycosidase family of marine origin.Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 13: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Significant alterations in the active sites of the two enzyme families, however, have kept predictions about the general mechanism of catalysis and the identity of the catalytic residues in GH117 speculative. Here we present a structural and mutational analysis of the GH117 enzyme from Bacteroides plebeius called BpGH117. The x-ray crystallographic analysis of an inactive mutant of the enzyme in complex with unhydrolyzed substrate reveals the complex suite of residues involved in recognizing substrate and hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond and provides strong support for the proposed inverting hydrolytic mechanism. This analysis reveals distortion of the constrained 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose residue to a conformation conducive to hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond. In the proposed inverting catalytic mechanism, a histidine residue is suggested to act as the general acid, which would be the first observation of its kind for a glycoside hydrolase and would add to the recent example of a histidine acting as the acid/base catalytic residue for the retaining catalytic mechanism used by the N-acetylglucosaminidase from Bacillus subtilis (17Litzinger S.

The DNA that served as template for the PCR was extracted from B. plebeius obtained from DMSZ GmbH. The PCR product was cloned into pET-28 using standard directional cloning procedures using the restriction enzymes NheI and XhoI. The sequence was verified by bidirectional sequencing. The encoded protein, referred to as BpGH117, contained an N-terminal 6-histidine tag separated from the domain of interest by a thrombin cleavage site. This cloned gene construct was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene catalogue number 200518).

Plasmids were transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Star cells (Invitrogen). For protein expression, 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 mg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with a single bacterial colony and incubated at 30 °C for 8 h. One milliliter was used to inoculate 1 liter of autoinduction medium (19Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar), and the cultures were incubated with shaking for 5 days at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of sucrose solution (25% w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Ten milligrams of lysozyme was added to the suspension, and stirring was continued for 10 min. 50 ml of a deoxycholate solution containing 1% deoxycholate (w/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl was added with continued stirring for 10 min. The solution was adjusted to 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mg of DNase was added. Cellular debris was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied onto a 2-ml Ni2+-charged nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare), which was equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 0 to 500 mm in binding buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After dialysis, the proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Bio-Rad UNO Q6 column. Proteins were eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl; protein-containing fractions were concentrated in a stirred cell ultrafiltration unit using a 5-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Following concentration, a final polishing step of size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Sephacryl 16/60 Hiprep S-200 column using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The proteins were concentrated in a stirred ultrafiltration unit prior to crystallization and activity measurements. Selenomethionine-containing protein was produced in E. coli B834(DE3) cells in minimal autoinduction medium that lacked yeast extract and tryptone and was supplemented with selenomethionine (40 mg/liter) and the SelenoMet Nutrient Mix (5.1 g/liter), both from Athena Enzyme Systems. Crystallization experiments were performed at 18 °C by the vapor diffusion method using both hanging drops and sitting drops. Crystals of BpGH117 and mutants were obtained in conditions comprising polyethylene glycol 3350 at 15–25% (w/v) with 100 mm ammonium acetate (Sigma), 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.5 (Sigma). Prior to crystallization, mother liquor and protein solution were mixed and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g and 4 °C to remove precipitated protein; crystallization experiments were set up with the supernatant. The selenomethionine derivative of BpGH117 was crystallized in 15% PEG 3350 with 100 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.5 by streak seeding with microseeds of native crystals. A complex with neoagarobiose was obtained by co-crystallizing BpGH117E303Q (at 10 mg/ml) with 2 mm neoagarobiose in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m ammonium acetate, 17–21% PEG 3350. The crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in crystallization solution supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol or glycerol. The crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and data collection was carried out on either BL9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratories (Stanford, CA) or the CMCF1 beam line at the Canadian Light Source (Saskatoon, Canada). Data were processed using MOSFLM (20Battye T.G. Kontogiannis L. Johnson O. Powell H.R. Leslie A.G. iMOSFLM: a new graphical interface for diffraction-image processing with MOSFLM.Acta Crystallogr.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The structure of BpGH117 was solved by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method using an x-ray wavelength optimized for the selenium peak determined by a fluorescence scan (λ = 0.97911). SHELXC/D was used to determine the selenium substructure, which comprised 20 of the possible 22 total seleniums present in the two BpGH117 monomers in the asymmetric unit (23Sheldrick G.M. A short history of SHELX.Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81072) Google Scholar). Phasing was performed with SHARP, which resulted in figures of merit of 0.43 and 0.17 for acentric and centric reflections, respectively, and a phasing power of 1.5 over the full resolution range of the data set (24Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Automated structure solution with autoSHARP.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 364: 215-230PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry operators were determined using PROFESS followed by phase improvement by solvent flattening (with an estimated solvent content of 44%) and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging using DM (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). These phases were sufficient for automatic model building of a nearly complete model using ARP/wARP (25Langer G. Cohen S.X. Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Automated macromolecular model building for x-ray crystallography using ARP/wARP version 7.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). This model was corrected and completed by refinement with REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Skubák P. Lebedev A.A. Pannu N.S.

Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The completed model was used as a starting point to solve the structures of the neoagarobiose complex and mutant proteins. In all cases, water molecules were added using Coot Find Waters and inspected visually prior to deposition. Five percent of the observations were flagged as “free” and used to monitor refinement procedures (28Brünger A.T. Free R value: a novel statistical quantity for assessing the accuracy of crystal structures.Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Detection of enzyme activity by TLC was performed as described previously (30Duckworth M. Yaphe W. Thin layer chromatography analysis of enzymic hydrolysates of agar.J. Chromatogr. A. 1970; 49: 482-487Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The activity of the BpGH117 mutants was compared with that of the native protein by a time course digestion assay with an enzyme concentration of 0.5 μm and neoagarobiose at a concentration of 0.5% (1.54 mm) in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0. Aliquots were taken from each reaction at 5-min intervals and added to an equal volume of 0.1 m NaOH to stop the reaction. The samples were subsequently diluted into sterile distilled water to a final sugar concentration of 20 mm. The reactant and product sugars were then separated by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection using a Dionex ICS 3000 HPLC equipped with an ASI 100 automated sample injector and an ED50 electrochemical detector (Dionex) with a gold working electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Products were analyzed using a CarboPac PA-20 column set (analytical plus guard column). The running buffer comprised 0.1 m NaOH, and elution of the sugars was achieved using a linear gradient of 0–300 mm sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH. Homologues of BpGH117 were extracted from GenBankTM through Phylogeny.fr (31Dereeper A. Guignon V. Blanc G. Audic S. Buffet S. Chevenet F. Dufayard J.F. Guindon S. Lefort V. Lescot M. Claverie J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2001479656,"Irradiation and DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents are commonly used in anticancer treatments. Following DNA damage FOXM1 protein levels are often elevated. In this study, we sought to investigate the potential role of FOXM1 in programmed cell death induced by DNA-damage. Human cancer cells after FOXM1 suppression were subjected to doxorubicin or γ-irradiation treatment. Our findings indicate that FOXM1 downregulation by stable or transient knockdown using RNAi or by treatment with proteasome inhibitors that target FOXM1 strongly sensitized human cancer cells of different origin to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis. We showed that FOXM1 suppresses the activation of pro-apoptotic JNK and positively regulates anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, suggesting that JNK activation and Bcl-2 down-regulation could mediate sensitivity to DNA-damaging agent-induced apoptosis after targeting FOXM1. Since FOXM1 is widely expressed in human cancers, our data further support the fact that it is a valid target for combinatorial anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2059008558,"In this paper, we evaluate the uniqueness of several information-theoretic measures for graphs based on so-called information functionals and compare the results with other information indices and non-information-theoretic measures such as the well-known Balaban J index. We show that, by employing an information functional based on degree-degree associations, the resulting information index outperforms the Balaban J index tremendously. These results have been obtained by using nearly 12 million exhaustively generated, non-isomorphic and unweighted graphs. Also, we obtain deeper insights on these and other topological descriptors when exploring their uniqueness by using exhaustively generated sets of alkane trees representing connected and acyclic graphs in which the degree of a vertex is at most four."
https://openalex.org/W2023616226,"In Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementias, the microtubule-associated protein Tau forms intracellular paired helical filaments. The filaments can form not only by the full-length human Tau protein, but also by the three repeated (K19) or four repeated (K18) Tau segments. However, of interest, experimentally, K19 can seed K18, but not vice versa. To obtain insight into the cross-seeding between K18 and K19 aggregates, here, K18 and K19 octamers with repeat 3 (R3) in U-shaped, L-shaped, and long straight line-shaped (SL-shape) conformations are assembled into different structures. The simulation results show that K18-8/K19-8 (K18 and K19 assemblies number 8) with R3 in an L shape and K18-9/K19-9 with R3 in an SL shape are highly populated and present the highest structural similarity among all simulated K18 and K19 octamers, suggesting that similar folding of K18/K19 may serve as structural core for the K18-K19 co-assembled heterogeneous filament. We demonstrate that formation of stable R2 and R3 conformations is the critical step for K18 aggregation, and R3 is critical for K19 fibrillization. The different core units in K18 and K19 may create a cross-seeding barrier for the K18 seed to trigger K19 fibril growth because R2 is not available for K19. Our study provides insights into cross-seeding involving heterogeneous structures. The polymorphic nature of protein aggregation could be magnified in the cross-seeding process. If the seeding conformations lead to too much divergence in the energy landscape, it could impede fibril formation. Such an effect could also contribute to the asymmetric barrier between K18 and K19."
https://openalex.org/W2071050144,"Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. ap) is the causative agent of paratuberculosis or Johne's disease (JD) in herbivores with potential involvement in cases of Crohn's disease in humans. JD is spread worldwide and is economically important for both beef and dairy industries. Generally, pathogenic ovine strains (M. ap-S) are mainly found in sheep while bovine strains (M. ap-C) infect other ruminants (e.g. cattle, goat, deer), as well as sheep. In an effort to characterize this emerging infection in dromedary/Arabian camels, we successfully cultured M. ap from several samples collected from infected camels suffering from chronic, intermittent diarrhea suggestive of JD. Gene-based typing of isolates indicated that all isolates belong to sheep lineage of strains of M. ap (M. ap-S), suggesting a putative transmission from infected sheep herds. Screening sheep and goat herds associated with camels identified the circulation of this type in sheep but not goats. The current genome-wide analysis recognizes these camel isolates as a sub-lineage of the sheep strain with a significant number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between sheep and camel isolates (∼1000 SNPs). Such polymorphism could represent geographical differences among isolates or host adaptation of M. ap during camel infection. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to examine the genomic basis of this emerging infection in camels with implications on the evolution of this important pathogen. The sequenced genomes of M. ap isolates from camels will further assist our efforts to understand JD pathogenesis and the dynamic of disease transmission across animal species."
https://openalex.org/W1996439376,"Reelin (RELN), which is a glycoprotein secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells of the developing cerebral cortex, plays an important role in neuronal migration, but its role in cell migration and cancer metastasis is largely unclear. Here, we showed that cell motility was significantly increased in KYSE-510 cells by TGF-β1 treatment. Moreover, TGF-β1 decreased RELN mRNA expression and overexpression of Reelin at least partly reversed TGF-β1-induced cell migration in KYSE-30 cells. Furthermore, this negative regulation of Reelin expression by TGF-β1 was through Snail, one transcription factor which was induced by TGF-β1 in KYSE-510 cells. RELN promoter activity was reduced in parallel with the induction of Snail after TGF-β1 treatment and Snail suppressed both RELN promoter activity and expression through binding to E-box sequences in the RELN promoter region in ESCC cells. Knockdown of RELN induced cell migration in KYSE-510 cells, together with the increase of mesenchymal markers expression. Taken together, Reelin is an essential negative regulator in the TGF-β1-induced cell migration process, and is suppressed by TGF-β pathway at the transcriptional level through Snail regulation. Therefore, the correlation of Reelin and TGF-β pathway was critical in cancer metastasis, and Reelin could be one potential anti-metastasis target in future clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W1998772259,"This study investigated the impact of chronic exposure to continuous (CoP4) versus cyclic progesterone (CyP4) alone or in combination with 17β-estradiol (E2) on gene expression profiles targeting bioenergetics, metabolism and inflammation in the adult female rat hippocampus. High-throughput qRT-PCR analyses revealed that ovarian hormonal depletion induced by ovariectomy (OVX) led to multiple significant gene expression alterations, which were to a great extent reversed by co-administration of E2 and CyP4. In contrast, co-administration of E2 and CoP4 induced a pattern highly resembling OVX. Bioinformatics analyses further revealed clear disparities in functional profiles associated with E2+CoP4 and E2+CyP4. Genes involved in mitochondrial energy (ATP synthase α subunit; Atp5a1), redox homeostasis (peroxiredoxin 5; Prdx5), insulin signaling (insulin-like growth factor I; Igf1), and cholesterol trafficking (liver X receptor α subtype; Nr1h3), differed in direction of regulation by E2+CoP4 (down-regulation relative to OVX) and E2+CyP4 (up-regulation relative to OVX). In contrast, genes involved in amyloid metabolism (β-secretase; Bace1) differed only in degree of regulation, as both E2+CoP4 and E2+CyP4 induced down-regulation at different efficacy. E2+CyP4-induced changes could be associated with regulation of progesterone receptor membrane component 1(Pgrmc1). In summary, results from this study provide evidence at the molecular level that differing regimens of hormone therapy (HT) can induce disparate gene expression profiles in brain. From a translational perspective, confirmation of these results in a model of natural menopause, would imply that the common regimen of continuous combined HT may have adverse consequences whereas a cyclic combined regimen, which is more physiological, could be an effective strategy to maintain neurological health and function throughout menopausal aging."
https://openalex.org/W2148929213,"In general, point-of-care (POC) tests for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) show disappointing test performance, especially disappointing sensitivity results. However, one study sponsored by the manufacturer (Diagnostics for the Real World) reported over 80% sensitivity with their Chlamydia Rapid Test (CRT). We evaluated the performance of this CRT in a non-manufacturer-sponsored trial.Between July 2009 and February 2010, we included samples from 912 women in both high- and low-risk clinics for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Paramaribo, Suriname. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for CRT compared to NAAT (Aptima, Gen-Probe) were determined. Quantitative Ct load and human cell load were determined in all CRT and/or NAAT positive samples.CRT compared to NAAT showed a sensitivity and specificity of 41.2% (95% CI, 31.9%-50.9%) and 96.4% (95% CI, 95.0%-97.5%), respectively. PPV and NPV were 59.2% (95% CI, 47.5%-70.1%) and 92.9% (95% CI, 91.0%-94.5%), respectively. Quantitative Ct bacterial load was 73 times higher in NAAT-positive/CRT-positive samples compared to NAAT-positive/CRT-negative samples (p<0.001). Human cell load did not differ between true-positive and false-negative CRT results (p = 0.835). Sensitivity of CRT in samples with low Ct load was 12.5% (95% CI, 5.2%-24.2%) and in samples with high Ct load 73.5% (95% CI, 59.9%-84.4%).The sensitivity of CRT for detecting urogenital Ct in this non-manufacturer-sponsored study did not meet the expectations as described previously. The CRT missed samples with a low Ct load. Improved POC are needed as meaningful diagnostic to reduce the disease burden of Ct."
https://openalex.org/W2020715178,"Modulation of levels of polysialic acid (polySia), a sialic acid polymer, predominantly associated with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), influences neural functions, including synaptic plasticity, neurite growth, and cell migration. Biosynthesis of polySia depends on two polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV in vertebrate. However, the enzyme involved in degradation of polySia in its physiological turnover remains uncertain. In the present study, we identified and characterized a murine sialidase NEU4 that catalytically degrades polySia. Murine NEU4, dominantly expressed in the brain, was found to efficiently hydrolyze oligoSia and polySia chains as substrates in sialidase in vitro assays, and also NCAM-Fc chimera as well as endogenous NCAM in tissue homogenates of postnatal mouse brain as assessed by immunoblotting with anti-polySia antibodies. Degradation of polySia by NEU4 was also evident in neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells that were co-transfected with Neu4 and ST8SiaIV genes. Furthermore, in mouse embryonic hippocampal primary neurons, the endogenously expressed NEU4 was found to decrease during the neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, GFP- or FLAG-tagged NEU4 was partially co-localized with polySia in neurites and significantly suppressed their outgrowth, whereas silencing of NEU4 showed the acceleration together with an increase in polySia expression. These results suggest that NEU4 is involved in regulation of neuronal function by polySia degradation in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2041362556,"ATP-gated ionotropic P2X4 receptors are up-regulated in activated microglia and are critical for the development of neuropathic pain, a microglia-associated disorder. However, the nature of how plasma membrane P2X4 receptors are regulated in microglia is not fully understood. We used single-molecule imaging to track quantum dot-labeled P2X4 receptors to explore P2X4 receptor mobility in the processes of resting and activated microglia. We find that plasma membrane P2X4 receptor lateral mobility in resting microglial processes is largely random, consisting of mobile and slowly mobile receptors. Moreover, lateral mobility is P2X subunit- and cell-specific, increased in an ATP activation and calcium-dependent manner, and enhanced in activated microglia by the p38 MAPK pathway that selectively regulates slowly mobile receptors. Thus, our data indicate that P2X4 receptors are dynamically regulated mobile ATP sensors, sampling more of the plasma membrane in response to ATP and during the activated state of microglia that is associated with nervous system dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2038185750,"Genomic imprinting is an important epigenetic phenomenon, which on the phenotypic level can be detected by the difference between the two heterozygote classes of a gene. Imprinted genes are important in both the development of the placenta and the embryo, and we hypothesized that imprinted genes might be involved in female fertility traits. We therefore performed an association study for imprinted genes related to female fertility traits in two commercial pig populations. For this purpose, 309 SNPs in fifteen evolutionary conserved imprinted regions were genotyped on 689 and 1050 pigs from the two pig populations. A single SNP association study was used to detect additive, dominant and imprinting effects related to four reproduction traits; total number of piglets born, the number of piglets born alive, the total weight of the piglets born and the total weight of the piglets born alive. Several SNPs showed significant () additive and dominant effects and one SNP showed a significant imprinting effect. The SNP with a significant imprinting effect is closely linked to DIO3, a gene involved in thyroid metabolism. The imprinting effect of this SNP explained approximately 1.6% of the phenotypic variance, which corresponded to approximately 15.5% of the additive genetic variance. In the other population, the imprinting effect of this QTL was not significant (), but had a similar effect as in the first population. The results of this study indicate a possible association between the imprinted gene DIO3 and female fertility traits in pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2039195585,"Ras-like (Ral) small GTPases are regulated downstream of Ras and the noncanonical Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RalGEF) effector pathway. Despite RalA and RalB sharing 82% sequence identity and utilization of shared effector proteins, their roles in normal and neoplastic cell growth have been shown to be highly distinct. Here, we determined that RalB function is regulated by protein kinase Cα (PKCα) phosphorylation. We found that RalB phosphorylation on Ser-198 in the C-terminal membrane targeting sequence resulted in enhanced RalB endomembrane accumulation and decreased RalB association with its effector, the exocyst component Sec5. Additionally, RalB phosphorylation regulated vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion by regulating v- and t-SNARE interactions. RalB phosphorylation regulated vesicular traffic of α5-integrin to the cell surface and cell attachment to fibronectin. In summary, our data suggest that phosphorylation by PKCα is critical for RalB-mediated vesicle trafficking and exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2010261445,"In recent years, the preservation of biodiversity has become an important issue. Despite much public discussion, however, current practices in the food industry seldom take account of its potential economic importance: on the contrary, the introduction of industrialized agriculture practices over large areas has often resulted in a dramatic reduction in biodiversity. In this paper, we report on the remarkable degree of biodiversity in the wine yeast populations naturally present in a small area of Sicily (Italy) where traditional (non-industrial) winery practices are still in place. Out of more than 900 Saccharomyces yeast isolates recovered from late spontaneous fermentations, we detected at least 209 strains. Most interestingly, when evaluated at the fermentation and technological level, a number of isolates were found to be superior to industrial yeast strains. Out of a selected group, isolates from two strains were used for experimental fermentations in a winery environment and the quality of the wines produced was assessed at the technological, quality and sensory levels. Given that the characteristics of the wines produced were found to be industrially appealing, the study demonstrated the economic potential of preserving the patrimony of Sicilian yeast biodiversity and highlighted the importance of maintaining traditional wine making practices."

They are defined by the expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5). Here, we identified a critical role for the DEAD-box helicase antigen (HAGE) in ABCB5+ MMIC-dependent tumorigenesis and show that HAGE-specific inactivation inhibits melanoma tumor growth mediated by this tumor-initiating population. Knockdown of HAGE led to a significant decrease in RAS protein expression with a concomitant decrease in activation of the AKT and ERK signaling pathways implicated to play an important role in melanoma progression. To confirm that the reduction in NRAS (Neuroblastoma RAS) expression was dependent on the HAGE helicase activity, we showed that NRAS, effectively silenced by siRNA, could be rescued by reintroduction of HAGE in cells lacking HAGE. Furthermore, we provide a mechanism by which HAGE promotes NRAS unwinding in vitro. We also observed using tumor transplantation in Non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice that the HAGE knockdown in a ABCB5+ melanoma cell line displayed a significant decrease in tumor growth and compared with the control. Our results suggest that the helicase HAGE is required for ABCB5+ MMIC-dependent tumor growth through promoting RAS protein expression and that cancer therapies targeting HAGE helicase may have broad applications for treating malignant melanoma and potentially other cancer types.

The helicase antigen (HAGE), a non-X-linked cancer testis (CT) antigen of 648 amino acids (73 kDa) was originally identified in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (1Martelange V. De Smet C. De Plaen E. Lurquin C. Boon T. Identification on a human sarcoma of two new genes with tumor-specific expression.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3848-3855PubMed Google Scholar). HAGE, also known as DDX43 or CT13, belongs to the DEAD-box family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases characterized by the presence of nine conserved motifs grouped into two domains connected by a polylinker SAT region (2Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Helicase structure and mechanism.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The Q motif, motifs I, II (also called the D-E-A-D-box as a single-letter code for Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp), and III, together with motif IV, bind and hydrolyze ATP molecules. The remaining motifs (V, VI, Ia, and Ib) are thought to interact with the RNA substrate. It has been suggested that RNA helicases browse RNA molecules in a bidirectional fashion using the energy gained from ATP hydrolysis until they encounter ribonucleoprotein-RNA complexes (3Silverman E. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Lin R.J. DExD/H-box proteins and their partners. Helping RNA helicases unwind.Gene. 2003; 312: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The helicase activity then allows the dissociation of RNA from the ribonucleoprotein to which they have high affinity (4Fuller-Pace F.V. DExD/H box RNA helicases. Multifunctional proteins with important roles in transcriptional regulation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).

This population of cells express the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5), a protein that renders malignant melanoma drug-resistant and refractory to therapy. As a consequence, this population is thought to be responsible for a highly aggressive type of cancer with a poor prognosis and outcome (15Frank N.Y. Schatton T. Kim S. Zhan Q. Wilson B.J. Ma J.

Although the mechanisms by which ABCB5+ MMIC resist systemic therapy have been well studied, their role in promoting tumor growth and progression is still under investigation. Here, we reveal a previously unknown role of the helicase HAGE in ABCB5+ MMIC-dependent tumor growth and progression. Using a stem cell proliferation assay, we show that HAGE is required for tumor growth initiated by this population of cells. HAGE knockdown in a melanoma cell line expressing ABCB5 caused a decrease of RAS protein expression, subsequently leading to a significant decrease in the activation of its downstream effectors, AKT and ERK. Silencing of NRAS in the HAGE knockdown melanoma cell line using NRAS-specific siRNA was rescued successfully after reintroduction of HAGE in these cells. We took this further and provide a mechanistic insight by demonstrating the capacity of the helicase HAGE to unwind NRAS RNA complexes using an in vitro unwinding assay. Finally, tumor transplantation assays clearly demonstrated the in vivo role of HAGE in promoting ABCB5+ MMIC-dependent tumor progression. Collectively, these findings clearly implicate the helicase HAGE in the promotion of tumor growth in melanoma through RAS/AKT and RAS/ERK pathways and shed new light on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ABCB5+ MMIC-dependent tumorigenesis. malignant melanoma-initiating cell ATP-binding cassette ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5 immunoblotting immunofluorescence helicase antigen neuroblastoma RAS phosphorylated AKT proliferating cell nuclear antigen Forkhead box O. The human melanoma cell lines FM82 and FM55 were a kind gift from Professor D. Schadendorff of the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (Heidelberg, Germany). All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% (w/v) l-glutamine (Lonza) and incubated at 37 °C supplied with a 5% CO2 humid environment. A stable knockdown cell line was created using shRNA-bearing plasmids specific for HAGE (SureSilencing shRNA Plasmid for Human DDX43, SABiosciences). FM82 and FM55 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well into a 24-well plate and grown overnight. 1.2 μg of SureSilencing shRNA was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. 48 h later, the cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and grown in media treated with 500 μg/ml G418 antibiotic to allow selection of plasmid-transfected cells. HAGE expression status was monitored using real-time quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The transient knockdown of NRAS was carried out using an NRAS-specific siRNA molecule (Eurogentec) (sense, 5′-CAGCAGUGAUGAUGGGACUTT-3′ and antisense, 5′-AGUCCCAUCAUCACUGCUGTT-3′) and Interferin transfection reagent (Polyplus) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. To investigate if the introduction of HAGE into cells results in increased NRAS protein expression, FM82 stable transfectants were firstly cultured and then transfected with NRAS siRNA as described above. 24 h following transfection, a second transfection was carried out using a HAGE-specific cDNA vector, pcDNA3.1-HAGE, to ectopically express HAGE. Transfection was performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol and 12 μg of the vector to transfect a T25 flask as described by the manufacturer. At 48 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested for protein extraction. FM82 and FM55 control and FM82 and FM55 shRNAs cells were grown to 80% confluence as described above. Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNA-STAT 60 reagent (AMS Biotechnology) as described by the manufacturer. Extracted RNAs were quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Muloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), oligo(dT) primers (Promega), and 2 μg of total RNA were subsequently used for cDNA synthesis following the protocol of the manufacturer. Real-time quantitative PCR was then carried out using primers (all MWG Eurofins) specific for HAGE (forward, 5′-GGAGATCGGCCATTGATAGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGATTGGGGATAGGTCGTTT-3′), NRAS (forward, 5′-AAACCTCAGCCAAGACCAGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCCTGAGTCCCATCATCACT-3′) and the housekeeping genes TBP1 (forward, 5′-TGCACAGGAGCCAAGAGTGAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CACATCACAGCTCCCCACCA-3′) and HPRT1 (forward, 5′-TGACACTGGCAAAACAATGCA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT-3′) using a Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR cycler (Qiagen). Forty cycles were performed, and melt curves were ratified following each analysis. Expression of the genes of interest was normalized using averaged results for the housekeeping genes, and 2ΔCT calculations were performed. For this study, we used a monoclonal HAGE antibody (1:250 for immunoblotting (IB), 1:50 immunofluorescence (IF), SAB1400618, Sigma), ABCB5 (1:500 for IB, 1:100 for IF, HPA026975, Sigma), β-actin (1:1000, 4967, Cell Signaling Technologies), AKT (1:250 for IB, 9272, Cell Signaling Technologies), p-AKT (Ser-473) (1:250 for IB, 4058, Cell Signaling Technologies), GSK3β (1:250 for IB, 9315, Cell Signaling Technologies), p-GSK3β (Ser-9) (1:250 for IB, 9336, Cell Signaling Technologies), NRAS (1:100 for IB, 1:50 for IF, SC-31, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Kirsten RAS (1:100 for IB, SC-30, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Harvey RAS (1:100 for IB, SC-29, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21CIP1 (1:250 for IB, ab80633, Abcam), c-SRC (cellular-SRC) (1:250 for IB, SC-5266, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GRB2 (1:250 for IB, 3972, Cell Signaling Technologies), SOS1 (1:250 for IB, SC-55528, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK1/2 (1:250 for IB, 4695, Cell Signaling Technologies), p-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (1:250 for IB, 9101, Cell Signaling Technologies), p-FOXO1 (Thr-24)/FOXO3a (Thr-32)/FOXO4 (Thr-28) (1:250 for IB, 2599, Cell Signaling Technology), and PCNA (1:100 for IF, ab29, Abcam). HRP-conjugated antibodies were used as secondary antibodies for IB (1:500, Dako). Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated antibodies were used as secondary antibodies for IF (1:500, Invitrogen). Paraffin-embedded human melanoma tissue microarrays were purchased from US Biomax. The sections were dewaxed, rehydrated in graded alcohols, rinsed in double distilled H2O, and then antigen retrieval was performed for 10 min (0.01 m citrate phosphate buffer (pH 6.0)) in a microwave at 1000 Watt. The tumors excised from non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice were embedded in OCT (optimal cutting temperature) media, fixed in 2-butanol (Sigma) that had been super-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned using a cryostat CM1900 (Leica). Melanoma cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and then treated as follows. The sections or cancer cells were washed three times in 1× PBS for 10 min each, blocked and permeabilized in 10% (w/v) BSA in 0.1% (v/v) PBS-Tween, incubated overnight with primary antibody (in blocking solution), washed three times for 10 min each with 1× PBS, incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody (in blocking solution), and washed three times with 1× PBS. Sections and melanoma cells were counterstained and mounted with DAPI fluorescent medium (Vector Laboratories) for IF microscopy. For IB, cancer cells were collected, washed with 1× PBS, lysed in 1× solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol and loaded on Tris/glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were separated alongside a molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad). Protein bands were transferred onto Amersham Biosciences Hybond-P PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with 10% Marvel milk/TBS solution with 0.05% Tween 20 containing sodium orthovanadate and sodium fluoride. Following TBS solution with 0.05% Tween 20 washes, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (in blocking solution) at 4 °C overnight followed by washing and incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature ahead of visualization with Rapid Step ECL reagent (Calbiochem) and viewed using a charge coupled device camera (Fujifilm). For immuno-dot-blot analysis of signaling phosphoproteins, Proteome Profiler arrays (R&D Systems) specific for the PI3K and MAPK pathways were acquired and used in accordance with the guidelines of the manufacturer using protein lysates extracted from FM82 control and FM82 shRNA1 cells. Blots were visualized in the same manner as described above, and densitometry readings of each dot were carried out using densitometry software (Aida v. 5.2). All cells were grown in 24-well plates (Sarstedt) at 5 × 104 cells/well. All necessary treatments were performed in duplicate. Assessment of the effect of HAGE knockdown on cell proliferation was performed on day 1 and day 3 following plating (n = three independent experiments). The day prior to testing, cells were treated with complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 3H and allowed to absorb the isotope during overnight incubation. On the day of testing, medium was removed, and cells were lysed with ddH20, leading to the release of incorporated 3H. The contents of the plate were subsequently harvested onto a Unifilter 96-well plate using a Filtermate Harvester (Packard), which was allowed to dry using a drying cabinet (SLS). Each test well was treated with 40 μl of Microscint-O media (PerkinElmer). Plate reading was carried out using a Top-Count NXT microplate scintillation counter (Packard). Non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice were acquired (Harlan Laboratories, UK) and kept in accordance with UK Home Office regulations. Mice were kept in individual ventilated cages supplied with laminar air flow and autoclaved food and water taken ad libitum. Mice were separated into two groups and injected subcutaneously into the right flank with 1 × 106 FM82 control or FM82 shRNA cells per 100 μl of serum-free medium. Tumor development was observed twice weekly using caliper measurements. Once one of the tumors reached a diameter of 1 cm, the experiment was stopped, and mice were euthanized prior to tumors being extracted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled 2-butanol (Sigma), and stored at −80 °C. For the culture of melanospheres, cells from FM82 and FM55 controls and FM82 and FM55 shRNAs were plated at clonal density (10 × 103 cells/ml in 24-well plates) in a DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen, 32500) supplemented with N-2 Max Media (R&D Systems, AR009), and daily addition of fibroblast growth factor basic 100 ng/ml and EGF 100 ng/ml (both from Sigma) for a 10-day culture period (17Na Y.R.

The differentiation of melanospheres was induced upon FGF basic and EGF withdrawal. The cells were stained by immunofluorescence as described above. The plasmid pDNR-LIB containing NRAS was purchased from Open Biosystems and used for in vitro transcription using the T7 promoter to generate the NRAS transcript (Ambion). NRAS transcripts were labeled using the Pierce RNA 3′ end biotinylation kit (Thermo Scientific). The labeling efficiency was determined by dot blotting following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The biotinylated transcripts (100 pmol) were transfected in 6-well plates containing FM82 control and FM82 shRNA cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transcripts were detected by immunofluorescence using Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen). Biotinylated RNA (2 pmol, labeling efficiency higher than 75%, 5′-GACUCAGGGUUGUAUGGGAUUGCCAUGUGUGGUGAUGUAA-3′) was placed to wind with unlabeled NRAS RNA in a solution containing 3.5 mm equimolar of ATP/MgCl2 for 5 min at 95 °C followed by 1 h at 37 °C. HAGE recombinant protein was added at two different concentrations (0.6 μg and 1.2 μg) after the RNA winding assay, followed by 1 h of incubation at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 50% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.025% (w/v) bromophenol blue. Samples were analyzed on 12% (w/v) native acrylamide gels in 1× Tris/Borate/EDTA buffer followed by blot transfer and visualization using the chemiluminescent detection module (Thermo Scientific). A number of studies have demonstrated that ATP-dependent RNA helicases belonging to the family of DEAD-box proteins could be involved in the process of tumorigenesis (9Amler L.C. Schürmann J.

Because the role of HAGE in tumor growth has yet to be described, we wanted to determine its role in melanoma growth. We examined HAGE expression in tumor tissue microarrays containing malignant melanoma patient samples by performing immunostaining using a HAGE-specific polyclonal antibody. As a control, we tested normal skin. HAGE expression was observed in 6 of 10 melanoma samples (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). At the cellular level, HAGE was demonstrated to be cytoplasmic, with few cells exhibiting a nucleocytoplasmic localization. HAGE expression was confined to cytoplasmic aggregates in the FM82 and FM55 melanoma cell lines (FM82 control and FM55 control) as detected by immunofluorescence, which was markedly decreased when HAGE was stably knocked down using shRNAs (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 2, A and C). To determine the effect of HAGE expression on cell proliferation, we performed a thymidine incorporation assay to measure the proliferation rate of FM82 and FM55 shRNAs cells compared with FM82 and FM55 control cells. A significant reduction in proliferation was observed in the FM82 and FM55 shRNA cell lines after days 1 and 3 (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2HAGE silencing results in a decrease of proliferation in vitro and in vivo.

FM82 control and FM82 shRNA1 were injected subcutaneously into two groups of immunodeficient mice (non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency). Mice injected with FM82 shRNA1 cells developed tumors at a significantly slower rate compared with the FM82 control group (Fig. 2D). The tumors that developed in FM82 control- and FM82 shRNA1-injected mice were excised and histologically prepared for analysis by immunofluorescence using antibodies against HAGE and the proliferation marker PCNA. HAGE and PCNA protein expression was significantly reduced in FM82 shRNA tumors compared with FM82 control tumors (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HAGE promotes proliferation and tumor growth of malignant melanoma cells. To determine whether HAGE is involved in tumor growth via regulation of downstream kinases involved in promoting cell proliferation, FM82 control and FM82 shRNA1 cell lysates were diluted and incubated with nitrocellulose membranes spotted with phospho-kinase antibodies. Densitometry analysis of the different spots revealed a significant decrease of intensity of phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK spots when incubated with FM82 shRNA1 cell lysates compared with controls (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunoblotting using phospho-AKT (Ser-473) and phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies confirmed that both p-AKT and p-ERK levels were significantly decreased in FM82 and FM55 shRNAs cells lacking HAGE (Fig. 3, C and E, and supplemental Fig. 2C). This result suggests that HAGE promotes predominantly AKT and ERK phosphorylation. The total level of AKT protein appeared to increase following HAGE silencing, whereas ERK1/2 total protein levels were slightly decreased in FM82 shRNAs, suggesting that HAGE may play a role in ERK1/2 protein expression (Fig. 3, C and E). Phosphorylated AKT and ERK promote proliferation and survival by inducing the phosphorylation of FOXO transcription factors and GSK3β, thereby inactivating their function in regulating apoptosis and proliferation (20Manoukian A.S.

The emergence of whole-genome sequences provides us an opportunity to identify the entire CR gene repertoires. To completely gain more insight into the evolution of CR genes in vertebrates, we identified the nearly all CR genes in 25 vertebrates using homology-based approaches. Among these CR gene repertoires, nearly half of them were identified for the first time in those previously uncharacterized species, such as the guinea pig, giant panda and elephant, etc. Consistent with previous findings, we found that the numbers of CR genes vary extensively among different species, suggesting an extreme form of 'birth-and-death' evolution. For the purpose of facilitating CR gene analysis, we constructed a database with the goals to provide a resource for CR genes annotation and a web tool for exploring their evolutionary patterns. Besides a search engine for the gene extraction from a specific chromosome region, an easy-to-use phylogenetic analysis tool was also provided to facilitate online phylogeny study of CR genes. Our work can provide a rigorous platform for further study on the evolution of CR genes in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2052700012,"Efficient apoptotic cell engulfment is important for both tissue homeostasis and immune response in mammals. In the present study, we report that Beclin 1 (a regulator of autophagy) is required for apoptotic cell engulfment. The engulfment process was largely abolished in Beclin 1 knock-out cells, and Beclin 1 knockdown significantly decreased apoptotic cell internalization in macrophage and fibroblast cell lines. Beclin 1 was recruited to the early phagocytic cup along with the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and Rac1, which regulates actin dynamics in lamellipodia. No lamellipodia were formed in Beclin 1 knock-out cells, and Beclin 1 knockdown completely inhibited the promotion of engulfment by ectopic expression of Rac1. Beclin 1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Rac1. These data indicate that Beclin 1 coordinates actin dynamics and membrane phospholipid synthesis to promote efficient apoptotic cell engulfment."
https://openalex.org/W2099710963,"Eph kinases constitute the largest receptor tyrosine kinase family, and their ligands, ephrins (Efns), are also cell surface molecules. Although they are ligands, Efns can transduce signals reversely into cells. We have no prior knowledge of the role played by any members of this family of kinases or their ligands in blood pressure (BP) regulation. In the present studies, we investigated the role of Efnb1 in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contractility and BP regulation. We revealed that reverse signaling through Efnb1 led to a reduction of RhoA activation and VSMC contractility in vitro. Consistent with this finding, ex vivo, there was an increase of RhoA activity accompanied by augmented myosin light chain phosphorylation in mesenteric arteries from mice with smooth muscle-specific conditional Efnb1 gene knock-out (KO). Small interfering RNA knockdown of Grip1, a molecule associated with the Efnb1 intracellular tail, partially eliminated the effect of Efnb1 on VSMC contractility and myosin light chain phosphorylation. In support of these in vitro and ex vivo results, Efnb1 KO mice on a high salt diet showed a statistically significant heightened increment of BP at multiple time points during stress compared with wild type littermates. Our results demonstrate that Efnb1 is a previously unknown negative regulator of VSMC contractility and BP and that it exerts such effects via reverse signaling through Grip1."
https://openalex.org/W2163997162,"TGF-β (transforming growth factor β) plays a variety of cellular functions mainly through the Smad pathway. Phosphorylation of the carboxyl SXS motif in R-Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) by the type I receptor TβRI is a key step for their activation. It has been reported that the serine/threonine kinase PAK2 (p21-activated kinase 2) can mediate TGF-β signaling in mesenchymal cells. Here, we report that PAK2 restricts TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 activation and transcriptional responsiveness in MDCK epithelial cells. Mechanistically, PAK2 associates with Smad2 and Smad3 in a kinase activity-dependent manner and blocks their activation. PAK2 phosphorylates Smad2 at Ser-417, which is adjacent to the L3 loop that contributes to the TβRI-R-Smad association. Consistently, substitution of Ser-417 with glutamic acid attenuates the interaction of Smad2 with TβRI. Together, our results indicate that PAK2 negatively modulate TGF-β signaling by attenuating the receptor-Smad interaction and thus Smad activation."
https://openalex.org/W2000674607,"Objectives of this study were to evaluate glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal structural changes and proteinuria in aged Beagle dogs before and after hydrocortisone (HC) administration. Eleven Beagle dogs ≥10 years old were treated with either hydrocortisone (HC group, n = 6) or placebo (control group, n = 5). Urinary markers, GFR and kidney biopsies were evaluated before (T0), during (T16 wks) and after discontinuing HC administration (T24 wks). Results indicate that HC administration causes a significant increase in GFR. At all time points except T16 wks, proteinuria was higher in the control group than in the HC group, and there was no significant difference in urinary markers between groups. At T16 wks, proteinuria, urinary albumin-to-creatinine (c) ratio, immunoglobulin G/c and retinol-binding protein/c were higher compared to baseline in the HC group. At T0, rare to mild renal lesions were detected in all HC dogs and rare to moderate changes in all control dogs. Glomerulosclerosis progressed in both groups until T24 wks. Tubular atrophy was detected in three HC dogs at T16 wks and T24 wks, but also in five control dogs throughout the study. At every time point, five HC dogs and all control dogs had rare to moderate interstitial inflammation. Rare to mild interstitial fibrosis was found in up to three HC dogs at T16 wks and T24 wks, and severe fibrosis in one HC dog at T24 wks. Up to four control dogs had rare to mild fibrosis at all time points. These findings indicate that clinically healthy, aged Beagle dogs may have considerable renal lesions and proteinuria, which could have implications for experimental or toxicological studies. Additional research is needed to elucidate glucocorticoid effects on renal structure, but functional changes such as hyperfiltration and proteinuria warrant attention to kidney function of canine patients with Cushing's syndrome or receiving exogenous glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2066871041,"Extreme altitude can induce a range of cellular and systemic responses. Although it is known that hypoxia underlies the major changes and that the physiological responses include hemodynamic changes and erythropoiesis, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways mediating such changes are largely unknown. To obtain a more complete picture of the transcriptional regulatory landscape and networks involved in extreme altitude response, we followed four climbers on an expedition up Mount Xixiabangma (8,012 m), and collected blood samples at four stages during the climb for mRNA and miRNA expression assays. By analyzing dynamic changes of gene networks in response to extreme altitudes, we uncovered a highly modular network with 7 modules of various functions that changed in response to extreme altitudes. The erythrocyte differentiation module is the most prominently up-regulated, reflecting increased erythrocyte differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells, probably at the expense of differentiation into other cell lineages. These changes are accompanied by coordinated down-regulation of general translation. Network topology and flow analyses also uncovered regulators known to modulate hypoxia responses and erythrocyte development, as well as unknown regulators, such as the OCT4 gene, an important regulator in stem cells and assumed to only function in stem cells. We predicted computationally and validated experimentally that increased OCT4 expression at extreme altitude can directly elevate the expression of hemoglobin genes. Our approach established a new framework for analyzing the transcriptional regulatory network from a very limited number of samples."
https://openalex.org/W2082275874,"Activation of the forkhead box transcription factor FoxO is suggested to be involved in dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease (PD), in which a PD gene product LRRK2 activates FoxO through phosphorylation. In the current study that combines Drosophila genetics and biochemical analysis, we show that cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent kinase II (cGKII) also phosphorylates FoxO at the same residue as LRRK2, and Drosophila orthologues of cGKII and LRRK2, DG2/For and dLRRK, respectively, enhance the neurotoxic activity of FoxO in an additive manner. Biochemical assays using mammalian cGKII and FoxO1 reveal that cGKII enhances the transcriptional activity of FoxO1 through phosphorylation of the FoxO1 S319 site in the same manner as LRRK2. A Drosophila FoxO mutant resistant to phosphorylation by DG2 and dLRRK (dFoxO S259A corresponding to human FoxO1 S319A) suppressed the neurotoxicity and improved motor dysfunction caused by co-expression of FoxO and DG2. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) also increased FoxO's activity, whereas the administration of a NOS inhibitor L-NAME suppressed the loss of DA neurons in aged flies co-expressing FoxO and DG2. These results strongly suggest that the NO-FoxO axis contributes to DA neurodegeneration in LRRK2-linked PD."

https://openalex.org/W2045395394,"Myc plays an important role in tumor development, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, MYC is also a powerful inducer of apoptosis, which is one of the major failsafe programs to prevent cancer development. To clarify the relative importance of the extrinsic (death receptor-mediated) versus the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis in MYC-driven AML, we coexpressed MYC together with anti-apoptotic proteins of relevance for AML; BCL-X(L)/BCL-2 (inhibiting the intrinsic pathway) or FLIP(L) (inhibiting the extrinsic pathway), in hematopoietic stems cells (HSCs). Transplantation of HSCs expressing MYC into syngeneic recipient mice resulted in development of AML and T-cell lymphomas within 7-9 weeks as expected. Importantly, coexpression of MYC together with BCL-X(L)/BCL-2 resulted in strongly accelerated kinetics and favored tumor development towards aggressive AML. In contrast, coexpression of MYC and FLIP(L) did neither accelerate tumorigenesis nor change the ratio of AML versus T-cell lymphoma. However, a change in distribution of immature CD4(+)CD8(+) versus mature CD4(+) T-cell lymphoma was observed in MYC/FLIP(L) mice, possibly as a result of increased survival of the CD4+ population, but this did not significantly affect the outcome of the disease. In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that BCL-X(L) and BCL-2 but not FLIP(L) acts in synergy with MYC to drive AML development."

UGTs compete with P450 enzymes, which bioactivate HAAs by N-hydroxylation of the exocyclic amine group; the resultant N-hydroxy-HAA metabolites form covalent adducts with DNA. We have characterized the UGT-catalyzed metabolic products of AαC and the genotoxic metabolite 2-hydroxyamino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (HONH-AαC) formed with human liver microsomes, recombinant human UGT isoforms, and human hepatocytes. The structures of the metabolites were elucidated by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry. AαC and HONH-AαC underwent glucuronidation by UGTs to form, respectively, N2-(β-d-glucosidurony1)-2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AαC-N2-Gl) and N2-(β-d-glucosidurony1)-2-hydroxyamino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AαC-HON2-Gl).

The propensity of AαC and structurally related compounds in tobacco smoke to undergo bioactivation by enzymes expressed in liver and extrahepatic tissues provides a biochemical mechanism for the elevated risk of liver and digestive cancers in smokers (25Raza H.

We report a novel pathway of bioactivation of HONH-AαC where UGTs catalyze the formation an O-linked glucuronide conjugate, AαC-HN2-O-Gl, which binds covalently to DNA. Thus, UGT enzymes, normally viewed as a means of detoxication of many carcinogens, serves as a mechanism of bioactivation and likely transports of HON-AαC from liver to extrahepatic tissues.DISCUSSIONThe N-glucuronidation of HAAs, aromatic amines, and their genotoxic N-hydroxylated metabolites by UGTs is an important mechanism of detoxication of these structurally related chemicals. The UGT enzyme pathways compete with P450 and phase II enzyme pathways, which bioactivate these procarcinogens (Scheme 1) (17Turesky R.J. Le Marchand L.

The formation of AαC-HN2-O-Gl by human UGTs is the first example of the occurrence of an O-glucuronide conjugate from this group of structurally related carcinogens. AαC-HN2-O-Gl is a biologically reactive metabolite that binds to DNA (Fig. 7). Moreover, the binding of HONH-AαC to DNA is catalyzed by UGTs present in human liver microsomes (Fig. 8).The kinetic parameters of UGT enzymes were characterized to determine which isoforms catalyze this unique pathway of bioactivation of HONH-AαC. UGT1A9 is the most catalytically active isoform in O-glucuronidation of HONH-AαC (Table 2). UGT1A9 is also the principal UGT isoform involved in the O-linked glucuronidation of simple phenols (18Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Metabolism, expression, and disease.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) and a major isoform involved in the detoxication by N3-glucuronidation of HONH-PhIP, the genotoxic metabolite of the cooked meat carcinogen PhIP (21Nowell S.A.

Identification of specific UGT1A family isoforms involved.Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). UGT1A9 is present in human liver, colon, prostate, and breast among other tissues (16Nagar S. Remmel R.P. Uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase pharmacogenetics and cancer.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1659-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Given the low Km (0.9 μm) value of UGT1A9-mediated AαC-HN2-O-Gl formation, we may expect that UGT1A9 catalyzes the O-glucurionidation of HONH-AαC and its binding to DNA in vivo.O-Glucuronide conjugates of several arylhydroxamic acids are produced by UGT enzymes (20Irving C.C. Glucuronide formation in the metabolism of N-substituted aryl compounds.Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1981; 58: 109-111PubMed Google Scholar, 49Mulder G.J. Hinson J.A. Gillette J.R. Generation of reactive metabolites of N-hydroxy-phenacetin by glucoronidation and sulfation.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), including the O-glucuronide conjugate of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, which was identified in urine of rats treated with 2-acetylaminofluorene (50Cramer J.W. Miller J.A. Miller E.C. N-Hydroxylation. A new metabolic reaction observed in the rat with the carcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene.J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 885-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolite was stable in urine, but it was labile in vitro under slightly alkaline pH. The investigators proposed that the N-acetyl group of the AAF moiety had migrated to a hydroxyl group of the glucuronic acid (20Irving C.C. Glucuronide formation in the metabolism of N-substituted aryl compounds.Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1981; 58: 109-111PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting O-glucuronide of 2-hydroxyaminofluorene underwent reaction with nucleophiles (Scheme 2). This metabolite may have contributed to 2-acetylaminofluorene-DNA adduct formation in vivo (13Miller E.C. Some current perspectives on chemical carcinogenesis in humans and experimental animals. Presidential address.Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 1479-1496PubMed Google Scholar, 20Irving C.C. Glucuronide formation in the metabolism of N-substituted aryl compounds.Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1981; 58: 109-111PubMed Google Scholar). However, the O-glucuronide conjugate of 2-hydroxyaminofluorene or O-glucuronide conjugates of other arylhydroxylamines have not been detected in vivo probably because the conjugates are unstable in aqueous solution and decompose within several minutes (48Irving C.C. Fishman W.H. Metabolic Conjugation and Metabolic Hydrolysis. academic Press, Inc., New York1973: 53-119Google Scholar).SCHEME 2UGT-mediated bioactivation of the N-hydroxy metabolites of 2-acetylaminofluorene and AαC. Under slightly alkaline pH, the N-acetyl moiety of the O-glucuronide metabolite of HONH-AAF undergoes transacetylation to an hydroxyl group of the glucuronate. The resultant O-glucuronide conjugate, 2-AF-N2-O-Gl-Ac, is labile and reacts with DNA or protein (20Irving C.C. Glucuronide formation in the metabolism of N-substituted aryl compounds.Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1981; 58: 109-111PubMed Google Scholar). HONH-AαC undergoes direct O-glucuronidation, to form AαC-HN2-O-Gl, which forms covalent adducts with DNA and presumably proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The stability of the O-glucuronide linkage of AαC-HN2-O-Gl is considerably greater than that of the O-glucuronide conjugate of 2-hydroxyaminofluorene. The half-life of AαC-HN2-O-Gl exceeds 6 h at pH 7.0, but AαC-HN2-O-Gl undergoes a facile nucleophilic displacement reaction with dG to form the dG-C8-AαC adduct. Electrophiles of intermediate reactivity have been viewed as the most genotoxic species because highly reactive electrophiles will react with weaker nucleophiles or undergo solvolysis with water before they can react with DNA (51Lawley P.D. Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. Vol. 1. ACS Monographs 182, Washington, D. C.1984: 324-484Google Scholar). Thus, AαC-HN-O-Gl is an ideal genotoxic electrophile that can react with DNA.UGTs play several different roles in the metabolism of AαC that impact its biological activity. N2-Glucuronidation of AαC leads to the formation of a detoxicated product. However, HONH-AαC can undergo either N2- or O-glucuronidation. The enzyme kinetic studies with recombinant human UGT isoforms and metabolism studies with human hepatocytes reveal that AαC-HN-O-Gl is the predominant glucuronide conjugate of HONH-AαC formed under low substrate concentrations (Fig. 9 and supplemental Table 1S). Moreover, because of its long half-life, AαC-HN-O-Gl is likely to be exported from liver to extrahepatic tissues, where it can react with DNA (Scheme 2). The role of UGTs in the genotoxicity of AαC, as opposed to N-acetyltransferase and sulfotransferase enzymes that are normally associated with the bioactivation of HAAs (17Turesky R.J. Le Marchand L.

IntroductionEpidemiologic studies conducted over the past two decades have consistently shown that tobacco smoking is a risk factor for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (1Giovannucci E.

There is also mounting evidence that tobacco smoke is an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, the predominant form of human liver cancer (3Lee Y.C. Cohet C. Yang Y.C. Stayner L.

Apart from the endocyclic nitrogen atoms, AαC has the same chemical structure as 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), perhaps the most well studied among the carcinogenic aromatic amines (Fig. 1) (9Kriek E.

Thus, AαC may be a causal agent of liver and other digestive tract cancers in smokers.HAAs and structurally related arylamines undergo metabolic activation by N-hydroxylation of the exocyclic amine groups by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2052803786,"Many experimental approaches to the control of steering rely on the tangent point (TP) as major source of information. The TP is a good candidate to control self-motion. It corresponds to a singular and salient point in the subject's visual field, and its location depends on the road geometry, the direction of self-motion relative to the road and the position of the driver on the road. However, the particular status of the TP in the optical flow, as a local minimum of flow speed, has often been left aside. We therefore assume that the TP is actually an optimal location in the dynamic optical array to perceive a change in the trajectory curvature. In this study, we evaluated the ability of human observers to detect variations in their path curvature from optical flow patterns, as a function of their gaze direction in a virtual environment. We simulated curvilinear self-motion parallel to a ground plane. Using random-dot optic flow stimuli of brief duration and a two-alternative forced-choice adaptive procedure, we determined path curvature discrimination thresholds, as a function of gaze direction. The discrimination thresholds are minimal for a gaze directed toward a local minimum of optical flow speed. A model based on Weber fraction of the foveal velocities () correctly predicts the relationship between experimental thresholds and local flow velocities. This model was also tested for an optical flow computation integrating larger circular areas in central vision. Averaging the flow over five degrees leads to an even better fit of the model to experimental thresholds. We also found that the minimal optical flow speed direction corresponds to a maximal sensitivity of the visual system, as predicted by our model. The spontaneous gazing strategies observed during driving might thus correspond to an optimal selection of relevant information in the optical flow field."
https://openalex.org/W2049549368,"Historically, studies concerning bat flight have focused primarily on the wings. By analyzing high-speed video taken on 48 individuals of five species of vespertilionid bats, we show that the capacity to flap the tail-membrane (uropatagium) in order to generate thrust and lift during takeoffs and minimal-speed flight (<1 m (s-1)) was largely underestimated. Indeed, bats flapped the tail-membrane by extensive dorso-ventral fanning motions covering as much as 135 degrees of arc consistent with thrust generation by air displacement. The degree of dorsal extension of the tail-membrane, and thus the potential amount of thrust generated during platform launches, was significantly correlated with body mass (P = 0.02). Adduction of the hind limbs during upstrokes collapsed the tail-membrane thereby reducing its surface area and minimizing negative lift forces. Abduction of the hind limbs during the downstroke fully expanded the tail-membrane as it was swept ventrally. The flapping kinematics of the tail-membrane is thus consistent with expectations for an airfoil. Timing offsets between the wings and tail-membrane during downstrokes was as much as 50%, suggesting that the tail-membrane was providing thrust and perhaps lift when the wings were retracting through the upstoke phase of the wing-beat cycle. The extent to which the tail-membrane was used during takeoffs differed significantly among four vespertilionid species (P = 0.01) and aligned with predictions derived from bat ecomorphology. The extensive fanning motion of the tail membrane by vespertilionid bats has not been reported for other flying vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1965504189,"Genome size evolution is a complex process influenced by polyploidization, satellite DNA accumulation, and expansion of retroelements. How this process could be affected by different reproductive strategies is still poorly understood.We analyzed differences in the number and distribution of major repetitive DNA elements in two closely related species, Silene latifolia and S. vulgaris. Both species are diploid and possess the same chromosome number (2n = 24), but differ in their genome size and mode of reproduction. The dioecious S. latifolia (1C = 2.70 pg DNA) possesses sex chromosomes and its genome is 2.5× larger than that of the gynodioecious S. vulgaris (1C = 1.13 pg DNA), which does not possess sex chromosomes. We discovered that the genome of S. latifolia is larger mainly due to the expansion of Ogre retrotransposons. Surprisingly, the centromeric STAR-C and TR1 tandem repeats were found to be more abundant in S. vulgaris, the species with the smaller genome. We further examined the distribution of major repetitive sequences in related species in the Caryophyllaceae family. The results of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) on mitotic chromosomes with the Retand element indicate that large rearrangements occurred during the evolution of the Caryophyllaceae family.Our data demonstrate that the evolution of genome size in the genus Silene is accompanied by the expansion of different repetitive elements with specific patterns in the dioecious species possessing the sex chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1968024579,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is caused by the selective destruction of insulin-producing β-cells. This process is mediated by cells of the immune system through release of nitric oxide, free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induce a complex network of intracellular signalling cascades, eventually affecting the expression of genes involved in β-cell survival.The aim of our study was to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance to cytokine-induced β-cell death. To this purpose, we created a cytokine-resistant β-cell line (β-TC3R) by chronically treating the β-TC3 murine insulinoma cell line with IL-1β + IFN-γ. β-TC3R cells exhibited higher proliferation rate and resistance to cytokine-mediated cell death in comparison to the parental line. Interestingly, they maintained expression of β-cell specific markers, such as PDX1, NKX6.1, GLUT2 and insulin. The analysis of the secretory function showed that β-TC3R cells have impaired glucose-induced c-peptide release, which however was only moderately reduced after incubation with KCl and tolbutamide. Gene expression analysis showed that β-TC3R cells were characterized by downregulation of IL-1β and IFN-γ receptors and upregulation of SOCS3, the classical negative regulator of cytokines signaling. Comparative proteomic analysis showed specific upregulation of 35 proteins, mainly involved in cell death, stress response and folding. Among them, SUMO4, a negative feedback regulator in NF-kB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, resulted hyper-expressed. Silencing of SUMO4 was able to restore sensitivity to cytokine-induced cell death in β-TC3R cells, suggesting it may play a key role in acquired cytokine resistance by blocking JAK/STAT and NF-kB lethal signaling.In conclusion, our study represents the first extensive proteomic characterization of a murine cytokine-resistant β-cell line, which might represent a useful tool for studying the mechanisms involved in resistance to cytokine-mediated β-cell death. This knowledge may be of potential benefit for patients with T1DM. In particular, SUMO4 could be used as a therapeutical target."
https://openalex.org/W2035195820,"In vitro fertilisation (IVF) and related technologies are arguably the most challenging of all cell culture applications. The starting material is a single cell from which one aims to produce an embryo capable of establishing a pregnancy eventually leading to a live birth. Laboratory processing during IVF treatment requires open manipulations of gametes and embryos, which typically involves exposure to ambient conditions. To reduce the risk of cellular stress, we have developed a totally enclosed system of interlinked isolator-based workstations designed to maintain oocytes and embryos in a physiological environment throughout the IVF process. Comparison of clinical and laboratory data before and after the introduction of the new system revealed that significantly more embryos developed to the blastocyst stage in the enclosed isolator-based system compared with conventional open-fronted laminar flow hoods. Moreover, blastocysts produced in the isolator-based system contained significantly more cells and their development was accelerated. Consistent with this, the introduction of the enclosed system was accompanied by a significant increase in the clinical pregnancy rate and in the proportion of embryos implanting following transfer to the uterus. The data indicate that protection from ambient conditions promotes improved development of human embryos. Importantly, we found that it was entirely feasible to conduct all IVF-related procedures in the isolator-based workstations."

These studies were driven by knowledge of the erythroid-specific transcription factors or co-activator proteins that compose the essential transcriptional machinery and were designed to find out if EKLF interacted with these known molecules. Although this approach shed much light on the molecular mechanisms of EKLF function, it also limited the extent to which one could elucidate unexpected modes of EKLF function or regulation. Several lines of evidence hint at gaps in our knowledge of EKLF regulation and function. First, although EKLF has two nuclear localization signals and exhibits nuclear localization as expected for its function as a transcription factor (12Quadrini K.J. Bieker J.J.

EKLF/KLF1 is ubiquitinated in vivo, and its stability is regulated by activation domain sequences through the 26 S proteasome.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2285-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed that the stabilities of both nuclear and cytoplasmic EKLF could be regulated by the proteasome. To date, candidate proteins that regulate EKLF stability have not been reported in the literature. Third, various studies have ascribed paradoxical roles of EKLF in cell cycle regulation. EKLF activates transcription of E2f2, through which it regulates the entry of erythroid progenitors into the cell divisions that precede terminal erythroid differentiation (17Pilon A.M. Arcasoy M.O. Dressman H.K. Vayda S.E. Maksimova Y.D. Sangerman J.I. Gallagher P.G. Bodine D.M.

Chem. 2009; 284: 20966-20974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At the same time, EKLF has also been shown to be a transcriptional activator of cell cycle inhibitors like p18INK4c (19Tallack M.R. Keys J.R. Perkins A.C. Erythroid Kruppel-like factor regulates the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p18INK4c.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and p21WAF1/CIP1 (20Siatecka M. Lohmann F. Bao S. Bieker J.J. EKLF directly activates the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene by proximal promoter and novel intronic regulatory regions during erythroid differentiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2811-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Given the restricted tissue specificity and temporal regulation of EKLF expression in vivo, it is possible that post-translational regulation and/or protein interactions govern which of the opposing roles EKLF plays in the cell divisions that lead to terminal erythroid differentiation. In addition, EKLF is expressed over a period that encompasses several different stages in hematopoiesis (21Lohmann F. Bieker J.J.

Exposing primary human erythroid progenitor cells to RB7, a short chain fatty acid derivative, can induce EKLF binding to the CACCC site of the γ-globin promoter, concomitant with induction of γ-globin expression (6Perrine S.P. Mankidy R. Boosalis M.S. Bieker J.J. Faller D.V.

Haematol. 2009; 82: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As EKLF does not activate γ-globin transcription in definitive erythroid cells (2Pilon A.M. Ajay S.S. Kumar S.A. Steiner L.A.

Given the circumstantial evidence in the literature, most compellingly the cytoplasmic localization of EKLF, we hypothesized that EKLF might interact with, or be regulated by, proteins that are not typically part of the transcription machinery. To address this question, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged EKLF that was expressed in MEL cells and identified associated proteins using mass spectrometry. In this paper, we show that EKLF interacts with Ppm1b, a protein phosphatase that belongs to the PP2C family of protein phosphatases (23Shi Y. Serine/threonine phosphatases. Mechanism through structure.Cell. 2009; 139: 468-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar), and we describe its ability to modulate EKLF function by various means, including regulation of EKLF protein stability and transcriptional function. The zinc-inducible FLAG-EKLF MEL stable cell line (7Siatecka M. Xue L. Bieker J.J. Sumoylation of EKLF promotes transcriptional repression and is involved in inhibition of megakaryopoiesis.Mol. Cell.

Lysate, normalized to 42 mg of protein in 10 ml of lysis buffer, was precleared with rabbit IgG-agarose (Sigma) for 60 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 250 μl of M2-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C (24Woo A.J. Moran T.B. Schindler Y.L. Choe S.K. Langer N.B. Sullivan M.R. Fujiwara Y. Paw B.H.

The gel was stained with colloidal blue (Invitrogen) and destained in deionized water overnight. The protein bands were excised and analyzed by the mass spectrometry facility at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. Co-immunoprecipitations of exogenous EKLF and Ppm1b utilized protein lysate obtained from a 10-cm dish of transfected 293T cells.

Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Transfections were performed using DMRIE-C (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells derived from peripheral blood were obtained from All Cells. CD34+ cells were plated at a density of 0.4 × 106 cells/ml in expansion media consisting of serum-free expansion medium (SFEM; StemCell Technologies) that was supplemented with 2% penicillin/streptomycin, recombinant human thrombopoietin (50 ng/ml), SCF (25 ng/ml), and Flt-3 ligand (50 ng/ml) (27Wu M.H.

Bound complexes were eluted, resolved, and identified by mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1). We excluded common contaminants seen in mass spectrometric analysis from further consideration. We also eliminated from consideration proteins that could have interacted with FL-EKLF as a response to cell stress. The induction of exogenous EKLF expression by ZnCl2 has the potential to evoke the expression of proteins that respond to cell stress or proteins involved in the unfolded protein response, which could be induced in response to increased protein synthesis. For this reason, we excluded Scyl2 (also known as coated vesicle-associated kinase of 104 kDa, CVAK104) (31Düwel M. Ungewickell E.J.

We focused our study on Ppm1b, as 10 of the peptides, derived from three bands on the gel (supplemental Table 2) and providing the largest number of peptides in this dataset that corresponded with a single protein, were identified as derived from Ppm1b. Many studies show a significant functional overlap between Ppm1b and the closely related Ppm1a. To confirm that the peptides detected by mass spectrometric analysis derive from Ppm1b, rather than Ppm1a, we performed a ClustalW sequence alignment analysis. Although several of the identified peptides are in regions where Ppm1a and -1b were identical, most are located in regions where there are several amino acid differences between the two proteins (Fig. 1). One identified peptide is located in the C-terminal region of Ppm1b, which has no analogous region in Ppm1a. The sequence alignment shows that the identified protein is indeed Ppm1b. The fact that the peptides were identified from three differently migrating bands isolated from an SDS gel raised the possibility that EKLF may interact with more than one Ppm1b isoform. A ClustalW sequence alignment revealed that 9 of the 10 peptides identified by the mass spectrometric analysis reside in Ppm1b regions that do not differ between isoforms (supplemental Fig. S2). One of the peptide sequences only exists in Ppm1b isoform 1. This result suggests that EKLF may interact with multiple Ppm1b isoforms. Evidence for a potential role of Ppm1b in gene regulation is complex. Ppm1b has been shown to dephosphorylate Cdk9 at Thr-186, acting either as a negative regulator of pTEF-b function (33Wang Y. Dow E.C. Liang Y.Y. Ramakrishnan R. Liu H. Sung T.L. Lin X. Rice A.P. Phosphatase PPM1A regulates phosphorylation of Thr-186 in the Cdk9 T-loop.J. Biol.

To test this hypothesis, we used three different siRNAs to silence Ppm1b in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Fig. 2a), followed by differentiation of HSCs into erythroid progenitors (29Chen J. Peterson K.R. Iancu-Rubin C. Bieker J.J. Design of embedded chimeric peptide nucleic acids that efficiently enter and accurately reactivate gene expression in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As depletion of Ppm1b did not affect induction of EKLF transcription, it seems likely that Ppm1b is functioning downstream of EKLF to regulate β-globin transcription upon erythroid induction. To further characterize the role of Ppm1b in erythropoiesis, and elucidate its structural or functional interaction with EKLF, we identified the region in EKLF that interacts with Ppm1b by co-expression of exogenous Myc-tagged Ppm1b with FLAG-tagged EKLF, or EKLF mutants in 293T cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with M2-agarose (Sigma). We included PEST sequence deletion mutants in this set of experiments because they have been shown to play a role in regulating EKLF stability (16Quadrini K.J. Bieker J.J.

In the course of our studies, we noticed that EKLF levels increased when exogenous Ppm1b was co-expressed (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5–7 in Fig. 4a and compare lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 4b). Because expression of each EKLF variant is under the control of the same promoter within each experiment, it seemed unlikely that the increase in EKLF levels is due to changes in transcription levels. Ppm1b also increases the EKLF protein levels even in the absence of the EKLF PEST1 sequence that is important for mediating the EKLF interaction with Ppm1b (compare lanes 1 and 2 with"
https://openalex.org/W1965112396,"Background Glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) is a high-capacity/low-affinity urate transporter. To date, several recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and follow-up studies have identified genetic variants of SLC2A9 associated with urate concentrations and susceptibility to gout. We therefore investigated associations between gout and polymorphisms and haplotypes in the presumptive promoter region of GLUT9 in Chinese males. Methodology/Principal Findings The approximately 2000 bp presumptive promoter region upstream of the start site of exon 1 of GLUT9 was sequenced and subjected to genetic analysis. A genotype-phenotype correlation was performed and polymorphisms-induced changes in transcription factor binding sites were predicted. Of 21 SNPs identified in GLUT9, five had not been previously reported. Two of the SNPs (rs13124007 and rs6850166) were associated with susceptibility to gout (p = 0.009 and p = 0.042, respectively). The C allele of rs13124007 appeared to be the risk allele for predisposition to gout (p = 0.006, OR 1.709 [95% CI 1.162–2.514]). For rs6850166, an increased risk of gout was associated with the A allele (p = 0.029, OR 1.645 [95% CI 1.050–2.577]). After Bonferroni correction, there was statistically difference in rs13124007 allele frequencies between gout cases and controls (P = 0.042). Haplotype analyses showed that haplotype GG was a protective haplotype (p = 0.0053) and haplotype CA was associated with increased risk of gout (p = 0.0326). Genotype-phenotype analysis among gout patients revealed an association of rs13124007 with serum triglycerides levels (P = 0.001). The C to G substitution in polymorphism rs13124007 resulted in a loss of a binding site for transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1). Conclusions/Significance Polymorphisms rs13124007 and rs6850166 are associated with susceptibility to gout in Chinese males."
https://openalex.org/W1975555140,"The discovery of microRNAs has resulted in a major expansion of the number of molecules known to be involved in gene regulation. Elucidating the functions of animal microRNAs has posed a significant challenge as their target interactions with messenger RNAs do not adhere to simple rules. Of the thousands of known animal microRNAs, relatively few microRNA:messenger RNA regulatory interactions have been biologically validated in an normal organismal context. Here we present evidence that three microRNAs from the Hox complex in Drosophila (miR-10-5p, miR-10-3p, miR-iab-4-5p) do not have significant effects during embryogenesis on the expression of Hox genes that contain high confidence microRNAs target sites in the 3′ untranslated regions of their messenger RNAs. This is significant, in that it suggests that many predicted microRNA-target interactions may not be biologically relevant, or that the outcomes of these interactions may be so subtle that mutants may only show phenotypes in specific contexts, such as in environmental stress conditions, or in combinations with other microRNA mutations."

The present trial is the first to test the hypothesis that escitalopram may reduce neuroticism in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with major depressive disorder (MD).The trial used a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled parallel-group design. We examined the effect of four weeks escitalopram 10 mg daily versus matching placebo on personality in 80 people who had a biological parent or sibling with a history of MD. The outcome measure on personality traits was change in self-reported neuroticism scores on the Revised Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness-Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPQ) from entry until end of four weeks of intervention.When compared with placebo, escitalopram did not significantly affect self-reported NEO-PI-R and EPQ neuroticism and extroversion, EPQ psychoticism, NEO-PI-R openness, or NEO-PI-R conscientiousness (p all above 0.05). However, escitalopram increased NEO-PI-R agreeableness scores significantly compared with placebo (mean; SD) (2.38; 8.09) versus (-1.32; 7.94), p = 0.046), but not following correction for multiplicity. A trend was shown for increased conscientiousness (p = 0.07).

https://openalex.org/W1997692315,"The understanding of the effective functionality that governs the enzymatic self-organized processes in cellular conditions is a crucial topic in the post-genomic era. In recent studies, Transfer Entropy has been proposed as a rigorous, robust and self-consistent method for the causal quantification of the functional information flow among nonlinear processes. Here, in order to quantify the functional connectivity for the glycolytic enzymes in dissipative conditions we have analyzed different catalytic patterns using the technique of Transfer Entropy. The data were obtained by means of a yeast glycolytic model formed by three delay differential equations where the enzymatic rate equations of the irreversible stages have been explicitly considered. These enzymatic activity functions were previously modeled and tested experimentally by other different groups. The results show the emergence of a new kind of dynamical functional structure, characterized by changing connectivity flows and a metabolic invariant that constrains the activity of the irreversible enzymes. In addition to the classical topological structure characterized by the specific location of enzymes, substrates, products and feedback-regulatory metabolites, an effective functional structure emerges in the modeled glycolytic system, which is dynamical and characterized by notable variations of the functional interactions. The dynamical structure also exhibits a metabolic invariant which constrains the functional attributes of the enzymes. Finally, in accordance with the classical biochemical studies, our numerical analysis reveals in a quantitative manner that the enzyme phosphofructokinase is the key-core of the metabolic system, behaving for all conditions as the main source of the effective causal flows in yeast glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2076188874,"Various methods of reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks infer transcriptional regulatory interactions (TRIs) between strongly coexpressed gene pairs (as determined from microarray experiments measuring mRNA levels). Alternatively, however, the coexpression of two genes might imply that they are coregulated by one or more transcription factors (TFs), and do not necessarily share a direct regulatory interaction. We explore whether and under what circumstances gene pairs with a high degree of coexpression are more likely to indicate TRIs, coregulation or both. Here we use established TRIs in combination with microarray expression data from both Escherichia coli (a prokaryote) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a eukaryote) to assess the accuracy of predictions of coregulated gene pairs and TRIs from coexpressed gene pairs. We find that coexpressed gene pairs are more likely to indicate coregulation than TRIs for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the incidence of TRIs in highly coexpressed gene pairs is higher for Escherichia coli. The data processing inequality (DPI) has previously been applied for the inference of TRIs. We consider the case where a transcription factor gene is known to regulate two genes (one of which is a transcription factor gene) that are known not to regulate one another. According to the DPI, the non-interacting gene pairs should have the smallest mutual information among all pairs in the triplets. While this is sometimes the case for Escherichia coli, we find that it is almost always not the case for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This brings into question the usefulness of the DPI sometimes employed to infer TRIs from expression data. Finally, we observe that when a TF gene is known to regulate two other genes, it is rarely the case that one regulatory interaction is positively correlated and the other interaction is negatively correlated. Typically both are either positively or negatively correlated."

FI functions only in the presence of several cofactors, such as factor H, C4b-binding protein, complement receptor 1, and membrane cofactor protein. FI is composed of two chains linked by a disulfide bridge; the light chain comprises only the serine protease (SP) domain, whereas the heavy chain contains the FI membrane attack complex domain (FIMAC), CD5 domain, and low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LDLr1) and LDLr2 domains.

https://openalex.org/W2142809643,"Background For competing species to coexist, individuals must compete more with others of the same species than with those of other species. Ecologists search for tradeoffs in how species might partition the environment. The negative correlations among competing species that would be indicative of tradeoffs are rarely observed. A recent analysis showed that evidence for partitioning the environment is available when responses are disaggregated to the individual scale, in terms of the covariance structure of responses to environmental variation. That study did not relate that variation to the variables to which individuals were responding. To understand how this pattern of variation is related to niche variables, we analyzed responses to canopy gaps, long viewed as a key variable responsible for species coexistence. Methodology/Principal Findings A longitudinal intervention analysis of individual responses to experimental canopy gaps with 12 yr of pre-treatment and 8 yr post-treatment responses showed that species-level responses are positively correlated – species that grow fast on average in the understory also grow fast on average in response to gap formation. In other words, there is no tradeoff. However, the joint distribution of individual responses to understory and gap showed a negative correlation – species having individuals that respond most to gaps when previously growing slowly also have individuals that respond least to gaps when previously growing rapidly (e.g., Morus rubra), and vice versa (e.g., Quercus prinus). Conclusions/Significance Because competition occurs at the individual scale, not the species scale, aggregated species-level parameters and correlations hide the species-level differences needed for coexistence. By disaggregating models to the scale at which the interaction occurs we show that individual variation provides insight for species differences."
https://openalex.org/W1964855785,"Anthrax is caused by infection with Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium. A major virulence factor for B. anthracis is an immunomodulatory tripartite exotoxin that has been reported to alter immune cell chemotaxis and activation. It has been proposed that B. anthracis infections initiate through entry of spores into the regional draining lymph nodes where they germinate, grow, and disseminate systemically via the efferent lymphatics. If this model holds true, it would be predicted that surgical removal of infected tissues, debridement, would have little effect on the systemic dissemination of bacteria. This model was tested through the development of a mouse debridement model. It was found that removal of the site of subcutaneous infection in the ear increased the likelihood of survival and reduced the quantity of spores in the draining cervical lymph nodes (cLN). At the time of debridement 12 hours post-injection measurable levels of exotoxins were present in the ear, cLN, and serum, yet leukocytes within the cLN were activated; countering the concept that exotoxins inhibit the early inflammatory response to promote bacterial growth. We conclude that the initial entry of spores into the draining lymph node of cutaneous infections alone is not sufficient to cause systemic disease and that debridement should be considered as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2039136560,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the G1 cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes Cln1,-2,-3/Cdk1 promote S phase entry during the mitotic cell cycle but do not function during meiosis. It has been proposed that the meiosis-specific protein kinase Ime2, which is required for normal timing of pre-meiotic DNA replication, is equivalent to Cln1,-2/Cdk1. These two CDK complexes directly catalyze phosphorylation of the B-type cyclin/CDK inhibitor Sic1 during the cell cycle to enable its destruction. As a result, Clb5,-6/Cdk1 become activated and facilitate initiation of DNA replication. While Ime2 is required for Sic1 destruction during meiosis, evidence now suggests that Ime2 does not directly catalyze Sic1 phosphorylation to target it for destabilization as Cln1,-2/Cdk1 do during the cell cycle.We demonstrated that Sic1 is eventually degraded in meiotic cells lacking the IME2 gene (ime2Δ), supporting an indirect role of Ime2 in Sic1 destruction. We further examined global RNA expression comparing wild type and ime2Δ cells. Analysis of these expression data has provided evidence that Ime2 is required early in meiosis for normal transcription of many genes that are also periodically expressed during late G1 of the cell cycle.Our results place Ime2 at a position in the early meiotic pathway that lies upstream of the position occupied by Cln1,-2/Cdk1 in the analogous cell cycle pathway. Thus, Ime2 may functionally resemble Cln3/Cdk1 in promoting S phase entry, or it could play a role even further upstream in the corresponding meiotic cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2000305490,"A visual stimulus can be made invisible, i.e. masked, by the presentation of a second stimulus. In the sensory cortex, neural responses to a masked stimulus are suppressed, yet how this suppression comes about is still debated. Inhibitory models explain masking by asserting that the mask exerts an inhibitory influence on the responses of a neuron evoked by the target. However, other models argue that the masking interferes with recurrent or reentrant processing. Using computer modeling, we show that surround inhibition evoked by ON and OFF responses to the mask suppresses the responses to a briefly presented stimulus in forward and backward masking paradigms. Our model results resemble several previously described psychophysical and neurophysiological findings in perceptual masking experiments and are in line with earlier theoretical descriptions of masking. We suggest that precise spatiotemporal influence of surround inhibition is relevant for visual detection."
https://openalex.org/W1975974259,"Small regions called protein transduction domains (PTDs), identified in cellular and viral proteins, have been reported to efficiently cross biological membranes. Here we show that the structural Gag protein of the prototypic foamy virus (PFV) is apparently able to move from cell to cell and to transport the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from few transfected cells to the nuclei of the entire monolayer. Deletion studies showed that this property lies within the second glycine/arginine (GRII) box in the C-terminus of the protein. We also found that uptake and nuclear accumulation of Gag GRII expressed as GFP-fusion protein in recipient cells was observed only following methanol fixation, but never in living cells or when cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde or treated with trichloroacetic acid prior to methanol fixation. Absence of intercellular spreading in vivo was further confirmed using a sensitive luciferase activity assay based on transactivation of the PFV long terminal repeats. Thus, we conclude that intercellular spreading of PFV Gag represents an artificial diffusion event occurring during cell fixation, followed by nuclear retention mediated by the chromatin-binding sequence within the Gag GRII box. In light of these results, we advise caution before defining a peptide as PTD on the basis of intercellular spreading observed by fluorescence microscopy."
