https://openalex.org/W1989506279,"The electronic bandgap is an intrinsic property of semiconductors and insulators that largely determines their transport and optical properties. As such, it has a central role in modern device physics and technology and governs the operation of semiconductor devices such as p-n junctions, transistors, photodiodes and lasers. A tunable bandgap would be highly desirable because it would allow great flexibility in design and optimization of such devices, in particular if it could be tuned by applying a variable external electric field. However, in conventional materials, the bandgap is fixed by their crystalline structure, preventing such bandgap control. Here we demonstrate the realization of a widely tunable electronic bandgap in electrically gated bilayer graphene. Using a dual-gate bilayer graphene field-effect transistor (FET) and infrared microspectroscopy, we demonstrate a gate-controlled, continuously tunable bandgap of up to 250 meV. Our technique avoids uncontrolled chemical doping and provides direct evidence of a widely tunable bandgap-spanning a spectral range from zero to mid-infrared-that has eluded previous attempts. Combined with the remarkable electrical transport properties of such systems, this electrostatic bandgap control suggests novel nanoelectronic and nanophotonic device applications based on graphene."
https://openalex.org/W2121009566,"In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-OIV epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-OIV outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-OIV is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2100140007,"Osteoblasts and endothelium constitute functional niches that support haematopoietic stem cells in mammalian bone marrow. Adult bone marrow also contains adipocytes, the number of which correlates inversely with the haematopoietic activity of the marrow. Fatty infiltration of haematopoietic red marrow follows irradiation or chemotherapy and is a diagnostic feature in biopsies from patients with marrow aplasia. To explore whether adipocytes influence haematopoiesis or simply fill marrow space, we compared the haematopoietic activity of distinct regions of the mouse skeleton that differ in adiposity. Here we show, by flow cytometry, colony-forming activity and competitive repopulation assay, that haematopoietic stem cells and short-term progenitors are reduced in frequency in the adipocyte-rich vertebrae of the mouse tail relative to the adipocyte-free vertebrae of the thorax. In lipoatrophic A-ZIP/F1 'fatless' mice, which are genetically incapable of forming adipocytes, and in mice treated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma inhibitor bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, which inhibits adipogenesis, marrow engraftment after irradiation is accelerated relative to wild-type or untreated mice. These data implicate adipocytes as predominantly negative regulators of the bone-marrow microenvironment, and indicate that antagonizing marrow adipogenesis may enhance haematopoietic recovery in clinical bone-marrow transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2017117976,"Cells undergoing developmental processes are characterized by persistent non-genetic alterations in chromatin, termed epigenetic changes, represented by distinct patterns of DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications. Sirtuins, a group of conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases or ADP-ribosyltransferases, promote longevity in diverse organisms; however, their molecular mechanisms in ageing regulation remain poorly understood. Yeast Sir2, the first member of the family to be found, establishes and maintains chromatin silencing by removing histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation and bringing in other silencing proteins. Here we report an age-associated decrease in Sir2 protein abundance accompanied by an increase in H4 lysine 16 acetylation and loss of histones at specific subtelomeric regions in replicatively old yeast cells, which results in compromised transcriptional silencing at these loci. Antagonizing activities of Sir2 and Sas2, a histone acetyltransferase, regulate the replicative lifespan through histone H4 lysine 16 at subtelomeric regions. This pathway, distinct from existing ageing models for yeast, may represent an evolutionarily conserved function of sirtuins in regulation of replicative ageing by maintenance of intact telomeric chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2028861833,"Hypothalamic systems which regulate appetite may be permanently modified during early development. We have previously reported hyperphagia and increased adiposity in the adult offspring of rodents fed an obesogenic diet prior to and throughout pregnancy and lactation. We now report that offspring of obese (OffOb) rats display an amplified and prolonged neonatal leptin surge, which is accompanied by elevated leptin mRNA expression in their abdominal white adipose tissue. At postnatal Day 30, before the onset of hyperphagia in these animals, serum leptin is normal, but leptin-induced appetite suppression and phosphorylation of STAT3 in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) are attenuated; the level of AgRP-immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVH), which derives from neurones in the ARC and is developmentally dependent on leptin, is also diminished. We hypothesise that prolonged release of abnormally high levels of leptin by neonatal OffOb rats leads to leptin resistance and permanently affects hypothalamic functions involving the ARC and PVH. Such effects may underlie the developmental programming of hyperphagia and obesity in these rats."
https://openalex.org/W2023291646,"Brain-specific homing and direct interactions with the neural substance are prominent hypotheses for brain metastasis formation and a modern manifestation of Paget's “seed and soil” concept. However, there is little direct evidence for this “neurotropic” growth in vivo. In contrast, many experimental studies have anecdotally noted the propensity of metastatic cells to grow along the exterior of pre-existing vessels of the CNS, a process termed vascular cooption. These observations suggest the “soil” for malignant cells in the CNS may well be vascular, rather than neuronal. We used in vivo experimental models of brain metastasis and analysis of human clinical specimens to test this hypothesis. Indeed, over 95% of early micrometastases examined demonstrated vascular cooption with little evidence for isolated neurotropic growth. This vessel interaction was adhesive in nature implicating the vascular basement membrane (VBM) as the active substrate for tumor cell growth in the brain. Accordingly, VBM promoted adhesion and invasion of malignant cells and was sufficient for tumor growth prior to any evidence of angiogenesis. Blockade or loss of the β1 integrin subunit in tumor cells prevented adhesion to VBM and attenuated metastasis establishment and growth in vivo. Our data establishes a new understanding of CNS metastasis formation and identifies the neurovasculature as the critical partner for such growth. Further, we have elucidated the mechanism of vascular cooption for the first time. These findings may help inform the design of effective molecular therapies for patients with fatal CNS malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W1973591364,"The binding of the adaptor protein APPL1 to adiponectin receptors is necessary for adiponectin-induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in muscle, yet the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that in muscle cells adiponectin and metformin induce AMPK activation by promoting APPL1-dependent LKB1 cytosolic translocation. APPL1 mediates adiponectin signaling by directly interacting with adiponectin receptors and enhances LKB1 cytosolic localization by anchoring this kinase in the cytosol. Adiponectin also activates another AMPK upstream kinase Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase by activating phospholipase C and subsequently inducing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which plays a minor role in AMPK activation. Our results show that in muscle cells adiponectin is able to activate AMPK via two distinct mechanisms as follows: a major pathway (the APPL1/LKB1-dependent pathway) that promotes the cytosolic localization of LKB1 and a minor pathway (the phospholipase C/Ca2+/Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-dependent pathway) that stimulates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores."
https://openalex.org/W1553412652,"Part of the little we know about the atmospheres of extrasolar planets is gleaned from spectra obtained from starlight that has passed through the planetary atmosphere as it transits the stellar disk. As planet-finding techniques improve, the point where analogues of Earth are likely to be found is approaching. So what are we looking for? A good starting point for comparisons would be a transmission spectrum of our own planet. Now we have one, based on the characterization of sunlight reflected from the Moon towards the Earth during a lunar eclipse, a scenario that resembles the observing geometry of a planetary transit. This indirect method produces an optical and near-infrared transmission spectrum of the Earth. Some biologically relevant atmospheric features that are weak in reflected spectra are much stronger in the transmission spectrum, and stronger than predicted by modelling. Of the 342 planets so far discovered orbiting other stars, 58 'transit' the stellar disk; the light from the star passes through the atmosphere of the planet, and in a few cases the basic atmospheric composition of the planet can be estimated. The transmission spectrum of our planet, obtained during a lunar eclipse, is now reported, with implications for the search to find analogues of Earth. Of the 342 planets so far discovered1 orbiting other stars, 58 ‘transit’ the stellar disk, meaning that they can be detected through a periodic decrease in the flux of starlight2. The light from the star passes through the atmosphere of the planet, and in a few cases the basic atmospheric composition of the planet can be estimated3,4,5. As we get closer to finding analogues of Earth6,7,8, an important consideration for the characterization of extrasolar planetary atmospheres is what the transmission spectrum of our planet looks like. Here we report the optical and near-infrared transmission spectrum of the Earth, obtained during a lunar eclipse. Some biologically relevant atmospheric features that are weak in the reflection spectrum9 (such as ozone, molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide and methane) are much stronger in the transmission spectrum, and indeed stronger than predicted by modelling10,11. We also find the ‘fingerprints’ of the Earth’s ionosphere and of the major atmospheric constituent, molecular nitrogen (N2), which are missing in the reflection spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2094005687,"The impact of avian influenza caused by H9N2 viruses in Pakistan is now significantly more severe than in previous years. Since all gene segments contribute towards the virulence of avian influenza virus, it was imperative to investigate the molecular features and genetic relationships of H9N2 viruses prevalent in this region. Analysis of the gene sequences of all eight RNA segments from 12 viruses isolated between 2005 and 2008 was undertaken. The hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of all isolates were closely related to H9N2 viruses isolated from Iran between 2004 and 2007 and contained leucine instead of glutamine at position 226 in the receptor binding pocket, a recognised marker for the recognition of sialic acids linked alpha2-6 to galactose. The neuraminidase (NA) of two isolates contained a unique five residue deletion in the stalk (from residues 80 to 84), a possible indication of greater adaptation of these viruses to the chicken host. The HA, NA, nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix (M) genes showed close identity with H9N2 viruses isolated during 1999 in Pakistan and clustered in the A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 virus lineage. In contrast, the polymerase genes clustered with H9N2 viruses from India, Iran and Dubai. The NS gene segment showed greater genetic diversity and shared a high level of similarity with NS genes from either H5 or H7 subtypes rather than with established H9N2 Eurasian lineages. These results indicate that during recent years the H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive genetic reassortment which has led to the generation of H9N2 viruses of novel genotypes in the Indian sub-continent. The novel genotypes of H9N2 viruses may play a role in the increased problems observed by H9N2 to poultry and reinforce the continued need to monitor H9N2 infections for their zoonotic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2079951944,"The Cryptococcus species complex contains two sibling taxa, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Both species are basidiomycetous yeasts and major pathogens of humans and other mammals. Genotyping methods have identified major haploid molecular types of C. neoformans (VNI, VNII, VNB and VNIV) and of C. gattii (VGI, VGII, VGIII and VGIV). To investigate the phylogenetic relationships among these haploid genotypes, we selected 73 strains from 2000 globally collected isolates investigated in our previous typing studies, representing each of these genotypes and carried out multigene sequence analyses using four genetically unlinked nuclear loci, ACT1, IDE, PLB1 and URA5. The separate or combined sequence analyses of all four loci revealed seven clades with significant support for each molecular type. However, three strains of each species revealed some incongruence between the original molecular type and the sequence-based type obtained here. The topology of the individual gene trees was identical for each clade of C. neoformans but incongruent for the clades of C. gattii indicating recent recombination events within C. gattii. There was strong evidence of recombination in the global VGII population. Both parsimony and likelihood analyses supported three major clades of C. neoformans (VNI/VNB, VNII and VNIV) and four major clades of C. gattii (VGI, VGII, VGIII and VGIV). The sequence variation between VGI, VGIII and VGIV was similar to that between VNI/VNB and VNII. MATa was for the first time identified for VGIV. The VNIV and VGII clades are basal to the C. neoformans or the C. gattii clade, respectively. Divergence times among the seven haploid monophyletic lineages in the Cryptococcus species complex were estimated by applying the hypothesis of the molecular clock. The genetic variation found among all of these haploid monophyletic lineages indicates that they warrant varietal status."
https://openalex.org/W2104596915,"The variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism 5-repeat allele of the circadian gene PERIOD3 (PER3(5/5)) has been associated with cognitive decline at a specific circadian phase in response to a night of total sleep deprivation (TSD), relative to the 4-repeat allele (PER3(4/4)). PER3(5/5) has also been related to higher sleep homeostasis, which is thought to underlie this cognitive vulnerability. To date, no study has used a candidate gene approach to investigate the response to chronic partial sleep deprivation (PSD), a condition distinct from TSD and one commonly experienced by millions of people on a daily and persistent basis. We evaluated whether the PER3 VNTR polymorphism contributed to cumulative neurobehavioral deficits and sleep homeostatic responses during PSD.PER3(5/5) (n = 14), PER3(4/5) (n = 63) and PER3(4/4) (n = 52) healthy adults (aged 22-45 y) demonstrated large, but equivalent cumulative decreases in cognitive performance and physiological alertness, and cumulative increases in sleepiness across 5 nights of sleep restricted to 4 h per night. Such effects were accompanied by increasing daily inter-subject variability in all groups. The PER3 genotypes did not differ significantly at baseline in habitual sleep, physiological sleep structure, circadian phase, physiological sleepiness, cognitive performance, or subjective sleepiness, although during PSD, PER3(5/5) subjects had slightly but reliably elevated sleep homeostatic pressure as measured physiologically by EEG slow-wave energy in non-rapid eye movement sleep compared with PER3(4/4) subjects. PER3 genotypic and allelic frequencies did not differ significantly between Caucasians and African Americans.The PER3 VNTR polymorphism was not associated with individual differences in neurobehavioral responses to PSD, although it was related to one marker of sleep homoeostatic response during PSD. The comparability of PER3 genotypes at baseline and their equivalent inter-individual vulnerability to sleep restriction indicate that PER3 does not contribute to the neurobehavioral effects of chronic sleep loss."
https://openalex.org/W2037341476,"Meiosis in the haploid plant-pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola results in eight ascospores due to a mitotic division following the two meiotic divisions. The transient diploid phase allows for recombination among homologous chromosomes. However, some chromosomes of M. graminicola lack homologs and do not pair during meiosis. Because these chromosomes are not present universally in the genome of the organism they can be considered to be dispensable. To analyze the meiotic transmission of unequal chromosome numbers, two segregating populations were generated by crossing genetically unrelated parent isolates originating from Algeria and The Netherlands that had pathogenicity towards durum or bread wheat, respectively. Detailed genetic analyses of these progenies using high-density mapping (1793 DArT, 258 AFLP and 25 SSR markers) and graphical genotyping revealed that M. graminicola has up to eight dispensable chromosomes, the highest number reported in filamentous fungi. These chromosomes vary from 0.39 to 0.77 Mb in size, and represent up to 38% of the chromosomal complement. Chromosome numbers among progeny isolates varied widely, with some progeny missing up to three chromosomes, while other strains were disomic for one or more chromosomes. Between 15-20% of the progeny isolates lacked one or more chromosomes that were present in both parents. The two high-density maps showed no recombination of dispensable chromosomes and hence, their meiotic processing may require distributive disjunction, a phenomenon that is rarely observed in fungi. The maps also enabled the identification of individual twin isolates from a single ascus that shared the same missing or doubled chromosomes indicating that the chromosomal polymorphisms were mitotically stable and originated from nondisjunction during the second division and, less frequently, during the first division of fungal meiosis. High genome plasticity could be among the strategies enabling this versatile pathogen to quickly overcome adverse biotic and abiotic conditions in wheat fields."
https://openalex.org/W1993743046,"Alkyltransferase-like proteins (ATLs) share functional motifs with the cancer chemotherapy target O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) and paradoxically protect cells from the biological effects of DNA alkylation damage, despite lacking the reactive cysteine and alkyltransferase activity of AGT. Here we determine Schizosaccharomyces pombe ATL structures without and with damaged DNA containing the endogenous lesion O6-methylguanine or cigarette-smoke-derived O6-4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylguanine. These results reveal non-enzymatic DNA nucleotide flipping plus increased DNA distortion and binding pocket size compared to AGT. Our analysis of lesion-binding site conservation identifies new ATLs in sea anemone and ancestral archaea, indicating that ATL interactions are ancestral to present-day repair pathways in all domains of life. Genetic connections to mammalian XPG (also known as ERCC5) and ERCC1 in S. pombe homologues Rad13 and Swi10 and biochemical interactions with Escherichia coli UvrA and UvrC combined with structural results reveal that ATLs sculpt alkylated DNA to create a genetic and structural intersection of base damage processing with nucleotide excision repair. Alkylated DNA is directly repaired by enzymes known as alkyltransferases (AGTs). A related class of enzymes, the alkyltransferase-like proteins (ATLs), can also protect against alkylation damage, but lack alkyltransferase activity. To gain insight into how this occurs, Tubbs et al. have solved the structure of a yeast ATL in the presence and absence of damaged DNA. Like AGTs, the ATL flips the alkylated base out of the DNA helix, but in this case the lesion is then acted upon by proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway. This analysis of lesion-binding site conservation identifies new ATLs in sea anemone and ancestral archaea, indicating that ATL interactions are ancestral to present-day repair pathways in all domains of life. A class of enzymes known as alkyltransferase-like proteins (ATLs) can protect against alkylation damage to DNA. To gain insight into how this occurs, the structure of a yeast ATL has been solved in the presence and absence of damaged DNA, revealing that ATL flips the alkylated base out of the DNA helix, leaving the lesion to be acted on by proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2077717792,"Declining mobility is a major concern, as well as a major source of health care costs, among the elderly population. Lack of mobility is a primary cause of entry into managed care facilities, and a contributing factor to the frequency of damaging falls. Exercise-based therapies have shown great promise in sustaining mobility in elderly patients, as well as in rodent models. However, the genetic basis of the changing physiological responses to exercise during aging is not well understood. Here, we describe the first exercise-training paradigm in an invertebrate genetic model system. Flies are exercised by a mechanized platform, known as the Power Tower, that rapidly, repeatedly, induces their innate instinct for negative geotaxis. When young flies are subjected to a carefully controlled, ramped paradigm of exercise-training, they display significant reduction in age-related decline in mobility and cardiac performance. Fly lines with improved mitochondrial efficiency display some of the phenotypes observed in wild-type exercised flies. The exercise response in flies is influenced by the amount of protein and lipid, but not carbohydrate, in the diet. The development of an exercise-training model in Drosophila melanogaster opens the way to direct testing of single-gene based genetic therapies for improved mobility in aged animals, as well as unbiased genetic screens for loci involved in the changing response to exercise during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2034402828,"Natural products containing phosphorus-carbon bonds have found widespread use in medicine and agriculture. One such compound, phosphinothricin tripeptide, contains the unusual amino acid phosphinothricin attached to two alanine residues. Synthetic phosphinothricin (glufosinate) is a component of two top-selling herbicides (Basta and Liberty), and is widely used with resistant transgenic crops including corn, cotton and canola. Recent genetic and biochemical studies showed that during phosphinothricin tripeptide biosynthesis 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (HEP) is converted to hydroxymethylphosphonate (HMP). Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of this unprecedented C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bond cleavage reaction and X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme. The protein is a mononuclear non-haem iron(ii)-dependent dioxygenase that converts HEP to HMP and formate. In contrast to most other members of this family, the oxidative consumption of HEP does not require additional cofactors or the input of exogenous electrons. The current study expands the scope of reactions catalysed by the 2-His-1-carboxylate mononuclear non-haem iron family of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2024134273,"Background Recombinant adenovirus-vectored (Ad) tuberculosis (TB) vaccine platform has demonstrated great potential to be used either as a stand-alone or a boost vaccine in murine models. However, Ad TB vaccine remains to be evaluated in a more relevant and sensitive guinea pig model of pulmonary TB. Many vaccine candidates shown to be effective in murine models have subsequently failed to pass the test in guinea pig models. Methods and Findings Specific pathogen-free guinea pigs were immunized with BCG, AdAg85A intranasally (i.n), AdAg85A intramuscularly (i.m), BCG boosted with AdAg85A i.n, BCG boosted with AdAg85A i.m, or treated only with saline. The animals were then infected by a low-dose aerosol of M. tuberculosis (M.tb). At the specified times, the animals were sacrificed and the levels of infection in the lung and spleen were assessed. In separate studies, the long-term disease outcome of infected animals was monitored until the termination of this study. Immunization with Ad vaccine alone had minimal beneficial effects. Immunization with BCG alone and BCG prime-Ad vaccine boost regimens significantly reduced the level of M.tb infection in the tissues to a similar extent. However, while BCG alone prolonged the survival of infected guinea pigs, the majority of BCG-immunized animals succumbed by 53 weeks post-M.tb challenge. In contrast, intranasal or intramuscular Ad vaccine boosting of BCG-primed animals markedly improved the survival rate with 60% of BCG/Ad i.n- and 40% of BCG/Ad i.m-immunized guinea pigs still surviving by 74 weeks post-aerosol challenge. Conclusions Boosting, particularly via the intranasal mucosal route, with AdAg85A vaccine is able to significantly enhance the long-term survival of BCG-primed guinea pigs following pulmonary M.tb challenge. Our results thus support further evaluation of this viral-vectored TB vaccine in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2048603354,"Background Endoderm organ primordia become specified between gastrulation and gut tube folding in Amniotes. Although the requirement for RA signaling for the development of a few individual endoderm organs has been established a systematic assessment of its activity along the entire antero-posterior axis has not been performed in this germ layer. Methodology/Principal Findings RA is synthesized from gastrulation to somitogenesis in the mesoderm that is close to the developing gut tube. In the branchial arch region specific levels of RA signaling control organ boundaries. The most anterior endoderm forming the thyroid gland is specified in the absence of RA signaling. Increasing RA in anterior branchial arches results in thyroid primordium repression and the induction of more posterior markers such as branchial arch Hox genes. Conversely reducing RA signaling shifts Hox genes posteriorly in endoderm. These results imply that RA acts as a caudalizing factor in a graded manner in pharyngeal endoderm. Posterior foregut and midgut organ primordia also require RA, but exposing endoderm to additional RA is not sufficient to expand these primordia anteriorly. We show that in chick, in contrast to non-Amniotes, RA signaling is not only necessary during gastrulation, but also throughout gut tube folding during somitogenesis. Our results show that the induction of CdxA, a midgut marker, and pancreas induction require direct RA signaling in endoderm. Moreover, communication between CdxA+ cells is necessary to maintain CdxA expression, therefore synchronizing the cells of the midgut primordium. We further show that the RA pathway acts synergistically with FGF4 in endoderm patterning rather than mediating FGF4 activity. Conclusions/Significance Our work establishes that retinoic acid (RA) signaling coordinates the position of different endoderm organs along the antero-posterior axis in chick embryos and could serve as a basis for the differentiation of specific endodermal organs from ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2054355149,"Human central nervous system-stem cells grown as neurospheres (hCNS-SCns) self-renew, are multipotent, and have potential therapeutic applications following trauma to the spinal cord. We have previously shown locomotor recovery in immunodeficient mice that received a moderate contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) and hCNS-SCns transplantation 9 days post-injury (dpi). Engrafted hCNS-SCns exhibited terminal differentiation to myelinating oligodendrocytes and synapse-forming neurons. Further, selective ablation of human cells using Diphtheria toxin (DT) abolished locomotor recovery in this paradigm, suggesting integration of human cells within the mouse host as a possible mechanism for the locomotor improvement. However, the hypothesis that hCNS-SCns could alter the host microenvironment as an additional or alternative mechanism of recovery remained unexplored; we tested that hypothesis in the present study.Stereological quantification of human cells using a human-specific cytoplasmic marker demonstrated successful cell engraftment, survival, migration and limited proliferation in all hCNS-SCns transplanted animals. DT administration at 16 weeks post-transplant ablated 80.5% of hCNS-SCns. Stereological quantification for lesion volume, tissue sparing, descending serotonergic host fiber sprouting, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan deposition, glial scarring, and angiogenesis demonstrated no evidence of host modification within the mouse spinal cord as a result of hCNS-SCns transplantation. Biochemical analyses supplemented stereological data supporting the absence of neural stem-cell mediated host repair. However, linear regression analysis of the number of engrafted hCNS-SCns vs. the number of errors on a horizontal ladder beam task revealed a strong correlation between these variables (r = -0.78, p<0.05), suggesting that survival and engraftment were directly related to a quantitative measure of recovery.Altogether, the data suggest that the locomotor improvements associated with hCNS-SCns transplantation were not due to modifications within the host microenvironment, supporting the hypothesis that human cell integration within the host circuitry mediates functional recovery following a 9 day delayed transplant."

https://openalex.org/W2063345857,"Allergy is a major health problem in industrialized countries. The number of transgenic food crops is growing rapidly creating the need for allergenicity assessment before they are introduced into human food chain. While existing bioinformatic methods have achieved good accuracies for highly conserved sequences, the discrimination of allergens and non-allergens from allergen-like non-allergen sequences remains difficult. We describe AllerHunter, a web-based computational system for the assessment of potential allergenicity and allergic cross-reactivity in proteins. It combines an iterative pairwise sequence similarity encoding scheme with SVM as the discriminating engine. The pairwise vectorization framework allows the system to model essential features in allergens that are involved in cross-reactivity, but not limited to distinct sets of physicochemical properties. The system was rigorously trained and tested using 1,356 known allergen and 13,449 putative non-allergen sequences. Extensive testing was performed for validation of the prediction models. The system is effective for distinguishing allergens and non-allergens from allergen-like non-allergen sequences. Testing results showed that AllerHunter, with a sensitivity of 83.4% and specificity of 96.4% (accuracy = 95.3%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AROC = 0.928+/-0.004 and Matthew's correlation coefficient MCC = 0.738), performs significantly better than a number of existing methods using an independent dataset of 1443 protein sequences.

https://openalex.org/W2037648781,"Background Etoposide is a cancer drug that induces strand breaks in cellular DNA by inhibiting topoisomerase II (topoII) religation of cleaved DNA molecules. Although DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II always produces topoisomerase II-linked DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the action of etoposide also results in single-strand breaks (SSBs), since religation of the two strands are independently inhibited by etoposide. In addition, recent studies indicate that topoisomerase II-linked DSBs remain undetected unless topoisomerase II is removed to produce free DSBs. Methodology/Principal Findings To examine etoposide-induced DNA damage in more detail we compared the relative amount of SSBs and DSBs, survival and H2AX phosphorylation in cells treated with etoposide or calicheamicin, a drug that produces free DSBs and SSBs. With this combination of methods we found that only 3% of the DNA strand breaks induced by etoposide were DSBs. By comparing the level of DSBs, H2AX phosphorylation and toxicity induced by etoposide and calicheamicin, we found that only 10% of etoposide-induced DSBs resulted in histone H2AX phosphorylation and toxicity. There was a close match between toxicity and histone H2AX phosphorylation for calicheamicin and etoposide suggesting that the few etoposide-induced DSBs that activated H2AX phosphorylation were responsible for toxicity. Conclusions/Significance These results show that only 0.3% of all strand breaks produced by etoposide activate H2AX phosphorylation and suggests that over 99% of the etoposide induced DNA damage does not contribute to its toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2082010591,"Background Expression level of many genes shows abundant natural variation in human populations. The variations in gene expression are believed to contribute to phenotypic differences. Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the key regulators of gene expression. However, past studies have focused on the miRNA target genes and used loss- or gain-of-function approach that may not reflect natural association between miRNA and mRNAs. Methodology/Principal Findings To examine miRNA regulatory effect on global gene expression under endogenous condition, we performed pair-wise correlation coefficient analysis on expression levels of 366 miRNAs and 14,174 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in 90 immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines, and observed significant correlations between the two species of RNA transcripts. We identified a total of 7,207 significantly correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs (false discovery rate q<0.01). Of those, 4,085 pairs showed positive correlations while 3,122 pairs showed negative correlations. Gene ontology analyses on the miRNA-correlated genes revealed significant enrichments in several biological processes related to cell cycle, cell communication and signal transduction. Individually, each of three miRNAs (miR-331, -98 and -33b) demonstrated significant correlation with the genes in cell cycle-related biological processes, which is consistent with important role of miRNAs in cell cycle regulation. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates feasibility of using naturally expressed transcript profiles to identify endogenous correlation between miRNA and miRNA. By applying this genome-wide approach, we have identified thousands of miRNA-correlated genes and revealed potential role of miRNAs in several important cellular functions. The study results along with accompanying data sets will provide a wealth of high-throughput data to further evaluate the miRNA-regulated genes and eventually in phenotypic variations of human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2096258050,"The Bcl-x pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to produce the anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-x(S) isoforms. By performing deletion mutagenesis on a human Bcl-x minigene, we have identified a novel exonic element that controls the use of the 5' splice site of Bcl-x(S). The proximal portion of this element acts as a repressor and is located downstream of an enhancer. Further mutational analysis provided a detailed topological map of the regulatory activities revealing a sharp transition between enhancer and repressor sequences. Portions of the enhancer can function when transplanted in another alternative splicing unit. Chromatography and immunoprecipitation assays indicate that the silencer element interacts with heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle (hnRNP) K, consistent with the presence of putative high affinity sites for this protein. Finally, down-regulation of hnRNP K by RNA interference enhanced splicing to Bcl-x(S), an effect seen only when the sequences bound by hnRNP K are present. Our results therefore document a clear role for hnRNP K in preventing the production of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-x(S) splice isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2108338691,"Saliva (oral fluids) is an emerging biofluid poised for detection of clinical diseases. Although the rationale for oral diseases applications (e.g. oral cancer) is intuitive, the rationale and relationship between systemic diseases and saliva biomarkers are unclear.In this study, we used mouse models of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer and compared the transcriptome biomarker profiles of tumor-bearing mice to those of control mice. Microarray analysis showed that salivary transcriptomes were significantly altered in tumor-bearing mice vs. controls. Significant overlapping among transcriptomes of mouse tumors, serum, salivary glands and saliva suggests that salivary biomarkers have multiple origins. Furthermore, we identified that the expression of two groups of significantly altered transcription factors (TFs) Runx1, Mlxipl, Trim30 and Egr1, Tbx1, Nr1d1 in salivary gland tissue of melanoma-bearing mice can potentially be responsible for 82.6% of the up-regulated gene expression and 62.5% of the down-regulated gene expression, respectively, in the saliva of melanoma-bearing mice. We also showed that the ectopic production of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the melanoma tumor tissue as a tumor-released mediator can induce expression of the TF Egr-1 in the salivary gland.Taken together, our data support the conclusion that upon systemic disease development, significant changes can occur in the salivary biomarker profile. Although the origins of the disease-induced salivary biomarkers may be both systemic and local, stimulation of salivary gland by mediators released from remote tumors plays an important role in regulating the salivary surrogate biomarker profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2034245741,"In plants and insects, RNA interference (RNAi) is the main responder against viruses and shapes the basis of antiviral immunity. Viruses counter this defense by expressing viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs). While VSRs in Drosophila melanogaster were shown to inhibit RNAi through different modes of action, whether they act on other silencing pathways remained unexplored.Here we show that expression of various plant and insect VSRs in transgenic flies does not perturb the Drosophila microRNA (miRNA) pathway; but in contrast, inhibits antiviral RNAi and the RNA silencing response triggered by inverted repeat transcripts, and injection of dsRNA or siRNA. Strikingly, these VSRs also suppressed transposon silencing by endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs).Our findings identify VSRs as tools to unravel small RNA pathways in insects and suggest a cosuppression of antiviral RNAi and endo-siRNA silencing by viruses during fly infections."
https://openalex.org/W2008422349,"Current method to magnetically label cells using ferumoxides (Fe)-protamine (Pro) sulfate (FePro) is based on generating FePro complexes in a serum free media that are then incubated overnight with cells for the efficient labeling. However, this labeling technique requires long (>12–16 hours) incubation time and uses relatively high dose of Pro (5–6 µg/ml) that makes large extracellular FePro complexes. These complexes can be difficult to clean with simple cell washes and may create low signal intensity on T2* weighted MRI that is not desirable. The purpose of this study was to revise the current labeling method by using low dose of Pro and adding Fe and Pro directly to the cells before generating any FePro complexes. Human tumor glioma (U251) and human monocytic leukemia cell (THP-1) lines were used as model systems for attached and suspension cell types, respectively and dose dependent (Fe 25 to 100 µg/ml and Pro 0.75 to 3 µg/ml) and time dependent (2 to 48 h) labeling experiments were performed. Labeling efficiency and cell viability of these cells were assessed. Prussian blue staining revealed that more than 95% of cells were labeled. Intracellular iron concentration in U251 cells reached ∼30–35 pg-iron/cell at 24 h when labeled with 100 µg/ml of Fe and 3 µg/ml of Pro. However, comparable labeling was observed after 4 h across the described FePro concentrations. Similarly, THP-1 cells achieved ∼10 pg-iron/cell at 48 h when labeled with 100 µg/ml of Fe and 3 µg/ml of Pro. Again, comparable labeling was observed after 4 h for the described FePro concentrations. FePro labeling did not significantly affect cell viability. There was almost no extracellular FePro complexes observed after simple cell washes. To validate and to determine the effectiveness of the revised technique, human T-cells, human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSC), human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSC) and mouse neuronal stem cells (mNSC C17.2) were labeled. Labeling for 4 hours using 100 µg/ml of Fe and 3 µg/ml of Pro resulted in very efficient labeling of these cells, without impairing their viability and functional capability. The new technique with short incubation time using 100 µg/ml of Fe and 3 µg/ml of Pro is effective in labeling cells for cellular MRI."

However, the molecular mechanism by which β-catenin mediates gene expression is still poorly understood. Here, we show that cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1), which was recently shown to function as a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors, also interacts with β-catenin and enhances the ability of β-catenin to activate expression of transiently transfected reporter genes. Furthermore, association of CCAR1 with the promoter of an endogenous Wnt/β-catenin target gene in a colon cancer cell line depends on the presence of β-catenin. Depletion of CCAR1 inhibits expression of several Wnt/β-catenin target genes and suppresses anchorage-independent growth of the colon cancer cell line. Thus, CCAR1 is a novel component of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that plays an important role in transcriptional regulation by β-catenin and that, therefore, may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention in cancers involving aberrantly activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

In addition, mutational analyses of clinical specimens and experiments with transgenic mice have proven the importance of β-catenin stabilization in adenoma formation, which is the earliest event of colorectal carcinogenesis. Therefore, the Wnt pathway has been causally linked to various cancers, most notably to colorectal cancers.

In the absence of Wnt signals, there is only a small pool of cytosolic β-catenin under normal physiological conditions, due to constitutive phosphorylation of β-catenin via a multiprotein complex composed of Axin, casein kinase I α, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (14Ha N.C.

As a potent primary coactivator for LEF/TCF transcription factors, β-catenin binds directly to DNA-bound LEF/TCF proteins and serves as a platform for recruiting additional secondary coactivators to promoters of a variety of LEF/TCF target genes. Generally, these secondary coactivators assist β-catenin in mediating transcriptional activation either through modulation of chromatin conformation or recruitment and activation of RNA polymerase II and its associated basal transcription machinery (17Städeli R.

Although a number of interacting proteins have been identified, the molecular details of their cooperation with β-catenin to control transcription are still poorly understood. To further explore the mechanism of coactivator function by β-catenin, it is important to define the specific functional relationships of β-catenin with the interacting proteins and to determine their molecular and physiological roles in Wnt signaling. Cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) is a regulator of apoptosis signaling as well as cell proliferation. For example, CCAR1 triggers apoptosis signaling in a retinoid-dependent manner (47Rishi A.K. Zhang L. Boyanapalli M. Wali A. Mohammad R.M. Yu Y. Fontana J.A. Hatfield J.S. Dawson M.I. Majumdar A.P. Reichert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33422-33435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Additionally, cell growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-promoting effects elicited by inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor involve CCAR1 (48Rishi A.K. Zhang L. Yu Y. Jiang Y. Nautiyal J. Wali A.

On the other hand, CCAR1 has also been shown to be important for estrogen-induced gene expression and estrogen-dependent growth of human breast cancer cells (49Kim J.H. Yang C.K. Heo K. Roeder R.G. An W. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 510-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, previous studies suggest that CCAR1 can serve as a key intracellular transducer of either proliferation or apoptosis signaling pathways in response to different signals. Likewise, Wnt ligands are known as critical stimuli of the cellular communication network controlling multiple biological processes such as proliferation and cell fate determination. In addition, several coactivators for estrogen receptor and other nuclear receptors have also been found to cooperate with β-catenin in Wnt signaling. Hence, we speculated that CCAR1 may play a role in Wnt signaling. Here, we report that CCAR1 is a functional binding partner of β-catenin and assists β-catenin in transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes, some of which are implicated in proliferation and metastasis. In addition, depletion of CCAR1 inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of human colorectal cancer cells. Thus our results provided a novel insight into β-catenin-mediated tumorigenesis.

The PCR products were inserted into SpeI and PstI sites of pHRCMVpuroSin8. Short hairpin RNA encoding sequences targeting β-catenin were as follows: 5′-AAAACTGCAGAAAAAGCTTCCAGACACGTATCATGCGTTTCTCTTGAAAACGCACGATAGCGCGTCTGGAAGCGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAG-3′. The sh-CCAR1 transfer vector was described previously (49Kim J.H. Yang C.K. Heo K. Roeder R.G. An W. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 510-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). HT29 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5a medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin. CV-1, COS-7, and 293T cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin. For transient reporter gene assay, CV-1 cells were plated at 105 cells per well in 12-well plates and transiently transfected by TargeFect F1 reagent (Targeting Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total DNA in every well was adjusted to a constant amount by adding empty expression vectors. Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase assays on cell extracts were performed with Promega Luciferase Assay kit. Data shown are the mean and range of variation of duplicate transfected cultures from a single experiment and are representative of at least two independent experiments. Luciferase activities were not normalized to internal controls, because expression of so-called constitutive reporter genes is affected by overexpression of many coactivators. Instead, multiple independent experiments with multiple plasmid preparations were used to demonstrate reproducibility. HA-β-catenin, HA-LEF1, and HA-CCAR1 were synthesized in vitro by using the TnT-Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. These in vitro synthesized proteins were then used for GST pulldown assay as described previously (50Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated proteins and immobilized GST fusion proteins were mixed with NETN buffer (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, beads were washed with NETN three times, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-HA antibodies (Roche Applied Science). The amount of GST used as a negative control was always higher than that of GST fusion proteins. COS-7 cells were grown in 100-mm-diameter dishes seeded with 106 cells and transfected with expression plasmids pSG5.HA-CCAR1 and pSG5.HA-β-catenin using TargeFect F2 reagent (Targeting Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection cells were harvested with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with antibodies against β-catenin (BD Biosciences), normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), normal rabbit IgG (Bethyl Laboratories), or CCAR1 (Bethyl Laboratories). Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added, and the reaction was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-HA antibody. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (50Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, HT29 cells were grown in 150-mm cell culture dishes and treated with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with glycine, and cells were harvested and sonicated. After a pre-clearing step with Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), chromatin fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 4 μg of β-catenin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 8 μg of CCAR1 antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, 435A unless specified otherwise). Protein A/G beads were added to capture immune complexes, which were then washed extensively, eluted, and heated to reverse formaldehyde cross-linking. Purified immunoprecipitated DNA and total input DNA were utilized as template in quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using a Stratagene Mx3000P instrument. The qPCRs contained SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) and 150 nm of forward and reverse primers and were incubated through 40 cycles using the following conditions: 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. After the end of amplification, a melting curve analysis was carried out to confirm the homogeneity of products from each reaction. The primers used were as follows: hAxin2 3′-untranslated region (nucleotides +31681 to +31784 relative to transcription start site) (55Li J. Wang C.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); hAxin2 WRE (nucleotides −284 to −384 relative to transcription start site), 5′-TTTATAAAGTCCTCCAAGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGAACTGCAAGCAAGCAGATT-3′ (reverse); DKK1 Upstream Negative Control site (nucleotides −4462 to −4559 relative to transcription start site) (55Li J.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The relative standard curve method was utilized to determine the relative amount of immunoprecipitated DNA and input (unfractionated chromatin) signals. Signals from immunoprecipitated DNA were normalized to their respective input, and data were represented as the % of Input. In some experiments relative recruitment was calculated by dividing specific antibody signal by the signal from IgG_2 (Bethyl Laboratories). Data shown are mean and range of variation for two PCR reactions from a single experiment. In sequential ChIP experiments (50Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were eluted from primary immunoprecipitates by incubation with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. Eluates were then diluted 1:50 in immunoprecipitation dilution buffer and subjected to secondary immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. Total RNA from cell lines was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcribing 0.1 μg of total RNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). 1 μl of the reverse transcription reaction was amplified by qPCR using the following primers: β-actin (49Kim J.H.

Results shown are mean and range of variation for duplicate PCRs from a single cDNA preparation, and a minimum of two independent experiments were performed. Relative expression levels of target genes were determined by the standard curve method. All samples were corrected for total input RNA by normalizing to α-tubulin mRNA. HT29 cells (1000 cells per well) were seeded in 24-well dishes in McCoy's 5a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell numbers were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) assay (Promega CellTiter 96®) on the indicated days after plating. Results shown are the mean ± S.D. from triplicate cultures of a single experiment and are representative of two independent experiments. 0.8% of Noble agar (VWR International) in McCoy's 5a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin was poured into 60-mm Petri dishes and allowed to solidify at room temperature. For each cell pool, 4000 cells were suspended in 0.3% molten agar and layered on top of the solidified 0.8% agar in each dish. These dishes were then placed at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator for 2–4 weeks until colonies were visible. During that period, 1 ml of medium was added approximately every 2 days to prevent drying of the agar gel. Right before colony counting, dishes were fixed with 100% ethanol for 15 min and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet (VWR International) in phosphate-buffered saline (3.2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm KCl, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The colonies in each dish were counted by using the Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR System (Bio-Rad) and photographed by Leica microscopy (Plan-Apo 1×). Three dishes were set up for each cell line, and results shown are mean ± S.D. of the triplicate plates for a single experiment, which is representative of three independent experiments. Lentiviral particles were generated as described previously (56Naldini L. Blömer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each 100-mm plate of 293T cells, 8 μg of the transducing vector (pHRCMVpuroSin8-β-catenin or pHRCMVpuroSin8-CCAR1), 2.5 μg of the envelop plasmid pMD.G1, and 7.5 μg of the packaging vector pCMV ΔR8.91 were co-transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was changed the next day, and viruses were harvested by collecting the culture medium at 48 and 72 h post-transfection. Conditioned medium from 2 days was pooled, passed through a 0.45-μm filter,"

The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the putative impact of these KCNQ1 polymorphisms (rs2283228, rs2237892, rs2237895, and rs2237897) on estimates of glucose stimulated insulin release. Methodology/Principal Findings Genotypes were examined for associations with serum insulin levels following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in a population-based sample of 6,039 middle-aged and treatment-naïve individuals. Insulin release indices estimated from the OGTT and the interplay between insulin sensitivity and insulin release were investigated using linear regression and Hotelling T2 analyses. Applying an additive genetic model the minor C-allele of rs2237895 was associated with reduced serum insulin levels 30 min (mean±SD: (CC) 277±160 vs. (AC) 280±164 vs. (AA) 299±200 pmol/l, p = 0.008) after an oral glucose load, insulinogenic index (29.6±17.4 vs. 30.2±18.7vs. 32.2±22.1, p = 0.007), incremental area under the insulin curve (20,477±12,491 vs. 20,503±12,386 vs. 21,810±14,685, p = 0.02) among the 4,568 individuals who were glucose tolerant. Adjustment for the degree of insulin sensitivity had no effect on the measures of reduced insulin release. The rs2237895 genotype had a similar impact in the total sample of treatment-naïve individuals. No association with measures of insulin release were identified for the less common diabetes risk alleles of rs2237892, rs2237897, or rs2283228. Conclusion The minor C-allele of rs2237895 of KCNQ1, which has a prevalence of about 42% among Caucasians was associated with reduced measures of insulin release following an oral glucose load suggesting that the increased risk of type 2 diabetes, previously reported for this variant, likely is mediated through an impaired beta cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2120875536,"Separate lines of research have noted recruitment of parietal cortex during tasks involving visuo-spatial processes and empathy. To explore the relationship between these two functions, a self-other perspective transformation task and a task of spatial attention (line bisection) were administered to 40 healthy participants (19 women). Performance on these tasks was examined in relation to self-reported empathy. Rightward biases in line bisection correlated positively with trait-level self-reported empathic concern, suggesting a left hemisphere mediation of this prosocial personality trait. Unexpectedly, speed of perspective taking in the self-other transformation task correlated negatively with empathic concern, but only in women, which we interpret in light of gender differences in empathy and strategies for egocentric mental transformations. Together, the findings partially support the commonalities in visuo-spatial attention, perspective-taking and empathy. More broadly, they shed additional light on the relationship between basic cognitive functions and complex social constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1999687701,"The quaking viable (qk(v)) mice have uncompacted myelin in their central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS). The qk gene encodes 3 major alternatively spliced isoforms that contain unique sequence at their C-terminus dictating their cellular localization. QKI-5 is a nuclear isoform, whereas QKI-6 and QKI-7 are cytoplasmic isoforms. The qk(v) mice harbor an enhancer/promoter deletion that prevents the expression of isoforms QKI-6 and QKI-7 in myelinating cells resulting in a dysmyelination phenotype. It was shown that QKI regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, however, little is known about the role of the QKI proteins, or RNA binding proteins in PNS myelination.To define the role of the QKI proteins in PNS myelination, we ectopically expressed QKI-6 and QKI-7 in primary rat Schwann cell/neuron from dorsal root ganglia cocultures. We show that the QKI isoforms blocked proliferation and promoted Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. In addition, these events were coordinated with elevated proteins levels of p27(KIP1) and myelin basic protein (MBP), markers of Schwann cell differentiation. QKI-6 and QKI-7 expressing co-cultures contained myelinated fibers that had directionality and contained significantly thicker myelin, as assessed by electron microscopy. Moreover, QKI-deficient Schwann cells had reduced levels of MBP, p27(KIP1) and Krox-20 mRNAs, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR.Our findings suggest that the QKI-6 and QKI-7 RNA binding proteins are positive regulators of PNS myelination and show that the QKI RNA binding proteins play a key role in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination."

https://openalex.org/W2014071665,"Background Jaundice is one of the most common problems encountered in newborn infants, due to immaturity of hepatic conjugation and transport processes for bilirubin. Although the majority of neonatal jaundice is benign, some neonates with severe hyperbilirubinemia develop bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) in selected brain regions may result in temporary or permanent impairments of auditory, motor, or cognitive function; however, the molecular mechanisms by which UCB elicits such neurotoxicity are still poorly understood. The present study is undertaken to investigate whether prolonged exposure of rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures to UCB alters the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity. Methodology/Principal Findings Using electrophysiological recording techniques, we find that exposure of hippocampal slice cultures to clinically relevant concentrations of UCB for 24 or 48 h results in an impairment of CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) induction in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Hippocampal slice cultures stimulated with UCB show no changes in the secretion profiles of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, or the propidium ioide uptake. UCB treatment produced a significant decrease in the levels of NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors through a calpain-mediated proteolytic cleavage mechanism. Pretreatment of the hippocampal slice cultures with NMDA receptor antagonist or calpain inhibitors effectively prevented the UCB-induced impairment of LTP and LTD. Conclusion/Significance Our results indicate that the proteolytic cleavage of NMDA receptor subunits by calpain may play a critical role in mediating the UCB-induced impairment of long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. These observations provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying UCB-induced impairment of hippocampal synaptic plasticity which, in turn, might provide opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that targets these pathways for treatment."

Utilization of exogenous lipoate is catalyzed by a ligation reaction that proceeds via a lipoyl-adenylate intermediate to attach the cofactor to the ϵ-amino group of a conserved lysine residue of protein lipoyl domains. The lipoyl ligases of demonstrated function have a large N-terminal catalytic domain and a small C-terminal accessory domain. Half of the members of the LplA family detected in silico have only the large catalytic domain. Two x-ray structures of the Thermoplasma acidophilum LplA structure have been reported, although the protein was reported to lack ligase activity. McManus et al. (McManus, E., Luisi, B. F., and Perham, R. N. (2006) J. Mol. Biol. 356, 625–637) hypothesized that the product of an adjacent gene was also required for ligase activity. We have shown this to be the case and have named the second protein, LplB. We found that complementation of Escherichia coli strains lacking lipoate ligase with T. acidophilum LplA was possible only when LplB was also present. LplA had no detectable ligase activity in vitro in the absence of LplB. Moreover LplA and LplB were shown to interact and were purified as a heterodimer. LplB was required for lipoyl-adenylate formation but was not required for transfer of the lipoyl moiety of lipoyl-adenylate to acceptor proteins. Surveys of sequenced genomes show that most lipoyl ligases of the kingdom Archaea are heterodimeric.

Lipoic acid is a covalently bound cofactor that conveys activated reaction intermediates between different active sites of multienzyme complexes (1Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Lipoate is essential for aerobic metabolism of 2-oxoacids and for glycine cleavage. In its active form lipoate is attached to the ϵ-amino group of a small (∼80-residue) well conserved lipoyl domain (LD) 2The abbreviations used are: LDlipoyl domainCTDC-terminal domainNTAnitrilotriacetic acidE1E2, and E3, the three subunits of the 2-oxoacid complexes. 2The abbreviations used are: LDlipoyl domainCTDC-terminal domainNTAnitrilotriacetic acidE1E2, and E3, the three subunits of the 2-oxoacid complexes. lysine residue via an amide bond. LDs are typically found at the N termini of the E2 subunits of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes. In the 2-oxoacid complexes, lipoylated LD receives the decarboxylated acid from the E1 subunit active site in thioester linkage to a lipoate thiol. The acyl thioester is then converted to the corresponding CoA thioester by thioester exchange catalyzed by the E2 subunit active site. The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase subunit (E3) then oxidizes the dihydrolipoyl-LD back to the lipoyl-LD to reset the catalytic cycle. In the glycine cleavage (also called glycine decarboxylase and glycine dehydrogenase) system, the lipoyl domain exists as a free protein designated H. Lipoyl-LD receives the product of glycine decarboxylation, methylamine, from the P protein. The methylamine is then transferred to the T protein to produce methylenetetrahydrofolate that is typically used to synthesize serine from a second molecule of glycine. In Escherichia coli, lipoic acid is essential for aerobic growth because of the need for pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. The glycine cleavage system is not required for growth of wild type E. coli strains but is required for growth of Arabidopsis where the H protein can be present at millimolar concentrations in photosynthetic cells (2Engel N. van den Daele K.

The reactions whereby lipoic acid-modified proteins are produced are best understood in E. coli. The most straightforward pathway is via lipoate-protein ligase, an activity first described by L. J. Reed et al. (3Reed L.J. Leach F.R. Koike M. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 123-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). These workers postulated that lipoate was attached to protein by a two-step ATP-dependent reaction with lipoyl-AMP as an activated intermediate (Fig. 1). Although the lipoate-protein ligases were key reagents in demonstration of the role of lipoic acid in the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase reactions (3Reed L.J. Leach F.R. Koike M. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 123-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Koike M. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1931-1938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the protein was not purified to homogeneity, and thus the proposed mechanism could not be considered proved. The E. coli lplA gene was the first gene encoding a lipoate-protein ligase isolated, and LplA was the first such ligase purified to homogeneity (5Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation of null mutants in lplA showed that LplA does not play a role in de novo lipoic acid synthesis but rather acts to scavenge lipoic acid from the environment (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). LplA is a 38-kDa monomeric protein (5Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Assays with a fully defined system have demonstrated that LplA plus lipoate and Mg-ATP are sufficient to reconstitute lipoylation in vitro and that lipoyl-AMP is a reaction intermediate (5Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Eichhorn K. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that LplA catalyzes both the ATP-dependent activation of lipoate to lipoyl-AMP as well as the transfer of this activated lipoyl species to apoprotein with concomitant release of AMP. The E. coli LplA enzyme has been shown to be capable of utilizing lipoate and several lipoate analogues such as octanoate as donors for the post-translational modification of E2 apoproteins in vivo (5Green D.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently crystal structures of E. coli LplA and of LplA homologues have been reported including an E. coli LplA-lipoic acid complex (10Fujiwara K. Toma S. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. Nakagawa A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33645-33651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Kim D.J. Kim K.H. Lee H.H. Lee S.J. Ha J.Y. Yoon H.J. Suh S.W. J. Biol.

Biol. 2006; 356: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reported structures of the unliganded proteins agree well and show E. coli LplA to be a two-domain protein consisting of a large N-terminal domain and a small C-terminal domain (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). However, the E. coli LplA-lipoic acid complex is difficult to interpret because lipoic acid molecules were heterogeneously bound to LplA molecules within the crystals and were poorly resolved. In one case the lipoic acid carboxyl was hydrogen-bonded to Ser-72, whereas in another case Arg-140 was the hydrogen bond donor (10Fujiwara K. Toma S. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. Nakagawa A.

Because enzymes rarely show such plasticity and lipoic acid is a hydrophobic molecule, it seemed possible that the observed association of the cofactor with a hydrophobic LplA surface in the interdomain cavity was artifactual. Moreover in prior work K. E. Reed et al. (13Reed K.E. Morris T.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) had isolated LplA mutants resistant to inhibition by an analogue of lipoic acid in which the sulfur atoms had been replaced with selenium. Because this is a very discrete modification of the LplA substrate, the mutant protein would be expected to have an alteration close to the pocket that binds the lipoic acid thiolane ring. However, the site of this mutation (Gly-76 to serine (7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)) was distal from the lipoate binding site reported. This dilemma was resolved by two lipoic acid-containing structures of an LplA homologue from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum (11Kim D.J. Kim K.H. Lee H.H. Lee S.J. Ha J.Y. Yoon H.J. Suh S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38081-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12McManus E. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that can be readily superimposed on the E. coli LplA structure except that the T. acidophilum protein lacks the E. coli LplA C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). In both T. acidophilum structures the lipoate thiolane ring was adjacent to the glycine residue that corresponds to E. coli Gly-76, the residue giving resistance to the selenium analogue, and a plausible reorganization of the molecule to prevent binding of the slightly larger analogue was proposed (12McManus E. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover addition of lipoic acid to a complex of the T. acidophilum LplA with ATP gave lipoyl-AMP showing that the lipoic acid was bound in a physiologically meaningful manner (11Kim D.J. Kim K.H. Lee H.H. Lee S.J. Ha J.Y. Yoon H.J. Suh S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38081-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The lipoyl-AMP was bound in a U-shaped pocket and was well shielded from solvent. Thus, it seems that the locations of the lipoate moieties in the two T. acidophilum LplA structures indicate that these represent catalytically competent lipoate binding sites (rather than the sites of E. coli LplA where lipoate bound). A caveat was that the T. acidophilum LplA was inactive in catalysis of the overall LplA reaction (12McManus E. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because T. acidophilum LplA lacks the C-terminal domain (CTD) of E. coli LplA (11Kim D.J. Kim K.H. Lee H.H. Lee S.J. Ha J.Y. Yoon H.J. Suh S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38081-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12McManus E. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this suggested that the missing domain was required for activity, and a second protein was proposed to interact with T. acidophilum LplA to allow the complete reaction (12McManus E. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). If this were the case, the T. acidophilum lipoyl ligase would provide an unusually facile system to investigate the role of the CTD in lipoate-protein ligases. If the lipoate-protein ligase reaction can be catalyzed by a heteromeric protein this may allow better discrimination of lipoyl ligases from acyl carrier protein:protein octanoyltransferases. In E. coli de novo lipoic acid biosynthesis is accomplished by two enzymes, the LipB octanoyltransferase and the LipA lipoyl synthase (14Cronan J.E. Zhao X. Jiang Y. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2005; 50: 103-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). LipB transfers the octanoate moiety from the octanoyl-acyl carrier protein intermediate of fatty acid biosynthesis to the ϵ-amine of the conserved LD lysine residue resulting in amide-linked octanoate (Fig. 1). LipA then catalyzes replacement of a hydrogen atom on each of octanoate carbons 6 and 8 with sulfur atoms derived from a LipA iron-sulfur center via an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent radical mechanism (14Cronan J.E. Zhao X. Jiang Y. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2005; 50: 103-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Cicchillo R.M. Booker S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). That is, lipoic acid is assembled on its cognate proteins (16Zhao X. Miller J.R. Jiang Y. Marletta M.A. Cronan J.E. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1293-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although the two classes of LD-modifying enzymes, LplA and LipB, show very low amino acid sequence conservation and utilize different chemistries, the proteins surprisingly show structural conservation and have related active site architectures (17Kim do J. Lee S.J. Kim H.S. Kim K.H. Lee H.H. Yoon H.J. Suh S.W. Proteins. 2008; 70: 1620-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Ma Q. Zhao X. Nasser Eddine A. Geerlof A. Li X. Cronan J.E. Kaufmann S.H. Wilmanns M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The Mycobacterium tuberculosis LipB and T. acidophilum LplA can be superimposed by using all matching Cα positions with a root mean square deviation of ≈2.5 Å with good topological matching of most secondary structural elements (18Ma Q. Zhao X. Nasser Eddine A. Geerlof A. Li X. Cronan J.E. Kaufmann S.H. Wilmanns M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hence in length and structure LipBs resemble LplAs that lack the C-terminal domain. Although the E. coli LipB and LplA sequences align very poorly, a large number of proteins in the data bases have similarities to both proteins, and therefore annotation of a given protein as a ligase or octanoyltransferase is not straightforward. If an LplA CTD can be a separate protein, an additional criterion to distinguish lipoate ligases and octanoyltransferases would be available. It should be noted that biotin ligases also show structural (but not sequence) conservation with LipB and LplA, and this group of proteins comprises the Pfam family PF03099 (19Finn R.D. Tate J. Mistry J. Coggill P.C. Sammut S.J. Hotz H.R. Ceric G. Forslund K. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D281-D288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). However, all known biotin ligases have a C-terminal domain that greatly aids in their annotation. We report that, as predicted by McManus et al. (12McManus E. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the CTD function essential for lipoate-protein ligase activity is encoded by a gene located immediately upstream of T. acidophilum lplA that we call lplB. LB rich and M9 minimal media were prepared as described previously (20Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-433Google Scholar). Bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C. T. acidophilum DSM 128 genomic DNA was purchased from the ATCC. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and are shown in Table 1. PCR amplification was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), and A overhangs were added with Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). The TOPO TA Cloning kit was used for cloning PCR products into the pCR2.1 vector supplied (Invitrogen), and the Topoisomerase Cloning kit was used for pET101 (Invitrogen). DNA constructs were sequenced by the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center of the University of Illinois. Plasmids, strains, and primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Strain QC146 was constructed by the method of Datsenko and Wanner (21Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11049) Google Scholar). The lplA gene was replaced with a kanamycin resistance cassette by transformation of the PCR product obtained using primers Q017 and Q018. The lipB gene was replaced with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette using the PCR product obtained using primers Q019 and Q020. The insertions were transduced with phage P1 into the wild type strain MG1655, the antibiotic cassettes were removed using the Flp protein encoded by the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20 (21Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11049) Google Scholar), and the lipB lplA phenotype was verified on M9 0.2% glucose medium comparing growth with 5 μg/ml lipoic acid or 5 mm acetate plus 5 mm succinate. The strains are described in Table 1. The TA0513 and TA0514 open reading frames were amplified as a single fragment by PCR from T. acidophilum genomic DNA using primers Q007 and Q008, which added terminal NcoI and HindIII sites. This product was directly cloned into the same sites of pBAD322G (22Cronan J.E. Plasmid. 2006; 55: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter to give pQC005. TA0514 was amplified with primers Q027 and Q008, which added NcoI and HindIII sites, and TA cloned into pCR2.1 to give pQC019 followed by insertion between the NdeI and HindIII site of pBAD322G to give pQC021. TA0513 was amplified with primers Q007 and Q025 and TA cloned into pCR2.1 to give pQC020 followed by insertion between the NdeI and XbaI sites of pBAD322G to give pQC022. A derivative of TA0514 having an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was amplified from genomic DNA using primers Q026 and Q008, which also added the N-terminal hexahistidine tag sequence. The product was TOPO cloned directly into pET101 to give pQC017. TA0513m was amplified using primers Q069 and Q068, which added an EcoRI site, a ribosome binding site, an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, and an XhoI site. This product was directly cloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pET19b to give pQC043. The LD of the E2 subunit of the branched chain dehydrogenase was determined by alignment to the LD derived by proteolytic digestion of Bacillus stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunit (23Packman L.C. Perham R.N. Roberts G.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The domain contains the first 86 amino acids of the branched chain dehydrogenase E2 from open reading frame TA1436. The domain was amplified from genomic DNA with primers Q032 and Q033 creating an NdeI restriction site within the initiation codon and a stop codon following codon 86. This was TA cloned into pCR2.1 to give pQC028. The gene was then ligated between the NdeI and SacI sites of pET30(a)+ to give pQC024. A putative T. acidophilum gcvH, open reading frame TA1366m, was found by homology and was amplified with primers Q050 and Q049, which introduced a C-terminal hexahistidine tag and a BspHI site that overlapped the initiation codon. The product was TA cloned into pCR2.1 to give pQC034 and subsequently inserted into the NcoI and XbaI sites of pET28(b)+ to give pQC035. TA0514 was cut from pQC021 with NcoI and HindIII and inserted between the same sites of pRSF-1b to give pQC055. TA0513 was digested from pQC022 and ligated into the NcoI and XbaI sites of pRSF-1b to give pQC056. Identification and bioinformatics characterization of single domain homologues of LplB were done using the Berkeley Phylogenomics Website (24Glanville J.G. Kirshner D. Krishnamurthy N. Sjölander K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W27-W32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Twenty- six homologues were identified using the TA0513m protein sequence from 10 iterations of SHMM (subfamily hidden Markov model) and PSI-BLAST (position-specific iterative basic local alignment search tool). Genome comparison, homology searches, and lipoic acid subsystem analyses were performed using the National Microbial Pathogen Database Resource (25McNeil L.K. Reich C. Aziz R.K. Bartels D. Cohoon M.

Strains JK1 and TM131 containing pBAD322G expressing the indicated ligase proteins were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 5 mm acetate, 5 mm succinate, and 5 mg/liter lipoic acid. The cells were harvested at an A600 of 0.6 by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at ∼100 mg of wet weight/ml. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at ∼20,000 p.s.i. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min. Assays of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex activities were a modification of previous continuous spectrophotometric assays (27Amarasingham C.R. Davis B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3664-3668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Guest J.R. Creaghan I.T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1973; 75: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 3 mml-cysteine, 0.1 mm CoA, 0.5 mm thiamin pyrophosphate, and 2 mm acetylated NAD analogue (2-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide). For assays of pyruvate dehydrogenase, 5 mm MgCl2 was also included to give maximal activity. Cell extract protein contents were determined using the using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. The amount of extract assayed varied from 100 to 1 μg/ml final concentration. Each assay began by addition of 50 mm substrate (pyruvate or 2-oxoglutarate) at 25 °C. The reduction of 2-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide was measured at 366 nm, and the extinction coefficient of the reduced form in the assay buffer was experimentally determined to be 7.0 mm−1 cm−1. Purification of hexahistidine-tagged versions of LplA and LplB was done using Ni2+ affinity chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. Plasmids QC048 and QC049 were transformed into strain Rosetta2 DE3, and the transformants were grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At an A600 of 0.6 expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-Β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h before harvest and storage of the cell pellets at −80 °C. All chromatography steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm imidazole) and lysed using a French pressure cell. The lysate was cleared at 48,000 × g for 15 min, and 5 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen) was added to the cleared lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. The resin was packed into a 0.75-inch column and washed with at least 10 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole) by gravity flow. The protein was eluted with the same buffer (elution buffer) containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and subjected to anion exchange using a 1-ml POROS HQ 20 column with a gradient o"

Employing genetic as well as chemical intervention, we provide evidence that a tight regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is essential for muscle fiber growth and maintenance. In zebrafish embryos, gain-of-Wnt/beta-catenin function results in unscheduled muscle progenitor proliferation, leading to slow and fast muscle hypertrophy accompanied by fast muscle degeneration. The effects of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling on fast muscle hypertrophy were rescued by misexpression of Myostatin or p21(CIP/WAF), establishing an in vivo regulation of myofibrillogenesis by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and Myostatin. Epistatic analyses suggest a possible genetic interaction between Wnt/beta-catenin and Myostatin in regulation of slow and fast twitch muscle myofibrillogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2162678621,"There is increasing evidence that p63, and specifically ΔNp63, plays a central role in both development and tumorigenesis by promoting epithelial cell survival. However, few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms through which such important function is exerted. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme that synthesizes long-chain fatty acids and is involved in both embryogenesis and cancer, has been recently proposed as a direct target of p53 family members, including p63 and p73. Here we show that knockdown of either total or ΔN-specific p63 isoforms in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC9) or immortalized prostate epithelial (iPrEC) cells caused a decrease in cell viability by inducing apoptosis without affecting the cell cycle. p63 silencing significantly reduced both the expression and the activity of FASN. Importantly, stable overexpression of either FASN or myristoylated AKT (myr-AKT) was able to partially rescue cells from cell death induced by p63 silencing. FASN induced AKT phosphorylation and a significant reduction in cell viability was observed when FASN-overexpressing SCC9 cells were treated with an AKT inhibitor after p63 knockdown, indicating that AKT plays a major role in FASN-mediated survival. Activated AKT did not cause any alteration in the FASN protein levels but induced its activity, suggesting that the rescue from apoptosis documented in the p63-silenced cells expressing myr-AKT cells may be partially mediated by FASN. Finally, we demonstrated that p63 and FASN expression are positively associated in clinical squamous cell carcinoma samples as well as in the developing prostate. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that FASN is a functionally relevant target of p63 and is required for mediating its pro-survival effects."

We investigated fetal mRNA detection in maternal whole blood and determined if it offered advantages over maternal plasma analysis.The concentrations of placental expressed genes, CSH1, KISS1, PLAC4 and PLAC1 in plasma and whole blood from healthy pregnant and non-pregnant individuals were compared by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. Their fetal specificity was investigated by comparing the transcript concentrations in pre- and post-delivery samples and through SNP genotyping by matrix-assisted laser-desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The gene expression profiles of pregnant and non-pregnant whole blood were investigated by microarray analysis. Upregulated genes in pregnant whole blood were selected for further quantitative analysis.The concentrations of the four transcripts were significantly higher in third trimester maternal whole blood than corresponding plasma without significant correlations. KISS1, PLAC4 and PLAC1 were detected in non-pregnant whole blood but not plasma. The transcripts remained detectable in some postpartum whole blood samples. The PLAC4 mRNA in maternal plasma showed fetal genotype while that in corresponding whole blood indicated both fetal and maternal contributions. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in neutrophil functions in pregnant whole blood including DEFA4, CEACAM8, OLFM4, ORM1, MMP8 and MPO. Though possibly pregnancy-related, they were not pregnancy-specific as suggested by the lack of post-delivery reduction in concentrations.Maternal plasma is preferred over maternal whole blood for placenta-derived fetal RNA detection. Most studied 'placental' mRNA molecules in maternal whole blood were of maternal origin and might be derived from processes such as 'illegitimate transcription'."
https://openalex.org/W1980121199,"Background Tumorigenesis requires multiple genetic changes. Mutator mutations are mutations that increase genomic instability, and according to the mutator hypothesis, accelerate tumorigenesis by facilitating oncogenic mutations. Alternatively, repeated lineage selection and expansion without increased mutation frequency may explain observed cancer incidence. Mutator lineages also risk increased deleterious mutations, leading to extinction, thus providing another counterargument to the mutator hypothesis. Both selection and extinction involve changes in lineage fitness, which may be represented as “trajectories” through a “fitness landscape” defined by genetics and environment. Methodology/Principal Findings Here I systematically analyze the relative efficiency of tumorigenesis with and without mutator mutations by evaluating archetypal fitness trajectories using deterministic and stochastic mathematical models. I hypothesize that tumorigenic mechanisms occur clinically in proportion to their relative efficiency. This work quantifies the relative importance of mutator pathways as a function of experimentally measurable parameters, demonstrating that mutator pathways generally enhance efficiency of tumorigenesis. An optimal mutation rate for tumor evolution is derived, and shown to differ from that for species evolution. Conclusions/Significance The models address the major counterarguments to the mutator hypothesis, confirming that mutator mechanisms are generally more efficient routes to tumorigenesis than non-mutator mechanisms. Mutator mutations are more likely to occur early, and to occur when more oncogenic mutations are required to create a tumor. Mutator mutations likely occur in a minority of premalignant lesions, but these mutator premalignant lesions are disproportionately likely to develop into malignant tumors. Tumor heterogeneity due to mutator mutations may contribute to therapeutic resistance, and the degree of heterogeneity of tumors may need to be considered when therapeutic strategies are devised. The model explains and predicts important biological observations in bacterial and mouse systems, as well as clinical observations."
https://openalex.org/W2011660410,"Background The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the etiologic agent of typhoid fever, has aggravated an already important public health problem and added new urgency to the development of more effective typhoid vaccines. To this end it is critical to better understand the induction of immunity to S. Typhi. CD8+ T cells are likely to play an important role in host defense against S. Typhi by several effector mechanisms, including killing of infected cells and IFN-γ secretion. However, how S. Typhi regulates the development of specific CD8+ responses in humans remains unclear. Recent studies in mice have shown that dendritic cells (DC) can either directly (upon uptake and processing of Salmonella) or indirectly (by bystander mechanisms) elicit Salmonella-specific CD8+ T cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We report here that upon infection with live S. Typhi, human DC produced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, but low levels of IL-12 p70 and IFN-γ. In contrast, DC co-cultured with S. Typhi-infected cells, through suicide cross-presentation, uptake S. Typhi-infected human cells and release high levels of IFN-γ and IL-12p70, leading to the subsequent presentation of bacterial antigens and triggering the induction of memory T cells, mostly CD3+CD8+CD45RA−CD62L− effector/memory T cells. Conclusions/Significance This study is the first to demonstrate the effect of S. Typhi on human DC maturation and on their ability to prime CD8+ cells and highlights the significance of these phenomena in eliciting adaptive immunity to S. Typhi."
https://openalex.org/W2049314371,"The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of half of the human population, and causes development of peptic ulcer disease and gastric adenocarcinoma. H. pylori-associated chronic atrophic gastritis (ChAG) with loss of the acid-producing parietal cells, is correlated with an increased risk for development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The majority of H. pylori isolates produce lipopolysaccharides (LPS) decorated with human-related Lewis epitopes, which have been shown to phase-vary in response to different environmental conditions. We have characterized the adaptations of H. pylori LPS and Lewis antigen expression to varying gastric conditions; in H. pylori isolates from mice with low or high gastric pH, respectively; in 482 clinical isolates from healthy individuals and from individuals with ChAG obtained at two time points with a four-year interval between endoscopies; and finally in isolates grown at different pH in vitro. Here we show that the gastric environment can contribute to a switch in Lewis phenotype in the two experimental mouse models. The clinical isolates from different human individuals showed that intra-individual isolates varied in Lewis antigen expression although the LPS diversity was relatively stable within each individual over time. Moreover, the isolates demonstrated considerable diversity in the levels of glycosylation and in the sizes of fucosylated O-antigen chains both within and between individuals. Thus our data suggest that different LPS variants exist in the colonizing H. pylori population, which can adapt to changes in the gastric environment and provide a means to regulate the inflammatory response of the host during disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2080899318,"The degradation of the aromatic compound phenylpropionate (PP) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 requires the activation of two different catabolic pathways coded by the <i>hca</i> and the <i>mhp</i> gene clusters involved in the mineralization of PP and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate (3HPP), respectively. The compound 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) is a common intermediate of both pathways which must be cleaved by the MhpB dioxygenase before entering into the primary cell metabolism. Therefore, the degradation of PP has to be controlled by both its specific regulator (HcaR) but also by the MhpR regulator of the <i>mhp</i> cluster. We have demonstrated that 3HPP and DHPP are the true and best activators of MhpR, whereas PP only induces no response. However, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> transcription experiments have demonstrated that PP activates the MhpR regulator synergistically with the true inducers, representing the first case of such a peculiar synergistic effect described for a bacterial regulator. The three compounds enhanced the interaction of MhpR with its DNA operator in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Inducer binding to MhpR is detected by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies. Fluorescence quenching measurements have revealed that the true inducers (3HPP and DHPP) and PP bind with similar affinities and independently to MhpR. This type of dual-metabolite synergy provides great potential for a rapid modulation of gene expression and represents an important feature of transcriptional control. The <i>mhp</i> regulatory system is an example of the high complexity achievable in prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1992688931,"Violent coercive mating initiation is typical for animals with sexual conflict over mating. In these species, the coevolutionary arms-race between female defenses against coercive mating and male counter-adaptations for increased mating success leads to coevolutionary chases of male and female traits that influence the mating. It has been controversial whether one of the sexes can evolve traits that allow them to ""win"" this arms race. Here, we use morphological analysis (traditional and scanning electron micrographs), laboratory experiments and comparative methods to show how females of a species characterized by typical coercive mating initiation appear to ""win"" a particular stage of the sexual conflict by evolving morphology to hide their genitalia from direct, forceful access by males. In an apparent response to the female morphological adaptation, males of this species added to their typically violent coercive mounting of the female new post-mounting, pre-copulatory courtship signals produced by tapping the water's surface with the mid-legs. These courtship signals are intimate in the sense that they are aimed at the female, on whom the male is already mounted. Females respond to the signals by exposing their hidden genitalia for copulatory intromission. Our results indicate that the apparent victory of coevolutionary arms race by one sex in terms of morphology may trigger evolution of a behavioral phenotype in the opposite sex."
https://openalex.org/W2043742631,"Background Covalent linkage of ubiquitin regulates the function and, ultimately, the degradation of many proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Given its essential role in protein regulation, even slight perturbations in UPS activity can substantially impair cellular function. Methodology/Principal Findings We have generated and characterized a novel transgenic mouse model which expresses a previously described reporter for UPS function. This UPS reporter contains a degron sequence attached to the C-terminus of green fluorescent protein, and is predominantly expressed in neurons throughout the brain of our transgenic model. We then demonstrated that this reporter system is sensitive to UPS inhibition in vivo. Conclusions/Significance Given the obstacles associated with evaluating proteasomal function in the brain, our mouse model uniquely provides the capability to monitor UPS function in real time in individual neurons of a complex organism. Our novel mouse model now provides a useful resource with which to evaluate the impact of aging, as well as various genetic and/or pharmacological modifiers of neurodegenerative disease(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1968380589,"Natural competence is the genetically encoded ability of some bacteria to take up DNA from the environment. Although most of the incoming DNA is degraded, occasionally intact homologous fragments can recombine with the chromosome, displacing one resident strand. This potential to use DNA as a source of both nutrients and genetic novelty has important implications for the ecology and evolution of competent bacteria. However, it is not known how frequently competence changes during evolution, or whether non-competent strains can persist for long periods of time. We have previously studied competence in H. influenzae and found that both the amount of DNA taken up and the amount recombined varies extensively between different strains. In addition, several strains are unable to become competent, suggesting that competence has been lost at least once. To investigate how many times competence has increased or decreased during the divergence of these strains, we inferred the evolutionary relationships of strains using the largest datasets currently available. However, despite the use of three datasets and multiple inference methods, few nodes were resolved with high support, perhaps due to extensive mixing by recombination. Tracing the evolution of competence in those clades that were well supported identified changes in DNA uptake and/or transformation in most strains. The recency of these events suggests that competence has changed frequently during evolution but the poor support of basal relationships precludes the determination of whether non-competent strains can persist for long periods of time. In some strains, changes in transformation have occurred that cannot be due to changes in DNA uptake, suggesting that selection can act on transformation independent of DNA uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2030838075,"A hallmark of AIDS progression is a switch of cytokines from Th1 to Th2 in the plasma of patients. IL-12, a critical Th1 cytokine secreted by antigen presenting cells (APCs) is suppressed by Vpr, implicating it as an important virulence factor. We hypothesize that Vpr protein packaged in the virion may be required for disabling APCs of the first infected mucosal tissues. Consistent with this idea are reports that defects in the C-terminus of Vpr are associated with long-term non-progression.Vpr RNA amplified from various sources was electroporated into monocyte-derived DC and IL-12 levels in supernatants were analyzed. The analysis of previously reported C-terminal Vpr mutations demonstrate that they do not alleviate the block of IL-12 secretion. However, a novel single conservative amino acid substitution, R90K, reverses the IL-12 suppression. Analysis of 1226 Vpr protein sequences demonstrated arginine (R) present at position 90 in 98.8%, with other substitutions at low frequency. Furthermore, none of sequences report lysine (K) in position 90. Vpr clones harboring the reported substitutions in position 90 were studied for their ability to suppress IL-12. Our data demonstrates that none of tested substitutions other than K relieve IL-12 suppression. This suggests a natural selection for sequences which suppress IL-12 secretion by DC and against mutations which relieve such suppression. Further analyses demonstrated that the R90K, as well as deletion of the C-terminus, directs the Vpr protein for rapid degradation.This study supports Vpr as an HIV virulence factor during HIV infection and for the first time provides a link between evolutionary conservation of Vpr and its ability to suppress IL-12 secretion by DC. DC activated in the presence of Vpr would be defective in the production of IL-12, thus contributing to the prevailing Th2 cytokine profile associated with progressive HIV disease. These findings should be considered in the design of future immunotherapies that incorporate Vpr as an antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1965296201,"Background Studies of experts' problem-solving abilities have shown that experts can attend to the deep structure of a problem whereas novices attend to the surface structure. Although this effect has been replicated in many domains, there has been little investigation into such effects in medicine in general or patient management in particular. Methodology/Principal Findings We designed a 10-item forced-choice triad task in which subjects chose which one of two hypothetical patients best matched a target patient. The target and its potential matches were related in terms of surface features (e.g., two patients of a similar age and gender) and deep features (e.g., two diabetic patients with similar management strategies: a patient with arthritis and a blind patient would both have difficulty with self-injected insulin). We hypothesized that experts would have greater knowledge of management categories and would be more likely to choose deep matches. We contacted 130 novices (medical students), 11 intermediates (medical residents), and 159 experts (practicing endocrinologists) and 15, 11, and 8 subjects (respectively) completed the task. A linear mixed effects model indicated that novices were less likely to make deep matches than experts (t(68) = −3.63, p = .0006), while intermediates did not differ from experts (t(68) = −0.24, p = .81). We also found that the number of years in practice correlated with performance on diagnostic (r = .39, p = .02), but not management triads (r = .17, p = .34). Conclusions We found that experts were more likely than novices to match patients based on deep features, and that this pattern held for both diagnostic and management triads. Further, management and diagnostic triads were equally salient for expert physicians suggesting that physicians recognize and may create management-oriented categories of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2159791601,"Five percent of patients with unexplained mental retardation have been attributed to cryptic unbalanced subtelomeric rearrangements. Half of these affected individuals have inherited the rearrangement from a parent who is a carrier for a balanced translocation. However, the frequency of carriers for cryptic balanced translocations is unknown. To determine this frequency, 565 phenotypically normal unrelated individuals were examined for balanced subtelomeric rearrangements using Fluorescent In Situ hybridization (FISH) probes for all subtelomere regions. While no balanced subtelomeric rearrangements were identified, three females in this study were determined to be mosaic for the X chromosome. Mosaicism for XXX cell lines were observed in the lymphocyte cultures of 3 in 379 women (0.8%), which is a higher frequency than the 1 in 1000 (0.1%) reported for sex chromosome aneuploidies. Our findings suggest that numerical abnormalities of the X chromosome are more common in females than previously reported. Based on a review of the literature, the incidence of cryptic translocation carriers is estimated to be approximately 1/8,000, more than ten-fold higher than the frequency of visible reciprocal translocations."
