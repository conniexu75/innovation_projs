https://openalex.org/W2742763599,"Immune-checkpoint blockade is able to achieve durable responses in a subset of patients; however, we lack a satisfying comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of anti-CTLA-4- and anti-PD-1-induced tumor rejection. To address these issues, we utilized mass cytometry to comprehensively profile the effects of checkpoint blockade on tumor immune infiltrates in human melanoma and murine tumor models. These analyses reveal a spectrum of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations that are highly similar between tumor models and indicate that checkpoint blockade targets only specific subsets of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations. Anti-PD-1 predominantly induces the expansion of specific tumor-infiltrating exhausted-like CD8 T cell subsets. In contrast, anti-CTLA-4 induces the expansion of an ICOS+ Th1-like CD4 effector population in addition to engaging specific subsets of exhausted-like CD8 T cells. Thus, our findings indicate that anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint-blockade-induced immune responses are driven by distinct cellular mechanisms."

Thus, TREM2 enables microglial responses during AD by sustaining cellular energetic and biosynthetic metabolism. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of late-onset dementia. AD lesions in the CNS include plaques of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, both linked to synapse loss, neuronal death, and ultimately cognitive decline (Holtzman et al., 2011Holtzman D.M.

Rare familial AD is due to mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins (PS) that promote the generation of Aβ peptides prone to aggregation (Tanzi, 2012Tanzi R.E.

However, the risk for common late-onset AD is associated with rare variants of immune receptors expressed on microglia (Guerreiro and Hardy, 2014Guerreiro R. Hardy J.

One of these receptors, TREM2, recognizes phospholipids, apoptotic cells, and lipoproteins (Atagi et al., 2015Atagi Y. Liu C.C. Painter M.M. Chen X.F. Verbeeck C. Zheng H. Li X. Rademakers R.

TREM2 transmits intracellular signals through two adapters, DAP12 and DAP10, which recruit protein tyrosine kinase Syk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), respectively (Peng et al., 2010Peng Q.

Arginine-to-histidine variants at position 47 (R47H) or 62 (R62H) of TREM2 increase the risk for sporadic AD and impair binding to phospholipid ligands (Atagi et al., 2015Atagi Y. Liu C.C.

These variants, as well as TREM2 deficiency and haploinsufficiency in mouse models of AD, moderate microglial proliferation, survival, and accumulation around Aβ plaques, thereby facilitating Aβ plaque buildup and injury of adjacent neurons (Jay et al., 2017Jay T.R.

TREM2 has also been implicated in microglial phagocytosis of dead neurons, damaged myelin, and Aβ plaques (Neumann and Takahashi, 2007Neumann H. Takahashi K.

However, why defective TREM2 function or expression affects microglia responses to AD lesions is not known. To address this question, we first used electron and confocal microscopy to analyze microglia from 5XFAD mice, which develop Aβ accumulation that mimics AD pathology due to the expression of mutant APP and PS1 under neural-specific elements of the mouse Thy1 promoter. Microglia from 5XFAD mice lacking TREM2 had many more autophagic vesicles than did microglia in 5XFAD mice. This observation was replicated in humans, as microglia in AD patients carrying TREM2 risk variants also had more autophagic vesicles than did microglia in AD patients with the common TREM2 variant. Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway essential for cellular and energy homeostasis (Galluzzi et al., 2014Galluzzi L. Pietrocola F. Levine B. Kroemer G. Metabolic control of autophagy.Cell. 2014; 159: 1263-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). It provides a mechanism for the elimination of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles and compensates for nutrient deprivation during cell starvation through recycling of cytosolic components. Because autophagy is partially regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent pathways (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017Saxton R.A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth, metabolism, and disease.Cell. 2017; 168: 960-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3158) Google Scholar), we assessed the impact of TREM2-deficiency on mTOR activation and found that, indeed, anomalous autophagy reflected defective activation of mTOR signaling. Similarly, enhanced autophagy was observed in TREM2-deficient macrophages in vitro, which was further amplified by growth-factor limitation or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; this provided a model system for probing biochemical and metabolic pathways in microglia during Aβ accumulation. Combined metabolomics, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and system analyses of TREM2-deficient macrophages confirmed the impairment of mTOR activation, energetic pathways, ATP levels, and biosynthetic pathways. Thus, TREM2 sustains cell energetic and biosynthetic metabolism through mTOR signaling. Metabolic derailment and autophagy were offset in vitro through activation of Dectin-1, a surface receptor that triggers a signaling pathway similar to that of TREM2-DAP12 (Dambuza and Brown, 2015Dambuza I.M. Brown G.D. C-type lectins in immunity: recent developments.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2015; 32: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Metabolic abnormalities were also rescued by incubating cells with the creatine analog 1-carboxymethyl-2-iminoimidazolidine (cyclocreatine), which can passively cross membranes and, upon phosphorylation by creatine kinase, generate a supply of ATP for energy demands independent of the TREM2-mTOR axis (Kurosawa et al., 2012Kurosawa Y. Degrauw T.J. Lindquist D.M. Blanco V.M. Pyne-Geithman G.J. Daikoku T. Chambers J.B. Benoit S.C. Clark J.F. Cyclocreatine treatment improves cognition in mice with creatine transporter deficiency.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 2837-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Remarkably, dietary administration of cyclocreatine in 5XFAD mice lacking TREM2 prevented microglial autophagy, enhanced microglia numbers and clustering around Aβ plaques, and mitigated plaque-associated neurite dystrophy. This provides proof of principle that strategies aimed at sustaining basic microglial metabolism may be promising for treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglial dysfunction. To determine the impact of TREM2 deficiency on microglia function, we examined the structure of microglia from the 5XFAD mouse model of AD by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Strikingly, microglia from Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice contained abundant multivesicular/multilamellar structures suggestive of autophagosomes, which were largely absent in microglia from 5XFAD, Trem2–/–, or wild-type (WT) mice (Figures 1A and 1B). To determine whether these structures reflected ongoing autophagy in situ, we examined brain sections by confocal microscopy for the presence of LC3+ puncta, which denote autophagosomes decorated by lipidated LC3II (Klionsky et al., 2016Klionsky D.J. Abdelmohsen K. Abe A. Abedin M.J. Abeliovich H. Acevedo Arozena A. Adachi H. Adams C.M. Adams P.D. Adeli K. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition).Autophagy. 2016; 12: 1-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3992) Google Scholar). Many large LC3+ puncta were evident in microglia in Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice, whereas LC3+ puncta were sparse in microglia in WT, Trem2–/–, and 5XFAD mice (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1). These observations were translatable to human disease. We observed dramatically more LC3+ microglia in post-mortem brain sections from both R47H and R62H heterozygous AD patients than in those from case-matched AD patients homozygous for the common TREM2 variant (Figures 1E and 1F; Table S1). Taken together, these data suggest that autophagic-like vesicles accumulate in the microglia of TREM2-deficient mice and humans with TREM2 risk alleles during the development of AD.Figure S1Wider Field of View of LC3 in Microglia, Related to Figure 1Show full captionLower magnification confocal images of cortexes of WT, Trem2–/–, 5XFAD and Trem2–/–5XFAD mice.

Confocal images are representative of 3 female mice per group. To corroborate the association between TREM2 deficiency and increased autophagy, we performed biochemical analyses on sorted microglia ex vivo. The ratio of lipidated LC3II to non-lipidated LC3I was markedly higher in microglia from Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice than in microglia from 5XFAD mice, consistent with the increased number of autophagic vesicles in TREM2-deficient microglia (Figures 2A and 2B). To determine whether the increase in autophagosomes was due to activation of autophagy or blockade of lysosomal degradation, we measured protein and mRNA levels of p62, an autophagy cargo protein that is digested by lysosomal enzymes. The amount of p62 protein was lower in microglia from Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice than in microglia from 5XFAD mice. This difference was unrelated to transcription, as p62 (Sqstm1) mRNA levels were similar (Figures 2A and S2A). Thus, TREM2 deficiency results in bona fide autophagy.Figure S2TREM2 Deficiency in an AD Model Affects Microglia Expression of Genes Involved in Metabolic Pathways, and Microglia from Trem2–/– 5XFAD Mice Undergo More Cell Death, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Sqstm1 expression taken from microarrays of sorted microglia from 8 month old WT, Trem2–/–, 5XFAD and Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice.(B) Top 10 pathways in IPA analysis of differentially expressed genes from 5XFAD and Trem2–/– 5XFAD microglia.

Error bar represents mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗p < 0.005 by One-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test (I). Why is autophagic flux amplified in 5XFAD mice lacking TREM2? Autophagy often reflects an adaptive response to stress that can occur when cells cannot satisfy increased demands for energy and protein synthesis (Kroemer et al., 2010Kroemer G. Mariño G. Levine B. Autophagy and the integrated stress response.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar). Because the serine/threonine kinase target of rapamycin (mTOR) has a crucial role in stimulating both energetic and anabolic metabolism, cell growth, and proliferation (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6166) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the autophagy observed in microglia in Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice might result from a defect in mTOR signaling. mTOR signals through two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Immunoblotting of sorted microglia from Trem2–/– 5XFAD and 5XFAD mice revealed decreased phosphorylation of 4EBP1, an mTORC1 effector, as well as Akt (serine 473) and NDRG1, both mTORC2 effectors, in the TREM2-deficient microglia (Figure 2A). Ulk1, a key inducer of autophagy, which is inhibited by mTOR signaling through phosphorylation at serine 757 (Kim et al., 2011Kim J. Kundu M. Viollet B. Guan K.L. AMPK and mTOR regulate autophagy through direct phosphorylation of Ulk1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (4556) Google Scholar), was less phosphorylated in microglia from Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice, consistent with reduced mTOR activation and increased autophagy (Figure 2A). Impaired mTOR signaling was associated with phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of low energy states (Figure 2A). Providing further evidence for defective energetic and anabolic metabolism associated with TREM2 deficiency, microglia from Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice had a lower mitochondrial mass than microglia from 5XFAD mice (Figures 2C and 2D). Furthermore, gene expression microarray analyses of sorted microglia from Trem2–/– 5XFAD and 5XFAD mice revealed that TREM2 deficiency was associated with decreased expression of genes encoding translation initiation factors, ribosomal proteins, glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, as well as the transcription factor HIF1α that controls glycolysis (Figures S2B–S2G). Taken together, these data demonstrate that during the development of AD, TREM2 deficiency derails the mTOR pathway, anabolic and energetic metabolism in microglia, which induces compensatory autophagy in both mice and humans. To determine whether autophagy in TREM2-deficient microglia can effectively compensate for the metabolic defects in vivo and prevent apoptosis, we examined brain sections by confocal microscopy for the presence of cleaved caspase-3, an indicator of apoptosis. We found that cleaved caspase-3 was much more abundant in microglia in Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice than in microglia in 5XFAD mice (Figures 2E and 2F). Additionally, the percentage of microglia with colocalization of cleaved caspase-3 and LC3+ puncta was higher in Trem2–/– 5XFAD mice than in 5XFAD mice (Figures S2H and S2I). Thus, autophagy may not be sufficient to sustain the microglial response to stress, at least at the late time point of disease progression analyzed. We then asked whether TREM2-deficiency could derail mTOR signaling in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro. To mimic the metabolic stress that occurs during disease, we used growth-factor deprivation. BMDMs were cultured overnight in concentrations of CSF1-containing L cell-conditioned medium (LCCM) ranging from optimal to limiting (10% to 0.5%). Trem2–/– BMDMs contained more autophagic vesicles (Figures 3A and 3B) and had a higher LC3II/LC3I ratio than WT cells when CSF1 was limiting (Figure 3C). Addition of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin greatly increased LC3II in Trem2–/– BMDMs, confirming that the increase in autophagosomes was due to increased autophagic flux rather than reduced autophagosome degradation (Figures 3D and 3E). As observed in sorted microglia, autophagy in BMDMs was linked to impaired mTOR signaling. Trem2–/– BMDMs had less phosphorylated 4EBP1, Akt (serine 473), and NDRG1 (Figure 3F) and more phosphorylated AMPK (Figure 3G) in both optimal CSF1 and limiting CSF1 than did WT BMDMs. In limiting CSF1, Trem2–/– BMDMs had decreased inhibitory phosphorylation of Ulk1 at serine 757, while activating phosphorylation of Ulk1 at serine 317 increased (Figure 3H). Thus, lack of TREM2 suppressed mTOR activation and elicited compensatory AMPK and Ulk1 activation and autophagy in BMDMs in response to metabolic stress, very similar to our observations of microglia in 5XFAD mice. As TREM2 signaling adapters DAP12 and DAP10 have been shown to activate PI3-K, which in turn can activate mTOR, we asked whether enhanced mTOR signaling in WT BMDM compared to Trem2–/– BMDM was dependent on PI3-K. Inhibition of PI3-K with Wortmannin or LY294002 caused a major reduction in phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream targets in WT BMDMs; the residual amount of phosphorylation was similar to that seen in Trem2–/– BMDMs (Figures 3I and S3A). In addition to limiting CSF1, other stressors may differentially modulate mTOR signaling and autophagy in WT and Trem2–/– BMDMs. Treatment with tunicamycin, which provokes ER stress, unfolded protein response, and autophagy, induced greater LC3II/LC3I ratios and less phosphorylated Akt (serine 473) in Trem2–/– BMDMs than in WT BMDMs (Figures 3J and 3K). Thus, TREM2 deficiency affects cell responses to multiple stressors. TREM2 signaling may not just have a more pronounced effect on cells under stress conditions, but may actually increase under such conditions. When cultured in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), TREM2 reporter cells, which express GFP upon TREM2 engagement (Wang et al., 2015Wang Y. Cella M. Mallinson K. Ulrich J.D. Young K.L. Robinette M.L. Gilfillan S. Krishnan G.M. Sudhakar S. Zinselmeyer B.H. et al.TREM2 lipid sensing sustains the microglial response in an Alzheimer’s disease model.Cell. 2015; 160: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), showed some activation (Figure S3B). However, upon serum starvation, a significantly higher proportion of reporter cells became activated, possibly due to exposure of the TREM2 ligand phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of stressed cells. This activation could be blocked by inclusion of an anti-TREM2 antibody. Thus, in multiple in vitro settings of stress, TREM2-expressing cells are more able to sustain mTOR activation and suppress autophagy in a PI3-K-dependent manner than are cells lacking TREM2. To directly demonstrate the impact of TREM2 deficiency on energetic and anabolic pathways in BMDMs, we performed mass spectrometry to quantify cellular metabolites and RNA-seq to quantify mRNA levels of metabolic enzymes. Analysis of metabolite data alone, or in combination with RNA-seq data by a systems-based algorithm (Sergushichev et al., 2016Sergushichev A.A. Loboda A.A. Jha A.K. Vincent E.E. Driggers E.M. Jones R.G. Pearce E.J. Artyomov M.N. GAM: a web-service for integrated transcriptional and metabolic network analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: W194-W200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), revealed widespread differences between WT and Trem2–/– BMDMs in various metabolic pathways. Compared to WT BMDMs in optimal CSF1, Trem2–/– BMDMs cultured under the same conditions exhibited (1) a marked decrease of key intermediates in the synthesis of nucleotides (e.g., phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate), N-glycosylated proteins (e.g., UDP-glucose), and phospholipids (e.g., CDP-ethanolamine); (2) a decrease in glycolytic metabolites (e.g., glucose 6-phosphate and fructose bisphosphate) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (citrate and succinate); and (3) an increase in catabolic products of amino acids (e.g., indolacetate) and phospholipids (e.g., glycerol 3-phosphate) (Figures 4A and S4A). Moreover, a selective increase in malate and fumarate suggested an enhanced malate-aspartate shuttle to sustain defective NADH oxidation and NAD regeneration (Figure 4A).

We analyzed deep-coverage, targeted, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of paired tumor and blood samples from 8,810 individuals to assess the frequency and clinical relevance of CH in patients with non-hematologic malignancies. We identified CH in 25% of cancer patients, with 4.5% harboring presumptive leukemia driver mutations (CH-PD). CH was associated with increased age, prior radiation therapy, and tobacco use. PPM1D and TP53 mutations were associated with prior exposure to chemotherapy. CH and CH-PD led to an increased incidence of subsequent hematologic cancers, and CH-PD was associated with shorter patient survival. These data suggest that CH occurs in an age-dependent manner and that specific perturbations can enhance fitness of clonal hematopoietic stem cells, which can impact outcome through progression to hematologic malignancies and through cell-non-autonomous effects on solid tumor biology."

Our findings connect DNA replication to R-loop homeostasis and suggest a mechanistic basis for genome instability resulting from deregulated DNA replication, observed in cancer and other disease states. During DNA synthesis, the replication machinery must overcome numerous obstacles, including tightly bound DNA-protein complexes, non-B-form DNA structures, and lesions that interfere with fork progression (Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007Mirkin E.V. Mirkin S.M. Replication fork stalling at natural impediments.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 13-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Failure to overcome these barriers leads to genome instability, a hallmark of cancer and aging (Gaillard et al., 2015Gaillard H. García-Muse T. Aguilera A. Replication stress and cancer.Nat. Rev.

Transcription complexes are one endogenous impediment frequently encountered by replication forks, and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) can induce DNA replication-fork stalling, DNA recombination, DNA breaks and mutations (Dutta et al., 2011Dutta D.

MacAlpine D.M. Wang J.D. Co-orientation of replication and transcription preserves genome integrity.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1000810Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, TRCs pose a potent threat to genome stability (García-Muse and Aguilera, 2016García-Muse T. Aguilera A. Transcription-replication conflicts: how they occur and how they are resolved.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). TRCs occur in two orientations: co-directional (CD), where the replication fork moves in the same direction as the transcription machinery, and head-on (HO), where the two converge. In bacteria, HO collisions are the main cause of genomic alterations, leading to deletions, recombination, and cell death (Srivatsan et al., 2010Srivatsan A. Tehranchi A. MacAlpine D.M. Wang J.D. Co-orientation of replication and transcription preserves genome integrity.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1000810Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Vilette et al., 1996Vilette D. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Transcription-induced deletions in plasmid vectors: M13 DNA replication as a source of instability.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To minimize HO-TRCs, bacterial genomes are organized to preferentially co-orient essential and highly transcribed genes with replication (Rocha, 2008Rocha E.P. Evolutionary patterns in prokaryotic genomes.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although HO collisions are thought to be more deleterious, this orientation bias necessarily favors CD encounters, which can disrupt replication at specific sites, such as at the highly transcribed ribosomal DNA clusters (Merrikh et al., 2011Merrikh H. Machón C. Grainger W.H. Grossman A.D. Soultanas P. Co-directional replication-transcription conflicts lead to replication restart.Nature. 2011; 470: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). They can also form double-strand breaks (DSBs) when the replication fork encounters a stable backtracked RNA polymerase (RNAP) (Dutta et al., 2011Dutta D. Shatalin K. Epshtein V. Gottesman M.E. Nudler E. Linking RNA polymerase backtracking to genome instability in E. coli.Cell. 2011; 146: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although there is less direct evidence, TRCs are proposed to be a potent threat to genome stability in eukaryotic cells. RNAP II transcribed genes can induce recombination on yeast plasmid constructs when transcription and replication are oriented in opposite directions (Prado and Aguilera, 2005Prado F. Aguilera A. Impairment of replication fork progression mediates RNA polII transcription-associated recombination.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene expression in mammalian cells can provoke S-phase-dependent recombination (Gottipati et al., 2008Gottipati P. Cassel T.N. Savolainen L. Helleday T. Transcription-associated recombination is dependent on replication in Mammalian cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and torsional stress created by Topoisomerase I depletion leads to stalled forks and DNA breaks at certain S-phase transcribed genes (Tuduri et al., 2009Tuduri S. Crabbé L. Conti C. Tourrière H. Holtgreve-Grez H. Jauch A. Pantesco V. De Vos J. Thomas A. Theillet C. et al.Topoisomerase I suppresses genomic instability by preventing interference between replication and transcription.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Collisions in long genes may be particularly difficult to avoid, as they complete transcription over multiple cell cycles (Helmrich et al., 2011Helmrich A. Ballarino M. Tora L. Collisions between replication and transcription complexes cause common fragile site instability at the longest human genes.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 966-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Moreover, some long genes overlap with hotspots for chromosomal instability that replicate late in S phase (Le Tallec et al., 2014Le Tallec B. Koundrioukoff S. Wilhelm T. Letessier A. Brison O. Debatisse M. Updating the mechanisms of common fragile site instability: how to reconcile the different views?.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71: 4489-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Early replicating fragile sites lie at clusters of highly transcribed genes near early origins. Thus, their fragility may also be driven by transcription-replication encounters (Barlow et al., 2013Barlow J.H. Faryabi R.B. Callén E. Wong N. Malhowski A. Chen H.T. Gutierrez-Cruz G. Sun H.-W.W. McKinnon P. Wright G. et al.Identification of early replicating fragile sites that contribute to genome instability.Cell. 2013; 152: 620-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that conflicts between transcription and replication frequently threaten genome integrity in eukaryotic cells. One potent co-transcriptional replication fork barrier is the R-loop, an RNA-DNA hybrid formed when nascent transcripts reanneal to their template DNA, displacing the non-template strand as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012Aguilera A. García-Muse T. R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Elevated R-loop levels cause DNA damage and genome instability. The loss of RNA processing and regulatory factors increases R-loop levels, causing R-loop-dependent DNA damage in both yeast and human cells (Huertas and Aguilera, 2003Huertas P. Aguilera A.

R-loops are also prevalent in eukaryotic genomes and are involved in immunoglobulin class switch recombination (Yu et al., 2003Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C.-L.L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. R-loops at immunoglobulin class switch regions in the chromosomes of stimulated B cells.Nat.

R-loop stabilization represses antisense transcription at the Arabidopsis FLC locus.Science. 2013; 340: 619-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). DNA replication contributes to R-loop-induced DNA damage, consistent with R-loops potentially blocking replication forks (Castellano-Pozo et al., 2012Castellano-Pozo M. García-Muse T. Aguilera A.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). What happens when replication forks encounter R-loop-associated transcription complexes is unclear. Whether these R-loops are traversed or removed, how collision orientation affects R-loop stability, and what molecular intermediates may underlie the observed DNA damage are unresolved questions. The plasticity of eukaryotic replication programs makes it difficult to study how R-loops and transcription orientation impact TRCs. Unlike in bacteria, where a single origin replicates each gene in a predictable orientation, mammalian chromosomes contain numerous origins that fire with variable efficiencies and timing (Hills and Diffley, 2014Hills S.A. Diffley J.F. DNA replication and oncogene-induced replicative stress.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: R435-R444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, Rhind and Gilbert, 2013Rhind N. Gilbert D.M. DNA replication timing.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a010132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Moreover, eukaryotic cells have excess origins that can complete DNA synthesis when other replication forks stall (Alver et al., 2014Alver R.C. Chadha G.S. Blow J.J. The contribution of dormant origins to genome stability: from cell biology to human genetics.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2014; 19: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it is difficult to predict the location and orientation of a TRC in eukaryotic cells. Here, we report a human-cell-based plasmid system with exquisite control over the direction and timing of replication, transcription, and R-loop formation. We find striking differences between HO and CD collisions in the context with an R-loop. These collisions induce distinct DNA damage responses (DDRs) and differentially affect hybrid stability, reducing hybrids in the CD orientation but promoting them in the HO orientation. Importantly, we demonstrate the same effects on hybrids in the native genomic context. These observations suggest that the replisome regulates R-loop levels and provide mechanistic insight into how regulatory R-loops are tolerated in S phase. They also indicate that deregulated replication may perturb R-loop levels, which may underlie genomic instability in cells experiencing replication stress, a hallmark of cancer and other disease states (Gaillard et al., 2015Gaillard H. García-Muse T. Aguilera A. Replication stress and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, Vijg and Suh, 2013Vijg J. Suh Y.

Causes and consequences of replication stress.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). To systematically probe the consequences of TRCs, we developed an episomal system to induce localized conflicts with controlled transcription levels. We took advantage of the Epstein–Barr virus replication origin (oriP), which allows for unidirectional replication of chromatinized plasmids (Kirchmaier and Sugden, 1995Kirchmaier A.L. Sugden B. Plasmid maintenance of derivatives of oriP of Epstein-Barr virus.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1280-1283PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). The co-expressed Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein uses the endogenous MCM (minichromosome maintenance) helicase and other endogenous replication factors, while also binding the oriP site to block one arm of the bidirectional replication fork (Dhar et al., 2001Dhar S.K. Yoshida K. Machida Y. Khaira P. Chaudhuri B. Wohlschlegel J.A. Leffak M. Yates J. Dutta A.

The Epstein-Barr virus origin of plasmid replication, oriP, contains both the initiation and termination sites of DNA replication.Cell. 1989; 58: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We cloned the R-loop-forming portion of the mouse AIRN (mAIRN) gene (Ginno et al., 2012Ginno P.A. Lott P.L. Christensen H.C. Korf I. Chédin F. R-loop formation is a distinctive characteristic of unmethylated human CpG island promoters.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 814-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) or the non R-loop-forming ECFP sequence in both directions relative to oriP to compare R-loop-dependent (mAIRN) and R-loop-independent (ECFP) HO and CD collisions (Figure 1A). Replication-independent R-loop formation was analyzed at both sequences by in vitro transcription of bacterial plasmid templates. Stable R-loops induce a topological change that reduces mobility in native agarose gel electrophoresis (Ginno et al., 2012Ginno P.A. Lott P.L. Christensen H.C. Korf I. Chédin F. R-loop formation is a distinctive characteristic of unmethylated human CpG island promoters.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 814-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). As expected, mAIRN but not ECFP transcription resulted in RNase H-sensitive R-loop formation in vitro (Figure 1B). We next introduced these constructs into human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells expressing the tetracycline (Tet)-regulated transactivator to control transcription of the mAIRN and ECFP sequences with doxycycline (DOX). We generated stable cell lines maintaining 10–150 plasmid copies per cell with >90% efficiency per generation (Figures S1A–S1C), a rate of plasmid loss consistent with other oriP/EBNA1-based vectors (Leight and Sugden, 2001Leight E.R. Sugden B. Establishment of an oriP replicon is dependent upon an infrequent, epigenetic event.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4149-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed dose-dependent transcriptional activation of Tet-ON-controlled sequences in all cell lines (Figures 1C and S1D–S1G). Interestingly, transcription through both sequences was reduced in the HO orientation compared to the CD orientation, suggesting HO conflicts inhibit RNAP II transcription. Independent of orientation, transcription was significantly higher in ECFP sequences than the R-loop-forming mAIRN sequences (Figures 1C and S1D–S1G). This could be caused by differences in mRNA turnover or R-loop formation. To determine whether transcription induces R-loop formation on the mAIRN sequence in cells, we performed DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation (DRIP) and qPCR on the plasmid using the RNA-DNA hybrid-specific S9.6 antibody (Boguslawski et al., 1986Boguslawski S.J. Smith D.E. Michalak M.A. Mickelson K.E. Yehle C.O. Patterson W.L. Carrico R.J. Characterization of monoclonal antibody to DNA.RNA and its application to immunodetection of hybrids.J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The mAIRN HO cells exhibited robust RNase H-sensitive RNA-DNA hybrid formation upon DOX addition (Figure 1D, mAIRN HO). Surprisingly, RNA-DNA hybrids were poorly induced in the mAIRN CD cells (Figure 1D). Hybrids also formed predominantly on the mAIRN transcription unit on both constructs, with upstream and downstream regions showing only minor hybrid induction (Figures S1H and S1I). Thus, RNA-DNA hybrids were specifically enriched on the mAIRN HO transcription unit, despite the same promoter driving transcription of the same sequence in mAIRN CD cells. This finding suggests that the orientation with which a replication fork approaches the mAIRN transcription unit critically affects hybrid formation or hybrid stability on the plasmid. To further test our hypothesis that DNA replication alters RNA-DNA hybrid dynamics, we synchronized cells with a single thymidine block and compared hybrid levels in asynchronous and G1/S arrested cells (Figure 2A). If the observed difference in hybrid levels depends on replication, we reasoned arresting cells at the G1/S transition should alleviate the difference. We confirmed successful arrest and transcriptional induction by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR (Figures S2A–S2C). As previously noted, hybrid levels were greater on the mAIRN HO plasmid than the mAIRN CD plasmid in asynchronous cells (Figure 2B, ASYN). G1/S arrest reduced hybrids on the HO plasmid and increased hybrids on the CD plasmid. Strikingly, this block to replication completely neutralized the orientation-dependent difference in hybrid levels (Figure 2B, G1/S).Figure S2Flow Cytometry and qRT-PCR Analyses after Synchronization of mAIRN HO and CD Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Representative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) profiles of mAIRN HO and CD cells treated with 0 or 1000 ng/mL DOX under asynchronous conditions (ASYN), after treatment with 2mM thymidine for 19h (G1/S) or subsequent wash-out with fresh medium for 3h, 6h, 9h and 12h.

RNA samples were extracted and gene expression was normalized relative to the expression of the β-actin gene. The bars indicate mean and standard deviations between biological replicates (n = 3). We then monitored hybrid levels at different times after release from the thymidine block (Figure 2C). There was no difference in hybrid levels early (3 hr) after release, consistent with replication of the oriP/EBNA1 origin in mid to late S phase (Zhou et al., 2009Zhou J. Snyder A.R. Lieberman P.M. Epstein-Barr virus episome stability is coupled to a delay in replication timing.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 2154-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A small but significant enrichment of hybrids was detected on the mAIRN HO construct at 6 hr. At 9 hr, hybrid levels further increased in the HO orientation and decreased in the CD orientation. Notably, hybrids returned to pre-replicative levels after 12 hr when most cells finished DNA replication (Figures 2D, S2A and S2B). These observations strongly suggest replication-fork progression increases co-transcriptional hybrid levels in the HO orientation but decreases hybrid levels in the CD orientation. Thus, we conclude that the replisome is an orientation-dependent regulator of RNA-DNA hybrids in our episomal system. R-loops may accumulate in the HO orientation if the replication fork stalls at the RNA-DNA hybrid containing RNAP complex and fails to complete plasmid replication. We thus monitored interactions between the transcription and replication machineries using the proximity ligation assay (PLA). Antibodies against RNAP II and PCNA were used to mark transcription complexes and replication forks, respectively (Figure 2E). In pre-extracted mAIRN HO cells, the fraction of cells containing ≥3 PLA foci (RNAP II and PCNA interaction) increased approximately 4-fold upon DOX induction. Strikingly, no change was detected in the CD orientation (Figure 2F). This finding suggests that persistent collisions arise from HO but not CD TRCs. To test the generality of our conclusions from the plasmid system, we asked whether TRC orientation modulates RNA-DNA hybrid levels around replication origins in the native genomic context. To do so, we performed DRIP with next-generation sequencing (DRIP-seq) to map R-loops genome-wide in unperturbed HeLa cells. We observed 15,833 DRIP peaks primarily in genic regions (Figures S3A and S3B) and confirmed enrichment at some of these sites by qPCR (Figure S3C). These data are in line with previous DRIP-seq experiments performed in Ntera2 cells, although HeLa cells showed noticeably more DRIP peaks in intergenic areas (27.3%) than Ntera2 cells (8.3%) (Sanz et al., 2016Sanz L.A.

R-loops were enriched at promoters and terminators (Figure S3D), consistent with their roles in promoter methylation and transcription termination (Ginno et al., 2012Ginno P.A. Lott P.L.

R-loops induce repressive chromatin marks over mammalian gene terminators.Nature. 2014; 516: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We also observed significant overlap between DRIP peaks and regions of GC skew, consistent with this strand asymmetry driving R-loop formation (Ginno et al., 2013Ginno P.A. Lim Y.W. Lott P.L. Korf I. Chédin F. GC skew at the 5′ and 3′ ends of human genes links R-loop formation to epigenetic regulation and transcription termination.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 1590-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Figure S3E). Next, we used published Okazaki fragment sequencing (OK-seq) data from HeLa cells to map active replication origins (Petryk et al., 2016Petryk N. Kahli M. d’Aubenton-Carafa Y. Jaszczyszyn Y. Shen Y. Silvain M. Thermes C. Chen C.-L.L. Hyrien O. Replication landscape of the human genome.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 10208Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We focused on origins in expressed genes defined by an existing Global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) dataset from the same cell line (Andersson et al., 2014Andersson R. Refsing Andersen P. Valen E. Core L.J. Bornholdt J. Boyd M. Heick Jensen T. Sandelin A. Nuclear stability and transcriptional directionality separate functionally distinct RNA species.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Transcription through genes is predominantly unidirectional, but replication origins initiate bi-directionally. Thus, each genic origin has the potential for both an HO and a CD collision. This arrangement provides a powerful natural experiment to test how collision orientation affects RNA-DNA hybrid levels by measuring DRIP-seq signal around each origin. RNA-DNA hybrids tend to be high at promoters and gene terminators (Sanz et al., 2016Sanz L.A. Hartono S.R. Lim Y.W. Steyaert S. Rajpurkar A. Ginno P.A. Xu X. Chédin F.

Thus, we excluded origins where the edge of a 24 kb window lay within 5 kb of these regulatory regions, ensuring each collision pair occurred within homogeneous regions of the same gene body. 2,169 origins within 1,259 genes met these criteria, showing the expected change of replication-fork directionality (RFD) and uniform transcription directionality across the 24 kb windows (Figure 3B; Table S3). Strikingly, DRIP-seq signal around these 2,169 origins was"

Our findings indicate that the clock operates at the crossroad between protein acetylation, liver metabolism, and aging. It is commonly assumed that interplay exists between the circadian clock and the aging process and, more specifically, that changes in central rhythmic behavior are associated with age-dependent decline (Kondratova and Kondratov, 2012Kondratova A.A. Kondratov R.V. The circadian clock and pathology of the ageing brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In addition to a largely heterogeneous and anecdotal literature, it has been shown that neuronal activity rhythms display an age-dependent degradation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Nakamura et al., 2011Nakamura T.J. Nakamura W. Yamazaki S. Kudo T. Cutler T. Colwell C.S. Block G.D. Age-related decline in circadian output.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 10201-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which houses the central circadian pacemaker. This age-dependent decline in the central clock disrupts the physiological ability of mice to entrain to external light cues and has been reported to alter rhythmic behavior (Chang and Guarente, 2013Chang H.C.

Aging differentially affects the re-entrainment response of central and peripheral circadian oscillators.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 16193-16202Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a genetic mouse model has shown that deficiency in the core circadian transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear-translocator-like (ARNTL or BMAL1) results in reduced lifespan and premature aging phenotype in mice (Kondratov et al., 2006Kondratov R.V. Kondratova A.A. Gorbacheva V.Y. Vykhovanets O.V. Antoch M.P.

Yet, how aging influences the metabolic functions of peripheral clocks remains virtually unexplored. Several hallmarks of aging-associated deterioration are linked to disruption of metabolic homeostasis, including deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, reprogramming of cellular signaling pathways, and insulin-resistance (Cartee et al., 2016Cartee G.D.

Importantly, the potential of the circadian clock to be reprogrammed by nutritional challenges has revealed its intrinsic plasticity (Eckel-Mahan et al., 2013Eckel-Mahan K.L. Patel V.R. de Mateo S.

To unravel the molecular and metabolic pathways that underlie the interplay between circadian rhythms and aging, we have compared young versus old mice, fed ad libitum with either normal chow or under CR, and paralleled the high-throughput transcriptomic analyses of liver versus muscle and epidermal stem cells. Our findings reveal that aging operates by reprogramming the circadian transcriptome. We show that these age-dependent changes in circadian gene expression occur in a highly tissue-specific manner, as demonstrated by a comparative analysis of the liver transcriptional landscape versus epidermal and skeletal muscle stem cells (see accompanying study in this issue [Solanas et al., 2017Solanas G. Oliveira Peixoto F. Perdiguero E. Jardí M. Ruiz-Bonilla V. Datta D. Symeonidi A. Castellanos A. Welz P. Martín Caballero J. et al.Adult stem cells undergo circadian reprogramming during ageing.Cell. 2017; 170 (this issue): 678-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar]). Our analysis of the circadian hepatic transcriptome revealed enriched biological pathways centered on protein acetylation and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism, thus prompting subsequent examination. Strikingly, global protein acetylation was found to be highly circadian and this rhythmicity was dampened in aged mice. Also, CR resulted in a dramatic rescue of protein acetylation over the day/night cycle. Comparing the CR-dependent circadian transcriptome with our published SIRT1-dependent transcriptome (Masri et al., 2014Masri S. Rigor P. Cervantes M. Ceglia N. Sebastian C. Xiao C. Roqueta-Rivera M. Deng C. Osborne T.F. Mostoslavsky R. et al.Partitioning circadian transcription by SIRT6 leads to segregated control of cellular metabolism.Cell. 2014; 158: 659-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we identified an overlapping gene expression signature that linked SIRT1 with CR-mediated effects on circadian reprogramming in the liver. Further analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that CR regulates NAD+/SIRT1, which modulates the circadian acetylation of acetyl-CoA synthetase (AceCS1), a pathway known to control rhythmic nucleocytoplasmic acetyl-CoA production (Hallows et al., 2006Hallows W.C.

These findings reveal age-dependent metabolic changes in the circadian hepatic transcriptome in young and old mice and link CR-dependent reorganization of circadian metabolism in the liver with NAD+ availability, SIRT1 activity, and global protein acetylation over the circadian cycle. To determine how the hepatic clock regulates rhythmic metabolism during aging, young and old mice were subjected to a 30% calorie reduction or a normal chow feeding for 6 months (see STAR Methods). Mice were sacrificed every 4 hr over the circadian cycle and hepatic transcriptomic analysis was performed. Venn diagrams and heatmaps display circadian genes selected using the nonparametric algorithm JTK_cycle (Hughes et al., 2010Hughes M.E. Hogenesch J.B. Kornacker K. JTK_CYCLE: an efficient nonparametric algorithm for detecting rhythmic components in genome-scale data sets.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2010; 25: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and a p value cutoff of 0.01 in young normal diet (YND) and old normal diet (OND) fed mice. Transcriptomics revealed 2,626 genes (44.8%) exclusively oscillatory in YND and 1,664 (28.4%) genes were only rhythmic in OND groups, while 1,575 genes (26.9%) were circadian in both groups (Figure 1A). Comparison of the amplitude of hepatic oscillatory genes in YND versus OND is shown in Figure 1B. Heatmaps display circadian genes found exclusively in YND (left panel) versus OND (right panel) (Figure 1C), and common rhythmic genes (Figure S1A). The expression of core clock genes enriched in both YND and OND was confirmed. The expression of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (CCGs) as well as the expression of core clock proteins is virtually unaltered when comparing young and old animals fed a normal diet (Figures 1D, and S2A and S2D ).Figure S1Heatmaps and Gene Ontology Analysis of Common Circadian Genes from the Hepatic Transcriptome, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full captionHeatmaps display common circadian genes in YND versus OND (A), YND versus YCR (B), and OND versus OCR (C).

To determine if CR can reorganize circadian gene expression in the liver, CR was applied to young (YCR) and old (OCR) mice and the circadian hepatic transcriptomes were compared to young and old mice fed a normal diet. Transcriptomic analysis identified 1,867 genes (22.6%) in YND and 4,070 genes (49.2%) in YCR to be circadian based on a 0.01 p value cutoff criteria, and 2334 genes (28.2%) were found to be commonly rhythmic in both groups (Figure 1E). The amplitude of hepatic rhythmic genes is enhanced in YCR mice, as compared to YND (Figure 1F). Heatmaps display circadian genes found exclusively in YND (left panel) versus YCR (right panel) (Figure 1G), as well as common circadian genes (Figure S1B). Though core clock and CCGs expression profiles are rhythmic in both YND and YCR groups, CR enhances the expression of clock genes (Figures 1H and S2B). The dynamic response in oscillating genes found in YCR demonstrates the sensitivity of the circadian hepatic clock to macronutrient limitation. Similarly, old mice were subjected to CR and transcriptomic analysis was performed. 1,722 genes (24.8%) were found to be circadian in OND, 3,715 genes (53.4%) were oscillatory in OCR group, and 1,517 genes (21.8%) were commonly rhythmic in both groups (Figure 1I). Similar to YCR, the amplitude of hepatic rhythmic genes is enhanced in OCR mice, as compared to OND (Figure 1J). Heatmaps display circadian genes found exclusively in OND (left panel) versus OCR (right panel) (Figure 1K), as well as common circadian genes (Figure S1C). A significant increase in core clock and CCGs expression profiles was found in OCR versus OND fed mice (Figures 1L and S2C). Overall, the effect of CR in both young and old mice is evident as a significant portion of the circadian hepatic genome is rhythmic in response to nutrient deprivation. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the oscillatory transcriptome shows that sterol metabolic process, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and glycerolipid metabolism are highly enriched In the YND group (Figure 2A). Both YND and OND categories are enriched in histone/chromatin modifications, while OND is specifically enriched in protein deubiquitination and cell-cycle G1/S transition biological pathways (Figure 2A). Moreover, as compared to YND, the YCR transcriptome shows highly significant biological function enrichment in genes involved in RNA processing, chromatin modification, and peptidyl-lysine modification (Figure 2B). Similar to the YCR group, GO pathway analysis does reveal that the OCR category of genes is highly enriched in chromatin modification, RNA processing, autophagy and ribosome biogenesis (Figure 2C). Common genes in YND, OND, YCR, and OCR groups contain an enrichment in circadian regulation of gene expression and NAD+ metabolism or biosynthesis (Figure S1D–S1F). Moreover, a comparison between the YCR and OCR groups revealed a 45.8% overlap of 3,653 common genes among these two categories (Figure S3), including consistence in the expression of core clock gene between YCR and OCR groups (Figure S3E).Figure S3Comparison of the Circadian Hepatic Transcriptome between YCR and OCR, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Venn diagram displays the total number (top) and ratio (bottom) of rhythmic genes in the liver from YCR (purple, n = 5 and 6 per time point) and OCR (blue, n = 3-5 per time point), including common genes.

The circadian hepatic transcriptome and resulting GO analysis reveal a large set of genes with dampened oscillation by aging, whereas some genes gain oscillation by CR (Figures S2E–S2G). Remarkably, circadian genes involved in RNA processing and autophagy are highly enriched both in YCR and OCR groups (Figure 2B and 2C, and Data S1). Therefore, the question arises: does CR reorganize the circadian transcriptome in the liver? We compared the circadian transcriptome between YND and OCR revealing only 24% overlap of 1,824 common genes in the liver (Figure S4). However, GO analysis uncovered that some of the circadian biological signatures of CR such as autophagy, RNA processing, and target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling are identified within “common” circadian signatures between YND and OCR (Figure S4D). These observations show that CR reprograms the circadian hepatic transcriptome. Additionally, the hepatic transcriptome was analyzed for phase of circadian gene expression, revealing that two sets of circadian genes peaking around zeitgeber time (ZT) 0-6 (phase 1) and ZT 12-18 (phase 2) in both YND and OND liver (Figure 3A). Interestingly, new peaks in phase of gene expression are evident in YCR and OCR groups, which is likely reflective of feeding anticipatory behavior in calorically restricted mice (Figure 3A). In support of this notion, the phase of circadian genes is indeed advanced by CR (Figure 3B). Comparative analysis of phase 3 (ZT 8-16) rhythmic genes of YCR/OCR shows they are enriched in phase 2 (ZT12-18) of YND/OND and advanced in ZT (Figure 3B). Similarly, circadian genes of YCR/OCR at phase 4 (ZT 20-2) are enriched in phase 1 (ZT 0-6) of YND/OND (Figure 3B). These data indicate that CR functions to broaden the phase of circadian gene expression over the day/night cycle. In addition to liver, epidermal (EpSCs) and skeletal muscle stem cells (MsSCs) were harvested from young and old mice fed normal diet or CR (see accompanying study in this issue [Solanas et al., 2017Solanas G. Oliveira Peixoto F. Perdiguero E. Jardí M. Ruiz-Bonilla V. Datta D. Symeonidi A. Castellanos A. Welz P. Martín Caballero J. et al.Adult stem cells undergo circadian reprogramming during ageing.Cell. 2017; 170 (this issue): 678-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar]). Tissue-specific comparison of phase of gene expression was performed using genes selected to be circadian by JTK_cycle (p value cutoff of 0.01). Remarkably, similar phase profiles were observed in MsSCs and liver, likely reflective of the metabolic and nutrient responsive nature of these cells (Figure 3C). Also, EpSCs were altered in phase of gene expression in old mice, but in mice subjected to CR this phase was reverted to a “young” profile, consisting of two sets of genes peaking in the day and the night, respectively (Figure 3C). The phase profiles suggest that mice fed a CR diet display a reorganization of the transcriptome, and this phase distribution is reflective of tissue-specific function. To further compare the tissue-specific circadian signature, we carried out GO analysis. The Venn diagram reveals overlapping genes among the three cell types, including 74 genes in common that comprise the tissue-independent circadian genes in liver, EpSCs and MsSCs from YND mice (Figure 4A). The EpSCs transcriptome from YND mice reveals a highly significant enrichment in genes involved in response to DNA damage, DNA replication, and DNA repair as well as skin epidermal development (data shown in accompanying study [Solanas et al., 2017Solanas G. Oliveira Peixoto F. Perdiguero E. Jardí M. Ruiz-Bonilla V. Datta D. Symeonidi A. Castellanos A. Welz P.

Similarly, MsSCs from YND mice display a unique biological function signature that involves genes implicated in skeletal muscle development, glucose homeostasis, and response to insulin (see accompanying study [Solanas et al., 2017Solanas G.

https://openalex.org/W2745773403,"Chromosome conformation is an important feature of metazoan gene regulation; however, enhancer-promoter contact remodeling during cellular differentiation remains poorly understood. To address this, genome-wide promoter capture Hi-C (CHi-C) was performed during epidermal differentiation. Two classes of enhancer-promoter contacts associated with differentiation-induced genes were identified. The first class ('gained') increased in contact strength during differentiation in concert with enhancer acquisition of the H3K27ac activation mark. The second class ('stable') were pre-established in undifferentiated cells, with enhancers constitutively marked by H3K27ac. The stable class was associated with the canonical conformation regulator cohesin, whereas the gained class was not, implying distinct mechanisms of contact formation and regulation. Analysis of stable enhancers identified a new, essential role for a constitutively expressed, lineage-restricted ETS-family transcription factor, EHF, in epidermal differentiation. Furthermore, neither class of contacts was observed in pluripotent cells, suggesting that lineage-specific chromatin structure is established in tissue progenitor cells and is further remodeled in terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2749393946,"Recurrent mutations in SPOP-encoding a Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase- in prostate cancer disrupt the recognition and degradation of ubiquitination substrates, including BET proteins. Consequently, stability of BET proteins is enhanced and this increases the resistance to BET inhibitors in SPOP-mutant prostate tumors. These results, together with those in Janouskova et al. and Zhang et al., uncover a novel non genetic mechanism of resistance to BET inhibition involving cancer type-specific mutations in SPOP, and support the evaluation of SPOP mutations to inform the administration of BET inhibitors in the clinic. The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins comprises four members—BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and the testis-specific isoform BRDT—that largely function as transcriptional coactivators1,2,3 and play critical roles in various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion4,5. BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia6,7, or by promoting the transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate cancer8. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are clinically linked to various types of human cancer5,9,10; they are therefore being pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients with cancer. To this end, a number of bromodomain inhibitors, including JQ1 and I-BET, have been developed11,12 and have shown promising outcomes in early clinical trials. Although resistance to BET inhibitors has been documented in preclinical models13,14,15, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are largely unknown. Here we report that cullin-3SPOP earmarks BET proteins, including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Pathologically, prostate cancer–associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the degradation of BET proteins, leading to their elevated abundance in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer cell lines and organoids derived from individuals harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET-inhibitor-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, our results elucidate the tumor-suppressor role of SPOP in prostate cancer in which it acts as a negative regulator of BET protein stability and also provide a molecular mechanism for resistance to BET inhibitors in individuals with prostate cancer bearing SPOP mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2745112353,"Three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an anti-viral enzyme that cleaves nucleic acids in the cytosol, preventing accumulation and a subsequent type I interferon-associated inflammatory response. Autoimmune diseases, including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and systemic lupus erythematosus, can arise when TREX1 function is compromised. AGS is a neuroinflammatory disorder with severe and persistent intellectual and physical problems. Here we generated a human AGS model that recapitulates disease-relevant phenotypes using pluripotent stem cells lacking TREX1. We observed abundant extrachromosomal DNA in TREX1-deficient neural cells, of which endogenous Long Interspersed Element-1 retrotransposons were a major source. TREX1-deficient neurons also exhibited increased apoptosis and formed three-dimensional cortical organoids of reduced size. TREX1-deficient astrocytes further contributed to the observed neurotoxicity through increased type I interferon secretion. In this model, reverse-transcriptase inhibitors rescued the neurotoxicity of AGS neurons and organoids, highlighting their potential utility in therapeutic regimens for AGS and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2747084483,"Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein inhibitors are emerging as promising anticancer therapies. The gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-binding adaptor speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is the most frequently mutated in primary prostate cancer. Here we demonstrate that wild-type SPOP binds to and induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4) by recognizing a degron motif common among them. In contrast, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants show impaired binding to BET proteins, resulting in decreased proteasomal degradation and accumulation of these proteins in prostate cancer cell lines and patient specimens and causing resistance to BET inhibitors. Transcriptome and BRD4 cistrome analyses reveal enhanced expression of the GTPase RAC1 and cholesterol-biosynthesis-associated genes together with activation of AKT-mTORC1 signaling as a consequence of BRD4 stabilization. Our data show that resistance to BET inhibitors in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer can be overcome by combination with AKT inhibitors and further support the evaluation of SPOP mutations as biomarkers to guide BET-inhibitor-oriented therapy in patients with prostate cancer."

Ants live in complex societies and display sophisticated social behavior, including reproductive division of labor between queens and workers, behavioral division of labor between nurses and foragers, the formation of adaptive foraging networks, nestmate versus non-nestmate discrimination, and collective nest construction (David Morgan, 2009David Morgan E.

Intracolony chemical communication in social insects.Insectes Soc. 2013; 60: 275-291Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All of these behaviors are largely mediated via chemical communication using a wide range of pheromones. In Drosophila, pheromone receptors have been identified that belong to multiple insect chemosensory receptor families, including odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), and pickpocket channels (PPKs) (Kohl et al., 2015Kohl J. Huoviala P. Jefferis G.S.X.E. Pheromone processing in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 34: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ants have numbers of GRs, IRs, and PPKs that are typical for insects, while their OR repertoire is highly expanded (McKenzie et al., 2016McKenzie S.K. Fetter-Pruneda I. Ruta V. Kronauer D.J.C.

This raises the possibility that the expansion of ORs specifically, rather than chemoreceptors in general, may underlie the evolution of complex chemical communication in ants. Ants also have exceedingly large numbers of glomeruli in their antennal lobes, which likely mirror their expanded OR gene repertoire (McKenzie et al., 2016McKenzie S.K. Fetter-Pruneda I. Ruta V.

Thus, orco constitutes a prime candidate to test the hypothesis that the expanded OR repertoire of ants is required for chemical communication. The receptor families involved in pheromone perception in ants have not been functionally characterized, in part because the complex life cycle of ants has hindered the development of functional genetic tools (Grüter and Keller, 2016Grüter C.

Indeed, to this point, no mutant lines in ants have been generated (e.g., using transgenesis, random mutagenesis, or targeted mutagenesis). Most ant species reproduce sexually, so generating homozygous mutant lines requires multiple generations of crosses, which is challenging given that the generation times of ants tend to be many months (Yan et al., 2014Yan H. Simola D.F. Bonasio R. Liebig J. Berger S.L. Reinberg D. Eusocial insects as emerging models for behavioural epigenetics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, performing such crosses raises methodological concerns, as inbreeding individuals to generate homozygous mutants also has the potential to homozygose off-target mutations (Fu et al., 2013Fu Y. Foden J.A. Khayter C. Maeder M.L. Reyon D. Joung J.K. Sander J.D. High-frequency off-target mutagenesis induced by CRISPR-Cas nucleases in human cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). In other model organisms, this issue can be addressed by using multiple generations of outcrossing, but this is not feasible in species with long generation times such as ants (Fu et al., 2013Fu Y. Foden J.A. Khayter C. Maeder M.L. Reyon D. Joung J.K. Sander J.D. High-frequency off-target mutagenesis induced by CRISPR-Cas nucleases in human cells.Nat.

Thus, most ant species pose major challenges to the generation of mutant lines that can be used to generate reliable scientific results. In this study, we take advantage of the unique biology of the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, to generate the first mutant lines in ants. This species is a promising genetic model system because, unlike most other ant species, O. biroi reproduces via parthenogenesis, so stable germ-line modifications are obtained from the clonal progeny of injected individuals without laboratory crosses (Oxley et al., 2014Oxley P.R. Ji L. Fetter-Pruneda I. McKenzie S.K. Li C. Hu H. Zhang G. Kronauer D.J.C.C. The genome of the clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 451-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this unusual reproductive system implies that it will be challenging to conduct laboratory crosses for other purposes. O. biroi also has a generation time of ∼2 months, which is among the shortest known for any ant species (Oxley et al., 2014Oxley P.R. Ji L. Fetter-Pruneda I. McKenzie S.K. Li C. Hu H. Zhang G. Kronauer D.J.C.C. The genome of the clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 451-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas9 protocol in O. biroi and use this technique to create orco null mutants, allowing us to conclusively test the role of ORs in chemical communication in ants. To reduce the potential for off-target mutagenesis, we designed a guide RNA (gRNA) that has a unique sequence relative to the rest of the genome (see STAR Methods) and characterized multiple independently generated lines of heterozygous and homozygous orco mutants. We find that orco mutant ants, as expected, lack Orco antibody staining and possess deficiencies in general olfactory behaviors. These ants also have deficiencies in social behavior, including an inability to nest with other ants or follow pheromone trails, and exhibit reduced fitness. In contrast with previously studied insects, we also find that orco mutant ants possess striking neuro-anatomical phenotypes, including a loss of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the antennae and a striking reduction in the number of glomeruli in the antennal lobes. Collectively, these results illustrate the crucial significance of orco and ORs in ant biology. We confirmed the identity of orco in the O. biroi genome (Figure S1; Table S2) and designed and synthesized a gRNA to target orco (Figure 1B). To produce orco mutants, we injected Cas9 protein and gRNA into 3,291 eggs <5 hr of age and produced 42 G0 adults, some of which displayed mutations in at least 97% of PCR amplicons of the orco target site (Figure 1C; STAR Methods). G0 mutations in the germline can be inherited by G1s to produce stable modifications to the genome (Reid and O’Brochta, 2016Reid W. O’Brochta D.A. Applications of genome editing in insects.Curr. Opin. Insect Sci. 2016; 13: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Given that O. biroi reproduces through parthenogenesis (Oxley et al., 2014Oxley P.R. Ji L. Fetter-Pruneda I. McKenzie S.K. Li C. Hu H. Zhang G. Kronauer D.J.C.C. The genome of the clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 451-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), stable mutant lines can be clonally propagated from individual mutant G1s and subsequent generations. orco loss-of-function mutant lines are thus derived from G1 eggs with independent frameshift mutations in both orco alleles. We recovered a diverse set of orco mutant lines, including two orcowt/– lines with one frameshift allele and five orco–/– lines with two frameshift alleles (Figure 1D). The phenotypes reported below were consistent across the two orcowt/– lines and across the five orco–/– lines, respectively. Descriptions of the specific lines used in each experiment along with the associated phenotypes for each individual are given in Table S3. To test whether orco frameshift mutations cause a loss of the full-length Orco protein and/or change the distribution of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), we immunostained O. biroi wild-type and orco mutant antennal sections with an Orco antibody and counterstained the cell nuclei with DAPI. Wild-type and orcowt/– O. biroi antennae contained a dense region of Orco-positive OSNs in the center of the antennal club, as indicated by DAPI and Orco staining (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). As predicted, antennae of orco–/– ants lack Orco staining, indicating that the full-length Orco protein is absent (Figures 2B and S2C). Surprisingly, the majority of OSNs in the O. biroi antenna are also absent in orco mutants, as indicated by a reduction in DAPI signal (Figures 2B and S2C). This result suggests that the orco-positive OSNs in the O. biroi antenna are absent in orco mutants, but the smaller number of other types of sensory neurons may remain present. This contrasts with D. melanogaster, in which the antennal OSNs that express orco in wild-types are still present in orco mutant adults (Chiang et al., 2009Chiang A. Priya R. Ramaswami M.

These results contrast strongly with mice, where olfactory receptor function and neuronal activity are essential for the formation and maintenance of the analogous brain region, the olfactory bulb (Yu et al., 2004Yu C.R.

However, D. melanogaster has only 60 ORs and a similar number of glomeruli, while mice possess over 1,000 olfactory receptors and glomeruli. This striking difference suggests that complex olfactory systems must rely on receptor function for their development and/or maintenance. Ants have highly expanded numbers of ORs and antennal lobe glomeruli (McKenzie et al., 2016McKenzie S.K. Fetter-Pruneda I. Ruta V. Kronauer D.J.C.

To address whether OR function might be required for the structure of the ant antennal lobe, we imaged brains using confocal microscopy, measured antennal lobe volumes and the number of glomeruli, and reconstructed antennal lobes in wild-type and orco mutant adults in O. biroi and D. melanogaster. We found that the antennal lobes of orco–/– ants measured only one-third of the volume of wild-type and orcowt/– antennal lobes, and ∼82% of the glomeruli were lost (Figures 3A and 3B; Movie S1). However, all six glomeruli in the T7 cluster of the ant antennal lobe, which is believed to be innervated by olfactory sensory neurons that do not express ORs (Nakanishi et al., 2010Nakanishi A. Nishino H. Watanabe H. Yokohari F. Nishikawa M. Sex-specific antennal sensory system in the ant Camponotus japonicus: glomerular organizations of antennal lobes.J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518: 2186-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), were still present in orco–/– individuals. No differences were observed in the volume of the protocerebrum, mushroom bodies, or central complex relative to wild-type ants (p = 0.45, 0.17, and 0.20, respectively; t test). In contrast, we detected no significant difference in antennal lobe volumes and only minor potential differences in glomerulus numbers between wild-type and orco–/– flies (Figures 3C and 3D; Movie S1; STAR Methods). To test whether antennal lobes degenerate as a function of age in orco–/– flies, we imaged antennal lobes of additional wild-type and orco–/– flies aged for 30 days, showing that antennal lobe glomeruli were not reduced (Figure 3C). These results demonstrate that development and/or maintenance of antennal lobes in ants, but not flies, are indeed dependent on Orco function. Based on the general observation that ants are often repelled by the smell of permanent markers, we developed a simple assay to test whether orco mutants have compromised chemosensory abilities. We found that wild-type and orcowt/– O. biroi are indeed strongly repelled by lines drawn with Sharpie permanent marker and rarely contact or cross Sharpie lines (Figures 4A–4C). Given that O. biroi is blind, and the ants are often repelled before touching the Sharpie lines (Movie S2), it is clear that this behavior is mediated via olfaction, rather than visual or tactile cues. However, orco–/– O. biroi are significantly less repelled by Sharpie (Figures 4A–4C; Movie S2), implying that orco is required to perceive the odorants that cause Sharpie lines to be repulsive. These results suggest that orco mutant ants possess general olfactory deficiencies, similar to orco mutants in other types of insects (Asahina et al., 2008Asahina K. Pavlenkovich V. Vosshall L.B.

Pheromone trails are a major feature of chemical communication in many ants and are important for coordinating collective behaviors (David Morgan, 2009David Morgan E. Trail pheromones of ants.Physiol. Entomol. 2009; 34: 1-17Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Zube et al., 2008Zube C. Kleineidam C.J. Kirschner S. Neef J. Rössler W.

In many doryline ants, including O. biroi, disturbance of colonies leads to robust trail formation, likely for the purpose of nest relocation (Gotwald, 1995Gotwald W.H. Army Ants: the Biology of Social Predation. Cornell University Press, Ithica, New York1995Crossref Google Scholar, Hölldobler, 1982Hölldobler B.

Army Ants: A Study in Social Organization. WH Freeman, San Francisco, CA1971Google Scholar). To test whether orco influences the ability of O. biroi to follow pheromone trails, we set up five experimental colonies composed of 12–14 identically reared G1s with wild-type, orcowt/–, and orco–/– genotypes and individually tagged each ant with color dots (Figure 4D). We recorded videos of each colony and used a novel custom-built automated behavioral tracking system employing painted color tags (rather than paper barcodes) (Mersch et al., 2013Mersch D.P. Crespi A. Keller L. Tracking individuals shows spatial fidelity is a key regulator of ant social organization.Science. 2013; 340: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) to individually identify the ants and quantify their behavior (Figures 4D and S3; Movies S3 and S4). We disturbed each colony at the beginning of each video, causing the colonies to form conspicuous trails. During the ensuing period of high activity, we created a 2D histogram, or density map, of movement for each ant and measured the Pearson correlation coefficient of this density map with the density map of the other ants in the colony, reasoning that density maps would be more highly correlated when ants were following pheromone trails (Figures 4E and 4F). To provide a null expectation, we also compared the density maps of individual ants to a randomized density map of other ants in the colony (Figures 4E and 4F). We found that the density maps of individual ants had significantly higher correlations with the density maps of the rest of the ants in the colony than with the randomized density maps in wild-type, but not orco–/–, ants (Figure 4F; average correlation coefficients were 0.31 versus 0.04 in wild-type and 0.07 versus 0.02 in orco–/–, respectively). These findings imply that trail following behavior is reduced or absent in orco–/– ants, likely because they are unable to perceive chemical pheromone trails. Nesting behavior, and the formation of aggregations more generally, is a ubiquitous feature of social insect biology (Depickere et al., 2004Depickere S. Fresneau D. Deneubourg J.L. A basis for spatial and social patterns in ant species: Dynamics and mechanisms of aggregation.J. Insect Behav. 2004; 17: 81-97Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Immediately upon eclosion, we noticed that some G1s did not nest with other ants, but instead showed a wandering phenotype (Figure 4G). In a set of 16 G1 colonies, we used this wandering phenotype to identify colonies containing orco–/– ants with 100% accuracy (p < 0.001, Fisher exact test, see STAR Methods). To more precisely measure nesting behavior in orco mutants, we recorded and analyzed 24 hr videos of each experimental colony. We found that wild-type and orcowt/– ants aggregated into tight clusters and exhibited little movement outside the cluster, while orco–/– ants frequently exited the cluster and wandered around the dish (Figure 4H; Movie S3). Overall, orco–/– ants spent a significantly larger fraction of time without contact with other ants when compared to wild-type and orcowt/– ants (Figure 4I). These findin"

Although unclear why, head-on transcription (lagging strand genes) is especially disruptive to replication and promotes genomic instability. Here, we find that head-on collisions promote R-loop formation in Bacillus subtilis. We show that pervasive R-loop formation at head-on collision regions completely blocks replication, elevates mutagenesis, and inhibits gene expression. Accordingly, the activity of the R-loop processing enzyme RNase HIII at collision regions is crucial for stress survival in B. subtilis, as many stress response genes are head-on to replication. Remarkably, without RNase HIII, the ability of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to infect and replicate in hosts is weakened significantly, most likely because many virulence genes are head-on to replication. We conclude that the detrimental effects of head-on collisions stem primarily from excessive R-loop formation and that the resolution of these structures is critical for bacterial stress survival and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2743492091,"Ants exhibit cooperative behaviors and advanced forms of sociality that depend on pheromone-mediated communication. Odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) express specific odorant receptors (ORs) encoded by a dramatically expanded gene family in ants. In most eusocial insects, only the queen can transmit genetic information, restricting genetic studies. In contrast, workers in Harpegnathos saltator ants can be converted into gamergates (pseudoqueens) that can found entire colonies. This feature facilitated CRISPR-Cas9 generation of germline mutations in orco, the gene that encodes the obligate co-receptor of all ORs. orco mutations should significantly impact olfaction. We demonstrate striking functions of Orco in odorant perception, reproductive physiology, and social behavior plasticity. Surprisingly, unlike in other insects, loss of OR functionality also dramatically impairs development of the antennal lobe to which ORNs project. Therefore, the development of genetics in Harpegnathos establishes this ant species as a model organism to study the complexity of eusociality."
https://openalex.org/W2744641317,"Normal homeostatic functions of adult stem cells have rhythmic daily oscillations that are believed to become arrhythmic during aging. Unexpectedly, we find that aged mice remain behaviorally circadian and that their epidermal and muscle stem cells retain a robustly rhythmic core circadian machinery. However, the oscillating transcriptome is extensively reprogrammed in aged stem cells, switching from genes involved in homeostasis to those involved in tissue-specific stresses, such as DNA damage or inefficient autophagy. Importantly, deletion of circadian clock components did not reproduce the hallmarks of this reprogramming, underscoring that rewiring, rather than arrhythmia, is associated with physiological aging. While age-associated rewiring of the oscillatory diurnal transcriptome is not recapitulated by a high-fat diet in young adult mice, it is significantly prevented by long-term caloric restriction in aged mice. Thus, stem cells rewire their diurnal timed functions to adapt to metabolic cues and to tissue-specific age-related traits."

Their study revealed gene combinations that functionally drive gliomagenesis from normal glia in native mouse brains. The authors further demonstrate that mutational background can differentially influence gene expression and chemotherapeutic resistance. A causative understanding of genetic factors that regulate glioblastoma pathogenesis is of central importance. Here we developed an adeno-associated virus–mediated, autochthonous genetic CRISPR screen in glioblastoma. Stereotaxic delivery of a virus library targeting genes commonly mutated in human cancers into the brains of conditional-Cas9 mice resulted in tumors that recapitulate human glioblastoma. Capture sequencing revealed diverse mutational profiles across tumors. The mutation frequencies in mice correlated with those in two independent patient cohorts. Co-mutation analysis identified co-occurring driver combinations such as B2m–Nf1, Mll3–Nf1 and Zc3h13–Rb1, which were subsequently validated using AAV minipools. Distinct from Nf1-mutant tumors, Rb1-mutant tumors are undifferentiated and aberrantly express homeobox gene clusters. The addition of Zc3h13 or Pten mutations altered the gene expression profiles of Rb1 mutants, rendering them more resistant to temozolomide. Our study provides a functional landscape of gliomagenesis suppressors in vivo."

Functional studies suggest that the phenotypes result from impaired protein translation, thus leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. Galloway–Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is an autosomal-recessive disease characterized by the combination of early-onset nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and microcephaly with brain anomalies. Here we identified recessive mutations in OSGEP, TP53RK, TPRKB, and LAGE3, genes encoding the four subunits of the KEOPS complex, in 37 individuals from 32 families with GAMOS. CRISPR–Cas9 knockout in zebrafish and mice recapitulated the human phenotype of primary microcephaly and resulted in early lethality. Knockdown of OSGEP, TP53RK, or TPRKB inhibited cell proliferation, which human mutations did not rescue. Furthermore, knockdown of these genes impaired protein translation, caused endoplasmic reticulum stress, activated DNA-damage-response signaling, and ultimately induced apoptosis. Knockdown of OSGEP or TP53RK induced defects in the actin cytoskeleton and decreased the migration rate of human podocytes, an established intermediate phenotype of SRNS. We thus identified four new monogenic causes of GAMOS, describe a link between KEOPS function and human disease, and delineate potential pathogenic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2748520706,"It is generally assumed that recurrent mutations within a given cancer driver gene elicit similar drug responses. Cancer genome studies have identified recurrent but divergent missense mutations affecting the substrate-recognition domain of the ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in endometrial and prostate cancers. The therapeutic implications of these mutations remain incompletely understood. Here we analyzed changes in the ubiquitin landscape induced by endometrial cancer-associated SPOP mutations and identified BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 proteins (BETs) as SPOP-CUL3 substrates that are preferentially degraded by endometrial cancer-associated SPOP mutants. The resulting reduction of BET protein levels sensitized cancer cells to BET inhibitors. Conversely, prostate cancer-specific SPOP mutations resulted in impaired degradation of BETs, promoting their resistance to pharmacologic inhibition. These results uncover an oncogenomics paradox, whereby mutations mapping to the same domain evoke opposing drug susceptibilities. Specifically, we provide a molecular rationale for the use of BET inhibitors to treat patients with endometrial but not prostate cancer who harbor SPOP mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2743852767,"Social insects are emerging models to study how gene regulation affects behavior because their colonies comprise individuals with the same genomes but greatly different behavioral repertoires. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that activate distinct behaviors in different castes, we exploit a natural behavioral plasticity in Harpegnathos saltator, where adult workers can transition to a reproductive, queen-like state called gamergate. Analysis of brain transcriptomes during the transition reveals that corazonin, a neuropeptide homologous to the vertebrate gonadotropin-releasing hormone, is downregulated as workers become gamergates. Corazonin is also preferentially expressed in workers and/or foragers from other social insect species. Injection of corazonin in transitioning Harpegnathos individuals suppresses expression of vitellogenin in the brain and stimulates worker-like hunting behaviors, while inhibiting gamergate behaviors, such as dueling and egg deposition. We propose that corazonin is a central regulator of caste identity and behavior in social insects."

Here, we show that the regional hypersalinity, required for the kidney's urine-concentrating function, instructs epithelial cells to produce chemokines that localize monocyte-derived mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to the medulla. This hypersaline environment also increases the intrinsic bactericidal and neutrophil chemotactic activities of MNPs to generate a zone of defense. Because MNP positioning and function are dynamically regulated by the renal salt gradient, we find that patients with urinary concentrating defects are susceptible to kidney infection.

We found that the OCRs are highly dynamic and can stratify GWAS-implicated SZ risk variants. Of the more than 3,500 SZ-associated variants analyzed, we prioritized ∼100 putatively functional ones located in neuronal OCRs, including rs1198588, at a leading risk locus flanking MIR137. Excitatory neurons derived from hiPSCs with CRISPR/Cas9-edited rs1198588 or a rare proximally located SZ risk variant showed altered MIR137 expression, dendrite arborization, and synapse maturation. Our study shows that noncoding disease variants in OCRs can affect neurodevelopment, and that analysis of open chromatin regions can help prioritize functionally relevant noncoding variants identified by GWAS."

We demonstrate that following postnatal ablation of granule cell progenitors, Nestin-expressing progenitors, specified during mid-embryogenesis to produce astroglia and interneurons, switch their fate and generate granule neurons in mice. Moreover, Hedgehog signaling in two Nestin-expressing progenitor populations is crucial not only for the compensatory replenishment of granule neurons but also for scaling interneuron and astrocyte numbers. Thus, we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying robustness of circuit formation in the cerebellum and speculate that adaptive reprogramming of progenitors in other brain regions plays a greater role than appreciated in developmental regeneration."

Although a given coding transcript and the divergent upstream non-coding transcript share the same promoter region, each transcript originates from a different preinitiation complex (Rhee and Pugh, 2012Rhee H.S. Pugh B.F. Genome-wide structure and organization of eukaryotic pre-initiation complexes.Nature. 2012; 483: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and thus are initiated by different core promoters. In addition, divergent non-coding transcripts are often observed in enhancers that can be located far upstream or downstream of the promoter region. Several possible functions, such as maintenance of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and de novo gene formation (Scruggs et al., 2015Scruggs B.S. Gilchrist D.A. Nechaev S. Muse G.W. Burkholder A.

On the other hand, divergent transcription may be the by-product of an open chromatin region and thus represent transcriptional noise (de Boer et al., 2014de Boer C.G. van Bakel H. Tsui K. Li J.

Transcriptional noise and the fidelity of initiation by RNA polymerase II.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). At the heart of this debate lies the question of intrinsic directionality. Are promoter regions intrinsically unidirectional and then shaped by evolution to support divergent transcription, or are they intrinsically bidirectional? Consistent with the unidirectional model, divergent transcription is not observed equally across eukaryotes (Core et al., 2012Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Gilchrist D.A. Fargo D.C. Kwak H. Adelman K. Lis J.T. Defining the status of RNA polymerase at promoters.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and sense and antisense divergent transcription rates do not correlate (Churchman and Weissman, 2011Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Further, directionality is controlled by a number of regulators (Churchman and Weissman, 2011Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S.

Chromatin remodelling at promoters suppresses antisense transcription.Nature. 2007; 450: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pervasive divergent transcription across fungal and mammalian genomes (>80% of promoter regions) supports the idea that promoter regions are intrinsically bidirectional. Functional analyses of native, and hence highly evolved, organisms in vivo cannot distinguish whether bidirectional promoter regions and non-coding transcripts are a mechanistic consequence of transcription or an evolved biological function. In principle, this distinction can be addressed by analyzing transcription of evolutionarily irrelevant DNA. In this study, we use a functional evolutionary approach to investigate the intrinsic directionality of yeast promoter regions and how promoter region directionality evolves (Hughes et al., 2012Hughes A.L. Jin Y. Rando O.J. Struhl K. A functional evolutionary approach to identify determinants of nucleosome positioning: a unifying model for establishing the genome-wide pattern.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 5-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Specifically, we compare Pol II occupancy across native S. cerevisiae, K. lactis, and D. hansenii genomes with S. cerevisiae strains containing large regions of these foreign yeast species genome. Of particular note, we previously described nucleosome-depleted regions that fortuitously occur in D. hansenii coding regions when they are present in S. cerevisiae (Hughes et al., 2012Hughes A.L. Jin Y. Rando O.J. Struhl K. A functional evolutionary approach to identify determinants of nucleosome positioning: a unifying model for establishing the genome-wide pattern.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 5-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These regions, which presumably arise by fortuitous binding of S. cerevisiae activators that recruit nucleosome remodelers, often function as promoters, although transcription was minimally characterized. As D. hansenii coding regions are evolutionarily irrelevant for transcriptional initiation in S. cerevisiae, they represent an ideal case in which to mechanistically examine the issue of bidirectional transcription in the absence of evolutionary constraints. We then combine this information with evolutionary analysis of yeast species to address how promoter directionality has evolved. While coding mRNAs are relatively long-lived, the corresponding antisense transcripts are rapidly degraded non-coding RNAs. Consequently, to quantitate promoter directionality, nascent transcription in each direction must be monitored. Using native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) to precisely and quantitatively map engaged Pol II complexes across the S. cerevisiae genome (Churchman and Weissman, 2011Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), we define a directionality score based on the ratio of sense and antisense reads (Figures 1A and 1B ). Because of the compact yeast genome, we focused our analysis on promoter regions between tandemly oriented genes in order to avoid analyzing coding transcription in the antisense direction. Consistent with previous reports (Churchman and Weissman, 2011Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae promoter regions exhibit higher sense transcription than divergent antisense transcription on average (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B) The majority (>70%) of promoter regions are “directional,” defined by at least three times more sense transcription than antisense transcription, including highly directional cases in which no antisense is detected. On the other hand, approximately a quarter of promoter regions are “bidirectional” that we define as sense:antisense ratios between 1/3 and 3 (Figure 1B). Importantly, NET-seq measures of directionality positively correlate with directionality measures using TFIIB ChIP-exo data (Rhee and Pugh, 2012Rhee H.S. Pugh B.F. Genome-wide structure and organization of eukaryotic pre-initiation complexes.Nature. 2012; 483: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) that correspond to initiation rates and 4tU-seq (Schulz et al., 2013Schulz D.

To address whether promoter regions are intrinsically unidirectional or bidirectional, we analyzed promoter directionality in K. lactis, in D. hansenii, and in five S. cerevisiae strains each containing a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) harboring a ∼150-kb piece of K. lactis or D. hansenii DNA (Figures 2A and S1D; see STAR Methods) (Hughes et al., 2012Hughes A.L.

Because of the lack of transcription start site annotation for these yeast species, we developed FIDDLE (flexible integration of data with deep learning), an integrative deep learning tool that leverages multiple types of available genomics data to predict genome-wide transcription start sites (Eser and Churchman, 2016Eser U.

None of them are significantly different than the overall changes in directionality score. Error bars show the standard error of the mean for the set of promoter regions with a particular transcription factor binding motif. Like in S. cerevisiae, promoter regions in both K. lactis and D. hansenii are predominantly directional (Figures 2B and 2C). Interestingly, a global-scale comparison of native K. lactis and D. hansenii with the S. cerevisiae strains containing the corresponding foreign yeast DNA reveals a reproducible loss in promoter directionality when DNA is in a foreign environment (p values < 10−4 and 2.3 × 10−3 for K. lactis and D. hansenii, respectively, using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test) (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2C–S2E). We do not observe an enrichment of any S. cerevisiae transcription factor motifs at promoter regions that change in directionality (Figure S2F). Thus, the decrease in directional bias suggests that some DNA sequences on the heterologous promoter regions are no longer recognized by S. cerevisiae proteins, and consequently are unable to promote directionality in the foreign environment. Therefore, the overall decrease in directionality and the absence of highly directional transcription from the heterologous promoter regions suggests that the ground-state of transcription is bidirectional. In the experiments described above, promoter directionality is not entirely lost in a foreign environment, due either to residual detection of foreign DNA sequences by S. cerevisiae proteins or an intrinsically directional property of promoter regions. To discriminate between these possibilities, we examined de novo promoter regions that do not exist in the native organism and hence are evolutionarily irrelevant in S. cerevisiae. Using FIDDLE, we identified in an unbiased manner 43 D. hansenii coding sequences that act as fortuitous promoter regions when placed in the foreign environment of the S. cerevisiae nucleus (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). Importantly, we observed that fortuitous promoter regions are predominantly bidirectional, certainly more bidirectional than directionality in native D. hansenii (p value < 10−12 using a KS test) or D. hansenii YACs (p value < 10−5 using a KS test) (Figures 3C and S3B). These fortuitous promoter regions are depleted for nucleosomes with phased nucleosomes on both sides and are enriched for the general transcription factor, TFIIB (Figure 3B) (Hughes et al., 2012Hughes A.L. Jin Y. Rando O.J. Struhl K. A functional evolutionary approach to identify determinants of nucleosome positioning: a unifying model for establishing the genome-wide pattern.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 5-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The majority of de novo nucleosome-depleted regions (71%) co-occur with a fortuitous promoter region. Core promoter elements, TATA-like motifs, are not enriched in fortuitous promoter regions (Table S1). While certain core promoter elements produce strong levels of transcription, a wide variety of DNA sequences are capable of inducing initiation (Lubliner et al., 2013Lubliner S. Keren L. Segal E.

Thus, we propose that the de novo removal of nucleosomes by activators would expose DNA to the transcription machinery, resulting in modest levels of transcription initiation on both strands. In sum, these observations demonstrate that promoter regions are intrinsically bidirectional and hence that directional promoters are molded by evolution.Figure S3Bidirectional Transcription Occurs from Fortuitous Promoter Regions, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Example of a fortuitous promoter region emerging within the coding sequence of a D. hansenii gene, DEHA2D15365 g.

Each kinetochore can act autonomously, and activities change rapidly as proteins are recruited to, or removed from, kinetochores. Understanding this dynamic system requires tools that can manipulate kinetochores on biologically relevant temporal and spatial scales. Optogenetic approaches have the potential to provide temporal and spatial control with molecular specificity. Here we report new chemical inducers of protein dimerization that allow us to both recruit proteins to and release them from kinetochores using light. We use these dimerizers to manipulate checkpoint signaling and molecular motor activity. Our findings demonstrate specialized properties of the CENP-E (kinesin-7) motor for directional chromosome transport to the spindle equator and for maintenance of metaphase alignment. This work establishes a foundation for optogenetic control of kinetochore function, which is broadly applicable to experimental probing of other dynamic cellular processes."

Inducible functional genetic mosaics can be extraordinarily useful in the study of biological systems; however, this experimental approach is still rarely used in vertebrates. This is mainly due to technical difficulties in the assembly of large DNA constructs carrying multiple genes and regulatory elements and their targeting to the genome. In addition, mosaic phenotypic analysis, unlike classical single gene-function analysis, requires clear labeling and detection of multiple cell clones in the same tissue. Here, we describe several methods for the rapid generation of transgenic or gene-targeted mice and embryonic stem (ES) cell lines containing all the necessary elements for inducible, fluorescent, and functional genetic mosaic (ifgMosaic) analysis. This technology enables the interrogation of multiple and combinatorial gene function with high temporal and cellular resolution."

It is unknown, however, whether selective spatial attention operates where the observer is already looking-that is, within the high-acuity foveola, the small yet disproportionally important rod-free region of the retina. Using new methods for precisely controlling retinal stimulation, here we show that covert attention flexibly improves and speeds up both detection and discrimination at loci only a fraction of a degree apart within the foveola. These findings reveal a surprisingly precise control of attention and its involvement in fine spatial vision. They show that the commonly studied covert shifts of attention away from the fovea are the expression of a global mechanism that exerts its action across the entire visual field."

Enhancing production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a promising strategy to suppress pathogenic inflammation. To identify new mechanisms regulating IL-10 production, we conducted a phenotypic screen for small molecules that enhance IL-10 secretion from activated dendritic cells. Mechanism-of-action studies using a prioritized hit from the screen, BRD6989, identified the Mediator-associated kinase CDK8, and its paralog CDK19, as negative regulators of IL-10 production during innate immune activation. The ability of BRD6989 to upregulate IL-10 is recapitulated by multiple, structurally differentiated CDK8 and CDK19 inhibitors and requires an intact cyclin C–CDK8 complex. Using a highly parallel pathway reporter assay, we identified a role for enhanced AP-1 activity in IL-10 potentiation following CDK8 and CDK19 inhibition, an effect associated with reduced phosphorylation of a negative regulatory site on c-Jun. These findings identify a function for CDK8 and CDK19 in regulating innate immune activation and suggest that these kinases may warrant consideration as therapeutic targets for inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2743496055,"Lower glycolysis involves a series of reversible reactions, which interconvert intermediates that also feed anabolic pathways. 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) is an abundant lower glycolytic intermediate that feeds serine biosynthesis via the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, which is genomically amplified in several cancers. Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) catalyzes the isomerization of 3-PG into the downstream glycolytic intermediate 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG). PGAM1 needs to be histidine phosphorylated to become catalytically active. We show that the primary PGAM1 histidine phosphate donor is 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), which is made from the glycolytic intermediate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) by bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM). When BPGM is knocked out, 1,3-BPG can directly phosphorylate PGAM1. In this case, PGAM1 phosphorylation and activity are decreased, but nevertheless sufficient to maintain normal glycolytic flux and cellular growth rate. 3-PG, however, accumulates, leading to increased serine synthesis. Thus, one biological function of BPGM is controlling glycolytic intermediate levels and thereby serine biosynthetic flux."
https://openalex.org/W2743055566,"MPTP-mouse model constitutes a well-known model of neuroinflammation and mitochondrial failure occurring in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although it has been extensively reported that nitric oxide (NO●) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PD, the relative roles of nitric oxide synthase isoforms iNOS and nNOS in the nigrostriatal pathway remains, however, unclear. Here, the participation of iNOS/nNOS isoforms in the mitochondrial dysfunction was analyzed in iNOS and nNOS deficient mice. Our results showed that MPTP increased iNOS activity in substantia nigra and striatum, whereas it sharply reduced complex I activity and mitochondrial bioenergetics in all strains. In the presence of MPTP, mice lacking iNOS showed similar restricted mitochondrial function than wild type or mice lacking nNOS. These results suggest that iNOS-dependent elevated nitric oxide, a major pathological hallmark of neuroinflammation in PD, does not contribute to mitochondrial impairment. Therefore, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysregulation seem to act in parallel in the MPTP model of PD. Melatonin administration, with well-reported neuroprotective properties, counteracted these effects, preventing from the drastic changes in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, increased NOS activity and prevented reduced locomotor activity induced by MPTP. The protective effects of melatonin on mitochondria are also independent of its anti-inflammatory properties, but both effects are required for an effective anti-parkinsonian activity of the indoleamine as reported in this study."

The resulting shortened questionnaire, XS5, was compared to the original S5 using data from student samples in 6 different countries (Estonia, Finland, UK, Germany, Spain, and China), and a representative Finnish sample. The correlations between XS5 domain scales and their longer counterparts from well-established scales ranged from 0.74 to 0.84; the difference from the equivalent correlations for full version of S5 or from meta-analytic short-term dependability coefficients of NEO PI-R was not large. In terms of prediction of external criteria (emotional experience and self-reported behaviours), there were no important differences between XS5, S5, and the longer well-established scales. Controlling for acquiescence did not improve the prediction of criteria, self-peer correlations, or correlations with longer scales, but it did improve internal reliability and, in some analyses, comparability of the principal component structure. XS5 can be recommended as an economic measure of the five-factor model of personality at the level of domain scales; it has reasonable psychometric properties, fair correlations with longer well-established scales, and it can predict emotional experience and self-reported behaviours no worse than S5. When subscales are essential, we would still recommend using the full version of S5."
https://openalex.org/W2743176900,"Hairy root culture is a potential alternative to conventional mammalian cell culture to produce recombinant proteins due to its ease in protein recovery, low costs and absence of potentially human pathogenic contaminants. The current study focussed to develop a new platform of a hairy root culture system from Nicotiana tabacum for the production of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO), which is regularly produced in mammalian cells. The human EPO construct was amplified with C-terminal hexahistidine tag from a cDNA of Caco-2 cells. Two versions of rhEPO clones, with or without the N-terminal calreticulin (cal) fusion sequence, were produced by cloning the amplified construct into gateway binary vector pK7WG2D. Following Agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated transformation of tobacco explants; integration and expression of constructs in hairy roots were confirmed by several tests at DNA, RNA and protein levels. The amount of intracellular rhEPO from hairy root cultures with cal signal peptide was measured up to 66.75 ng g-1 of total soluble protein. The presence of the ER signal peptide (cal) was essential for the secretion of rhEPO into the spent medium; no protein was detected from hairy root cultures without ER signal peptide. The addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone enhanced the stabilization of secreted rhEPO leading to a 5.6 fold increase to a maximum concentration of 185.48 pg rhEPOHR g-1 FW hairy root cultures. The rhizo-secreted rhEPO was separated by HPLC and its biological activity was confirmed by testing distinct parameters for proliferation and survival in retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE). In addition, the rhEPO was detected to an amount 14.8 ng g-1 of total soluble leaf protein in transgenic T0 generation plantlets regenerated from hairy root cultures with cal signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2743641223,"Background High expression of the RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) has been shown to correlate, with prolonged survival in several malignant diseases and with the benefit of platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate RBM3 in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) as a prognostic factor for overall survival and in relation to benefit of first-line chemotherapy. Methods Immunohistochemical staining was conducted and evaluated in tumours from 455 mCRC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression proportional hazards models were used to access the impact of RBM3 expression on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results High RBM3 expression, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, was an independent prognostic factor for prolonged OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50–0.90 and HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48–0.91, respectively). PFS was significantly longer in patients with high RBM3 expression who had received first-line oxaliplatin based treatment, compared to those who had received irinotecan based treatment, both regarding nuclear and cytoplasmic expression (p-value 0.020 and 0.022 respectively). Conclusion High RBM3 expression is an independent predictor of prolonged survival in mCRC patients, in particular in patients treated with first-line oxaliplatin based chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2742281543,"The aim of this investigation was to compare serum growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in response to a combined sprint and resistance training (CSRT) program in young and middle-aged men.Thirty-eight healthy, moderately trained men participated in this study. Young and middle-aged men were randomly assigned to, a young training group (YT = 10, 21.4±1.2yrs) ora young control group (YC = 9, 21.6±1.8 yrs), a middle-aged training group (MAT = 10, 40.4±2.1 yrs) or a middle-aged control group (MAC = 9, 40.5±1.8 yrs). Participants performed the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT) before and after a 13-week CSRT program (three sessions per week). Blood samples were collected at rest, after warm-up, immediately post-WAnT, and 10 min post-WAnT. CSRT induced increases in GH at rest and in response to the WAnT in YT and MAT (P<0.05). CSRT-induced increases were observed for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 at rest in MAT only (P<0.05). Pre-training, GH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were significantly higher at rest and in response to the WAnT in young participants as compared to their middle-aged counterparts (P<0.05). Post-training, YT and MAT had comparable basal GH (P>0.05). In response to the WAnT, amelioration of the age-effect was observed between YT and MAT for IGF-1 and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio following CSRT (P>0.05). These data suggest that CSRT increases the activity of the GH/IGF-1 axis at rest and in response to the WAnT in young and middle-aged men. In addition, CSRT reduces the normal age-related decline of somatotropic hormones in middle-age men."
https://openalex.org/W2744177965,"Intestinal wound healing is a new therapeutic goal for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as complete healing of the mucosa is the key element of clinical remission in IBD. Previous studies showed that termination of inflammation can be achieved by adding pro-resolving lipids like DHA and EPA exogenously. However, the roles of these lipids in mucosal healing have not been investigated. To recapitulate intestinal healing process, mice were received dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days in the drinking water followed by regular tap water for 5 additional days. DSS-induced intestinal inflammation featuring body weight loss, histological tissue damage, increased cytokine production and infiltration of inflammatory cells was gradually reduced upon switching to water. To investigate whether endogenous lipids play a role in mucosal healing, the lipidomics analysis of mouse serum was performed. Reduced levels of arachidonic acid, the biosynthetic precursor of prostaglandin F (PGF)2α, 19H-PGF1α, the metabolite of prostacyclin, and 20H-PGF2α, the metabolite of PGF2α, suggest subsiding inflammation. In contrast, increased levels of an active metabolite of resolvin D1 along with decreased levels of its precursor DHA as well as decreased levels of the precursor of resolvin E, 18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid, suggest inauguration of mucosal healing by endogenous lipids. Furthermore, exogenously supplied fish oil enhanced the process even further. These results suggest the presence of mucosal healing regulated by endogenous pro-healing lipids and also indicate that the remission state of IBD could be prolonged by enhancing the levels of these lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2744685614,"We examined the contribution of social disadvantage to the black-white disparity in preterm birth. Analyses included linked vital and hospital discharge records from 127,358 black and 615,721 white singleton California births from 2007–11. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated by 4 logistic regression models for 2 outcomes: early (<32 wks) and moderate (32–36 wks) spontaneous preterm birth (ePTB, mPTB), stratified by 2 race-ethnicity groups (blacks and whites). We then conducted a potential impact analysis. The OR for less than high school education (vs. college degree) was 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.6, 2.1) for ePTB among whites but smaller for the other 3 outcome groups (ORs 1.3–1.4). For all 4 groups, higher census tract poverty was associated with increased odds (ORs 1.03–1.05 per 9% change in poverty). Associations were less noteworthy for the other variables (payer, and tract percent black and Gini index of income inequality). Setting 3 factors (education, poverty, payer) to ‘favorable’ values was associated with lower predicted probability of ePTB (25% lower among blacks, 31% among whites) but a 9% higher disparity, compared to probabilities based on observed values; for mPTB, respective percentages were 28% and 13% lower probability, and 17% lower disparity. Results suggest that social determinants contribute to preterm delivery and its disparities, and that future studies should focus on ePTB and more specific factors related to social circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W2551833533,"Dyslexia is a developmental learning disorder of single word reading accuracy and/or fluency, with compelling research directed towards understanding the contributions of the visual system. While dyslexia is not an oculomotor disease, readers with dyslexia have shown different eye movements than typically developing students during text reading. Readers with dyslexia exhibit longer and more frequent fixations, shorter saccade lengths, more backward refixations than typical readers. Furthermore, readers with dyslexia are known to have difficulty in reading long words, lower skipping rate of short words, and high gaze duration on many words. It is an open question whether it is possible to harness these distinctive oculomotor scanning patterns observed during reading in order to develop a screening tool that can reliably identify struggling readers, who may be candidates for dyslexia. Here, we introduce a novel, fast, objective, non-invasive method, named Rapid Assessment of Difficulties and Abnormalities in Reading (RADAR) that screens for features associated with the aberrant visual scanning of reading text seen in dyslexia. Eye tracking parameter measurements that are stable under retest and have high discriminative power, as indicated by their ROC curves, were obtained during silent text reading. These parameters were combined to derive a total reading score (TRS) that can reliably separate readers with dyslexia from typical readers. We tested TRS in a group of school-age children ranging from 8.5 to 12.5 years of age. TRS achieved 94.2% correct classification of children tested. Specifically, 35 out of 37 control (specificity 94.6%) and 30 out of 32 readers with dyslexia (sensitivity 93.8%) were classified correctly using RADAR, under a circular validation condition where the individual evaluated was not included in the test construction group."
https://openalex.org/W2742296838,"Spacing effects during retention of verbal information are easily obtained, and the effect size is large. Relatively little evidence exists on whether motor skill retention benefits from distributed practice, with even less evidence on complex motor skills. We taught a 17-note musical sequence on a piano to individuals without prior formal training. There were five lags between learning episodes: 0-, 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-min. After a 5-min retention interval, participants' performance was measured using three criteria: accuracy of note playing, consistency in pressure applied to the keys, and consistency in timing. No spacing effect was found, suggesting that the effect may not always be demonstrable for complex motor skills or non-verbal abilities (timing and motor skills). Additionally, we taught short phrases from five songs, using the same set of lags and retention interval, and did not find any spacing effect for accuracy of song reproduction. Our findings indicate that although the spacing effect is one of the most robust phenomena in the memory literature (as demonstrated by verbal learning studies), the effect may vary when considered in the novel realm of complex motor skills such as piano performance."
https://openalex.org/W2743149282,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular stores of neutral fat that facilitate lipid and protein trafficking in response to metabolic cues. Unlike other vesicles, the phospholipid membrane on the LD is a monolayer. Interestingly, this monolayer membrane has free cholesterol, and may therefore contain lipid microdomains that serve as a platform for assembling proteins involved in signal transduction, cell polarity, pathogen entry etc. In support of this, cell culture studies have detected microdomain-associated “raftophilic” proteins on LDs. However, the physiological significance of this observation has been unclear. Here we show that two proteins (Flotillin-1 and SNAP23) that bind to membrane microdomains associate differently with LDs purified from rat liver depending on the feeding/fasting state of the animal. Flotillin-1 increases on LDs in the fed state, possibly because LDs interact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating supply of flotillin-1 from ER to LDs. Interestingly, this increase in flotillin-1 is correlated with an increase in free cholesterol on the LDs in fed state. In opposite behaviour to flotillin-1, SNAP23 increases on LDs in the fasted state and this appears to mediate LD-mitochondria interactions. Such LD-mitochondria interactions may provide fatty acids to mitochondria for promoting beta-oxidation in hepatocytes in response to fasting. Our work brings out physiologically relevant aspects of lipid droplet biology that are different from, and may not be entirely possible to replicate and study in cell culture."
https://openalex.org/W2744459397,"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common disease in cattle and wildlife, with health, zoonotic and economic implications. Infected wild animals, and particularly reservoirs, could hinder eradication of bTB from cattle populations, which could have an important impact on international cattle trade. Therefore, surveillance of bTB in wildlife is of particular importance to better understand the epidemiological role of wild species and to adapt the control measures. In France, a bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife, the Sylvatub system, has been implemented since 2011. It relies on three surveillance components (SSCs) (passive surveillance on hunted animals (EC-SSC), passive surveillance on dead or dying animals (SAGIR-SSC) and active surveillance (PSURV-SSC)). The effectiveness of the Sylvatub system was previously assessed, through the estimation of its sensitivity (i.e. the probability of detecting at least one case of bTB infection by each SSC, specie and risk-level area). However, to globally assess the performance of a surveillance system, the measure of its sensitivity is not sufficient, as other factors such as economic or socio-economic factors could influence the effectiveness. We report here an estimation of the costs of the surveillance activities of the Sylvatub system, and of the cost-effectiveness of each surveillance component, by specie and risk-level, based on scenario tree modelling with the same tree structure as used for the sensitivity evaluation. The cost-effectiveness of the Sylvatub surveillance is better in higher-risk departments, due in particular to the higher probability of detecting the infection (sensitivity). Moreover, EC-SSC, which has the highest unit cost, is more efficient than the surveillance enhanced by the SAGIR-SSC, due to its better sensitivity. The calculation of the cost-effectiveness ratio shows that PSURV-SSC remains the most cost-effective surveillance component of the Sylvatub system, despite its high cost in terms of coordination, sample collection and laboratory analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2743549886,"Wnt10b is a crucial regulator of bone density through its ability to promote osteoblastogenesis. Parathyroid hormone has been shown to regulate Wnt10b expression in CD8+ T cells. However, the relative expression and other source(s) of Wnt10b in the bone marrow immune cells (BMICs) is unknown. Sex hormones and cytokines such as, estrogen and TNFα are critical regulators of bone physiology but whether they regulate BMIC Wnt10b expression is unclear. To determine the potential regulation of Wnt10b by estrogen and TNFα, we assessed Wnt10b expression by flow cytometry under estrogen- and TNFα-deficient conditions.Effects of TNFα was determined in male and female C57BL/6 wildtype and TNFα knockout mice. Effect of estrogen was investigated 4, 6 and 8 weeks post-surgery in ovariectomized Balb/c mice. Intracellular Wnt10b was detected using goat anti-mouse Wnt10b and a conjugated secondary antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry.Wnt10b expression was sex- and lineage-specific. Females had 1.8-fold higher Wnt10b signal compared to males. Percent of Wnt10b+ myeloid cells was higher in females than males (8.9% Vs 5.4%) but Wnt10b+ lymphoid cells was higher in males than females (6.3% Vs 2.5%). TNFα ablation in males increased total BM Wnt10b expression 1.5-fold but significantly reduced the percentage of BM Wnt10b+ CD4+ T cells (65%), CD8+ T cells (59%), dendritic cells (59%), macrophages (56%) and granulocytes (52%). These effects of TNFα on Wnt10b were observed only in males. In contrast to TNFα, estrogen-deficiency had indirect effects on BMIC Wnt10b levels; reducing the average percentage of BM Wnt10b+ CD8+ T cells (25%) and granulocytes (26%) across an 8-week time course.Our results demonstrate unique cell type- and sex-dependent effects on BMIC Wnt10b expression. Together, our results reveal myeloid cells in the bone marrow as an important source of Wnt10b under complex hormonal and cytokine regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2743571706,"The addition of a cosmetic glove to an upper limb prosthesis has a distinct effect on the cosmetic value, but its viscoelastic behaviour adds a substantial amount of stiffness and hysteresis to the system. As a result, the overall usability of the prosthesis is degraded. A novel negative stiffness element is designed to compensate for the cosmetic glove's stiffness. A combination of linear helical springs and the concept of rolling link mechanisms has resulted in a Rolling Stiffness Compensation Mechanism (RSCM). Results show that the RSCM is capable of exerting a progressive negative stiffness characteristic and can be built small enough to fit inside a 33 mm diameter wrist. Using the RSCM, an otherwise voluntary opening toddler-sized prosthesis is converted into a voluntary closing device, reducing maximum operation forces down to 40 N with a combined efficiency of 52%. Further adjustments to the design are possible to further improve the efficiency of the mechanism. Moreover, changes in geometric relations of the mechanism offers possibilities for a wide range of prostheses and other applications."
https://openalex.org/W2743276551,"In the course of evolution, genes traverse the nucleotide sequence space, which translates to a trajectory of changes in the protein sequence in protein sequence space. The correspondence between regions of the nucleotide and protein sequence spaces is understood in general but not in detail. One of the unexplored questions is how many sequences a protein can reach with a certain number of nucleotide substitutions in its gene sequence. Here I propose an algorithm to calculate the volume of protein sequence space accessible to a given protein sequence as a function of the number of nucleotide substitutions made in the protein-coding sequence. The algorithm utilizes the power of the dynamic programming approach, and makes all calculations within a couple of seconds on a desktop computer. I apply the algorithm to green fluorescence protein, and get the number of sequences four times higher than estimated before. However, taking into account the astronomically huge size of the protein sequence space, the previous estimate can be considered as acceptable as an order of magnitude estimation. The proposed algorithm has practical applications in the study of evolutionary trajectories in sequence space."
https://openalex.org/W2743845491,"Shallow water marine seismic surveys are necessary to understand a range of Earth processes in coastal environments, including those that represent major hazards to society such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and sea-level rise. Predicting the acoustic radiation of seismic sources in shallow water, which is required for compliance with regulations designed to limit impacts on protected marine species, is a significant challenge in this environment because of variable reflectivity due to local geology, and the susceptibility of relatively small bathymetric features to focus or shadow acoustic energy. We use data from the R/V Marcus G. Langseth’s towed hydrophone streamer to estimate the acoustic radiation of the ship’s seismic source during a large survey of the shallow shelf off the coast of New Jersey. We use the results to estimate the distances from the source to acoustic levels of regulatory significance, and use bathymetric data from the ship’s multibeam system to explore the relationships between seafloor depth and slope and the measured acoustic radiation patterns. We demonstrate that existing models significantly overestimate mitigation radii, but that the variability of received levels in shallow water suggest that in situ real-time measurements would help improve these estimates, and that post-cruise revisions of received levels are valuable in accurately determining the potential acoustic impact of a seismic survey."
https://openalex.org/W2743951418,"The genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains the surf gene family which encodes large transmembrane proteins of unknown function. While some surf alleles appear to be expressed in sexual stages, others occur in asexual blood stage forms and may be associated to virulence-associated processes and undergo transcriptional switching. We accessed the transcription of surf genes along multiple invasions by real time PCR. Based on the observation of persistent expression of gene surf4.1, we created a parasite line which expresses a conditionally destabilized SURFIN4.1 protein. Upon destabilization of the protein, no interference of parasite growth or morphological changes were detected. However, we observed a strong increase in the transcript quantities of surf4.1 and sometimes of other surf genes in knocked-down parasites. While this effect was reversible when SURFIN4.1 was stabilized again after a few days of destabilization, longer destabilization periods resulted in a transcriptional switch away from surf4.1. When we tested if a longer transcript half-life was responsible for increased transcript detection in SURFIN4.1 knocked-down parasites, no alteration was found compared to control parasite lines. This suggests a specific feedback of the expressed SURFIN protein to its transcript pointing to a novel type of regulation, inedited in Plasmodium."
