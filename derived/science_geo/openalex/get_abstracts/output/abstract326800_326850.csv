https://openalex.org/W1986584375,"Large-scale convection over the warm tropical oceans provides an important portion of the driving energy for the general circulation of the atmosphere. Analysis of regional associations between ocean temperature, surface wind divergence, and convection produced two important results. First, over broad regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in excess of 27.5 degrees C are required for large-scale deep convection to occur. However, SSTs above that temperature are not a sufficient condition for convection and further increases in SST appear to have little effect on the intensity of convection. Second, when SSTs are above 27.5 degrees C, surface wind divergence is closely associated with the presence or absence of deep convection. Although this result could have been expected, it was also found that areas of persistent divergent surface flow coincide with regions where convection appears to be consistently suppressed even when SSTs are above 27.5 degrees C. Thus changes in atmospheric stability caused by remotely forced changes in subsidence aloft may play a major role in regulating convection over warm tropical oceans."

This realization has broad implications for many fields of science. Basic developments in the field of chaotic dynamics of dissipative systems are reviewed in this article. Topics covered include strange attractors, how chaos comes about with variation of a system parameter, universality, fractal basin boundaries and their effect on predictability, and applications to physical systems."
https://openalex.org/W2019509561,"Faceted dendrites of icosahedral AL(6)Li(3)Cu have been studied by high-resolution x-ray scattering. The samples display long-range icosahedral symmetry both in their diffraction patterns and in their macroscopic morphology. Despite the appearance of well-defined facets, the samples have a high degree of atomic disorder. The Bragg peaks have symmetry-dependent shapes and widths that scale linearly with G perpendicular (phason momentum). The peak widths are surprisingly similar to those found in icosahedral Al-Mn-Si alloys in both their absolute magnitude and their dependence on G perpendicular. The origin of these features in models for the icosahedral phase is discussed."

Of 132 isolates, 20 (six genera) showed some degree of inhibitory activity against 12 assay microorganisms. Inhibition was most frequent and most pronounced against terrestrial and marine-occurring yeasts."
https://openalex.org/W2123367019,Studies on presumably isogenic ad-3A and ad-3B mutants of the ascomycete Neurospora crassa derived from the same wild-type strain have revealed that the negative heterokaryon tests shown by certain pairwise combinations can be attributed to interaction of incompatibility factor mutations.
https://openalex.org/W2068828475,"A decrease in delay of cleavage, when irradiated sperm fom Arbacia punctulata were allowed to ""recover"" inside eggs, occurred when cell division was interrupted by the removal of oxygen soon after fertilization. The recovery mechanisms in irradiated eggs of this species before and after fertilization have been compared and appear to differ."
https://openalex.org/W2093174772,"During a period of 17 days, 2 months after termination of the Russian nuclear test series in 1961, iodine-131 was measured in milk. Within 2 days after the study was begun, the herd on pasture showed 270 pc iodine-131 per liter of milk. This concentration decreased with a half-life of 7 +/- 1 days. No iodine-131 was found in the milk from sheltered cows that consumed stored feed."
https://openalex.org/W2076507297,"Instillation of four to six drops of 3-percent saline in the leaf trap of Dionaea muscipula Ellis causes the appearance of a series of spontaneous action potentials. Mechanical stimulation of the sensitive leaf hair elicits only a single response. Immersion in 3-percent, but not in 1-percent, saline effects a loss of weight in Dionaea but not in the leaves of gardenia or geranium."
https://openalex.org/W2046938133,A geometry is described which permits four-lead electrical determinations of the pressure coefficient of resistance of metals in Bridgman anvils. It is also possible in this geometry to mount more than one sample aild to make independent measurements on each sample simultaneously.

Under the proper conditions, the illusion is seen while the moon's position remains essentially unaltered. By this means, evidence is adduced in favor of Ptolemy's apparent-distance hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W1965726851,"The first meeting of the Entomological Society of America was opened on Wednesday evening, December 30th, by President Philip P. Calvert in the large lecture room of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences for the giving of the Annual Public Address. The speaker of the evening was Professor Stephen Alfred Forbes of the University of Illinois. His subject was, “Ecological Foundations of Applied Entomology.” In compliance with the request of the Executive Committee at the Atlanta meeting, Dr. Henry Skinner of the Phildelphia Academy of Natural Sciences presented a “History of the Entomological Society of America.” In addition to the history of the Society, Dr. Skinner showed pictures of many of the pioneer entomologists of America. The slides were prepared from photographs, of which the American Entomological Socieety has the largest collection in America. The speakers were greeted by a large and enthusiastic audience. After the completion of the addresses, the audience adjourned to the Library of the Academy, where the local entomologists entertained the visitors at a smoker. The exceptionally large number of visiting entomologists and the large number of persons in and about Philadelphia interested in collecting and studying insects, made it a great opportunity for the meeting of friends and acquaintances. It was pronounced by all a most enjoyable evening."
