https://openalex.org/W1969394201,"Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been recognized as a signaling molecule as well as a cytoprotectant. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) are well-known as H(2)S-producing enzymes. We recently demonstrated that 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) produces H(2)S in the brain and in vascular endothelium. However, the cellular distribution and regulation of these enzymes are not well understood. Here we show that 3MST and CAT are localized to retinal neurons and that the production of H(2)S is regulated by Ca(2+); H(2)S, in turn, regulates Ca(2+) influx into photoreceptor cells by activating vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). We also show that H(2)S protects retinal neurons from light-induced degeneration. The excessive levels of light exposure deteriorated photoreceptor cells and increased the number of TUNEL- and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)-positive cells. Degeneration was greatly suppressed in the retina of mice administered with NaHS, a donor of H(2)S. The present study provides a new insight into the regulation of H(2)S production and the modulation of the retinal transmission by H(2)S. It also shows a cytoprotective effect of H(2)S on retinal neurons and provides a basis for the therapeutic target for retinal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2009579074,"The gene FKBP5 codes for FKBP51, a co-chaperone protein of the Hsp90 complex that increases with age. Through its association with Hsp90, FKBP51 regulates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FKBP5 gene associate with increased recurrence of depressive episodes, increased susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, attempt of suicide, and major depressive disorder in HIV patients. Variation in one of these SNPs correlates with increased levels of FKBP51. FKBP51 is also increased in HIV patients. Moreover, increases in FKBP51 in the amygdala produce an anxiety phenotype in mice. Therefore, we tested the behavioral consequences of FKBP5 deletion in aged mice. Similar to that of naïve animals treated with classical antidepressants FKBP5−/− mice showed antidepressant behavior without affecting cognition and other basic motor functions. Reduced corticosterone levels following stress accompanied these observed effects on depression. Age-dependent anxiety was also modulated by FKBP5 deletion. Therefore, drug discovery efforts focused on depleting FKBP51 levels may yield novel antidepressant therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2051560487,"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis and closely related members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex continues to affect humans and animals worldwide and its control requires vaccination of wildlife reservoir species such as Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa). Vaccination efforts for TB control in wildlife have been based primarily on oral live BCG formulations. However, this is the first report of the use of oral inactivated vaccines for controlling TB in wildlife. In this study, four groups of 5 wild boar each were vaccinated with inactivated M. bovis by the oral and intramuscular routes, vaccinated with oral BCG or left unvaccinated as controls. All groups were later challenged with a field strain of M. bovis. The results of the IFN-gamma response, serum antibody levels, M. bovis culture, TB lesion scores, and the expression of C3 and MUT genes were compared between these four groups. The results suggested that vaccination with heat-inactivated M. bovis or BCG protect wild boar from TB. These results also encouraged testing combinations of BCG and inactivated M. bovis to vaccinate wild boar against TB. Vaccine formulations using heat-inactivated M. bovis for TB control in wildlife would have the advantage of being environmentally safe and more stable under field conditions when compared to live BCG vaccines. The antibody response and MUT expression levels can help differentiating between vaccinated and infected wild boar and as correlates of protective response in vaccinated animals. These results suggest that vaccine studies in free-living wild boar are now possible to reveal the full potential of protecting against TB using oral M. bovis inactivated and BCG vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1982655905,"Site-specific GalNAc-type O-glycosylation is emerging as an important co-regulator of proprotein convertase (PC) processing of proteins. PC processing is crucial in regulating many fundamental biological pathways and O-glycans in or immediately adjacent to processing sites may affect recognition and function of PCs. Thus, we previously demonstrated that deficiency in site-specific O-glycosylation in a PC site of the fibroblast growth factor, FGF23, resulted in marked reduction in secretion of active unprocessed FGF23, which cause familial tumoral calcinosis and hyperostosis hyperphosphatemia. GalNAc-type O-glycosylation is found on serine and threonine amino acids and up to 20 distinct polypeptide GalNAc transferases catalyze the first addition of GalNAc to proteins making this step the most complex and differentially regulated steps in protein glycosylation. There is no reliable prediction model for O-glycosylation especially of isolated sites, but serine and to a lesser extent threonine residues are frequently found adjacent to PC processing sites. In the present study we used in vitro enzyme assays and ex vivo cell models to systematically address the boundaries of the region within site-specific O-glycosylation affect PC processing. The results demonstrate that O-glycans within at least ±3 residues of the RXXR furin cleavage site may affect PC processing suggesting that site-specific O-glycosylation is a major co-regulator of PC processing.

Nine subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (PCSKs; PC1/3, PC2, furin, PC4, PC5/6, PACE4, PC7, SKI-1/S1P, and PCSK9) are known to regulate this process in a cell-type and protein-specific manner. The PCSKs are synthesized as inactive zymogens and undergo proteolytic processing to generate a heterodimer of an inhibitory prosegment with the remaining molecule. As they travel through the secretory pathway they sort to subcellular compartments where the optimal pH and calcium concentration will induce a secondary autocatalytic in trans cleavage that liberates the inhibitory prosegment and allows limited proteolysis of proprotein substrates. Furin and PC5/6B localize to the trans-Golgi network and cycle to the cell surface in recycling endosomes, whereas PC5/6A and PACE4 are either bound to the cell surface via heparin sulfate proteoglycans or are secreted in the extracellular matrix. In contrast, PC1/3 and PC2 reside in secretory granules where they process polypeptide hormones and proteins within the regulated secretory pathway (1Seidah N.G. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Seven of the nine PCs cleave proprotein substrates C-terminal of a polybasic consensus cleavage motif ((K/R)-(X)n-(K/R), where n = 0, 2, 4, or 6). Furin has been the most extensively studied PC and its stringent specificity for the RXXR motif relies on a large negatively charged catalytic pocket as evidenced from crystallization studies (3Henrich S.

More recently, site-specific O-glycosylation in or immediately adjacent to PC-cleavage sites is emerging as another important co-regulator of PC-mediated processing. Originally, tissue-specific processing of pro-opiomelanocortin was suggested to be related to O-glycosylation at Thr45 (8Birch N.P. Estivariz F.E. Bennett H.P. Loh Y.P.

More recently, we demonstrated that deficient O-glycosylation of the threonine residue in the RTHR179 PC-processing site of FGF23 is the cause of the rare human disease, familial tumoral calcinosis (11Kato K. Jeanneau C. Tarp M.A. Benet-Pagès A. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Strom T.M. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18370-18377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Moreover, O-glycosylation immediately C-terminal to the processing site in ANGPTL3 (RAPR224-TT) was found to regulate processing and was possibly related to regulation of serum lipids (12Gram Schjoldager K.T. Vester-Christensen M.B. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Schwientek T. Yin W. Blixt O. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36293-36303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Other studies have also indicated that O-glycans in close proximity to PC-processing sites may affect cleavage (13Semenov A.G. Postnikov A.B. Tamm N.N. Seferian K.R. Karpova N.S. Bloshchitsyna M.N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 910-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies all point to a regulatory role of site-specific O-glycosylation by the large family of GalNAc transferases, which provides a co-regulatory system with a high degree of differential regulation through the many isoforms. Here, we have systematically addressed the question of the spatial range of the influence of O-glycans on furin processing. We used a comprehensive set of in vitro peptide assays and an ex vivo cell model where O-glycosylation can be manipulated to demonstrate that O-glycans within at least ±3 residues (P7–P3′) of the RXXR PC-processing site can inhibit cleavage. Bioinformatics analysis of secreted proteins further demonstrated prevalence for Ser and Thr residues in or immediately adjacent to many putative PC-processing sites suggesting a much wider regulatory role of O-glycosylation in PC processing. A series of 20-mer synthetic peptides (Schafer-N, Sigma) were designed with a central furin RXXR sequon processing site and a “walk” of potential O-glycosylation sites (Table 1, Fig. 1). Recombinant glycosyltransferases were expressed as soluble secreted truncated proteins in insect cells and purified as described previously (15Tarp M.A. S⊘rensen A.L. Mandel U. Paulsen H. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Selection of suitable GalNAc transferases for site-specific O-glycosylation of peptides were performed in product development assays in 25 μl of 25 mm cacodylic acid sodium, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm UDP-GalNAc (Sigma), 10 μg of acceptor peptides, and 0.5 μg of purified enzyme at 37 °C using MALDI-TOF to monitor products. Glycopeptides for further analysis were produced in reactions with a 100–200-μg scale and purified by HPLC using a KinetexTM 2.6-μm C18 100-Å LC column (100 × 2.1-mm C18 column).TABLE 1Summary of in vitro and ex vivo O-glycosylation and PC furin cleavagea 20-mer peptides containing a RXXR minimal furin cleavage motif and a walk of threonine from position P8 to P4′ (grey, underlined).b In vitro glycosylation of target sequences with GalNAc-T1, -T2, and -T3. x; full incorporation of 1 site.

Products of O-glycosylation reactions were characterized by electrospray ionization-linear ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (ESI-LIT-FT-MS) in an LTQ-Orbitrap XL hybrid spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped for electron transfer dissociation for peptide sequence analysis by MS/MS (MS2) with retention of glycan site-specific fragments. Samples were dissolved in methanol/water (1:1) containing 1% formic acid and introduced by direct infusion via a TriVersa NanoMate ESI-Chip interface (Advion BioSystems) at a flow rate of 100 nl/min and 1.4 kV spray voltage. Mass spectra were acquired in positive ion FT mode using parameters similar to previous studies (12Gram Schjoldager K.T. Vester-Christensen M.B. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Schwientek T. Yin W. Blixt O.

Electron transfer dissociation-MS2 spectra were analyzed by comparison with theoretical c and z• fragment m/z values calculated for all positional combinations of one HexNAc residue distributed on the all potential S and T glycosylation sites in the sequence. Calculations were performed using the web-based Protein Prospector MS-Product software routine. A previously described reporter construct (12Gram Schjoldager K.T. Vester-Christensen M.B. Bennett E.P.

The modified reporter construct was designed with a central 20-amino acid PC processing target sequence flanked by short spacer sequences and His tags/EYFPs in N-terminal end and 3.5 MUC1-TR/His tag in C-terminal end (Fig. 2A). A series of constructs with targeting sequences identical to those used in in vitro peptide assays (Fig. 1) were developed by in-frame insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides, encoding the respective peptide sequences, into the SacII and Bpu1102I restriction sites situated within the respective N- or C-terminal spacer sequences of the reporter construct (Fig. 2A). CHO ldlD cells with defective UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc C4-epimerase (16Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were grown in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1, v/v) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1 reporter constructs using Mirus TransIT®-CHO Transfection Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient expression was analyzed 48 h post-transfection, and stable transfectants were selected in 0.4 mg/ml of Zeocin (Invitrogen) by monitoring expression of EYFP. Further analysis by immunocytology using anti-EYFP (Living colors, Clontech), anti-HIS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-MUC1 mAbs were performed. A secondary screening strategy monitoring the secreted reporter construct by a capture ELISA was developed. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates where coated with 3 μg/ml of anti-MUC1 5E10 (15Tarp M.A. S⊘rensen A.L. Mandel U. Paulsen H. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C, and incubated in blocking buffer, pH 7.4 (PO4, Na/K, 1% Triton, 1% BSA), for 2 h at room temperature. Following the wash, wells where incubated with 100 μl of cell culture supernatant for 4 h at RT and subsequently 16 h at 4 °C. Binding of reporter constructs were detected by incubating wells with 1 μg/ml of biotinylated HMFG2 for 2.5 h at RT followed by streptavidin-HRP for 1 h at RT and visualized by incubating with TMB+ (Dako). Adding 0.5 m H2SO4 stopped the reaction and the plate was read at 450 nm. To evaluate the effects of O-glycosylation stable CHO ldlD transfectant cells were grown in medium supplemented with 0.1 mm Gal (G), 1 mm GalNAc (Gn), or a combination (G/Gn). A modification of an in vitro cleavage assay with a human furin protease (Sigma) was used to analyze furin cleavage of RXXR-Thr-GalNAc walk peptides, pro-BNP, ST6GalNAc-I, inhibin α, integrin α, and Semaphorin 3B peptides and glycopeptides (11Kato K. Jeanneau C. Tarp M.A. Benet-Pagès A. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Strom T.M. Clausen H. J. Biol.

The assay was performed in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT using 10 μg of peptide or glycopeptide substrate and 1 unit of enzyme in a total volume of 50 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and product development was evaluated after 0.5, 5, and 20 h by MALDI-TOF. CHO ldlD cells stably expressing PC target sequence reporter constructs were grown to 50% confluence in 6-well dishes, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 50, 5, 1, or 0 μm of the cell-permeable furin inhibitor Dec-RVKR-CMK (EMD Chemicals) in dimethyl sulfoxide. After 24 and 48 h of growth, cell culture supernatant was sampled and assayed by NuPAGE and Western blotting. Briefly, cell culture medium (10 μl) was separated on NuPage Novex BisTris 4–12% gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane for 60 min, followed by incubation in 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Following a wash in TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated in primary antibody (mouse anti-HIS, rabbit anti-EYFP, mouse anti-Tn-MUC1 mAb 5E5 or anti-MUC1 5E10) overnight at 4 °C (15Tarp M.A. S⊘rensen A.L. Mandel U. Paulsen H. Burchell J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate after incubation with secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Assessment of processing was performed by scanning dried membranes in a flat bed scanner (highest resolution 800 dpi) using ImageJ 1.45i software. We used the human proteome from the International Protein Index (version 3.65) (17Kersey P.J. Duarte J. Williams A. Karavidopoulou Y. Birney E. Apweiler R. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) downloaded via the European Bioinformatics Institute homepage with 86,379 sequences and first identified a predicted secretome using version 3.0 of the SignalP prediction algorithm (18Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar). Further selection was performed by combining the NN (neural network) and HMM (hidden Markov model) versions of SignalP. Subsequently, we applied the ProP prediction algorithm (19Duckert P. Brunak S. Blom N. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) to identify putative RXXR PC processing sites combined with the presence of Ser/Thr amino acids within P6–P2′ positions of the RXXR motif. To systematically explore the spatial range within which site-specific O-glycosylation can affect PC processing, we designed a series of ideal peptides with a central RXXR furin processing motif and a walk of O-glycosylation sites (Thr residues) from P8 to P4′ (Table 1). Because there is little knowledge of conformational requirements for efficient substrates for either furin processing or GalNAc-T O-glycosylation, we designed an arbitrary set of related peptide sequences with a high degree of sequence and amino acid similarity and with use of small, uncharged residues (Ala, Gly, Pro, and Thr, except for the necessary Arg residues). The use of similar sequence design was expected to result in similar rates and efficiencies of furin digestion. To ensure efficient enzymatic O-glycosylation Pro residues were included. We also avoided dibasic motifs in or around the RXXR motif to enhance selectivity for furin as other PCs have a preference for dibasic motifs. As predicted we were able to use three GalNAc-T isoforms to produce GalNAc glycopeptides with a single GalNAc residue attached at the appropriate Thr site in all peptide designs. Two peptides (P3 and P1′) were poor acceptors for in vitro O-glycosylation and only ∼50% incorporation of GalNAc was achieved even after prolonged assays (16 h), however, we could still use these for analysis of processing. A time course analysis of in vitro furin cleavage of each of the peptides revealed that all peptides were substrates for in vitro furin cleavage as predicted, and some variation in velocities of the reactions were observed with P2′ being the poorest substrate (not shown). Comparative analysis of furin cleavage of peptides and GalNAc glycopeptides in a time course monitored by MALDI-TOF revealed that O-glycosylation within the region from P8 to P3′ adversely affected cleavage (Table 1). Position P8 at the most N-terminal end tested partially affected cleavage, whereas the most C-terminal position P4′ tested had no effect on cleavage (Table 1 and Fig. 1). O-Glycans at positions P7 (Fig. 1B), P5 (Fig. 1C), and P2′ (Fig. 1E) (as well as P6, P3, and P1′ not shown) completely blocked cleavage, although perhaps surprisingly an O-glycan at P2 (Fig. 1D) only partially inhibited cleavage. The latter is, however, in agreement with our previous studies of PC processing of FGF23, where GalNAc at P2 in the RHTR179↓ processing site only partially inhibited cleavage in vitro (11Kato K. Jeanneau C. Tarp M.A. Benet-Pagès A. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Strom T.M. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18370-18377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Importantly, an extended O-glycan structure with α2,6-linked sialic acid provided complete block of processing. In our in vitro analysis, we limited studies to the simple GalNAc O-glycan because our ex vivo cell model provides information of the effect of extended O-glycans as described below. The results are summarized in Table 1. We next proceeded with analysis of PC processing of a selection of the peptide sequences tested by the in vitro assay (including the most N- and C-terminal sites and sites most proximal to the cleavage site) in the CHO ldlD cell system where capacity for O-glycosylation can be modulated by addition of exogenous Gal and GalNAc sugars (20Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 4335-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We used a modification of a previously described chimeric reporter construct that facilitates rapid selection of stable clones as well as screening of processing and analysis of the influence of O-glycosylation (Fig. 2A) (12Gram Schjoldager K.T. Vester-Christensen M.B. Bennett E.P. Levery S.B. Schwientek T. Yin W. Blixt O. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36293-36303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We initially analyzed glycosylation and processing of the reporter constructs by transient expression, but found that both glycosylation and processing of secreted products were quite incomplete so we used stable clones for all studies reported (Fig. 2B). Processing efficiency of constructs was assessed by mobility shifts using the ratio of cleaved (N-terminal) and uncleaved fragments produced by cells grown without (37/50-kDa bands) and with the capacity for O-glycosylation (37–38/62-kDa bands). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2B the in vitro furin cleavage assay results correlated well with ex vivo processing of the corresponding reporter constructs in CHO cells. All reporter constructs were cleaved completely or partially without O-glycosylation. With O-glycosylation processing, constructs P5, P1′, and P2′ were virtually abrogated, whereas processing of the P8 and P2 constructs was partially abrogated in agreement with the in vitro assay result. In contrast, O-glycosylation of construct P4′ did not block processing. There were no substantial differences in processing of constructs glycosylated with simple GalNAcα (cells grown in GalNAc alone) or glycosylated with sialylated core 1 (NeuAcα2,3Galβ1–3[±NeuAcα2,6]GalNAcα) O-glycans (cells grown in Gal/GalNAc) (Fig. 2B). The reporter system allows assessment of O-glycosylation by large shifts in mobility (pro-apoprotein ∼50 kDa and pro-glycoprotein ∼62 kDa) due to the C-terminal MUC1 tandem repeat sequence with multiple O-glycosylation sites. O-Glycosylation of the PC processing target region can also be identified by mobility shifts of the cleaved N-terminal fragment (N-terminal apoprotein ∼37 kDa and glycoprotein 38 kDa) when glycosylation is at P1–P8, whereas determination of glycosylation in positions P1′–P4′ requires further analysis. The O-glycosylation capacity of CHO ldlD cells, i.e. the repertoire of GalNAc-Ts expressed, is not known. However, a recent study reported expression analysis of GalNAc-Ts in the parent CHO-K1 cell line (21Xu X. Nagarajan H. Lewis N.E. Pan S. Cai Z. Liu X. Chen W. Xie M. Wang W. Hammond S. Andersen M.R.

Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), which is likely to be similar to CHO ldlD. Only GalNAc-T2, -T7, -T11, and -T19 were expressed in K1. In agreement with this, we previously showed that glycosylation sites specific for the GalNAc-T3/T6 subfamily, including, e.g. the FGF23 PC-processing site, are not glycosylated by the endogenous GalNAc-Ts expressed in both CHO-K1 and ldlD cells (11Kato K.

Although we could not directly confirm glycosylation of the P1′–P4′ constructs by mobility shifts, the finding that constructs P1′–P3′ exhibited complete or partial blocking of processing is in accord with efficient glycosylation of the target sequences. Most PCs prefer cleavage at dibasic sequences, whereas furin exhibits rather strict specificity for RX(R/K)R but accepts RXXR. We therefore, as mentioned earlier, designed peptides and reporter constructs with cleavage sequence RXXR, with X = Pro, Ala, and Thr, only to ensure the absence of a dibasic motif, and thus excluding activity of other PCs that may be expressed in CHO cells. To further confirm that furin or furin-like activities were responsible for the observed processing we tested the effect of addition of the cell permeable furin-like protease inhibitor Dec-RVKR-CMK on processing in CHO ldlD cells. Cleavage of all tested reporter walk constructs (P8, P2, P2′, and P4′) was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with almost complete inhibition at 5 μm (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the PC target sequences are processed by furin-like convertases in CHO ldlD. The convertases PACE4 and PC5/6, with similar substrate specificities as furin, are also inhibited by Dec-RVKR-CMK, but PACE4 is not believed to be expressed in CHO-K1 (22Gordon V.M. Rehemtulla A.

To probe the potential for co-regulation of PC processing by site-specific O-glycosylation we surveyed potential O-glycosylation sites in RXXR furin-like processing sites by searching the human proteins with signal sequences for occurrences of Ser/Thr residues within the P8–P5′ RXXR sequons (Fig. 4A). A high prevalence of Ser residues at P7–P5, P3, and P1–2′ were found, as well as less prevalent Pro at P6 and P2, and Thr even less prevalent at P6-5, 3, and P1–2′. Although there is no good prediction algorithm for single O-glycosylation sites these findings suggest that O-glycosylation around PC processing sites may be rather common. The analysis allowing Ser/Thr at P6–P2′ revealed 710 proteins with 1,264 RXXR sequons having Ser/Thr within P6–P2′, and further narrowing down the allowed positions for Ser/Thr residues reduced the number as shown in Fig. 4B. Analysis of the list of identified proteins reveals a wide range of all major protein classes known to undergo PC processing (Fig. 4C). From the bioinformatics analysis we selected 11 functionally diverse proteins for in vitro analysis of O-glycosylation and furin processing (Table 2). FGF23 and ANGPTL3 identified previously (11Kato K. Jeanneau C. Tarp M.A. Benet-Pagès A. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Strom T.M. Clausen H. J. Biol.

Both cytokines activate STAT3, a member of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family of transcription factors. Through transcriptional regulation of its target genes, STAT3 controls a wide range of cellular processes, including cellular proliferation, oncogenesis, and cancer metastasis. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in cell migration. Elevated levels of fascin expression are found in many metastatic cancers, and inhibition of fascin function by small chemical compounds leads to a block of tumor metastasis. In this work, we demonstrate that fascin is a direct STAT3 target gene in response to OSM and IL-6 in both mouse and human breast cancer cells. We show that NFκB also binds to the fascin promoter in response to cytokine treatment and this binding is STAT3-dependent. Both STAT3 and NFκB are required for the cytokine-induced expression of fascin in cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that STAT3, in directly controlling fascin expression, is both necessary and sufficient for breast cancer cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2000884155,"Recent studies have implicated enhanced Nox2-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) by microglia in the pathogenesis of motor neuron death observed in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this context, ALS mutant forms of SOD1 enhance Rac1 activation, leading to increased Nox2-dependent microglial ROS production and neuron cell death in mice. It remains unclear if other genetic mutations that cause ALS also function through similar Nox-dependent pathways to enhance ROS-mediate motor neuron death. In the present study, we sought to understand whether alsin, which is mutated in an inherited juvenile form of ALS, functionally converges on Rac1-dependent pathways acted upon by SOD1G93A to regulate Nox-dependent ROS production. Our studies demonstrate that glial cell expression of SOD1G93A or wild type alsin induces ROS production, Rac1 activation, secretion of TNFα, and activation of NFκB, leading to decreased motor neuron survival in co-culture. Interestingly, coexpression of alsin, or shRNA against Nox2, with SOD1G93A in glial cells attenuated these proinflammatory indicators and protected motor neurons in co-culture, although shRNAs against Nox1 and Nox4 had little effect. SOD1G93A expression dramatically enhanced TNFα-mediated endosomal ROS in glial cells in a Rac1-dependent manner and alsin overexpression inhibited SOD1G93A-induced endosomal ROS and Rac1 activation. SOD1G93A expression enhanced recruitment of alsin to the endomembrane compartment in glial cells, suggesting that these two proteins act to modulate Nox2-dependent endosomal ROS and proinflammatory signals that modulate NFκB.

IntroductionAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal degenerative neurological disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 2Goodall E.F. Morrison K.E. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of ALS patients have onset of disease between 40 and 50 years of age and about 50% of patients die within 3 years. The majority of ALS cases are categorized as sporadic with no family history of disease. In this context, the causative genes and environmental factors that initiate the disease process remain poorly defined. Only ∼10% of ALS cases have a clearly inherited genetic component and hence are classified as familial ALS (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 2Goodall E.F. Morrison K.E. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The best-characterized forms of familial ALS include those caused by mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) 2The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseROSreactive oxygen speciesH2HFFdihydro-2′,4,5,6,7,7′-hexafluorofluoresceinDHEdihydroethidiumhESChuman embryonic stem cells. (3Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. et al.Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5442) Google Scholar). Approximately 20% of familial ALS cases are caused by a variety of dominant SOD1 mutations (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 3Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. et al.Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5442) Google Scholar). There remains great uncertainty as to the primary mechanism(s) by which mutant SOD1 leads to pathology observed in ALS (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 4Glass C.K. Saijo K. Winner B. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Cell. 2010; 140: 918-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Proposed mechanisms include toxicity associated with misfolding of mutant SOD1, such as ER stress and inhibition of the proteasome, enhanced proinflammatory ROS production, altered axonal transport, excitotoxicity caused by glutamate mishandling, and mitochondrial damage (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 4Glass C.K. Saijo K. Winner B. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Cell. 2010; 140: 918-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Relevant to the studies in this report are findings demonstrating that SOD1 mutations induce NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production in microglia of SOD1G93A mice leading to motor neuron death (5Marden J.J. Harraz M.M. Williams A.J. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2913-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Wu D.C. Ré D.B. Nagai M. Ischiropoulos H. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that deletion of the Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase, and to a lesser extent also the Nox1 isoform, can prolong survival in SOD1G93A transgenic mice. The importance of SOD1 in regulating cellular ROS production was first revealed by studies demonstrating that SOD1 can directly associate with endosomal Rac1 to regulate its activity (7Harraz M.M. Marden J.J. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Williams A. Sharov V.S. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Schöneich C. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 659-670PubMed Google Scholar). Rac1 is an essential activator of several NADPH oxidases and SOD1 binding to Rac1 slows the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Rac1 in a redox-dependent manner. Thus, SOD1 association with Rac1 is proposed to be a redox-dependent sensor for regulating redox-active NADPH oxidase containing endosomes (called redoxosomes) (7Harraz M.M. Marden J.J. Zhou W.

Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Redoxosomes are important signaling endosomes that regulate proinflammatory receptor signals in a redox-dependent manner through NADPH oxidases (8Oakley F.D. Abbott D. Li Q. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Li Q. Zhang Y. Marden J.J. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F. Biochem.

Biol. 2006; 26: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Redoxosomes are a subpopulation of early endosomes that produce ROS and have been shown to contain early endosomal markers (Rab5 and EEA1), redox effectors (Nox2 or Nox1, Rac1, p47phox, p67phox, and SOD1), and certainly ligand-activated cytokine receptors (TNFR1 or IL-1R1) (8Oakley F.D.

Biol. 2006; 26: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ROS produced by the redoxosome facilitate the redox-dependent recruitment of TRAFs to TNFR1 and IL-1R1 and in this manner facilitate proinflammatory signaling such as NFκB activation (8Oakley F.D. Abbott D. Li Q. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Li Q. Zhang Y. Marden J.J. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F. Biochem.

Interestingly, mutant forms of SOD1 have enhanced redox-independent binding to Rac1 and this has been proposed as a mechanism for enhanced ROS production in microglia of ALS mice (7Harraz M.M. Marden J.J. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Williams A. Sharov V.S. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Schöneich C. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 659-670PubMed Google Scholar, 12Carter B.J. Anklesaria P. Choi S. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1569-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Seven known NADPH oxidase catalytic subunits exist (Nox1, Nox2gp91phox, Nox3, Nox4, Nox5, Duox1, and Duox2) (13Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 14Hordijk P.L. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The most widely characterized of these is phagocytic gp91phox (also known as Nox2). Nox2 is also expressed in microglia (6Wu D.C. Ré D.B. Nagai M. Ischiropoulos H. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and a variety of other nonphagocytic cell types. Rac, a small GTPase, is an essential activator of Nox1 and -2, and along with several other subunits (p22phox, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, NoxO1, and NoxA1) can act to promote Nox complex activation in a cell type-specific fashion (13Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 14Hordijk P.L. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In certain cell systems, Rac1 has also been shown to be required for ROS production by Nox4 (15Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol.

Because NADPH oxidases (Nox) generate the O2̇̄ substrate of the SOD1 dismutation reaction (2O2̇̄ + 2H+ → H2O2 + O2), this class of Nox enzymes has recently generated considerable interest in studies of ALS.It is presently unclear if familial and sporadic forms of ALS have common or overlapping molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. A recent genomewide association study in sporadic ALS patients has begun to shed light on this topic (18Dunckley T. Huentelman M.J. Craig D.W. Pearson J.V. Szelinger S. Joshipura K. Halperin R.F.

Several genes that regulate endosomal trafficking, Rac1, and NADPH oxidases were identified in this study, including Nox4, TIAM2, IQGAP2, PTPRT, RAP1GAP, and MAGI2 (12Carter B.J. Anklesaria P.

Interestingly, the ALS2 gene product alsin, which when mutated causes juvenile ALS, has also been shown to influence endosomal trafficking and Rac1 activity (19Chandran J. Ding J. Cai H. Mol.

Stamper C. Jensen K.R. Letizia D. Hesterlee S.E. Pestronk A. Levine T. Bertorini T. Graves M.C. Mozaffar T. Jackson C.E. Bosch P. McVey A. Dick A. Barohn R. Lomen-Hoerth C. Rosenfeld J. O'connor D.T. Zhang K. Crook R. Ryberg H. Hutton M. Katz J. Simpson E.P. Mitsumoto H. Bowser R. Miller R.G. Appel S.H. Stephan D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), these findings suggest the intriguing hypothesis that alsin and SOD1 both influence the dynamics of Rac1-dependent, NADPH oxidase-mediated, ROS production by redoxosomes that may impact proinflammatory signaling in ALS. In support of this hypothesis, alsin has been shown to bind three components of the redoxosome (Rac1, Rab5, and SOD1).To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether alsin expression influences SOD1G93A-mediated ROS production by glial cells. Three NADPH oxidases were evaluated as sources of cellular ROS (Nox1, -2, and -4) using shRNA knockdown, based on their association with disease severity in ALS models. Findings from our studies demonstrated that wild type alsin attenuates SOD1G93A-mediated Rac1 activation, ROS production by Nox2, NFκB activation, and TNFα secretion by glial cells and protects neurons from toxicity in co-culture studies. SOD1G93A expression enhanced TNFα-dependent redoxosomal ROS production by Nox2 and this was attenuated by alsin expression. Taken together, our results suggest a potential role for alsin in regulating redox-dependent proinflammatory signals via redoxosomes that are enhanced by SOD1G93A.DISCUSSIONEnhanced ROS production has been proposed to be an important pathophysiologic component for several types of neuronal degenerative diseases including ALS (4Glass C.K. Saijo K. Winner B. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Cell. 2010; 140: 918-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). This is perhaps not surprising because most neuronal degenerative diseases have significant components of inflammation. The challenge in understanding the importance of enhanced ROS production in ALS has been to determine whether primary defects in ROS regulation incite pathophysiologic events responsible for disease progression. The first report to implicate Nox2 as a source of altered ROS production in a FALS (SOD1G93A) mouse model, described by Wu and colleagues (6Wu D.C. Ré D.B. Nagai M. Ischiropoulos H. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), was later substantiated by others (5Marden J.J. Harraz M.M. Williams A.J. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2913-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additionally, work using hESC differentiated into astrocytes demonstrated that expression of SOD1G37R-induced Nox2 protein production and ROS-mediated killing of hESC-derived motor neurons in co-culture (36Marchetto M.C. Muotri A.R. Mu Y. Smith A.M. Cezar G.G. Gage F.H. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 649-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Importantly, inhibition of Nox2 with apocynin rescued motor neuron survival in the presence of SOD1G37R-expressing astrocytes (36Marchetto M.C. Muotri A.R. Mu Y. Smith A.M. Cezar G.G. Gage F.H. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 649-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These in vitro studies by Marchetto and colleagues (36Marchetto M.C. Muotri A.R. Mu Y. Smith A.M. Cezar G.G. Gage F.H. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 649-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) were key to demonstrating that Nox2 plays an important intrinsic role within FALS astrocytes to cause paracrine killing of motor neurons. Together with the finding that SOD1 ALS mutants can also directly regulate Rac1 and Nox2-dependent ROS production, these findings point to dysregulation of NADPH oxidases as an important potential mechanism in the pathology observed in FALS.Studies have also demonstrated that Nox2 is up-regulated in spinal cord microglia of sporadic ALS patients (6Wu D.C. Ré D.B. Nagai M. Ischiropoulos H. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mechanisms of enhanced ROS production through NADPH oxidases may not be limited to SOD1 mutations found in FALS. The potential involvement of NADPH oxidases in FALS disease progression is supported by genomewide association studies demonstrating that Nox4 and several Nox regulators are closely linked to the disease (12Carter B.J. Anklesaria P. Choi S. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1569-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Dunckley T. Huentelman M.J. Craig D.W. Pearson J.V. Szelinger S.

Rosenfeld J. O'connor D.T. Zhang K. Crook R. Ryberg H. Hutton M. Katz J. Simpson E.P. Mitsumoto H. Bowser R. Miller R.G. Appel S.H. Stephan D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies on the juvenile form of ALS caused by mutations in the ALS2 gene encoding for alsin (22Yang Y. Hentati A. Deng H.X. Dabbagh O. Sasaki T. Hirano M. Hung W.Y. Ouahchi K. Yan J. Azim A.C. Cole N. Gascon G. Yagmour A. Ben-Hamida M. Pericak-Vance M. Hentati F. Siddique T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that alsin regulates Rac1 activity (21Hadano S. Kunita R. Otomo A. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Ikeda J.E. Neurochem. Int. 2007; 51: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Topp J.D. Gray N.W. Gerard R.D. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24612-24623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Kunita R. Otomo A. Mizumura H. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Hadano S. Ikeda J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16599-16611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and thus also has the potential to regulate NADPH oxidases that require Rac1 (i.e. Nox1, -2, and -4). These findings suggest that multiple independent ALS disease-causing and disease-associated genes may converge on regulatory pathways that influence NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production. In the present study, we sought to determine whether both SOD1G93A and alsin may both regulate the activity of NADPH oxidases in glial cells and the effect of this regulation on neuronal survival.As previously reported for SOD1G37R-expressing astrocytes (36Marchetto M.C. Muotri A.R. Mu Y. Smith A.M. Cezar G.G. Gage F.H. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 649-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), our studies demonstrate that SOD1G93A-expressing glial cells hyperactivate Rac1- and Nox2-dependent ROS production leading to an enhanced proinflammatory state (TNFα and NFκB) and toxicity of a motor neuron-like cell line in co-culture. Nox1 and Nox4 appeared not to play a major role in these processes. The ability of SOD1G93A to activate Rac1 is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that SOD1 binds Rac1-GTP and reduces the rate of GTP hydrolysis and that mutant forms of SOD1 have a higher affinity for Rac1-GTP (7Harraz M.M. Marden J.J. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Williams A. Sharov V.S. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Schöneich C. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 659-670PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of full-length wild type alsin together with SOD1G93A in glial cells led to protection of neuronal cells in co-culture by decreasing proinflammatory activation of glial cells (i.e. Rac1 activation, Nox2-dependent ROS production, TNFα production, and NFκB activation). These findings suggest that alsin plays a protective role and is consistent with reports demonstrating alsin knockdown induces motor neuron cell death (20Hadano S. Otomo A. Kunita R. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Akatsuka A. Koike M. Aoki M. Uchiyama Y. Itoyama Y. Ikeda J.E. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Jacquier A. Buhler E. Schäfer M.K. Bohl D. Blanchard S. Beclin C. Haase G. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and that expression of full-length alsin protects against neurotoxicity caused by SOD1 mutations (27Kanekura K. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19247-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly the RhoGEF domain of alsin was required for this protective effect (27Kanekura K. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19247-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a finding consistent with alsin mediating protection through the Rho-GTPase Rac1.Our studies demonstrate for the first time that alsin can attenuate proinflammatory pathways regulated by Nox2 in SOD1G93A-expressing glial cells and that this effect in turn influences survival of motor neuron-like cells. Previous studies have focused on the function of alsin in motor neurons and have demonstrated similar protective effects by alsin overexpression on SOD1G93A-associated toxicity (27Kanekura K. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19247-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mechanism of alsin-mediated protection of motor neurons remains unclear, but previous studies have suggested that protection may be mediated through alsin binding to mutant SOD1 (27Kanekura K. Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Aiso S. Matsuoka M. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19247-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and/or through Rac1 modulation (28Jacquier A. Buhler E. Schäfer M.K. Bohl D. Blanchard S. Beclin C. Haase G. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our studies, demonstrating for the first time protective functions of alsin in glial cells, add to this growing body of literature. Interestingly, however, our studies also demonstrate that overexpression of alsin alone in glial cells (in the absence of SOD1G93A) also drives similar amplification of proinflammatory pathways as seen following expression of SOD1G93A alone (alsin overexpression induced Rac1, glial cell ROS, TNFα production, NFκB activation, and toxicity to motor neuron-like cells in co-culture). Thus, our findings suggest that alsin is not simply a protective modulator of SOD1G93A toxicity in glial cells, but rather that both alsin and SOD1 can act to directly regulate proinflammatory signals by glial cells.Alsin is known to localize to the endosomal compartment where it can serve as a GEF for Rab5, an early endosomal effector GTPase (19Chandran J. Ding J. Cai H. Mol. Neurobiol. 2007; 36: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Topp J.D. Gray N.W. Gerard R.D. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol.

Neurol. 2006; 60: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Alsin is also an effector of Rac1 that has been shown to control endocytic mechanisms at the cell membrane (26Kunita R. Otomo A. Mizumura H. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Hadano S. Ikeda J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16599-16611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 52Otomo A. Kunita R. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Mizumura H. Onoe K. Osuga H. Hadano S. Ikeda J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 370: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and endolysosomal trafficking (20Hadano S. Otomo A. Kunita R. Suzuki-Utsunomiya K. Akatsuka A. Koike M. Aoki M. Uchiyama Y. Itoyama Y. Ikeda J.E. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, alsin is a key regulator of endosomal dynamics. We hypothesized that alsin may regulate proinflammatory pathways through redox-active signaling endosomes (i.e. redoxosomes) known to facilitate redox-mediated activation of proinflammatory receptors such as TNFR and IL-1R (8Oakley F.D. Abbott D. Li Q. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Li Q. Spencer N.Y. Oakley F.D. Buettner G.R. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1249-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Li Q. Harraz M.M. Zhou W. Zhang L.N. Ding W. Zhang Y. Eggleston T. Yeaman C. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrating that alsin recruitment to endomembranes is enhanced by SOD1G93A expression supports its potential function on redoxosomes. The recruitment of SOD1 to redoxosomes, following TNFα or IL-1β stimulation, is important for controlling Rac1-dependent NADPH oxidase activation, redox-dependent TRAF recruitment to receptor complexes, and ultimately activation of NFκB (8Oakley F.D. Abbott D. Li Q. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our novel findings that SOD1G93A expression induces redoxosomal ROS production by TNFα, and that this ROS is attenuated by alsin overexpression, provide a mechanistic link for anti-inflammatory effects of alsin in the presence of SOD1G93A. Thus, our findings are consistent with alsin being a modulator of proinflammatory Nox2-dependent redoxosomal activation.In summary, our studies demonstrate that SOD1G93A expression in glial cells modulates proinflammatory signaling through redoxosomes in a Nox2-dependent fashion. This elevated proinflammatory state in turn leads to secreted factors that are toxic to neurons. Alsin appears to directly attenuate glial cell-dependent neurotoxicity by reducing Nox2-mediated signaling by redoxosomes. This protective effect appears to be mediated by the ability of alsin to decrease Rac1 activation in the presence of SOD1G93A. Such findings provide insights into potential common regulatory pathways controlled by NADPH oxidases that influence proinflammatory signaling and neurotoxicity in two independent genetic forms of ALS. IntroductionAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal degenerative neurological disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 2Goodall E.F. Morrison K.E. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of ALS patients have onset of disease between 40 and 50 years of age and about 50% of patients die within 3 years. The majority of ALS cases are categorized as sporadic with no family history of disease. In this context, the causative genes and environmental factors that initiate the disease process remain poorly defined. Only ∼10% of ALS cases have a clearly inherited genetic component and hence are classified as familial ALS (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 2Goodall E.F. Morrison K.E. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The best-characterized forms of familial ALS include those caused by mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) 2The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseROSreactive oxygen speciesH2HFFdihydro-2′,4,5,6,7,7′-hexafluorofluoresceinDHEdihydroethidiumhESChuman embryonic stem cells. (3Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. et al.Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5442) Google Scholar). Approximately 20% of familial ALS cases are caused by a variety of dominant SOD1 mutations (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 3Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. et al.Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5442) Google Scholar). There remains great uncertainty as to the primary mechanism(s) by which mutant SOD1 leads to pathology observed in ALS (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 4Glass C.K. Saijo K. Winner B. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Cell. 2010; 140: 918-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Proposed mechanisms include toxicity associated with misfolding of mutant SOD1, such as ER stress and inhibition of the proteasome, enhanced proinflammatory ROS production, altered axonal transport, excitotoxicity caused by glutamate mishandling, and mitochondrial damage (1Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 4Glass C.K. Saijo K. Winner B. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Cell. 2010; 140: 918-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Relevant to the studies in this report are findings demonstrating that SOD1 mutations induce NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production in microglia of SOD1G93A mice leading to motor neuron death (5Marden J.J. Harraz M.M. Williams A.J. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2913-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Wu D.C. Ré D.B. Nagai M. Ischiropoulos H. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that deletion of the Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase, and to a lesser extent also the Nox1 isoform, can prolong survival in SOD1G93A transgenic mice. The importance of SOD1 in regulating cellular ROS production was first revealed by studies demonstrating that SOD1 can directly associate with endosomal Rac1 to regulate its activity (7Harraz M.M. Marden J.J. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Williams A. Sharov V.S. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Schöneich C. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 659-670PubMed Google Scholar). Rac1 is an essential activator of several NADPH oxidases and SOD1 binding to Rac1 slows the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Rac1 in a redox-dependent manner. Thus, SOD1 association with Rac1 is proposed to be a redox-dependent sensor for regulating redox-active NADPH oxidase containing endosomes (called redoxosomes) (7Harraz M.M. Marden J.J. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Williams A. Sharov V.S. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Schöneich C. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 659-670PubMed Google Scholar, 8Oakley F.D. Abbott D. Li Q. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Redoxosomes are important signaling endosomes that regulate proinflammatory receptor signals in a redox-dependent manner through NADPH oxidases (8Oakley F.D. Abbott D. Li Q. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Li Q. Zhang Y. Marden J.J. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F. Biochem.

Biol. 2006; 26: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Redoxosomes are a subpopulation of early endosomes that produce ROS and have been shown to contain early endosomal markers (Rab5 and EEA1), redox effectors (Nox2 or Nox1, Rac1, p47phox, p67phox, and SOD1), and certainly ligand-activated cytokine receptors (TNFR1 or IL-1R1) (8Oakley F.D. Abbott D. Li Q. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Li Q. Zhang Y. Marden J.J. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F. Biochem.

Biol. 2006; 26: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ROS produced by the redoxosome facilitate the redox-dependent recruitment of TRAFs to TNFR1 and IL-1R1 and in this manner facilitate proinflammatory signaling such as NFκB activation (8Oakley F.D. Abbott D. Li Q. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1313-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Li Q. Zhang Y. Marden J.J. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F. Biochem.

Biol. 2006; 26: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutant forms of SOD1 have enhanced redox-independent binding to Rac1 and this has been proposed as a mechanism for enhanced ROS production in microglia of ALS mice (7Harraz M.M. Marden J.J. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Williams A. Sharov V.S. Nelson K. Luo M. Paulson H. Schöneich C. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 659-670PubMed Google Scholar, 12Carter B.J. Anklesaria P. Choi S. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1569-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Seven known NADPH oxidase catalytic subunits exist (Nox1, Nox2gp91phox, Nox3, Nox4, Nox5, Duox1, and Duox2) (13Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 14Hordijk P.L. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The most widely characterized of these is phagocytic gp91phox (also known as Nox2). Nox2 is also expressed in microglia (6Wu D.C. Ré D.B. Nagai M. Ischiropoulos H. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and a variety of other nonphagocytic cell types. Rac, a small GTPase, is an essential activator of Nox1 and -2, and along with several other subunits (p22phox, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, NoxO1, and NoxA1) can act to promote Nox complex activation in a cell type-specific fashion (13Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 14Hordijk P.L. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In certain cell systems, Rac1 has also been shown to be required for ROS production by Nox4 (15Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16Lee S. Gharavi N.M. Honda H. Chang I. Kim B. Jen N. Li R. Zimman A. Berliner J.A. Free Radic. Biol.

Because NADPH oxidases (Nox) generate the O2̇̄ substrate of the SOD1 dismutation reaction (2O2̇̄ + 2H+ → H2O2 + O2), this class of Nox enzymes has recently generated considerable interest in studies of ALS.It is presently unclear if familial and sporadic forms of ALS have common or overlapping molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. A recent genomewide association study in sporadic ALS patients has begun to shed light on this topic (18Dunckley T. Huentelman M.J. Craig D.W. Pearson J.V. Szelinger S. Joshipura K. Halperin R.F.

Several genes that regulate endosomal trafficking, Rac1, and NADPH oxidases were identified in this study, including Nox4, TIAM2, IQGAP2, PTPRT, RAP1GAP, and MAGI2 (12Carter B.J. Anklesaria P.

Interestingly, the ALS2 gene product alsin, which when mutated causes juvenile ALS, has also been shown to influence endosomal trafficking and Rac1 activity (19Chandran J. Ding J. Cai H. Mol.

In support of this hypothesis, alsin has been shown to bind three components of the redoxosome (Rac1, Rab5, and SOD1).To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether alsin expression influences SOD1G93A-mediated ROS production by glial cells. Three NADPH oxidases were evaluated as sources of cellular ROS (Nox1, -2, and -4) using shRNA knockdown, based on their association with disease severity in ALS models. Findings from our studies demonstrated that wild type alsin attenuates SOD1G93A-mediated Rac1 activation, ROS production by Nox2, NFκB activation, and TNFα secretion by glial cells and protects neurons from toxicity in co-culture studies. SOD1G93A expression enhanced TNFα-dependent redoxosomal ROS production by Nox2 and this was attenuated by alsin expression. Taken together, our results suggest a potential role for alsin in regulating redox-dependent proinflammatory signals via redoxosomes that are enhanced by SOD1G93A."
https://openalex.org/W2051454717,"Endoparasitoid wasps inject venom proteins with their eggs to protect them from the host immune response and ensure successful parasitism. Here we report identification of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) transcripts for both intracellular SOD1 and extracellular SOD3 in the venom apparatus of two Leptopilina species, parasitoids of Drosophila. Leptopilina SODs show sequence and structure similarity to human SODs, but phylogenetic analyses indicate that the extracellular SODs are more related to cytoplasmic vertebrate SODs than to extracellular SODs, a feature shared by predicted insect extracellular SODs. We demonstrate that L. boulardi SOD3 is indeed secreted and active as monomeric glycosylated forms in venom. Our results also evidence quantitative variation in SOD3 venom contents between closely related parasitoid species, as sod3 is 100-fold less expressed in Leptopilina heterotoma venom apparatus and no protein and SOD activity are detected in its venom. Leptopilina recombinant SOD3s as well as a mammalian SOD in vitro inhibit the Drosophila phenoloxidase activity in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that SODs may interfere with the Drosophila melanization process and, therefore, with production of cytotoxic compounds. Although the recombinant L. boulardi SOD3 quantity needed to observe this effect precludes a systemic effect of the wasp venom SOD3, it is still consistent with a local action at oviposition. This work provides the first demonstration that insect extracellular SODs are indeed secreted and active in an insect fluid and can be used as virulence factors to counteract the host immune response, a strategy largely used by bacterial and fungal pathogens but also protozoan parasites during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2123937315,"Epigenetic changes in response to external stimuli are fast emerging as common underlying causes for the pre-disposition to adult disease. Prenatal androgenization is one such model that results in reproductive and metabolic features that are present in conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We examined the effect of prenatal androgens on liver function and metabolism of adult sheep. As non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increased in PCOS we hypothesized that this, and other important liver pathways including metabolic function, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and steroid receptivity, would be affected. Pregnant ewes received vehicle control (C; n = 5) or testosterone propionate (TP; n = 9) twice weekly (100 mg; i.m) from d62-102 (gestation 147 days). In a novel treatment paradigm, a second cohort received a direct C (n = 4) or TP (20 mg; n = 7) fetal injection at d62 and d82. In adults, maternal TP exposure resulted in increased insulin secretion to glucose load (P<0.05) and the histological presence of fatty liver (P<0.05) independent of central obesity. Additionally, hepatic androgen receptor (AR; P<0.05), glucocorticoid receptor (GR; P<0.05), UDP- glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG; P<0.05) and IGF1 (P<0.01) expression were upregulated. The direct fetal intervention (C and TP) led to early fatty liver changes in all animals without differential changes in insulin secretion. Furthermore, hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was up-regulated in the fetal controls (P<0.05) and this was opposed by fetal TP (P<0.05). Hepatic estrogen receptor (ERα; P<0.05) and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4; P<0.05) were increased following fetal TP exposure. Adult liver metabolism and signaling can be altered by early exposure to sex steroids implicating epigenetic regulation of metabolic disturbances that are common in PCOS."

Bacterial pathogens use a repertoire of virulence factors, but their efficient use relies on close contact between the host and the pathogen. We have recently identified a constitutively expressed MAM7 (multivalent adhesion molecule 7), which is widely distributed in Gram-negative pathogens and enables them to establish initial contact with the host cell. Here, we describe the dissection of the MAM7 interaction with the host cell surface into two distinct binding events, involving the host protein fibronectin and the membrane phospholipid phosphatidic acid. We analyzed which domains within MAM7 and fibronectin are necessary for complex formation. We further studied phosphatidic acid binding by MAM7 using site-directed mutagenesis and liposome association assays and demonstrated that a specific distribution of basic charge on MAM7 is required for high affinity binding. Finally, we showed that fibronectin and phosphatidic acid binding to MAM7 are not mutually exclusive and that the three molecules likely assemble into a tripartite complex on the host cell surface. The ability of a pathogen to rapidly form a stable interaction with the host cell surface is key to its success.

Initial host cell binding is one of the most important steps in bacterial pathogenesis. When the invading pathogen first encounters the host, its ability to rapidly establish a high affinity interaction with eukaryotic cells is decisive for the fate of the infection. Bacterial pathogens possess a large arsenal of virulence factors (toxins and effectors) to deploy against the host upon their first encounter. The high molecular weight toxins are first secreted into the extracellular environment but need to be in the immediate vicinity of the host cell for localized high concentration of the toxins so that they can efficiently dock and translocate into the host cells. Effector proteins require direct contact between pathogen and host to be directly translocated from the bacteria into the host cell cytoplasm via type III and type IV secretion systems (1Kim Y.R.

Therefore, most virulence mechanisms require intimate contact between the host and the pathogen to successfully support infection. We recently identified a novel adhesin, MAM7 (multivalent adhesion molecule 7), which is widely distributed in Gram-negative bacteria including, but not limited to, important pathogens such as Vibrio, Yersinia, Salmonella, and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) 2The abbreviations used are: EPECenteropathogenic E. coliFnfibronectinPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinePAphosphatidic acidFnBPfibronectin binding proteinMBPmaltose binding protein. (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). MAM7 consists of a hydrophobic stretch of 44 amino acids at its N terminus, which is required for correct localization and outer membrane anchoring of the protein, followed by seven mammalian cell entry (mce) domains. Single mce domain proteins have been described previously to be important for attachment to and invasion of macrophages by mycobacteria, but the structural and molecular details of these processes remain unknown (6Chitale S.

Pasricha R. Brahmachari V. Bose M. BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 200Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). MAM7 is constitutively expressed, enabling Gram-negative pathogens to establish immediate contact with host cells upon their first encounter, which in turn can lead to up-regulation of other, pathogen- and host cell-specific adhesins and virulence factors (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Pettersson J. Nordfelth R. Dubinina E. Bergman T. Gustafsson M. Magnusson K.E.

Deletion of MAM7 from Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis lead to a delay in onset of cytotoxicity and overall decrease in cytotoxicity against host cells. Deletion of MAM7 from EPEC delayed the formation of actin pedestals, which are formed as a result of direct host cell contact (11Rosenshine I. Ruschkowski S. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Mills S.D. Finlay B.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2613-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our initial characterization of MAM7 from V. parahaemolyticus has revealed two types of host cell ligands: the protein fibronectin and the membrane phospholipid phosphatidic acid. enteropathogenic E. coli fibronectin 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine phosphatidic acid fibronectin binding protein maltose binding protein. Fibronectin (Fn) is a high molecular weight glycoprotein consisting of two subunits of ∼220 kDa, although the exact composition and molecular weight varies between different splice variants. In its soluble form, fibronectin is an abundant component of blood plasma (300 μg/ml), but it is also capable of forming fibrils, which can be integrated into the extracellular matrix or incorporated into fibrin clots (12Singh P. Carraher C. Schwarzbauer J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 397-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 13Mao Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Fibronectin also functions as a receptor for a variety of bacterial adhesins, both from Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens (14Henderson B. Nair S. Pallas J. Williams M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2011; 35: 147-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In some cases, Fn binding by bacterial adhesins leads to integrin-mediated uptake of the pathogen, making it an important factor for tissue invasion during bacterial infection (16Isberg R.R. Tran Van Nhieu G. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 17Hamburger Z.A. Brown M.S. Isberg R.R. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1999; 286: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acids (PAs) are phospholipids consisting of a glycerol backbone linked to a phosphate headgroup via C3 and two fatty acid chains via C1 and C2. Although phosphatidic acids only make up an average of 1–4% of the total phospholipid content of a cell (18Voelker D.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 543-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they play an important role as precursors for the biogenesis of other phospholipids in determining membrane curvature and as signaling molecules (19Young B.P. Shin J.J. Orij R. Chao J.T. Li S.C. Guan X.L. Khong A. Jan E. Wenk M.R. Prinz W.A. Smits G.J. Loewen C.J. Science. 2010; 329: 1085-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 20Wang X.

Traffic. 2003; 4: 162-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Several PA-binding proteins are known, including Raf-1 kinase, mTOR, and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (22Andresen B.T. Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Romero G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11993-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As such, PA is involved in the regulation of pathways covering a wide variety of cellular functions such as metabolism, trafficking, and proliferation. In this study, we dissected the interaction of the adhesin MAM7 with host cells into discrete binding events and analyzed their contribution to overall host cell binding. We analyzed MAM7 for features defining its ability to interact with fibronectin and phosphatidic acid, respectively, and defined the region of fibronectin required for its interaction with MAM7. We also studied whether MAM7 is capable of binding to fibronectin and phosphatidic acid simultaneously and found that the three molecules likely form a tripartite complex. Cloning for expression in BL21 of MAM7, MBP-MAM7 (for fluorophore labeling), and GST-MAM7 has been described elsewhere (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Constructs for GST-MAM6, -mce1–5, -mce2–6, -mce3–7 as well as GST-mce1 to -mce7 were all amplified from V. parahaemolyticus POR1 genomic DNA and cloned into the plasmid pGEX-rTEV using BamHI and NotI sites. GST-mce2 point mutants were generated by whole plasmid mutagenesis using GST-mce2 as template. GST-mce1 concatemers containing three, five, or seven mce1 domains were generated by amplifying mce 1 fragments containing the following restriction sites: BamHI/XbaI, XbaI/HindIII, HindIII/XhoI, XhoI/EcoRI, EcoRI/PstI, PstI/NcoI, and NcoI/NotI for mce1 fragments 1–7, respectively, and cloning into plasmid pGEX-rTEV. MBP-His-tagged and GST-tagged proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and glutathione-agarose beads, respectively, followed by gel filtration as described previously (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Attachment assays with live bacteria or purified labeled protein were carried out as described (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether attachment was fibronectin- and phosphatidic acid-dependent, tissue culture cells were incubated with anti-Fn antibody (50 μg/ml in PBS, Sigma) or treated with 50 μg/ml phospholipase C (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min prior to infection. For attachment of labeled protein in the absence of fibronectin, we used trypsinized cells as described previously (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To test whether bacterial attachment could be abolished using heparin, cells were preincubated with heparin at concentrations between 10–500 μm in DMEM for 30 min prior to attachment assays. A detailed protocol for pulldown assays with GST-MAM constructs and fibronectin can be found elsewhere (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Variations of this protocol included the use of proteolytic fibronectin fragments (30-kDa N-terminal heparin binding domain and 45-kDa gelatin binding domain, both from Sigma) or an additional incubation step with an equimolar amount of liposomes (30 min at 22 °C). PBS-buffered liposomes were prepared from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) or mixtures of PC and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (PA), (both Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) as described previously (25Selyunin A.S.

Liposomes in load, flowthrough, and eluate fractions were quantified using the method of Worth and Wright (26Worth H.G. Wright D.J. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were extracted with a mixture of chloroform and methanol and centrifuged, and molybdophosphoric acid (Sigma) was added to the organic phase. Samples were centrifuged, and the aqueous phase was removed. Metol and sodium bisulfate were added to reduce the organic phase, and the aqueous phase was removed again following centrifugation. The amount of phospholipid was determined by measuring absorbance at 680 nm and expressed as fraction of the amount detected in loaded fractions. 96-well plates coated with 1 μg of fibronectin per well were incubated with MAM constructs prepared in PBS at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μm at 22 °C for 1 h. Initial fluorescence and fluorescence output were measured on a plate reader (λexcitation, 485 nm; λemission, 520 nm) prior to and following three washes with PBS, respectively. Data were expressed as % bound fluorescence and corrected for values determined for MBP alone. Levels of bound protein were blotted as a function of protein concentration, and data were fit to a single-site binding model using Sigma Plot. Binding of GST and GST-mce constructs to liposomes were carried out as described in the literature (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 300 μg of liposomes containing PC alone or 1–80 mol % PA were incubated with 100 μg GST and GST-mce proteins in PBS for 1 h at 22 °C. Mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, both pellet and supernatant fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by Coomassie staining. Band intensities were determined using the gel analysis software UN-SCAN-IT (Silk Scientific, Inc.), and intensities of pellet samples (% bound) were expressed as fraction of total intensities (supernatant and pellet samples combined). Our previous studies showed that two different types of host receptors, the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and the membrane phospholipid phosphatidic acid, recognize MAM7 adhesin in vitro and contribute to attachment in vivo (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When studying MAM7 binding to cells independent of fibronectin, we observed that although no binding was detected without fibronectin after 30 min, attachment to cells would gradually take place if the incubation time was extended. We therefore performed a 3-h time course experiment looking at binding of E. coli BL21 expressing V. parahaemolyticus MAM7 on their surface (BL21-MAM7) to HeLa cells in the presence and absence of fibronectin (Fig. 1A). Attachment was compared with a negative control of BL21 expressing MAM7ΔTM, a version of MAM7 missing the N-terminal 44 amino acids containing the translocation and membrane-anchoring signal (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the presence of both host receptors, binding of BL21-MAM7 to host cells was highly efficient, with >40% of bacteria binding within the first 10 min of incubation (Fig. 1A). Full binding capacity was reached after 30 min. When binding to fibronectin was blocked with anti-fibronectin antibodies so that binding could be studied independent of the contribution of fibronectin, no bacterial attachment was observed within the first 30 min of the experiment, and the binding was the same as the negative control (Fig. 1A). However, gradual binding was observed from 40 min onwards, and close to full binding capacity was reached after 60 min. Overall, binding in the absence of fibronectin was delayed by ∼30 min. When we repeated the time course experiment using host cells that were treated with trypsin to degrade fibronectin and purified, fluorophore-labeled MAM7, we obtained similar results showing a delay in host cell binding of ∼1 h (Fig. 1B). Next, we studied the contribution of phosphatidic acid on host cells to MAM7 attachment. We performed similar time course experiments as described for fibronectin, but instead, phosphatidic acid was eliminated from the host surface by treatment with phospholipase C. In the absence of phosphatidic acid, binding of both BL21-MAM7 (Fig. 1C) and labeled MAM7 protein (Fig. 1D) was reduced to background binding for the duration of the experiment (3 h), similar to that observed with of BL21-MAM7ΔTM and MBP controls, respectively. We conclude that although both fibronectin and phosphatidic acid act as host receptor for MAM7 attachment, the contribution of fibronectin to overall binding is dispensable when more time is allowed for attachment. Although phosphatidic acid is essential for MAM7-mediated binding, fibronectin contributes by accelerating bacterial attachment. Fibronectin is a dimeric 440-kDa glycoprotein involved in many vital processes, including cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and wound healing (27Grinnell F. J. Cell Biochem. 1984; 26: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 28Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Each fibronectin molecule is composed of three types of domains denoted type I, type II, and type III repeats, which vary in terms of structural and functional properties (28Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To analyze which region of fibronectin is involved in MAM7 binding, we performed pulldown experiments with GST-MAM7 and either full-length soluble fibronectin, a 30-kDa proteolytic fragment containing the N-terminal five type I repeats (I1–5, heparin binding region I) or a 45-kDa fragment containing repeat I6, II1–2, and I7–9 (gelatin and collagen binding region, Fig. 2A). Both full-length fibronectin and the 30-kDa fragment, but not the 45-kDa fragment, were pulled down by GST-MAM7 (Fig. 2, B–D). As negative control, we used MAM1, which does not bind fibronectin (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and no interaction with the 30-kDa fragment was observed (Fig. 2E). Because the 30-kDa fragment has been shown to bind heparin (29Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Atha D.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we tested whether attachment of BL21-MAM7 to HeLa cells would be inhibited by adding heparin to the attachment assay. Although in the absence of heparin, ∼80% of bacteria attached to the host cells within 30 min, the addition of increasing concentrations (10–500 μm) of heparin from intestinal mucosa gradually blocked attachment, with only ∼40% of BL21-MAM7 remaining attached at 500 μm heparin (Fig. 2F). This demonstrates that the N-terminal region of fibronectin encompassing repeats I1–5 mediates MAM7 attachment and that early binding of bacteria could be blocked by adding the competing fibronectin ligand heparin. As described previously, full-length MAM7 can stably bind to fibronectin, whereas no binding was detected with a construct containing only the first N-terminal mce domain of MAM7 (MAM1) (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To further delineate the region of MAM7 required for fibronectin binding, we performed pulldown experiments of fibronectin with GST-tagged proteins containing all seven mce domains (MAM7) or successive truncations of mce domains from the C terminus (designated MAM6 to MAM1). Both load and eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Fibronectin was only pulled down by GST-MAM7, GST-MAM6, and GST-MAM5, whereas no appreciable interaction was observed with GST-MAM1 to -MAM4 (Fig. 3A). Affinity measurements using immobilized fibronectin and fluorophore-labeled MAM constructs showed that MBP-MAM7 bound fibronectin with a KD of 15 ± 3 μm, whereas the affinity was decreased for MBP-MAM6 (KD = 36 ± 9 μm). No interaction could be detected with either MBP-MAM1 or MBP-MAM2 (Fig. 3B). We could not determine affinities for MAM3-MAM5, as MBP-tagged constructs were unstable and selective thiol labeling is unfeasible with GST-tagged proteins (GST itself contains cysteines). To determine whether one mce domain specifically was responsible for mediating the interaction with fibronectin, we used GST constructs of all seven individual mce domains for pulldown experiments. Individual mce domains were folded autonomously into a mixed α/β structure, as determined by NMR. 3A. M. Krachler, L. Zhang, K. H. Gardner, and K. Orth, unpublished observation. This approach showed that none of the single mce domains was bound by fibronectin (Fig. 3C). However, several constructs containing stretches of five mce domains (mce1–5, mce3–6, and mce 2–7) efficiently interacted with fibronectin in pulldown assays (Fig. 3D). These data support the idea that all mce domains contributed to binding, but at least five domains in tandem were required to achieve detectable binding affinity. To further test this, we constructed concatemers containing three, five, or seven identical mce1 domains and analyzed their interaction with fibronectin using pulldowns. Concatemers containing five or seven mce1 domains, but not the concatemer containing three mce1 domains, were able to pull down fibronectin (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, in principle, all mce domains can contribute to fibronectin binding, but at least five domains together are required to achieve a high affinity interaction. As described above, phosphatidic acid is essential for stable binding of MAM7 to host cells. Although we had shown previously that MAM1 is sufficient to bind to phosphatidic acid, it was unclear how the other mce domains contributed to phosphatidic acid binding in the absence of fibronectin. We tested all seven individual mce domains (mce1–mce7) for phosphatidic acid binding using liposome association assays. Proteins were incubated with liposomes containing a mixture of PC and increasing amounts (1–80 mol %) of PA, followed by separation of liposome-bound and unbound fractions by ultracentrifugation. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1) followed by densitometry (Fig. 4A). In contrast to GST alone, which did not bind liposomes and was only found in supernatants (supplemental Fig. S1H), all seven mce domains were bound by PA-containing liposomes. However, we observed significant differences in their apparent affinities: although mce1, -2, -3, and -4 bound equally well, binding was decreased ∼6-fold for mce5, ∼20-fold for mce7, and >100-fold for mce6 (Fig. 4A). Although so far only few phosphatidic acid binding proteins have been characterized in detail, it has been demonstrated that basic residues are often key determinants of binding affinity (30Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 31Lu B. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17420-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When we analyzed the mce domains of MAM7 for overall charge, we found only minor differences between individual domains. When we looked at charge distribution, however, we observed that several basic residues that are otherwise well conserved between individual domains are mutated in mce6. These include two residues which are lysines in mce2, the strongest binding mce domain, but a serine and glutamine in mce6, respectively, and a well conserved arginine, which is replaced by a histidine in mce6 (Fig. 4D). To test whether these residues contributed to phosphatidic acid binding, we mutated the respective positions in mce6 to the amino acids of the corresponding position in mce2 (mce6 S646K, Q664K, and H703R) and tested the resulting proteins for PA binding in liposome association assays. The mce6 S664K mutant, but not the Q664K or H703R mutants, showed a significant increase in association with liposomes, changing the binding affinity of mce6 relative to high binding mce domains from 100-fold less to ∼10-fold less. (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S1, I–K). We also used liposomes containing 50 mol % PA and 50 mol % PC to perform pulldown experiments, a composition of liposomes where some degree of binding was observed with all mce constructs. GST-mce proteins were immobilized and incubated with liposomes. Bound liposomes were quantified using a molybdophosphoric acid assay. In agreement with liposome assays, these experiments also showed strong binding of liposomes to mce1, -2, -3, -4, and -7, whereas mce5 and -6 showed weaker binding (Fig. 4C). mce6 S646K displayed enhanced affinity compared with wild type mce6, whereas the other mutants had equally low affinities as mce6. Although we have dissected the individual interactions between MAM7 and fibronectin and PA, it remains unclear whether MAM7 binds to both types of receptors simultaneously or binding is mutually exclusive. To analyze whether MAM7, fibronectin, and phosphatidic acid is competitive, we performed pulldown assays with equimolar amounts of MAM7, Fn, and PA (in the form of liposomes consisting of a 1:1 mixture of PC and PA or, as negative control, PC only). First, we preincubated GST-MAM7 with liposomes, followed by incubation with fibronectin (Fig. 5, A and C). Next, we preincubated GST-MAM7 with fibronectin first and competed with liposomes (Fig. 5, B and D). For both experiments, we analyzed eluate and flow-through fractions after adding the competing molecule by SDS-PAGE to detect protein (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S2) and with a molybdophosphoric acid assay to detect liposome-containing fractions (Fig. 5, C and D). Both fibronectin and PA-containing liposomes were pulled down individually by MAM7 (Fig. 5, A–D, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Addition of an equimolar mix of both ligands also resulted in efficient pulldown of both ligands by MAM7 (Fig. 5, A–D, lane 4). As a control, we performed binding assays with liposomes containing only PC, and we did not observe binding of MAM7 to liposomes but did observe binding to fibronectin (Fig. 5, A–D, lanes 5–7). Furthermore, no binding to MAM1 was observed with fibronectin or liposomes containing PC alone but was observed with liposomes containing a 1:1 mixture of PC:PA (Fig. 5, A–D, lanes 8–10). To test for competition between fibronectin and PA binding, we also performed plate assays using fibronectin-coated plates and fluorophore-labeled MBP-MAM7. MAM7-fluorescence was measured before and after incubation with liposomes containing either PC or a mixture of PC and 80 mol % PA. Incubation with increasing concentrations of liposomes did not replace fibronectin as MAM7 ligand, so that MAM7 remained bound to the plate, and fluorescence levels did not decrease significantly (Fig. 5E). We also analyzed samples from the plate assay after incubation with liposomes containing 100 μm PA or PC only (Fig. 5E, arrow). Using the molybdophosphoric acid assay, we found that PA-containing liposomes remained associated with Fn-bound MAM7 after washing steps, whereas liposomes prepared from PC alone did not (Fig. 5F). In addition, we did not detect any associated liposomes when Fn-coated plates were preincubated with MBP tag alone (Fig. 5F). These results support the hypothesis that MAM7 can interact with both fibronectin and phosphatidic acid ligands simultaneously, forming a tripartite complex. Our previous work has identified MAM7 as a factor involved in the initial attachment of bacterial pathogens to host cells. We have also demonstrated that MAM7 expressed on the surface of non-pathogenic bacteria may be utilized as a potent inhibitor of pathogen infection in tissue culture. MAM7 is capable of binding both fibronectin and phosphatidic acid on the host cell surface, and both interactions are required for bacterial adhesion to host cells (5Krachler A.M. Ham H. Orth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11614-11619Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Upon further dissection of host cell binding into discrete binding events, either by masking fibronectin with an anti-Fn antibody or by degrading phosphatidic acid, we found that in the absence of fibronectin, MAM7 is still able to attach to host cells, but establishment of a stable interaction takes significantly longer than in the presence of fibronectin (Fig. 1). Because fibronectin is an abundant protein in the extracellular matrix surrounding cells in vivo as well as in tissue culture, we speculate that it facilitates rapid initial attachment of bacteria in the vicinity of the host cell membrane, thereby increasing the likelihood for the pathogen to establish a high affinity interaction with the host cell membrane via the second MAM7 ligand, phosphatidic acid. We found that the MAM7 binding site in fibronectin is located to the 30-kDa N-terminal region (Fig. 2). The same region is also exploited as receptor by other bacterial adhesins, including fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) from the Gram-positive pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (15Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, future experiments will be carried out to address whether MAM7 binding to host cells might be able to diminish adhesion and invasion of these pathogens. In contrast to FnBP-expressing pathogens utilizing the 30-kDa fragment for attachment, most of the MAM7-containing pathogens we studied such as V. parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and EPEC remain extracellular during infection and are not internalized by host cells (32Burdette D.L. Seemann J. Orth K. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Simonet M. Richard S. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 841-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rosqvist R. Bölin I. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2139-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Celli J. Olivier M. Finlay B.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Equally, non-pathogenic BL21-MAM7 did not get internalized by host cells. Many factors could account for this difference in bacterial fate following fibronectin binding (36Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). FnBPs such as S. pyogenes F1 bind to fibronectin in a way that leaves the RGD motif required for integrin recruitment, which is necessary for internalization, exposed (37Ensenberger M.G. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is possible that MAM7 binding renders fibronectin in a different conformation, which does not allow for integrin recruitment. It is also possible that fibronectin does not get recruited by MAM7 at a density sufficient to induce clustering of integrin receptors and thus activation of downstream pathways necessary for cellular uptake (38Tran Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent work analyzing the link between repeats within S. aureus FnBPA and cellular invasion has shown that only very high (subnanomolar) affinity interactions between FnBP repeats and fibronectin can lead to sufficient clustering of integrin receptors to promote cellular invasion (39Edwards A.M. Potts J.R. Josefsson E. Massey R.C. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000964Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the interaction between MAM7 and fibronectin is not of high enough affinity to promote cellular uptake. The 30-kDa fragment of fibronectin also contains features required for fibronectin cross-linking and fibrin binding (40Hörmann H. Richter H. Jelini V. Wendt C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1987; 368: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 41Vakonakis I. Staunton D. Rooney L.M. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that binding of MAM7 interferes with these processes, as has been described for other adhesins interacting with the same region (42Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Kaufman N.R.

Ooi P. Baker S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14643-14652Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We are currently conducting experiments to study the consequences of MAM7 binding on integrin signaling, fibrin-fibronectin cross-linking and fibrillogenesis. We detected no discernible binding with MAM constructs containing one to three mce domains, possibly due to very low affinity, and only weak binding with four mce domains. We found that at least five mce domains are required for stable binding of MAM to fibronectin. The sharp increase in binding affinity between four and five mce domains (Fig. 3A) as well as the non-linear increase in affinity between six and seven mce domains observed in fluorescent saturation binding experiments (Fig. 3B) is in better agreement with a cooperative rather than a linear binding model. However, a clear distinction between the two would require fibronectin binding analyses with MBP proteins containing three to five mce domains, which we currently are unable to produce and purify. Because the 30-kDa region required for MAM binding contains five consecutive type I repeats, it is tempting to speculate that each of these repeats binds to one mce domain. However, determination of the exact stoichiometry of binding will be subject to further studies but might be difficult to determine in the context of lipid binding, which could modulate the affinity and stoichiometry of binding between MAM7 and fibronectin. In contrast to fibronectin, which seems to contribute to fast binding but is dispensable for high affinity binding, phosphatidic acid is indispensable to establish stable binding of MAM7 to the host surface (Fig. 1, C and D). This underlines earlier findings showing that the relative binding affinity of MAM7 for fibronectin is relatively minor compared with its affinity for intact host cells (apparent KD of 15 μm and 200 nm for fibronectin and intact cells, respectively). No common motif mediating interactions between proteins and phosphatidic acid has been identified to date. However, many PA binding motifs contain a high number of basic residues which are thought to establish electrostatic interactions with the phosphate headgroup (31Lu B. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17420-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on alignments of individual mce domains within MAM7 and their differences in affinity for PA, we determined at least one basic residue (mce2 Lys-166), which is crucial for PA binding. The position is well conserved between different mce domains in MAM7 with the exception of mce6 and mce5, both of which bound PA with lower affinity than other mce domains. Mutation of this position to a lysine in mce6 lead to at least 20-fold increased affinity for PA. Mutation of other candidate residues (which were conserved as basic residues in the other mce domains) within mce6, we mutated to basic residues did not seem to have any effect on PA binding. Ultimately, structural studies on mce domains in their free and ligand-bound forms will be required to shed more light on the detailed mechanisms behind host cell binding. In this study, we dissected the interaction of the adhesin MAM7 with host cells into discrete binding events and analyzed their contribution to overall host cell binding. We analyzed MAM7 for features defining its ability to interact with fibronectin and phosphatidic acid, respectively, and defined the region of fibronectin required for its interaction with MAM7. We also studied whether MAM7 is capable of binding to fibronectin and phosphatidic acid simultaneously and found that the three molecules likely form a tripartite complex. These studies form an important basis for our current and future efforts to develop MAM7-derived tools for the attenuation of Gram-negative bacterial infections.

With structures of individual BAM proteins available to supplement functional studies, one can start to piece together how the BAM complex forms. Previous research has shown that the POTRA motifs of BamA interact with the BamB–E lipoproteins, and it is believed that the POTRA motifs are also the docking site for the unfolded OMP substrates (3Hagan C.L. Silhavy T.J. Kahne D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10Kim S. Malinverni J.C. Sliz P. Silhavy T.J. Harrison S.C. Kahne D. Science. 2007; 317: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although BamB and BamD independently interact with the POTRA motifs directly, BamC and BamE require BamD to co-purify with BamA (6Malinverni J.C. Werner J. Kim S. Sklar J.G. Kahne D. Misra R. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Kim S. Malinverni J.C. Sliz P. Silhavy T.J. Harrison S.C. Kahne D. Science. 2007; 317: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between BamC and BamD has also been shown, and the mutagenesis data are consistent with the C terminus of BamD (residues 227–245) being necessary for the association (6Malinverni J.C. Werner J. Kim S. Sklar J.G. Kahne D. Misra R. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the region of BamC involved in the interaction with BamD was not determined. To gain insight into the nature of the BamC-BamD interaction, a series of BamC truncation mutations were made and screened for interaction with BamD. This resulting in vitro interaction data, along with the crystal structure, reveal that the long, unstructured N terminus of BamC is required to stabilize the BamCD complex by forming a lasso-like structure that binds to BamD. The DNAs coding for the full-length BamC and BamD constructs and the truncation mutants (BamCNC, BamCN, BamCC, and BamCUN) were amplified from E. coli K12 using the primers listed in supplemental Table 1. All forward and reverse primers contained the restriction sites NdeI and XhoI, respectively (except for BamCNC, which had NdeI and HindIII). The PCR products of full-length BamC, full-length BamD, and BamCNC were ligated into vector pET28a (Novagen), and the resulting constructs had cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tags. The PCR products of BamCN, BamCC, and BamCUN were ligated into pET24a (Novagen), resulting in C-terminal hex-histidine tags. Subsequent DNA sequencing (Macrogen) confirmed that the BamC and BamD inserts matched the sequences reported in the Swiss-Prot Database (P0A903 and P0AC02, respectively). Each expression plasmid coding for BamC, BamD, BamCNC, BamCN, BamCC, or BamCUN was transformed into E. coli BL21(λDE3) cells and used to inoculate (1:100 back-dilution) 2 liters of LB medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Cultures were grown at 37 °C until A600 nm = 0.6. The culture was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells overexpressing BamC and BamD were separately harvested by centrifugation and subsequently combined prior to lysis. The combined cell pellet was lysed using an Avestin EmulsiFlex-3C cell homogenizer in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl). The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the overexpressed proteins were initially purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. BamC and BamD were co-eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) with a step gradient method (100–500 mm imidazole in buffer A in 100 mm increments). The fractions containing both proteins were pooled and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml using an Amicon ultracentrifugal filter device (Millipore). The concentrated BamCD sample was then further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-100 HiPrep 26/60 column) in buffer A on an ÄKTAprime system (GE Healthcare). To test whether or not different truncation mutant forms of BamC can form a BamCD heterodimer, each truncation mutant was co-lysed with BamD and purified by Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography as described above. The oligomeric state of the purified sample was further confirmed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 column, GE Healthcare) in-line with a multiangle light-scattering system (Wyatt Technologies Inc.). A sample of 100 μl of purified sample (5 mg/ml) was injected and resolved at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in buffer A. The molecular masses of proteins in each sample were determined by a multiangle light-scattering DAWN EOS instrument with a 684 nm laser (Wyatt Technologies Inc.) coupled to a refractive index instrument (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technologies Inc.). The molar mass of the protein was calculated from the observed light-scattering intensity and differential refractive index using ASTRA v5.1 software (Wyatt Technologies Inc.) based on the Zimm fit method using a refractive index increment of dn/dc = 0.185 ml/g. BamCD crystals were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. A final v/v concentration of 0.03% n-dodecyl β-maltoside was added to the protein sample prior to setting up crystallization plates. The crystallization drops were prepared by mixing 1 μl of protein (30 mg/ml) suspended in buffer A with 1 μl of reservoir solution and then equilibrating the drop against 1 ml of reservoir solution. The BamCD construct yielded crystals in the space group I121 with unit cell dimensions of 73.8, 133.4, and 145.0 Å. The optimal crystallization reservoir condition was 0.2 m K2HPO4 and 20% PEG-3350. Crystallization was performed at room temperature (∼22 °C). The cryosolution contained 0.2 m K2HPO4, 20% PEG-3350, and 30% glycerol. Crystals were washed in the cryosolution before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on the BamCD crystals at beamline X25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source, using an ADSC Q315 CCD x-ray detector. The crystal-to-detector distance was 375 mm. A total of 360 images were collected with 1° oscillations, and each image was exposed for 1 s. The diffraction data were processed with the programs iMosflm (27Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), POINTLESS (28Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3745) Google Scholar), and SCALA (28Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3745) Google Scholar). See supplemental Table 2 for data collection statistics. Although the full-length BamCD complex was used for crystallization, BamC was cleaved to a smaller fragment corresponding to BamCUN (Asp28–Ala217) in the crystallization drop during incubation. BamC has been previously shown to be susceptible to degradation in the linker region connecting the N- and C-terminal domains (29Albrecht R. Zeth K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1586-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the program PHASER 2.1 (30McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14440) Google Scholar). Previously solved E. coli BamCN (Protein Data Bank code 2YH6) and BamD (code 2YHC) structures were used as search models (11Albrecht R. Zeth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27792-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The N-terminal unstructured region of BamC was manually fit into the difference electron density map using the program COOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). The structure was refined using restrained refinement in REFMAC5 (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar), and further manual adjustments to the atomic coordinates, especially in regions of BamD, were performed with the program COOT. The final model was obtained by running restrained refinement in REFMAC5 with TLS restraints obtained from the TLS motion determination server (33Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are shown in supplemental Table 2. Secondary structural analysis was performed with the program DSSP (34Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Métoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). The program COOT was used to overlap coordinates for structural comparison. The stereochemistry of the structure was analyzed with the program PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The on-line servers PISA (36Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar) and PROTORP (37Reynolds C. Damerell D. Jones S. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 413-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) were used to identify protein-protein interaction interfaces. The results from size exclusion chromatography and multiangle light-scattering analysis are consistent with both BamC and BamD existing in a monomeric state in solution when purified separately (supplemental Fig. 1). However, when cells overexpressing each protein were combined prior to lysis, a large population of BamC and BamD was observed to co-elute from a size exclusion column as a BamCD heterodimeric complex (Fig. 1). The molar mass of the complex was verified by multiangle light-scattering analysis (60.1 ± 1.8 kDa) (supplemental Fig. 2), which is consistent with the sum of the calculated molecular masses (64.4 kDa) of the BamC (36.4 kDa) and BamD (28.0 kDa) constructs used in this study. To determine which region of BamC is important for forming the BamCD complex, a series of BamC truncations were created and examined for their ability to interact with BamD. BamC can be divided into three domains: the unstructured region at the far N terminus of the protein (BamCU), the N-terminal domain (BamCN), and the C-terminal domain (BamCC) (13Gatzeva-Topalova P.Z. Warner L.R. Pardi A. Sousa M.C. Structure. 2010; 18: 1492-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Sandoval C.M. Baker S.L. Jansen K. Metzner S.I. Sousa M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Vanini M.M. Spisni A. Sforça M.L. Pertinhez T.A. Benedetti C.E.

Biol. 2011; 411: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The truncated forms of BamC created for this study are as follows: 1) BamCN (residues 99–217), 2) BamCC (residues 220–344), 3) BamCNC (both the N- and C-terminal domains, residues 94–344), and 4) BamCUN (the N-terminal unstructured region followed by the N-terminal domain, residues 26–217). Size exclusion chromatography analysis showed that any truncated form of BamC missing the unstructured N terminus (i.e. BamCN, BamCC, and BamCNC) was unable to form the BamCD complex (Fig. 1b and supplemental Fig. 1). On the other hand, BamCUN co-purified with BamD throughout the entire purification process despite missing the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1, c and d). Multiangle light-scattering analysis confirmed that BamCUN and BamD formed a complex with a molecular mass of 55.6 ± 1.7 kDa, which is comparable with the sum (49.9 kDa) of the molecular masses of BamCUN (21.9 kDa) and BamD (28.0 kDa) (supplemental Fig. 2). Together, these results show that the unstructured N terminus of BamC is required for the formation of the BamCD complex. Although the structures of the individual BamC and BamD monomers have been solved previously, that of the BamCD complex has not. In fact, no Bam lipoprotein complex structures have yet been solved. BamC forms two globular domains (N- and C-terminal domains) both with the “helix-grip” fold (38Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Proteins. 2001; 43: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) that are connected by a flexible linker (11Albrecht R. Zeth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27792-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Warner L.R. Varga K. Lange O.F. Baker S.L. Baker D. Sousa M.C. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the BamD structure consists of 10 α-helices that form five tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) (Fig. 2a) (11Albrecht R. Zeth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27792-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Sandoval C.M. Baker S.L. Jansen K. Metzner S.I. Sousa M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we crystallized BamD in a heterodimeric complex with BamCUN, and its structure was solved and refined to 2.9 Å resolution (supplemental Table 2). The most outstanding structural feature of the BamCD complex is the 73-residue-long unstructured N terminus of BamC that has not been observed in previously reported structures (11Albrecht R. Zeth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27792-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Warner L.R. Varga K. Lange O.F. Baker S.L. Baker D. Sousa M.C. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Knowles T.J. McClelland D.M. Rajesh S. Henderson I.R. Overduin M. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); it folds into an elongated U-shaped loop structure that interacts extensively with BamD by fitting into a trail of crevices that run along the longitudinal axis of BamD (Fig. 2b and supplemental Fig. 3). The globular N-terminal domain of BamC that follows this unstructured region lies adjacent to the N-terminal half of the BamD molecule. Although a previous study has predicted that BamC interacts with the C-terminal end of BamD (Met227–Thr245) (6Malinverni J.C. Werner J. Kim S. Sklar J.G. Kahne D. Misra R. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), our structure shows that the N-terminal region of BamD is also an important site of interaction, as BamC binds along the entire length of the BamD molecule. To determine whether the BamC and BamD molecules undergo conformational changes upon binding to and forming the stable BamCD complex, the structures of both proteins were individually compared with the previously solved structures of the monomeric form of each protein. Although the N-terminal domain structure of BamC superimposes very closely with the previously reported crystal structure (root mean square deviation of 0.54 Å) and the NMR structure (root mean square deviation of 1.24 Å) (supplemental Fig. 4), BamD in the BamCD complex shows a significantly different conformation compared with the monomeric structure (root mean square deviation of 2.3 Å). In the BamCD complex, the positions of α-helices in TPR motifs 3 (α6), 4 (α7 and α8), and 5 (α9 and α10) of BamD are shifted to better accommodate the binding of BamC (Fig. 2c). The four C-terminal α-helices of TPR motifs 4 and 5, in particular, show the greatest change in conformation. The interaction between BamC and BamD is created predominantly by the direct contact between the N-terminal unstructured region of BamC and all five TPR motifs of BamD (Fig. 2b). This interaction between the two proteins is mediated by numerous hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals forces and has an average interface area of 2249.4 Å2 (Fig. 3a and supplemental Table 3). Many conserved residues are found concentrated at the interaction interfaces on both proteins (Fig. 3, b and c), suggesting that the interaction between these two proteins has important biological and functional implications. For BamC, a multiple sequence alignment (supplemental Fig. 5) shows that its unstructured N terminus is the most well conserved region of the protein, which is not surprising considering its essential role in stabilizing the BamCD complex structure. For BamD, about half of the conserved residues are found at the BamCD interaction interface, but the other half are found clustered on the opposite side of the protein and are solvent-exposed in this heterodimeric complex (Fig. 3c and supplemental Figs. 6 and 7). Although this structural information has revealed how BamC and BamD interact with each other, the insights gained in this study raise many questions regarding the function and structure of the BAM complex. For instance, a pocket present in the N-terminal region of BamD (formed by TPR motifs 1 and 2) has been predicted to recognize and bind to the C-terminal targeting sequence of unfolded OMP substrates (11Albrecht R. Zeth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27792-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Sandoval C.M. Baker S.L. Jansen K. Metzner S.I. Sousa M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In fact, this binding pocket of BamD has been previously shown to resemble closely that of PEX5 (Protein Data Bank code 3CVP) (21Sandoval C.M. Baker S.L. Jansen K. Metzner S.I. Sousa M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Sampathkumar P. Roach C. Michels P.A. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 867-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a peroxisomal targeting signal receptor (root mean square deviation of 1.7 Å) (Fig. 4a). In the BamCD complex structure, however, this proposed binding pocket is occupied by part of the unstructured region of BamC that has no sequence similarity to the C-terminal targeting sequences of OMP substrates or to PTS1, which is a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence recognized by PEX5 (Fig. 4b). If the function of BamD is indeed recognition of OMP substrates via their C-terminal targeting sequences, then perhaps one of the roles of BamC (more specifically, the unstructured N terminus of BamC) is that of a regulatory one, where it may block or expose the targeting sequence-binding site of BamD depending on need. Many aspects of the BAM complex structure and function remain to be elucidated. How does BamD interact with the POTRA motifs of BamA? It is possible that the conserved region of BamD that is not binding to BamC may serve as a binding surface for POTRA5 of BamA. Where is the C-terminal domain of BamC positioned relative to the rest of the BamC and BamD molecules? Does the C-terminal domain of BamC also interact with BamD, or does it have a separate binding partner? Further biochemical and structural investigation of different interactions formed between the BAM proteins will be required to answer these questions. Continued progress in the structural and functional analysis of the BAM complex and its individual components will not only enhance our understanding of how β-barrel proteins assemble and insert into the outer membrane but may also ultimately contribute to the development of novel antibiotics.

https://openalex.org/W1973025982,"Numerous efforts have been made to elucidate the etiology and improve the treatment of lung cancer, but the overall five-year survival rate is still only 15%. Identification of prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer using gene expression microarrays poses a major challenge in that very few overlapping genes have been reported among different studies. To address this issue, we have performed concurrent genome-wide analyses of copy number variation and gene expression to identify genes reproducibly associated with tumorigenesis and survival in non-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma. The genomic landscape of frequent copy number variable regions (CNVRs) in at least 30% of samples was revealed, and their aberration patterns were highly similar to several studies reported previously. Further statistical analysis for genes located in the CNVRs identified 475 genes differentially expressed between tumor and normal tissues (p<10(-5)). We demonstrated the reproducibility of these genes in another lung cancer study (p = 0.0034, Fisher's exact test), and showed the concordance between copy number variations and gene expression changes by elevated Pearson correlation coefficients. Pathway analysis revealed two major dysregulated functions in lung tumorigenesis: survival regulation via AKT signaling and cytoskeleton reorganization. Further validation of these enriched pathways using three independent cohorts demonstrated effective prediction of survival. In conclusion, by integrating gene expression profiles and copy number variations, we identified genes/pathways that may serve as prognostic biomarkers for lung tumorigenesis."

P-gp exhibits extraordinary substrate and inhibitor promiscuity, resulting in a wide range of possible drug-drug interactions. Inhibitory antibodies have long been considered as a possible strategy to modulate P-gp-dependent cancer cell drug resistance, and it is widely suggested that the antibodies MRK16 and UIC2 inhibit P-gp by capturing a single isoform and preventing flux through the catalytic cycle.

Here we exploit surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to probe conformational changes associated with these intermediate states for P-gp in lipid bilayer nanodiscs. The results indicate that P-gp in nanodiscs undergoes functionally relevant ligand-dependent conformational changes and that previously described inhibitory antibodies bind to multiple nucleotide-bound states but not the ADP-VO4-trapped state, which mimics the post-hydrolysis state.

In addition to the long standing interest in P-gp as a target in cancer chemotherapy, there is great current interest in modulating P-gp function to improve the absorption, distribution, and elimination properties of many other drugs, and in particular, to improve CNS entry of drugs aimed at neurodegenerative diseases (15Jeynes B. Provias J. Neurosci. Lett. 2011; 487: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). High levels of expression of the human ABCB1 at the blood-brain barrier, intestine, and liver are consistent with its role in the protection of critical organs from chemical insult (3Leonard G.D.

In addition, P-gp is unusually substrate-promiscuous, as expected for a role in detoxification (2Jones P.M. O'Mara M.L. George A.M. Trends Biochem.

Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), indicate that the ABC transporters are complex transmembrane proteins with several conserved structural elements. P-gp consists of four core domains: two transmembrane domains, containing multiple membrane-spanning α-helices (transmembrane helices (TMHs)), which form the drug-binding sites, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which utilize the energy released in ATP binding and hydrolysis to power drug transport by an as yet undetermined mechanism (22Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Kerr I.D. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1056-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The NBDs of P-gp share a large degree of sequence identity with other ABC transporters, suggesting some commonality of mechanism. Conserved motifs that form the ATP-binding pocket within the NBDs include the Walker A and Walker B motifs, common to many nucleotide-binding proteins, as well as the ABC signature motif, the hallmark of the ABC superfamily (2Jones P.M. O'Mara M.L. George A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 520-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is clear that large scale conformational changes transmitted between the NBDs and transmembrane domains contribute to the P-gp transport mechanism. Specifically, binding of ATP induces the engagement of the two NBDs, which likely transmits conformational change to the TMHs (23Crowley E. O'Mara M.L. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 3974-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Martin C. Berridge G. Mistry P. Higgins C. Charlton P. Callaghan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11901-11906Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in the TMHs are also apparent in the quasi-stable ADP-VO4-trapped state, P-gp·ADP·VO4, which mimics the post-ATP hydrolysis state prior to the release of PO4 and ADP or the transition state leading to it (25Urbatsch I.L.

The conformations of the TMHs during the progression of nucleotide-bound NBD states, in turn, control egress of drug from the drug-binding sites.

As a result, it has been difficult to study individual steps in the transport cycle or specific protein conformations that are populated. In fact, there are competing mechanistic models that differ in the point at which drug is released (Fig. 1) (40Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 41Ambudkar S.V. Kim I.W. Sauna Z.E. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2006; 27: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that at least one nucleotide-dependent conformational change takes place, the number of conformational states during the reaction cycle, their structural differences, and whether they precede or follow drug release have not been determined. Clearly, new methods are required to further define these mechanistic details. Here purified P-gp was captured in lipid membrane nanodiscs, and the nucleotide-dependent conformations of P-gp were probed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and inhibitory antibodies. The results provide additional detail about the mechanism of inhibition by the MRK16 and UIC2 antibodies and the structure of intermediate conformations. Furthermore, the results suggest the possible conformations from which drug is released. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted and were the highest quality available. Human dodeca-histidine-tagged P-gp was expressed using a baculovirus expression system in Trichoplusia ni cells and purified via nickel affinity chromatography as described (42Ritchie T.K. Grinkova Y.V. Bayburt T.H. Denisov I.G. Zolnerciks J.K. Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 464: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). MSP1D1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using the hepta-histidine tag via nickel affinity chromatography (42Ritchie T.K. Grinkova Y.V. Bayburt T.H. Denisov I.G. Zolnerciks J.K. Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 464: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) as described. P-gp nanodisc preparations were made as described previously (42Ritchie T.K. Grinkova Y.V. Bayburt T.H. Denisov I.G. Zolnerciks J.K. Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 464: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli total lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AB) was dissolved in chloroform, dried to a lipid film under N2, and vacuum-desiccated overnight, prior to solubilization in disc-forming buffer (DFB: 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) with the addition of 4-fold excess dodecyl β-maltopyranoside (Affymetrix, Fremont, CA). Purified P-gp, MSP1D1, and lipid were combined at a molar ratio of 0.02:1:35 with the addition of protease inhibitors, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 40 μm leupeptin hemisulfate, and 1 μm pepstatin A (EMD Biosciences, Rockland, MA), and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with constant agitation. Prewashed Bio-Beads SM-2 media (Bio-Rad) were then added at 0.8 g/ml and incubated for 2 h at room temperature to remove the detergent. Resulting nanodiscs were recovered from the Bio-Beads using a 25-gauge needle. Nanodisc formation was analyzed using size exclusion chromatography, which was performed on a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) at an isocratic flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, using DFB as the mobile phase. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad) were run on the column every 6 months to monitor column status. ATPase assays were performed as described previously (42Ritchie T.K. Grinkova Y.V. Bayburt T.H. Denisov I.G. Zolnerciks J.K. Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 464: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The antibodies UIC2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and MRK16 (Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, WA) were both purchased without BSA or azide. To determine the effect of UIC2 and MRK16 on ATPase activity of P-gp, the antibodies were first buffer-exchanged out of PBS and into DFB to minimize phosphate contamination. Antibody (5 μg, or DFB as a control) was added to 500 μl of P-gp nanodiscs at ∼80 nm (∼1 μg) and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. Empty nanodiscs were also treated with antibody and DFB and used to determine the background amount of phosphate in the samples. Basal and drug (50 μm nicardipine or 10 μm nicardipine)-stimulated ATPase activity was determined using a colorimetric phosphate release assay (43Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Drugs were made up as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stocks, and vehicle was added in the basal activity. Sodium orthovanadate was prepared by boiling and adjusting the pH of the solution to 10 until the solution became colorless and the pH stabilized. Nucleotides were made up in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. For the ADP/VO4 samples, ADP was added to the ATPase buffer and mixed thoroughly prior to the addition of VO4 to prevent a local pH change, which would cause VO4 aggregation. All reactions were carried out in ATPase buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4). P-gp nanodiscs (50 nm) were incubated in ATPase buffer with in ATPase buffer with or without nucleotide (5 mm ADP, 5 mm ADP, and 5 mm Vi, or 5 mm AMPPNP) in the presence and absence of 10 μm vinblastine for 30 min at 37 °C. Dilutions of each conformation were made using the same buffer to maintain the drug, nucleotide, and/or VO4 concentrations to ensure that the drug or nucleotide was bound for the duration of the experiment. SPR experiments were performed at the University of Washington Bioanalytical Pharmacy Core on a Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare). CM5 chips and amine-coupling reagents were purchased from GE Healthcare. The antibodies were diluted into 10 mm sodium acetate buffer at the appropriate pH at a concentration of 30 μg/ml and immobilized using amine-coupling chemistry. The level of the immobilized antibody was 3000 response units, which was reached using the immobilization wizard of the Biacore T100 controller software. An activated and capped surface without antibody was used as the reference, which was subtracted from each of the flow cells containing the antibodies. For all experiments, the running buffer used was DFB, and the surface was regenerated by two 20-s injections of 10 mm glycine, pH 1.5, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. P-gp nanodiscs (0–12.5 nm) in ATPase buffer with and without drug (10 μm vinblastine) and nucleotide (5 mm AMPPNP, 5 mm ADP, or 5 mm ADP/VO4) were flowed over the immobilized antibody at a flow rate of 75 μl/min and allowed to associate for 60 s followed by a 120- or 300-s dissociation phase. Due to the lack of dissociation, only association data were fit using Prism 5 (GraphPad). The temperature of the sample chamber was maintained at 10 °C to ensure sample stability, and the chip surface temperature was kept at 25 °C. P-gp nanodiscs (30 nm) in ATPase buffer without nucleotide were captured by both antibodies by flowing over the surface at a flow rate of 75 μl/min for 60 s. After a 120-s stabilization phase, nucleotides at the same concentrations as before or ATPase buffer were flowed over the captured P-gp nanodiscs at 75 μl/min for 120 s followed by a 120-s dissociation phase. Human ABCB1 was incorporated into lipid bilayer nanodiscs as described previously using the engineered apolipoprotein scaffold MSP1D1 and E. coli total lipid extract. Although the inhibitor effects of MRK16 and UIC2 on substrate efflux from whole cells are well established, no data concerning their effects on the ATPase function have been published. It is reasonable to presume that these antibodies would also inhibit ATPase function if they capture specific P-gp conformations and prevent flux through the catalytic cycle, as widely suggested. ATPase activity was therefore determined for P-gp in nanodiscs in the presence or absence of UIC2 or MRK16. In contrast to expectations, neither antibody inhibited basal or drug-stimulated ATPase activity (Fig. 2). In fact, MRK16 slightly activated the basal and nicardipine-stimulated ATPase activity, with the major impact on the Vmax term. These data indicate that the NBDs are capable of binding and hydrolyzing ATP even in the presence of antibody and that nicardipine (or vinblastine, Km, ATP = 0.4077 ± 0.2076 mm, data not shown) binds and stimulates ATPase activity even with antibody present. MRK16 and UIC2 clearly do not prevent the NBDs from sampling conformations required for drug-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, and MRK16 actually stimulates this activity. The data are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Kinetic constants from Michaelis-Menten fit to ATPase assay in the presence and absence of antibodiesVmaxKmBasalNicardipine-stimulatedBasalNicardipine-stimulatednmol Pi/min/mg of P-gpmmDFB140.0 ± 42.6571.5 ± 64.10.964 ± 0.6320.401 ± 0.143MRK16262.2 ± 64.5688.9 ± 24.00.723 ± 0.4490.226 ± 0.030UIC2153.8 ± 62.6568.1 ± 35.80.860 ± 0.8240.413 ± 0.086 Open table in a new tab SPR was used to probe the conformations of P-gp that bind to the antibodies. Here we use the term conformation as it relates to the protein structure, which is presumably linked to varying states of occupancy by drug or nucleotide. We presume that the antibodies would distinguish between different states of ligand occupancy only if they were accompanied by changes in P-gp structure. Conversely, all ligand-bound states of P-gp that bind to the antibody are not necessarily identical. The P-gp nanodiscs were incubated, in the presence or absence of the transportable substrate vinblastine, with saturating concentrations of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP, ADP, or ADP and VO4 to obtain the well characterized and quasi-irreversible trapped state that mimics the post-hydrolysis P-gp·ADP·PO4 complex or the transition state leading to it. These P-gp nanodiscs complexes were then analyzed for binding to surface-immobilized antibodies MRK16 or UIC2 by SPR. The overall experimental design is summarized in Fig. 3, where the binding (association) of a single concentration of P-gp nanodiscs, as analyte, to immobilized antibody is shown. Both antibodies have epitopes on the extracellular surface of P-gp. Fig. 4 and the corresponding parameters in Table 2 demonstrate that the P-gp is clearly capable of binding to both antibodies in the absence of drug and in the presence of AMPPNP or ADP. The affinity and on-rates of the P-gp nanodisc particles were unaffected by the presence of vinblastine. The off-rates of the particles were too slow to measure in each case, so only the association rates are reported in Table 2. Although the off-rates were not experimentally recovered because they are too slow, the limit of the instrument, 1 × 10−5 s−1, can be used to approximate the upper limit of the Kd for each antibody to each state in Fig. 4. Attempts to fit the association data to a more complex two-component model (two binding sites with different kinetic parameters) improved the fit slightly. However, although one of the recovered on-rates from the two-component model was consistently nearly identical to the on-rate from the one-component fit, the second on-rate was dramatically slower (∼100-fold). Such slow on-rates are difficult to interpret and likely represent some nonspecific binding. The likelihood that this slow rate was due to nonspecific binding is supported by the observation that it was nearly constant across each of the nucleotide-bound states. Because the fits to the simple binding model adequately demonstrate the unique properties of the vanadate-trapped state, the results of the simpler model are reported in Table 2. The most striking result is that neither antibody binds to the ADP-VO4-trapped state, in marked contrast to the other nucleotide-bound states for which the antibodies have extremely high affinity. Apparently, in the trapped state, the conformation of the extracellular P-gp epitopes is very different from any of the other states of the catalytic cycle that are modeled here.FIGURE 4Association of P-gp nanodiscs, at various nucleotide-bound NBD states to MRK16 and UIC2.

Open table in a new tab To confirm this result, a second experimental design was used wherein P-gp nanodiscs were captured by the antibodies and ligands were then flowed across the biosensor chip surface (Fig. 5). In this case, ADP alone or AMPPNP had no effect on the response units and the affinity of the P-gp nanodiscs was not decreased. Again in marked contrast, when both ADP and VO4 were flowed across the surface, the P-gp nanodiscs rapidly dissociated from the immobilized antibody. In effect, formation of the trapped state released the P-gp nanodiscs from the antibodies. For both antibodies, the data fit best to two dissociation rates. For UIC2, the rates and fractional contributions were 0.2097 ± 0.0017 s−1 (57.6%) and 0.0178 ± 0.002 (42.4%). For MRK16, the rates and fractional contributions were 0.2247 ± 0.0014 (63.4%) and 0.0193 ± 0.0002 (46.6%). These experiments do not directly reveal the source of heterogeneous kinetics, which is likely due to heterogeneity of the nucleotide-binding sites. The results further demonstrate that the conformation of the trapped state is significantly different from the conformation in the presence of the other ligands, and neither antibody retains its affinity for this state. The antibodies are unable to prevent formation of the trapped conformation. The data summarized here demonstrate the utility of lipid nanodiscs as a platform to study conformational aspects of P-gp, which have eluded analysis by many other methods due to the difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities in well defined membrane environments. These results also clarify the mechanism of inhibition of P-gp by MRK16 and UIC2, which have been used extensively to modulate P-gp in cell-based assays and which have provided proof of principle for many years that modulation of P-gp is a reasonable strategy to increase cancer cell exposure to numerous anti-cancer drugs. Based on the lack of inhibition of the ATPase function, it is clear that these antibodies do not capture a specific conformation and prevent flux through the P-gp catalytic cycle. Their effect on the cell efflux of various drugs, combined with the results here, indicates that these antibodies uncouple the ATP hydrolysis from transport. Inasmuch as many small molecule drugs also uncouple ATP hydrolysis from transport, the antibodies MRK16 and UIC2 may inhibit by a similar mechanism. Drugs that uncouple P-gp may be trapped within the TMHs without being effluxed and prevent the efflux of other drugs, without preventing ATP hydrolysis in the NBDs. The results further suggest that the species from which vinblastine is released to the extracellular milieu is not the post-hydrolysis P-gp·ADP·PO4 state, to the extent that this state is mimicked by the vanadate-trapped species. Although some ATP-hydrolytic enzymes are covalently modified by vanadate (44Davies D.R. Hol W.G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the available data indicate that this does not occur with P-gp and that the interaction is reversible (25Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 45Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) Here we presume that the protein conformations of both ligand states P-gp·ADP·PO4 and P-gp·ADP·VO4 are nearly identical. The fast dissociation of both antibodies from the vanadate-trapped species would suggest the possibility of dissociation of vinblastine or other drugs from the structurally similar P-gp·ADP·PO4 state. In contrast, antibody bound to other states in the catalytic cycle at the extracellular epitopes would sterically block drug dissociation, although the NBDs apparently cycle through the conformations required for efficient ATP hydrolysis. An alternative possibility is that drugs do dissociate from the post-hydrolysis state, but their off-rate is sufficiently slow to not compete with the dissociation and reassociation of the antibodies at the extracellular surface. It is interesting to consider the energetic aspects of the conformational change associated with forming the trapped state. From the concentration dependence of the association of antibodies to the nucleotide-bound state other than the ADP-VO4-trapped state, a crude estimate of Kd for the antibody is 1–10 pm, which in turn corresponds to a ΔG for binding of ∼14–16 kcal/mol at 20 °C. Inasmuch as the ADP-VO4-trapped state has no measurable affinity for these antibodies, the ΔΔG between the nucleotide-bound states and the trapped state must be at least ∼14 kcal/mol. This is a remarkable energy differential, suggestive of a very large conformational change upon reaching the post-hydrolysis state prior to the release of PO4. This could reflect the transfer of exposed extracellular epitopes to a partially membrane-buried state. The conformational analysis is strikingly analogous to the results based on two-dimensional crystal analysis wherein the low resolution electron density suggests a difference in the accessibility to solvent of the drug-binding site in the trapped state, which is inaccessible, as compared with the ATP analog-bound and ADP-bound states, for which the channel is more open (46Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5769-5779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The epitopes for UIC2 and MRK16 are both discontinuous and made up of multiple extracellular loops (Fig. 6) (13Schinkel A.H. Arceci R.J. Smit J.J. Wagenaar E. Baas F. Dollé M. Tsuruo T.

Presumably, these loops must undergo conformational changes when the TMHs rearrange, as reflected in the two-dimensional structures, resulting in abolition of both epitopes at the ADP·VO4-trapped state. The electron density suggests that the channel is closed in this state. Thus the two-dimensional crystal data are consistent with the current SPR data and suggest that drug is not released from the trapped state. A surprising result of our studies is that MRK16 and UIC2 do not show differential binding to the P-gp states modeled here, in contrast to the literature that suggests that UIC2 is “conformation-specific,” whereas MRK16 is not. This difference is based on studies in whole cells where UIC2 displays increased immunoreactivity in the presence of P-gp substrates (13Schinkel A.H. Arceci R.J. Smit J.J. Wagenaar E. Baas F. Dollé M. Tsuruo T. Mechetner E.B. Roninson I.B. Borst P. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), if the ATP levels within the cell have been depleted (49Goda K. Nagy H. Mechetner E. Cianfriglia M. Szabó Jr., G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2672-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), or in mutant P-gps containing a lysine-to-methionine mutation in either of the NBD Walker A motifs, which are able to bind nucleotide but are deficient in ATP hydrolysis activity (12Mechetner E.B. Schott B. Morse B.S. Stein W.D. Druley T. Davis K.A. Tsuruo T. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). MRK16 shows no such differential immunoreactivity for any of these cases. Possibly, in steady-state efflux experiments in whole cells, P-gp states are populated that are not accessed in our studies targeted to the discrete states that mimic ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and ADP·PO4-bound states. If states other than these are differentially bound by MRK16 and UIC2, then they could elicit different effects in transport assays without detectable differences in our studies. In summary, lipid nanodiscs provide a powerful platform to probe conformation and mechanism of P-glycoprotein by methods that have been previously intractable, such as SPR. The results clarify the mechanism of inhibition of the inhibitory antibodies MRK16 and UIC2, and they suggest that some drugs are not released from P-gp into the extracellular space from the immediate post-hydrolysis state."

The angiomotin-like2 gene (amotl2) has been found in blood vessels in zebrafish embryos, but its function in angiogenesis and underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that knockdown of amotl2 in zebrafish Tg(fli1:EGFP)y1 and Tg(fli1:nEGFP)y7 transgenic embryos impairs the intersegmental vessel growth and suppresses proliferation of endothelial cells. Transplantation experiments indicate that function of amotl2 in intersegmental vessel growth is cell-autonomous. AMOTL2 knockdown in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells also inhibits cell proliferation and migration and disrupts cell polarity, ultimately interrupting the formation of vascular tube-like structures. Amotl2 promotes MAPK/ERK activation via c-Src, which is dependent on phosphorylation of tyrosine residue at position 103 but independent of the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain. Taking together, our data indicate that Amotl2 plays a pivotal role in polarity, migration and proliferation of angiogenic endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077437146,"The transmembrane protein nephrin is an essential component of slit diaphragms, the specialized cell junctions that link podocyte foot processes. Podocytes are epithelial cells that surround the glomerular capillaries in the kidney and are necessary for the organ-filtering function. Nephrin signaling complex transduces extracellular cues to the podocyte cytoskeleton and regulates podocyte shape and function. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is a required growth factor produced and secreted by podocytes. Accumulating evidence suggests a cross-talk between VEGF-A and nephrin signaling pathways. We previously showed that in vivo nephrin associates with VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), the signaling receptor for VEGF-A. In the present work, we characterized the interaction between nephrin and VEGFR2 in cultured cells and in vitro. We demonstrate that nephrin-VEGFR2 interaction is direct using mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation, GST-binding assays, and blot overlay experiments. This interaction occurs through VEGFR2 and nephrin cytoplasmic domains. Nephrin-VEGFR2 interaction is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of both cytoplasmic domains. Furthermore, the nephrin-VEGFR2 complex involves Nck and actin. VEGF-A signaling via this complex results in decreased cell size. We provide evidence that this multiprotein interaction occurs in cultured podocytes. We propose that the nephrin-VEGFR2 complex acts as a key mediator to transduce local VEGF-A signals to the podocyte actin cytoskeleton, regulating the foot process structure and glomerular filter integrity."

The essential membrane protein therefore has a high potential as target for drug screening approaches to develop antibiotics against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. However, the production of large integral membrane proteins in conventional cellular expression systems is still very challenging. Cell-free expression technologies have been optimized in recent times for the production of membrane proteins in the presence of detergents (D-CF), lipids (L-CF), or as precipitates (P-CF). We report the development of preparative scale production protocols for the MraY homologues of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in all three cell-free expression modes followed by their subsequent quality evaluation. Although both proteins can be cell-free produced at comparable high levels, their requirements for optimal expression conditions differ markedly. B. subtilus MraY was stably folded in all three expression modes and showed highest translocase activities after P-CF production followed by defined treatment with detergents. In contrast, the E. coli MraY appears to be unstable after post- or cotranslational solubilization in detergent micelles. Expression kinetics and reducing conditions were identified as optimization parameters for the quality improvement of E. coli MraY. Most remarkably, in contrast to B. subtilis MraY the E. coli MraY has to be stabilized by lipids and only the production in the L-CF mode in the presence of preformed liposomes resulted in stable and translocase active protein samples."
https://openalex.org/W2021500550,"Modification of the primary anchor positions of antigenic peptides to improve binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins is a commonly used strategy for engineering peptide-based vaccine candidates. However, such peptide modifications do not always improve antigenicity, complicating efforts to design effective vaccines for cancer and infectious disease. Here we investigated the MART-127–35 tumor antigen, for which anchor modification (replacement of the position two alanine with leucine) dramatically reduces or ablates antigenicity with a wide range of T cell clones despite significantly improving peptide binding to MHC. We found that anchor modification in the MART-127–35 antigen enhances the flexibility of both the peptide and the HLA-A*0201 molecule. Although the resulting entropic effects contribute to the improved binding of the peptide to MHC, they also negatively impact T cell receptor binding to the peptide·MHC complex. These results help explain how the “anchor-fixing” strategy fails to improve antigenicity in this case, and more generally, may be relevant for understanding the high specificity characteristic of the T cell repertoire. In addition to impacting vaccine design, modulation of peptide and MHC flexibility through changes to antigenic peptides may present an evolutionary strategy for the escape of pathogens from immune destruction.

https://openalex.org/W2044832454,"The adaptive nature of bone formation under mechanical loading is well known; however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms in vivo of mechanical loading in bone formation are not fully understood. To investigate both mechanisms at the early response against mechanotransduction in vivo, we employed a noninvasive 3-point bone bending method for mouse tibiae. It is important to investigate periosteal woven bone formation to elucidate the adaptive nature against mechanical stress. We hypothesize that cell morphological alteration at the early stage of mechanical loading is essential for bone formation in vivo.We found the significant bone formation on the bone surface subjected to change of the stress toward compression by this method. The histological analysis revealed the proliferation of periosteal cells, and we successively observed the appearance of ALP-positive osteoblasts and increase of mature BMP-2, resulting in woven bone formation in the hypertrophic area. To investigate the mechanism underlying the response to mechanical loading at the molecular level, we established an in-situ immunofluorescence imaging method to visualize molecules in these periosteal cells, and with it examined their cytoskeletal actin and nuclei and the extracellular matrix proteins produced by them. The results demonstrated that the actin cytoskeleton of the periosteal cells was disorganized, and the shapes of their nuclei were drastically changed, under the mechanical loading. Moreover, the disorganized actin cytoskeleton was reorganized after release from the load. Further, inhibition of onset of the actin remodeling blocked the proliferation of the periosteal cells.These results suggest that the structural change in cell shape via disorganization and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton played an important role in the mechanical loading-dependent proliferation of cells in the periosteum during bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2004597509,"PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC) is a growth-regulated transcriptional cofactor that activates many nuclear genes specifying mitochondrial respiratory function. Stable PRC silencing in U2OS cells results in a complex phenotype typical of mitochondrial dysfunction including abundant abnormal mitochondria, reduced respiratory subunit expression, diminished respiratory enzymes and ATP levels, and elevated lactate production. The PRC response to metabolic stress was investigated by subjecting cells to metabolic insults including treatment with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), expression of a dominant negative allele of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), and glucose deprivation. These treatments led to constitutively elevated PRC protein levels, a departure from its normal transient expression upon the initiation of cell growth. A microarray screen identified 45 genes that require PRC for their induction by CCCP. A subset of these genes specific to inflammation and cell stress was also induced by dominant negative NRF-1 and by glucose deprivation, suggesting that diverse metabolic insults converge on the same PRC-dependent inflammatory program. The PRC-dependent inflammatory response was inhibited by N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that PRC may contribute to the inflammatory microenvironment linked to oxidant signaling. The induction of this PRC-dependent program may be an early event in adaptations linked to cancer and degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2060412325,"Local translation of dendritic mRNAs plays an important role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Although several hundred putative dendritic transcripts have been identified in the hippocampus, relatively few have been verified by in situ hybridization and thus remain uncharacterized. One such transcript encodes the protein neuronatin. Neuronatin has been shown to regulate calcium levels in non-neuronal cells such as pancreatic or embryonic stem cells, but its function in mature neurons remains unclear. Here we report that neuronatin is translated in hippocampal dendrites in response to blockade of action potentials and NMDA-receptor dependent synaptic transmission by TTX and APV. Our study also reveals that neuronatin can adjust dendritic calcium levels by regulating intracellular calcium storage. We propose that neuronatin may impact synaptic plasticity by modulating dendritic calcium levels during homeostatic plasticity, thereby potentially regulating neuronal excitability, receptor trafficking, and calcium dependent signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2054352346,"How do the cullins, with conserved structures, accommodate substrate-binding proteins with distinct shapes and sizes? Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases facilitate ubiquitin transfer from E2 to the substrate, tagging the substrate for degradation. They contain substrate-binding, adaptor, cullin, and Rbx proteins. Previously, we showed that substrate-binding and Rbx proteins are flexible. This allows shortening of the E2-substrate distance for initiation of ubiquitination or increasing the distance to accommodate the polyubiquitin chain. However, the role of the cullin remained unclear. Is cullin a rigid scaffold, or is it flexible and actively assists in the ubiquitin transfer reaction? Why are there different cullins, and how do these cullins specifically facilitate ubiquitination for different substrates? To answer these questions, we performed structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations based on Cul1, Cul4A, and Cul5 crystal structures. Our results show that these three cullins are not rigid scaffolds but are flexible with conserved hinges in the N-terminal domain. However, the degrees of flexibilities are distinct among the different cullins. Of interest, Cul1 flexibility can also be changed by deletion of the long loop (which is absent in Cul4A) in the N-terminal domain, suggesting that the loop may have an allosteric functional role. In all three cases, these conformational changes increase the E2-substrate distance to a specific range to facilitate polyubiquitination, suggesting that rather than being inert scaffold proteins, cullins allosterically regulate ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2083186687,"From late mitosis to the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, ORC, CDC6, and Cdt1 form the machinery necessary to load MCM2-7 complexes onto DNA. Here, we show that SNF2H, a member of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, is recruited onto DNA replication origins in human cells in a Cdt1-dependent manner and positively regulates MCM loading. SNF2H physically interacted with Cdt1. ChIP assays indicated that SNF2H associates with replication origins specifically during the G(1) phase. Binding of SNF2H at origins was decreased by Cdt1 silencing and, conversely, enhanced by Cdt1 overexpression. Furthermore, SNF2H silencing prevented MCM loading at origins and moderately inhibited S phase progression. Although neither SNF2H overexpression nor SNF2H silencing appeared to impact rereplication induced by Cdt1 overexpression, Cdt1-induced checkpoint activation was inhibited by SNF2H silencing. Collectively, these data suggest that SNF2H may promote MCM loading at DNA replication origins via interaction with Cdt1 in human cells. Because efficient loading of excess MCM complexes is thought to be required for cells to tolerate replication stress, Cdt1- and SNF2H-mediated promotion of MCM loading may be biologically relevant for the regulation of DNA replication."

The final fraction with the greatest specific activity contained 220- and 74-kDa proteins. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence revealed that the 220- and 74-kDa proteins were apolipophorin I and apolipophorin II, respectively, indicating that the factor was apolipophorin (ApoLp). The purified ApoLp fraction showed decreased expression of S. aureus hla encoding α-hemolysin, hlb encoding β-hemolysin, saeRS, and RNAIII, which activate the expression of these hemolysin genes. Injection of an anti-ApoLp antibody into the hemolymph increased the sensitivity of silkworms to the lethal effect of S. aureus. Hog gastric mucin, a mammalian homologue of ApoLp, decreased the expression of S. aureus hla and hlb. These findings suggest that ApoLp in the silkworm hemolymph inhibits S. aureus virulence and contributes to defense against S. aureus infection and that its activity is conserved in mammalian mucin."

Since the mechanism of MCT mutability is poorly understood, the aim of this work was to provide a detailed morphological analysis of a typical mutable collagenous structure in its different mechanical states. The model studied was the compass depressor ligament (CDL) of a sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus), which was characterized in different functional states mimicking MCT mutability. Transmission electron microscopy, histochemistry, cryo-scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy, and field emission gun-environmental scanning electron microscopy were used to visualize CDLs at the micro- and nano-scales. This investigation has revealed previously unreported differences in both extracellular and cellular constituents, expanding the current knowledge of the relationship between the organization of the CDL and its mechanical state. Scanning electron microscopies in particular provided a three-dimensional overview of CDL architecture at the micro- and nano-scales, and clarified the micro-organization of the ECM components that are involved in mutability. Further evidence that the juxtaligamental cells are the effectors of these changes in mechanical properties was provided by a correlation between their cytology and the tensile state of the CDLs."
https://openalex.org/W2045296570,"Background The 14-3-3 family is comprised of highly conserved proteins that are functionally important in the maintenance of homeostasis. Their involvement with the cell cycle, their association with proto-oncogenes and oncogenes, and their abnormal expression in various tumors has linked this family of proteins to the etiology of human cancer. Mounting evidence now indicates that 14-3-3σ is a cancer suppressor gene but the roles of the other 14-3-3 isoforms and their interactions in tumorigenesis have not yet been elucidated. In our current study, we examined the expression of 14-3-3β, γ, ε, ζ, η and τ in a large series of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas to evaluate any clinical significance. Methods Tumor biopsies from 298 vulvar carcinomas were examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of 14-3-3β, γ, ε, ζ, η and τ. Statistical analyses were employed to validate any associations between the expression of any 14-3-3 isoform and clinicopathologic variables for this disease. Results High cytoplasmic levels of 14-3-3β, γ, ζ, ε and η were observed in 79%, 58%, 50%, 86% and 54% of the vulvar carcinomas analyzed, respectively, whereas a low nuclear expression of 14-3-3τ was present in 80% of these cases. The elevated cytoplasmic expression of 14-3-3β, γ, ε, ζ and η was further found to be associated with advanced disease and aggressive features of these cancers. The overexpression of cytoplasmic 14-3-3β and ε significantly correlated with a poor disease-specific survival by univariate analysis (P = 0.007 and P = 0.04, respectively). The independent prognostic significance of these factors was confirmed by multivariate analysis (P = 0.007 and P = 0.009, respectively). Conclusions We reveal for the first time that the 14-3-3β, γ, ε, ζ, η and τ isoforms may be involved in the progression of vulvar carcinomas. Furthermore, our analyses show that high cytoplasmic levels of 14-3-3β and ε independently correlate with poor disease-specific survival."

The TREX1 D201ins mutation is caused by a three-nucleotide GAT insertion mutation between nucleotides 600 and 601 resulting in the insertion of an extra aspartate at amino acid position 201. The TREX1 A124ins mutation is caused by a three-nucleotide GGC insertion mutation between nucleotides 368 and 369 resulting in the insertion of an extra alanine at position 124. The mechanism by which R114H causes TREX1 catalytic dysfunction was determined. The considerable distance of Arg-114 from the TREX1 catalytic center and its location at the dimer interface raised the possibility that this residue affects activity in the opposing protomer of the TREX1 dimer. The TREX1R114H/D201ins and TREX1R114H/A124ins compound heterodimers were prepared and the remarkable stability of the TREX1 dimer was demonstrated. The activities of TREX1 R114H-containing homodimers, heterodimers, and compound heterodimers were compared with TREX1WT using quantitative ss- and dsDNA degradation assays. The activities measured in these TREX1 R114H mutants demonstrate that Arg-114 from one TREX1 protomer participates in DNA degradation occurring in the opposing protomer. This conclusion is further substantiated in TREX1 mutant homodimers, heterodimers, and compound heterodimers containing R114A and R114K. These data help to explain the stable TREX1 dimeric structure necessary for biological function and support the observed autoimmune phenotypes.

Briefly, mutant TREX1-containing plasmids were produced using a PCR site-directed mutagenesis strategy (27Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The TREX1WT and mutant homodimer enzymes (amino acids 1–242) were produced in bacteria as N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions with a PreScission Protease recognition sequence between the MBP and TREX1. The MBP-TREX1 fusion protein was bound to an amylose resin (New England Biolabs), washed, and the TREX1 was separated from MBP with PreScission Protease (GE Biosciences). The TREX1 was collected and purified to homogeneity using phosphocellulose chromatography. To generate TREX1 heterodimers, one TREX1-containing plasmid was engineered to express MBP-TREX1 and a second to express His-NusA-TREX1. The two plasmids were co-expressed in the same bacterial cell to generate a mixture of TREX1 homodimers containing only the MBP, only the His-NusA affinity tags, and TREX1 heterodimers containing both affinity tags. The TREX1 heterodimers were separated from the homodimers by sequential chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) and amylose resins (New England Biolabs). The TREX1 heterodimers were purified by phosphocellulose chromatography. Several affinity-tagged TREX1 fusion proteins were prepared to perform dimer stability studies. The His-NusA-TREX1WT homodimer was purified by nickel affinity and MonoQ chromatography. The His-MBP-TREX1WT and His-MBP-TREX1R114H homodimers were purified by nickel affinity chromatography and collected in the flow-through from a MonoQ column. The mixture of His-NusA-TREX1WT homodimers with His-NusA-TREX1WT/His-MBP-TREX1WT heterodimers was generated by coexpression of the two affinity-tagged TREX1 fusion protein constructs and subsequent purification by nickel affinity and MonoQ chromatography. All protein concentrations were determined by A280 using molar extinction coefficients for the TREX1 protomer, ϵ = 23,950 m−1 cm−1; His-MBP-TREX1, ϵ = 90,300 m−1 cm−1; His-NusA-TREX1, ϵ = 54,890 m−1 cm−1; and the His-NusA-TREX1, His-NusA-TREX1/His-MBP-TREX1 mixture, ϵ = 63,743 m−1 cm−1.

Here we show that hMSH2-hMSH6 is strictly controlled by hMSH2 and magnesium in a complex with ADP (hMSH2(magnesium-ADP)-hMSH6). Destabilization of magnesium results in ADP release from hMSH2 that allows high affinity ATP binding by hMSH6, which then enhances ATP binding by hMSH2. Both subunits must be ATP-bound to efficiently form a stable hMSH2-hMSH6 hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp required for MMR. In the presence of magnesium, the ATP-bound sliding clamps remain on the DNA for ∼8 min. These results suggest a precise stepwise kinetic mechanism for hMSH2-hMSH6 functions that appears to mimic G protein switches, severely constrains models for MMR, and may partially explain the MSH2 allele frequency in Lynch syndrome or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2017614094,"MUC1 is efficiently delivered to the apical surface of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by transit through apical recycling endosomes, a route associated with delivery of apical proteins with glycan-dependent targeting signals. However, a role for glycans in MUC1 sorting has not been established. A key feature of MUC1 is a heavily O-glycosylated mucin-like domain with a variable number of nearly perfect tandem repeats and adjacent imperfect repeats. Metabolic labeling, cell surface biotinylation, immobilized lectins, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy were used to characterize the polarized delivery of MUC1 mutants and chimeras in MDCK cells to identify the apical targeting signal. Both the interleukin-2 receptor α subunit (Tac) and a chimera where the Tac ectodomain replaced that of MUC1 were delivered primarily to the basolateral surface. Attachment of the MUC1 mucin-like domain to the N terminus of Tac enhanced apical but not basolateral delivery when compared with Tac. Conversely, deletions within the mucin-like domain in MUC1 reduced apical but not basolateral delivery when compared with MUC1. In pull-down assays with lectins, we found a notable difference in the presence of core 1 O-glycans, but not poly-N-acetyllactosamine, in apically targeted MUC1 and chimeras when compared with Tac. Consistent with these data, we found no effect on MUC1 targeting when galectin-3, with preference for poly-N-acetyllactosamine, was depleted from polarized MDCK cells. However, we did block the apical targeting activity of the mucin-like repeats when we overexpressed CMP-Neu5Ac:GalNAc-Rα2,6-sialyltransferase-1 to block core O-glycan synthesis. The cumulative data indicate that the core-glycosylated mucin-like repeats of MUC1 constitute an apical targeting signal."
https://openalex.org/W1985658715,"Spermiogenesis is a complex and dynamic process of the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. There is a great deal that is still unknown regarding the regulatory mechanisms for the formation of the sperm flagellum. In this study, we determined that the membrane-associated RING-CH 10 (March10) gene is predominantly expressed in rat testis. We isolated two March10 isoforms encoding MARCH10a and MARCH10b, which are generated by alternative splicing. MARCH10a is a long RING finger protein, and MARCH10b is a short RING finger-less protein. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the MARCH10 proteins are specifically expressed in elongating and elongated spermatids, and the expression is absent in epididymal spermatozoa. MARCH10 immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasmic lobes as well as the principal piece and annulus of the flagella. When overexpressed in COS7 cells, MARCH10a was localized along the microtubules, whereas MARCH10b was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. An in vitro microtubule cosedimentation assay showed that MARCH10a is directly associated with microtubules. An in vitro ubiquitination assay demonstrated that the RING finger domain of MARCH10a exhibits an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity along with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2B. Moreover, MARCH10a undergoes proteasomal degradation by autoubiquitination in transfected COS7 cells, but this activity was abolished upon microtubule disassembly. These results suggest that MARCH10 is involved in spermiogenesis by regulating the formation and maintenance of the flagella in developing spermatids."
https://openalex.org/W1981086150,"Recent genome-wide analyses have revealed patterns of positive selection acting on protein-coding genes in humans and mammals. To assess whether the conclusions drawn from these analyses are valid for other vertebrates and to identify mammalian specificities, I have investigated the selective pressure acting on protein-coding genes of the puffer fishes Tetraodon and Takifugu. My results indicate that the strength of purifying selection in puffer fishes is similar to previous reports for murids but stronger in hominids, which have a smaller population size. Gene ontology analyses show that more than half of the biological processes targeted by positive selection in mammals are also targeted in puffer fishes, highlighting general patterns for vertebrates. Biological processes enriched with positively selected genes that are shared between mammals and fishes include immune and defense responses, signal transduction, regulation of transcription and several of their descendent terms. Mammalian-specific processes displaying an excess of positively selected genes are related to sensory perception and neurological processes. The comparative analyses also revealed that, for both mammals and fishes, genes encoding extracellular proteins are preferentially targeted by positive selection, indicating that adaptive evolution occurs more often in the extra-cellular environment rather than inside the cell. Moreover, I present here the first genome-wide characterization of neutrally-evolving regions of protein-coding genes. This analysis revealed an unexpectedly high proportion of genes containing both positively selected motifs and neutrally-evolving regions, uncovering a strong link between neutral evolution and positive selection. I speculate that neutrally-evolving regions are a major source of novelties screened by natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W1983305936,"Naturally acquired immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria in malaria holoendemic areas is characterized by the gradual, age-related development of protection against high-density parasitemia and clinical malaria. Animal studies, and less commonly, observations of humans with malaria, suggest that T-cell responses are important in the development and maintenance of this immunity, which is mediated primarily by antibodies that slow repeated cycles of merozoites through erythrocytes. To advance our rather limited knowledge on human T-cell immunity to blood stage malaria infection, we evaluated CD4 and CD8 T-cell effector memory subset responses to the 42 kDa C-terminal fragment of Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP142), a malaria vaccine candidate, by 49 healthy 0.5 to ≥18 year old residents of a holoendemic area in western Kenya. The proportion of individuals with peripheral blood mononuclear cell MSP142 driven IFN-γ ELISPOT responses increased from 20% (2/20) among 0.5–1 year old children to 90% (9/10) of adults ≥18 years (P = 0.01); parallel increases in the magnitude of IFN-γ responses were observed across all age groups (0.5, 1, 2, 5 and ≥18 years, P = 0.001). Less than 1% of total CD4 and CD8 T-cells from both children and adults produced IFN-γ in response to MSP142. However, adults had higher proportions of MSP142 driven IFN-γ secreting CD4 and CD8 effector memory (CD45RA− CD62L−) T-cells than children (CD4: 50.9% vs. 28.8%, P = 0.036; CD8: 52.1% vs. 18.3%, respectively P = 0.009). In contrast, MSP142 driven IFN-γ secreting naïve-like, transitional (CD45RA+ CD62L+) CD4 and CD8 cells were the predominant T-cell subset among children with significantly fewer of these cells in adults (CD4: 34.9% vs. 5.1%, P = 0.002; CD8: 47.0% vs. 20.5%, respectively, P = 0.030). These data support the concept that meaningful age-related differences exist in the quality of T-cell immunity to malaria antigens such as MSP1."
https://openalex.org/W2171898041,"The emergence of influenza viruses resistant to existing classes of antiviral drugs raises concern and there is a need for novel antiviral agents that could be used therapeutically or prophylacticaly. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) belongs to the family of C-type lectins which are important effector molecules of the innate immune system with activity against bacteria and viruses, including influenza viruses. In the present study we evaluated the potential of recombinant porcine SP-D as an antiviral agent against influenza A viruses (IAVs) in vitro. To determine the range of antiviral activity, thirty IAVs of the subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 that originated from birds, pigs and humans were selected and tested for their sensitivity to recombinant SP-D. Using these viruses it was shown by hemagglutination inhibition assay, that recombinant porcine SP-D was more potent than recombinant human SP-D and that especially higher order oligomeric forms of SP-D had the strongest antiviral activity. Porcine SP-D was active against a broad range of IAV strains and neutralized a variety of H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs, including 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Using tissue sections of ferret and human trachea, we demonstrated that recombinant porcine SP-D prevented attachment of human seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 virus to receptors on epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. It was concluded that recombinant porcine SP-D holds promise as a novel antiviral agent against influenza and further development and evaluation in vivo seems warranted."

Previously, we have found that with ATP, calpastatin domain L (CSL) and calmodulin (CaM) recover channel activity from the run-down in guinea pig cardiac myocytes. Because the potency of the CSL repriming effect was smaller than that of CaM, we hypothesized that CSL might act as a partial agonist of CaM in the channel-repriming effect. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of the competitions between CSL and CaM on channel activity and on binding in the channel. We found that CSL suppressed the channel-activating effect of CaM in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. The channel-inactivating effect of CaM seen at high concentrations of CaM, however, did not seem to be affected by CSL. In the GST pull-down assay, CSL suppressed binding of CaM to GST fusion peptides derived from C-terminal regions in a competitive manner. The inhibition of CaM binding by CSL was observed with the IQ peptide but not the PreIQ peptide, which is the CaM-binding domain in the C terminus. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that CSL competes with CaM as a partial agonist for the site in the IQ domain in the C-terminal region of the Cav1.2 channel, which may be involved in activation of the channel.

The calpain and CS complex plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, shape change, migration, and apoptosis. CS is composed of a unique leader domain (domain L) in the N-terminal and four repetitive homologous domains (domains 1–4), each of which has calpain-inhibiting activity. However, CS domain L (CSL) has no calpain-inhibiting activity (1Maki M. Takano E. Mori H. Sato A. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and its physiological role remains largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that CS or CSL reprimes activity of Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels, in a concentration-dependent manner, in cardiac myocytes using the inside-out patch clamp technique (2Hao L.Y.

Subsequent studies have further shown that the effective region of CSL is confined to a region spanning 11 amino acid residues (amino acids 54–64 in exon 5) and that CSL can bind to a fragment derived from the intracellular C-terminal region of Cav1.2 channels (4Minobe E. Hao L.Y. Saud Z.A. Xu J.J. Kameyama A. Maki M. Jewell K.K. Parr T. Bardsley R.G. Kameyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Saud Z.A.

Calmodulin (CaM) is a small (18 kDa), ubiquitous, Ca2+-binding protein that mediates Ca2+-dependent regulation of various target proteins, such as enzymes, ion channels, and transporters (6Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The activity of the Cav1.2 Ca2+ channel is controlled by Ca2+-dependent facilitation (CDF) and inactivation (CDI) (7Pate P. Mochca-Morales J. Wu Y. Zhang J.Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I. Williams B.Y.

Neuron. 2004; 41: 745-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). CaM has been suggested to serve as a Ca2+ sensor and a transducer to produce Ca2+-dependent conformation changes of the channel protein in both CDF and CDI. In the case of CDF, although another mechanism involving phosphorylation of the channels by Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase has been suggested (12Dzhura I. Wu Y. Colbran R.J. Balser J.R. Anderson M.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the activation of the kinase is also mediated by CaM. In our previous studies, we have found that CaM enhances (facilitation) and then inhibits (inactivation) channel activity of the Cav1.2 channels (in a concentration-dependent manner) in the inside-out patch mode (13Han D.Y. Minobe E. Wang W.Y. Guo F. Xu J.J. Hao L.Y. Kameyama M. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 112: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in which the channel shows no activity without CaM (i.e. run-down). Although a central role for CaM in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of Cav1.2 channels is widely accepted, the molecular basis for these effects is yet to be established. The effect of CSL on the activity of the Cav1.2 channel in the inside-out mode is small (∼30% of control activity seen in the preceding cell-attached mode), whereas that of CaM is much larger (>100% of control). This finding led us to hypothesize that CSL might act as a partial agonist of the CaM-binding site, which is involved in the repriming or facilitation of the channel. In general, a partial agonist can bind and activate a given receptor but with partial efficiency relative to a full agonist. However, the partial agonist acts as a competitive antagonist in the presence of a full agonist. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of CSL with those of CaM on Cav1.2 channels and investigated a functional relation between CSL and CaM in the inside-out patch mode in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Then we explored the binding sites of CSL and CaM on the channel using a pull-down assay with GST fusion peptides of the α1C subunit of the channel. We found that CSL regulates the channel activity in a manner consistent with a partial agonist of CaM and that the binding site locates in the IQ region of the C-terminal tail of the Cav1.2 channel. Ventricular cells were obtained from adult guinea pig hearts. Female guinea pigs (350–600 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and the aorta was cannulated under artificial respiration. The dissected heart was mounted on a Langendorff apparatus and perfused with Tyrode solution for 3 min at 37 °C, nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode solution for 5 min, Ca2+-free Tyrode solution containing collagenase (0.08 mg/ml; Yakult, Tokyo, Japan) for 9–15 min, and finally washed out with a high K+ and low Ca2+ storage solution. The left ventricular myocytes were dispersed and filtered through a stainless steel mesh (105 μm). Then isolated myocytes were treated with storage solution containing alkaline protease (Nagase NK-103 (0.03 mg/ml), Katayama (Osaka, Japan)) and DNase I (type IV (0.02 mg/ml), Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 min at 37 °C and washed twice with storage solution followed by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 3 min. The isolated cells were stored at 4 °C in storage solution until use in the experiments. Experiments were carried out after approval was received from the Committee of Animal Experimentation (Kagoshima University). Tyrode solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4. Storage solution contained 70 mm KOH, 50 mm glutamic acid, 40 mm KCl, 20 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm taurin, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.5 mm EGTA buffer, pH 7.4 (with KOH). Pipette solution contained: 50 mm BaCl2, 70 mm tetraethylammonium-Cl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.003 mm Bay K 8644, and 10 mm Hepes-CsOH buffer, pH 7.4. The basic internal solution (I.O. solution) contained 120 mm potassium aspartate, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+] = 80 nm), and 10 Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.4. Ca2+ channel activity was monitored using the patch clamp technique. The myocytes were superfused with I.O. solution. Channel activity was elicited by a depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of −70 to 0 mV for 200 ms at a rate of 0.5 Hz with a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7; List, Darmstadt, Germany). The current signals were filtered at 1–1.5 Hz and fed to a computer at a sampling rate of 3.3 kHz, where the capacity and the leakage currents were subtracted digitally. The NPo value was used to represent the channel activity, where N is the number of channels in the patch and Po is the time-averaged open state probability of the channels at each depolarizing pulse. NPo was calculated based on the equation NPo = I/i, where I was the mean current during the 5–105 ms period after the onset of the test pulses, and i was the unitary current amplitude. In each experiment, basal activity was recorded in the cell-attached mode for 2 min and then in the inside-out patch mode. Test solutions were applied by moving the patch into a small inlet of the perfusion chamber, which was connected to a microinjection system. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (number of observations). Student's t test was used to estimate the statistical significance. The coding sequence of CSL (amino acids 3–148) and calpastatin domain 1 (CSD1; amino acids 151–279) were subcloned from a human CS cDNA (sequence identical to GenBankTM accession number D16217) (14Lee W.J. Ma H. Takano E. Yang H.Q. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8437-8442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a human CaM sequence (amino acids 3–149) was cloned from HEK 293 cDNA. Eleven constructs encoding the cytoplasmic regions of α1C (see Fig. 3A) were generated by PCR based on guinea pig cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AB016287) (15Ding S. Kuroki S. Kameyama A. Yoshimura A. Kameyama M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and inserted into pGEX6p-3 (GE Healthcare) as a GST fusion peptide. The identities of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to use in experiments. Vectors were transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and bacteria were cultured to an A600 of 0.8. Expression of GST fusion peptides was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Next, bacteria were resuspended in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl). The suspension was treated with lysis buffer (Tris buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme and 5 mm DTT) for 30 min. In the case of the α1C fragments, in particular CT1 due to its limited solubility, the bacterial precipitates were treated with 1.5% n-lauroylsarcosine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min (16Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 17Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The mixture was sonicated at 50% output with an ultrasonic homogenizer, NR-50 M (Microtec Nition, Funabashi, Japan) for 1 min and 20-s rest, seven cycles. After treatment with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, the lysate was separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, and then the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) for 4 h. Bound fusion proteins were extensively washed with nominally Ca2+-free I.O. solution (pH 8.0), and GST was removed by PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. The content of purified CSL and CSD1 was estimated by the Bradford method using a protein assay kit (Pierce) and BSA (Pierce) as a standard. CaM concentration was determined by extinction coefficient at 276 nm (E276) of 0.18 (mg/ml)−1cm−1 or the Bradford method using authentic CaM (Sigma-Aldrich) as a standard. The purity of yields was confirmed by densitometry on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fusion peptides corresponding to intracellular regions of α1C at saturating concentrations (2–4 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Each peptide was incubated with CSL, CaM, or both in 100 μl of I.O. solution with 80 nm or 1 mm Ca2+ for 3 h at 4 °C with agitation. Then these reaction mixtures were washed twice with two volumes of the same buffer and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. Bound CSL/CaM and α1C peptides were resuspended in SDS sample loading buffer at 50 °C for 5 min and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R staining. Protein amounts were quantified by scanning with the Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, CA), and optical density was analyzed by Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The standard curves were generated with authentic BSA (E286 = 0.66 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1; Pierce), CaM (E276 = 0.18 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1; Sigma-Aldrich), and GST (E280 = 1.69 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1). We found that relative optical densities of the same amount of CaM and GST on the gel in reference to BSA were 0.59 and 0.80, respectively. The contents of GST fusion peptides were calculated using the standard curve for GST, assuming similar E values. Data were presented as mean ± S.E. (number of observations). Student's t test and Dunnett's test were used to estimate the statistical significance. We have hypothesized that α1C has at least two CaM binding sites: one for the facilitatory (F) and the other for the inhibitory (I) effects (13Han D.Y. Minobe E. Wang W.Y. Guo F. Xu J.J. Hao L.Y. Kameyama M. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 112: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, channel activity (A) including the overall effect of CaM would be as follows,A=Amax⋅F⋅I(0≤F,I≤1)(Eq. 1) where Amax represents the maximum value of A at F = I = 1. The effects of CaM were fitted with a modified Hill's equation,A=Amax⋅([CaM]Kdf)nf1+([CaM]Kdf)nf⋅11+([CaM]Kdi)ni(Eq. 2) where Kdf and nf denote the concentration of CaM, [CaM], producing 50% of the maximum effect and an apparent Hill's coefficient, respectively, and Kdi and ni denote [CaM] producing 50% of the inhibitory effect and an apparent Hill's coefficient, respectively. The repriming effect of CSL on Cav1.2 channel activity (A) was fitted with the following Hill's equation,A=Amax⋅α⋅([CSL]Kdl)nl1+([CSL]Kdl)nl(Eq. 3) where α is the efficacy of CSL as a partial agonist of the CaM F site, and Kdl and nl denote [CSL] producing 50% of the maximum effect and an apparent Hill's coefficient, respectively. The channel activity in the presence of both CaM and CSL was fitted with the equation,A=Amax⋅([CaM]Kdf)nf+α⋅([CSL]Kdl)nl1+([CaM]Kdf)nf+([CSL]Kdl)nl⋅11+([CaM]Kdi)ni(Eq. 4) using DeltaGraph software (Red Rock Software, Salt Lake City, UT). In the pull-down assay, bound ligand (CaM or CSL; denoted as Y) for the one-site model was expressed by the following Hill's equation,Y=Bmax⋅(X−Y)Kd +(X− Y)(Eq. 5) where Bmax is the maximum binding, X is total amount of ligand, and Kd is an apparent dissociation constant. In the case of the two-binding site model, a sum of two Hill's equations was used, assuming independent binding. The value of Y can be obtained from the solution to the cubic equation and was analyzed by the Kell Ligand program (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) (18Asmara H. Minobe E. Saud Z.A. Kameyama M. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 112: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To explore the functional regulation of the channel, we measured its activity using an electrophysiological technique (Fig. 1 shows a representative experiment). After inside-out configuration, Ca2+ channel activity was significantly diminished in 1 min (run-down; data not shown). In this experiment, test solution was applied within 1 min to prevent the complete run-down. CSL and CaM reprimed channel activity from the run-down state as described in previous studies (2Hao L.Y.

We used 10 μm CSL and 1.22 μm CaM, which were submaximum concentrations for the channel-repriming effects, together with 3 mm ATP in all of the inside-out patch experiments. ATP was necessary to induce channel activity (19Xu J.J. Hao L.Y. Kameyama A. Kameyama M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1717-C1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22O'Rourke B.

Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the previous studies, it has been reported that ATP supports channel activity by a mechanism independent of protein phosphorylation but not fully understood (22O'Rourke B. Backx P.H. Marban E. Science. 1992; 257: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Yazawa K. Kameyama A. Yasui K. Li J.M. Kameyama M. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CSL recovered channel activity at the early transient phase, lasting for about 2 min after treatment, to 29.3% of that recorded in the cell-attached mode (control) and to 2.1% of the control at the late phase (Fig. 1A, a) (20Hao L.Y. Kameyama A. Kameyama M. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The addition of CaM to a channel preactivated by CSL increased the activity only to 5.4% of the control (Fig. 1A, b), which was markedly smaller than the effect expected with CaM alone (Fig. 1B, b). After CSL wash-out, the channel activity increased to 41.3% of the control (Fig. 1A, c), suggesting that CSL had an antagonistic effect on the CaM action to reprime channel activity. In another experiment, CaM was applied to the channel first, which recovered the channel activity to 117.0% of the control (Fig. 1B, a and b), and the effect was maintained stably for longer than 10 min (19Xu J.J. Hao L.Y. Kameyama A. Kameyama M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1717-C1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Then the addition of CSL to the CaM-preactivated channel conversely suppressed channel activity to 16.5% of the control, and this effect was repeatable (Fig. 1B, c). We confirmed that the inhibitory effect of CSL on the CaM-induced channel activity was seen even in the presence of protein kinase inhibitors KN-93 and K252a (supplemental Fig. S1), excluding a possible involvement of protein kinases in the CSL effect. These results suggest that there might be a competition between CaM and CSL for the binding to some region of the channel. CSL alone has a partial repriming effect on channel activity. On the other hand, it has an inhibitory effect on channel activity in the presence of CaM. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that CSL acts as a partial agonist of the CaM-binding repriming (facilitatory) site of the channel. To examine our hypothesis, we investigated the concentration-dependent effects of CSL and CaM. First, we plotted the concentration-response curves of CSL and CaM. Channel activity was recorded in the inside-out patch mode and expressed as relative values normalized by the basal activity recorded in the preceding cell-attached mode. Fig. 2A, a, shows the [CSL]-activity relationship (open circles, n = 4–5), which was fitted by Equation 3. It was apparent that the maximum effect of CSL was 25% of the control. This result is consistent with our previous report (2Hao L.Y. Kameyama A. Kuroki S. Takano J. Takano E. Maki M. Kameyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The [CaM]-activity relationship (Fig. 2B, a, open circles, n = 4–10) had a clear bell-shaped curve. The data were fitted by Equation 2. Channel activity appeared at 0.04 μm CaM, reached 100% at 0.6 μm, and peaked at around 3 μm (∼150% of control). Further increase in CaM decreased channel activity toward null activity. These results are consistent with our previous experiments (13Han D.Y. Minobe E. Wang W.Y. Guo F. Xu J.J. Hao L.Y. Kameyama M. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 112: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Xu J.J. Hao L.Y. Kameyama A. Kameyama M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1717-C1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). From the maximum effects of CSL and CaM, the value of α was estimated as 0.14. We then examined the concentration-dependent effect of CSL on channel activity in the presence of 1.22 μm CaM (Fig. 2A, b, filled circles; n = 4–10). CSL suppressed the repriming effect of 1.22 μm CaM in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of ∼2 μm and a maximum inhibition to ∼20% of control at >5 μm. The relationship was fitted by Equation 4. These values were comparable with those obtained with either CSL or CaM alone. We also examined the concentration-dependent effect of CaM in the presence of 10 μm CSL (Fig. 2B, b, filled circles; n = 4–5). We noted that the facilitatory effect of CaM (<3 μm) was markedly suppressed, whereas the inhibitory effect did not seem to be affected. The data were fitted by Equation 4. Again, these values were not much different from those obtained with either CSL or CaM alone. The parameter values to fit the theoretical curves are summarized in Table 1. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CSL interacts with CaM as a partial agonist at the CaM-repriming site, presumably located within the Cav1.2 channel. The inhibitory effect of CSL was also seen in the whole-cell Ca2+ current recorded from intact myocytes (supplemental Fig. S2).TABLE 1Parameter values for [CSL]- and [CaM]-dependent activity of the Cav1.2 channelTest solutionAmaxKdlnlKdfnfKdini%μmμmμmCSL1770.71.6CSL with 1.22 μm CaM1300.7*1.6*0.31.4*7.43.7CaM1770.51.46.43.0CaM with 10 μm CSL2110.7*1.6*0.51.4*6.42.8 Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 3A, we prepared seven constructs of GST fusion peptides of the α1C intracellular domains: N terminus (NT), cytosolic linker between channel domains I and II (LI-II), domain II to III linker (LII-III), domain III to IV linker (LIII-IV) and three C-terminal regions, proximal (CT1), middle (CT2), and distal (CT3). Because the CT1 region contains important regulatory domains, such as the EF-hand-like Ca2+-binding motif (EF) and two CaM-binding domains (PreIQ and IQ), four constructs related to CT1 were prepared: CT1A (EF + PreIQ), CT1B (PreIQ + IQ), PreIQ, and IQ. The GST fusion peptides immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed with CaM and 1 mm Ca2+, and then bound CaM was analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). CaM bound markedly to NT and CT1 and weakly to LI-II and CT2, whereas its binding to LII-III, LIII-IV, and CT3 was minimal. Furthermore, CT1B, PreIQ, and IQ were also found to bind to CaM (example shown in Fig. 4A). Fig. 3C summarizes the pull-down assay results. CaM significantly bound to five peptides (NT, CT1, CT1B, PreIQ, and IQ; p < 0.001 compared with CaM-GST binding, n = 3–8) and weakly to three peptides (LI-II, CT2, and CT1A) although not statistically significant. On the other hand, CaM binding to LII-III, LIII-IV, and CT3 was negligible. We also confirmed that there was no binding between CSL and CaM using a GST fusion CSL peptide (Fig. 3, B and C). As reported previously (18Asmara H. Minobe E. Saud Z.A. Kameyama M. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 112: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in the absence of Ca2+ (in the presence of 5 mm EGTA), it was difficult to detect CaM binding to any GST fusion peptide (data not shown). In this study, we confirmed the report that three peptides, NT, LI-II, and CT1, interact with CaM (24Zhou H. Yu K. McCoy K.L. Lee A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29612-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), except that the binding to LI-II was weak and not statistically significant. We attempted to analyze the stoichiometry of CaM binding with these peptides in two [Ca2+] conditions, 80 nm (a resting [Ca2+] level in the myocytes) and 1 mm (a saturating [Ca2+] level). In 1 mm Ca2+, CaM binding to the three peptides was detected with a wide range of [CaM], as illustrated in Fig. 3D (upper graph). The curve-fitting analysis suggested that CaM bound to NT (open circles; n = 4–9), and to LI-II (open triangles; n = 4–5). CaM binding to CT1 was better fitted with a two-site model (open squares; n = 4–9). As a result, 1.94 mol/mol CaM (Bmax1 + Bmax2) was estimated to bind with CT1. On the other hand, as reported previously (25Xiong L. Kleerekoper Q.K. He R. Putkey J.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7070-7079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), CaM binding at 80 nm Ca2+ was much lower than at 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3D, lower graph; n = 4–10). Nevertheless, we could estimate the ranking of the Kd values: CT1 < NT < LI-II. This tendency was similar to that found at the high [Ca2+] condition (18Asmara H. Minobe E. Saud Z.A. Kameyama M. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 112: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The parameter values analyzed from the theoretical curves of CaM binding to NT, LI-II, CT1, and IQ are summarized in Table 2. These results supported the view that CaM bound to both N-terminal and proximal C-terminal regions of α1C and that more than one molecule of CaM could bind the C-terminal region, at least in high [Ca2+] conditions.TABLE 2Parameter values for CaM binding to GST fusion peptidesGST fusion peptideBmaxKdWithout CSLWith CSLmol/molμm2+ NT1.010.421.1 LI-II0.340.54ND CT11.14/0.8aCaM binding to CT1 in 1 mm Ca2+ was fitted to a two-site model and expressed as Bmax1/Bmax2.0.23/17.84bCaM binding to CT1 in 1 mm Ca2+ was fitted to a two-site model and expressed as Kd1/Kd2.1.17/29.12bCaM binding to CT1 in 1 mm Ca2+ was fitted to a two-site model and expressed as Kd1/Kd2.

Open table in a new tab Finally, we investigated the effects of CSL on the binding of CaM to the GST fusion peptides of α1C (i.e. NT, CT1, CT1B, PreIQ, and IQ). Binding of CaM (in 1 μm total [CaM]) to these peptides in the absence or presence of 10 μm CSL was compared using the pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 4A (upper gel), whereas CaM binding to NT, CT1, CT1B, and PreIQ tended to be only slightly reduced, CaM binding to IQ was clearly reduced in the presence of CSL. The bi"

Depending on their maturation status, they prime T cells to induce adaptive immunity or tolerance. DCs express CD155, an immunoglobulin-like receptor binding CD226 present on T and natural killer (NK) cells. CD226 represents an important co-stimulator during T cell priming but also serves as an activating receptor on cytotoxic T and NK cells. Here, we report that cells of the T and NK cell lineage of CD155−/− mice express markedly elevated protein levels of CD226 compared with wild type (WT). On heterozygous CD155+/− T cells, CD226 up-regulation is half-maximal, implying an inverse gene-dosis effect. Moreover, CD226 up-regulation is independent of antigen-driven activation because it occurs already in thymocytes and naïve peripheral T cells. In vivo, neutralizing anti-CD155 antibody elicits up-regulation of CD226 on T cells demonstrating, that the observed modulation can be triggered by interrupting CD155-CD226 contacts. Adoptive transfers of WT or CD155−/− T cells into CD155−/− or WT recipients, respectively, revealed that CD226 modulation is accomplished in trans. Analysis of bone marrow chimeras showed that regulators in trans are of hematopoietic origin. We demonstrate that DCs are capable of manipulating CD226 levels on T cells in vivo but not in vitro, suggesting that the process of T cells actively scanning antigen-presenting DCs inside secondary lymphoid organs is required for CD226 modulation. Hence, a CD226 level divergent from WT may be exploited as a sensor to detect abnormal DC/T-cell cross-talk as illustrated for T cells in mice lacking CCR7.

https://openalex.org/W2108153828,"Background Editing deaminases have a pivotal role in cellular physiology. A notable member of this superfamily, APOBEC3G (A3G), restricts retroviruses, and Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) generates antibody diversity by localized deamination of cytosines in DNA. Unconstrained deaminase activity can cause genome-wide mutagenesis and cancer. The mechanisms that protect the genomic DNA from the undesired action of deaminases are unknown. Using the in vitro deamination assays and expression of A3G in yeast, we show that replication protein A (RPA), the eukaryotic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, severely inhibits the deamination activity and processivity of A3G. Principal Findings/Methodology We found that mutations induced by A3G in the yeast genomic reporter are changes of a single nucleotide. This is unexpected because of the known property of A3G to catalyze multiple deaminations upon one substrate encounter event in vitro. The addition of recombinant RPA to the oligonucleotide deamination assay severely inhibited A3G activity. Additionally, we reveal the inverse correlation between RPA concentration and the number of deaminations induced by A3G in vitro on long ssDNA regions. This resembles the “hit and run” single base substitution events observed in yeast. Significance Our data suggest that RPA is a plausible antimutator factor limiting the activity and processivity of editing deaminases in the model yeast system. Because of the similar antagonism of yeast RPA and human RPA with A3G in vitro, we propose that RPA plays a role in the protection of the human genome cell from A3G and other deaminases when they are inadvertently diverged from their natural targets. We propose a model where RPA serves as one of the guardians of the genome that protects ssDNA from the destructive processive activity of deaminases by non-specific steric hindrance."

Under permissive conditions H2K 2B4 cells terminally differentiate in vitro to form uniform myotubes with a myogenic protein profile comparable with freshly isolated satellite cells. Following engraftment into immunodeficient dystrophin-deficient mice, H2K 2B4 cells regenerated host muscle with donor derived myofibres that persisted for at least 24 weeks, without forming tumours. These cells were readily transfectable using both retrovirus and the non-viral transfection methods and importantly upon transplantation, were able to reconstitute the satellite cell niche with functional donor derived satellite cells. Finally using the Class II DNA transposon, Sleeping Beauty, we successfully integrated a reporter plasmid into the genome of H2K 2B4 cells without hindering the myogenic differentiation. Overall, these data suggest that H2K 2B4 cells represent a readily transfectable stable cell-line in which to investigate future stem cell based therapies for muscle disease."
https://openalex.org/W2031837834,"Background Cellular and animal studies implicate multiple roles of amylin in regulating insulin action, glucose and lipid metabolisms. However, the role of amylin in obesity related metabolic disorders has not been thoroughly investigated in humans. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the distribution of circulating amylin and its association with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and explore if this association is influenced by obesity, inflammatory markers or insulin resistance in apparently healthy Chinese. Methods A population-based sample of 1,011 Chinese men and women aged 35–54 years was employed to measure plasma amylin, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]), insulin, glucose and lipid profiles. MetS was defined according to the updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for Asian-Americans. Results Plasma amylin concentrations were higher in overweight/obese participants than normal-weight counterparts (P<0.001) without sex difference. Circulating amylin was positively associated with CRP, IL-6, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin, amylin/insulin ratio, HOMA-IR, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, while negatively associated with HDL cholesterol (all P<0.001). After multiple adjustments, the risk of MetS was significantly higher (odds ratio 3.71; 95% confidence interval: 2.53 to 5.46) comparing the highest with the lowest amylin quartile. The association remained significant even further controlling for BMI, inflammatory markers, insulin or HOMA-IR. Conclusions Our study suggests that amylin is strongly associated with inflammatory markers and MetS. The amylin-MetS association is independent of established risk factors of MetS, including obesity, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance. The causal role of hyperamylinemia in the development of MetS needs to be confirmed prospectively."
https://openalex.org/W2094826474,"Post-translational histone modifications, acting alone or in a context-dependent manner, influence numerous cellular processes via their regulation of gene expression. Monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (K27me1) is a poorly understood histone modification. Some reports describe depletion of K27Me1 at promoters and transcription start sites (TSS), implying its depletion at TSS is necessary for active transcription, while others have associated enrichment of H3K27me1 at TSS with increased levels of mRNA expression. Tissue- and gene-specific patterns of H3K27me1 enrichment and their correlation with gene expression were determined via chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip microarray (ChIP-chip) and human mRNA expression array analyses. Results from erythroid cells were compared with those in neural and muscle cells. H3K27me1 enrichment varied depending on levels of cell-type specific gene expression, with highest enrichment over transcriptionally active genes. Over individual genes, the highest levels of H3K27me1 enrichment were found over the gene bodies of highly expressed genes. In contrast to H3K4me3, which was highly enriched at the TSS of actively transcribing genes, H3K27me1 was selectively depleted at the TSS of actively transcribed genes. There was markedly decreased to no H3K27me1 enrichment in genes with low expression. At some locations, H3K27 monomethylation was also found to be associated with chromatin signatures of gene enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2040829394,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a dominant hereditary disease with a prevalence of 7 per 100,000 individuals, is associated with a partial deletion in the subtelomeric D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q. The D4Z4 repeat contains a strong transcriptional enhancer that activates promoters of several FSHD-related genes. We report here that the enhancer within the D4Z4 repeat binds the Krüppel-like factor KLF15. KLF15 was found to be up-regulated during myogenic differentiation induced by serum starvation or by overexpression of the myogenic differentiation factor MYOD. When overexpressed, KLF15 activated the D4Z4 enhancer and led to overexpression of DUX4c (Double homeobox 4, centromeric) and FRG2 (FSHD region gene 2) genes, whereas its silencing caused inactivation of the D4Z4 enhancer. In immortalized human myoblasts, the D4Z4 enhancer was activated by the myogenic factor MYOD, an effect that was abolished upon KLF15 silencing or when the KLF15-binding sites within the D4Z4 enhancer were mutated, indicating that the myogenesis-related activation of the D4Z4 enhancer was mediated by KLF15. KLF15 and several myogenesis-related factors were found to be expressed at higher levels in myoblasts, myotubes, and muscle biopsies from FSHD patients than in healthy controls. We propose that KLF15 serves as a molecular link between myogenic factors and the activity of the D4Z4 enhancer, and it thus contributes to the overexpression of the DUX4c and FRG2 genes during normal myogenic differentiation and in FSHD."

We have previously reported that this compound in human pancreatic islets stimulates NF-κB signaling and islet cell survival. The aim of this study was to investigate control of NF-κB post-translational modifications exerted by Imatinib and whether any such effects are associated with altered islet gene expression and chemokine production in vitro.Human islets were either left untreated or treated with Imatinib for different timepoints. IκB-α and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and methylation were assessed by immunoblot analysis. Islet gene expression was assessed using a commercial Pathway Finder microarray kit and RT-PCR. Islet chemokine production was determined by flow cytometric bead array analysis.Human islet IκB-α and Ser276-p65 phosphorylation were increased by a 20 minute Imatinib exposure. Methylation of p65 at position Lys221 was increased after 60 min of Imatinib exposure and persisted for 3 hours. Microarray analysis of islets exposed to Imatinib for 4 hours revealed increased expression of the inflammatory genes IL-4R, TCF5, DR5, I-TRAF, I-CAM, HSP27 and IL-8. The islet release of IL-8 was augmented in islets cultured over night in the presence of Imatinib. Following 30 hours of Imatinib exposure, the cytokine-induced IκB-α and STAT1 phosphorylation was abolished and diminished, respectively. The cytokine-induced release of the chemokines MIG and IP10 was lower in islets exposed to Imatinib for 30 hours.Imatinib by itself promotes a modest activation of NF-κB. However, a prolonged exposure of human islets to Imatinib is associated with a dampened response to cytokines. It is possible that Imatinib induces NF-κB preconditioning of islet cells leading to lowered cytokine sensitivity and a mitigated islet inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1963549153,"In general, emotion is known to enhance memory processes. However, the effect of emotion on associative memory and the underling neural mechanisms remains largely unexplored. In this study, we explored brain activation during an associative memory task that involved the encoding and retrieval of word and face pairs. The word and face pairs consisted of either negative or positive words with neutral faces. Significant hippocampal activation was observed during both encoding and retrieval, regardless of whether the word was negative or positive. Negative and positive emotionality differentially affected the hemodynamic responses to encoding and retrieval in the amygdala, with increased responses during encoding negative word and face pairs. Furthermore, activation of the amygdala during encoding of negative word and neutral face pairs was inversely correlated with subsequent memory retrieval. These findings suggest that activation of the amygdala induced by negative emotion during encoding may disrupt associative memory performance."
https://openalex.org/W2089342342,"Non-coding DNA conservation across species has been often used as a predictor for transcriptional enhancer activity. However, only a few systematic analyses of the function of these highly conserved non-coding regions (HCNRs) have been performed. Here we use zebrafish transgenic assays to perform a systematic study of 113 HCNRs from human chromosome 16. By comparing transient and stable transgenesis, we show that the first method is highly inefficient, leading to 40% of false positives and 20% of false negatives. When analyzed in stable transgenic lines, a great majority of HCNRs were active in the central nervous system, although some of them drove expression in other organs such as the eye and the excretory system. Finally, by testing a fraction of the HCNRs lacking enhancer activity for in vivo insulator activity, we find that 20% of them may contain enhancer-blocking function. Altogether our data indicate that HCNRs may contain different types of cis-regulatory activity, including enhancer, insulators as well as other not yet discovered functions."
https://openalex.org/W2042764937,"Background Targeted differentiation of stem cells is mainly achieved by the sequential administration of defined growth factors and cytokines, although these approaches are quite artificial, cost-intensive and time-consuming. We now present a simple xenogeneic rat brain co-culture system which supports neuronal differentiation of adult human stem cells under more in vivo-like conditions. Methods and Findings This system was applied to well-characterized stem cell populations isolated from human skin, parotid gland and pancreas. In addition to general multi-lineage differentiation potential, these cells tend to differentiate spontaneously into neuronal cell types in vitro and are thus ideal candidates for the introduced co-culture system. Consequently, after two days of co-culture up to 12% of the cells showed neuronal morphology and expressed corresponding markers on the mRNA and protein level. Additionally, growth factors with the ability to induce neuronal differentiation in stem cells could be found in the media supernatants of the co-cultures. Conclusions The co-culture system described here is suitable for testing neuronal differentiation capability of numerous types of stem cells. Especially in the case of human cells, it may be of clinical relevance for future cell-based therapeutic applications."

Benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) 2The abbreviations used are: BFNCbenign familial neonatal convulsionsCHXcycloheximideUbubiquitinEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinERendoplasmic reticulum. is an autosomal-dominant form of idiopathic epilepsy characterized by unprovoked partial or generalized seizures within a week after birth and remission after 3–10 weeks (1Jentsch T.J.

BFNC is caused by mutations in voltage-gated Kv7.2/KCNQ2 or Kv7.3/KCNQ3 potassium channel genes, which encode a low threshold, non-inactivating native M-current (4Charlier C. Singh N.A. Ryan S.G.

M-current regulates neuronal excitability, and inhibition of M-current or loss of function of KCNQ2 leads to repetitive firing and epileptic seizures in mice (8Watanabe H. Nagata E. Kosakai A.

Kv7.2/KCNQ2 is a member of the Kv7 family and has six transmembrane domains followed by a long cytoplasmic C terminus that contains many functional motifs and domains. It has previously been shown that most BFNC mutations are located in the C terminus of KCNQ2 (6Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J.

These two distal C-terminal frameshift mutations exhibit normal biophysical properties but show reduced current density (13Singh N.A. Westenskow P. Charlier C. Pappas C. Leslie J. Dillon J.

However, the clinical phenotype of epileptic patients carrying these two distal C-terminal frameshift mutations is no less serious than that in patients with loss-of-function mutations in the pore region that functions as the channel gate and ion selectivity filter (13Singh N.A.

This raises questions as to how the two distal C-terminal frameshift mutations impair channel function and cause epilepsy. Protein degradation is highly selective with individual protein half-lives ranging from minutes to years (17Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). A degradation signal is defined as a protein sequence that can reduce the half-life of the target protein and is sufficient for recognition and degradation by distinct proteolytic pathways (17Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 18Schrader E.K. Harstad K.G. Matouschek A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). An important property of degradation signals is their transferability, and genetically engineered attachment of such signal sequences leads to metabolic instability in otherwise long-lived proteins (17Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the mechanism by which two C-terminal frameshift mutations that bring about the impairment of the channel function underlie BFNC. Using biochemical approaches combined with electrophysiology, we identified a novel degradation signal in the extended segments of the two frameshift mutations. This degradation signal contains a critical five-amino acid motif that leads to accelerated degradation of the mutant proteins through the ubiquitin-independent proteasome machinery but does not affect mRNA quantity and protein trafficking. Our findings demonstrate that BFNC haploinsufficiency is caused by accelerated degradation of channel proteins carrying the degradation signal, and this cellular mechanism brings about impaired channel function and causes neonatal epilepsy. The human KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 cDNAs were kindly provided by Thomas J. Jentsch, and all point mutants, deletion mutants, and fusion proteins were created by PCR-based mutagenesis with LA taq (Takara). KCNQ2 and its mutants were tagged with three tandem-repeated FLAG epitopes (DYKDDDDK) at their N terminus. All CD4 and CD4 mutant constructs were tagged with HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA). CD4-GFP60aa was generated by adding 60 C-terminal residues of green fluorescent protein to the C terminus of CD4. CD4-ExtraC was constructed by appending ExtraC to the C terminus of CD4. For whole-cell patch clamp recording, cycloheximide treatment, pulse-chase assay, surface biotinylation, ubiquitination assay, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis, all cDNA clones used in these experiments were constructed and inserted into the pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech). For two-electrode voltage clamp recording, wild-type constructs of KCNQ2, KCNQ3, and KCNQ5 and their mutants were introduced into the KSM vector (19Jow F. Wang K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). KCNQ2 and Q2-2513del1bp were constructed and inserted into pEGFPC2 (Clontech) for fluorescence microscopy. For staining of localization in the ER, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with EGFP-KCNQ2 or EGFP-fsKCNQ2 (Q2-2513del1bp) and pDsRed2-ER (Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 36 h of incubation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS containing 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaC12) three times, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 15 min before washing in PBS three times. Slides were mounted with mounting medium, and images were obtained using a confocal microscope (FV1000; Olympus). For staining of localization in the Golgi apparatus, cells transfected with EGFP-KCNQ2 or EGFP-fsKCNQ2 were fixed as above. Cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min, and blocked in 5% goat serum/PBS for 1 h prior to incubation for 2 h at room temperature with rat antibody against GM130 (a Golgi matrix protein) at dilution of 1:150 (BD Transduction Laboratories) with serum/PBS. Cells were washed in PBS three times, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with TRITC-conjugated anti-rat antibody (1:250; Zhongshanjinqiao, Beijing, China). After washing three times in PBS, slides were mounted with mounting medium and images were obtained using the same confocal microscope. For whole-cell patch clamp recording, currents were recorded at room temperature using the EPC 10 UBS patch clamp amplifier (HEKA). Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had a final resistance of 3–5 megaohms when filled with internal pipette solution that contained 130 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, and 3 mm Mg-ATP at pH 7.3. Cells were perfused with the external solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. Data were acquired and analyzed using PatchMaster software (HEKA). For two-electrode voltage clamp recording, Xenopus oocytes (stages V and VI) were selected and injected with 46 nl of solution containing 10 ng of cRNA using a microinjector (Drummond Scientific Co.). 3 days after injection, oocytes were impaled with two microelectrodes (0.5–1.0 megaohm) filled with 3 m KCl in a 40-μl recording chamber, and whole cell currents were recorded using a two-electrode voltage clamp. The chamber was constantly perfused with ND-96 recording solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES at pH 7.6. Currents were recorded in ND-96 solution at room temperature using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) or an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments). Data were acquired and analyzed using Pulse software (HEKA). For cycloheximide treatment, transfected Cos-7 cells were treated with cycloheximide for various time periods and then analyzed by Western blot. For Western blot assay, protein samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) before blocking with a blocking buffer of 5% powdered nonfat milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (1:2000 anti-HA from Roche Applied Science; 1:4000, anti-FLAG from Sigma; 1:500 anti-actin and anti-GAPDH from Santa Cruz) diluted with blocking buffer. After washing with TBS-T three times, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with their corresponding secondary HRP-coupled antibodies (1:5000 Santa Cruz) diluted with blocking buffer. After washing three times, signal was detected by using the Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Millipore). Confluent monolayers of HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-KCNQ2 or FLAG-fsKCNQ2 were washed 3 times with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+ PBS. HEK293 cells were biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in Ca2+/Mg2+ PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C. The remaining biotin was quenched by incubating the cells for an additional 10 min with 100 mm glycine in TBS. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaC1, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 30 min. One fraction of cell lysate containing 200 μg of protein was incubated with 20 μl of neutravidin beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the other fraction was prepared as total protein. After incubation, the beads carrying surface proteins were washed with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer and eluted with loading buffer. The total and surface proteins were both loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE and assayed by Western blotting. HEK293 cells expressing HA-tagged CD4 or CD4-ExtraC were starved of methionine and cysteine for 1 h (with DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine) and then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Easy Tag Express; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS three times and incubated in regular DMEM for various time periods (0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 h). The cells were then washed twice in PBS and solubilized with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer. Cell lysate containing 200 μg of protein was incubated with Protein G-Sepharose (20 μl, GE Healthcare) and anti-HA antibody (1 μg, Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer, the samples were dissolved in 30 μl of loading buffer, loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE, and assayed by autoradiography. Cos-7 cells transfected with a combination of cDNA constructs of FLAG-KCNQ2 or FLAG-fsKCNQ2 with HA-ubiquitin (Ub) were harvested and lysed after expression for 24 h and treatment with MG132 for an additional 12 h. Cell lysate containing 200 μg of protein was incubated with Protein G-Sepharose (20 μl, GE Healthcare) and anti-FLAG antibody (1 μg, Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, dissolved in 30 μl of loading buffer, and loaded onto 6% SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting with anti-HA (1:2000, Roche Applied Science). Total RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. A total of 10 μg of RNA was treated with RNase-free Turbo DNase (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C. RNA were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The purified RNA was reverse-transcribed directly using the MMLV-RT, SPCL kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After cDNA synthesis, real-time RT-PCR was performed with the 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the SYBR Premix Ex TaqII kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Pairs of sequence-specific primers used in this study are as follows: human KCNQ2 forward (5′-GGCTTCAGCATCTCCCAGT-3′) and reverse (5′-GACTCTCCCTCCGCAATGTA-3′) and human GAPDH forward (5′-CCACTCCTCCACCTTTGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-ACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCA-3′). All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. Statistics were performed using Prism 4.0 software. Statistical significance was assessed using the t test. The human mutant Q2-2513del1bp studied in this paper results from one nucleotide deletion at position 2513 bp, which was designated fsKCNQ2 (frameshift mutant of KCNQ2). The fsKCNQ2 mutation results in a distal C-terminal deletion of the last seven amino acids before the stop codon, which are replaced with an extra sequence of 63 amino acids (designated ExtraC). This fsKCNQ2 mutant does not change the intrinsic motifs or domains of the channel, as compared with wild-type (WT) KCNQ2 (Fig. 1). Another distal C-terminal frameshift mutation in this study results from an insertion of five nucleotides at 2516 bp (designated Q2-2516ins5bp), leading to the generation of the same ExtraC (Fig. 1). To investigate the mechanism by which these distal frameshift mutations of KCNQ2 underlie BFNC, we began by confirming previous electrophysiological findings. Consistent with previous reports (13Singh N.A. Westenskow P. Charlier C. Pappas C. Leslie J. Dillon J. Anderson V.E. Sanguinetti M.C. Leppert M.F.

(n = 4–7; ***, p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To make sure the inhibitory effect of the fsKCNQ2 mutant on channel function was specifically mediated by the extended C-terminal segment (ExtraC), we generated a truncation mutant (Q2–838X) by deleting the extended C terminus (63 amino acids) of the fsKCNQ2 mutant. In the Q2–838X mutant, the number with letter X stands for the amino acid mutated to the stop code where translation ends. The Q2–838X mutant without ExtraC expressed a robust current with gain of function (Fig. 2B), suggesting that dysfunction of the fsKCNQ2 mutant is due to ExtraC causing current reduction. KCNQ3 that functions as an auxiliary subunit has been shown to facilitate KCNQ2 function. To test whether KCNQ3 can reverse the effect of this frameshift mutation, we co-injected the cRNA of fsKCNQ2 with KCNQ3 into Xenopus oocytes. Co-injection of the fsKCNQ2 mutant with WT KCNQ3 failed to cause an increase in current expression as compared with co-injection of WT KCNQ2 with KCNQ3, demonstrating that KCNQ3 cannot rescue the function of the fsKCNQ2 mutant (Fig. 2B). To confirm the effect of the ExtraC peptide, we appended it to the C terminus of KCNQ5, another member of the KCNQ family. Consistent with the result of co-expression of fsKCNQ2 with KCNQ3, KCNQ5 with ExtraC appended (KCNQ5-ExtraC) resulted in significant reduction of current density when coexpressed with KCNQ3 (Fig. 2C). These results show that the ExtraC derived from the C-terminal frameshift mutations of KCNQ2 is responsible for current reduction. To examine whether the reduced current density of fsKCNQ2 mutant resulted from reduced surface expression, we used confocal fluorescence microscopy and biotin labeling for surface protein assay. We used the pDsRed2-ER plasmid to label the ER and the GM130 antibody (GM130) to stain the Golgi apparatus for identification of localization with wild-type KCNQ2 or the fsKCNQ2 mutant by confocal imaging. Similar to WT KCNQ2, fsKCNQ2 proteins were localized in both the ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3A), showing that the mutant can leave the ER and traffic to the Golgi apparatus. To relatively quantify surface expression, surface proteins WT KCNQ2 or fsKCNQ2 expressed in HEK293 were labeled by biotin and analyzed by Western blotting. Biotin labeling showed that both surface and total protein of the fsKCNQ2 mutant were much less than WT KCNQ2 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that decreased surface fsKCNQ2, which underlies the reduced current density, is likely due to the reduction of the total amount of fsKCNQ2 protein (Fig. 3B). To eliminate the possibility of protein reduction caused by reduced plasmid transfection or gene transcription of fsKCNQ2, we also quantified KCNQ2 mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. Cells transfected with WT KCNQ2 or fsKCNQ2 plasmid showed little difference in mRNA quantity (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that neither transfection nor transcription was affected. These results suggest that reduced surface expression of the mutant protein likely results from increased protein degradation. To test the stability of fsKCNQ2, we treated Cos-7 cells expressing fsKCNQ2 with the protein synthesis blocker cycloheximide (CHX) and evaluated protein stability by Western blotting of remaining proteins after degradation. After 12 h of CHX treatment, the half-life of fsKCNQ2 was about 4 h. In contrast, the half-life of WT KCNQ2 was more than 12 h (Fig. 4A). This result of this shortened half-life of these mutant proteins was also confirmed in both HEK293 and CHO cells (supplemental Fig. 1). These results indicate that fsKCNQ2 protein degradation is accelerated, leading to reduced surface expression. Proteasome and lysosome pathways are widely considered to be mechanisms for protein degradation. Using the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 or the lysosome-specific inhibitor chloroquine, we sought to determine whether fsKCNQ2 protein degradation is mediated by these two pathways. In WT KCNQ2 expressing Cos-7 cells treated with CHX, KCNQ2 protein showed no obvious difference in degradation in the presence or absence of either chloroquine or MG132 (Fig. 4B, top panels). In contrast, Cos-7 cells expressing the fsKCNQ2 mutant that were treated only with CHX resulted in significant protein degradation that was inhibited upon treatment with MG132, as compared with the chloroquine group (Fig. 4B, bottom panels). These results show that the proteasome pathway, and not the lysosome pathway, underlies the destabilization of fsKCNQ2 mutant protein. We next investigated whether accelerated proteasome-dependent degradation of fsKCNQ2 is due to ubiquitination of this mutant. To test for ubiquitination of the fsKCNQ2 mutant, Cos-7 cells expressing different combinations of HA-Ub, FLAG-KCNQ2, and FLAG-fsKCNQ2 were treated with MG132 for 12 h. Proteins were subject to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and Western-blotted with anti-HA antibody. Ubiquitination of a target protein resulted in smeared bands at a high molecular weight (Fig. 4C). As a control, WT KCNQ2 was subjected to ubiquitination, as previously demonstrated in a similar assay (20Ekberg J. Schuetz F. Boase N.A. Conroy S.J. Manning J. Kumar S. Poronnik P. Adams D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12135-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similar to WT KCNQ2, the fsKCNQ2 mutant showed no further ubiquitination when it was co-expressed with HA-Ub proteins (Fig. 4C). This result indicates that the proteasome-dependent degradation of fsKCNQ2 does not rely on ubiquitination. To test whether the degradation effect of the ExtraC peptide can be transferred to another unrelated protein, we fused the ExtraC to the C terminus of CD4 (CD4-ExtraC). As a control, we attached the C terminus of CD4 to GFP60aa (C-terminal 60 residues of green fluorescent protein). GFP60aa contains the same number of residues as ExtraC. After CHX treatment for 7 h in HEK293 cells, CD4-ExtraC was dramatically degraded with a half-life of about 1.5 h, as compared with WT CD4 or CD4-GFPC60aa that had a half-life of more than 6 h, showing that the function of ExtraC, which is specific for protein degradation, is transferable (Fig. 5A). To further confirm this result, we used the metabolism inhibitor-free pulse-chase assay in which newly synthesized proteins were labeled by 32S and then evaluated for isotope-labeled CD4 and CD4-ExtraC proteins over a period of 6 h. Appending the ExtraC to the C terminus of CD4 resulted in fast degradation (Fig. 5B), further demonstrating the transferability of ExtraC, which was identified as a degradation signal. To identify the key motif/residues within ExtraC that mediate degradation, we constructed several deletions of fsKCNQ2. Serial C-terminal deletions of fsKCNQ2 were designated as fsQ2–869X, -865X, -860X, -853X, and -845X, in which the three digit numbers represent the position of the amino acid mutated to the stop codon that is designated as X. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of HEK293 cells expressing either fsKCNQ2 or truncated mutants fsQ2–869X and fsQ2–865X resulted in significant reduction of current density as compared with the robust current expression of WT KCNQ2 or truncated mutants fsQ2–860X, fsQ2–853X, and fsQ2–845X (Fig. 6A, left panel). Comparison of fsQ2–860X and fsQ2–865X reveals the motif RCLRG containing five residues that distinguishes the two mutants (Fig. 6A). fsKCNQ2 and two truncated mutants that all carry this RCLRG motif showed a small amount of current, which was in contrast with WT KCNQ2 and mutants without the motif that showed robust current expression (Fig. 6A, left panel). To investigate whether reduced currents were due to degradation, we transfected WT KCNQ2 and the three mutants fsQ2–865X, fsQ2–860X, and fsKCNQ2 into Cos-7 cells treated with or without CHX (75 μg/ml) for 12 h. Blocking protein synthesis with CHX revealed that both fsQ2–865X truncation and fsKCNQ2 mutant proteins showed fast degradation, as compared with either fsQ2–860X or WT KCNQ2 (Fig. 6A, right panel).

https://openalex.org/W1969935418,"State of the art (DNA) sequencing methods applied in “Omics” studies grant insight into the ‘blueprints’ of organisms from all domains of life. Sequencing is carried out around the globe and the data is submitted to the public repositories of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. However, the context in which these studies are conducted often gets lost, because experimental data, as well as information about the environment are rarely submitted along with the sequence data. If these contextual or metadata are missing, key opportunities of comparison and analysis across studies and habitats are hampered or even impossible. To address this problem, the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) promotes checklists and standards to better describe our sequence data collection and to promote the capturing, exchange and integration of sequence data with contextual data. In a recent community effort the GSC has developed a series of recommendations for contextual data that should be submitted along with sequence data. To support the scientific community to significantly enhance the quality and quantity of contextual data in the public sequence data repositories, specialized software tools are needed. In this work we present CDinFusion, a web-based tool to integrate contextual and sequence data in (Multi)FASTA format prior to submission. The tool is open source and available under the Lesser GNU Public License 3. A public installation is hosted and maintained at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology at http://www.megx.net/cdinfusion.

https://openalex.org/W2094455722,"The RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) is involved in the synthesis of the m7Gppp-RNA cap structure found at the 5′ end of eukaryotic mRNAs. GTases are members of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which also includes DNA and RNA ligases. GTases catalyze a two-step reaction in which they initially utilize GTP as a substrate to form a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The GMP moiety is then transferred to the diphosphate end of the RNA transcript in the second step of the reaction to form the Gppp-RNA structure. In the current study, we used a combination of virtual database screening, homology modeling, and biochemical assays to search for novel GTase inhibitors. Using this approach, we demonstrate that mycophenolic acid (MPA) can inhibit the GTase reaction by preventing the catalytic transfer of the GMP moiety onto an acceptor RNA. As such, MPA represents a novel type of inhibitor against RNA guanylyltransferases that inhibits the second step of the catalytic reaction. Moreover, we show that the addition of MPA to S. cerevisiae cells leads to a reduction of capped mRNAs. Finally, biochemical assays also demonstrate that MPA can inhibit DNA ligases through inhibition of the second step of the reaction. The biological implications of these findings for the MPA-mediated inhibition of members of the covalent nucleotidyl superfamily are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1970141244,"Although esterification of free cholesterol to cholesteryl ester in the liver is known to be catalyzed by the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, ACAT, the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (nCEH) that catalyzes the reverse reaction has remained elusive. Because cholesterol undergoes continuous cycling between free and esterified forms, the steady-state concentrations in the liver of the two species and their metabolic availability for pathways, such as lipoprotein assembly and bile acid synthesis, depend upon nCEH activity. On the basis of the general characteristics of the family of rat carboxylesterases, we hypothesized that one member, ES-4, was a promising candidate as a hepatic nCEH. Using under- and overexpression approaches, we provide multiple lines of evidence that establish ES-4 as a bona fide endogenous nCEH that can account for the majority of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in transformed rat hepatic cells and primary rat hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2046327273,"Despite their predicted functional importance, most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in Caenorhabditis elegans have remained largely uncharacterized. Here, we focused on one GPCR, STR-33, encoded by the str-33 gene, which was discovered through a ligand-based screening procedure. To characterize STR-33 function, we performed UV-trimethylpsolaren mutagenesis and isolated an str-33-null mutant. The resulting mutant showed hypersinusoidal movement and a hyperactive egg-laying phenotype. Two types of egg laying-related mutations have been characterized: egg laying-deficient (Egl-d) and hyperactive egg laying (Egl-c). The defect responsible for the egg laying-deficient Egl-d phenotype is related to Gαq signaling, whereas that responsible for the opposite, hyperactive egg-laying Egl-c phenotype is related to Gαo signaling. We found that the hyperactive egg-laying defect of the str-33(ykp001) mutant is dependent on the G protein GOA-1/Gαo. Endogenous acetylcholine suppressed egg laying in C. elegans via a Gαo-signaling pathway by inhibiting serotonin biosynthesis or release from the hermaphrodite-specific neuron. Consistent with this, in vivo expression of the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme, TPH-1, was up-regulated in the str-33(ykp001) mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that the GPCR, STR-33, may be one of the neurotransmitter receptors that regulates locomotion and egg laying in C. elegans.

Paiva A.C. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aid. Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 649-658Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GPCRs, which share a conserved seven-transmembrane domain structure, transduce environmental stimuli into intracellular signals by coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins. The subfamily of G proteins to which the receptor couples defines the specific linkage to intracellular effectors and determines the nature of the intracellular signal. In Caenorhabditis elegans, GPCRs are involved in a wide range of physiological functions, including perception of odorants and regulation of behaviors, such as locomotion (2Dittman J.S. Kaplan J.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7104-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), pharyngeal pumping (3Steger K.A. Avery L.

G-protein-coupled receptor acetylcholine γ-aminobutyric acid hermaphrodite-specific neuron ventral cord motor neuron 5-hydroxytryptamine nematode growth medium trimethylpsolaren. C. elegans locomotion involves sinusoidal movements that reflect neurotransmission at neuromuscular junctions regulated by dorsal and ventral motor neurons. The GPCR ligand acetylcholine (ACh) is a major neurotransmitter in C. elegans excitatory signaling pathways involved in regulating biological behaviors, including locomotion (5Rand J.B. Russell R.L. Genetics. 1984; 106: 227-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bany I.A. Dong M.Q. Koelle M.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8060-8069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) mediates inhibitory influences on locomotion and other behaviors (7McIntire S.L. Jorgensen E. Kaplan J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Appropriate movement behavior requires a balance between ACh and GABA (8Schuske K. Beg A.A. Jorgensen E.M. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For example, mutation of the cholinergic biosynthetic enzyme CHA-1 produces a severe, uncoordinated locomotor phenotype characterized by deep body-bending movement (5Rand J.B. Russell R.L. Genetics. 1984; 106: 227-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mutation of the UNC-25 protein, which encodes a GABA biosynthetic enzyme, produces the opposite phenotype (7McIntire S.L. Jorgensen E. Kaplan J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Egg-laying behavior is primarily regulated by two classes of motor neurons: hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) and ventral cord (VC) motor neurons. Of these, HSNs play the more critical role (9Shyn S.I. Kerr R. Schafer W.R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1910-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). HSNs make neuromuscular junctions with vulval muscles and VC motor neurons, which are cholinergic neurons that inhibit egg laying by inhibiting HSNs. ACh signaling through a putative GPCR coupled to the G protein GOA-1/Gαo in HSNs suppresses the egg-laying behavior of C. elegans by inhibiting biosynthesis or release of newly synthesized 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (6Bany I.A. Dong M.Q. Koelle M.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8060-8069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tanis J.E. Moresco J.J. Lindquist R.A. Koelle M.R. Genetics. 2008; 178: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Expression of the tph-1 gene, which encodes tryptophan hydroxylase-1, is strongly suppressed by GOA-1/Gαo; conversely, tph-1 expression is activated by EGL-30/Gαq. Thus, signaling through Go suppresses egg laying by inhibiting 5-HT biosynthesis in HSNs, whereas Gq-mediated signaling stimulates 5-HT biosynthesis and egg laying (9Shyn S.I. Kerr R. Schafer W.R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1910-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Tanis J.E. Moresco J.J. Lindquist R.A. Koelle M.R. Genetics. 2008; 178: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that some mechanosensory neurons also regulate egg laying by inhibiting HSNs as well as VC motor neurons (11Zhang M. Chung S.H. Fang-Yen C. Craig C. Kerr R.A. Suzuki H. Samuel A.D. Mazur E. Schafer W.R. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although the specific signaling pathways and proteins involved have not yet been identified. Although diverse biological processes in C. elegans are mediated by GPCRs, many of these GPCRs are orphan receptors, and the specific function of only a few has been clarified. In this study, we sought to identify the function of nematode-specific GPCRs for which reverse genetics has failed to identify orthologs in other species. Here, we show that the newly isolated str-33, a member of the str family and one of the uncharacterized nematode-specific GPCRs, mediates locomotion and egg-laying behavior of C. elegans in mechanosensory neurons. C. elegans strains were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates at 20 °C, as described previously (12Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N2 Bristol strain was used for all experiments unless otherwise noted. Worms were fed Escherichia coli strain OP50. The following strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (Minneapolis, MN): Bristol N2, MT2426 goa-1(n1134)I, GR1321 tph-1(mg280)II, CB1339 mec-4(e1339)X, and CB1515 mec-10(e1515)X. str-33(ykp001)V was isolated using a reverse genetics method. The GOA-1 constitutively activated animal vsIs49 (10Tanis J.E. Moresco J.J. Lindquist R.A. Koelle M.R. Genetics. 2008; 178: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Moresco J.J.

Koelle (Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). mec-4(u231) mutant was kindly provided by Prof. Monica Driscoll (Rutgers University). Double-mutant strains were generated using standard genetics techniques (12Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The goa-1(n1134) mutation is a G-to-A transition in the first codon that eliminates an NcoI site (14Ségalat L. Elkes D.A. Kaplan J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1648-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The mutant str-33 gene was isolated by reverse genetics screening using UV-trimethylpsolaren (TMP) mutagenesis. Briefly, mutations in C. elegans were induced by exposure to UV irradiation in the presence of TMP (Sigma-Aldrich). Mutants were screened using a nested PCR-based method and sib selection. The following primers were designed based on the predicted N-terminal sequences of str-33: 5′-GCA TTG TGA ATG CAG TGA TCA G-3′ (outer sense) and 5′-GTG CAT TGA TGC ACC ACA AAA CAG CA-3′ (outer antisense); 5′-GAC CAG ATC TAT AGT TCC GGT CCT GT-3′ (inner sense) and 5′-GCA GGT ATG AAG CAG GCG TAA GGT TA-3′ (inner antisense). A homozygous line containing a 917-bp deletion was isolated and out-crossed with the wild type for six generations to eliminate other mutations that might have been formed by UV-TMP random mutagenesis. For life span assays, synchronized stage L4 animals were transferred to a fresh plate and scored every 2 days. Animals were scored as dead when they no longer responded to gentle prodding with a platinum wire. Life span is defined as the time (t) from the L2 larval stage (t = 0) until the day worms were scored as dead. Death by internal hatching of progeny, desiccation on the wall of the plate, extruded vulva, or loss during handling was not scored in life span assays. The brood sizes of N2 and str-33(ykp001) hermaphrodites were determined by placing late L4 stage individual worms on OP50-seeded plates and allowing them to self-fertilize at 20 °C. The Po parental animal was then transferred to a fresh plate every 24 h for the following 5 days. The total number of F1 progeny on the plates was counted. Body bending rate assays were performed as described previously (15Sawin E.R. Ranganathan R. Horvitz H.R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 619-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Briefly, stage-synchronized young adult hermaphrodites were transferred from OP50-NGM agar plates onto a fresh, foodless NGM plate. Observation began 1 min after transfer. The number of body bends in 20-s intervals was recorded separately for each of the five animals on the assay plates. Forward run duration was counted as the time (s) from the initiation of forward movement to the initiation of backward movement. Backward run duration was counted using the same method. Spontaneous coiling was counted as the time (s) from initiation of coiling to the resumption of movement. Movement pattern was analyzed by calculating the ratio of each movement for 7 min, as described previously (16Tsalik E.L. Hobert O. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 178-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The movement ratio for each movement was measured by transferring synchronized young adult hermaphrodites to a fresh plate and recording the time for every movement over a 1-min interval and calculating the ratio (%) 5 min after loading. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA fragment encompassing the full-length str-33 gene was ligated into the GFP cassette pPD114.108, kindly provided by A. Fire (Department of Pathology and Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine). The Pstr-33::GFP construct was prepared by amplifying C. elegans genomic DNA by PCR to obtain a 5,064-bp promoter sequence of str-33 and ligating the resulting DNA fragment into BamHI/SmaI restriction sites in the multicloning site of the pPD114.108 GFP vector. The primers used were 5′-GGA TCC CGG GCC ATA ATA ATT TCG GG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCC GGG GCG AAG GTT CAC CGT CAT-3′ (antisense). The construct (100 ng/μl) was co-injected with the rol-6(su1006) plasmid pRF4 (50 ng/μl) into wild-type C. elegans, and transgenic worms were observed using an AXIO fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). The Ptph-1::GFP construct was prepared by PCR amplification of a 2,514-bp promoter sequence upstream of the open reading frame for tph-1 using C. elegans genomic DNA as a template. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated into HindIII/BamHI restriction sites in the multicloning site of the pPD95.79 GFP vector. The Ptph-1::GFP construct (100 ng/μl) was injected into wild-type C. elegans and transferred to str-33(ykp001) mutants by mating to generate str-33(ykp001);Ex[Ptph-1::GFP] transgenic animals. Synchronized L4 stage animals were transferred to fresh NGM plates and incubated at 20 °C. After 36 h, tph-1 gene expression was compared in animals with wild-type and str-33(ykp001) mutant backgrounds. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss AXIO fluorescent microscope, and image analysis was carried out using AxioVision software. Pmec-4::DsRED was created to confirm the expression loci of STR-33 as described previously (17Royal D.C. Bianchi L. Royal M.A. Lizzio Jr., M. Mukherjee G. Nunez Y.O. Driscoll M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41976-41986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, a touch receptor neuron-specific construct was prepared by PCR, yielding a 1,140-bp promoter sequence of mec-4. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated into restriction sites within the multicloning site of the pPD95.79 DsRED vector, which had been produced by substitution of a GFP-encoding region into DsRED. This final construct was co-injected into animals with the Pstr-33::GFP reporter construct. Extrachromosomal arrays carrying the str-33-rescuing transgene construct, Ex[str-33(+)], contained a 3.6-kb str-33 PCR product from genomic DNA encompassing a 2-kb upstream promoter region of str-33 and the full-length str-33 gene. The str-33 PCR product (∼100 ng/μl) was injected into str-33(ykp001) mutants; Pmyo-2::GFP (50 ng/μl) was included as a co-injection marker to monitor myo-2 expression in pharyngeal muscles (18Chatzigeorgiou M. Yoo S. Watson J.D. Lee W.H. Spencer W.C. Kindt K.S. Hwang S.W. Miller 3rd, D.M. Treinin M. Driscoll M. Schafer W.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To determine whether str-33 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, we microinjected mechanosensory neuron-specific promoter::str-33 fusion constructs into str-33(ykp001) mutants. These rescuing constructs contained the full-length str-33 gene (from the ATG start to the TAA stop codon, amplified from N2 genomic DNA) under the transcriptional control of a 1.1-kb upstream region of mec-4. The resulting Pmec-4::str-33 construct directed mechanosensory neuron-specific expression of STR-33. This rescuing product was injected into str-33(ykp001) mutants at ∼100 ng/μl; 50 ng/μl of Pmyo-2::GFP was included as a co-injection marker to monitor myo-2 expression in pharyngeal muscles. The average number of unlaid eggs and the percentage of early stage eggs laid were quantified as described previously (6Bany I.A. Dong M.Q. Koelle M.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8060-8069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Staged adults were obtained by collecting late L4 animals and culturing at 20 °C for 36 h. In the unlaid egg assay, 30 staged adults were individually dissolved in 10% sodium hypochlorite, and their eggs were counted (eggs survive this procedure because of their shells). Five staged adults were placed on an NGM agar plate and allowed to lay eggs for 1 h, after which adults were killed. Each egg was observed under an Olympus SZ-40 dissecting microscope and categorized as having eight or fewer cells. Eggs with eight or fewer cells were classified as “early stage.” The effects of drugs on egg-laying behavior were determined by measuring the egg-laying rate on plates containing different concentrations of levamisole. Egg-laying rates were determined by placing five adult (L4) animals on each plate and, 36 h later, counting the number of eggs laid in 1 h. For egg-laying assays performed in liquid, stage-synchronized adults were placed into 20 μl of M9 solution (20 mm KH2PO4, 40 mm Na2HPO4, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4) without or with 5-HT creatinine sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich). The number of eggs laid in each well was counted after 90 min. The aldicarb treatment assay was done as previously described (20Govorunova E.G. Moussaif M. Kullyev A. Nguyen K.C. McDonald T.V. Hall D.H. Sze J.Y. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, L4 stage larvae were transferred to plates seeded with E. coli OP50 and incubated at 20 °C for 12 h. In all experiments, the time course of paralysis was measured by scoring the percentage of paralyzed animals on the plates every 20 min over a 3-h period. An animal was counted as paralyzed if no movement was observed after gentle prodding with a platinum wire. The inhibition of aldicarb effects by exogenous 5-HT was assayed by first incubating young adults for 2 h on plates containing 12.5 mm 5-HT creatinine sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) and then transferring them to plates containing both 1 mm aldicarb and 12.5 mm 5-HT creatinine sulfate for assay of the time course of paralysis. To avoid bias, behavioral assays, including egg-laying, egg stimulation, and paralysis assays, were carried out by investigators blinded to genotype. During the course of studying daumone signaling-associated proteins, we discovered STR-33, a novel GPCR-like protein that lacks homology to known mammalian proteins 5Pan-Young Jeong and Young-Ki Paik, unpublished data. . To characterize this protein, we constructed a specific str-33 single mutant strain, termed str-33(ykp001), using UV-TMP random mutagenesis. DNA sequencing revealed that the str-33 mutant gene contained a 917-bp deletion in a region spanning from the upstream promoter (−57) to the second intronic region (+860). We anticipated that this mutation would be functionally null because it lacked a start codon (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). We next confirmed the mutation in the str-33 gene locus using external and internal primer sets (Fig. 1B). Basic physiological features, including adult life span, total brood size, pharyngeal pumping rates, and defecation rhythm, were unchanged in str-33(ykp001) mutants (data not shown). Unlike wild-type animals, which move forward through regular sinusoidal movements, str-33(ykp001) mutants displayed locomotor defects, exhibiting exaggerated body-bending locomotion that resulted in a steeper slope of sinusoidal movement (Fig. 1C). The bending rate of str-33(ykp001) mutant (13.9 ± 1.59, n = 15) was lower than that of wild-type animals (21.8 ± 1.62, n = 15; Fig. 1D). Moreover, the frequency of forward movement was lower, whereas that of backward movement was higher in str-33(ykp001) mutants. Adoption of a spontaneous coiling state, which was not observed in wild-type animals, was also detected frequently (Fig. 1, D–F). The net result of these properties was that str-33(ykp001) mutants showed deep body-bending movement but slower forward progress. str-33(ykp001) mutants showed a hyperactive egg-laying phenotype in which worms are unable to properly inhibit egg laying. Whereas wild-type animals retained an average of 12.8 ± 1.8 eggs within their uterus and laid eggs that had reached the gastrulation stage, str-33(ykp001) mutants laid early stage eggs, resulting in the retention of fewer eggs (4.6 ± 1.6; n = 30; Fig. 2, A and B), regardless of adult reproductive stage (supplemental Fig. S2). To confirm that this abnormal egg-laying behavior was attributable to the STR-33 mutant, we performed str-33 gene rescue experiments by transforming a str-33(ykp001);Ex[str-33(+)] genomic fragment into the str-33(ykp001) mutant. As shown in Fig. 2, B and D, this maneuver corrected the hyperactive egg-laying phenotype; str-33(ykp001);Ex[str-33(+)] transgenic animals retained more eggs (9.2 ± 3.3, n = 20) than str-33(ykp001) mutants and laid many fewer early stage eggs (5%). Furthermore, the rescued transgenic animals showed an apparent recovery from the exaggerated body-bending defect, exhibiting wild type-like sinusoidal forward locomotion (Fig. 1, C–F). Like str-33(ykp001) mutants, goa-1(n1134) mutants bearing a GOA-1/Gαo loss-of-function mutation exhibited a strong hyperactive egg-laying phenotype, retaining fewer eggs (1.6 ± 0.5, n = 30) and laying predominantly (∼85%) early stage eggs (Fig. 2B), suggesting that STR-33 may be involved in this known egg-laying regulatory pathway (Fig. 2, B and D). To test this, we constructed goa-1(n1134);str-33(ykp001) double loss-of-function mutants and examined their egg-laying phenotype. goa-1(n1134);str-33(ykp001) double mutants exhibited a phenotype similar to that of goa-1(n1134) mutants (Fig. 2, B and D). To clarify whether GOA-1 activation is sufficient to inhibit egg laying, we created a transgenic animal in which GOA-1 is constitutively active in the background of str-33(ykp001) mutants. The GTPase-deficient GOA-1(Q205L) mutant described previously (10Tanis J.E. Moresco J.J. Lindquist R.A. Koelle M.R. Genetics. 2008; 178: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used for this purpose. As reported, goa-1(Q205L) mutants showed an egg laying-defective phenotype opposite that of the goa-1(n1134) loss-of-function mutant, exhibiting uterine retention of many eggs (30.1 ± 6.7, n = 30) (Fig. 2B). Expression of constitutively active GOA-1(Q205L) in str-33(ykp001) mutants recapitulated the same egg laying-defective phenotype of goa-1(Q205L) single mutants (Fig. 2B), with each animal retaining an average of 27.4 ± 4.1 (n = 30) eggs in its uterus. These results suggest that the STR-33 functions upstream of GOA-1/Gαo to regulate egg laying and locomotion. To examine STR-33 expression patterns, we injected a Pstr-33::GFP reporter construct into wild-type animals. Unexpectedly, str-33 was not expressed in HSNs or VC neurons, which are directly involved in egg-laying behavior (6Bany I.A. Dong M.Q. Koelle M.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8060-8069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tanis J.E. Moresco J.J. Lindquist R.A. Koelle M.R. Genetics. 2008; 178: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it was detected in ALM and PLM mechanosensory neurons and head neurons (Fig. 3A). To confirm that expression of str-33 was located in PLM neurons, we co-injected a str-33 reporter construct with the mechanosensory neuron-specific marker, mec-4::Ds-RED, which revealed expression in ALM and PLM neurons (Fig. 3B). The primary function of ALM (L/R) and PLM (L/R) neurons is to respond to anterior and posterior touch, respectively, via interneurons (21Chalfie M. Sulston J.E. White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 956-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this unexpected result suggested that some mechanosensory neurons play a role in regulating egg laying, as has been noted previously (11Zhang M. Chung S.H. Fang-Yen C. Craig C. Kerr R.A. Suzuki H. Samuel A.D. Mazur E. Schafer W.R. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and implicated STR-33 in this function. To demonstrate that str-33 acts in these mechanosensory neurons, we performed a rescue experiment using a Pmec-4::str-33 fusion construct. As shown in Fig. 3C, microinjecting Pmec-4::str-33 into str-33(ykp001) mutants rescued the hyperactive egg-laying behavior of these mutants, increasing the number of unlaid eggs in uterus from 4.6 ± 1.6 to 11.7 ± 2.1 (n = 15). This transgene was expressed in several mechanosensory neurons, including PLMs, which regulate egg laying by transiently inhibiting HSN activity (11Zhang M. Chung S.H. Fang-Yen C. Craig C. Kerr R.A. Suzuki H. Samuel A.D. Mazur E. Schafer W.R. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that STR-33 could function to regulate egg laying in PLM neurons. MEC-4 is a component of DEG/ENaC proteins required to sense gentle mechanical touch as observed in mechanosensory neurons (22O'Hagan R. Chalfie M. Goodman M.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of MEC-4 protein (mec-4(d)) induces neuronal necrosis of mechanosensory neurons (23Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 24Bianchi L. Gerstbrein B. Fr⊘kjaer-Jensen C. Royal D.C. Mukherjee G. Royal M.A. Xue J. Schafer W.R. Driscoll M. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, mec-4(d) mutants showed a normal egg-laying phenotype (12.8 ± 1.9) (Fig. 3D) and locomotion rate (supplemental Fig. S3). To clarify whether the hyperactive egg-laying phenotype of str-33(ykp001) is linked to mechanosensory neurons, first, we prepared mec-4(d);str-33(ykp001) double mutants and counted unlaid eggs. The hyperactive egg-laying (11.6 ± 1.4) (Fig. 3D) and the locomotion defect phenotype of str-33(ykp001) mutant (supplemental Fig. S3) were suppressed by the mec-4(d) mutation, suggesting that STR-33 GPCR acts in mechanosensory neurons to regulate both egg-laying and locomotion behavior of C. elegans. Second, we performed an assay of gentle touch sensation to examine whether STR-33 GPCR is related to touch response of C. elegans. The mec-4(e1339) and mec-4(d) mutants showed defects in gentle touch when tested with an eyelash (supplemental Fig. S4). Both mec-4(e1339);str-33(ykp001) and mec-4(u231);str-33(ykp001) double mutants also exhibited gentle touch response defect, similar to mec-4(d) mutants, suggesting that STR-33 functions in parallel with gentle touch sensation in mechanosensory neurons (supplemental Fig. S4). Because ACh signaling is known to mediate egg-laying behavior, we tested whether the cholinergic agonist levamisole stimulated egg laying in str-33(ykp001) mutants. Levamisole stimulated egg laying at a low concentration but exerted no concentration-dependent effect and failed to restore egg laying to wild-type levels (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that STR-33 may be one of the GPCRs involved in cholinergic signaling that regulate egg-laying and locomotion in C. elegans. Given the fact that cholinergic neurotransmission is known to affect dauer larva formation (25Tissenbaum H.A. Hawdon J. Perregaux M. Hotez P. Guarente L. Ruvkun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and several cholinergic mutants exhibit a dauer-defective phenotype under certain assay conditions 6Jeeyong Lee and Young-Ki Paik, unpublished data. , we anticipated that str-33(ykp001) mutants might show defects in dauer formation. However, str-33(ykp001) mutants entered the dauer state very well in standard dauer formation assays (26Lee J. Kim K.Y. Lee J. Paik Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2930-2939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Jeong P.Y. Jung M. Yim Y.H. Kim H. Park M. Hong E. Lee W. Kim Y.H. Kim K. Paik Y.K. Nature. 2005; 433: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and showed normal dauer recovery (data not shown), suggesting that STR-33 may not be directly involved in the dauer signaling pathway, although it could be related to cholinergic signaling. GOA-1 signaling is known to regulate egg laying by reducing the expression of the tph-1 gene in HSNs. Consistent with this, we found that tph-1 expression was increased in goa-1(n1134) mutants (data not shown), as previously reported (10Tanis J.E. Moresco J.J. Lindquist R.A. Koelle M.R. Genetics. 2008; 178: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As a first step toward confirming whether the hyperactive egg-laying behavior of str-33(ykp001) mutants was due to changed tph-1 expression in HSNs, we transfected these animals with a tph-1::gfp construct. Similar to the results obtained in goa-1(n1134) mutants, tph-1 expression in HSNs was increased ∼2-fold in str-33(ykp001) mutants, indicating that loss of STR-33 function up-regulates 5-HT biosynthesis in HSNs (Fig. 4). The endogenous serotonin-deficient mutant tph-1(mg280) exhibited an Egl-d phenotype in which more eggs were observed in the uterus compared to wild type, indicating that 5-HT is a critical regulator of egg laying in C. elegans (28Sze J.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2102310779,"Picornaviruses contain stable RNA structures at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the RNA genome, OriL and OriR involved in viral RNA replication. The OriL RNA element found at the 5′ end of the enterovirus genome folds into a cloverleaf-like configuration. In vivo SELEX experiments revealed that functioning of the poliovirus cloverleaf depends on a specific structure in this RNA element. Little is known about the OriL of cardioviruses. Here, we investigated structural aspects and requirements of the apical loop of proximal stem-loop SL-A of mengovirus, a strain of EMCV. Using NMR spectroscopy, we showed that the mengovirus SL-A apical loop consists of an octaloop. In vivo SELEX experiments demonstrated that a large number of random sequences are tolerated in the apical octaloop that support virus replication. Mutants in which the SL-A loop size and the length of the upper part of the stem were varied showed that both stem-length and stability of the octaloop are important determinants for viral RNA replication and virus reproduction. Together, these data show that stem-loop A plays an important role in virus replication. The high degree of sequence flexibility and the lack of selective pressure on the octaloop argue against a role in sequence specific RNA-protein or RNA-RNA interactions in which octaloop nucleotides are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2065011510,"Author-supplied citations are a fraction of the related literature for a paper. The ""related citations"" on PubMed is typically dozens or hundreds of results long, and does not offer hints why these results are related. Using noun phrases derived from the sentences of the paper, we show it is possible to more transparently navigate to PubMed updates through search terms that can associate a paper with its citations. The algorithm to generate these search terms involved automatically extracting noun phrases from the paper using natural language processing tools, and ranking them by the number of occurrences in the paper compared to the number of occurrences on the web. We define search queries having at least one instance of overlap between the author-supplied citations of the paper and the top 20 search results as citation validated (CV). When the overlapping citations were written by same authors as the paper itself, we define it as CV-S and different authors is defined as CV-D. For a systematic sample of 883 papers on PubMed Central, at least one of the search terms for 86% of the papers is CV-D versus 65% for the top 20 PubMed ""related citations."" We hypothesize these quantities computed for the 20 million papers on PubMed to differ within 5% of these percentages. Averaged across all 883 papers, 5 search terms are CV-D, and 10 search terms are CV-S, and 6 unique citations validate these searches. Potentially related literature uncovered by citation-validated searches (either CV-S or CV-D) are on the order of ten per paper--many more if the remaining searches that are not citation-validated are taken into account. The significance and relationship of each search result to the paper can only be vetted and explained by a researcher with knowledge of or interest in that paper."
