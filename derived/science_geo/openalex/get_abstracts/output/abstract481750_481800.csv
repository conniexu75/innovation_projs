https://openalex.org/W2009308529,"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) has been identified as the most abundant internal modification of messenger RNA in eukaryotes. m(6)A modification is involved in cell fate determination in yeast and embryo development in plants. Its mammalian function remains unknown but thousands of mammalian mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) show m(6)A modification and m(6)A demethylases are required for mammalian energy homeostasis and fertility. We identify two proteins, the putative m(6)A MTase, methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3; ref. ), and a related but uncharacterized protein Mettl14, that function synergistically to control m(6)A formation in mammalian cells. Knockdown of Mettl3 and Mettl14 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) led to similar phenotypes, characterized by lack of m(6)A RNA methylation and lost self-renewal capability. A large number of transcripts, including many encoding developmental regulators, exhibit m(6)A methylation inversely correlated with mRNA stability and gene expression. The human antigen R (HuR) and microRNA pathways were linked to these effects. This gene regulatory mechanism operating in mESCs through m(6)A methylation is required to keep mESCs at their ground state and may be relevant to thousands of mRNAs and lncRNAs in various cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1984393349,"Anemia is one of the many complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the current prevalence of anemia in CKD patients in the United States is not known. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 were used to determine the prevalence of anemia in subjects with CKD. The analysis was limited to adults aged >18 who participated in both the interview and exam components of the survey. Three outcomes were assessed: the prevalence of CKD, the prevalence of anemia in subjects with CKD, and the self-reported treatment of anemia. CKD was classified into 5 stages based on the glomerular filtration rate and evidence of kidney damage, in accordance with the guidelines of the National Kidney Foundation. Anemia was defined as serum hemoglobin levels ≤12 g/dL in women and ≤13 g/dL in men. We found that an estimated 14.0% of the US adult population had CKD in 2007–2010. Anemia was twice as prevalent in people with CKD (15.4%) as in the general population (7.6%). The prevalence of anemia increased with stage of CKD, from 8.4% at stage 1 to 53.4% at stage 5. A total of 22.8% of CKD patients with anemia reported being treated for anemia within the previous 3 months–14.6% of patients at CKD stages 1–2 and 26.4% of patients at stages 3–4. These results update our knowledge of the prevalence and treatment of anemia in CKD in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2061312262,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig’s disease is a neurological disorder linked to environmental exposure to a non-protein amino acid, β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA). The only organisms reported to be BMAA-producing, are cyanobacteria – prokaryotic organisms. In this study, we demonstrate that diatoms – eukaryotic organisms – also produce BMAA. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry revealed the occurrence of BMAA in six investigated axenic diatom cultures. BMAA was also detected in planktonic field samples collected on the Swedish west coast that display an overrepresentation of diatoms relative to cyanobacteria. Given the ubiquity of diatoms in aquatic environments and their central role as primary producers and the main food items of zooplankton, the use of filter and suspension feeders as livestock fodder dramatically increases the risk of human exposure to BMAA-contaminated food."
https://openalex.org/W2070991372,"The ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases (TET1/2/3) converts 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and provides a vital mechanism for DNA demethylation. However, how TET proteins are regulated is largely unknown. Here we report that the O-linked β-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is not only a major TET3-interacting protein but also regulates TET3 subcellular localization and enzymatic activity. OGT catalyzes the O-GlcNAcylation of TET3, promotes TET3 nuclear export, and, consequently, inhibits the formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine catalyzed by TET3. Although TET1 and TET2 also interact with and can be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT, neither their subcellular localization nor their enzymatic activity are affected by OGT. Furthermore, we show that the nuclear localization and O-GlcNAcylation of TET3 are regulated by glucose metabolism. Our study reveals the differential regulation of TET family proteins by OGT and a novel link between glucose metabolism and DNA epigenetic modification.

Islands, start sites, gene bodies and beyond.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (3830) Google Scholar). As an epigenetic modification, DNA methylation has to be dynamic. Although the DNA methyltransferases that catalyze DNA methylation have been well studied (3.Chen T. Li E. Structure and function of eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases.Curr. Top. Dev.

In principle, DNA demethylation can be achieved through a replication-dependent passive mechanism involving inhibition of DNA maintenance methylation by DNMT1 during DNA replication and subsequent dilution through one or more rounds of mitosis (5.Ooi S.K. Bestor T.H. The colorful history of active DNA demethylation.Cell. 2008; 133: 1145-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DNA demethylation can be achieved through a replication-independent active mechanism that involves the enzymes removing the methyl group from 5mC or the enzymes converting 5mC to other forms of modified bases that can be subsequently removed from DNA by DNA damage repair pathways (5.Ooi S.K.

The recent discovery of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases has sparked great interest in DNA-active demethylation (7.Kriaucionis S. Heintz N.

All three TET proteins (Tet1/2/3) have the capacity to convert 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in a 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent manner (9.Ito S. D'Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K.

These derivative bases of 5hmC can be recognized by thymine DNA glycosylase, suggesting that TET proteins are able to initiate DNA demethylation through the base excision repair pathway (10.He Y.F.

In addition, because 5hmC is a poor template for DNMT1 (13.Valinluck V. Sowers L.C. Endogenous cytosine damage products alter the site selectivity of human DNA maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), TET proteins can also lead to DNA demethylation through the replication-dependent passive mechanism. The TET proteins are differentially expressed and exhibit both redundant and distinct functions (14.Dawlaty M.M. Breiling A. Le T. Raddatz G. Barrasa M.I. Cheng A.W. Gao Q. Powell B.E. Li Z. Xu M.

For example, TET1 and TET2 are highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and Purkinje neurons (7.Kriaucionis S. Heintz N.

Commun. 2011; 2: 241Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In ES cells, TET1 has been shown to have dual role in transcriptional activation and repression (17.Wu H. D'Alessio A.C. Ito S.

To better understand the regulation and function of TET proteins, various laboratories have carried out purification and characterization of TET-associated proteins. These efforts have led to identification of O-linked GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) as a protein associated with all three TET proteins (19.Chen Q. Chen Y. Bian C. Fujiki R. Yu X.

OGT transfers O-GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (23.Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W.

Site-specific interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation in cellular regulation.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2526-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). OGT catalyzes O-GlcNAcylation of a broad range of substrates, whereas O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the reverse reaction to remove the O-GlcNAc modification from the substrate proteins (25.Hart G.W.

In this regard, recent studies have revealed a role of histone H2B Ser-112 O-GlcNAc in the regulation of histone H2B Lys-120 ubiquitination and, consequently, in promoting transcriptional elongation (26.Sakabe K. Wang Z. Hart G.W. β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is part of the histone code.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 19915-19920Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 27.Fujiki R. Hashiba W.

GlcNAcylation of histone H2B facilitates its monoubiquitination.Nature. 2011; 480: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The functional importance of OGT is manifested by its essential roles in ES cell viability and mouse embryonic development (28.Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. The O-GlcNAc transferase gene resides on the X chromosome and is essential for embryonic stem cell viability and mouse ontogeny.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although OGT has been shown to interact with all three TET proteins and catalyze O-GlcNAcylation of TET1 and TET2, surprisingly, OGT was not found to significantly affect the activities of TET1/2/3 (19.Chen Q.

Rather, the TET1/2/3 proteins were shown to play critical roles in targeting OGT to chromatin and enhancing OGT enzymatic activity (19.Chen Q. Chen Y. Bian C. Fujiki R. Yu X.

In this study, we show that, although OGT associates and catalyzes the O-GlcNAcylation of all three TET proteins, it differentially regulates their subcellular localization and enzymatic activity. For expression by transient transfection, the full-length cDNAs of human TET1, TET2, TET3, and OGT were constructed by ligating various fragments amplified by PCR from human H9 ES cells and then cloned into the pcDNA3.1/3×Myc-A or pcDNA3.1-FLAG vector to express Myc- or FLAG-tagged proteins. The human OGT used in our study corresponds to OGT isoform 3. The H508 of this isoform of OGT is equivalent to the H498 in the catalytic center of the OGT isoform 1 (29.Lazarus M.B. Nam Y. Jiang J. Sliz P. Walker S. Structure of human O-GlcNAc transferase and its complex with a peptide substrate.Nature. 2011; 469: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of OGT and TET3 were generated by PCR amplification and then cloned into pEGFP-C2 or pcDNA3.1- FLAG, respectively. The OGT(H508A) mutant in pcDNA3.1/3×Myc-A was created by PCR-directed mutagenesis. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. The antibodies used were as follow: Myc (AbMART), GFP (AbMART), FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), Actin (HuaAn Corp.), and O-GlcNAc (Abcam, catalog no. ab2739, mouse monoclonal RL2 antibody). The anti-5hmC antibody was a gift from Dr. Degui Chen (Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (SIBCB), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)). HeLa and HEK293T cells were routinely maintained with regular DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of HeLa and HEK293T cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. HEK293T cells were transfected with either the control vector or FLAG-TET3. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and washed with PBS twice. The cells were lysed with EBC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 125 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with the addition of protease inhibitors. After removing cell debris by high-speed centrifugation, cell lysates were precleared with protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Then, the anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads were added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed five times with EBC buffer for 10 min each. SDS loading buffer was added directly to the beads and boiled for 5 min before samples were loaded and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Purified FLAG-TET3 and its associated proteins were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE for electrophoresis. The gel was fixed with 50% methanol at room temperature for 30 min, followed by further fixation with 5% methanol for 10 min. For staining, the gel was agitated in 50 ml of 32 μm DTT for 20 min, followed by incubation with 10−3g/ml AgNO3 for 20 min. After washing with double-distilled H2O, the gel was treated with 50 ml of image developer (3% Na2CO3, 25 μl 40% formaldehyde). The reaction was stopped using stop solution (12.5 ml acetic acid and 25g Tris in 500 ml of double-distilled H2O) when clear bands were observed. Protein identification by mass spectrometry was carried out in the Instrumental Analysis Center of Shanghai Jiaotong University. To determine the identities of the protein copurified with FLAG-TET3, the corresponding protein bands in the silver staining gel were excised and in-gel digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptide digests of the proteins were analyzed using an MDLC system (Michrom Bioresources Inc., Auburn, CA) coupled with a Thermo Finnigan two-dimensional linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQXL, Thermo Inc., San Jose, CA). The peptide sequences were determined by searching MS/MS spectra against the Human International Protein Index protein sequence database (IPI.Human.v3.63.fasta, 84,118 entries) by using the Turbo SEQUEST program in the BioWorks 3.3 software suite with a precursor ion mass tolerance of 2.0 Da and fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.0 Da. For immunofluorescence staining of 5hmC, HeLa cells were washed with iced 1× PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mm Na2HPO4) prior to fixation in 4% fresh paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Then, the cells were treated with 2 m HCl at room temperature for 30 min, followed by neutralizing with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 30 min and blocking with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator. The incubation with 5hmC primary antibody was carried out at 4 °C overnight, and secondary antibody incubation was performed at room temperature for 1 h. DNA was stained with DAPI. Images were acquired using a Leica SP5 system. For immunoprecipitation, HEK293T cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA). The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were then washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA) and then boiled in 1× SDS loading buffer. The eluted precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Given the functional significance of TET proteins in the regulation of DNA methylation and transcription, we wished to elucidate whether TET proteins function as protein complexes and how they are regulated. To this end, we expressed FLAG-tagged TET3 in 293T cells and carried out immunoaffinity purification of FLAG-TET3 and its associated proteins. A representative silver staining gel of purified FLAG-TET3 and its associated proteins is shown in Fig. 1A. In addition to the band corresponding to FLAG-TET3, a prominent band with a molecular mass of ∼110 kDa that was copurified with FLAG-TET3 was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. The majority of the identified peptide sequences matched with the sequence of human OGT (Fig. 1A). The interaction between TET3 and OGT was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) of FLAG-TET3 and Myc-OGT expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1B) as well as Myc-TET3 and FLAG-OGT expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1C). As a negative control, luciferase was associated neither with TET3 nor OGT. Thus, in agreement with a recent publication (20.Deplus R. Delatte B. Schwinn M.K. Defrance M. Méndez J. Murphy N.

TET2 and TET3 regulate GlcNAcylation and H3K4 methylation through OGT and SET1/COMPASS.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), our data identified OGT as a major TET3-associated protein. Although TET3 has been reported to interact with OGT (19.Chen Q. Chen Y. Bian C. Fujiki R. Yu X. TET2 promotes histone O-GlcNAcylation during gene transcription.Nature. 2013; 493: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 20.Deplus R. Delatte B. Schwinn M.K. Defrance M. Méndez J.

TET2 and TET3 regulate GlcNAcylation and H3K4 methylation through OGT and SET1/COMPASS.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), how these two proteins interact has not been investigated in detail. Thus, we wished to map the interaction domain(s) required for their interaction. We generated a series of FLAG-tagged TET3 deletion mutants (Fig. 1D, top panel) and analyzed their interaction with GFP-OGT, which was expressed better than Myc-tagged OGT, by co-IP assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, the OGT interaction region was mapped to the TET3 C-terminal dioxygenase domain (amino acids 1080–1660). OGT comprises two distinct regions: an N-terminal region consisting of a series of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) and a C-terminal region containing the catalytic activity (Fig. 1E, top panel) (29.Lazarus M.B. Nam Y. Jiang J. Sliz P. Walker S. Structure of human O-GlcNAc transferase and its complex with a peptide substrate.Nature. 2011; 469: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We generated a series of FLAG-tagged OGT deletion mutants (Fig. 1E, top panel) and examined their interaction with Myc-TET3 by co-IP. A representative result in Fig. 1E shows that, although IP of FLAG-OGT efficiently coprecipitated Myc-TET3, deletion of either the entire N-terminal TPR region or the first six TPR repeats substantially reduced the interaction of FLAG-OGT with Myc-TET3. Although FLAG-OGT with deletion of the C-terminal 146 amino acids (FLAG-OGTΔC) was expressed poorly, co-IP with Myc-TET3 could be observed at a reduced level in comparison with that of the full-length OGT. These results suggest that both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of OGT are required for an optimal interaction with TET3. In agreement with this idea, the TPR region alone coprecipitated with Myc-TET3, but at a much reduced level compared with the full-length OGT (Fig. 1E). Therefore, we conclude that both the N-terminal TPR and the C-terminal catalytic domain of OGT are required for the efficient interaction of OGT with TET3. Although TET3 has been reported in previous studies (19.Chen Q. Chen Y. Bian C. Fujiki R. Yu X. TET2 promotes histone O-GlcNAcylation during gene transcription.Nature. 2013; 493: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 20.Deplus R. Delatte B. Schwinn M.K. Defrance M. Méndez J.

To address this issue, we coexpressed Myc-tagged OGT, OGT with a H508A mutation in the catalytic domain that is equivalent to H498A in the OGT isoform 1 (29.Lazarus M.B. Nam Y. Jiang J. Sliz P. Walker S. Structure of human O-GlcNAc transferase and its complex with a peptide substrate.Nature. 2011; 469: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), or an OGTΔC mutant with deletion of the C-terminal amino acids 901–1046 with FLAG-TET3 in 293T cells. The correct expression of these proteins was verified by WB analysis (Fig. 2A, Input). FLAG-TET3 was then immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody and examined for O-GlcNAc modification by WB analysis using an anti-O-GlcNAc antibody. The results in Fig. 2A showed that coexpression of the wild type but not the OGTΔC mutant resulted in substantial O-GlcNAcylation of TET3. Coexpression of the OGT H508A mutant resulted in a low level of TET3 O-GlcNAcylation in comparison with that of the wild-type OGT, suggesting that the H508A mutant, although substantially impaired, possesses a residual O-GlcNAc transferase activity. To determine the O-GlcNAc modification site(s) of TET3, we coexpressed various FLAG-tagged TET3 deletion mutants with Myc-OGT. The TET3 deletion mutants were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and subsequent WB analysis using anti-O-GlcNAc antibody revealed O-GlcNAc of TET3 fragments of 1–680, 680-C, 680–1080, and 1080-C, but not the fragment of 1503-C (Fig. 2B), indicating that OGT is able to catalyze TET3 O-GlcNAcylation at multiple regions (sites). Having established that OGT interacts with and catalyzes O-GlcNAcylation of TET3, we next examined whether OGT regulates TET3 subcellular localization and/or enzymatic activity. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that, when expressed alone, Myc-TET3 exhibited a predominant nuclear staining pattern in HeLa cells (Fig. 2C). Consistent with previous studies (23.Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. Cloning and characterization of a unique O-GlcNAc transferase with multiple tetratricopeptide repeats.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 30.Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. Regulation of a cytosolic and nuclear O-GlcNAc transferase.

Strikingly, Myc-TET3 exhibited a predominant cytoplasmic localization when it was coexpressed with FLAG-OGT. This drastic effect on TET3 subcellular localization was dependent on OGT enzymatic activity because Myc-TET3 maintained a predominant nuclear localization when it was coexpressed with the enzymatically defective FLAG-OGTΔC mutant or the H508A mutant with impaired enzymatic activity (Fig. 2C). This effect of OGT on TET3 subcellular localization was also observed in 293T cells and mouse NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2D) and, thus, appears to be cell type-independent. We also noticed an increased cytoplasmic localization for FLAG-OGT when it was coexpressed with Myc-TET3 (Fig. 2C). We interpreted this result as a consequence of the interaction between FLAG-OGT and cytoplasmic Myc-TET3. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that OGT regulates TET3 subcellular localization in a manner depending on the enzymatic activity of OGT. To understand how OGT regulates TET3 subcellular localization, we first investigated the determinant(s) of TET3 nuclear localization. Sequence analysis revealed a potential nuclear localization sequence, KKRK (from amino acids 1607 to 1610), in the C-terminal region of human TET3 (Fig. 3A, top panel). This sequence is critically important for TET3 nuclear localization because mutation of a single amino acid, arginine 1609 to alanine (R1609A), completely abrogated TET3 nuclear localization (Fig. 3A). In further support of the importance of this sequence in TET3 nuclear localization, we observed that the TET3(N-1502) deletion mutant lacking the KKRK sequence is predominantly cytoplasmic, w"

During studies of probiotic bacteria and obesity, we discovered that male mice routinely consuming purified lactic acid bacteria originally isolated from human milk had larger testicles and increased serum testosterone levels compared to their age-matched controls. Further investigation using microscopy-assisted histomorphometry of testicular tissue showed that mice consuming Lactobacillus reuteri in their drinking water had significantly increased seminiferous tubule cross-sectional profiles and increased spermatogenesis and Leydig cell numbers per testis when compared with matched diet counterparts This showed that criteria of gonadal aging were reduced after routinely consuming a purified microbe such as L. reuteri. We tested whether these features typical of sustained reproductive fitness may be due to anti-inflammatory properties of L. reuteri, and found that testicular mass and other indicators typical of old age were similarly restored to youthful levels using systemic administration of antibodies blocking pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A. This indicated that uncontrolled host inflammatory responses contributed to the testicular atrophy phenotype in aged mice. Reduced circulating testosterone levels have been implicated in many adverse effects; dietary L. reuteri or other probiotic supplementation may provide a viable natural approach to prevention of male hypogonadism, absent the controversy and side-effects of traditional therapies, and yield practical options for management of disorders typically associated with normal aging. These novel findings suggest a potential high impact for microbe therapy in public health by imparting hormonal and gonad features of reproductive fitness typical of much younger healthy individuals."

However, mice remained hyperglycemic, which was associated with up-regulation of gluconeogenesis gene expression as well as decreased glycolysis and glycogen synthesis gene expression. Furthermore, glycogen synthase activity and glycogen accumulation were significantly reduced.

The present study was designed to develop and evaluate the chitosan-graft-polyethylenimine (CP)/DNA nanoparticles as novel non-viral gene vectors for gene therapy of osteoarthritis. The CP/DNA nanoparticles were produced through a complex coacervation of the cationic polymers with pEGFP after grafting chitosan (CS) with a low molecular weight (Mw) PEI (Mw = 1.8 kDa). Particle size and zeta potential were related to the weight ratio of CP:DNA, where decreases in nanoparticle size and increases in surface charge were observed as CP content increased. The buffering capacity of CP was significantly greater than that of CS. The transfection efficiency of CP/DNA nanoparticles was similar with that of the Lipofectamine™ 2000, and significantly higher than that of CS/DNA and PEI (25 kDa)/DNA nanoparticles. The transfection efficiency of the CP/DNA nanoparticles was dependent on the weight ratio of CP:DNA (w/w). The average cell viability after the treatment with CP/DNA nanoparticles was over 90% in both chondrocytes and synoviocytes, which was much higher than that of PEI (25 kDa)/DNA nanoparticles. The CP copolymers efficiently carried the pDNA inside chondrocytes and synoviocytes, and the pDNA was detected entering into nucleus. These results suggest that CP/DNA nanoparticles with improved transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity might be a safe and efficient non-viral vector for gene delivery to both chondrocytes and synoviocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2008075204,"Catalase is an iron porphyrin enzyme, which serves as an efficient scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to avoid oxidative damage. In sugarcane, the enzymatic activity of catalase in a variety (Yacheng05-179) resistant to the smut pathogen Sporisorium scitamineum was always higher than that of the susceptible variety (Liucheng03-182), suggesting that catalase activity may have a positive correlation with smut resistance in sugarcane. To understand the function of catalase at the molecular level, a cDNA sequence of ScCAT1 (GenBank Accession No. KF664183), was isolated from sugarcane infected by S. scitamineum. ScCAT1 was predicted to encode 492 amino acid residues, and its deduced amino acid sequence shared a high degree of homology with other plant catalases. Enhanced growth of ScCAT1 in recombinant Escherichia coli Rosetta cells under the stresses of CuCl2, CdCl2 and NaCl indicated its high tolerance. Q-PCR results showed that ScCAT1 was expressed at relatively high levels in the bud, whereas expression was moderate in stem epidermis and stem pith. Different kinds of stresses, including S. scitamineum challenge, plant hormones (SA, MeJA and ABA) treatments, oxidative (H2O2) stress, heavy metal (CuCl2) and hyper-osmotic (PEG and NaCl) stresses, triggered a significant induction of ScCAT1. The ScCAT1 protein appeared to localize in plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Furthermore, histochemical assays using DAB and trypan blue staining, as well as conductivity measurement, indicated that ScCAT1 may confer the sugarcane immunity. In conclusion, the positive response of ScCAT1 to biotic and abiotic stresses suggests that ScCAT1 is involved in protection of sugarcane against reactive oxidant-related environmental stimuli."

A PG dl-carboxypeptidase Pgp1 essential for maintenance of C. jejuni helical shape was recently identified. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the CJJ81176_0915 gene product as co-occurring with Pgp1 in several organisms. Deletion of cjj81176_0915 (renamed pgp2) resulted in straight morphology, representing the second C. jejuni gene affecting cell shape. The PG structure of a Δpgp2 mutant showed an increase in tetrapeptide-containing muropeptides and a complete absence of tripeptides, consistent with ld-carboxypeptidase activity, which was confirmed biochemically. PG analysis of a Δpgp1Δpgp2 double mutant demonstrated that Pgp2 activity is required to generate the tripeptide substrate for Pgp1. Loss of pgp2 affected several pathogenic properties; the deletion strain was defective for motility in semisolid agar, biofilm formation, and fluorescence on calcofluor white. Δpgp2 PG also caused decreased stimulation of the human nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1) proinflammatory mediator in comparison with wild type, as expected from the reduction in muropeptide tripeptides (the primary Nod1 agonist) in the mutant; however, these changes did not alter the ability of the Δpgp2 mutant strain to survive within human epithelial cells or to elicit secretion of IL-8 from epithelial cells after infection.

The pathogens C. jejuni and Helicobacter pylori are the most well studied members of the ϵ-Proteobacteria, a relatively poorly characterized class of a wide variety of bacteria, including numerous extremophiles. Most members of the ϵ-Proteobacteria examined to date display helical or curved morphology (6.Garrity G.M. Bell J.A. Lilburn T. Order I. Campylobacterales ord. nov.in: Garrity G.M. Brenner D.J.

This is also the case for C. jejuni because deletion of the C. jejuni PG dl-carboxypeptidase Pgp1 (peptidoglycan peptidase 1) resulted in loss of helical shape and alterations in a number of stress survival and host-related attributes (11.Frirdich E.

CFW is a compound reacting with β1–3 and β1–4 carbohydrate linkages and fluoresces under long wave UV light (12.Rattee I.D. Breur M.M. The Physical Chemistry of Dye Absorption.

The C. jejuni carbohydrate involved in CFW hypo- versus hyper-reactivity has not been clarified, although it has been shown not to directly correlate with the characterized C. jejuni cell surface polysaccharides: the capsular polysaccharide, lipooligosaccharide, O-linked flagellar glycoproteins, or N-linked glycoproteins (14.McLennan M.K.

Despite having changes in PG composition and cell morphology, the rod-shaped Δpgp1 mutant showed no apparent differences in comparison with wild type in other cell surface structures, growth characteristics, stress survival, and antimicrobial compound sensitivity. The rod-shaped Δpgp1 was altered in all aspects of the C. jejuni life cycle: transmission (with reduced motility in semisolid agar and decreased biofilm formation), colonization (exhibiting a 3 log-fold reduction in chick colonization), and host cell interactions (increased activation of the cytoplasmic human nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1) receptor by Δpgp1 PG and increased secretion of the IL-8 chemokine in epithelial cell infections). Surprisingly, the Δpgp1 mutant was not defective for host cell attachment or invasion in vitro even in the presence of media of higher viscosity, although this may not hold true in vivo in intestinal mucus. peptidoglycan calcofluor white nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain N-acetylmuramic acid penicillin-binding protein Mueller-Hinton kanamycin transmission electron microscopy muramyldipeptide diaminopimelic acid carboxymethylcellulose. We are just beginning to understand fundamental aspects of PG structure and biosynthesis in this important human pathogen, along with the unique factors involved in sculpting its helical morphology. The PG of C. jejuni and all Gram-negative organisms is composed of glycan strands of alternating precursors of β1–4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues, which are connected by short peptides. The peptides are synthesized as pentapeptides (l-Ala-d-isoglutamic acid-meso-DAP-d-Ala-d-Ala), which can be cross-linked to dimers or oligomers by dd-transpeptidases or trimmed to tetra-, tri-, or dipeptides by dd-, ld-, and dl-carboxypeptidases, respectively. The mature PG is composed of a mixture of subunits called muropeptides that differ in the number and length of connected peptides. The muropeptide profile of C. jejuni indicates very low levels of pentapeptides and a high abundance of trimmed stem peptide species (11.Frirdich E. Biboy J. Adams C. Lee J. Ellermeier J. Gielda L.D.

Bioinformatic analyses identified three putative penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) or PG synthases in C. jejuni: CJJ81176_0536 with similarity to the bifunctional synthase PBP1A encoding PG glycosyltransferase and dd-transpeptidase domains and CJJ81176_0680 and CJJ81176_0550 with homology to the monofunctional transpeptidases PBP2 (involved in cell elongation) and PBP3 (involved in cell division), respectively. PG biosynthesis also requires the activity of hydrolases, allowing for the insertion of newly attached material in cell elongation and the separation of cells in cell division (8.Matteï P.J. Neves D.

This study describes the identification and characterization of the C. jejuni ld-carboxypeptidase Pgp2 (peptidoglycan peptidase 2). Pgp2 trims tetrapeptides to tripeptides and creates the substrate for Pgp1, with both enzyme activities required for C. jejuni helical morphology. The importance of Pgp2 in a number of properties related to pathogenesis is also described, most notably its role in motility, the capacity to form biofilms, the manner in which C. jejuni is recognized by human cells, and its ability to colonize a zoonotic avian host. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study and their construction are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Unless otherwise stated, C. jejuni strains were grown at 38 °C in Mueller-Hinton (MH; Oxoid) broth or 8.5% (w/v) agar supplemented with vancomycin (10 μg/ml) and trimethoprim (5 μg/ml) (unless otherwise indicated) under microaerobic/capnophilic conditions (6% O2, 12% CO2) in a Sanyo trigas incubator for plates or using the Oxoid CampyGen system for broth cultures. Growth media were supplemented with chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) or kanamycin (Km; 50 μg/ml) where appropriate. Escherichia coli strains used for plasmid construction were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB; Sigma) broth or 7.5% agar (w/v) and supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml), or Km (25 μg/ml), as necessary. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on samples fixed in a final concentration of 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde from overnight broth cultures, as described previously (11.Frirdich E. Biboy J. Adams C. Lee J. Ellermeier J. Gielda L.D. Dirita V.J. Girardin S.E. Vollmer W. Gaynor E.C. Peptidoglycan-modifying enzyme Pgp1 is required for helical cell shape and pathogenicity traits in Campylobacter jejuni.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002602Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Samples were visualized on a Hitachi H7600 TEM equipped with a side mount AMT Advantage (1-megapixel) CCD camera (Hamamatsu ORCA) at the UBC Bioimaging facility (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). Phenotypic assays were carried out with strains that had been grown in shaking MH-trimethoprim-vancomycin broth for 18 h. Motility, biofilm formation, and CFW fluorescence were assayed as described previously (11.Frirdich E. Biboy J. Adams C. Lee J. Ellermeier J. Gielda L.D. Dirita V.J. Girardin S.E. Vollmer W. Gaynor E.C.

C. jejuni strains were passaged once from frozen stocks and then passaged to 20–25 MH plates and grown for 20 h to obtain log phase bacteria at a final OD of 200–600. Cells were collected into cold MH broth by scraping, harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min, and then resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold H2O. Cells were lysed by dropwise addition to 6 ml of 8% SDS boiling under reflux. PG was purified from the cell lysate as described (19.Glauner B. Separation and quantification of muropeptides with high-performance liquid chromatography.Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For muropeptide analysis, the isolated PG was digested with the muramidase cellosyl (kindly provided by Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany), and the resulting muropeptides were reduced with sodium borohydride and separated by HPLC, as described (19.Glauner B. Separation and quantification of muropeptides with high-performance liquid chromatography.Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Muropeptide structures were assigned (i) based on comparison with retention times of known muropeptides from C. jejuni (11.Frirdich E. Biboy J. Adams C. Lee J. Ellermeier J. Gielda L.D. Dirita V.J.

For MS analysis, muropeptide fractions were collected, concentrated in a SpeedVac, acidified by 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by offline electrospray mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, Bremen, Germany) at the Newcastle University Pinnacle facility as described (20.Bui N.K. Gray J. Schwarz H. Schumann P. Blanot D. Vollmer W. The peptidoglycan sacculus of Myxococcus xanthus has unusual structural features and is degraded during glycerol-induced myxospore development.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The C. jejuni 81-176 pgp2 gene was cloned for expression in E. coli without its signal peptide (amino acids 19–325 of the protein) and stop codon, in frame with the C-terminal His6 tag of the pET28a vector, generating plasmid pEF70. A detailed description of the cloning of the expression construct, expression, and purification protocol is included in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. For enzyme assays, the purified protein was dialyzed against 0.05 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 m NaCl and 20% glycerol. Purified Δpgp2 PG (1 mg/ml) was incubated with Pgp2-His6 (5 μm) in 0.02 m NaH2PO4, pH 4.8, 0.1 m NaCl for 4 h at 37 °C on a Thermomixer at 750 rpm. A control sample received no enzyme. The samples were incubated with 10 μg of cellosyl (Hoechst, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) for 18 h, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged at room temperature for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The muropeptides present in the supernatant were reduced with sodium borohydride and analyzed by HPLC, as described (19.Glauner B. Separation and quantification of muropeptides with high-performance liquid chromatography.Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The human epithelial cell lines CaCo2 and INT407 were used for C. jejuni infections. Medium used for growth of the cell lines was as directed by the ATCC. Cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates at semiconfluence at ∼5 × 105 and ∼1 × 105 cells/ml for CaCo2 and INT407 cells, respectively. Infections were carried out as described (11.Frirdich E. Biboy J. Adams C. Lee J. Ellermeier J. Gielda L.D. Dirita V.J. Girardin S.E. Vollmer W. Gaynor E.C.

To test the levels of invasion in media of higher viscosity to mimic intestinal mucus, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) (Sigma) was used. Infections were carried out as above using the INT407 cell line. The bacterial inoculum was added in MEM containing 0, 0.6 (141 centipoise (cP)), 1, and 2% CMC. Levels of adhered and invaded bacteria at the 1 and 3 h time points were determined by washing and lysing the cells and plating for cfu/ml as described (11.Frirdich E. Biboy J. Adams C. Lee J.

Luciferase assays were performed as described (21.Lee J. Tattoli I. Wojtal K.A. Vavricka S.R. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. pH-dependent internalization of muramyl peptides from early endosomes enables Nod1 and Nod2 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23818-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with 75 ng of NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (Igκ-luc, Invitrogen) and either human Nod1 (2 ng) or Nod2 (0.3 ng). The empty vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen) was used to balance the transfected DNA concentration. At the same time, either 0.2 or 2 μg of C. jejuni 81-176, Δpgp2, or Δpgp2c PG muropeptides were added, and the NFκB-dependent luciferase activation was then measured following 18–24 h of co-incubation. To generate muropeptides, a 2 mg/ml stock of PG of each strain was digested with mutanolysin at 125 units/100 μl overnight at 38 °C. Positive controls were tripeptide l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP (5 μg/ml) and muramyldipeptide (MDP) (10 μg/ml) for Nod1 and Nod2 assays, respectively. Data are representative of four independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. The concentration of IL-8 secreted by INT407 human epithelial cells either left uninfected or infected with C. jejuni wild-type strain 81-176, Δpgp2, or Δpgp2c was assayed using the human IL-8 ELISA kit (Invitrogen) as described previously (11.Frirdich E.

Seven days postcolonization, cecal contents were removed, diluted in PBS, and plated on Campylobacter-selective media (MH agar supplemented with vancomycin (40 μg/ml), trimethoprim (10 μg/ml), cefoparazone (40 μg/ml), and cyclohexamide (100 μg/ml)) and allowed to grow at 42 °C under microaerobic conditions until countable colonies appeared (∼2–3 days). cfu counts were standardized to g of cecal content. Chicken experiments were carried out under protocol 10462 approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Care and Use of Animals. To discover additional C. jejuni proteins involved in maintaining helical shape, putative protein interaction partners for Pgp1 were identified bioinformatically by STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) analysis. The pgp1 (cjj81176_1344) gene product was found to be associated with high confidence to cjj81176_0915 by their co-occurrence in numerous organisms. In addition, the two genes were found to be in the immediate neighborhood of each other (within 300 bp) on the genome in the ϵ-Proteobacteria Nitratiruptor sp. SB155 and Nautilia profundicola, the δ-Proteobacterium Desulfococcus deovorans, and a member of the Aquificae Persephonella marina. The 0915 gene was named pgp2 (peptidoglycan peptidase 2) to describe its function and identification as the second C. jejuni PG peptidase to be characterized. Pgp2 is a 325-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 37.8 kDa that was annotated as a hypothetical protein. It has a predicted N-terminal signal sequence by SIGNALP that is cleaved between amino acids 18 and 19. Conserved domain searches and the threading program PHYRE identified a ld-transpeptidase-like catalytic domain (YkuD; pfam0734) spanning amino acids 67–196. In other organisms, ld-transpeptidases have been shown to give rise to an alternative type of PG cross-linking between the third amino acid (meso-DAP) residues of the stem peptides and are involved in attaching the outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp to the PG sacculus. However, neither meso-DAP-meso-DAP cross-links nor bound lipoproteins have been identified in C. jejuni (11.Frirdich E. Biboy J. Adams C. Lee J. Ellermeier J. Gielda L.D. Dirita V.J. Girardin S.E.

Peptidoglycan-modifying enzyme Pgp1 is required for helical cell shape and pathogenicity traits in Campylobacter jejuni.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002602Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that Pgp2 might catalyze a different reaction. Unlike pgp1, the pgp2 gene product is not restricted to helical and vibrioid bacteria and is conserved in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. The H. pylori homolog is described by Sycuro et al. (24.Sycuro L.K. Rule C.S. Petersen T.W. Sessler T. Nagarkar D.B. Khalid F. Wyckoff T.J. Pincus Z. Biboy J. Vollmer W. van den Engh G. Salama N.R. Flow cytometry based enrichment for cell shape mutants identifies multiple genes that influence Helicobacter pylori morphology.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 90: 869-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A putative alanine racemase gene (alr) is encoded directly downstream of pgp2 in C. jejuni strain 81-176 (Fig. 1A). Alr catalyzes the conversion of l- to d-Ala, an essential component of the PG stem peptide. To study the role of pgp2 in C. jejuni PG biosynthesis and morphology, we initially constructed a deletion mutant in strain 81-176 by replacing a portion of the gene with a non-polar aphA3 Km resistance cassette. This produced a strain with completely straight morphology but also modest growth defects (data not shown). The characteristic C. jejuni helical cell shape, but not the growth defects, could be complemented by insertion of the pRRC-pgp2 (pJV4) complementing plasmid construct (Fig. 1A). This suggested minor polar activity on alr (predicted to be essential), which was confirmed by full complementation of this initial pgp2 mutant with a pRRC derivative carrying both pgp2 and the downstream alr (not shown). We thus decided to construct an unmarked, in-frame deletion of pgp2. An aphA3(Km)-sacB cassette adapted for H. pylori (pKSFII) (25.Copass M. Grandi G. Rappuoli R. Introduction of unmarked mutations in the Helicobacter pylori vacA gene with a sucrose sensitivity marker.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1949-1952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was first used to create a marked deletion of pgp2. We have now confirmed alr deletion to be lethal but also fully rescued by supplementation of growth medium with d-Ala. 6E. Frirdich, J. Vermeulen, and E. C. Gaynor, unpublished observations. The aphA3(Km)-sacB-disrupted pgp2 mutant strain only grew on plates containing d-Ala, indicating full polar effects on alr. Although sucrose counterselection proved unsuccessful, we reasoned that growth without d-Ala could be used instead as a counterselection for the creation of an unmarked in-frame deletion. Transformants with the aphA3-sacB cassette replaced by an in-frame deletion of pgp2 were selected by growth on media without d-Ala to create strain Δpgp2 (Fig. 1A). The complemented strain created by integration of pRRC carrying pgp2 (pJV4) into the rRNA spacer region of Δpgp2 is designated Δpgp2c (Fig. 1A). A Δpgp1Δpgp2 double mutant was also generated to examine the loss of both genes upon C. jejuni PG biosyn"

Previous evidence indicates that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)-derived MVs can modulate endothelial cell survival and proliferation. In this study, we evaluated whether EPC-MVs protect cardiomyocytes (CMs) against angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy and apoptosis. The H9c2 CMs were exposed to Ang II in the presence or absence of EPC-MVs. Cell viability, apoptosis, surface area and β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) expression were analyzed. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species (ROS), serine/threonine kinase (Akt), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and their phosphorylated proteins (p-Akt, p-eNOS) were measured. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and NOS inhibitors were used for pathway verification. The role of MV-carried RNAs in mediating these effects was also explored. Results showed 1) EPC-MVs were able to protect CMs against Ang II-induced changes in cell viability, apoptosis, surface area, β-MHC expression and ROS over-production; 2) The effects were accompanied with the up-regulation of Akt/p-Akt and its downstream eNOS/p-eNOS, and were abolished by PI3K inhibition or partially blocked by NOS inhibition; 3) Depletion of RNAs from EPC-MVs partially or totally eliminated the effects of EPC-MVs. Our data indicate that EPC-MVs protect CMs from hypertrophy and apoptosis through activating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway via the RNAs carried by EPC-MVs."

Although there is solid evidence that SERT forms oligomeric complexes, the exact stoichiometry of the complexes and the fractions of different coexisting oligomeric states still remain enigmatic. Here we used single molecule fluorescence microscopy to obtain the oligomerization state of the SERT via brightness analysis of single diffraction-limited fluorescent spots. Heterologously expressed SERT was labeled either with the fluorescent inhibitor JHC 1-64 or via fusion to monomeric GFP. We found a variety of oligomerization states of membrane-associated transporters, revealing molecular associations larger than dimers and demonstrating the coexistence of different degrees of oligomerization in a single cell; the data are in agreement with a linear aggregation model. Furthermore, oligomerization was found to be independent of SERT surface density, and oligomers remained stable over several minutes in the live cell plasma membrane. Together, the results indicate kinetic trapping of preformed SERT oligomers at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2047470590,"Numerous bacteria have evolved different iron uptake systems with the ability to make use of their own and heterologous siderophores. However, there is growing evidence attributing alternative roles for siderophores that might explain the potential adaptive advantages of microorganisms having multiple siderophore systems. In this work, we show the requirement of the siderophore enterobactin for Escherichia coli colony development in minimal media. We observed that a strain impaired in enterobactin production (entE mutant) was unable to form colonies on M9 agar medium meanwhile its growth was normal on LB agar medium. Given that, neither iron nor citrate supplementation restored colony growth, the role of enterobactin as an iron uptake-facilitator would not explain its requirement for colony development. The absence of colony development was reverted either by addition of enterobactin, the reducing agent ascorbic acid or by incubating in anaerobic culture conditions with no additives. Then, we associated the enterobactin requirement for colony development with its ability to reduce oxidative stress, which we found to be higher in media where the colony development was impaired (M9) compared with media where the strain was able to form colonies (LB). Since oxyR and soxS mutants (two major stress response regulators) formed colonies in M9 agar medium, we hypothesize that enterobactin could be an important piece in the oxidative stress response repertoire, particularly required in the context of colony formation. In addition, we show that enterobactin has to be hydrolyzed after reaching the cell cytoplasm in order to enable colony development. By favoring iron release, hydrolysis of the enterobactin-iron complex, not only would assure covering iron needs, but would also provide the cell with a molecule with exposed hydroxyl groups (hydrolyzed enterobactin). This molecule would be able to scavenge radicals and therefore reduce oxidative stress."

A novel α4/7-conotoxin, α-CTxLvIA, was cloned from Conus lividus. Its pharmacological profile at Xenopus laevis oocyte-expressed rat nAChR subtypes was determined by 2-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology, and its 3-dimensional (3D) structure was determined by NMR spectroscopy. α-CTx LvIA is a 16-aa C-terminally-amidated peptide with 2-disulfide bridges. Using rat subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we found the highest affinity of α-CTxLvIA was for α3β2 nAChRs (IC50 8.7 nM), where blockade was reversible within 2 min. IC50 values were >100 nM at α6/α3β2β3, α6/α3β4, and α3β4 nAChRs, and ≥3 μM at all other subtypes tested. α3β2 vs. α6β2 subtype selectivity was confirmed for human-subunit nAChRs with much greater preference (300-fold) for α3β2 over α6β2 nAChRs. This is the first α-CTx reported to show high selectivity for human α3β2 vs. α6β2 nAChRs. α-CTxLvIA adopts two similarly populated conformations water: one (assumed to be bioactive) is highly structured, whereas the other is mostly random coil in nature. Selectivity differences with the similarly potent, but less selective, α3β2 nAChR antagonist α-CTx PeIA probably reside within the three residues, which differ in loop 2, given their otherwise similar 3D structures. α4/7-CTx LvIA is a new, potent, selective α3β2 nAChR antagonist, which will enable detailed studies of α3β2 nAChR structure, function, and physiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W1982091915,"Background Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of mortality in young children. Diarrheal pathogens are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and for children the majority of this transmission is thought to occur within the home. However, very few studies have documented enteric pathogens within households of low-income countries. Methods and Findings The presence of molecular markers for three enteric viruses (enterovirus, adenovirus, and rotavirus), seven Escherichia coli virulence genes (ECVG), and human-specific Bacteroidales was assessed in hand rinses and household stored drinking water in Bagamoyo, Tanzania. Using a matched case-control study design, we examined the relationship between contamination of hands and water with these markers and child diarrhea. We found that the presence of ECVG in household stored water was associated with a significant decrease in the odds of a child within the home having diarrhea (OR = 0.51; 95% confidence interval 0.27–0.93). We also evaluated water management and hygiene behaviors. Recent hand contact with water or food was positively associated with detection of enteric pathogen markers on hands, as was relatively lower volumes of water reportedly used for daily hand washing. Enteropathogen markers in stored drinking water were more likely found among households in which the markers were also detected on hands, as well as in households with unimproved water supply and sanitation infrastructure. Conclusions The prevalence of enteric pathogen genes and the human-specific Bacteroidales fecal marker in stored water and on hands suggests extensive environmental contamination within homes both with and without reported child diarrhea. Better stored water quality among households with diarrhea indicates caregivers with sick children may be more likely to ensure safe drinking water in the home. Interventions to increase the quantity of water available for hand washing, and to improve food hygiene, may reduce exposure to enteric pathogens in the domestic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2009476233,"Tail-Anchored (TA) proteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of yeast cells via the posttranslational Guided Entry of Tail-Anchored protein (GET) pathway. The key component of this targeting machinery is the ATPase Get3 that docks to the ER membrane by interacting with a receptor complex formed by the proteins Get1 and Get2. A conserved pathway is present in higher eukaryotes and is mediated by TRC40, homolog of Get3, and the recently identified membrane receptors WRB and CAML. Here, we used yeast lacking the GET1 and GET2 genes and substituted them with WRB and CAML. This rescued the growth phenotypes of the GET receptor mutant. We demonstrate that WRB and CAML efficiently recruit Get3 to the ER membrane and promote the targeting of the TA proteins in vivo. Our results show that the membrane spanning segments of CAML are essential to create a functional receptor with WRB and to ensure TA protein membrane insertion. Finally, we determined the binding parameters of TRC40 to the WRB/CAML receptor. We conclude that together, WRB and CAML are not only necessary but also sufficient to create a functional membrane receptor complex for TRC40. The yeast complementation assay can be used to further dissect the structure-function relationship of the WRB/CAML heteromultimer in the absence of endogenous receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2019036532,"Background Performing chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) isolation is considered a major challenge among different plant groups, especially conifers. Isolating chloroplasts in conifers by such conventional methods as sucrose gradient and high salt has not been successful. So far, plastid genome sequencing protocols for conifer species have been based mainly on long-range PCR, which is known to be time-consuming and difficult to implement. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a protocol for cpDNA isolation using three different conifer families: Araucaria angustifolia and Araucaria bidwilli (Araucariaceae), Podocarpus lambertii (Podocarpaceae) and Pinus patula (Pinaceae). The present protocol is based on high salt isolation buffer followed by saline Percoll gradient. Combining these two strategies allowed enhanced chloroplast isolation, along with decreased contamination caused by polysaccharides, polyphenols, proteins, and nuclear DNA in cpDNA. Microscopy images confirmed the presence of intact chloroplasts in high abundance. This method was applied to cpDNA isolation and subsequent sequencing by Illumina MiSeq (2×250 bp), using only 50 ng of cpDNA. Reference-guided chloroplast genome mapping showed that high average coverage was achieved for all evaluated species: 24.63 for A. angustifolia, 135.97 for A. bidwilli, 1196.10 for P. lambertii, and 64.68 for P. patula. Conclusion Results show that this improved protocol is suitable for enhanced quality and yield of chloroplasts and cpDNA isolation from conifers, providing a useful tool for studies that require isolated chloroplasts and/or whole cpDNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2086287378,"Intracellular signaling involving hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) controls the adaptive responses to hypoxia. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that intracellular signals encode temporal information. Thus, the dynamics of protein levels, as well as protein quantity and/or localization, impacts on cell fate. We hypothesized that such temporal encoding has a role in HIF signaling and cell fate decisions triggered by hypoxic conditions. Using live cell imaging in a controlled oxygen environment, we observed transient 3-h pulses of HIF-1α and -2α expression under continuous hypoxia. We postulated that the well described prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) oxygen sensors and HIF negative feedback regulators could be the origin of the pulsatile HIF dynamics. We used iterative mathematical modeling and experimental analysis to scrutinize which parameter of the PHD feedback could control HIF timing and we probed for the functional redundancy between the three main PHD proteins. We identified PHD2 as the main PHD responsible for HIF peak duration. We then demonstrated that this has important consequences, because the transient nature of the HIF pulse prevents cell death by avoiding transcription of p53-dependent pro-apoptotic genes. We have further shown the importance of considering HIF dynamics for coupling mathematical models by using a described HIF-p53 mathematical model. Our results indicate that the tight control of HIF transient dynamics has important functional consequences on the cross-talk with key signaling pathways controlling cell survival, which is likely to impact on HIF targeting strategies for hypoxia-associated diseases such as tumor progression and ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1968957083,"The apical complex is one of the defining features of apicomplexan parasites, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium, where it mediates host penetration and invasion. The apical complex is also known in a few related lineages, including several non-parasitic heterotrophs, where it mediates feeding behaviour. The origin of the apical complex is unclear, and one reason for this is that in apicomplexans it exists in only part of the life cycle, and never simultaneously with other major cytoskeletal structures like flagella and basal bodies. Here, we used conventional TEM and serial TEM tomography to reconstruct the three dimensional structure of the apical complex in Psammosa pacifica, a predatory relative of apicomplexans and dinoflagellates that retains the archetype apical complex and the flagellar apparatus simultaneously. The P. pacifica apical complex is associated with the gullet and consists of the pseudoconoid, micronemes, and electron dense vesicles. The pseudoconoid is a convex sheet consisting of eight short microtubules, plus a band made up of microtubules that originate from the flagellar apparatus. The flagellar apparatus consists of three microtubular roots. One of the microtubular roots attached to the posterior basal body is connected to bypassing microtubular strands, which are themselves connected to the extension of the pseudoconoid.

PGC-1α mRNA levels are reduced in a number of neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to disease pathogenesis, since increased levels ameliorate behavioral defects and neuropathology of Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. PGC-1α and its downstream targets are reduced both in postmortem brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in transgenic mouse models of AD. Therefore, we investigated whether increased expression of PGC-1α would exert beneficial effects in the Tg19959 transgenic mouse model of AD; Tg19959 mice express the human amyloid precursor gene (APP) with 2 familial AD mutations and develop increased β-amyloid levels, plaque deposition, and memory deficits by 2-3 mo of age. Rather than an improvement, the cross of the Tg19959 mice with mice overexpressing human PGC-1α exacerbated amyloid and tau accumulation. This was accompanied by an impairment of proteasome activity. PGC-1α overexpression induced mitochondrial abnormalities, neuronal cell death, and an exacerbation of behavioral hyperactivity in the Tg19959 mice. These findings show that PGC-1α overexpression exacerbates the neuropathological and behavioral deficits that occur in transgenic mice with mutations in APP that are associated with human AD."
https://openalex.org/W2014451752,"The R2TP is a recently identified Hsp90 co-chaperone, composed of four proteins as follows: Pih1D1, RPAP3, and the AAA(+)-ATPases RUVBL1 and RUVBL2. In mammals, the R2TP is involved in the biogenesis of cellular machineries such as RNA polymerases, small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases. Here, we characterize the spaghetti (spag) gene of Drosophila, the homolog of human RPAP3. This gene plays an essential function during Drosophila development. We show that Spag protein binds Drosophila orthologs of R2TP components and Hsp90, like its yeast counterpart. Unexpectedly, Spag also interacts and stimulates the chaperone activity of Hsp70. Using null mutants and flies with inducible RNAi, we show that spaghetti is necessary for the stabilization of snoRNP core proteins and target of rapamycin activity and likely the assembly of RNA polymerase II. This work highlights the strong conservation of both the HSP90/R2TP system and its clients and further shows that Spag, unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tah1, performs essential functions in metazoans. Interaction of Spag with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggests a model whereby R2TP would accompany clients from Hsp70 to Hsp90 to facilitate their assembly into macromolecular complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1983964374,"α-L-arabinofuranosidases are glycoside hydrolases that specifically hydrolyze non-reducing residues from arabinose-containing polysaccharides. In the case of arabinoxylans, which are the main components of hemicellulose, they are part of microbial xylanolytic systems and are necessary for complete breakdown of arabinoxylans. Glycoside hydrolase family 62 (GH62) is currently a small family of α-L-arabinofuranosidases that contains only bacterial and fungal members. Little is known about the GH62 mechanism of action, because only a few members have been biochemically characterized and no three-dimensional structure is available. Here, we present the first crystal structures of two fungal GH62 α-L-arabinofuranosidases from the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis (UmAbf62A) and ascomycete Podospora anserina (PaAbf62A). Both enzymes are able to efficiently remove the α-L-arabinosyl substituents from arabinoxylan. The overall three-dimensional structure of UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A reveals a five-bladed β-propeller fold that confirms their predicted classification into clan GH-F together with GH43 α-L-arabinofuranosidases. Crystallographic structures of the complexes with arabinose and cellotriose reveal the important role of subsites +1 and +2 for sugar binding. Intriguingly, we observed that PaAbf62A was inhibited by cello-oligosaccharides and displayed binding affinity to cellulose although no activity was observed on a range of cellulosic substrates. Bioinformatic analyses showed that UmAbf62A and PaAbf62A belong to two distinct subfamilies within the GH62 family. The results presented here provide a framework to better investigate the structure-function relationships within the GH62 family."

However, imaging fatty acid distribution and dynamics in vivo, at the cellular or organismal level is challenging. We developed a label-free method for visualizing lipid depositions in vivo, based on third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy. THG imaging requires a single pulsed-laser light source, alleviating the technical challenges of implementing coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy (CARS) to detect fat stores in living cells. We demonstrate that THG can be used to efficiently and reliably visualize lipid droplets in Caenorhabditis elegans. Thus, THG microscopy offers a versatile alternative to fluorescence and dye-based approaches for lipid biology research."
https://openalex.org/W1995311311,"Background Tyrosinase (TYR) catalyzes the rate-limiting, first step in melanin production and its gene (TYR) is mutated in many cases of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1), an autosomal recessive cause of childhood blindness. Patients with reduced TYR activity are classified as OCA1B; some OCA1B mutations are temperature-sensitive. Therapeutic research for OCA1 has been hampered, in part, by the absence of purified, active, recombinant wild-type and mutant human enzymes. Methodology/Principal Findings The intra-melanosomal domain of human tyrosinase (residues 19–469) and two OCA1B related temperature-sensitive mutants, R422Q and R422W were expressed in insect cells and produced in T. ni larvae. The short trans-membrane fragment was deleted to avoid potential protein insolubility, while preserving all other functional features of the enzymes. Purified tyrosinase was obtained with a yield of >1 mg per 10 g of larval biomass. The protein was a monomeric glycoenzyme with maximum enzyme activity at 37°C and neutral pH. The two purified mutants when compared to the wild-type protein were less active and temperature sensitive. These differences are associated with conformational perturbations in secondary structure. Conclusions/Significance The intramelanosomal domains of recombinant wild-type and mutant human tyrosinases are soluble monomeric glycoproteins with activities which mirror their in vivo function. This advance allows for the structure – function analyses of different mutant TYR proteins and correlation with their corresponding human phenotypes; it also provides an important tool to discover drugs that may improve tyrosinase activity and treat OCA1."
https://openalex.org/W2014930981,"Background Despite the increasing interest towards the biological role of L-ergothioneine, little is known about the serum concentrations of this unusual aminothiol in older adults. We addressed this issue in a representative sample of community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults. Methods Body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum concentrations of L-ergothioneine, taurine, homocysteine, cysteine, glutathione, cysteinylglycine, and glutamylcysteine were evaluated in 439 subjects (age 55–85 years) randomly selected from the Hunter Community Study. Results Median L-ergothioneine concentration in the entire cohort was 1.01 IQR 0.78–1.33 µmol/L. Concentrations were not affected by gender (P = 0.41) or by presence of chronic medical conditions (P = 0.15). By considering only healthy subjects, we defined a reference interval for L-ergothioneine serum concentrations from 0.36 (90% CI 0.31–0.44) to 3.08 (90% CI 2.45–3.76) µmol/L. Using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis L-ergothioneine was negatively correlated with age (rpartial = −0.15; P = 0.0018) and with glutamylcysteine concentrations (rpartial = −0.13; P = 0.0063). Conclusions A thorough analysis of serum L-ergothioneine concentrations was performed in a large group of community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults. Reference intervals were established. Age and glutamylcysteine were independently negatively associated with L-ergothioneine serum concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2056784586,"Pathogenic spirochetes cause clinically relevant diseases in humans and animals, such as Lyme disease and leptospirosis. The causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, and the causative agent of leptospirosis, Leptospria interrogans, encounter reactive oxygen species (ROS) during their enzootic cycles. This report demonstrated that physiologically relevant concentrations of pyruvate, a potent H2O2 scavenger, and provided passive protection to B. burgdorferi and L. interrogans against H2O2. When extracellular pyruvate was absent, both spirochetes were sensitive to a low dose of H2O2 (≈0.6 µM per h) generated by glucose oxidase (GOX). Despite encoding a functional catalase, L. interrogans was more sensitive than B. burgdorferi to H2O2 generated by GOX, which may be due to the inherent resistance of B. burgdorferi because of the virtual absence of intracellular iron. In B. burgdorferi, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathways were important for survival during H2O2 challenge since deletion of the uvrB or the mutS genes enhanced its sensitivity to H2O2 killing; however, the presence of pyruvate fully protected ΔuvrB and ΔmutS from H2O2 killing further demonstrating the importance of pyruvate in protection. These findings demonstrated that pyruvate, in addition to its classical role in central carbon metabolism, serves as an important H2O2 scavenger for pathogenic spirochetes. Furthermore, pyruvate reduced ROS generated by human neutrophils in response to the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist zymosan. In addition, pyruvate reduced neutrophil-derived ROS in response to B. burgdorferi, which also activates host expression through TLR2 signaling. Thus, pathogenic spirochetes may exploit the metabolite pyruvate, present in blood and tissues, to survive H2O2 generated by the host antibacterial response generated during infection."
https://openalex.org/W1982252348,"We previously showed (Li, L., and Carter, C. W., Jr. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 34736-34745) that increased specificity for tryptophan versus tyrosine by contemporary Bacillus stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) over that of TrpRS Urzyme results entirely from coupling between the anticodon-binding domain and an insertion into the Rossmann-fold known as Connecting Peptide 1. We show that this effect is closely related to a long range catalytic effect, in which side chain repacking in a region called the D1 Switch, accounts fully for the entire catalytic contribution of the catalytic Mg(2+) ion. We report intrinsic and higher order interaction effects on the specificity ratio, (kcat/Km)Trp/(kcat/Km)Tyr, of 15 combinatorial mutants from a previous study (Weinreb, V., Li, L., and Carter, C. W., Jr. (2012) Structure 20, 128-138) of the catalytic role of the D1 Switch. Unexpectedly, the same four-way interaction both activates catalytic assist by Mg(2+) ion and contributes -4.4 kcal/mol to the free energy of the specificity ratio. A minimum action path computed for the induced-fit and catalytic conformation changes shows that repacking of the four residues precedes a decrease in the volume of the tryptophan-binding pocket. We suggest that previous efforts to alter amino acid specificities of TrpRS and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) by mutagenesis without extensive, modular substitution failed because mutations were incompatible with interdomain motions required for catalysis."

Functional cooperativity of CaSR (i.e., based on biological activity determined using functional assays rather than a direct binding assay), particularly the functional positive homotropic cooperative response to [Ca2+]o, is essential for the ability of the receptor to respond over a narrow physiological range of [Ca2+]o (1.1–1.3 mm) (3.Breitwieser G.E.

In the present study, we use two complementary approaches—monitoring [Ca2+]i oscillations in living cells and performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations—to provide important insights into how the CaSR functions and the behavior of the receptor at the atomic level. We first demonstrate that the molecular connectivity between [Ca2+]o-binding sites that is encoded within key Ca2+-binding site 1 in the hinge region of the CaSR ECD is responsible for the functional positive homotropic cooperativity in the CaSR response to [Ca2+]o. We further identify an l-Phe-binding pocket adjacent to Ca2+-binding site 1. We show that occupancy of this binding pocket by l-Phe is essential for functional positive heterotropic cooperativity by virtue of its having a marked impact on all five of the predicted Ca2+-binding sites in the ECD with regard to [Ca2+]o-evoked [Ca2+]i signaling. Furthermore, with MD simulations, we show that the simulated motions of Ca2+-binding site 1 are correlated with those of the other predicted Ca2+-binding sites. Finally, the dynamic communication of l-Phe at its predicted binding site in the hinge region with the CaSR Ca2+-binding sites not only influences the adjacent [Ca2+]o binding site 1 but also globally (i.e., by exerting effects widely over the ECD) enhances cooperative activation of the receptor in response to alterations in [Ca2+]o. The structure of the extracellular domain of CaSR (residues 25–530) was modeled based on the crystal structure of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) (Protein Data Bank codes 1EWT, 1EWK, and 1ISR), and the potential Ca2+-binding sites in the CaSR ECD were predicted using MetalFinder (25.Huang Y.

In brief, the docking center and grid box of the model structure and the rotatable bonds of l-Phe were defined by AutoDock tools 1.5.4. The resultant l-Phe coordinates were combined back to the Protein Data Bank file of the model structure for input into the ligand-protein contacts and contacts of structural units (LPC/CSU) server to analyze interatomic contacts between the ligand and receptor (29.Sobolev V.

The residues within 5 Å around l-Phe were considered as l-Phe-binding residues. Measurement of intracellular free Ca2+ was assessed as described by Huang et al. (30.Huang Y. Zhou Y. Wong H.C.

Briefly, wild type CaSR or its mutants were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells grown on coverslips and cultured for 48 h. The cells were subsequently loaded for 15 min using 4 μm Fura-2 AM in 2 ml of physiological saline buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The coverslips were mounted in a bath chamber on the stage of a Leica DM6000 fluorescence microscope, and the cells were incubated in calcium-free physiological saline buffer for 5 min. The cells were then alternately illuminated with 340- or 380-nm light, and the fluorescence at an emission wavelength 510 nm was recorded in real time as the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ was increased in a stepwise manner in the presence or absence of 5 mm l-Phe. The ratio of the emitted fluorescence intensities resulting from excitation at both wavelengths was utilized as a surrogate for changes in [Ca2+]i and was further plotted and analyzed as a function of [Ca2+]o. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The signals from 30–60 single cells were recorded for each measurement. Oscillations were defined as three successive fluctuations in [Ca2+]i after the initial peak. The [Ca2+]i responses of wild type CaSR and its mutants were measured as described by Huang et al. (25.Huang Y. Zhou Y. Yang W. Butters R. Lee H.W. Li S. Castiblanco A. Brown E.M. Yang J.J. Identification and dissection of Ca2+-binding sites in the extracellular domain of Ca2+-sensing receptor.J.

After the cells reached 90% confluence, they were loaded by incubation with 4 μm Fura-2 AM in 20 mm HEPES, containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1% glucose, and 1% BSA (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed once with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1% glucose, and 1% BSA (bath buffer). The coverslips with transfected, Fura-2-loaded HEK293 cells were placed diagonally in 3-ml quartz cuvettes containing bath buffer. The fluorescence spectra at 510 nm were measured during stepwise increases in [Ca2+]o with alternating excitation at 340 or 380 nm. The ratio of the intensities of the emitted light at 510 nm when excited at 340 or 380 nm was used to monitor changes in [Ca2+]i. The EC50 and Hill constants were fitted using the following Hill equation,ΔS=[M]nKdn+[M]n(Eq. 1) where ΔS is the total signal change in the equation and [M] is the free ligand concentration. MD simulation provides an approach complementary to the experiments in live cells for understanding biomolecular structure, dynamics, and function. The initial coordinates for all the simulations were modeled from the 2.20 Å resolution x-ray crystal structure of mGluR1 with Protein Data Bank code 1EWK (31.Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T.

An initial 2-ns simulation was performed using NOE restraint during the equilibration to reorient the side chains residues in the Ca2+-binding site, but no restraints were used during the actual simulation. A total of three MD simulations were carried out for 50 ns each on the apo-form and ligand-loaded forms. During the simulations, an integration time step of 0.002 ps was used to solve Newton's equation of motion. The long range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method (36.Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. Particle mesh Ewald. An N log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20807) Google Scholar), and a cutoff of 9.0 Å was applied for nonbonded interactions. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were restrained using the SHAKE algorithm (37.Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J. Numerical integration of the cartesian equations of motion of a system with constraints. Molecular dynamics of n-alkanes.J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16896) Google Scholar). The simulations were carried out at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar. A Langevin thermostat was used to regulate the temperature with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps−1. The trajectories were saved every 500 steps (1 ps). The trajectories were analyzed using the ptraj module in Amber 10. Accelerated MD was carried out on the free CaSR ECD using the Rotatable accelerated Molecular Dynamics, (RaMD) method (38.Doshi U. Hamelberg D. Improved statistical sampling and accuracy with accelerated molecular dynamics on rotatable torsions.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2012; 8: 4004-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) implemented in a pmemd module of AMBER on the rotatable torsion. A boost energy, E, of 2,000 kcal/mol was added to the average dihedral energy, and a tuning parameter, α, of 200 kcal/mol was used. The dual boost was also applied to accelerate the diffusive and solvent dynamics as previously described (39.Hamelberg D. de Oliveira C.A. McCammon J.A. Sampling of slow diffusive conformational transitions with accelerated molecular dynamics.J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 127: 155102Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The simulation conditions were similar to that of the normal MD simulations above. Principal component analysis was carried out on the trajectories using the ptraj module in AMBER. The directions of the eigenvectors for the slowest modes were visualized using the Interactive Essential Dynamics plugin (40.Mongan J. Interactive essential dynamics.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2004; 18: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The binding energies for the ligands were calculated using an ensemble-docking method and Autodock vina (28.Trott O. Olson A.J. AutoDock Vina. Improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization, and multithreading.J. Comput. Chem. 2010; 31: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The ensemble of conformations of CaSR was generated using molecular dynamics simulations as described above. Gasteiger charges were assigned to the ligands and CaSR using the Autodock ADT program. The ligands were flexible during docking to each conformation of CaSR using the following parameters: the grid spacing was 1.0 Å; the box size was 25 Å in each dimension, and the center of the box was chosen as the center of the active site of CaSR, with a large enough space to sample all possible ligand conformations within the box. The maximum number of binding modes saved was set to 10. The conformation with the lowest binding energy was used and assumed to be the best binder. Distributions of the binding energies for each ligand were calculated based on the lowest binding energy of each ligand to each conformation in the ensemble of CaSR conformations. Using the ptraj module of AMBER 10, principal component analysis (PCA) (41.Levy R.M. Srinivasan A.R. Olson W.K. McCammon J.A.

Springer, New York2002Google Scholar) was performed on all the atoms of the residues that are 5 Å away from site 1 of CaSR ECD. The covariance matrix of the x, y, and z coordinates of all the atoms obtained from each snapshot of the combined trajectories of the ligand-free CaSR ECD, the Ca2+-loaded form, the form loaded with only l-Phe, and the form loaded with both Ca2+ and l-Phe were calculated. The covariance matrix was further diagonalized to produce orthonormal eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues, ranked on the basis of their corresponding variances. The first three eigenvectors, the principal components that contributed the majority of all the atomic fluctuations, were used to project the conformational space onto them, i.e., along two dimensions. The data are presented as means ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. Statistical analyses were carried out using the unpaired Student's t test when two groups were compared. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. It has been documented that in several regions of the CaSR and mGluRs, the amino acid residues are highly conserved (43.Bai M. Structure-function relationship of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor.Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Those conserved elements provide a structural framework for the modeling of the CaSR ECD. Among all the available crystal structures of the mGluRs, studies on mGluR1 give concrete structural information about ligand-free as well as various ligand-bound forms of the receptor. Moreover, CaSR and mGluR1 share similar signaling pathways and can form heterodimers with one another either in vivo or in vitro (44.Gama L. Wilt S.G. Breitwieser G.E.

The gain and loss of OR genes is typically correlated with adaptations to various ecological niches. Modern humans have 853 OR genes but 55% of these have lost their function. Here we show evidence of additional OR loss of function in the Neanderthal and Denisovan hominin genomes using comparative genomic methodologies. Ten Neanderthal and 8 Denisovan ORs show evidence of loss of function that differ from the reference modern human OR genome. Some of these losses are also present in a subset of modern humans, while some are unique to each lineage. Morphological changes in the cranium of Neanderthals suggest different sensory arrangements to that of modern humans. We identify differences in functional olfactory receptor genes among modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans, suggesting varied loss of function across all three taxa and we highlight the utility of using genomic information to elucidate the sensory niches of extinct species."

https://openalex.org/W2021221959,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway plays an important role in cancer biology. The IGF 1 receptor (IGF1R) overexpression has been associated with a number of hematological neoplasias and solid tumors including breast cancer. However, molecular mechanism involving IGF1R in carcinogenic developments is clearly not known. We investigated the genetic variations across the IGF1R polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer risk in Korean women. A total of 1418 individuals comprising 1026 breast cancer cases and 392 age-matched controls of Korean were included for the analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed on the GoldenGate Assay system by Illumina's Custom Genetic Analysis service. SNPs were selected for linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis by Haploview. We genotyped total 51 SNPs in the IGF1R gene and examined for association with breast cancer. All the SNPs investigated were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These SNPs tested were significantly associated with breast cancer risk, after correction for multiple comparisons by adjusting for age at diagnosis, BMI, age at menarche, and age at first parturition. Among 51 IGF1R SNPs, five intron located SNPs (rs8032477, rs7175052, rs12439557, rs11635251 and rs12916884) with homozygous genotype (variant genotype) were associated with decreased risk of breast cancer. Fisher's combined p-value for the five SNPs was 0.00032. Three intron located SNPs with heterozygous genotypes also had decreased risk of breast cancer. Seven of the 51 IGF1R SNPs were in LD and in one haplotype block, and were likely to be associated with breast cancer risk. Overall, this case-control study demonstrates statistically significant associations between breast cancer risk and polymorphisms in IGF1R gene."
https://openalex.org/W2061086491,"Background Oestrogen receptor (ER) positive (luminal) tumours account for the largest proportion of females with breast cancer. Theirs is a heterogeneous disease presenting clinical challenges in managing their treatment. Three main biological luminal groups have been identified but clinically these can be distilled into two prognostic groups in which Luminal A are accorded good prognosis and Luminal B correlate with poor prognosis. Further biomarkers are needed to attain classification consensus. Machine learning approaches like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used for classification and identification of biomarkers in breast cancer using high throughput data. In this study, we have used an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to identify DACH1 as a candidate luminal marker and its role in predicting clinical outcome in breast cancer is assessed. Materials and methods A reiterative ANN approach incorporating a network inferencing algorithm was used to identify ER-associated biomarkers in a publically available cDNA microarray dataset. DACH1 was identified in having a strong influence on ER associated markers and a positive association with ER. Its clinical relevance in predicting breast cancer specific survival was investigated by statistically assessing protein expression levels after immunohistochemistry in a series of unselected breast cancers, formatted as a tissue microarray. Results Strong nuclear DACH1 staining is more prevalent in tubular and lobular breast cancer. Its expression correlated with ER-alpha positive tumours expressing PgR, epithelial cytokeratins (CK)18/19 and ‘luminal-like’ markers of good prognosis including FOXA1 and RERG (p<0.05). DACH1 is increased in patients showing longer cancer specific survival and disease free interval and reduced metastasis formation (p<0.001). Nuclear DACH1 showed a negative association with markers of aggressive growth and poor prognosis. Conclusion Nuclear DACH1 expression appears to be a Luminal A biomarker predictive of good prognosis, but is not independent of clinical stage, tumour size, NPI status or systemic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2051453899,"Extensively developed for medical and clinical applications, flow cytometry is now being used for diverse applications in food microbiology. Most uses of flow cytometry for yeast cells are derived from methods for mammalian cells, but yeast cells can present specificities that must be taken into account for rigorous analysis of the data output to avoid any misinterpretation. We report an analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle progression that highlights possible errors. The cell cycle was analyzed using an intercalating fluorochrome to assess cell DNA content. In analyses of yeast cultures, the presence of a sub-G1 peak in the fluorescent signal is often interpreted as a loss of DNA due to its fragmentation associated with apoptosis. However, the cell wall and its stucture may interfere with the fluorescent signal recorded. These observations indicate that misinterpretation of yeast DNA profiles is possible in analyses based on some of the most common probes: cells in G0 appeared to have a lower DNA content and may have been mistaken as a sub-G1 population. However, careful selection of the fluorochrome for DNA quantification allowed a direct discrimination between G0 and G1 yeast cell cycle steps, without additional labeling. We present and discuss results obtained with five current fluorochromes. These observations led us to recommend to use SYTOX Green for cycle analysis of living cells and SYBR Green I for the identification of the apoptosis sub-G1 population identification or the DNA ploidy application."

Solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4) gene encode serotonin transporter (SERT) which function is to rapidly reuptake the most of 5-HT. Therefore, it is needed to explore the association between SLC6A4 gene polymorphisms and IBS.119 patients and 238 healthy controls were administrated to detect the SLC6A4 gene polymorphisms including 5-HT-transporter-gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) and three selected tag Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1042173, rs3794808, rs2020936 by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and TaqMan® SNP Genotyping.There were significant difference for 5-HTTLPR between IBS and control groups (X2 = 106.168, P<0.0001). In control group, genotypes were mainly L/L (58.4%), however, the genotypes in IBS were S/S (37.8%). The significant difference was shown in D-IBS subjects when compared to the controls (X(2) = 50.850, P<0.0001) for 5-HTTLPR. For STin2 VNTR, rs1042173, rs3794808, and rs2020936 polymorphisms, there were no any significant differences between IBS and control groups. There were no statistical significantly haplotypes for 5-HTTLPR, VNTRs and the three SNPs between IBS and controls.The S allele in 5-HTTLPR was a susceptible allele with Chinese Han IBS, but other associations of VNTRs, three selected Tag SNPs and positive haplotype with IBS were not found.

https://openalex.org/W2087103195,"Doxorubicin is one of the most widely used anti-cancer drugs, but its clinical application is compromised by severe adverse effects in different organs including cardiotoxicity. In the present study we explored mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity by revealing a novel role for the AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPKα2) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Doxorubicin robustly induced the expression of AMPKα2 in MEFs but slightly reduced AMPKα1 expression. Our data support the previous notion that AMPKα1 harbors survival properties under doxorubicin treatment. In contrast, analyses of Ampkα2(-/-) MEFs, gene knockdown of AMPKα2 by shRNA, and inhibition of AMPKα2 activity with an AMPK inhibitor indicated that AMPKα2 functions as a pro-apoptotic molecule under doxorubicin treatment. Doxorubicin induced AMPKα2 at the transcription level via E2F1, a transcription factor that regulates apoptosis in response to DNA damage. E2F1 directly transactivated the Ampkα2 gene promoter. In turn, AMPKα2 significantly contributed to stabilization and activation of E2F1 by doxorubicin, forming a positive signal amplification loop. AMPKα2 directly interacted with and phosphorylated E2F1. This signal loop was also detected in H9c2, C2C12, and ECV (human epithelial cells) cells as well as mouse liver under doxorubicin treatment. Resveratrol, which has been suggested to attenuate doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity, significantly blocked induction of AMPKα2 and E2F1 by doxorubicin, leading to protection of these cells. This signal loop appears to be non-carcinoma-specific because AMPKα2 was not induced by doxorubicin in five different tested cancer cell lines. These results suggest that AMPKα2 may serve as a novel target for alleviating the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin."
https://openalex.org/W2037457588,"We investigated the vision-related quality of life (VR-QOL) and the prevalence and severity of depression in patients with herpetic anterior uveitis (AU). This study was conducted in 2012 at the ophthalmology department of the University Medical Center of Groningen (tertiary referral center). We selected patients from an existing uveitis database, all eligible patients were approached. Thirty-six of 66 (55%) patients with herpetic AU (herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus) participated, patients were 18 years or older. The diagnosis was made by clinical presentation or a positive anterior chamber tap. All patients received an information letter, informed consent form, National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Social Support List – Interactions (SSL-I), Social Support List – Discrepancies (SSL-D) and an additional questionnaire for gathering general information. Medical records were reviewed for clinical characteristics. Analyses were conducted on various patient and ocular characteristics. We compared our NEI VFQ-25 scores with those previously found in the literature. Our main outcome measures were VR-QOL, prevalence and severity of depression, social support and various patient and ocular characteristics that could influence the VR-QOL. We found that the NEI VFQ-25 mean overall composite score (OCS) was 88.1±10.6. Compared with other ocular diseases our OCS is relatively high, but lower than that found in a normal working population. The mean general health score was 59.0±19.0; this score is lower than in patients with other ocular diseases, except for untreated Behçet’s patients. Depression was scarce, with only one patient (2.8%) having a moderate depression (BDI-II score of 21). We concluded that herpetic AU affects the VR-QOL in a moderate way. The prevalence of depression in our group of herpetic AU patients was low and therefore does not seem to indicate a need for specific screening and intervention measures in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W1980010786,"The fungal genus Trichosporon contains emerging opportunistic pathogens of humans, and is the third most commonly isolated non-candidal yeast from humans. Trichosporon asahii and T. asteroides are the most important species causing disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients, while inhalation of T. asahii spores is the most important cause of summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis in healthy individuals. Trichosporonosis is misdiagnosed as candidiasis or cryptococcosis due to a lack of awareness and the ambiguity of diagnostic tests for these pathogens. In this study, hybridoma technology was used to produce two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), CA7 and TH1, for detection and differentiation of Trichosporon from other human pathogenic yeasts and moulds. The MAbs react with extracellular antigens from T. asahii and T. asteroides, but do not recognise other related Trichosporon spp., or unrelated pathogenic yeasts and moulds including Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Scedosporium spp., or the etiologic agents of mucormycosis. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting studies show that MAb CA7, an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), binds to a major 60 kDa glycoprotein antigen produced on the surface of hyphae, while TH1, an immunoglobulin M (IgM), binds to an antigen produced on the surface of conidia. The MAbs were used in combination with a standard mycological growth medium (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar) to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for differentiation of T. asahii from Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans in single and mixed species cultures. The MAbs represent a major advance in the identification of T. asahii and T. asteroides using standard mycological identification methods."
https://openalex.org/W2123329382,"Neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the neocortex exhibit a high proliferation capacity during early embryonic development and give rise to cortical projection neurons after maturation. Necdin, a mammal-specific MAGE (melanoma antigen) family protein that possesses anti-mitotic and pro-survival activities, is expressed abundantly in postmitotic neurons and moderately in tissue-specific stem cells or progenitors. Necdin interacts with E2F transcription factors and suppresses E2F1-dependent transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 gene. Here we show that necdin serves as a suppressor of NPC proliferation in the embryonic neocortex. Necdin is moderately expressed in the ventricular zone of mouse embryonic neocortex, in which proliferative cell populations are significantly increased in necdin-null mice. In the neocortex of necdin-null embryos, expression of Cdk1 and Sox2, a stem cell marker, is significantly increased, whereas expression of p16, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is markedly diminished. Cdk1 and p16 expression levels are also significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in primary NPCs prepared from necdin-null embryos. Intriguingly, necdin interacts directly with Bmi1, a Polycomb group protein that suppresses p16 expression and promotes NPC proliferation. In HEK293A cells transfected with luciferase reporter constructs, necdin relieves Bmi1-dependent repression of p16 promoter activity, whereas Bmi1 counteracts necdin-mediated repression of E2F1-dependent Cdk1 promoter activity. In lentivirus-infected primary NPCs, necdin overexpression increases p16 expression, suppresses Cdk1 expression, and inhibits NPC proliferation, whereas Bmi1 overexpression suppresses p16 expression, increases Cdk1 expression, and promotes NPC proliferation. Our data suggest that embryonic NPC proliferation in the neocortex is regulated by the antagonistic interplay between necdin and Bmi1."

Although inflammatory diseases of the liver are frequently associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, the underlying immunological mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here we report two murine models of inflammatory bowel disease: RAG-2−/− mice adoptively transferred with CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells; and IL-10−/− mice, accompanied by the infiltration of mononuclear cells in the liver. Notably, CD11b−CD11clowPDCA-1+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) abundantly residing in the liver of normal wild-type mice disappeared in colitic CD4+CD45RBhigh T cell-transferred RAG-2−/− mice and IL-10−/− mice in parallel with the emergence of macrophages (Mφs) and conventional DCs (cDCs). Furthermore, liver Mφ/cDCs emerging during intestinal inflammation not only promote the proliferation of naïve CD4+ T cells, but also instruct them to differentiate into IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells in vitro. The emergence of pathological Mφ/cDCs in the liver also occurred in a model of acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis under specific pathogen-free conditions, but was canceled in germ-free conditions. Last, the Mφ/cDCs that emerged in acute DSS colitis significantly exacerbated Fas-mediated hepatitis. Collectively, intestinal inflammation skews the composition of antigen-presenting cells in the liver through signaling from commensal bacteria and predisposes the liver to inflammation."

Even though this clinical treatment has been developing for several decades, the proton radiobiology critical to the optimization of proton radiotherapy is far from being understood. Proteomic changes were analyzed in human melanoma cells treated with a sublethal dose (3 Gy) of proton beam irradiation. The results were compared with untreated cells. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed with mass spectrometry to identify the proteins. At the dose of 3 Gy a minimal slowdown in proliferation rate was seen, as well as some DNA damage. After allowing time for damage repair, the proteomic analysis was performed. In total 17 protein levels were found to significantly (more than 1.5 times) change: 4 downregulated and 13 upregulated. Functionally, they represent four categories: (i) DNA repair and RNA regulation (VCP, MVP, STRAP, FAB-2, Lamine A/C, GAPDH), (ii) cell survival and stress response (STRAP, MCM7, Annexin 7, MVP, Caprin-1, PDCD6, VCP, HSP70), (iii) cell metabolism (TIM, GAPDH, VCP), and (iv) cytoskeleton and motility (Moesin, Actinin 4, FAB-2, Vimentin, Annexin 7, Lamine A/C, Lamine B). A substantial decrease (2.3 x) was seen in the level of vimentin, a marker of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and the metastatic properties of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2110734570,"Basal activity of the BB Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE3 requires multiprotein complexes that form on its C terminus. One complex stimulates basal NHE3 activity and contains ezrin and phosphoinositides as major components; how it stimulates NHE3 activity is not known. This study tested the hypothesis that ezrin dynamically associates with this complex, which sets ezrin binding. NHE3 activity was reduced by an Akti. This effect was eliminated if ezrin binding to NHE3 was inhibited by a point mutant. Recombinant AKT phosphorylated NHE3 C terminus in the domain ezrin directly binds. This domain (amino acids 475-589) is predicted to be α-helical and contains a conserved cluster of three serines (Ser(515), Ser(522), and Ser(526)). Point mutations of two of these (S515A, S515D, or S526A) reduced basal NHE3 activity and surface expression and had no Akti inhibition. S526D had NHE3 activity equal to wild type with normal Akti inhibition. Ezrin binding to NHE3 was regulated by Akt, being eliminated by Akti. NHE3-S515A and -S526D did not bind ezrin; NHE3-S515D had reduced ezrin binding; NHE3-S526D bound ezrin normally. NHE3-Ser(526) is predicted to be a GSK-3 kinase phosphorylation site. A GSK-3 inhibitor reduced basal NHE3 activity as well as ezrin-NHE3 binding, and this effect was eliminated in NHE3-S526A and -S526D mutants. The conclusions were: 1) NHE3 basal activity is regulated by a signaling complex that is controlled by sequential effects of two kinases, Akt and GSK-3, which act on a Ser cluster in the same NHE3 C-terminal domain that binds ezrin; and 2) these kinases regulate the dynamic association of ezrin with NHE3 to affect basal NHE3 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2000671129,"Xylitol has been used as a substitute for sugar to prevent cavity-causing bacteria, and most studies have focused on its benefits in dental care. Meanwhile, the constituents of red ginseng (RG) are known to be effective in ameliorating the symptoms of influenza virus infection when they are administered orally for 14 days. In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary xylitol on influenza A virus infection (H1N1). We designed regimens containing various fractions of RG (RGs: whole extract, water soluble fraction, saponin and polysaccharide) and xylitol, and combination of xylitol with the RG fractions. Mice received the various combinations orally for 5 days prior to lethal influenza A virus infection. Almost all the mice died post challenge when xylitol or RGs were administered separately. Survival was markedly enhanced when xylitol was administered along with RGs, pointing to a synergistic effect. The effect of xylitol plus RG fractions increased with increasing dose of xylitol. Moreover, dietary xylitol along with the RG water soluble fraction significantly reduced lung virus titers after infection. Therefore, we suggest that dietary xylitol is effective in ameliorating influenza-induced symptoms when it is administered with RG fractions, and this protective effect of xylitol should be considered in relation to other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2017210503,"Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) is known to promote osteoclast progenitor survival, but its roles in osteoclast differentiation and mature osteoclast function are less well understood. In a microarray screen, Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) was identified as significantly induced by CSF1. Recent reports indicate that JDP2 is required for normal osteoclastogenesis and skeletal metabolism. Because there are no reports on the transcriptional regulation of this gene, the DNA sequence from -2612 to +682 bp (relative to the transcription start site) of the JDP2 gene was cloned, and promoter activity was analyzed. The T box-binding element (TBE) between -191 and -141 bp was identified as the cis-element responsible for CSF1-dependent JDP2 expression. Using degenerate PCR, Tbx3 was identified as the major isoform binding the TBE. Overexpression of Tbx3 induced JDP2 promoter activity, whereas suppressing Tbx3 expression substantially attenuated CSF1-induced transcription. Suppressing Tbx3 in osteoclast precursors reduced JDP2 expression and significantly impaired RANKL/CSF1-induced osteoclastogenesis. A MEK1/2-specific inhibitor was found to block CSF1-induced JDP2 expression. Consistent with these data, JDP2(-/-) mice were found to have increased bone mass. In summary, CSF1 up-regulates JDP2 expression by inducing Tbx3 binding to the JDP2 promoter. The downstream signaling cascade from activated c-Fms involves the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. Tbx3 plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis at least in part by regulating CSF1-dependent expression of JDP2."
https://openalex.org/W2084988868,"Disruption of the renal endothelial integrity is pivotal for the development of a vascular leak, tissue edema and consequently acute kidney injury. Kidney ischemia amplifies endothelial activation and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. After restoring a sufficient blood flow, the kidney is damaged through complex pathomechanisms that are classically referred to as ischemia and reperfusion injury, where the disruption of the inter-endothelial connections seems to be a crucial step in this pathomechanism. Focusing on the molecular cell-cell interaction, the fibrinopeptide Bβ15–42 prevents vascular leakage by stabilizing these inter-endothelial junctions. The peptide associates with vascular endothelial-cadherin, thus preventing early kidney dysfunction by preserving blood perfusion efficacy, edema formation and thus organ dysfunction. We intended to demonstrate the early therapeutic benefit of intravenously administered Bβ15–42 in a mouse model of renal ischemia and reperfusion. After 30 minutes of ischemia, the fibrinopeptide Bβ15–42 was administered intravenously before reperfusion was commenced for 1 and 3 hours. We show that Bβ15–42 alleviates early functional and morphological kidney damage as soon as 1 h and 3 h after ischemia and reperfusion. Mice treated with Bβ15–42 displayed a significantly reduced loss of VE-cadherin, indicating a conserved endothelial barrier leading to less neutrophil infiltration which in turn resulted in significantly reduced structural renal damage. The significant reduction in tissue and serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels reinforced our findings. Moreover, renal perfusion analysis by color duplex sonography revealed that Bβ15–42 treatment preserved resistive indices and even improved blood velocity. Our data demonstrate the efficacy of early therapeutic intervention using the fibrinopeptide Bβ15–42 in the treatment of acute kidney injury resulting from ischemia and reperfusion. In this context Bβ15–42 may act as a potent renoprotective agent by preserving the endothelial and vascular integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1964510482,"Flap endonucleases remove flap structures generated during DNA replication. Gene 6 protein of bacteriophage T7 is a 5'-3'-exonuclease specific for dsDNA. Here we show that gene 6 protein also possesses a structure-specific endonuclease activity similar to known flap endonucleases. The flap endonuclease activity is less active relative to its exonuclease activity. The major cleavage by the endonuclease activity occurs at a position one nucleotide into the duplex region adjacent to a dsDNA-ssDNA junction. The efficiency of cleavage of the flap decreases with increasing length of the 5'-overhang. A 3'-single-stranded tail arising from the same end of the duplex as the 5'-tail inhibits gene 6 protein flap endonuclease activity. The released flap is not degraded further, but the exonuclease activity then proceeds to hydrolyze the 5'-terminal strand of the duplex. T7 gene 2.5 single-stranded DNA-binding protein stimulates the exonuclease and also the endonuclease activity. This stimulation is attributed to a specific interaction between the two proteins because Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein does not produce this stimulatory effect. The ability of gene 6 protein to remove 5'-terminal overhangs as well as to remove nucleotides from the 5'-termini enables it to effectively process the 5'-termini of Okazaki fragments before they are ligated."
https://openalex.org/W1982219573,"This study compared fatigue development of the triceps surae induced by two electrical stimulation protocols composed of constant and variable frequency trains (CFTs, VFTs, 450 trains, 30 Hz, 167 ms ON, 500 ms OFF and 146 ms ON, 500 ms OFF respectively). For the VFTs protocol a doublet (100 Hz) was used at the beginning of each train. The intensity used evoked 30% of a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and was defined using CFTs. Neuromuscular tests were performed before and after each protocol. Changes in excitation-contraction coupling were assessed by analysing the M-wave [at rest (Mmax) and during MVC (Msup)] and associated peak twitch (Pt). H-reflex [at rest (Hmax) and during MVC (Hsup)] and the motor evoked potential (MEP) during MVC were studied to assess spinal and corticospinal excitability of the soleus muscle. MVC decrease was similar between the protocols (-8%, P<0.05). Mmax, Msup and Pt decreased after both protocols (P<0.01). Hmax/Mmax was decreased (P<0.05), whereas Hsup/Msup and MEP/Msup remained unchanged after both protocols. The results indicate that CFTs and VFTs gave rise to equivalent neuromuscular fatigue. This fatigue resulted from alterations taking place at the muscular level. The finding that cortical and spinal excitability remained unchanged during MVC indicates that spinal and/or supraspinal mechanisms were activated to compensate for the loss of spinal excitability at rest."
https://openalex.org/W2159796719,"To decipher early promoters of the local microenvironment for Th2-type immunity, we wanted to identify gene patterns that were induced by Leishmania major in the infected skin of susceptible, Th2-prone BALB/c, but not of resistant, Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice. We found a marked up-regulation of the chemokine I-TAC (Cxc111) during the first 2 d of infection in the epidermis of susceptible but not of resistant mice. Accordingly, local injection of I-TAC (2×1 μg) in resistant mice on the first day of infection resulted in a Th2-driven, sustained deterioration of disease and dramatically enhanced parasite levels. On the cellular level, I-TAC decreased IL-12 production by dendritic cells (DCs) in skin-draining lymph nodes and by DCs in vitro. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that epidermis-derived I-TAC triggers a sustained Th2-response that determines the outcome of a complex immunological process.—Roebrock, K., Sunderkotter, C., Münck, N-A., Wolf, M., Nippe, N., Barczyk, K., Varga, G., Vogl, T., Roth, J., Ehrchen, J.

https://openalex.org/W2029136419,"High mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 5 (HMGN5) is a chromatin architectural protein that binds specifically to nucleosomes and reduces the compaction of the chromatin fiber. The protein is present in most vertebrate tissues however the physiological function of this protein is unknown. To examine the function of HMGN5 in vivo, mice lacking the nucleosome-binding domain of HMGN5 were generated and characterized. Serological analysis revealed that compared to wild-type littermates (Hmgn5+/Y), mice with a targeted mutation in the HMGN5 gene (Hmgn5tm1/Y), had elevated serum albumin, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and alanine transaminase, suggesting mild hepatic abnormalities. Metabolomics analysis of liver extracts and urine revealed clear differences in metabolites between Hmgn5tm1/Y and their Hmgn5+/Y littermates. Hmgn5tm1/Y mice had a significant increase in hepatic glutathione levels and decreased urinary concentrations of betaine, phenylacetylglycine, and creatine, all of which are metabolically related to the glutathione precursor glycine. Microarray and qPCR analysis revealed that expression of two genes affecting glutathione metabolism, glutathione peroxidase 6 (Gpx6) and hexokinase 1 (Hk1), was significantly decreased in Hmgn5tm1/Y mouse liver tissue. Analysis of chromatin structure by DNase I digestion revealed alterations in the chromatin structure of these genes in the livers of Hmgn5tm1/Y mice. Thus, functional loss of HMGN5 leads to changes in transcription of Gpx6 and Hk1 that alter glutathione metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2092133827,"Australian clinical guidelines recommend endocrine therapy for all women with hormone-dependent early breast cancer. Guidelines specify tamoxifen as first-line therapy for pre-menopausal women, and tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) for post-menopausal women depending on the risk of recurrence based on tumour characteristics including size. Therapies have different side effect profiles; therefore comorbidity may also influence choice. We examined comorbidity, and the clinical and demographic characteristics of women commencing different therapies.We identified the first dispensing of tamoxifen, anastrozole or letrozole for women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the 45 and Up Study from 2004-2009 (N = 1266). Unit-level pharmacy and medical service claims, hospital, Cancer Registry, and self-reported data were linked to determine menopause status at diagnosis, tumour size, age, comorbidities, and change in subsidy restrictions. Chi-square tests and generalised regression models were used to compare the characteristics of women commencing different therapies.Most pre-menopausal women commenced therapy with tamoxifen (91%). Anastrozole was the predominant therapy for post-menopausal women (57%), followed by tamoxifen (28%). Women with osteoporosis were less likely to commence anastrozole compared with tamoxifen (anastrozole RR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.5-0.9). Women with arthritis were 1.6-times more likely to commence letrozole than anastrozole (95% CI = 1.1-2.1). Tamoxifen was more often initiated in women with tumours >1 cm, who were also ≥75 years. Subsidy restriction changes were associated with substantial increases in the proportion of women commencing AIs (anastrozole RR = 4.3, letrozole RR = 8.3).The findings indicate interplay of comorbidity and therapy choice for women with invasive breast cancer. Most post-menopausal women commenced therapy with anastrozole; however, letrozole and tamoxifen were more often initiated for women with comorbid arthritis and osteoporosis, respectively. Tamoxifen was also more common for women with tumours >1 cm and aged ≥75 years. Subsidy restrictions appear to have strongly influenced therapy choice."
https://openalex.org/W1967791273,"Objective The objective of this discovery-level investigation was to use mass spectrometry to identify low mass compounds in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from lung transplant recipients that associate with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Experimental Design Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from lung transplant recipients were evaluated for small molecules using ESI-TOF mass spectrometry and correlated to the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Peptides associated with samples from persons with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and controls were identified separately by MS/MS analysis. Results The average bronchoalveolar lavage fluid MS spectrum profile of individuals that developed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome differed greatly compared to controls. Controls demonstrated close inter-sample correlation (R = 0.97+/−0.02, average+/−SD) while bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome showed greater heterogeneity (R = 0.86+/−0.09, average+/−SD). We identified 89 features that were predictive of developing BOS grade 1 and 66 features predictive of developing BOS grade 2 or higher. Fractions from MS analysis were pooled and evaluated for peptide content. Nearly 10-fold more peptides were found in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome relative to controls. C-terminal residues suggested trypsin-like specificity among controls compared to elastase-type enzymes among those with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Conclusions Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from individuals with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome has an increase in low mass components detected by mass spectrometry. Many of these features were peptides that likely result from elevated neutrophil elastase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2064050229,"No matching vaccine is immediately available when a novel influenza strain breaks out. Several nonvaccine-related strategies must be employed to control an influenza epidemic, including antiviral treatment, patient isolation, and immigration detection. This paper presents the development and application of two regional dynamic models of influenza with Pontryagin's Maximum Principle to determine the optimal control strategies for an epidemic and the corresponding minimum antiviral stockpiles. Antiviral treatment was found to be the most effective measure to control new influenza outbreaks. In the case of inadequate antiviral resources, the preferred approach was the centralized use of antiviral resources in the early stage of the epidemic. Immigration detection was the least cost-effective; however, when used in combination with the other measures, it may play a larger role. The reasonable mix of the three control measures could reduce the number of clinical cases substantially, to achieve the optimal control of new influenza."
